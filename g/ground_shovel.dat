So the controller is the core component of the laser-control-ground system. The speed of response and the control algorithm of the controller are in relation to the stability and work efficiency of this system. This research uses the RS 485 module to transmit, enhancing the interference immunity of the system, raising the stability when it works in severe environment, replacing SCM with CPLD to carry out the {{function of}} logical control, cutting down the power consumption of the system. It interferes manually in the hydraulic control automatic mode via software, thus improving the stability and flexibility of the system. The function of adjusting the duty cycle of the controller output signal is added, making the controller able to work both in paddy field and dry land...|$|E

There was much jockeying {{to do to}} move shovels: rails and timber blocks to move; cables and block {{purchases}} to attach; chains and slings to rig; and so on. On soft <b>ground,</b> <b>shovels</b> used timber mats to help steady and level the ground. The early models were not self-propelled, rather they would use the boom to manoeuvre themselves.|$|R

Composed of a super-alloy devised by Quickmix, the shovel is impervious to all weapons fire {{short of a}} small nuclear explosion and is often used as a shield. It can lift up to 60 tons and smash through virtually any barrier. In this mode, Scoop has a maximum speed of 80 mph and range of 200 miles. Scoop sometimes utilizes a standard Autobot jet pack. Scoop can wield Tracer and Holepunch in his robot and power shovel modes.|$|R

There were 50 acres of {{middling}} woods, the foundation of an old house, and a price of $4000. The landscape was suitable more for scouting activities. It seems the buyers liked it enough that on April 16 they paid a deposit of $200. Later they learned from some neighbours that the stream which they hoped to dam next summer was bone dry in the summer. The deposit was not returned, since, as the owners alleged, the claimants had arbitrarily dug into the <b>ground</b> with a <b>shovel,</b> that is, taken possession.|$|R

40|$|In October 1996, the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) of The University of Texas at San Antonio {{completed}} archaeological {{investigations of}} the eastern portion of the interior compound of Mission San Francisco de la Espada. The archaeological testing was undertaken {{in advance of the}} construction of a movie set in the New Plaza of the mission. The staging involved setting up approximately 100 tents, using eight-inch stakes driven about six inches into the <b>ground.</b> Twenty-six <b>shovel</b> tests were excavated across the plaza to locate any culturally sensitive areas which might be affected by the movie set. Pre- 1780 material from the investigated portion of the New Plaza may be earlier trash deposits placed outside of what was then the interior of the compound. A concentration of post-Colonial ceramics in the southern portion of the mission may reflect habitation sites along the south wall throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The results of the shovel testing suggest that the northern portion of the New Plaza may contain intact Spanish colonial deposits. However, 6 to 12 inches of fIll are currently being added to this portion of the plaza as part of a separate drainage improvement project at the mission. We recommend, therefore, that the northern area be avoided, either entirely or until land modification has been completed. The proposed disturbances will have no effect on Colonial deposits elsewhere in the plaza, and work should be allowed to continue in those areas...|$|R

We observed numerous fields with these symptoms throughout the state this year. The white and yellow female bodies, which form the cysts when they die, should be visible on the soybean roots. To see these cysts, dig the soybean plants out of the <b>ground</b> with a <b>shovel</b> and dip in a bucket of water to observe the new cysts. Care must be taken when digging the plants as the cysts are loosely attached to the soybean roots. Locating the young cysts on the roots is especially important in resistant soybeans, as this is the best indicator of their true resistance. We have been warning you in our previous articles that the field populations of SCN in Indiana are changing in ways that render the most common source of resistance to SCN (PI 88788) less effective. Other researchers in the region have reported similar trends. In the past three years the North Central Soybean Research Program (NCSRP) has funded a collaborative regional project throughout the Midwest to establish large field plots in areas where the PI 88788 type of resistance is no longer effective.

They dug the <b>ground</b> with small <b>shovel</b> and built small house which used rafter, column. Woods was used for rafter and column, straw was used for roof. In Bronze Age, there were several columns in the house, so the area of house was extended rather than neolithic house. Iron Age's house had Ondol so house had heating system from that time. The house also used Giwa, a kind of roofing tile which was made with baked soil. By using Giwa roof tile, hanok got {{to have its own}} specific shape. The time of enlightenment After or during the time of enlightenment, lots of foreginers visited, stayed and lived in Korea. For this reason, Christianity was peppered throughout in Korea. Especially, Anglicanism, Catholic tried to be naturalized. So they built their church using Korean traditional architecture. This church is located in Ganghwa County, Jincheon County, Cheongju. [...] South KoreaFrom the 1970s, the old architects learned today's architecture, they aware hanok as an old day's antiquated and inefficient architecture and demolished a lot of hanoks of historical value have been disappeared.

However, the value of hanok has been highlighted from the 2000s the efficient of hanok's eco-friendly function and healing effectiveness has been emphasized. Today, {{the number of people who}} tries to move in hanok is growing rapidly to cure the diseases such as atopy, asthma which are mainly caused by environment.

Paulie becomes more demanding of his regular payments and subjects Chris to a humiliating random strip search for wires. Things get heated when Paulie and Patsy Parisi show up unexpectedly at Christopher's apartment {{to get a}} take of Chris's loot. While meddling through a dresser drawer, Chris observes Paulie sniffing Adriana's panties, about which he later complains to Tony, who chides Paulie. The tensions between Paulie and Chris culminate in [...] "Pine Barrens" [...] when Tony assigns Paulie and Chris the task of collecting a payment owed to Silvio by a Russian mobster named Valery. They botch the simple assignment after they get into a fight with Valery at his apartment. Believing Valery is dead after Paulie chokes him with a lamp, they take Valery out into the Pine Barrens to dispose of him. Valery, who is later revealed to be a former Russian military commando, is still alive, and knocks both Paulie and Chris to the <b>ground</b> with a <b>shovel.</b> He escapes and leads Paulie and Chris on a brief chase in the woods. Paulie shoots Valery in the head; however, he and Chris are unable to find the seemingly mortally wounded Valery, and the two are dumbfounded {{as to what happened}} to him. Afterwards, Paulie and Chris decide to get in the car and look for him, but they lose their way. They become hungry, extremely cold, tired, and frustrated with each other. Later, a heated exchange prompts Chris to pull his gun and threaten to kill Paulie. The next morning, they are rescued by Tony and Bobby Baccalieri, but Tony is disappointed at Paulie's failure to complete such an easy task.|$|R
