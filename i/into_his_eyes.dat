5|$|According to Malhotra, most of {{the action}} stunts in the film were shot by Roshan and Dutt themselves, while body doubles were used to film a few scenes. Several {{accidents}} {{took place during the}} filming of Agneepath. Priyanka Chopra's lehenga caught fire, while shooting for an elaborate Ganpati festival song. Hrithik Roshan too scalded his hands while shooting for the same scene. Roshan also suffered from an eye injury during the shoot of a song, when holi colours were flung <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> by some junior artists. In October, Roshan suffered from a major back injury while lifting a man weighing 110 kilograms, which was a part of an elaborate action sequence. Shooting was stalled for some time following the incident, while Roshan recuperated in a hospital.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina (Chaplin) {{walks down}} the stairs, and Ray puts the {{painting}} back and hides. Sabrina turns down Gerald's music to watch EastEnders. Gerald returns, sitting away from Sabrina. He turns up his music and the pair fight over the television remote, before leaving through the patio door and arguing, though their voices are muffled. Ray cuts away the canvas and replaces it with kitchen roll. When Sabrina reenters, she unknowingly stands on the canvas. Kim picks it up, mistaking it for laundry, and heads into a laundry room as Sabrina walks upstairs. Eddie follows Kim and she sprays something <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> Ray knocks out Kim and sees the canvas in a laundry basket, which is sent up a laundry chute. He runs upstairs, while Gerald remains outside.|$|E

5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just like {{everyone}} else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E
5|$|Laura finds Nicky on a {{basement}} table with hoses attached to her, pumping bile into her body until she explodes. The Boogeyman chases Laura through the hospital; {{along the way}} she finds Gloria's body and Dr. Ryan, barely alive and mumbling in a trance-like state. She also runs into Dr. Allen, who believes Laura committed the killings. He tries to sedate her, but is stopped by the Boogeyman, who stabs him and shoves two needles <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> The Boogeyman is revealed to be Henry; Dr. Allen had locked him in a closet {{in an attempt to}} treat him of his bogyphobia, and the Boogeyman possessed Henry at that time. The chase ends when Laura decapitates the Boogeyman with gardening shears. The police arrive and discover that under the Boogeyman mask was Dr. Ryan; after killing Dr. Allen but prior to chasing Laura, Henry put the mask on the doctor and escaped. Laura realizes that Henry is running free and is arrested for the murder of Dr. Ryan.|$|E

He played on, and his clearing drop-kick almost hit the centre.|$|E

25|$|Parnell was {{selected}} in the ODI and T20 squads for South Africa's tour of Australia in 2008–09, and made his international debut in the second Twenty20 International at Brisbane on 13 January 2009. He was expensive with the ball and put down a crucial catch, but it was later suggested {{that this was the}} result of a green laser light beamed <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> by a member of the crowd. He thus became the youngest player to be handed a national contract by Cricket South Africa (CSA).|$|E
25|$|On the balcony, Belle assures the Beast he'll live {{but they}} both know she is {{helpless}} to save him. She begs him not to leave her because she has found home in his company ("End Duet"), but despite this, he dies; Belle sobs on his body and says she loves him just before the last rose petal falls. A transformation takes place ("Transformation") and the Beast is alive and human once more. Though Belle doesn't recognize {{him for the first}} time, she looks <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and sees the Beast within and they kiss. The two of them sing of how their lives have changed because of love and they dance once more as the company, now changed back to their human form, gathers in the ballroom ("Beauty and the Beast (Reprise)").|$|E
25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E

They [...] "sh the twigs" [...] and interpret what they say. The gods decide that they would find suitable cauldrons at Ægir's home. Thor arrives at Ægir's home and finds him to be cheerful, looks <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and tells him that he must prepare feasts for the gods. Annoyed, Ægir tells Thor that the gods must first bring to him a suitable cauldron to brew ale in. The gods search but find no such cauldron anywhere. However, Týr tells Thor {{that he may have}} a solution; east of Élivágar lives Hymir, and he owns such a deep kettle.|$|E

On the patio, Gerald points the gun into his mouth, as Eddie stumbles around in the lounge area, having accidentally pushed chilli peppers <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> Ray hides under Sabrina's bed as she reenters the room; lying on a sex doll with both breasts and a penis, he is almost discovered. Eddie washes his face, and Gerald starts to play [...] "Without You". Sabrina makes her way downstairs, taking the holdall's key. Sabrina and Gerald dance.|$|E

Another reference comes after Brian is freed, he drinks from a drinking fountain in a defiant manner, {{a reference to the}} 1974 television movie, The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman. Other media references include the Griffins watching the TV show Eight is Enough and Peter writing a letter to Angus MacGyver, from the show MacGyver, asking him to rescue Brian from jail. When Brian puts eye drops <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> before the dog show, he says [...] "Showtime" [...] with jazz hands.

500|$|The tour {{included}} a set at Woodstock '94 broadcast on Pay-per-view and seen {{in as many}} as 24million homes. The band being covered in mud was a result of pre-concert backstage play, contrary to the belief that it was an attention-grabbing ploy, thus making it difficult for Reznor to navigate the stage: Reznor pushed Lohner into the mud pit as the concert began and saw mud from his hair going <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> while performing. Nine Inch Nails was widely proclaimed to have [...] "stolen the show" [...] from its popular contemporaries, mostly classic rock bands, and its fan base expanded. The band received considerable mainstream success thereafter, performing with significantly higher production values and the addition of various theatrical visual elements. Its performance of [...] "Happiness in Slavery" [...] from the Woodstock concert earned the group a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1995. Entertainment Weekly commented about the band's Woodstock '94 performance: [...] "Reznor unstrings rock to its horrifying, melodramatic core--an experience as draining as it is exhilarating". Despite this acclaim, Reznor attributed his dislike of the concert to its technical difficulties.|$|E
500|$|The scenes {{shot at the}} Hospital {{maternity}} {{ward and}} the warehouse were shot at a new studio called [...] "The Coca-Cola Factory" [...] which was formerly a Coke bottling plant. The hospital scenes took 40 days to shoot. The hospital segment's location was chosen since they wanted to have an atypical location where gangs would hide their weapons. While filming in the hospital, the windows were covered with blast shields to {{give the appearance of}} night time, which allowed the crew to film {{at any time during the}} day. Members of the cast and crew stayed in the hospital for days often losing track of the time of day. After long hours of filming in the hospital, the crew became exhausted. This led to having the last scene be one long five-minute scene of action to shorten the time needed to film. To complete this, during the scene when two characters go into an elevator to talk for twenty seconds, the crew changes the scene entirely and sets up the explosions for the scene to continue seamlessly. An accident occurred while filming the hospital sequence. Real glass was used and pieces of it flew toward Tony Leung and got <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> Leung was sent to the hospital and after a week's rest, he returned to the set. Woo changed the ending of Hard Boiled after many members of the crew of the film felt that Leung's character should survive at the film's end.|$|E
500|$|Reeves and Baker {{completed}} {{a third and}} final draft that was [...] "substantially toned down" [...] in content from the previous attempts. This version of the screenplay, which was filmed {{with only a few}} minor revisions during the production, was missing many of the more explicit moments of violence described in the first submitted drafts: the death spasms of the pre-credits hanging victim, Lowes getting stabbed fifteen times with a steel spike, and a sniper's victim somersaulting through the air and slamming into a tree. A sequence depicting the Battle of Naseby was to be filmed, during which a soldier's head was to be cut off on screen. Most significantly, the film's finale was completely altered. In the original ending, Stearne falls in with a group of gypsies and attempts to rape one of their women, who successfully fights off her attacker by plunging her thumbs <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> blinding him. The gypsies then stake him to death. Marshall arrives and convinces the gypsies to assist him in ambushing Hopkins. Hopkins is viciously beaten by Marshall, who forces a [...] "confession" [...] out of the bloodied man. Marshall partially drowns Hopkins (whose thumbs have been tied to his feet), then finally hangs him. Tenser had previously expressed concerns regarding the scope of the Battle of Naseby sequence as well as the gypsy-ending, noting that these would both require the employment of additional groups of extras. He asked Reeves and Baker to remove the battle sequence and simplify the ending for the final draft.|$|E

After the III Corps commander agreed, Khiêm claimed that he wanted to cancel the coup, saying [...] "Đính, I think we still have time to talk to the old man. I don't want to hurt him. Have pity on him!" [...] Đính contemplated the situation and said that he would still proceed with the overthrow. Khiêm reported this to Đôn, and claimed that he had placed Chinese medicinal oil <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to irritate and redden them and thus give the appearance he had become remorseful about the coup, in order to test Đính's loyalty to the plot.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1919, Rheinschild {{was tried}} and {{found not guilty}} of {{complicity}} in an automobile theft; Rheinschild {{had been accused of}} hiding the automobile after it was stolen by another person.
