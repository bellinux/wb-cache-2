Carbon dioxide gave a good quality white light. The first commercial installation was done in 1904 in a hardware store in Newark, New Jersey. The lamp yielded about 10 lumens per watt, which was about triple the output of incandescent lights based on carbon filaments.

30|$|Spectrum sensing for {{cognitive}} radio has {{to cope with}} several impairments like fading, shadowing, and presence of noise. Usually, the noise {{is assumed to be}} white and Gaussian, but in real-life situations, this {{does not need to be}} the case. In particular, one has to consider the presence of impulsive noise, both man-made and natural. Man-made impulsive noise occurs most commonly due to large electrical discharges. The impulses caused by such discharges have typically short duration and may vary in strength and frequency. The sources of the impulses are for instance spark ignition systems of engines, electrical machinery, <b>discharge</b> <b>lighting</b> and so on. The electromagnetic pulses may have durations of 5 to 10 ns and may occur at rates up to several hundred pulses per second [9]. For sake of simplicity, we model the impulsive noise in this paper using Bernoulli-Uniform distribution [10]. It is straightforward to extend the results to other distributions. The required knowledge is the probability that impulse occurs.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that rare earth {{activated}} wide bandgap materials are essential for many applications such as phosphors, lasers and scintillators. One of the more interesting cases is activation by Pr 3 + ions. Usually Pr activation leads to materials showing fast and efficient 4 f 5 d UV emission under ionizing radiation (scintillators) or visible photon cascade under selective VUV excitation (quantum cutting, mercury free <b>discharge</b> <b>lighting</b> phosphors). The cascade emission from Pr 3 + in fluoride hosts (two visible emission photons from a single incident vacuum ultraviolet photon) has been reviewed by Kuck et al[1]. The necessary condition for efficient cascade emission is the presence of the emission originating at 1 S 0 level of the Pr 3 + ion. In this communication we present and discuss time resolved emission and excitation spectra of Ba 0. 8 La 0. 2 F 2. 2 : 0. 2 m%Pr 3 + crystal, which have been measured at SUPERLUMI station of Hasylab in DESY, Hamburg. Although Pr concentration in this crystal is below 0. 3 m % Pr the spectra clearly show the presence of 1 S 0 emission from some low symmetry Pr-sites (we designate it La-site) [2, 3]. This emission is conspicuously absent in Pr-activated BaF 2. Most of the emission from Pr activated (Ba,La) F 2 does, unfortunately, come from regular sites (Ba-site) that do not support an efficient cascade emission (see Fig. 1).

The glass characterization included measurements of the viscosity and thermal expansion of the glasses, as well as the thermal expansion of the partly crystalline glass ceramics. In addition, the wetting and sintering behavior of all glasses has been measured, as well as the crystallization behavior. The time and temperature at which crystalline phases form from the glasses has been determined for all of the glasses.

The new glass composition showed lower bulk electrical conductivity, excellent sealing and wetting behavior when sealing under applied load, and qualitatively superior performance when exposed to wet hydrogen for 800 hours. Traditional melting was used to prepare all of the glasses that were studied in detail.

Current discharge lamps - emitting mainly atomic radiation - are reaching only about half of the theoretical efficacy limit of 200 - 230 lm/W. The possible efficacy rise by increasing atomic radiation is limited by self-absorption of the atomic lines (= radiation trapping).
