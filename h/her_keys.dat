25|$|Archie has {{frequent}} {{reason to}} note that he needs at least eight hours' sleep each night, and prefers more. He reacts bitterly when his sleep is interrupted or otherwise shortened by events, such as late-night interrogations at Homicide headquarters or a precinct, or a 1:45a.m. {{phone call from a}} client who has lost <b>her</b> <b>keys,</b> or driving a suspect to her home in Carmel and returning to Manhattan at 2:30a.m.|$|E
25|$|Vicarious {{liability}} for theft {{has also been}} found due to poor selections of employees by an employer, as in Nahhas v Pier House Management. Here, the management company of a luxury block of flats employed a porter, who was an 'ex-professional thief', to manage their building. A tenant of the building entrusted him with <b>her</b> <b>keys,</b> and was subsequently robbed of expensive jewellery. The management company {{were found to have}} been negligent in hiring the porter, having not carried out sufficient checks on his background, address, or obtaining a written reference. It has been stated it is unlikely that as a general rule, where there are proper checks and systems to prevent such incidents, liability would be found; it is in the interests of society to allow rehabilitation of offenders.|$|E
500|$|Reardon and Yeates' friends set up {{a website}} and used social {{networking}} services to help look for her. On 21 December 2010, Yeates' parents and Reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference. In another press conference, broadcast live on 23 December 2010 by Sky News and BBC News, Yeates' father David commented on her disappearance: [...] "I think she was abducted after getting home to her flat ... I {{have no idea of}} the circumstances of the abduction because of what was left behind ... I feel sure she would not have gone out by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere". <b>Her</b> <b>keys,</b> phone, purse and coat were left behind at her flat. Detectives retrieved a receipt for a pizza, but found no sign of it or of its packaging. Both bottles of cider were found in the flat, one of them partially consumed. As {{there was no evidence of}} forced entry or a struggle, investigators began to examine the possibility that Yeates may have known her abductor.|$|E

2500|$|Rose {{suspects}} {{that she is}} living {{in one of the}} buildings and writes to her brother Mark (Leigh McCloskey), a music student in Rome, urging him to visit her.

Rose manages to get away, but is being watched.|$|E
2500|$|St Mirren {{have the}} {{distinction}} of being the only club ever to sack Ferguson. He claimed wrongful dismissal against the club at an industrial tribunal but lost and was given no leave to appeal. According to a Billy Adams Sunday Herald article on 30 May 1999, the official version is that Ferguson was sacked for various breaches of contract including unauthorised payments to players. He was counter-accused of intimidating behaviour towards his office secretary because he wanted players to get some expenses tax free. He did not speak to her for six weeks, confiscated <b>her</b> <b>keys</b> and communicated only through a 17-year-old assistant. The tribunal concluded that Ferguson was [...] "particularly petty" [...] and [...] "immature". It was claimed during the tribunal by St Mirren chairman, Willie Todd, that Ferguson had [...] "no managerial ability".|$|E
