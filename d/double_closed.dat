50|$|According to Kivimäki himself, {{his work}} with the Russian foreign {{ministry}} was similar to {{his work with}} other ministries and that the diplomats he worked with were not spies. His work for the Russian foreign ministry consisted of short studies that explored research-based support for example for Russian diplomatic arguments against militaristic counter-terrorism of the United States and its allies (including Denmark) and military interventions in Iraq, and the potential intervention in Iran. Kivimäki had refused to help Russians in their arguments of {{their position in the}} negotiation on the territorial disputes in the Arctic. However, Kivimäki offered to organize scholarly seminars on the topic in order to help the initiation of political negotiation on the topic (Kai Byman: “Rauhanmies Häpeäpaalussa”,YLE documentary, September 27, 2012). The Court in Glostrup, Denmark, concluded in its public version of the verdict, after a hearing that was secret not only to the public, but, in part, also to the defendant (<b>double</b> <b>closed</b> doors hearings), that the Russians Dr. Kivimäki had collaborated with were diplomats (rather than spies), but that information that Kivimäki delivered in his discussions with these diplomats, if passed to the Russien intelligence organization, could have helped the intelligence organization. Thus the court convicted Kivimäki under the paragraph 108 of the Danish criminal code (public version). Kivimäki was not charged for delivering secrets to Russians (article 107). He served his 2 ½ years home arrest in autumn 2012. His sentence was controversial and for example the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland said in an interview to the biggest Newspaper in Finland (Helsingin Sanomat 13.4. 2012) that Kivimäki’s activities would not have given rise to legal proceedings in Finland, and that the Foreign Minister could not see with certainty that Prof. Kivimäki’s legal rights were protected in Denmark.|$|E

Based on {{the dynamic}} {{mathematical}} model of three-phase grid-connected inverter, {{two kinds of}} control strategies are compared, one is <b>double</b> <b>closed</b> loop control based on grid voltage orientation theory, the other is direct power control. According to the mathematical model of two-phase rotating coordinates of the inverter, in <b>double</b> <b>closed</b> loop control theory, the purpose of control of the inverter by decoupling control and PI control is achieved. From the point of energy on direct power control system, the active, inactive power of output AC of inverter are calculated,and suitable space voltage vector was selected after comparing with the given values to realize the direct control of the power set point. The basic theory of two control strategies and implementation method are included, and the simulation model was established based on MATLAB/Simulink. And their simulation results, characteristics of two kinds of control methods were compared through simulation data analysis.

40|$|A novel {{position}} control strategy for a Brushless DC motor (BLDC) drive is proposed in this paper. Brushless DC motor, which {{is widely used}} {{in the field of}} Direct Drive servo Actuator (DDA) with superior performance, possesses fast transient response and high accuracy. Nevertheless, there are such uncertainties as unpredictable flow torques and estimated errors of the BLDC model in this system, which may influence the accuracy and the rapid response of the control. So in this paper, genetic algorithm is applied to the position loop. Simultaneously, in order to improve the rapidness of the whole system, position and velocity double closed-loop system is compared with position and current double closed-loop system. Experimental results validate the scheme proposed can attenuate the influences by the uncertainties of the model sharply. The genetic algorithm used in the position loop can ensure the system's stability and the accuracy of the position response. While tracking the same step response the step rise time of the <b>double</b> <b>closed</b> loop structure of the position and current reduced more than 25 % compared with that of the <b>double</b> <b>closed</b> loop structure of the position and velocity...|$|E
