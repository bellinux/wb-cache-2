500|$|The trio {{released}} two 7-inch EP recordings with Cargo {{during the}} interim. By {{the summer of}} 1996, [...] "Wasting Time" [...] had been released as a single to keep matters moving along nattily. The track was the final single from the Cheshire Cat sessions, and the band would soon return to their native home state to record a follow-up. Before recording of the album began, the band booked time at DML Studios in Escondido, California, where they perfected the songs for Dude Ranch. Most of the lyrics for the album had been written over 1995 and 1996, while touring. [...] "I remember writing most of those songs <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> sitting on a [...] curb, whatever," [...] recalled DeLonge in 2001. [...] "Back then, each song was pretty much written with a specific girl or event in mind." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and choreographed by Jeri Slaugher. After seeing a trailer of Barber's film project, Idlewild, Aguilera {{wanted to make a}} video directed by him, explained: [...] "It intrigued me that this man, Bryan Barber, had been very locked into and had surrounded himself with this whole world of the '20s and '30s era, and it made me think that he could understand what I'm trying to do conceptually. I needed to get the right director who shared my vision". At first Aguilera planned to make a black-and-white video and shot it in her living room for Barber and Slaugher. [...] "I had acted out the entire video <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> I used my fireplace as a makeshift stage and the staircase as the pool table where I would stand", said Aguilera. According to Barber, Aguilera was very involved in the making of the videot. The whole team seemed like they were doing a movie more than a music video. On June 21, 2006, the music video for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] was premiered on MTV's Total Request Live.|$|E
500|$|A {{recording}} made at Carfax Tower in Oxford {{provided the}} bell chimes heard {{at the end}} of [...] "Strange Ones". These chimes were only heard on the I Should Coco version, not on Supergrass is 10, because on the I Should Coco album the chimes are used as a transition to the next track, [...] "Sitting Up Straight", which was not included in Supergrass is 10. [...] "Strange Ones" [...] was written about Cowley Road, Oxford, a place where the band once lived. It was originally intended to be the [...] "throwaway song" [...] on the B-side to [...] "Caught by the Fuzz". Another song on the album with the same theme, [...] "I'd Like To Know", was inspired by listening to [...] "Strange Ones" [...] played backwards on tape cassette. Supergrass took this sound, wrote new lyrics for it, and had another song for their album. Gaz Coombes says, [...] "One of the highlights of this album was recording 'Sofa (Of My Lethargy)'.... I remember everybody got in the live room and had an instrument, including Sam [...] on bass, a friend of his on hammond organ and we played the rest, all live, one take.... We made I Should Coco so fast because we wanted to catch the energy and excitement of the songs on tape, and do it before the money ran out!" [...] In a 2005 interview with BBC Radio London Quinn remembered [...] "writing that song [...] <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> on a rainy day and Gaz sort of turned up with this chord sequence and we just went straight through it and just did it on 4 track".|$|E

5000|$|Though {{a lifelong}} actor, Stanley Bennett Clay has stated he prefers {{directing}} and producing: [...] "I've {{always been the}} one in charge. I like the responsibility. At 12, I produced my first show: wrote it, composed the music, directed it, sold tickets, controlled the concessions—lemonade and cookies—and starred <b>in</b> it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> parents' <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> People from the neighborhood lined up to see it. Yeah, it's about control. I'm doing my own things, doing them the way I want them done." ...|$|R
5000|$|That night, the fright totally disappeared. [...] "The minute I got up {{on stage}} I had this feeling like I'd been {{preparing}} for this all my life. I was so relaxed that I felt as though I was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Chick and I played musical games - he'd play these real simple lines and I'd be giving my interpretations of them, then go off into the Chick Corea 'outness.' I ended up in New York two weeks later."With keyboardist and composer Chick Corea’s pioneering fusion group that featured bassist Stanley Clarke and drummer Lenny White, Connors established himself on the national and international music scenes, touring in Japan and Europe, and recording the now legendary Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy.|$|R
2500|$|Tré Cool's {{father was}} {{supportive}} and overhauled a bookmobile {{to transport the}} band. He would later say: [...] "I watched them go from {{a bunch of kids}} to a group of musicians with work ethic," [...] also adding: [...] "On their first tour or two, {{it was more of a}} party than anything else. I still scratch my head and say, 'How in the hell did they make it?' They used to practice <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> here – a lot of the songs they did on Dookie. You hear it coming together, and you don't expect people are going to go out and buy it. But when it does, you just say, 'Wow that's so cool.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Wolverine {{was tough}} for Jackman to portray {{because he had}} few lines, {{but a lot of}} emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies and Mel Gibson in Road Warrior. [...] "Here were guys who had {{relatively}} little dialogue, like Wolverine had, but you knew and felt everything. I'm not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it." [...] Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. [...] "We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, 'Don't give me long, choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don't make the fights pretty." [...] Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine's claws. [...] "Every day <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> I'd just walk around with those claws, to get used to them. I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned." ...|$|E

60|$|Under the {{influence}} of Spencer I traced a parallel development of the Arts and found a measure of scientific peace. Under the inspiration of Whitman I pondered the significance of democracy and caught some part of its spiritual import. With Henry George as guide, I discovered {{the main cause of}} poverty and suffering in the world, and so <b>in</b> <b>my</b> little <b>room,</b> <b>living</b> on forty cents a day, I was in a sense profoundly happy.

5000|$|The {{song was}} written by Tim Nichols and Craig Wiseman. The duo {{had a friend who}} {{received}} a medical misdiagnosis regarding a form of lung cancer. Wiseman and Nichols began discussing family members and friends who learned of illnesses, and how they often had a new perspective on life upon learning they had limited time. They decided to write a song based on the concept, hoping that it might inspire someone in such a situation. After they came up with the title, they began writing the first verse and chorus. They found themselves attached to the song, and continued to write in late into the night over the phone. [...] "I remember going <b>in</b> <b>my</b> totally dark <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> laying on the floor, and we wrote the second verse on the phone," [...] Wiseman recalled. The inclusion of the lyric about riding a bull was intended as a sort of [...] "palette cleanse," [...] as they felt the chorus was growing too sentimental. The duo judged its creation as a [...] "really spiritual thing, because it came strong. Me and Tim's instincts and intuitions just kept leading us." ...|$|R
2500|$|Buckley's {{premature}} death inspired many artists he knew or influenced to write songs {{in tribute to}} the late singer. PJ Harvey knew him personally and in the song [...] "Memphis" [...] she takes lines from a song on his unfinished album, [...] "Morning Theft", and {{in her own words}} reflects on Buckley's death: [...] "In Memphis...die suddenly, at a wonderful age, we're ready to go". Chris Cornell wrote [...] "Wave Goodbye", which appeared on his first solo album, Euphoria Morning, for Buckley. Rufus Wainwright, whose fledgling career had barely started when he met Buckley, wrote [...] "Memphis Skyline" [...] in tribute to him, singing [...] "then came hallelujah sounding like Ophelia, for me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>living,</b> turn back and you will stay, under the Memphis Skyline". Duncan Sheik's [...] "A Body Goes Down", from his 1998 album Humming, was a response to Buckley's death. Steve Adey wrote a song tribute entitled [...] "Mississippi" [...] on his 2006 album All Things Real. The song contains the lyrics [...] "Until the morning thief steals the humming of the Lord", a reference to Buckley's song [...] "Morning Theft".|$|R
