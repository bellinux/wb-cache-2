25|$|Karel Kaers, the {{youngest}} man {{to win the}} world road championship, also won the Ronde in 1939– without intending to. For him, it was training for Paris–Roubaix. He drove to the Kwaremont hill near Kluisbergen, parked his car, then rode 40km to the start in Ghent. His plan was to ride round the course with his usual training partner, stop when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> car, then drive home. Knowing he wasn't riding the whole distance, Kaers jumped clear of the field– again as training– and rode up the Kwaremont with a minute's lead. But his car wasn't there. He pressed on instead and won the race. His manager had driven the car away to save Kaers from temptation.|$|E

500|$|Sitting on {{the bench}} as the game entered the final minute of play, Henderson [...] "had a feeling" [...] that he could score. [...] He {{convinced}} coach Sinden to send him out when Peter Mahovlich left the ice. Rushing into the Soviet zone, Henderson missed a pass from Yvan Cournoyer {{in front of the}} net and was tripped by a Soviet defenceman. [...] As <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet, Phil Esposito recovered the puck and sent it towards Henderson in front of the net. The first shot was stopped by Vladislav Tretiak, but Henderson recovered the rebound and slid it past the fallen goaltender to give Canada a 6–5 lead with only 34 seconds left to play. [...] It was his seventh goal of the tournament, tying him for the series lead with Esposito and Alexander Yakushev. The goal won the game, and the series, for Canada. [...] The team returned home to massive crowds in Montreal and Toronto, and Paul Henderson had become a national hero.|$|E
