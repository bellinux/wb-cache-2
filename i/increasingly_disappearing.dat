40|$|The earlier {{distinct}} fertility regimes, “developed ” and “developing ” are <b>increasingly</b> <b>disappearing</b> {{in global}} comparisons of fertility levels [...] - convergence towards low fertility (Bongaarts and Bulatao 2000; Lutz et al. 2001; Wilson 2001). The spread of below-replacement fertility to formerly high fertility countries has {{occurred at a}} remarkably rapid pace. A global convergence of fertility indicators that has been quicker than the convergence of many other socio-economic characteristics was (Billari and Kohler, 2002). Fertility levels may not naturally stabilize close to replacement level as earlier notion suggested, they may continue and follow the course declining to below 1. 3. The new aspect of current low and lowest-low fertility patterns is that the postponement of childbearing – particularly for the first births – {{has emerged as a}} crucial determinant of differences in fertility levels among developed countries (Billari and Kohler, 2002).

40|$|The {{modern world}} has been {{transformed}} by globalisation and national boundaries are <b>increasingly</b> <b>disappearing.</b> There are institutional elements resembling a world government: the United Nations; World Banking Institutions: the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund; and international courts: the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. Also, interestingly, international legal personality is expanding. Over the years, it has expanded to include non-state actors such as intergovernmental organisations and individuals. Multinational corporations (MNCs) are recognised as major actors in the globalisation process. However, the international regulatory agenda has not paid sufficient attention to MNCs. Their regulation has remained largely confined to the domestic forums. The inability of domestic law {{to grapple with the}} concept of MNCs and the failure at international law to deal effectively with it have led to regulatory gaps. Three major areas of impact of MNCs' activities have attracted attention in recent times, albeit from different perspectives. The first is in respect of issues relating to the human rights accountability of MNCs, the second is in relation to the concept of corporate social responsibility and the third is in respect of systemic risks in international financial transactions posed by the operations of MNCs. This article posits that these issues are a product of the same development: the globalisation of domestic corporations and the absence of an appropriate regulatory framework to deal with MNCs international operations. This article argues that the solution lies in establishing the locus for the international regulation of the company as a method of doing business. This will involve developing the concept of the international company (IC) with an international corporate personality (analogous to corporate personality under domestic law) under an international company law framework to fill the regulatory gaps. This approach will facilitate the effective regulation of MNCs...|$|E

40|$|Even {{though the}} {{phenomenon}} of refugees {{has changed over the}} course of recent decades, asylum remains an important issue for states all over the world. Whilst two-thirds of refugees live in developing countries, Western countries arguably have a special obligation due to their own value orientation. Thus, a common asylum policy looms large for the European Union (EU) for at least two reasons. Firstly, it has to ensure the maintenance of human rights within its territory and achieve common standards to avoid secondary refugee movements. Secondly, as the EU’s internal borders are <b>increasingly</b> <b>disappearing,</b> an adequate management of external borders becomes a common priority but requires burden-sharing among the Member States (MS). In the first instance, the EU has drawn up various directives which oblige Member States to adopt minimum standards in the area of asylum. National policies and practices should be in line with those standards so as to promote the second phase of a Common European Asylum System (CEAS). The authors aim to seek suggestions on how Member States’ practices and policies can strengthen the CEAS by complying and rising above the minimum standards and thus improving the protection of human rights for asylum seekers. Whilst seeking better practices and policies the authors use examples from the current situation in the Netherlands and Greece. The paper is divided into four sections. The first section provides some background information on the international legislation which {{can be seen as a}} framework of the EU policies. The second looks into the need for European refugee protection and focuses on the concept of the CEAS. It introduces the main legislative instruments in the asylum process and discusses future possibilities. The third section examines examples of Dutch policies and practices in relation to the minimum standards instruments. In this framework, 'good' and 'less good' practices as well as problems with the application of the EU minimum standards will be highlighted. Additionally, the influence of human rights will be examined, thus demonstrating that the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) is also important for asylum seekers' policies and practices. The last section of the paper provides some policy recommendations and gives a summary of practices which may apply in asylum cases...|$|E
40|$|At {{the dawn}} of the new millennium, {{globalisation}} has become the most popular agenda in the economic, political and social lives of individuals, firms and nations. When we think about globalisation, we think of the remarkable convergence of tastes in consumer goods and the pervasive culture of consumption sweeping the world. We also think of webs of information, resources, people and products; electronically woven through networks of firms spread all over the globe. We think of the political and economic transformations changing the very structures and strategies of firms, and new manifestations of resources, such as knowledge and information, replacing traditional factors of production, such as land, labour and capital. We also think of the nation-state, an institution embraced by mankind in the last two centuries, giving way to the global corporation, the economic transformation agent of the new century, leapfrogging firms and peoples, including those from the developing world, into market prosperity. We think of this corporation, an economic value chain loosely managed by knowledge and information webs, as perhaps the most precious productive resource known to mankind (1; 94; 95). There has been a sea change in the world economy, with perceived far-reaching consequences on all aspects of human civilisation (75). We are moving progressively further away from a world in which national economies were relatively isolated from each other by barriers to cross-border trade and investment; by distance, time zones and language; and by national differences in government regulation, culture and business systems. We are moving towards a world in which national economies are merging into an interdependent global economic system, commonly referred to as globalisation (43). The transformation now taking place in the global economy is unprecedented. The increasing availability of global capital, coupled with advances in computing and communications technology, is serving to speed up the processes of globalisation. Concurrently, the barriers to globalisation are <b>increasingly</b> <b>disappearing</b> in most countries of the world (22). Meanwhile, globalisation has accelerated the process of increasing interconnectedness between societies, so much so that events {{in one part of the}} world have more and more effect on peoples and societies far away. In other words, a globalised world is one in which political, economic, cultural and social events become more and more interconnected, and also one iri which they have a wider impact (11). In this research article, an attempt is made to provide a conceptual analysis of globalisation from both historical and contemporary perspectives. Explanation is provided in terms of why firms are motivated to go global. Finally, implications emerging from the globalisation of multinational enterprises, in terms of formulating corporate strategy, are explored...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{a sea change in}} the world economy, with {{perceived}} far-reaching consequences on all aspects of human civilisation. This dramatic transformation is largely precipitated by the phenomenon of globalisation. The transformation now taking place in the global economy is unprecedented. The increasing availability of global capital, coupled with advances in computing and communications technology, is serving to speed up the processes of globalisation. Concurrently, the barriers to globalisation are <b>increasingly</b> <b>disappearing</b> in most countries of the world (11). As a consequence, the word 'globalization' is in daily use throughout the world: mondialisation in France, Globalisierung in Germany and Quan qui hua in China. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) and entrepreneurs alike are increasingly capitalising on unprecedented business opportunities around the world which are spawned due to globalisation of national economies. With that in mind, MNEs and entrepreneurs need to exercise due diligence in conducting their businesses in a socially and ethically responsible manner internationally, as unethical business practices are not going to helpful to the sustainability of business enterprises strategically. Ethical behaviour of businesses has become a major issue throughout the world; when a business behaves unethically it is widely publicised by the media to concerned citizens. Examples of unethical business behaviour that are widely condemned include poor working conditions; low wages; enforced overtime; harsh, sometimes brutal, discipline and corporal punishment; bribery; patent or copyright infringements; lying and deceit about product performance and safety; deliberate use of harmful substances; intentional environmental pollution; discrimination; and violation of promises. Enron {{is a prime example of}} a multinational with serious ethical dilemmas. It has been dubbed 'one of the worst corporate frauds in history'. But how did they get away with it for so long? In part, flaws in the American legal system are to blame. Enron had the means to audit its own information and its own pension funds, and the opportunity to employ its own auditors/accountants. Personal greed and the need for power were also to blame. Executives covered their tracks by cooking the books and by acquiring many firms, in order to make it seem like the company was booming. But could it have been prevented? Prior unethical behaviour within the firm was uncovered after the bankruptcy. White-collar crimes were not harshly punished in those days, and didn't serve as a deterrent for unethical behaviour (73; 74). In this research article, an examination is made of ethical practices and propensities across nations that have considerable implications for MNEs and global entrepreneurs. The world is becoming more and more interdependent due to the increasing globalisation of world economy, mass migration, tourism and worldwide application of information technology, coupled with increasing regional and worldwide cooperation. Thus, MNEs, including entrepreneurs, are now operating within different socio-cultural environments involving people of culturally diverse backgrounds. This can also give rise to many ethical problems facing MNEs and global entrepreneurs and international firms operating in different countries. Some ethical dilemmas may include bribery, deceit/false information, anti-competitive behaviour, discrimination, environmental issues and social responsibility...|$|E

30|$|Robotics {{is being}} taught in over 35, 000 formal and {{informal}} education settings in the USA (FIRST 2013; REC 2013) {{and a number of}} educators and researchers have highlighted the potential use of robotics lessons to reinforce students’ mathematical understanding (Benitti 2012; Vollstedt et al. 2007). One popular premise for doing so is that {{students are more likely to}} recognize the math as relevant because of its direct, applicable utility to a concrete and contextualized task (Doppelt et al. 2008; Mubin et al. 2013). This instructional approach of teaching mathematics within the context of robotics is commonly referred to as robot math. Robot math’s cross-disciplinary integration of engineering, technology, and mathematics highlights for students how these different disciplines necessitate and facilitate each other. Such instruction stands in contrast to more traditional mathematics classes, which might prompt mathematical reasoning only for the sake of understanding numerical relationships, and merely describe it as occurring in a context. Although the current paper focuses exclusively on robot math, such integrated activity-based instructional approaches might be appropriate for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education more broadly as the lines between these disciplines <b>increasingly</b> <b>disappear.</b>|$|R
40|$|Classic {{constitutional}} thought {{considered the}} power to conclude international treaties to fall within the executive's exclusive domain. But this nineteenth-century logic hardly convinces in the twenty-first century. For the function of international treaties has dramatically shifted from the military to the regulatory domain; and {{in the wake of}} this ‘new internationalism’, the traditional divide between ‘internal’ and ‘external’ affairs has <b>increasingly</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Has this enlarged scope of the treaty power also triggered a transformation of its nature; and in particular: has the rise of ‘legislative’ international treaties been compensated by a greater role accorded to parliaments? This article explores this question comparatively by looking at the constitutional law of the United States and the European Union. Within the United States, international treaties were traditionally concluded under a procedure that excluded the House of Representatives; yet with the rise of the Congressional-Executive-Agreement in the twentieth century, this democratic deficit has been partially remedied. We find a similar evolution {{within the context of the}} European Union, where an increasing ‘parliamentarisation’ of the treaty power has taken place.

30|$|Curiously, and in {{contrast}} to what the ‘multiculturalism is dead’ rhetoric suggests, these policies have been increasingly implemented in many Western countries (Kymlicka, 2012). Moreover, some of the countries proclaiming {{the idea of a}} ‘failed multiculturalism’ had never implemented multicultural policies in the first place. Some scholars have therefore argued that the open hostility to multiculturalism is [for some] an exercise in avoiding the term ‘multiculturalism’ rather than a real retreat from its principles (McGhee, 2008). Vertovec & Wessendorf (2010 a, p. 18) contend that even if the word multiculturalism may have <b>increasingly</b> <b>disappeared</b> from political rhetoric, this has not led to the ‘eradication, or even the detriment, of actual measures, institutions, and frameworks of minority cultural recognition’. If multiculturalist policies are indeed still being implemented in most Western countries, it has been alongside new civic integration policies which (1) focus on the role of employment in integration; (2) expect newcomers to respect basic liberal-democratic values; and (3) emphasize basic knowledge of the host society’s language, history and institutions (Kymlicka, 2012). While Joppke (2004) argues that the emergence of these policies is an indication of how under threat multiculturalism is, Kymlicka maintains that both policy types can be implemented simultaneously. According to Levrau & Loobuyck (2013 b); see also Loobuyck (2016) it is even possible to consider civic integration policies as a part of multiculturalism and interculturalism.|$|R
40|$|In Western Europe {{the fate}} of {{biodiversity}} is intimately linked to agricultural land use. A driving force behind biodiversity decline is the gradual conversion of Europe’s traditional integrated rural landscapes of nature and agriculture into monofunctional units of production. With these developments, semi-natural landscape elements have <b>increasingly</b> <b>disappeared</b> from agricultural landscapes. A growing body of research, however, underlines the importance of semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes for biodiversity conservation, habitat connectivity, and ecosystem services. On the local scale, considerable variation between the relative area of landscape elements on individual farms can be observed. Farm management decisions are presumed to be important determinants for the composition of agricultural landscapes and the services provided to society.   By bringing together data from farmer interviews and aerial photographic imagery, this paper analyzes the predictive validity of farm management characteristics to understand the distribution of landscape elements on farmland parcels. The farm management parameters {{included in the study}} are relevant to current dominant trends in the Dutch agricultural sector; intensification, scale enlargement, diversification, and gradual termination of farming activities. Scale enlargement and migratory processes are found to be important predictors. The results of the Dutch case study provide insights in the threats and opportunities for the conservation of semi-natural habitat in agricultural landscapes. The findings present an empirical contribution to the debate on sustainable management of agriculture’s green infrastructure and, in broader perspective, the objective to reconcile agricultural production with the urging need of biodiversity conservation in Europe’s spatially contested countryside...|$|R

40|$|The {{argument}} {{presented in}} this paper is that during the Shoah the Nazis were attempting to further enforce the understanding that humanity is essentially self-destructive or superfluous. Several writings are examined more closely to support this argument: Emil Fackenheim's To Mend the World: Foundations of Future Jewish Thought (section IV), Hannah Arendt's The Origins of Totalitarianism (Part 3) and, finally, Giorgio Agamben's "Homo Sacer": Bare Life and Sovereign Power (Part 3). Each of these author's writings are used as a focus {{for a discussion of the}} self-destructive tendencies that are a part of Nazism in its relationship to: Law, the Idea of Man and Ideology. An effort is made during the discussion of these topics to arrive at an appreciation of the extremely alarming extent to which the Nazis had enforced the creation of a society that was wholly self-destructive. This argument concerning the Nazi understanding of humanity also recognizes the creation of a society that is wholly self-destructive as an underlying threat that continues to pose an ongoing danger to the post-Shoah world. The recognition of this threat unfortunately demonstrates the relevance of the Nazi understanding of humanity to this world (a relevance which at the outset may not have been apparent). Amongst the challenges this poses is that as the creation of a wholly self-destructive society further intensifies the possibility for philosophy <b>increasingly</b> <b>disappears.</b> In the concluding chapter, reference is again made to the writings of Fackenheim, Arendt and Agamben.

Also included in this discussion is the importance of this type of resistance to the possibility for philosophy in this world. Thesis (M. A.) [...] University of Ottawa (Canada), 2006.

40|$|Deltas are {{of great}} {{importance}} to humans all over the world. They are densely populated coastal areas, where land arises from sea. An amazing gradient where two worlds meet and nature and humans proliferate traditionally. Yet this gradient <b>increasingly</b> <b>disappears</b> due to the great technical advances since the 19 th century, which tried to control the marine dynamics of deltas to ensure safety of the hinterland against inundation. The Deltaworks in the Netherlands embody this. The masterpiece of the Deltaworks meant {{the construction of a}} national icon: the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier, which does not only withstand storm surges, but even daily controls the tides of the sea in the Eastern Scheldt. However, this permeable dam has resulted in the erosion of the intertidal area and subsequently in an insatiable demand of sand, which increases annually due to sea-level rise. The intertidal area will have disappeared in about 2080 as a consequence of this sand hunger, with major social - and ecological problems as a result. Besides sand hunger, Zeeland also suffers from space hunger. The rise of mass recreation in the past century has led to the cluttering of holiday parks in the hinterland of the delta, which destroy the lowlands and the delta in their vastness. Therefore, a holistic solution for the Zeeland delta does not only secure the intertidal area, but also encompasses the finding of a suitable place for recreation in its delta. This is achieved by means of the deconstruction of the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier and Grevelingendam, and using the resulting new marine dynamics to promote the social - and ecological situation of the Eastern Scheldt. The new multifunctional coastal defense systems protect the hinterland from inundation permanently and is in itself a new landscape entity of Zeeland in which the function of recreation becomes integrated into the landscape. This way Zeeland is strengthened integrally between sea and land and the Eastern Scheldt is transformed from a nature - to a human reserve, where all interactions live together as an obviousness.

It seems that in contemporary reality an affiliation of an individual to a subcultural group – {{in the context of the}} possibility of obtaining social success - is excessive. A person who consistently identifies with oriented resistance, rebellion, or creates an alternative world group is in practice excluded from mainstream culture and career. It is true that modern society seems to tolerate almost any difference, but it is by no means so-called “cold tolerance”. The marginalization of persons belonging to the subculture is done by silent mechanisms of ignorance. At the same time belonging to a subculture usually requires the reconstruction of one’s own identity, including the stringent requirements of the group, both in terms of value systems and everyday lifestyles. It is not difficult to notice that in contemporary world lifelong relationships and coalitions, “brotherhood of arms” and close ties <b>disappear</b> <b>increasingly.</b> They are replaced by sometimes ad-hoc configurations of tribal character, directed to fight with another tribe, created in the same way, or to the implementation of a specific “interest”.
