5|$|The {{concert hall}} {{had its own}} {{in-house}} orchestra by November, and ticket sales for concerts accounted for 43% of the pier's revenue by 1920. The West Pier was favoured by locals, while the Palace Pier was used more by <b>day</b> <b>trippers.</b> A top-deck entrance {{was added to the}} hall in 1932. The pier's central decking was removed during World War II to prevent enemy landings, and its popularity began to decline. On 26 November 1944 a Royal Air Force Hawker Typhoon fighter hit the pier, crashing onto the beach. The pilot sustained head injuries. The Typhoon was one of four aircraft escorting a VIP flight.|$|E
5|$|To allow steamers {{to bring}} <b>day</b> <b>trippers</b> to Weston-super-Mare from ports {{on both the}} English and Welsh side of the Bristol Channel, a landing jetty was {{extended}} {{on the west side}} of the island. The Severn Estuary has the second highest tidal range in the world second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its tidal range, and the underlying geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The tidal range means that the legs of the pier are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at high tide.|$|E

5|$|Tourism {{has grown}} in Dorset since the late 18th century {{and is now the}} {{predominant}} industry. It is estimated that 37,500 people work in Dorset's tourism sector. Some 3.2million British and 326,000 foreign tourists visited the county in 2008, staying a total of 15.1 million nights. In addition there were 14.6million day visitors. The combined spending of both groups was £1,458million. Towns received 56% of Dorset's <b>day</b> <b>trippers,</b> 27% went to the coast and 17% to the countryside. A survey carried out in 1997 concluded that the primary reason tourists were drawn to Dorset was the attractiveness of the county's coast and countryside. Numbers of domestic and foreign tourists have fluctuated in recent years due to various factors including security and economic downturn, a trend reflected throughout the UK.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of Manor Farm {{and the local}} woods from redevelopment was eventually confirmed in January 1930, after a visit {{by a member of}} the Royal Society of Arts to choose buildings that should be conserved. The Great Barn and Little Barn were selected, along with the old Post Office, the Old Bell public house and the Priest's House of the local church. The woods, part of the centre of the manor of Ruislip along with Ruislip village square, were included when King's College sold the land to the district in February 1931. Park Wood was sold for £28,100 with Manor Farm and the old Post Office included as a gift to the people of Ruislip. King's had wished to also present the wood as a gift but was required by the University and College's Act to receive payment as it was the trustee of the land. Middlesex County Council contributed 75% of the cost as the urban district council argued that many of those who would make use of the land would be recreational <b>day</b> <b>trippers</b> from outside the district. Under a 999-year lease, the council agreed to maintain the wood and ensure no new buildings were constructed without the permission of the county council. An area of the wood to the south was not included in the lease agreement and three residential roads were later constructed on it.|$|E

25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the railway {{connection}} to the Welsh valleys in 1878 came the regular influx of <b>day</b> <b>trippers,</b> often hundreds of them at weekends and bank holidays. The developing summer holiday trade was supported by a large number of quality hotels that provided nearly two thousand bedspaces. The biggest and grandest of the hotels were the Esplanade Hotel on the seafront built in 1887, The Marine Hotel {{at the mouth of the}} docks, The Royal Hotel at the top of Arcot Street, The Washington Hotel opposite the library and The Glendale and Lansdowne hotels on Plymouth Road. Apart from the major hotels, accommodation was also available at the smaller Dock Hotel, Penarth Hotel, Ship Hotel, Westbourne Hotel, Plymouth Hotel, Windsor Hotel, Railway Hotel and dozens of mariners' lodging houses at the top end of the town. All have now closed with the exception of the Glendale and a handful of small and more recent bed and breakfast establishments.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Day</b> <b>Tripper,</b> a {{recreational}} kayak {{was introduced by}} Jackson Kayaks in 2007.

Its design feature radically differentiated the <b>Day</b> <b>Tripper</b> from other recreational kayaks. This lead the way to further collaboration with professional kayak fishermen and the development of three more fishing kayak models namely the Coosa, Cuda and Big Tuna.|$|R

25|$|The major {{economic}} {{activity in the}} parish is agriculture and the parish encompasses several large farms. Most agriculture centres around dairying, with arable crops such as potato and cauliflower being farmed {{as well as some}} raising of pigs and sheep. As with much of Cornwall, fishing is an important source of income and employment. Many smaller crabbers and landline fishermen operate from the various coves and harbours on the rocky shore. Before its closure {{at the turn of the}} millennium the transatlantic telephone cable station, and telecommunications educational facility, run by Cable and Wireless at Porthcurno provided further employment opportunities in the neighbouring parish of St Levan. Its central location in west Penwith and proximity to popular tourist attractions such as the Minack Theatre, Land's End and the Blue Flag beach at Sennen Cove, mean that St Buryan enjoys a healthy income from visitors, both <b>day</b> <b>trippers</b> and those renting accommodation, during the summer months.|$|E
500|$|Many {{disasters}} have befallen {{the residents}} of the East End, both in war and in peace. In particular, as a maritime port, plague and pestilence have disproportionately fallen on {{the residents of}} the East End. The area most afflicted by the Great Plague (1665) was Spitalfields, and cholera epidemics broke out in Limehouse in 1832 and struck again in 1848 and 1854. Typhus and tuberculosis were also common in the crowded 19th century tenements. The [...] was a passenger steamer crowded with <b>day</b> <b>trippers</b> returning from Gravesend to Woolwich and London Bridge. On the evening of 3 September 1878, she collided with the steam collier Bywell Castle (named for Bywell Castle) and sank into the Thames in under four minutes. Of the approximately 700 passengers, over 600 were lost.|$|E

5000|$|The {{arrival of}} the railway excursion, often using <b>Day</b> <b>Tripper</b> tickets, in the mid 19th century saw the blossoming of a {{distinctive}} day-tripper industry.

2500|$|Before 1952, {{the inner}} German border could be crossed {{at almost any}} point along its length. The {{fortification}} of the border resulted in the severing of 32railway lines, three autobahns, 31main roads, eight primary roads, about sixty secondary roads and thousands of lanes and cart tracks. The number of crossing points was reduced to three air corridors, three road corridors, two railway lines and two river connections giving transit access to Berlin, plus a handful of additional crossing points for freight traffic. The situation improved somewhat after the rapprochement between the two German states in the 1970s. Additional border crossings for so-called kleine Grenzverkehr– [...] "small border traffic", essentially for West German <b>day</b> <b>trippers</b> – were opened at various locations along the border.|$|E

2500|$|Amsterdam {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular tourist {{destinations}} in Europe, receiving more than 4.63million international visitors annually, this is excluding the 16 million <b>day</b> <b>trippers</b> visiting the city every year. The number of visitors has been growing steadily over the past decade. This can be attributed to an increasing number of European visitors. Two-thirds of the hotels are located in the city's centre. Hotels with 4 or 5 stars contribute 42% of the total beds available and 41% of the overnight stays in Amsterdam. The room occupation rate was 78% in 2006, up from 70% in 2005. The majority of tourists (74%) originate from Europe. The largest group of non-European visitors come from the United States, accounting for 14% of the total. Certain years have a theme in Amsterdam to attract extra tourists. For example, the year 2006 was designated [...] "Rembrandt 400", to celebrate the 400th birthday of Rembrandt van Rijn.
