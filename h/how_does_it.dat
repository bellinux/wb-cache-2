It depicted {{construction workers}} who {{were satisfied with the}} working conditions at the construction site. However, further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of One World Trade Center, including 34 not reported to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Workers also left post-9/11-related graffiti at the site, which are supposed to symbolize rebirth and resilience.|$|E
25|$|It is both biochemically and {{medically}} {{interesting how}} tarantula hawk venom works. How can an essentially non-toxic venom that causes so much pain, described as blinding, debilitating, and shockingly electric by Schmidt, subside in only three minutes in humans? Only the bullet ant is ranked {{higher than the}} tarantula hawk’s sting on Schmidt’s Sting Pain Index. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> permanently paralyze a tarantula, yet keep it alive? It is also evolutionarily interesting and significant how such a toxin evolved. Selection pressure by potential vertebrate predators would have favored individuals with painful venom components, but not vertebrate-lethal components. At the same time, selection pressure against venom lethality towards prey and subsequent loss of prey to spoilage would be very strong. The tarantula hawk’s venom is a specific, evolutionarily tailored cocktail of compounds best suited to the wasps’ needs. Studying tarantula hawk venom may help us gain insight into treating human problems like chronic pain from injury or disease.|$|E

Billboard wrote of the video, [...] "it's pure sexuality. D'Angelo, muscularly cut and glistening, is shot from the hips up, naked, with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in most any woman who sees it. The video alone could make the song {{one of the biggest}} of the coming year".

Directed by Paul Hunter, the video features D'Angelo, filmed from the waist-up, lip-synching in the nude. According to writer Keith M. Harris, it portrayed D'Angelo's [...] "discursive play with masculinity and blackness". The video gained {{a significant amount of}} airplay on the BET and MTV networks, and increased mainstream notice of D'Angelo upon Voodoos release, while exposing him as a sex icon to a newer generation of fans. It also proved to contribute significantly to the album's commercial success. The music video for [...] "Untitled (<b>How</b> <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> Feel)" [...] was also viewed at a promotional party thrown in celebration of the album's release, which took place in January 2000 at the Centro-Fly nightclub in Chelsea, Manhattan. Douglas Century of The New York Times wrote of the club's appearance as [...] "packed and sweaty, with decor and soul music out of a 1970's time warp: multiple video screens playing images of Curtis Mayfield and vintage Soul Train episodes, replete with dancers in Day-Glo bell-bottoms".|$|E

500|$|Audio {{engineer}} Russell Elevado, who {{recorded and}} mixed Voodoo, along with Erykah Badu's Mama's Gun and Common's Like Water for Chocolate, used old school recording techniques and vintage mixing gear for the albums {{in order to}} achieve the distinct sounds found in classic recorded works. While mainstream recording techniques at the time often involved the use of hi-tech digital equipment, Elevado employed the use of analog equipment, enhancement plug-ins, and a blend of live instrumentation. Notable from the production was that most of it, with the exception of [...] "Untitled (<b>How</b> <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> Feel)", was recorded live with no overdubbing of its instrumentation, in contrast to contemporary R production at the time.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the final}} chorus section, [...] "Untitled (<b>How</b> <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> Feel)" [...] {{features}} a song-spanning dynamic after the bridge and guitar break that is accompanied by minor Rhodes piano and guitar chords, while the multi-tracked vocals are implemented as background whispers. Arrangements for the song are stripped back for an emphasis on vocals, leading to an enormous choral climax accompanied by overdriven electric guitar. On the song's final chorus section, critic Steve McPherson wrote [...] "after it hits a peak, it keeps rising, the chorus of voices fizzing into overdrive and the whole track gradually succumbing to a wash of reverb". The song is cut off {{in the middle of}} its culmination, ending with the line [...] "How does it fee-".|$|E

500|$|Pei's {{style is}} {{described}} as thoroughly modernist, with significant cubist themes. He is known for combining traditional architectural elements with progressive designs based on simple geometric patterns. As one critic writes: [...] "Pei has been aptly described as combining a classical sense of form with a contemporary mastery of method." [...] In 2000, biographer Carter Wiseman called Pei [...] "the most distinguished member of his Late-Modernist generation still in practice". At the same time, Pei himself rejects simple dichotomies of architectural trends. He once said: [...] "The talk about modernism versus post-modernism is unimportant. It's a side issue. An individual building, the style {{in which it is}} going to be designed and built, is not that important. The important thing, really, is the community. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> affect life?" ...|$|E

The song features a drum pattern with a uniform dynamic, which gives the impression of a live drummer playing in accordance to the sound of a drum machine. Overdubbing of D'Angelo's vocals, a contemporary R recording technique prominently used on the rest of Voodoo, was implemented a number of times during production in order to provide the sound of a choir singing harmonies during the choruses, all of which are sung by D'Angelo.|$|E
500|$|... "Untitled (<b>How</b> <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> Feel)" [...] was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} tribute to influential musician Prince. The song evokes Prince's earlier work, in particular his balladry, from his , as well as his musical style and falsetto vocal technique. As an homage to the musician, Ahmir [...] "Questlove" [...] Thompson, record producer for Voodoo, described the song as [...] "finding the line between parody and honesty ... In an era of 'the cover song', redoing a Prince song was taboo. This is the second best thing". Production of the song was handled by D'Angelo and fellow neo soul musician Raphael Saadiq, who also contributed with bass and musical arrangements during recording in 1999. The session took place at Electric Lady Studios, the recording studio originally built by influential rock musician Jimi Hendrix.|$|E
