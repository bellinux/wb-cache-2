2500|$|Schaeffer {{argues that}} the main point of de Sade's life and writing was not, [...] "as movie-makers and reviewers alike seem to think [...] to oppose censorship" [...] but [...] "to push the limits - sexual, spiritual, and {{political}} - {{as a means of}} feeling out the limits of his times and of his own mind." [...] Schaeffer criticized that the film [...] "simplifies de Sade into a modern [...] "victim" [...] and over-emphasises his potential as a focus for liberal-political meanings when, in fact, his life and perhaps his literary intentions - <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him as a satirist - can be seen as an object lesson, warning against the excesses of cultural relativism and nihilism; a very modern lesson, it would seem." ...|$|E

60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. All {{thought is}} immoral. Its very essence is destruction. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> anything, you kill it. Nothing survives being thought of.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "if you're {{still in}} the same mind to-morrow I'll come. Still, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> better <b>of</b> it, <b>you</b> can cry off then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fast, Mr. Spoker?" [...] {{asked the}} Captain. [...] "The {{expression}} {{is a strange}} one, for time (<b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it) is only relative." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I answered, {{at first}} with uncertainty, then with inspiration, [...] "he would do splendidly to lead your cotillon, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> having one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it rightly. You {{had your}} quiet life with your father--which {{was just what}} I could not {{make up my mind}} to rob you of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{does not}} make Lady Staunton and myself the less obliged to your hospitality, sir," [...] said Sir George. [...] "May I inquire <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{returning}} home soon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Frank dear, I wonder <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{me before}} <b>you</b> marry Annie Guthrie. Wherever I am I shall be {{thinking}} of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> some dreadful thing, it's {{liable to}} happen, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, {{and no one}} else <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> it, it just can't happen. Do you see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, dear!" [...] said Sue, leaning her worn {{face down}} to the pillow, [...] "think <b>of</b> me, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> won't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> yourself. What would I do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I won't go to {{the farm}} to-day," [...] replied the butterfly. [...] "Good-bye, little girl. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, leave a dish of butter around where I can get at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{living as}} the Wrenches do!" [...] said Rosamond, {{with a little}} turn of her neck. [...] "But I have heard you express your disgust at that way of living." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are such your idees of matrimony, Hetty! Ought {{the young}} to wive with the old--the pale-face with the red-skin--the Christian with the heathen? It's ag'in reason and natur', and so you'll see, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Speak quickly <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{anything}} to say. They are silent {{now because of}} their astonishment, but in another minute they will break out, and then----" ...|$|R
5000|$|Do not be {{discouraged}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> less <b>of</b> supercars after educating yourself on this topic, because all {{this means is}} that the advancement of supercars will quickly increase and upgrade as well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I cannot {{remain in}} the house," [...] said Dorothea. [...] "I shall go to Miss Pucker's,--but not till that morning; so that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> better <b>of</b> it, all may be {{prevented}} yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Miss Sharpe, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{running away}} again, after having {{come all the}} way here to make us share the {{knowledge}} of your good fortune and your better heart, by Jove! I'll go back with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You cannot, my lord. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, you'll {{find you}} cannot, without much disagreeable trouble. An eldest son {{would be a}} very {{difficult}} tenant to eject summarily: and of my own accord I will not go without the money I ask." ...|$|E
60|$|First, {{we shall}} be gone in September. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> coming in August, my mother will hunt for you with pleasure. We should all be overjoyed--though Stobo it could not be, as it is but a kirk and manse, but {{possibly}} somewhere within reach. Let us know.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Can I {{never make}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> other days than those--of the happier days to come? Or, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> must <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{the time that}} is passed, can you not look {{back to the time}} when I first loved you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Geniuses always are," [...] she says; [...] "it's {{easy enough}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> just <b>think</b> <b>of</b> them as children. He'd {{be a bit}} fractious at times, that's all. Underneath, he's just the kindest, dearest--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} a pity, Judith, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> did <b>think</b> <b>of</b> clothes, over your parents' graves! We will never quit this spot, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> say so, and will let Hurry go where he pleases." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You speak like a book, sir. By the by, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> taking home a calf or two, {{to improve}} your New England breed--there are a good many gone across the sea {{in the last few}} years--I think we could find you three or four beauties, not so very dear, {{considering}} the blood." ...|$|E
6000|$|In all cases, it {{is equally}} vain, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> their style first. But know their purpose, and then, their way of {{speaking}} is worth thinking of. These apparently unfinished and certainly unfilled outlines of the Florentine,--clumsy work, as Vasari thought them,--as Mr. Otley and most of our English amateurs still think them,--are these good or bad engraving? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't get angry, Morris. After all, {{there are}} lots of things that you and I can't understand, and it isn't odd that you should have tumbled across one of them. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, nobody understands anything. They know that certain things happen, and how to make them happen; but they don't know why they happen, or why, as in your case, when they ought to happen, they won't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} are {{beginning}} to see it in that light, my dear, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> anything to do by morning I shall be humbly thankful. I don't expect to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, then, Johnny {{shall have}} more time to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it,' {{returned}} Mrs Boffin; 'the pretty child shall have time to get used to it. And you'll get him more used to it, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> well <b>of</b> it; won't you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to do, exactly, to cure you," [...] she said; [...] "but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>think</b> <b>of</b> any plan that will really succeed, I {{will give you an}} {{excursion}} in a carriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|See, again, {{how when}} he did tell the Jews who he was, in words most awfully unmistakeable, the {{confession}} was, as it were, drawn from him, {{at the end of}} a long argument, when he was forced to speak out for truth's sake. And, even then, how simple, how modest (if I dare so speak), are his words. 'Before Abraham was, I am.' The most awful words ever spoken on earth; and yet most divine in their very simplicity. The Maker of the world telling his creatures that he is their God! What might he not have said at such a moment? What might we not fancy his saying? What words, grand enough, awful enough, might not the evangelists have put into his mouth, if they had not been men full of the spirit of truth? And yet what does the Lord say? 'Before Abraham was, I am.' [...] Could he say more? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the matter, No. But could he say less? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the manner, No, likewise.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{a perfect}} stranger, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it. What {{do any of}} you know about me? Your mother never saw my mother; your father knew nothing of my father; there is no kindred blood common to us. Harry Norman, there, is your near cousin; but what am I that I should be thus allowed to live with you, and walk with you, and have a common {{interest}} in all your doings?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Beatrice, dear, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{what you}} are asking, I am sure {{you will see that}} it would not do; would not do at all. Miss Thorne is a very nice girl, I am sure; and, indeed, what little I have seen of her I highly approve. But, after all, who is she? Mamma, I know, thinks that Aunt Arabella has been wrong to let her be here so much, but--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, I'm sure you'll find it is {{the proper}} thing to do. There {{is nothing to be}} avoided so much as an open quarrel, that all the {{servants}} can see." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sadie {{urged that}} one got nothing worth having without a struggle. Bob rejoined: [...] "If {{you get the}} thing you aim at, the struggle's justified; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> what you've missed while you were uselessly employed. Of course, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like a struggle, you have the {{satisfaction}} of following your bent; but hustling is a habit that has no charm for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then I {{tell you}} {{it would be the}} most {{vexatious}} proceeding ever I heard of in all my practice. But you are in my hands, Mr. Tudor, and you can't do it. You have done me the honour to come to me, and now you must be ruled by me. Plead guilty! Why, with such a case as you have got, you would disgrace yourself for ever <b>if</b> <b>you</b> did so. <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> your friends, Mr. Tudor, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> won't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me or of yourself.' ...|$|R
