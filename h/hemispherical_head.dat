2500|$|The [...] "Sprint" [...] and [...] "Sprint Metro" [...] {{differed}} in their engines, though both were computer controlled carb systems. From 1985 to 1988, the carbureted 1.0-liter 3-cylinder engine used a <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head</b> design.

50|$|Melaleuca megacephala is a {{plant in}} the myrtle family Myrtaceae and is native to the {{south-west}} of Western Australia. It is distinguished by its large, <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> of yellow and white flowers {{on the ends of}} the branches and the overlapping brown bracts under them.|$|R
50|$|Meandrina is a genus {{of colonial}} stony coral {{in the family}} Meandrinidae. Corals in this genus form massive <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> or have large flat plates and can grow to a metre (yard) across. Meandrina meandrites {{is found in the}} Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico but the other two species are endemic to Mozambique.|$|R
5000|$|Melaleuca seriata is a shrub in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, and is {{endemic to}} the {{south-west}} of Western Australia. In describing it, John Lindley wrote [...] "Melaleuca seriata, parviceps, and trichophylla, are bushes, every twig {{of which is}} terminated by <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> of a brilliant pink." [...] It {{is very similar to}} Melaleuca parviceps.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, OREX {{is a test}} vehicle of HOPE-X and {{launched}} into 450 km LEO using H-II in 1994. OREX succeeded to reenter, {{but it was only}} <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head</b> of HOPE-X, that is, not plane-shaped.|$|E
50|$|A ball-peen (also spelled ball-pein) hammer, {{also known}} as a machinist's hammer, is a type of peening hammer used in metalworking. It is {{distinguished}} from a cross-peen hammer, diagonal-peen hammer, point-peen hammer, or chisel-peen hammer by having a <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head.</b> It is commonly used as a tool for metalworking.|$|E

5000|$|Melaleuca parviceps, {{commonly}} known as rough honey-myrtle is a shrub in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a shrub with varying shades of pink or purple flowers, the stamens tipped with yellow anthers. In describing it, John Lindley noted: [...] "every twig ... is terminated by <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> of brilliant pink". It is similar to Melaleuca manglesii and Melaleuca seriata.|$|R
5000|$|The American-market Renault 12 came {{in three}} trim lines: 12, 12 L, and 12 TL, ranging {{in price from}} an {{inexpensive}} US$ 2975 to US$3448. It was a slightly larger car than most European imports, and the longitudinal front wheel drive layout contrasted with most. The engine, an R16 all-aluminum 1.6 L (1,647 cc) unit which produced , was specific to the U.S. market. It was upgraded in 1975 with <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> and a higher compression ratio for [...]|$|R
5000|$|This {{species was}} first {{formally}} described in 1839 by John Lindley in A {{sketch of the}} vegetation of the Swan River Colony where he noted that [...] "every twig ... is terminated by <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> of brilliant pink". The specific epithet (trichophylla) is from the Greek thrix meaning [...] "hair" [...] and phyllon meaning [...] "leaf" [...] {{in reference to the}} hairy leaves. It is a member of Melaleuca, a large and diverse genus whose members range from large trees such as M. quinquenervia, to small shrubs.|$|R
5000|$|September 1978 brought another engine upgrade: The new [...] "Vulcan II" [...] G23B {{featured}} the lean burn MCA-Jet {{emissions control system}} with a <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head,</b> aluminium rocker arms and three valves per cylinder, but power outputs remained static. The model code became A106, with A106V used for the van which continued to use the bodywork of the second generation.|$|E
50|$|Distinguishing {{characters}} of Supayacetus include: a T-shaped manubrium with a rod-shaped process; cheek teeth with accessory denticles; a broad scapula {{with a large}} infraspinous fossa; humerus with large and <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head,</b> well-defined proximal tuberosities, a long deltopectoral crest, and a broad shaft. Compared to other basilosaurids, Supayacetus is larger than Protocetus but its skull and vertebrae are smaller than in other basilosaurids.|$|E

50|$|Douglas {{motorcycles}} {{also became}} popular in dirt track racing. The 1923 RA model with disc brakes was favoured initially and this prompted Douglas to build specific dirt track models. These motorcycle designs were gradually increased {{in size and}} power with 500 cc and 600 cc engines fitted to the DT5 and DT6 Dirt Track models in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The engines had <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> and a short rigid forged crankshaft. They dominated dirt track racing for about three years. In 1929, the most successful dirt racing year, 1,200 Dirt Track motorcycles were sold.|$|R
50|$|Alfa Romeo has {{produced}} many successful hemi-head engines throughout the years. Arguably {{one of their}} most beloved examples is Giuseppe Busso's original 2.5-liter V6, which has been cited by some {{as one of the best}} and most distinctive sounding production engines (even in its latter 24v forms) of all time. Part of this praise is likely because the <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> on the original 2-valve engine allowed for an almost completely straight exhaust port, resulting in a less diluted or muddied engine sound, allowing Alfa Romeo to use quieter stock exhausts without losing much of their distinct and beloved race-bred engine noise.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} white to pale yellow and {{arranged}} in <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads,</b> {{mostly on the}} ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering but sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. The heads are about 18 mm in diameter and contain 3 to 10 individual flowers. The petals are 1.7-3 mm long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 10 to 18 stamens. Flowering occurs in spring and early summer and is followed by fruit which are woody, barrel-shaped capsules more or less scattered along the branches.|$|R
50|$|Designed by {{engineer}} Andrew Strand, {{a powerful}} 61 cubic inch (996cc) 45 degree V-Twin SOHC, 45 horsepower engine was the powerplant {{chosen for the}} Cyclone. The overhead cams were driven by a vertical shaft with beveled-gear ends, and the cylinder-head had a <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head</b> combustion chamber. The Cyclone was capable of at least 115 mph top speed. Joerns Motor Co. sold the original Cyclone for $350.00.|$|E
5000|$|In {{this time}} period, Renault chose small saloon cars to {{represent}} the company in automobile racing. To do this, Renault began with work similar to that Gordini had done 10 years earlier, but {{at a much lower}} cost. The [...] "Cl√©on-Fonte", now with a new <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head,</b> was pushed to 1397cc producing 93 hp in the 1976 R5 Alpine/Gordini; power output increased to 110 bhp in 1981 for the R5 Alpine/Gordini Turbo.|$|E
5000|$|Ardun {{heads for}} the Ford {{flathead}} were perhaps the first use of a <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head</b> on a readily available American V8. [...] First offered in 1947 as an aftermarket product, these heads converted the Ford flathead to overhead valves operating in a hemispherical chamber. Zora Arkus-Duntov, who later worked for GM and was a major force behind {{the development of the}} Chevrolet Corvette, and his brother Yura, were the [...] "AR" [...] "DUN" [...] of [...] "Ardun." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{single most}} {{significant}} technical {{achievement in the}} development of Dolphin is the pressure hull itself. It is a constant diameter cylinder, closed at its ends with <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads,</b> and utilizes deep frames instead of bulkheads. The entire design of the pressure hull has been kept as simple as possible to facilitate its use in structural experiments and trials. Hull openings have been minimized for structural strength and minimum hull weight, in addition to eliminating possible sources for flooding casualties. The submarine has no snorkel mast; her one hatch must be open while her diesels are running.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{ships are}} {{launched}} using {{a series of}} inflated tubes underneath the hull, which deflate to cause a downward slope into the water. This procedure has the advantages of requiring less permanent infrastructure, risk, and cost. The airbags provide support to the hull {{of the ship and}} aid its launching motion into the water, thus this method is arguably safer than other options such as sideways launching. These airbags are usually cylindrical in shape with <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> at both ends.The Xiao Qinghe shipyard launched a tank barge with marine airbags on January 20, 1981, the first known use of marine airbags.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is similar}} in concept to the hemi engine, both in design and purpose, but a <b>hemispherical</b> {{cylinder}} <b>head</b> is limited to only two valves {{without the use of}} a more complex sub-rocker assembly.|$|R
50|$|The 2.5 V8/V8-250 is a four-door saloon {{which was}} {{produced}} by The Daimler Company Limited in the United Kingdom from 1962 to 1969. It was the first Daimler car {{to be based on}} a Jaguar platform, the first Daimler car with a unit body, and the last Daimler car to feature a Daimler engine after the company was bought from the Birmingham Small Arms Company by Jaguar Cars in 1960. The engine is the <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head</b> V8 designed by Edward Turner and first used in the Daimler SP250 sports car.|$|E
5000|$|At top {{dead centre}} the pistons of a petrol engine are flush (or nearly flush) with {{the top of the}} {{cylinder}} block. The combustion chamber may be a recess either in the cylinder head, or {{in the top of the}} piston. A design with the combustion chamber in the piston is called a Heron head, where the head is machined flat but the pistons are dished. The Heron head has proved even more thermodynamically efficient than the <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head.</b> Intake valves [...] permit the inflow of a fuel air mix; and exhaust valves allow burnt gases to be scavenged.|$|E
5000|$|From 1984 to 1988 the {{standard}} G10 engine used a <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head</b> carbureted design with mechanical lifters. From 1989 to 2001 the engine received updates {{in the form}} of throttle body injection and hydraulic lifters. A detuned [...] unit, with a slightly different camshaft, two-ring pistons and differently tuned engine control unit, was used in the ultra-fuel-efficient Geo Metro XFi model, which delivered as much as 58 miles per gallon. In the US, the G10 in the 2000 Chevrolet Metro became the last engine available on an American-sold vehicle to use throttle body injection for fuel delivery.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s, Ford {{designed}} {{and produced a}} small-block engine with <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> to address the growing concerns about fuel economy. Unfortunately, even with an ahead-of-its-time direct fuel injection system feeding a stratified charge chamber, the hemi's emissions could not be made clean enough for compliance with regulations. This plus {{the cost of the}} valve actuation systems, along with the cost of the high pressure pump needed to deliver fuel directly into the chamber, as well as the gilmer belt drive system needed to drive the pump, made further development pointless at the time. Most 1980s 4-cylinder Fords used the Ford CVH engine, CVH meaning [...] "Compound Valve, Hemispherical (Head)".|$|R
50|$|Another {{version of}} the twin spark plug method was {{introduced}} on the Nissan Stanza with the CA engine, called NAPS-X, which eventually replaced the NAPS-Z approach. The CA engine implemented a <b>hemispherical</b> cylinder <b>head,</b> an approach used by several auto makers.|$|R
5000|$|Once, the straight-eight was the {{prestige}} engine arrangement; {{it could be}} made more cheaply than a V-engine by luxury car makers, who would focus on other specifics than the geometric ones, and even built engines more powerful than any V8 engine. In the 1930s, Duesenberg used a cylinder block made from aluminium alloy, with four valves per cylinder and <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> to produce the most powerful engine on the market. It was thus a selling point for Pontiac to introduce the cheapest straight-eight in 1933. However, following World War II, the straight-eight was supplanted by the lighter and more compact V8 engine, which allowed shorter engine bays {{to be used in}} the design.|$|R
5000|$|The K-Type {{engine is}} an {{evolution}} of [...] "Energy engine", {{it is intended}} to replace. The [...] "Energy engine" [...] was already an evolution of [...] "Cl√©on-Fonte engine" [...] in which a <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head</b> incorporating head camshaft driven by a toothed timing belt was fitted. The K-Type engine is the ultimate evolution of the [...] "Cl√©on-Fonte engine". The main modification of the K-Type engine is operated at machining cylinder, since this engine has removable liners. The 8-valve cylinder versions species is taken from Energy engine. The first engine K appears on the Megane 1 with a capacity of 1598 cm3, with a yoke 8 valves, K7M.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head</b> {{design was}} revived in 1964. These {{were the first}} engines officially {{designated}} Hemi, a name Chrysler had trademarked. Chrysler Hemi engines of this generation displaced 426 cuin L. Just 11,000 Hemi engines were ultimately produced for consumer sale due to their relatively high cost and {{the sheer size of}} the engine bay required to fit it in. The 426 Hemi was nicknamed the [...] "elephant engine" [...] at the time, a reference to its high power, heavy weight and large physical dimensions. Its 10.72 in deck height and 4.80 in bore spacing made it the biggest engine in racing at the time.|$|E
50|$|Craspedia variabilis {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 10 - 60 cm, with one to five flower spikes {{surrounded}} by a rosette of leaves, with more leaves scattered along the flower spike. Each leaf is spoon-shaped, about 5 - 13 cm long and 5 - 20 mm wide. The leaves are pale to olive-green and the flower spike straw-coloured to reddish and both leaves and flower spike are hairy. It has thick, spreading woolly roots and broad, reddish, overlapping leaf-bases which are retained {{at the base of}} the flower spike. The flowers, which appear from early spring to early summer, form a <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head</b> of about 40-100 small, golden-yellow individual small flowers, each with a short stalk.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} effect of element size and {{adaptive}} re-meshing technique in numerical simulation of incremental sheet forming (ISF) process. In ISF a <b>hemispherical</b> <b>headed</b> tool moves along the specified trajectory to deform the sheet in to required shape. This tool path is generally very long and thus increases the computational time. Therefore, in this work adaptive re- meshing technique {{has been used to}} minimize the computational time without sacrificing the accuracy of the results. For this a varying wall angle conical frustum was simulated using shell elements with different element edge lengths and adaptive mesh. Effects of these mesh parameters on plastic strain, punch force and form accuracy of deformed geometry has been studied. The necessary simulations for this study are performed using explicit finite element code LS-DYNA...|$|R
40|$|Containment {{structures}} for nuclear reactors are the final barrier between released radionuclides and the public. Containment structures are constructed from steel, reinforced concrete, or prestressed concrete. US nuclear reactor containment geometries {{tend to be}} cylindrical with elliptical or <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads.</b> The older Soviet designed reactors do not use a containment building to mitigate the effects of accidents. Instead, they employ a sealed set of rectilinear, interconnected compartments, collectively called the accident localization system (ALS), to reduce the release of radionuclides to the atmosphere during accidents. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a methodology that can be used to find the structural capacity of reinforced concrete structures. The method is applicable to both cylindrical and rectilinear geometries. As an illustrative example, the methodology is applied to a generic VVER- 440 /V 213 design...|$|R
50|$|Meandrina meandrites forms massive <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> or {{develops}} into substantial flat {{plates and}} can grow to nearly 1 m in diameter. Some small colonies are cone-shaped {{and are not}} attached to the substrate. These resemble young colonies of rose coral (Manicina areolata) and {{may be found in}} sandy or muddy areas some way from reefs. The corallites, the calcareous cups secreted by the polyps, are 1 to 2 cm wide. The raised walls between the corallites are formed from fine but widely separated transverse ridges called septa and meander over the surface of the coral. There is a slight indentation running along the crest of the walls where the septa from adjoining corallites meet. The polyps are large but are only protruded at night when they cover and obscure the skeleton of the coral.|$|R
