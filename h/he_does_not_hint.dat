60|$|Thus ended this unparalleled transaction. The author, I believe, {{will not}} claim {{any part of}} the glory of it: he will leave it whole and entire to the authors of the measure. The money was the voluntary, free gift of the Company; the rescinding bill was the act of legislature, to which they and we owe submission: the author {{has nothing to do with}} the one or with the other. However, he cannot avoid rubbing himself against this subject merely for the {{pleasure}} of stirring controversies, and gratifying a certain pruriency of taxation that seems to infect his blood. It is merely to indulge himself in speculations of taxing, that he chooses to harangue on this subject. For he takes credit for no greater sum than the public is already in possession of. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>hint</b> that the Company means, or has ever shown any disposition, if managed with common prudence, to pay less in future; and he cannot doubt that the present ministry are as well inclined to drive them by their mock inquiries, and real rescinding bills, as he can possibly be with his taxes. Besides, it is obvious, that as great a sum might have been drawn from that Company, without affecting property, or shaking the constitution, or endangering the principle of public credit, or running into his golden dreams of cockets on the Ganges, or visions of stamp-duties on Perwannas, Dusticks, Kistbundees, and Husbulhookums. For once, I will disappoint him in this part of the dispute; and only in a very few words recommend to his consideration, how he is to get off the dangerous idea of taxing a public fund, if he levies those duties in England; and if he is to levy them in India, what provision he has made for a revenue establishment there; supposing that he undertakes this new scheme of finance independently of the Company, and against its inclinations.|$|E

Playford {{continued}} to lead the LCL opposition for a further {{one and a half}} years until he relinquished the leadership. In the subsequent ballot, Steele Hall, a small farmer like Playford, won and led the LCL to victory at the following election with the Playmander still in place. Contrary to perceptions, Playford was loath to favour or groom a successor, and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> publicly <b>hint</b> at whom he voted for in the leadership ballot; there was speculation that the former premier may have been one of those who abstained from the vote. Playford retired from politics at the same time, presumably for reasons of age, but stated that [...] "I couldn't cope with the change in the attitudes of some MPs, even some in the highest places... I found I could no longer cope with the change... I can't handle a liar who doesn't turn a hair while he's lying... I decided I couldn't take it any longer".|$|R

As he crossed the platforms between them he met an icy wind and saw the dark pines stream by. It was obvious that the track was nearly level and the train running fast, for dusky woods and snowy banks flung back a rapid snorting and a confused roll of wheels. There were not many passengers and nobody seemed to notice Foster, until as they entered a car near the end a man raised a newspaper he was reading so that it hid his face. As they left the car Foster thought he heard a rustle, as if the paper had been lowered, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> look round.

50|$|Somervile was {{the eldest}} son of a country gentleman, and was born at Edstone, in the parish of Warren, Warwickshire in 1677. He was educated at Winchester College and at New College, Oxford, where he studied law. While in school <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> show any <b>hint</b> of great {{knowledge}} of literature or {{seem to have a}} knack for writing poetry. His love of poetry <b>did</b> <b>not</b> come until <b>he</b> was of middle age. He {{was a part of the}} Whig Party. After his father's death in 1705 he lived on his estate. He was known to be very hospitable and convivial. This however plunged him into debt, which carried a heavy burden and consequently put him into the habits that ultimately shortened his life. He was not someone one would expect to become a poet, he rather enjoyed sports including horseback riding and hunting.|$|R
50|$|The {{pre-production}} {{began in}} October 2007 {{with the first}} draft for the screenplay ready by March 2009. In early 2011, an enormous set of an estimate 100 hectares area was built near the city Qom. The set resembled sixth-century Mecca and Medina {{during the early years}} of the life of Muhammad. A replica of Kaaba shrine was built in the remote village of Mazraeh-ye Allahyar. In October 2011, Majidi officially announced the project, calling it as his 'most ambitious and expensive film project'. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>hint</b> about the title of the project or its content but he added that it would 'bring pride to Iran and Iranians'. By the following month, filming had commenced and minister of culture and Islamic guidance Mohammad Hosseini confirmed that a movie about Muhammad was being filmed. The film was partially funded by Iranian government. Further, Mohammad Mehdi Heidarian was announced as the producer. Shining Light (Noor-e-Taban) was the project's financial backer. However, in a turn of events, reports of November 2012, claimed the film was titled Muhammad's Childhood. Majidi opined that many Muslims know so little about the prophet’s upbringing. His objective was to orientate the audience with the period of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic era), and how it was before the appearance of the Prophet. Majidi framed the screenplay to depict Quraysh tribe and how the Prophet was raised against this backdrop yet developed very firm principles since an early age. The cinematographer of the film Vittorio Storaro, arrived in Iran with a 30-man crew. Storato accepted the project after he had a brief discussion about the film with Majidi in Rome. Scott E. Anderson was involved as a visual effects supervisor. Croatian production designer Miljen Kreka Kljakovic directed the art of the film. According to Majidi, he and a research team of historians and archaeologists had consulted with Shia and Sunni scholars from Iran, Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon and Iraq in order to ensure accurate portrayal of Muhammad's early years. Further consultations of Majidi were advices of jurists and clerics to explain his vision and the impressions that he wanted to communicate through this film. He met and discussed the film with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who supported and viewed the final movie, Ali Al-Sistani, Ayatollah Wahid Khorasani, and Iranian philosopher Ayatullah Jawadi Amuli were involved. Majidi's research team also sought the advice of Sunni Ulama, among whom was the Turkish Hayrettin Karaman. Giannetto De Rossi was chosen to provide make up to the characters. Costume designers from Germany, Croatia and Slovenia were chosen in August 2013. While speaking at a press conference, for the creation of a logotype representing Muhammad, Majidi stated that the film intends to fight against any improper image of Islam the West has in mind. The logotype was designed by calligrapher Mohammad Jalil Rasouli. Mohammed Mahdi Heidarian, head of the Noor-e-Taban Film Industry Company Production, confirmed that his firm had spent $40 million on the epic film.|$|R
6000|$|Besides that, says Lord Dunraven, {{the colonies}} {{are by far}} our best customers, and our only chance of {{increasing}} or maintaining our trade lies in 'the development of the colonies.' What development means <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> very clearly explain. Subsidised emigration and all such devices he dismisses as futile. Some means should be devised, he says, whereby the independent colonies should {{have a voice in}} the management of matters affecting the empire: what those means might exactly be <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> even <b>hint.</b> The mother country and the colonies might be drawn closer together by the abandonment of free trade and the formation of an imperial Zollverein or Greater British Customs Union. In this way capital would move more freely within the empire from one portion to another--as if capital which has gone from Great Britain to the Australian group of colonies to such a tune that the public indebtedness there is three times the amount per head in the mother country (to say nothing of the vast sums embarked in private enterprise, bringing up the aggregate debt to a million and a quarter), <b>did</b> <b>not</b> move quite freely enough as it is. Supply would at last have an opportunity of accommodating itself to demand without let or hindrance over {{a large portion of the}} earth's surface--as if more were necessary for this than the simple reduction of their tariffs, which is within the power of the protectionist colonies without federation, confederation, or any other device whatever. As it is, by the way, the colonies take nearly four times as much per head per annum of our manufactures as is taken by the United States (32s. against 8s. 4d.) ...|$|R

Polly, I 'm ashamed of you! What would your blessed mother say to hear such expressions from you?

No, I 'll leave mother in peace, and fight it out alone. I do think Fan would suit him excellently by and by. He has known her all her life, and has a good influence over her. Love would do so much toward making her what she might be; it 's a shame to have the chance lost just because he happens to see me. I should think she 'd hate me; but I 'll show her that she need <b>n't,</b> and <b>do</b> all I can to help her; for she has been so good to me nothing shall ever make me forget that. It is a delicate and dangerous task, but I guess I can manage it; at any rate I 'll try, and have nothing to reproach myself with if things do go 'contrary.'" ...|$|R
