5|$|Aside {{from his}} death, remarkably {{little is known}} of Cooke's circumstances. Even his date of birth is unclear, and unlike many of his <b>fellow</b> <b>officers,</b> Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well {{respected}} in his profession and following his death {{was the subject of}} tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in St Paul's Cathedral and his local church in Wiltshire.|$|E
5|$|Balchen {{died in the}} {{shipwreck}} of the 100-gun first-rate HMS Victory off the Casquets in the Channel Islands during {{operations to}} deter French blockading of Spanish and Portuguese ports during the War of the Austrian Succession. A capable and efficient officer, Balchen never found the wealth and prestige <b>fellow</b> <b>officers</b> secured in other commissions, a fact which remained a source of frustration to him until his elevation to knighthood shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|Bitterest {{of all was}} the {{whispering}} campaign {{directed at}} Anthony Molloy, captain of HMS Caesar. Molloy was accused of cowardice by <b>fellow</b> <b>officers</b> for his failure to follow Howe's orders on both 29 May and 1 June. Molloy's request for an official court-martial to clear his name failed, and although his personal courage was not called into question, his professional ability was. Molloy was dismissed from his ship.|$|E

5|$|Rotheram {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a difficult officer to serve with, and he rapidly alienated his <b>fellow</b> <b>officers</b> and the sailors who served under him. Ultimately this character trait resulted in his removal from service and overlooking for promotion in 1808 after being court martialled for inappropriate behaviour towards junior officers. The rest of his life was spent requesting the Admiralty, often in an aggressive manner, for both further service and the rewards he felt were his due.|$|E
5|$|This appeal {{caused a}} {{reaction}} from the opposition forces: Odobescu rallied {{to the cause of}} conservatives, and, on July 1, 1848, together with his <b>fellow</b> <b>officers</b> Ioan Solomon and Grigorie Lăcusteanu, arrested the entire Government. The coup almost succeeded, being ultimately overturned by the reaction of Bucharesters, who organized street resistance against mutinied troops, mounted barricades, and, eventually, stormed into the executive's headquarters. The latter assault, led by Ana Ipătescu, resulted in the arrest of all coup leaders.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, he co-starred in Scarecrow, with Gene Hackman, {{and won the}} Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. That same year, Pacino was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for Best Actor after starring in Serpico, based on {{the true story of}} New York City policeman Frank Serpico, who went undercover to expose the corruption of <b>fellow</b> <b>officers.</b> In 1974, Pacino reprised his role as Michael Corleone in the sequel The Godfather Part II, which was the first sequel to win the Best Picture Oscar; Pacino, meanwhile, {{was nominated}} for his third Oscar.|$|E

5|$|In March 1861, Victoria's {{mother and}} Albert's aunt, the Duchess of Kent, died and Victoria was grief-stricken; Albert took {{on most of}} the Queen's duties, despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble. The last public event he presided over was the opening of the Royal Horticultural Gardens on 5 June 1861. In August, Victoria and Albert visited the Curragh Camp, Ireland, where the Prince of Wales was doing army service. At the Curragh, the Prince of Wales was introduced, by his <b>fellow</b> <b>officers,</b> to Nellie Clifden, an Irish actress.|$|E
5|$|In his {{civilian}} life, Harvey pursued {{political interests}} and spent three spells as a Member of Parliament for Maldon and later Essex. During this period {{he was also}} knighted. However, Harvey was not a peaceable man and his life {{both in and out}} of the Navy was frequently punctuated by disputes with <b>fellow</b> <b>officers</b> and politicians. One such dispute, a consequence of the Battle of Basque Roads, eventually cost Harvey his career; a bitter exchange with Lord Gambier forcing Harvey into early retirement in 1809. Although reinstated a year later, Harvey was never again employed in an official capacity and further promotions were only bestowed as a matter of seniority.|$|E
5|$|Many of Model's <b>fellow</b> <b>officers</b> {{considered}} him a Nazi. He frequently harangued his troops {{to have faith}} in the Führer and uphold the virtues of National Socialism. He accepted the offer of SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein to appoint a Waffen-SS officer as his adjutant at Army Group North in 1944, after the Heerespersonalamt had refused him an adjutant, and filled the Nationalsozialistischer Führungsoffizier (NSFO, essentially a Nazi political commissar) post at Army Group B that had been vacant before his arrival. His habit of parroting the Führer's orders caused him to be viewed as a sycophant, even if he often undermined or ignored those orders in practice.|$|E

5|$|Presented with a jewelled brooch as a {{farewell}} gift by her <b>fellow</b> <b>officers,</b> Stevenson asked that its value instead be put towards a scholarship for an ex-WAAAF member to study social {{work at the}} University of Sydney. The WAAAF itself, the first and largest of Australia's wartime women's services, was disbanded on 30September 1946. It was succeeded in 1950 by a new organisation with a separate charter to the RAAF, the Women's Royal Australian Air Force (WRAAF). WRAAF members achieved a pay scale equal to the male service in 1972, and five years later were integrated with the RAAF.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many of his}} <b>fellow</b> <b>officers,</b> Marshall {{was reduced}} to his {{substantive}} rank of first lieutenant on 18 November 1922. On 4 August 1923 he {{took charge of the}} Engineer Office of the 3rd New York District, located in Fort Hancock, New Jersey. He then served in the Panama Canal Zone as a company commander in the 11th Engineers from 9 April 1926 to 14 June 1928. He became an instructor in the Department of Engineering at West Point on 24 August 1928. He was posted to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, on 10 August 1932, where he was promoted to captain again on 1 June 1933. There followed duty in the Office of the Chief Of Engineers in Washington, DC, as Assistant Chief of the River and Harbor Section from 21 January 1937 to 3 September 1939.|$|E
5|$|Model's {{decision}} to burn all his personal papers {{at the end}} of World War II means relatively little is known about his early years. Born to a music teacher in Genthin, Saxony, he belonged to a lower-middle class, non-military family. Following schooling at the Bürgerschule (citizen school) in Genthin, he graduated with his Abitur from the , a humanities oriented secondary school, on Easter 1909. He entered the army officer cadet school (Kriegsschule) in Neisse (now Nysa, Poland) in 1909, where he was an unexceptional student, and was commissioned a lieutenant (Leutnant) in the 52nd Infantry Regiment von Alvensleben in 1910. He made few friends among his <b>fellow</b> <b>officers</b> and soon became known for his ambition, drive, and blunt outspokenness. These were characteristics that would mark his entire career.|$|E

5|$|Overnight, the 1st and 3rd Parachute battalions had skirted as {{far south}} as 2nd Parachute Battalion's {{original}} route into the city, hoping to follow them into Arnhem centre. They approached the German line before light and for several hours attempted to fight through the German positions. Spindler's force—being continually reinforced—was too strong to penetrate, and by 10:00 the British advance was stopped. A more coordinated attack followed in the afternoon, but it too was repulsed. Urquhart attempted to return to his Divisional Headquarters at Oosterbeek but became cut off and was forced to take shelter in a Dutch family's loft with two <b>fellow</b> <b>officers.</b> Lathbury was injured and also forced into hiding.|$|E
5|$|The {{propeller}} blade from Little's Sopwith Triplane was {{fitted with a}} clock in its hub by his <b>fellow</b> <b>officers,</b> who presented it to his widow; she transported it back to Australia in three pieces and it later went {{on display at the}} Australian War Memorial, along with his awards and the wooden cross of his original burial place at Nœux. The Sopwith Pup he flew with No.8 Squadron RNAS, N5182, was rebuilt to flying standard and in October 1976 led a flypast to commemorate the squadron's Diamond Jubilee, before going on permanent display at the Royal Air Force Museum, Hendon. One of the buildings of the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) in Canberra, opened in 1986, was named in Little's honour.|$|E
5|$|The {{specifically}} military grievances {{that led}} to the mutiny of the 5th Light Infantry centred on the personality of the commanding officer at the time, Lieutenant-Colonel E. V. Martin. He had been promoted from major in the regiment, bur the previous colonel had reported that he was unpopular with his <b>fellow</b> <b>officers</b> and that he inspired little respect among the men. His appointment led to disunity amongst the British officers, which was reflected by division among the Indian officers over the promotion to commissioned rank of a colour-havildar. The issues, which might, under ordinary circumstances, have been of limited impact, were aggregated by the disruptive external influences of the Ghadar Party propaganda noted above and the entry of Turkey into the war.|$|E

5|$|His nephew and biographer (Ferdinand Brock Tupper) {{asserts that}} shortly after Brock joined the regiment, a {{professional}} dueller forced a match on him. As the one being challenged Brock had {{his choice of}} terms, and he insisted that they use pistols. His friends were shocked as Brock was a large target and his opponent an expert shot. Brock, however, refused to change his mind. When the duellist arrived at the field, he asked Brock to decide how many paces they would take. Brock insisted that the duel would take place not at the usual range, but at handkerchief distance (i.e., close range). The duellist declined and subsequently {{was forced to leave}} the regiment. This contributed to Brock's popularity and reputation among his <b>fellow</b> <b>officers,</b> as this duellist had a formidable reputation and was reportedly regarded as a bully in the regiment. During his time with this regiment, Brock served in the Caribbean, where he fell ill with fever and nearly died. He did not fully recover until after returning to England in 1793.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Rommel {{received}} a promotion from Hitler {{to the rank}} of Generalmajor ahead of more senior officers. Showalter notes that even at this early stage, Hitler already regarded Rommel {{as a model for the}} fusion of Germany's new and old orders. With an intervention by Hitler, Rommel was subsequently able to obtain command of an armoured (Panzer) division despite having been turned down by the army's personnel office, which had offered him command of a mountain division. Rommel's unprofessional conduct was noted by his <b>fellow</b> <b>officers</b> and added to his growing reputation as one of Hitler's favoured commanders. After the Fall of France, Rommel sent to him a specially prepared diary on the 7th Division, Rommel {{received a}} letter of thanks. Unknown to Rommel though, Hitler had barely looked at his diary and the letter was written by an adjutant. Remy remarks that by this time, Hitler still did not treat Rommel as a significantly important person.|$|E
5|$|During {{the year}} after Khánh's rise to power, Thi helped Khánh stage or put down several coup attempts, making him {{a key player in}} South Vietnamese {{military}} politics. In September 1964, he and Kỳ helped rescue Khánh from a coup attempt by two disgruntled Catholic Diệmist generals, Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức. This gave Kỳ and Thi increased leverage in the junta. Two months later, he was prominent in shutting down a junta-appointed civilian advisory body after they disapproved of a plan by younger officers to compulsorily retire old generals. In January 1965, he helped Khánh depose the junta-appointed civilian Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương, but by this time he had turned against Khánh. In February 1965, he helped defeat a coup attempt by Phát and Phạm Ngọc Thảo, and helped to force Khánh's resignation at the same time. Over the next year, Kỳ and Thi were the foremost officers in the junta, and in June 1965, Thi declined an opportunity to serve as prime minister after being nominated by his <b>fellow</b> <b>officers</b> following the resignation of civilian Phan Huy Quát. Thi wanted to let a rival take the job and then step in after he had failed, but he never received a second opportunity.|$|E
