In the early school years of developmental speech – if a language disorder appears, it is often followed by the disruption of the phonological – articulation segment. This research aims to establish and compare frequency, type, and every articulate and acoustic characteristics of the disordered sound in both children with <b>Dyslalia,</b> {{as well as those}} with SLI. This micro investigation was done using 71 examinees ages 6 to 8. Thirty-five examinees were with <b>Dyslalia</b> and 36 had SLI. Their achievements are underlined using comparative analysis, tested with two relevant tests. Some of the more important conclusions are:Children with <b>Dyslalia</b> mostly showed distorted sounds, while those with SLI mostly substituted the disordered sound. In <b>Dyslalia,</b> fricatives were most affected, {{but in the case of}} SLI, all sound groups were disordered usually. In both tested groups, the type of disorder was due to the misplacement of sound formation.

40|$|Background: Anterior open bite AOB is {{the most}} common {{malocclusion}} associated with speech disorders and the literature has shown that problems of occlusion involve all oral functions. AOB not only produce aesthetic and occlusal problems for the patient and modifies the union of the lips, tongue, teeth, palate, palatal rugae and oropharynx, and thus affecting the ability to communicate well with their surroundings. The prevalence of AOB in children and adolescent in our population is unknown. Furthermore, the most frequent type of dyslalias in children with this malocclusion is also unknown. Therefore, the aim {{of the study was to}} describe the frequency and types of <b>dyslalia</b> in students between 8 - 16 years with AOB, as well as the difference in the types of <b>dyslalia</b> according to the magnitude of AOB. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted. Clinical assessment of AOB in students from the municipality of Envigado, Colombia, was performed. Students from 8 to 16 years of age were examined during the second semester of 2011 and first semester of 2012. Phonoaudiological assessment was carried out in students in the mixed or permanent dentition. Exclusion criteria included children with history of systemic disease, altered skeletal development, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and residents in other departments. In addition, students undergoing orthodontic treatment at the time of evaluation or with history of previous orthodontic treatment, as well as those who did not cooperate with the oral cavity evaluation, were excluded. Results: Six thousand one hundred sixty five children were evaluated. One hundred sixty six presented AOB (prevalence: 2. 7 %; 95 % CI: 2. 28 – 3. 10).

Further examinations regard the disposition for stammering. On the basis of research with monozygotic twins, of which one partner during the examination presented only signs of cluttering, the other one, however, clonic-tonic stammering, while both twins had a pathologic electroencephalogram, the hereditary basis of speech defects and stammering is shown.

The aim {{of this study is to}} report a case in monozygotic twins and review the literature relating to the description of similar cases as well as the pathophysiological mechanism involved in its development. Methods Clinical examination and simple X-rays revealed scoliosis of differing degrees and types in male monozygotic twins with moderate mental retardation and <b>dyslalia.</b> Results Congenital scoliosis identified in both twins.

Case: A 64 -year-old woman was admitted with headache and <b>dyslalia</b> and reported some episodes of vertigo and falls {{in the last six}} months. A superficial red and dark skin discoloration in the scalp and a node in the right parotid gland were observed. Computed tomography of the brain showed nodular lesions in the left parietal and right temporal and occipital lobes with hemorrhagic features, in addition to mass effect. Furthermore, PET-CT images were suggestive of brain, lung, and adrenal metastasis. The patient evolved with intracranial hypertension and a neurosurgery was performed. Histopathological and immunohistochemistry studies revealed metastatic melanoma. Conclusions: She underwent schedules of radiation therapy and chemotherapy, but developed uncontrolled sepsis and died in spite of clinical management and intensive care support. Cutaneous primary site of this malignancy in the scalp was previously neglected; therefore, neurological disturbances were the initial manifestations of melanoma.

40|$|Introduction. The {{consequences}} of autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (stem cells of hematopoiesis), applied in {{adults and children}} suffering from leukemia or some other malignant disease, are well-known and sufficiently recognizable in pediatric clinical practice regardless of the indication for the treatment. However, the efficacy of fetal stem cell transplantation is unrecognizable when the indications are psychomotor retardation and epilepsy. Case Outline. With the exception of neurological psychiatric problems, a boy aged 9. 5 years was in good general health before transplantation with allogeneic fetal stem cells. The main aim of allogeneic fetal stem cell transplantation was treatment of psychomotor retardation and epilepsy. After 13 months of treatment, he was admitted to hospital in a very serious, life-threatening condition due to sepsis and severe pleuropneumonia. The humoral immunity in the boy was adequate, unlike cellular immunity. The immune imbalance in terms of predominance of T-suppressor lymphocytes contributes to delayed and late development of sepsis and severe pleuropneumonia. The boy still shows the same severity of psychomotor retardation, <b>dyslalia,</b> epilepsy, strabismus and amblyopia. Conclusion. Implementation of fetal stem cell therapy for unconfirmed indications abuses the therapeutic approach, harms patients, misleads parents, and brings financial harm to the healthcare system of any country, including Serbia...|$|E
