5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> getting through {{a thick layer of}} fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E
5|$|Several years earlier, Alaska {{politicians}} had {{speculated that}} Gravel would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> getting both renominated and elected when {{his first term}} expired, given that he was originally elected without a base party organization and {{tended to focus on}} national rather than local issues.|$|E
5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> getting through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E

5|$|Cliff (Bill Cosby) {{comes home}} from a long day at work and tries to take a nap. Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe) {{disturbs}} him to say that Rudy's (Keshia Knight Pulliam) goldfish, Lamont, has died, {{but she does not}} realize it yet. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the older kids start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels {{that the rest of the}} family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she wants to say goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet.|$|E
5|$|General Buford {{recognized}} the importance of the high ground directly to the south of Gettysburg. He knew that if the Confederates could gain control of the heights, Meade's army would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> dislodging them. He decided to utilize three ridges west of Gettysburg: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge, and Seminary Ridge (proceeding west to east toward the town). These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town, Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. Early that morning, Reynolds, who was commanding the Left Wing of the Army of the Potomac, ordered his corps to march to Buford's location, with the XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) to follow closely behind.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E

5|$|On 21 May 1809, Napoleon {{crossed the}} Danube {{not far from}} Vienna and {{attacked}} Archduke Charles's Austrian army, situated on the northern bank of the river, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The French were nonetheless critically outnumbered and it soon became obvious that they would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> just holding out. Nansouty could only get one of his brigades, Saint-Germain's 3rd and 12th cuirassiers, across the Danube for the action on 21 May. He found the heroic cuirassiers of General Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne charging, as they had done all day long, in a desperate attempt to stop Austrian attacks on the thin French battle line. Espagne had just been killed in action and his exhausted and depleted squadrons needed to be relieved. Nansouty at once brought forward Saint-Germain's squadrons and charged the enemy infantry, allowing the army to maintain itself on the position.|$|E
5|$|The {{books are}} written in first-person narrative, {{primarily}} through Bella's eyes with the epilogue of the third book {{and a part of}} the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out there–Anne Rice's and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1994–1995 NBA season, Rodman {{clashed with the}} Spurs front office. He was suspended {{for the first three}} games, took a leave of absence on November 11, and was suspended again on December 7. He finally returned on December 10 after missing 19games. After joining the team, he suffered a shoulder separation in a motorcycle accident, limiting his season to 49games. Normally, he would not have qualified for any season records for missing so many games, but by grabbing 823 rebounds, he just surpassed the 800-rebound limit for listing players and won his fourth straight rebounding title by averaging 16.8 boards per game and made the All-NBA Team. In the 1995 NBA Playoffs, the 62-win Spurs with reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Award winner Robinson entered the Western Conference Finals and were considered favorites against the reigning champions Houston Rockets who had only won 47games. It was thought that Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> asserting himself versus Robinson and Rodman, who had both been voted into the NBA All-Defensive Teams. However, neither Robinson nor Rodman, who had disrupted a playoff game against the Lakers by sitting down on the court, could stop Olajuwon, who averaged 35.3points against the elite defensive Spurs frontcourt, and helped eliminate the Spurs in six games.|$|E

5|$|The {{first series}} begins {{nine months after}} the pilot episode. After Pete and Jenny's baby is born in Episode 1, the couple <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> getting any sleep. Pete has {{to cope with the}} death of his father in Episode 4. Adam and Rachel decide to rent a house together. He is horrified to {{discover}} in Episode 2 that she is married to another man. While he is staying with Pete and Jenny, Rachel has sex with her visiting husband (Lennie James)—who leaves soon after—and is pregnant by Episode 6. Just as hers and Adam's relationship is recovering, she tells him that he might not be the father, and that she is moving to London until the birth. Karen and David have recently hired Ramona as a nanny to their young son Josh. At her publishing job, Karen edits the novel of a renowned author (Denis Lawson), whom she becomes attracted to. She plans to sleep with him on a book tour but is humiliated when she finds out he is not attracted to her. David tries to sleep with Ramona to get back at Karen, which causes friction between the couple. They seek guidance counselling to repair their marriage.|$|E

A major problem has been that bacteria do not consume all parts of the malignant tissue. However, combining the therapy with chemotheraputic treatments can help to solve this problem.|$|E
