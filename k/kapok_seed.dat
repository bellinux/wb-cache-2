For this reason, 75 Ghanaian foods and 3 Malawian cereal flours were analyzed for Zn, Ca, Cu, and Mn by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP) was analyzed by the Englyst method, and phytic acid was analyzed using ion-exchange procedures; some foods were analyzed using the HPLC method. On a fresh weight basis (mg/ 100 g FW), legumes and animal products had the highest mineral content ranging from 1. 2 to 8. 5 (Zn), 49 to 4638 (Ca), 0. 15 to 1. 49 (Cu) and 0. 06 to 2. 67 (Mn), for animal products; and from 0. 4 to 6. 0 (Zn), 10 to 442 (Ca), 0. 08 to 1. 47 (Cu), and 0. 28 to 14. 12 (Mn) for legumes. In contrast, cereals had the lowest Ca and Cu content, ranging from 1. 3 to 16 and from 0. 01 to 0. 19 (mg/ 100 g FW), respectively; roots, tubers, plantain, and vegetables had the lowest Zn content (0. 1 - 0. 9 mg/ 100 g FW). The NSP content of groundnuts and bean cakes (mg/ 100 g FW), and the phytate content of cereals and legumes (g/ 100 g FW) were higher than those of other plant foods (for NSP, 5. 8 - 6. 3 vs 0. 2 - 4. 6 for other plant foods; and for phytate, 66 - 279 for cereals; and 118 - 339 for legumes vs 0 - 118 for other plant foods). For cereal flours, over 90 % of the inositol phosphates were inositol hexa- and pentaphosphates, compared to less than 65 % in the fermented cereal products. The molar ratios of phytate:Zn (P:Z) of the cereal staples and most of the starchy staples were similar despite the higher phytate content of the former (8 : 34; for cereals vs 4 : 24 for cassava products and yams). Hence, decreasing the proportion of cereals to starchy staples would probably not improve the bioavailability of Zn.

40|$|AbstractOne of the {{potential}} non-edible biodiesel feedstocks in Indonesia is <b>kapok</b> <b>seed</b> oil (Ceiba pentandra). However, the biodiesel made directly from <b>kapok</b> <b>seed</b> oil will not comply with the requirement of Indonesian Biodiesel Standard, because the oil contains cyclopropenoid group, i. e. a reactive group that easily polymerizes, making the biodiesel viscous and thus could plug the fuel injection nozzle on the diesel engine. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the suitable conditions for low T and P catalytic transfer hydrogenation process to eliminate the cyclopropenoid group in <b>kapok</b> <b>seed</b> oil. Potassium formate (10 M) was used as a hydrogen donor solution and the catalyst was a 5 %- palladium on carbon (5 %-Pd/C) utilized at a level of 0, 5 %-mass to oil. The concentrations of cyclopropenoid group at the beginning and the end of the hydrogenation were determined titrimetrically using Durbetaki reagent. The best condition for catalytic transfer hydrogenation of <b>kapok</b> <b>seed</b> oil found in this study was at 65 °C for 9 hours, which resulted in about 61 % decrease of the cyclopropenoid group.

However, advances in understanding about the problems faced by the developing embryo during incubation are still being made; and some may help "fine-tune " the incubation process.

Problems with hatchability usually can be traced to factors such as infertility, faulty breeder nutrition, disease status, or poor egg handling and hygiene, rather than to faulty incubation technique per se.

40|$|The kapok {{industry}} {{is full of}} potential because its fiber has {{a wide range of}} applications (furniture, apparel and automotive). Products made out of kapok have the potential to last for twenty years (kapok pillows and mattresses). To speed up the process of kapok fiber production, a group of diploma students from UTHM managed to develop a machine named as the <b>Kapok</b> <b>Seed</b> Separator. The machine is able to separate the <b>kapok</b> <b>seed</b> from its fiber in a shorter time compared to the traditional way. A prototype of this machine is favorable by many SMEs but the design can still be improved in order to enhance its manufacturability and assembly efficiency. In this research, the DFMA (Design for Manufacture and Assembly) was used to improve the design of the machine. As a result, the total manufacturing cost and assembly labor time were reduced by 28. 2 % and 42. 3 % respectively. The weight of the machine was also reduced by 30. 9 %. Moreover, the improved design of the machine is easier to be assembled because it has a higher DFA index. These results will aid the commercialization initiatives because the improved design will be cheaper to produce and maintain. Most importantly, the machine will be affordable to most SMEs and the throughput of these companies will improve significantl...|$|E

There were two treatment factors, namely : KSO supplementation as factor I, and KSO protection (throughout formation of Ca- salt after lipolysis by KOH) as factor II. Factor I consist of 4 supplementation levels, namely : 0 % (S 0); 5 % (S 1); 10 % (S 2), and 15 % (S 3), respectively, wheareas factor II consist of 5 protection levels, namely : 0 % (P 0); 25 % (P 1); 50 % (P 2); 75 % (P 3), and 100 % (P 4), repectivelly. Amount of 15 treatment combination were formed with control, namely without KSO supplementation and without protection (S 0 P 0). The measured variables included : relative proportion of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), i. e. : acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. In addition, the iodine number (IN) and relative proportion of long chain fatty acid (LCFA), i. e. : stearic acid and linoleic acid) omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acid) were also measured. Collected data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance with factorial treatment pattern in completely randomized design. The result of this investigation showed that supplementation 10 % or upper KSO without protection decreased asetis acid/propionic (A/P) ratio. Ratio of A/P tend increased again with protected KSO supplementation, but on 10 and 15 % supplementation levels still lower than control (1. 47 – 2. 99 vs 3. 36).
