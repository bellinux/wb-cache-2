5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to set foot on the Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
5|$|ACAs {{have three}} ports: the OTG port for the {{portable}} device, which {{is required to}} have a Micro-A plug on a captive cable; the accessory port, which is required to have a Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and the charging port, which is required to have a Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on a captive cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, but to the ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. The charging port does not pass data, but does use the D± signals for charging port detection. The accessory port acts as any other port. When appropriately signaled by the ACA, the portable device can charge from the bus power as <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> charging port present; any OTG signals over bus power are instead passed to the portable device via the ID signal. Bus power is also provided to the accessory port from the charging port transparently.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, {{also known}} as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65microteslas (0.25 to 0.65gauss). Roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> bar magnet placed at that angle {{at the center of the}} Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. Unlike a bar magnet, Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core).|$|E

5|$|Krips {{left the}} LSO in 1954, and the {{following}} year tensions between the orchestral principals and the rank-and-file players erupted into an irreconcilable dispute.

They also wished to be free to accept such engagements individually, absenting themselves from concerts <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> clash of dates. The LSO's board, which reflected the majority opinion of the players, refused to accommodate the principals, most of whom resigned en masse, to form the Sinfonia of London, a session ensemble that flourished from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, and then faded away. For fifteen years after the split the LSO did little film work, recording only six soundtracks between 1956 and 1971, compared with more than 70 films between 1940 and 1955.|$|E

25|$|However, this {{simplicity}} {{depends on}} the absence of deductions of any kind being allowed (or at least no variability in the deductions of different people). Furthermore, if income of differing types are segregated (e.g., pass-through, long term cap gains, regular income, etc.) then complications ensue. For example, if realized capital gains were subject to the flat tax, the law would require brokers and mutual funds to calculate the realized capital gain on all sales and redemption. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> gain, a tax equal to 15% {{of the amount of}} the gain would be withheld and sent to the IRS. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> loss, the amount would be reported to the IRS. The loss would offset gains, and then the IRS would settle up with taxpayers {{at the end of the}} period. Lacking deductions, this scheme cannot be used to implement economic and social policy indirectly by tax credits and thus, as noted above, the simplifications to the government's revenue collection apparatus might be offset by new government ministries required to administer those policies.|$|E

25|$|By {{looking at}} a {{cylindrical}} rod can one tell whether it is twisted? If the rod is perfectly cylindrical, then the circular symmetry of the cross section {{makes it impossible to}} tell {{whether or not it is}} twisted. However, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> straight line drawn along the length of the rod, then one could easily say whether or not there is a twist by looking at the state of the line. Drawing a line is gauge fixing. Drawing the line spoils the gauge symmetry, i.e., the circular symmetry U(1) of the cross section at each point of the rod. The line is the equivalent of a gauge function; it need not be straight. Almost any line is a valid gauge fixing, i.e., there is a large gauge freedom. To tell whether the rod is twisted, you need to first know the gauge. Physical quantities, such as the energy of the torsion, do not depend on the gauge, i.e., are gauge invariant.|$|E
25|$|Louis Shuster and Nicholas Dodman {{noticed that}} dogs often {{demonstrate}} obsessive and compulsive behaviors similar to humans. Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) {{is not only}} specific only to certain breeds of dogs, but the breed may affect the specific types of compulsions. For example, bull terriers frequently exhibit obsessively predatory or aggressive behaviors. Breed may factor into the types of compulsions, but some behaviors are more common across the canine spectrum. Most commonly, CCD is seen in canines as they repeat behaviors such as chasing their tails, compulsively chewing on objects, or licking their paws excessively, similar to the common hand-washing compulsion many people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder have. Hallucinating and attacking the air around their head, as <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> bug there, is another compulsion that has been seen in some dogs. Circling, hair biting, staring, and sometimes even barking are other examples of behaviors that are considered compulsions in dogs when taken to extreme, repetitive actions.|$|E
25|$|The {{committee}} then submitted {{an updated}} version of the designation amendment to the House on October 23 that changed the number of candidates in a contingency election from five to three and allowed the Senate to choose the Vice President <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> tie in that race. Small Federalist states disliked the change from five to three, because it made it far less likely that a small-state candidate would make it to a contingency election. Huger and New York Federalist Gaylord Griswold argued that the Constitution was a compromise between large and small states and the method chosen by the Framers is supposed to check the influence of the larger states. Huger even asserted that the Constitution itself was not a union of people, but a union of large and small states in order to justify the original framework for electing the President. Designation, argued Griswold and Huger, would violate the spirit of the Constitution by taking away a check on the power of the large states.|$|E

25|$|Exchange {{interactions}} {{occur when}} the substance is not magnetically dilute and there are interactions between individual magnetic centres. One of the simplest systems to exhibit the result of exchange interactions is crystalline copper(II) acetate, Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2. As the formula indicates, it contains two copper(II) ions. The Cu2+ ions are held together by four acetate ligands, each of which binds to both copper ions. Each Cu2+ ion has a d9 electronic configuration, and so should have one unpaired electron. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> covalent bond between the copper ions, the electrons would pair up and the compound would be diamagnetic. Instead, there is an exchange interaction in which the spins of the unpaired electrons become partially aligned to each other. In fact two states are created, one with spins parallel {{and the other with}} spins opposed. The energy difference between the two states is so small their populations vary significantly with temperature. In consequence the magnetic moment varies with temperature in a sigmoidal pattern. The state with spins opposed has lower energy, so the interaction can be classed as antiferromagnetic in this case. It is believed that {{this is an example of}} superexchange, mediated by the oxygen and carbon atoms of the acetate ligands. Other dimers and clusters exhibit exchange behaviour.|$|E
