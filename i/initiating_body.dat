40|$|Obesity is an {{increasing}} health concern in modern society and in order {{for this to be}} successfully addressed there is a demand for a greater understanding of natural long term control of body weight and energy balance. The Siberian hamster provides a model of seasonal weight and energy regulation. Hamsters were studied under either long-day (LD) conditions (8 hours dark: 16 hours light) to promote weight gain, or short-day (SD) photoperiod (16 hours dark: 8 hours light) to induce weight loss. Weight loss in SD can be as much as 40 % and identification of the factors involved in initiation and regulation of this weight loss may provide key understanding of long term weight control that could be applied to the treatment of obesity. Chronic central thyroid hormone administration resulted in body weight gain and reversed the catabolic effects of SD, while also reducing the incidence of energy saving torpor bouts, thereby promoting a LD, relatively fat phenotype. Further studies demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF 21) also plays a role in regulating body weight. Continuous peripheral administration of FGF 21 triggered weight loss and increased utilisation of fat stores, promoting a SD relatively lean phenotype. Interestingly, these effects of FGF 21 were found to be greatest in LD hamsters which initially had larger fat reserves and overall body weight and only slight effects were seen on lean SD hamsters. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate potential mechanisms for the natural photoperiodic regulation of body weight and energy metabolism observed in the Siberian hamster in order to identify novel factors involved in long term weight control. These studies suggest that the initial energy status of the hamster is important for determining the response to weight altering interventions. They also suggest that central thyroid hormone may be a key factor <b>initiating</b> <b>body</b> weight gain in the transition from SD to LD, but that peripheral signals such as FGF 21 are perhaps equally important for maintaining long term energy balance.

40|$|In crustaceans, the {{presence}} of large males with highly developed prehensile appendages (chelipeds or gnathopods) generally is suggestive of female monopolization during her receptive period. While mate guarding is common among some malacostracan crustaceans (brachyuran crabs and some amphipod families) it is relatively rare in caridean shrimp. Here we explored sexual dimorphism and {{the presence}} of morphotypic differences among males of the dancing shrimp Rhynchocinetes brucei. We furthermore quantified the behavioral events during mating interactions to examine whether mate guarding extends over the entire period of female receptivity. Males and females had similar body sizes, but males developed increasingly larger third maxillipeds and first chelipeds during ontogeny. Large males with hyperdeveloped maxillipeds and very large chelipeds featured a high degree of broken appendages and eyes, which probably results from intrasexual agonistic interactions. About 30 % of the non-competitive male-female interactions with post-ovigerous females resulted in successful matings. Males usually <b>initiated</b> <b>body</b> contact with the female shortly after the female's parturial molt, and they frequently touched the female's genital region with their anterior body parts. The first (and in most cases only) spermatophore transfer event occurred at variable times (0. 2 - 7 h) after the female's molt. Following spermatophore transfer some males guarded the female in the cage state (between their pereiopods) until the female had finished spawning and was ovigerous. Post-copulatory mate guarding could last up to 70 min, but not all males guarded the female after the copulation. We suggest that male guarding of the receptive female throughout the mating process reduces the risk of sperm competition. © 2010 The Crustacean Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the adoption of environmental bodies in two English counties is based theoretically upon an industrial interpretation of suitable environmental protection measures for the municipal waste management sector, and empirically upon a survey of waste disposal contractors in the case study regions. The Government is actively attempting to shift the emphasis of municipal waste management further up its hierarchy of waste options, so that the industry's dependence upon an ever diminishing landfill resource is reduced. In the wake of recycling targets, recycling credits, minimisation trials and general waste related policy and legislation, the Government has enforced the landfill tax, to artificially raise the cost of landfill. However, of perhaps greater significance than the tax, are the associated environmental bodies which {{can be set up}} to reclaim up to 20 % of the disposal company's landfill tax payments, to be used for the initiation of local environmental improvement schemes. There is great scope for the use of landfill tax credits, for the reclamation and restoration of land, pollution reduction schemes, the restoration of historical and religious buildings, and most importantly for research and education programmes. The awareness of the potential of these bodies in providing positive local environmental improvement is assessed by focusing upon their adoption by, and the involvement of, private sector landfill operators in the counties of Northampton and Surrey. Environmental bodies are currently being viewed warily by the industry, with little firm commitment to <b>initiate</b> <b>bodies</b> or provide funding for existing bodies. However, the results do suggest that the bodies, which are currently being set up in isolation from the landfill operators. will eventually be successful in attracting funding from landfill operators, providing an important source of funding for local environmental initiatives...|$|R

40|$|SummaryLocal infections {{can trigger}} immune {{responses}} in distant organs, and this interorgan immunological crosstalk helps maintain immune homeostasis. We find that enterobacterial infection or chemically and genetically stimulating {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) -induced stress responses in the Drosophila gut triggers global antimicrobial peptide (AMP) responses in the fat body, a major immune organ in flies. ROS stress induces nitric oxide (NO) production in the gut, which triggers production of the AMP Diptericin, but not Drosomycin, in the fat body. Hemocytes serve as a signaling relay for communication between intestinal ROS/NO signaling and fat body AMP responses. The induction of AMP responses requires Rel/NF-κB activation within the fat body. Although Rel-mediated Drosomycin induction is repressed by the AP- 1 transcription factor, this repressor activity is inhibited by intestinal ROS. Thus, intestinal ROS signaling {{plays an important role}} in <b>initiating</b> gut-to-fat <b>body</b> immunological communication in Drosophila...|$|R
