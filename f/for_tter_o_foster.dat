It is well acknowledged that assessment methods have a greater influence on how and what students learn than any other single factor and so it is crucial that they are developed to foster learning of desired outcomes rather than to purely grade student achievement. This presentation will explore how assessment can be designed to complete a circle of quality assurance. That is, assessment is utilised as a "research instrument" by which the educator learns what their students are NOT learning, which then drives change.

The conventional processing pipeline of object tracking methods performs the segmentation and tracking modules consecutively.

We present a new approach in which segmentation and tracking modules profit from each other to resolve ambiguities in complex dynamic scenes. A non-parametric Bayesian method, the sequential distance dependent Chinese Restaurant Process (s-ddCRP), enables us to combine segmentation and tracking components. After a pre-processing step which maps measurements to a grid representation, the proposed method tracks each grid cell and segments the environment in an integrated way.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to {{the dynamics of the}} universe based on work by <b>Ó</b> Murchadha, <b>Foster,</b> Anderson and the author is presented. The only kinematics presupposed is the spatial geometry needed to define configuration spaces in purely relational terms. A new formulation of the relativity principle based on Poincaré’s analysis of the problem of absolute and relative motion (Mach’s principle) is given. The entire dynamics is based on shape and nothing else. It leads to much stronger predictions than standard Newtonian theory. For the dynamics of Riemannian 3 -geometries on which matter fields also evolve, implementation of the new relativity principle establishes unexpected links between special relativity, general relativity and the gauge principle. They all emerge together as a self-consistent complex from a unified and completely relational approach to dynamics. A connection between time and scale invariance is established. In particular, the representation of general relativity as evolution of the shape of space leads to a unique dynamical definition of simultaneity. This opens up the prospect of a solution of the problem of time in quantum gravity {{on the basis of a}} fundamental dynamical principle. Electronic address:...|$|R

This study presents the potential for Carbon sequestration in RMS developing on 3 post sur- face mining areas in Poland (Central Europe) reforested with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L). Research was conducted on waste heaps and quarry which accompany open cast lignite, sul- fur, and sand mining. Control plots were arrang- ed in managed pine forests on natural sites in the surrounding area. The results shows high Carbon accumulation in RMS, estimated on 16. 77 Mg?ha- 1 in poor (oligotrofic) soils on Quaternary sands on sand quarry and up to 65. 03 Mg?ha- 1 on external waste heap after Sulfur sur- face mining exploitation on Quaternary sands mixed with Tertiary clays. These results were very similar to natural forest soils on control plots. Potential rate of Carbon sequestration in RMS was estimated on 0. 73 (on the poorest sa- ndy soils on quarry) to 2. 17 Mg?ha- 1 ?yr- 1 (on potentially abundant sandy-clayish soils on Sulfur waste heap), and 5. 26 Mg?ha- 1 ?yr- 1 (on Tertiary sands substrate soils on lignite mining waste heap). In conslusion the average Carbon accu- mulation in RMS was estimated on 41 Mg?ha- 1 and Carbon sequestration rate was 1. 45 Mg? ha- 1 ?yr- 1. According to {{the result of this}} study and range of post-mining areas reclaimed to forestry in Poland (ca 15000 ha) total Carbon accumulation in RMS was estimated on 615 × 103 Mg and potential Carbon sequestration rate in new ecosystems on 21. 75 × 103 Mg?ha- 1 ?yr- 1.

The ABW concept removes designated desks but o ers di erent work settings designed to support typical work activities. In this context {{there is still}} a need for objective data to understand the implications of these design decisions. We aim to contribute by using automated data collection to study how ABW’s principles impact o ce usage and dynamics. To this aim we analyse team dynamics and employees’ tie strength in relation to space usage and organisational hierarchy using data collected with wearable devices in a company adopting ABW principles. Our ndings show that the <b>o</b> ce <b>fosters</b> interactions across team boundaries and among the lower levels of the hierarchy suggesting a strong lateral communication. Employees also tend to have low space exploration on a daily basis which is instead more prevalent during an average week and strong social clusters seem to be resisting the ABW principles of space dynamics. With the availability of two additional data sets about social encounters in traditional o ces we highlight traits emerging from the application of ABW’s principles. In particular, we observe how the absence of designated desks might be responsible for more rapid dynamics inside the o ce. In more general terms, this work opens the door to new and scalable technology-based methodologies to study dynamic o ce usage and social interactions. EPSRC and Qualcom...|$|R

Generally speaking, control allocation is any method that is used to determine how the controls of a system should be positioned to achieve some desired effect. An infinite number of allocation methods exist, from the straight-forward direct allocation technique, to the daisy chaining approach, to the computationally simple generalized inverse method. Because different methods have advantages and disadvantages with respect to others, the determination of the “optimal ” control allocation method is left to the system designer. The many tradeoffs that are addressed during control system design, of which control allocation is an integral part, dictate the need for a reliable, computer-based design tool. The Control Allocation Toolbox for MATLAB® satisfies such a need by providing the designer with a means of testing/comparing the validity of certain allocation methods under prescribed conditions.

I argue that the 3 -space approach is a viable description of classical physics (fundamental matter fields included), and one which affords considerable philosophical insight because of its ‘relationalist’ character. From these assumptions of less structure, it is also interesting that conventional relativity can be recovered (albeit as one of several options). However, contrary to speculation in the earlier 3 -space approach papers, I also argue that this approach is not selective over which sorts of fundamental matter physics it admits.

40|$|Internalization of sociocultural norms {{about the}} body has been theorized to be an {{important}} factor in fostering body dissatisfaction in women. Some theorists have suggested that a lesbian identity may buffer or immunize lesbians from the damaging effects of society’s pressure to be thin by reducing this internalization. This study was designed to test this claim empirically, Questionnaires were completed by 108 lesbians and 1 15 heterosexual women recruited through snowball sampling. Lesbians felt more fit, reported less negative attitudes toward their lower bodies, and internalized sociocultural norms less than heterosexual women. For all women, internalization of sociocultural norms significantly predicted body attitudes. Lesbians and heterosexual women appear to be similarly exposed to and aware of society‘s messages, and as such their body attitudes substantially overlap. However, lesbians are buffered from these views in some specific areas. These differences appear to be primarily the result of differential internalization of sociocultural norms. Negative body image has become pervasive among women in Western society. Research has consistently confirmed that women are more dissatisfied with their bodies than are men (Brand, Rothblum, & Solomon, 1992; Thompson & Psaltis, 1988).

40|$|How {{does our}} brain work? Understanding how the sensory {{information}} is being processed in the ¨brain and generates behaviors {{is one of}} the great est challenges of science in our century. Ac tivity of single neurons have been investigated in ¨great detail. However, neurons do not work in iso lation. They are organized in circuits that proces s key information to perform higher brain fun ctions. In order to understand these brain ci rcuits the use of functional imaging has been ¨established as an excellent tool for monitoring n etwork activity with high spatial and tempora l resolution. Therefore, during the first par t of my thesis, I developed a framework of al gorithms to extract relevant information from func tional imaging in order to understand the activity ¨of thousands of neurons. The second a im of this thesis is to study neuronal coding, how ¨neurons process sensory information and react to¨ external stimuli. As means to achieve that aim, I¨ selected to study the gustatory system, a well-def ined and simple sensory system which coding strate gies are still a matter of debate. In order¨ to study the neural mechanisms inherent to gustato ry information processing, I focused on the brains tem, the first relay of taste processing in the ce ntral nervous system. Brainstem circuits are a ver y attractive system for studying the basic computa tions underlying simple reflex motor outputs. More over, in the particular organization of the zebraf ish, this circuits are rather accessible. My ¨results showed that taste categories (sweet, sour, bitter, salt and umami) are represented by dissi milar brainstem responses and generate different b ehaviors. I also showed that the intensity percept ion of different categories is encoded by differen t principles. On the other hand, the food we ¨consume is a combination of different tastants fr om different categories. Then, how does the b rainstem cope with such mixtures? I observed that¨ taste mixtures generates nonlinearities in th e activity of the brainstem circuits that may suggest the presence of complex coding mechanisms such as dynamic gain modulation and neural a ttractors. These mechanisms might be used <b>for</b> a be <b>tter</b> food detection or more efficient rejecti on of inedible substances.

In Poland, circumstances that favor intensive N 2 O emissions from the arable soils occur uncommonly, as shows {{the analysis of the}} literature reporting on the country climate, soil and agricultural conditions alongside the N 2 O emissions from soils under various cultivation conditions. Consequently, the effectiveness of mitigation practices that relies on an extensification of plant production may be insufficient. It can be assumed that, at the doses of nitrogen fitting the nutritional needs of crops, the soil N 2 O emissions are low and do not meaningfully differ from the emissions from untreated soils (literature data point to limited N 2 O emission from arable soils treated with N doses of ≤ 150 - 200 kg N·ha- 1). The effectiveness of the nitrogen fertilization reduction as an N 2 O emissions mitigation practice is restricted to intensive farming. A universal registry of the mineral and natural fertilization use could help identify the agricultural holdings with a potential for high N 2 <b>O</b> emission and <b>foster</b> a targeted application of mitigation practices. It is suggested that normalization and maintenance of the optimum (i. e. close to neutral) soil pH should become a more common practice of N 2 O emissions mitigation in Poland in view of the extent of arable soils acidification and the literature data that indicate elevated N 2 O emissions from acid soils. Application of urease and nitrification inhibitors alongside nitrogen fertilization can be considered an effective practice of N 2 O emissions mitigation. Owing to economic reasons the use of nitrogen fertilizers with such additives is currently limited to non-agricultural segments of plant production. Afforestation of the low productive soils offers an attractive opportunity for mitigation of N 2 O emissions. Whereas N 2 O emissions from forest soils are considerably lower compared with those from the arable ones, the literature indicates that no N 2 O emissions mitigation is attained through a conversion of arable land to agroforestry. Considering the current forest area of Poland (24. 9 % of the total area) and the plans to increase the afforestation rate (to 33 % in 2050) the measurable effects of this mitigation practice will only be seen in a long-term perspective...|$|R

40|$|We {{conclude}} {{that there are}} three advantages in promoting the ‘intergenerational’ dimension in social dialogue and collective bargaining: o It strengthens awareness of the specific labour market positions and needs of both younger and older workers. o It supports social partners’ role in unifying generations of workers - also as a response to public opinion and the risk of ‘generational conflicts’ or age related outsiderness in the labour market and in employment relations. <b>o</b> It <b>fosters</b> ‘positive-sum’ bargaining by combining and interlinking age related capacities, knowledge and skills and integrated approaches in lifecycle policies (from school-to-work transitions to retirement transition, and all working life phases in between). This project has resulted in {{a better understanding of the}} social partners’ reasons to strive for a better integration of the policies and strategies for younger and older workers through collective bargaining and social dialogue. The social partners’ opportunities to improve the labour market and employment situation and working conditions for both groups are dependent on the national contexts of industrial relations systems, such as the cooperative structures between governments and collective bargaining parties and the scope of dialogue and bargaining between employers and trade unions (especially where the integration of issues of the quality of employment, training and education, health and working conditions is concerned). This research project has also shown that the Europe-wide crisis has been an enabling factor in promoting intergenerational or age related public policies, although they did not emerge immediately when the crisis started: the bigger public initiatives in the country reports were implemented several years after the onset of the crisis: the French Contrat de génération was implemented in 2012 and the Dutch Generatiepact in 2013. Both public programmes reinforced the governmental approach of not using early retirement schemes for older workers as a policy instrument in solving the problem of youth unemployment (the main intergenerational ‘trade-off’ during the last three decades of the 20 th century). We expect continuing political and public attention to the employment participation of both groups, because of the risk that the workers at the beginning as well as at the end of the working lives run to be used as ‘adjustment’ variables in flexible labour markets. The research results indeed suggest that the old intergenerational ‘trade-off’ - that is, redistributing employment from the older to the newer generations of workers - has disappeared as an important topic in collective bargaining. At the same time, however, the labour market and company practices in some sectors of industry can push for, or generate, a redistribution of jobs towards cheaper or more recently educated workers, for example in the retail industry (in which the labour market is more constituted as a ‘lump sum’), the IT sector (in which the older workers’ skills risk becoming obsolete) or in physically demanding workplaces. More tailor-made collective bargaining on investments in skills, health, task differentiation and cross-sector job-to-job policies are needed to prevent unemployment and sickness in later working life phases. For some groups, however, we expect in both the short and the longer run that the social partners in Europe will increase their bargaining activities on the issue of part-time work and flexible and gradual retirement among older workers. These negotiations will deal with regulating compensation for income loss and the needs of older workers themselves, although cost reduction of senior workers’ labour costs will also play a role. The take up of these reduced working hours of the older workers by younger workers can be directly or indirectly addressed in collective bargaining. The relevant case studies in this project (in particular Italy and the Netherlands) have taught us that combining part-time retirement for older workers with new jobs for youths can be both enabled or hindered by the financial compensation for the older worker. A remarkable finding in this project is that the social partners in all countries (with the possible exception of the UK) have intensified their debates - and sometimes initiated regulations - on the topic of intergeneration transfers of knowledge and skills by involving older workers as mentors, coaches, trainers or instructors for young workers at workplaces, vocational education organizations or in other school-to-work trajectories. Reserving these kinds of tasks for workers in the final phase of their working careers is a valuable option to enable longer working careers for older workers, knowledge management in organizations, and recognizing and appreciating the skills, insights and values of experienced workers (see also Cedefop, 2009; Delay et al., 2011; Jubany et al., 2014). Coordination through collective bargaining and the involvement of trade unions can have a supporting and promoting function for these kind of innovations at the workplace, as we have seen in France, Germany and the Netherlands. We can also {{conclude that}} the collective bargaining parties in most of the case studies seem not to refer to frames and concepts on ‘intergenerational solidarity’, or to ‘intergenerational conflicts’, when discussing or negotiating age related employment or working conditions. Social partners in many case studies address the specific, work related needs of both younger and older workers, without bargaining on intergenerational ‘trade-offs’. This can be done through approaches targeting specific age groups in labour market policies and in collective agreements (Sweden, Netherlands, France, Germany), or through an approach in which the needs and interests of youths or older workers are addressed in age neutral, general regulations (UK). Nevertheless, some tensions between age groups are signalled in some of the country reports, for example regarding the negotiations on the austerity measures in older workers’ provisions and their conversion into new provisions for workers in all working career phases in the Netherlands. In this case we have seen negotiations along the intergenerational redistributive logic that does not concern employment but a distribution of terms and conditions of employment. Another complex case dealing with intergenerational solidarity is that of the debates in German firms about age group related priorities in HR policies and the related distributive decisions in the context of the demography related funds and framework agreements. These tensions and dialogues between generations of workers can be better moderated when young workers are more organized by trade unions and when they are given a stronger voice in trade unions’ decisions and actions. Intergenerational bargaining approaches and activities are challenged by the ageing memberships of trade unions in Europe (Keune, 2015). Vandaele (2012) concludes that youth representatives across Europe find their confederations’ responsiveness and commitment to organizing younger workers inadequate. Trade unions are only to a limited extent adapting their internal policies and strategies to support young people and engage the new generation of workers in their activities and decision-making structures. Besides the more targeted logic of organizing intergenerational learning in collective bargaining, and the more political dependent logic of public employment policies for youth and older workers, we think that bargaining along the lifecycle logic is a promising approach in collective bargaining, because of its ambition and ability to respond to - and to anticipate - the specific and changing needs of workers in work-life phases and during their careers, from the school-to-work transition to the work-retirement transition. Such an approach can include topics on the quality of work and employment, health issues, training, job design or redesign, and work-life balance to foster an improved labour market inclusion of youth workers and higher quality working career extensions for older workers. The biggest challenge in this approach is to extend it to workers in less organized sectors and to those with less stable career patterns...|$|R
