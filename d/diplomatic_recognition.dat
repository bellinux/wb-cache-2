5|$|During the Civil War, the Union and Russia were allies {{against what}} they saw as their {{potential}} enemy, Britain. The Russian blue-water navy was stationed in San Francisco and from 1863 in New York—with sealed orders to attack British naval targets in case war broke out between the United States and Britain. This was threatened if Britain gave <b>diplomatic</b> <b>recognition</b> to the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, as the {{intensity}} of the fighting increased, Croatia won its first <b>diplomatic</b> <b>recognition</b> by a western nation—Iceland—while the Serbian Autonomous Oblasts in Krajina and western Slavonia officially declared themselves the Republic of Serbian Krajina. Four days later, Germany recognized Croatian independence. On December 26, 1991, the Serb-dominated federal presidency announced plans for a smaller Yugoslavia that could include the territory captured from Croatia during the war.|$|E
5|$|The atrocities {{prompted}} Germany {{to grant}} Croatia <b>diplomatic</b> <b>recognition</b> in mid-November. It overcame {{opposition to the}} move from the United Kingdom, France and the United States by late December, and formally recognized Croatia on 23 December 1991. The German decision was followed by recognition from other EC member states on 15 January 1992. The Croatian Serbs in turn declared {{the establishment of the}} Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) on 21 December 1991 in JNA-held areas comprising approximately 30% of Croatian territory. The RSK was entirely dependent on Serbia economically and financially.|$|E

5|$|After the attack, the non-Serb {{civilian}} {{population in the}} village and the surrounding area was persecuted. They were forced to flee their homes, as they would have been imprisoned, physically abused or killed if they did not. After the war, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) charged high-ranking SAO SBWS and Serbian officials, including Slobodan Milošević and Goran Hadžić, with war crimes committed in Dalj. The killings were extensively covered by German media leading to forming of a public opinion in support of Croatia. By the end of 1991, Germany adopted support for <b>diplomatic</b> <b>recognition</b> of Croatia as its policy and duty.|$|E
5|$|In November 1991 Croatia, Serbia and the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) {{agreed upon}} the Vance plan, {{designed}} to halt combat {{operations in the}} Croatian War of Independence and allow the negotiation of a political settlement. In addition to the ceasefire, the plan protected civilians in specific areas—designated as United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs)—and UN peacekeepers in Croatia.

50|$|Transport in Kosovo is {{complicated}} by political issues relating to international recognition. The country declared Independence in 2008 from Serbia. It currently has 110 <b>diplomatic</b> <b>recognitions,</b> of which 108 {{are members of the}} United Nations. Transport links to the north are fractured as Serbia does not recognise Kosovo's independence. Kosovo is recognised as sovereign by all other countries with which it shares a border.

UN Security Council Resolution 242, which called for normalization of Israel with the Arab states and for Israel to give up territories taken during the war, was enacted on November 22, 1967 and faced initial rejection by most of the Arab world. The peace initiative, according to Oxford Research Group, represents a total break from this past.|$|R
25|$|After the KMT's {{retreat to}} Taiwan, most {{countries}}, notably {{the countries in}} the Western Bloc, continued to maintain relations with the ROC.

5|$|On 8 October, Croatia {{declared}} {{independence from}} Yugoslavia, {{and a month}} later the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska - HV). The fiercest fighting of the war occurred around this time, when the 1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia culminated in the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar. In November, Croatia, Serbia and the JNA agreed upon the Vance plan entailing a ceasefire, protection of civilians in specific areas designated as United Nations Protected Areas, {{and the presence of}} UN peacekeepers in Croatia.

In late 1991, the Commission stated, among other things, that Yugoslavia {{was in the process of}} dissolution, and that the internal boundaries of Yugoslav republics could not be altered unless freely agreed upon. Factors in the preservation of Croatia's pre-war borders, defined by demarcation commissions in 1947, were the Yugoslav federal constitutional amendments of 1971 and 1974, granting that sovereign rights were exercised by the federal units, and that the federation had only the authority specifically transferred to it by the constitution.|$|E
5|$|The signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania {{were the}} twenty Lithuanian men {{who signed the}} Act of Independence of Lithuania on February 16, 1918.

The proclaimed independence was established only in late 1918, after Germany lost World War I and its troops retreated from Lithuanian territory. What followed was a long process of building the state, determining its borders, and gaining international <b>diplomatic</b> <b>recognition.</b> The signatories succeeded in their mission and independent Lithuania survived until the Soviet Union occupied the state on June 15, 1940.|$|E

2500|$|Because of anti-communist {{sentiment}} at {{the start}} of the Cold War, the Republic of China was recognized as the sole legitimate government of China by the United Nations and most Western nations. On 9 January 1950, the Israeli government extended recognition to the People's Republic of China. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 505, passed on 1 February 1952 considered the Chinese communists to be rebels against the Republic of China. However, the 1970s saw a switch in <b>diplomatic</b> <b>recognitions</b> from the ROC to the PRC. On 25 October 1971, Resolution 2758 was passed by the UN General Assembly, which [...] "decides to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it." [...] It should be noted that the Resolution 2758 merely dealt with the issue of Chinese representative in UN without any reference to the legal status of Taiwan. Multiple attempts by the Republic of China to rejoin the UN, no longer to represent all of China but just the people of the territories it governs, have not made it past committee, largely due to diplomatic maneuvering by the PRC, which claims Resolution 2758 has settled the matter.

5|$|After the Khmer Republic {{fell to the}} Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975, a {{new regime}} under its charge, Democratic Kampuchea, was formed.

In September 1975, Sihanouk briefly returned to Cambodia to inter the ashes of his mother, before going abroad again to lobby for <b>diplomatic</b> <b>recognition</b> of Democratic Kampuchea. He returned on 31December 1975 and presided over a meeting to endorse the constitution of Democratic Kampuchea. In February 1976 Khieu Samphan took him on a tour across the Cambodian countryside. Sihanouk {{was shocked to see}} the use of forced labour and population displacement carried out by the Khmer Rouge government, known as the Angkar. Following the tour, Sihanouk decided to resign as the Head of State. The Angkar initially rejected his resignation request, though they subsequently accepted it in mid-April 1976, retroactively backdating it to 2April 1976.|$|E
5|$|Croatia held an {{independence}} {{referendum on}} 19 May 1991, following the Croatian parliamentary elections of 1990 {{and the rise}} of ethnic tensions that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. With 83 percent turnout, voters approved the referendum, with 93 percent in favor of independence. Subsequently, Croatia declared independence and the dissolution of its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991, but it introduced a three-month moratorium on the decision when urged to do so by the European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe through the Brioni Agreement. The war in Croatia escalated during the moratorium, and on 8 October 1991, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. In 1992, the countries of the European Economic Community granted Croatia <b>diplomatic</b> <b>recognition</b> and Croatia was admitted to the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Grant was {{urged by}} popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with {{military}} assistance {{and to give}} them U.S. <b>diplomatic</b> <b>recognition.</b> Grant and Fish instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating. Grant and Fish wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery without U.S. military intervention or occupation. Fish, diligently and against popular pressure, {{was able to keep}} Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims. The Sickle's peace negotiations failed in Madrid, but Grant and Fish did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion. Grant and Fish sent a message to Congress, written by Fish and signed by Grant. The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt, calming national fears.|$|E

40|$|To {{the parties}} and lower courts, Zivotofsky v. Kerry has been a dispute {{primarily}} {{about the nature of}} the President 2 ̆ 7 s power to recognize foreign borders. But what if the law also raises another, entirely separate issue under Article II? This essay explores the possibility that Section 214 (d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2003 is unconstitutional not because it recognizes a border or materially interferes with the implementation of U. S. recognition policy, but simply because it purports to compel diplomatic speech that the President opposes. From this angle, Zivotofsky presents a question about who controls official <b>diplomatic</b> communications, and <b>recognition</b> is beside the point...|$|R
5|$|Kalonji went {{to great}} lengths to secure {{international}} recognition and support for the state of South Kasai. The former colonial power, Belgium, distrusted the Congolese central government and supported both the governments of South Kasai and Katanga. Like Katanga, South Kasai had important mineral deposits, including diamond fields, and Belgian companies had large sums of money tied up in mines in the area. A Belgian company, , was the state's principal supporter and received concessions from South Kasai in exchange for financial support. The comparatively large income from these companies meant that South Kasai was able to support significant public services and cope with large numbers of internally-displaced Luba refugees. In the context of the Cold War, Kalonji was supported by Western powers and moderates in the Congolese government who viewed him as both a moderate pro-Westerner and anticommunist. Although both Katanga and South Kasai were supported by South Africa, France and the Central African Federation, neither state ever received any form of official <b>diplomatic</b> <b>recognition.</b>|$|E

The leader of the Ustaše, Ante Pavelić, was in Rome at the time and made arrangements to travel to Karlovac, just west of Zagreb. He arrived in Karlovac on 13 April, accompanied by 250–400 of his followers.

That same day, Germany and Italy extended <b>diplomatic</b> <b>recognition</b> to the NDH.

50|$|Since {{they both}} {{achieved}} independence in 1948, Burma and North Korea have enjoyed a chequered relationship.

Consular links with both states were established in 1961 and full diplomatic relations followed in 1975. During the 1960s and 1970s, General Ne Win’s government made efforts to balance the competing demands of North Korea and South Korea for <b>recognition,</b> <b>diplomatic</b> support and trade.

5|$|On 23 June 1991, as Slovenia and Croatia {{prepared}} to declare their independence during {{the breakup of}} Yugoslavia, the European Community (EC) foreign ministers decided the EC member states would not extend <b>diplomatic</b> <b>recognition</b> to the two states.
