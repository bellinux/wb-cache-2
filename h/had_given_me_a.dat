Though it was unnecessary from a practical standpoint, Evita set aside many hours per day to meet with the poor who requested help from her foundation. During these meetings with the poor, Evita often kissed the poor and allowed them to kiss her. Evita was even witnessed placing her hands in the suppurated wounds of the sick and poor, touching the leprous, and kissing the syphilitic. Fraser and Navarro write that though Argentina is secular in many respects, it is essentially a Catholic country. Therefore, when Evita kissed the syphilitic and touched the leprous she [...] "...ceased to be the President's wife and acquired some of the characteristics of saints depicted in Catholicism." [...] Poet , a man from a wealthy background, reflected on the times he witnessed Evita meeting with the poor: [...] "I had had a sort of literary perception of the people and the poor and she <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> Christian one, thus allowing me to become a Christian in the profoundest sense...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brown later {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with}} Life Against Death, referring to its chapter on [...] "Language and Eros" [...] as [...] "quite immature." [...] He {{observed that the}} book, [...] "records the first revision of my historical identity, from Marx to Marx and Freud", a process which occurred because his first [...] "historical identity", Marxism, had been [...] "wrecked in the frozen landscapes of the Cold War, {{the defeat of the}} simplistic hopes for a better world that inspired the Henry Wallace campaign for the Presidency in 1948." [...] Brown, who saw Louis Zukofsky's poetry as anticipating the ideas of both Life Against Death and Love's Body (1966), has called Life Against Death [...] "my first exuberant surge of premature post-Marxist energy", writing that in it he had wagered his [...] "intellectual life on the idea of finding in Freud what was missing in Marx." [...] Brown [...] "found in Freud's analysis of the pathological dimension of human desires the basis for a post-Marxist critique of capitalism." [...] Commenting on his intellectual development, Brown noted that, [...] "My Marxist background <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> healthy prejudice against moneymaking. Imagine my excitement when I discovered Sandor Ferenczi's article 'The Ontogenesis of the Interest in Money'; with its immortal conclusion, 'After what has been said money is seen to be nothing other than deodorized, dehydrated shit that has been made to shine.'" ...|$|E

60|$|Ah! the {{sedative}} {{had been}} administered. In fact, they <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> strong opiate. I {{was to be}} held quiet for one night.|$|E
60|$|Still, regret, albeit {{an admirable}} sentiment, was one whose {{existence}} was usually brief in my bosom. Dame! Had I {{been a man}} of regrets I might have spent the remainder of my days weeping over my past life. But the gods, who <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> character calculated to lead a man into misfortune, <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> stout heart wherewith to fight that misfortune, and an armour of recklessness against which remorse, regrets, aye, and conscience itself, rained blows in vain.|$|E
