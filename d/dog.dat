5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White <b>Dog</b> focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd <b>dog</b> who comes back to their home with one of their other dogs. At first, the <b>dog,</b> which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that the <b>dog,</b> a former Alabama police <b>dog,</b> was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the <b>dog</b> is {{too old to be}} retrained, they take him to a black <b>dog</b> trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the <b>dog</b> to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed the ending of the American version to be more optimistic.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dogs</b> with {{liver disease}} {{have been shown}} to have {{increased}} serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. However, it is unclear whether <b>dogs</b> with liver disease also have increased serum haptoglobin concentrations. The aim {{of the study was to}} measure serum haptoglobin concentrations in healthy <b>dogs,</b> hospitalised <b>dogs</b> and <b>dogs</b> with liver diseases. Haptoglobin concentrations were measured in 30 healthy <b>dogs,</b> 47 hospitalised <b>dogs</b> with non-hepatic illness, 46 <b>dogs</b> with congenital portosystemic shunt (cPSS) and 11 <b>dogs</b> with primary hepatopathy. Haptoglobin concentrations were not significantly different between cPSS <b>dogs</b> with and without hepatic encephalopathy (HE), thus all cPSS <b>dogs</b> were considered as one group. Haptoglobin concentrations were significantly different between the remaining groups (P&# 60; 0. 0001). Hospitalised ill <b>dogs</b> had significantly higher haptoglobin concentrations than healthy <b>dogs</b> (P&# 60; 0. 001), <b>dogs</b> with cPSS (P&# 60; 0. 001) and <b>dogs</b> with primary hepatopathy (P&# 60; 0. 05). There was no significant difference between haptoglobin concentrations in healthy <b>dogs,</b> <b>dogs</b> with cPSS and <b>dogs</b> with primary hepatopathy. Haptoglobin concentrations were not significantly increased in <b>dogs</b> with liver diseases or in <b>dogs</b> with cPSS and HE. This is in contrast with the previously reported CRP results. This study demonstrates that liver function should be considered when interpreting haptoglobin concentrations in <b>dogs...</b>|$|R

5|$|Among {{the most}} popular {{activities}} for an Australian Cattle <b>Dog</b> is <b>dog</b> agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding <b>dog</b> it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately {{at a distance from}} the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle <b>Dog</b> owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.|$|E

40|$|Methods: Serum cardiac {{troponin}} I {{concentrations were}} measured in 11 healthy <b>dogs,</b> 27 <b>dogs</b> with primary haemolytic anaemia and 49 hospitalised <b>dogs</b> without primary cardiac or haematological disorders. Results: <b>Dogs</b> with primary haemolytic anaemia have higher serum concentrations of cardiac troponin I than hospitalised ill <b>dogs</b> (P < 0. 005) and healthy <b>dogs</b> (P < 0. 01). Using a cut-off {{of less than}} 0. 1 ng/mL, 20 of 27 <b>dogs</b> with primary haemolytic anaemia had increased serum cardiac troponin I concentrations, which was a significantly higher proportion compared to the hospitalised ill <b>dogs</b> (P < 0. 001, 16 out of 49 <b>dogs)</b> and healthy <b>dogs</b> (P < 0. 05, 3 out of 11 <b>dogs).</b> Clinical Significance: <b>Dogs</b> with primary haemolytic anaemia have {{a higher incidence of}} subclinical myocyte damage than healthy <b>dogs</b> or <b>dogs</b> with non-haematological or primary cardiac illnesses. The prognostic significance of increased serum cardiac troponin I concentrations in <b>dogs</b> with primary haemolytic anaemia merits further investigation...|$|R
40|$|In this study, 398 normophakic <b>dogs,</b> 85 normophakic cats, and 21 pseudophakic <b>dogs</b> were {{examined}} by retinoscopy to assess optic refraction.

With increasing age, the average refraction is shifted towards myopia (short-sightedness) which is caused by sclerotic changes of the lens nucleus.

5|$|Charles Alfred Cruft (28 June 1852 – 10 September 1938) was a British showman {{who founded}} the Crufts <b>dog</b> show. Charles first became {{involved}} with dogs {{when he began to}} work at Spratt's, a manufacturer of <b>dog</b> biscuits. He rose to the position of general manager, and whilst working for Spratt's in France he was invited to run his first <b>dog</b> show at the 1878 Exposition Universelle. After running <b>dog</b> shows in London for four years, he ran his first Cruft's <b>dog</b> show in 1891, and continued to run a further 45 shows until his death in 1938, as well as running two cat shows in 1894 and 1895. He was involved in a range of <b>dog</b> breed clubs, including that for Schipperkes, Pugs and Borzois. He and his wife upheld a story that they never owned a <b>dog,</b> and instead owned a cat, however Cruft admitted to owning at least one Saint Bernard in his memoirs, published posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{pages were}} filmed per day, {{six days a}} week, with three shows {{completed}} per week. Shooting in order was not possible. Several barn segments might be filmed {{at a particular time}} with the crew then moving on to film an equal number of kitchen scenes. The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes. Rettig was allowed to bond with the <b>dog</b> and often groomed the <b>dog</b> at the studio or spent weekends at Weatherwax's home playing with the animal. The bond translated to film, making the boy and <b>dog</b> scenes more believable, but, eventually the <b>dog</b> developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and <b>dog</b> spent together.|$|E
5|$|French Spaniels {{are also}} {{recognized}} by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, and the United Kennel Club.

5|$|In 1956, Robert Carl Suggs, {{with the}} American Museum of Natural History, led the first stratigraphical {{excavation}} {{of the islands}} and uncovered many <b>dog</b> bone fragments and one <b>dog</b> burial across a few sites {{on the island of}} Nuku Hiva. Between 1964 and 1965, American archaeologist Yosihiko H. Sinoto, with the Bishop Museum, discovered a drilled <b>dog</b> canine used as a pendant, one pre-molar and two <b>dog</b> burials in the sand dunes at Hane on the island of Ua Huka. In 1998, American archaeologist Barry Vladimir Rolett discovered <b>dog</b> bones in all levels of settlement at Hanamiai, on the island of Tahuata, indicating that the breed may have continued to exist on this island until the mid-19th century. Some of these bones had visible cut marks.

5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle <b>Dog,</b> Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of <b>dog</b> {{training}} as teaching a <b>dog</b> to sit, speak and roll over, the <b>dog</b> already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the <b>dog</b> that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the <b>dog</b> knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the <b>dog</b> can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle <b>Dog</b> is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the <b>dog.</b> Stock <b>dog</b> trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle <b>Dog</b> learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the <b>dog</b> adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle <b>Dog</b> is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
