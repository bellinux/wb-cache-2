5|$|After {{the quarry}} where Kate and Sawyer are working suffers an {{invasion}} by Alex (Tania Raymonde), who demands {{to know where}} her boyfriend Karl (Blake Bashoff) is, Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) brings Kate to talk to Jack, telling her that it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> prevent Danny Pickett (Michael Bowen) from killing Sawyer. When Jack and Kate see each other, Kate asks him to operate on Ben to prevent Sawyer from getting killed, but Jack gets angry and refuses.|$|E
5|$|Jack Bros. {{follows the}} three Jack {{brothers}} – Jack Frost, Jack Lantern and Jack Skelton – who have traveled from the fairy {{world to the}} human world through a portal that opens every year on Halloween. Losing track of time, they {{spend too much time}} in the human world, and forget about returning until there only is one hour left to the portal's closing; the fairy Pixie shows them a shortcut, which, while dangerous, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> return to the portal in time.|$|E
25|$|Message passing <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> for {{processes}} to interact.|$|R
50|$|Al-Heithami {{accepted}} that <b>the</b> Ahl al-Bayt <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> of salvation but he continues that Sunnis {{are those who}} boarded the ark.|$|R
50|$|Glacier {{is up to}} 66% {{cheaper than}} AWS S3, which in <b>the</b> past <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> of {{archiving}} on the AWS cloud.|$|R
5|$|There is no {{historical}} record {{of events in}} Iron Age Britain, so archaeological investigation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reconstruct the history of Danebury, and other such hill forts. It is impossible to state with certainty every significant event in the hill fort’s history, but where an event leaves an archaeologically identifiable trace, a general chronology can be established, although dates are much less easy to establish. The hill fort was occupied from the mid-6th centuryBC until around 100BC, and the defences were remodelled numerous times.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus, {{best known}} through L. lambei, was {{quite similar to}} Corythosaurus in {{everything}} but {{the form of the}} head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, the crest of Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were {{at the front of the}} crest and stacked vertically. It also can be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of forking nasal processes making up part of the sides of the crest, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> tell juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged.|$|E
5|$|Samar {{notices that}} Meera often prays at church. After {{a night of}} wild street dancing, they begin to fall in love. Samar helps Meera face her past, taking her to visit her estranged mother and foster reconciliation. Meera decides to confess to her father about Samar and break her engagement, but when Samar has a {{motorbike}} accident, Meera, believing she {{is the cause of}} his bad luck, prays to God to save his life, swearing never to see him again. Samar recovers and Meera reveals the vow she made. Angry, he leaves her and London altogether, challenging God to keep him alive as he risks his life every day. He believes his death <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make Meera lose her faith in God. He goes to India and enlists in the army, becoming a bomb-disposal expert.|$|E
25|$|Loading a SmartRider {{automatically}} via Autoload <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> {{users can}} achieve similar levels of fare savings {{in comparison to}} the previous Multirider system.|$|R

25|$|Owners in LLCs can {{assign a}} share of their capital {{contribution}} except where prohibited. In one-member LLCs, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> for <b>the</b> owner to withdraw capital.|$|R
5|$|To defeat more {{powerful}} monsters and gain experience points efficiently, players can join a party. A regular party {{has room for}} six members. Like in many other games, a well-balanced party will consist of several archetypes- namely a healer, a tank (the party member with high defense {{that will be the}} main target of the monster), and the damage dealer. The enmity system comes into play heavily in parties, as players try to keep the monsters attention off fragile jobs and on the tanks. A well-balanced team working together <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> defeat many of the game's enemies.|$|E
5|$|While {{the state}} parks have front country campsites {{that can be}} driven to, the federal {{sections}} of the park do not, and hiking <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reach back country campsites. These are at Mill Creek campground in Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park and Jedediah Smith campground in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, which together have 251 campsites; the Elk Prairie campground in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park which has 75; and the Gold Bluffs Beach campground which has 25 campsites. Other nearby state parks have additional front country camping.|$|E
5|$|As {{the others}} plot {{to destroy the}} {{creature}} with improvised gas bombs and flares, Corcoran flees the station and finds the creature in a nearby cave. After consuming Wyman's brain, the creature is now able {{to speak with the}} scientist's voice and has absorbed his knowledge. Corcoran asks whether Wyman's death was needed, but the creature insists it was a necessary sacrifice. The others arrive to destroy the creature, but hesitate because Corcoran will not step aside and let them throw their bombs. The creature insists it is not an evil monster, but an intelligent alien who has come to Earth to save the human race from its own self-destructive tendencies. It explains that Corcoran's body has been implanted with its embryos, which will allow the alien species to multiply and take over the human race, which the creature claims <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> truly save humanity. Upon realizing the creature is forcing the will of its species on the human race, Corcoran concludes the creature is evil after all and commits suicide so its embryos cannot come to fruition. The others then throw their explosives and kill the creature, which in its dying breaths warns that others from his species are waiting in space and will return one day to conquer humanity.|$|E
5|$|Exterminate means attacking and {{eliminating}} rival players. Since in some games all territory is eventually claimed, eliminating a rival's presence may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to achieve further expansion.|$|R
50|$|Bamboo Hill: More treacherous {{than the}} Bamboo Forest, if <b>only</b> for <b>the</b> {{increase}} in enemy forces, using <b>the</b> bamboo springs <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to progress up these rocky cliffs.|$|R
50|$|Backflow preventers are {{categorized}} {{into three}} groupings, an Assembly, a Device or a Method. With {{the exception of}} elimination, these <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ways</b> one can control backflow from taking place.|$|R
5|$|Following her {{resignation}} from Vector in {{the wake}} of her discoveries and the Gnosis Terrorism, Shion allies with underground group Scientia to investigate. Her former co-worker Allen takes her place looking after KOS-MOS. Meanwhile, Canaan, Jr., Jin, chaos, MOMO and Ziggy are investigating a landmass that originated from Lost Jerusalem. They are attacked by Margulis, then the landmass is swallowed with the Elsa in an inverted pocket of hyperspace. Shion meanwhile visits Allen, and sees the demonstration of two new weapons for fighting the Gnosis—T-elos, a battle robot meant to replace KOS-MOS; and Omega, a mech created from the Proto Omega's remains and piloted by Abel. After the test, T-elos' creator Roth Mantel informs Allen that KOS-MOS will be scrapped so development can focus on T-elos. As KOS-MOS's weaponry <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> break into the hyperspace pocket and save the Elsa, Shion leads the group into the facility and rescues KOS-MOS, guided at one point by Abel. During this time, Shion has frequent visions of the girl Nephilim, and has blackouts where she is contacted by U-DO. Events are also observed by Wilhelm, who is working with the Testaments to find both Abel and Abel's Ark.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{the player}} can find {{rustling}} patches {{of grass and}} rippling water, where they can encounter either a rare Pokémon, a Pokémon {{more common in the}} opposite game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a Pokémon whose lower forms can normally be found in the area. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> capture Pokémon such as Audino, Emolga, and Alomomola. Also, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying Pokémon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item or encounter Drilbur, Excadrill, Ducklett, or Swanna, none of which {{can be found in the}} wild otherwise. Occasionally, when throwing a Poké Ball, the capture rate is highly increased, triggered by a random event. There are also new side-games and sidequests: the player can compete in Pokémon Musicals, a side-game similar to the Pokémon Contests of previous games; the Battle Subway, similar to the Battle Towers and Battle Frontiers of previous games; and on the Royal Unova, a cruise ship that the player can ride and fight Trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items.|$|E
25|$|Realizing that {{education}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> escape poverty, Dr. Lucio C. Tan heavily invested in education. He bought the University of the East in 1990, which he considers his biggest feat in promoting {{education in the}} country.|$|E
25|$|On some islands, major rivers {{provide a}} key {{transportation}} {{link in the}} absence of good roads. On Kalimantan, longboats running on <b>the</b> rivers <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to reach many inland areas.|$|R
50|$|Facing History {{has been}} said to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> some {{students}} learn about the Holocaust in today’s society, and historian Deborah Lipstadt wrote in 1995 that this single approach is not sufficient.|$|R
50|$|However his {{conclusion}} was that annexation was overwhelmingly favoured by the leaders {{and people of}} the region, and that it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> of ending <b>the</b> devastating warfare that <b>was</b> engulfing <b>the</b> region.|$|R
25|$|A globe <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{represent}} {{the earth with}} constant scale throughout the entire map in all directions. A map cannot achieve that property for any area, no matter how small. It can, however, achieve constant scale along specific lines.|$|E
25|$|A {{blood test}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> confirm {{a case of}} Ross River Fever. Several types of blood tests {{may be used to}} examine {{antibody}} levels in the blood. Tests may either look for simply elevated antibodies (which indicate some sort of infection), or specific antibodies to the virus.|$|E
25|$|The new Anglican {{group also}} {{charged that the}} {{existing}} churches had abandoned the traditional Christian belief that Jesus Christ <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> salvation. In particular, Katharine Jefferts Schori, Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church from 2006 to 2015, was strongly criticised for her comments to that effect.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>'s</b> {{ambassador}} to <b>the</b> United Nations, Claude Heller, {{said that it}} was [...] "very clear that there was an unconstitutional coup" [...] and said that elections <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to move Madagascar forward.|$|R
50|$|At {{one time}} a royal charter <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> {{in which an}} {{incorporated}} body could be formed, but other means (such as the registration process for limited companies) are generally now used instead.|$|R
50|$|Alternate titles {{considered}} <b>were</b> <b>The</b> <b>Only</b> <b>Way</b> to Love and Girl Crazy. Joe Pasternak {{had produced}} the similar spring break movie Where the Boys Are, {{which was also}} set in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1960.|$|R
25|$|Free Grace Theology is {{distinguished}} by its soteriology or doctrine of salvation. Its advocates believe that God justifies the sinner on the sole condition {{of faith in}} Christ, not righteous living. Their definition of faith involves belief, trust, and conviction that Jesus <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> salvation.|$|E
25|$|Swami Vivekananda {{suggested}} {{to try to}} give up jealousy and conceit and learn to work unitedly for others. He told that purity, patience and perseverance overcome all obstacles. He {{suggested to}} take courage and work on. Patience and steady work, according to Swami Vivekananda, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get success.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{theological}} epistemology of the tradition, scriptural or Vedic knowledge <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> achieve {{the knowledge of}} the out-worldly or transcendental realm. However the notable exception to this rule is what is called vaidushya-pratyaksa, or the faultless and pure perception of a pure realised soul, which forms the foundation of scripture itself.|$|E
5|$|Civil {{divorce is}} not a divorce {{according}} to the Church. If it is deemed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> of ensuring legal rights, care of children, or protection of inheritance, the Church considers it morally acceptable.|$|R
25|$|In {{single-celled}} algae, chloroplast division <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> new chloroplasts <b>are</b> formed. There is no proplastid differentiation—when an algal cell divides, its chloroplast divides {{along with}} it, and each daughter cell receives a mature chloroplast.|$|R
30|$|At this time, {{rationing}} {{seems to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> of managing water shortage in Tlemcen. The rationed households {{seem to have}} adapted and developed strategies of storage, which depend on the frequency of water supply.|$|R
