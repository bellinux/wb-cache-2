25|$|Ed Harris did not {{actually}} breathe the fluid. He <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> inside a helmet full of liquid while being towed 30 feet (10 m) {{below the surface of}} the large tank. He recalled that the worst moments were being towed with fluid rushing up his nose and his eyes swelling up. Actors played their scenes at 33 feet (11 m), too shallow a depth for them to need decompression, and rarely stayed down for more than an hour at a time. Cameron and the 26-person underwater diving crew sank to 50 feet (17 m) and stayed down for five hours at a time. To avoid decompression sickness, they would have to hang from hoses halfway up the tank for as long as two hours, breathing pure oxygen.|$|E
500|$|Voice coach John Quinlan was {{impressed}} by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, [...] "He has far more voice than people think he has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mic either". [...] As a singer, early on he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby, but later believed that Tony Bennett was [...] "the best singer in the business". [...] Bennett also praised Sinatra himself, claiming that as a performer, he had [...] "perfected the art of intimacy." [...] According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a [...] "fairly rangy voice", [...] remarking that [...] "His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint". Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was [...] "virtually undetectable", with his diction becoming [...] "precise" [...] and articulation [...] "meticulous". His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to [...] "toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric". [...] Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would [...] "take a musical phrase and play {{it all the way}} through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars." [...] Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone, and Sinatra regularly swam and <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.|$|E
60|$|Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, {{looking down}} from the top of a tall tree, held their breath. Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel and his cousin, Chatterer the Red Squirrel, looking down from another tree, held their breath. Unc' Billy Possum, {{sticking}} his head out from a hollow tree, <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Bobby Coon, looking through a hole in a hollow stump in which he was hiding, <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Reddy Fox, lying flat down behind a heap of brush, <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Peter Rabbit, sitting bolt upright under a thick hemlock branch, with eyes and ears wide open, <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> And all the other little people who happened to be where they could see did the same thing.|$|E
6000|$|The doctor {{looked at}} Sam agin, and Sam <b>held</b> <b>'is</b> <b>breath</b> while 'e {{waited for him}} to answer. [...] "Yes," [...] ses the doctor at last, [...] "if he does just wot I tell him and takes the {{medicine}} I send 'im." ...|$|R
60|$|Sometimes Mr. Cutts {{watched in}} the plantations, and {{sometimes}} 'e hid 'imself near Bob's house, {{and at last}} one night, when 'e was crouching behind the fence of Frederick Scott's front garden, 'e saw Bob Pretty come out of 'is house and, arter a careful look round, walk up the road. He <b>held</b> <b>'is</b> <b>breath</b> as Bob passed 'im, and was just getting up to foller 'im when Bob stopped and walked slowly back agin, sniffing.|$|R
60|$|In a poor, mean room; {{working at}} {{the same kind of}} {{embroidery}} which he had often, often seen before her; Meg, his own dear daughter, was presented to his view. He made no effort to imprint his kisses on her face; he did not strive to clasp her to his loving heart; he knew that such endearments were, for him, no more. But, he <b>held</b> <b>his</b> trembling <b>breath,</b> and brushed away the blinding tears, that he might look upon her; that he might only see her.|$|R
60|$|Agravaine <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> But all was well. The damsel bowed.|$|E
60|$|The Frolic was {{abreast of}} them, and he <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> with suspense.|$|E
60|$|And all {{the time}} Unc' Billy Possum <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> and lay low.|$|E
60|$|Then honesty {{demanded that}} he probe his own feelings. Sternly, as if judging a renegade, he searched {{out in his}} simple way the truth. This big-eyed lass with her nameless charm would bewitch even a borderman, unless he avoided her. So much he had not {{admitted}} until now. Love he had never believed could be possible for him. When she fell asleep her hand had slipped from his arm to his fingers, and now rested there lightly as a leaf. The contact was delight. The gentle night breeze blew a tress of hair across his lips. He trembled. Her rounded shoulder pressed against him until {{he could feel her}} slow, deep breathing. He almost <b>held</b> <b>his</b> own <b>breath</b> lest he disturb her rest.|$|R
50|$|As Valerie <b>held</b> <b>his</b> {{hands for}} the last time, with <b>his</b> dying <b>breath</b> Bart Allen finally professed his undying love for her.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy's {{skin was}} brown, {{his mouth was}} firm, and his look alert. His hands were {{blistered}} and his back was sore, {{but this was not}} important. He could now pull a big saw through gummy logs and, as a rule, drive the shining ax-head where he wanted it to go. A belt <b>held</b> <b>his</b> overalls tight at his waist; when he tilted back his head to get <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> <b>his</b> balance and pose were good.|$|R
60|$|Louis <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and stood}} rigid at the meaning her words conveyed.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Groombride <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{and turned}} purple. Then he stamped his foot.|$|E
60|$|March felt reassured; nevertheless, he {{shut his}} eyes very tight and <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
60|$|She linked {{her arms}} around his neck; her cheek touched his for a moment, and he was {{surprised}} to find it as hot as fire. He stepped out bravely enough, but with every step {{it seemed to him that}} she was growing heavier. Her hands were still tightly linked around his neck, but her limbs were inert. She seemed to be falling away. He <b>held</b> her tighter, <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> began to grow shorter. The perfume of the clover, fragrant and delicate, grew stronger with every step they took. Somehow he felt that that walk along the narrow path was carving its way into his life. The fingers at the back of his neck were cold, yet she, too, was breathing as though she had been running. Her eyes were half closed. He looked once into her face, bent over her until his lips nearly touched hers. He set his teeth hard. Some instinct warned him of the dangers of the moment. Her stick slipped and a lump arose in his throat. The moment had passed. He kissed her softly upon the forehead.|$|R
60|$|Deringham, however, showed {{but little}} {{evidence}} of dismay or astonishment. Had he been liable to do so, {{he would not have}} <b>held</b> <b>his</b> own so long in the occupation he followed. <b>His</b> <b>breath</b> came a trifle more quickly, and his hand trembled a little, but he rested it upon the table, and all that Alton noticed was a curious little movement about the corner of his eyes. The rancher, however, remembered it.|$|R
60|$|While {{waiting for}} the water to boil, he <b>held</b> <b>his</b> face over the stove. The {{moisture}} from <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> had collected on his beard and frozen into a great mass of ice, and this he proceeded to thaw out. As it melted and dropped upon the stove it sizzled and rose about him in steam. He helped the process with his fingers, working loose small ice-chunks that fell rattling to the floor.|$|R
60|$|And then, {{looking toward}} the bed, he saw that dirty lady, and <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> with astonishment.|$|E
60|$|And as Petru {{looked at}} her the magic flute dropped by his side, and he <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
60|$|Jimmy, {{knowing what}} the hazard was, pressed his telegraph, and <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> until a harsh voice rose again.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was a}} {{long time}} before he again {{mastered}} himself; then he went to the scullery and <b>held</b> <b>his</b> head under the tap till the water took away <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> then polished <b>his</b> face till it shone, and then went and sat quietly down till Mrs. Andrews came in and told him that he could go upstairs to George. He went up to the bedside and took George's hand, but he could not trust himself to speak.|$|R
6000|$|He {{had begun}} to seek for <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> with deep sighs. [...] "The blue phial," [...] said he--"in the aumry--the blue phial." [...] <b>His</b> <b>breath</b> came slower still.|$|R
60|$|Starling, {{if indeed}} he were there, seemed {{now to be}} even holding <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Arnold took one step back and charged the door. It went {{crashing}} in, and almost at {{once there was a}} loud report. The closet--it was little more--was filled with smoke, and Arnold heard distinctly the hiss of a bullet buried in the woodwork over his shoulder. He caught the revolver from the shaking fingers of the man who was crouching upon the ground, and slipped it into his pocket. With his other hand, he <b>held</b> <b>his</b> prisoner powerless.|$|R
60|$|Several {{times they}} {{came close to}} where Leo was lying, and he fairly <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> until they passed on.|$|E
60|$|The ship leaped. Kramer {{closed his}} eyes and <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> They were moving out into space, gaining speed each moment.|$|E

60|$|Now, Mr. Cymon Tuggs {{never could}} smoke without feeling it indispensably {{necessary}} to retire, immediately, and never could smell smoke without a strong disposition to cough. The cigars were introduced; {{the captain was}} a professed smoker; so was the lieutenant; so was Joseph Tuggs. The apartment was small, the door was closed, the smoke powerful: it hung in heavy wreaths over the room, and at length found its way behind the curtain. Cymon Tuggs <b>held</b> <b>his</b> nose, <b>his</b> mouth, <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> It was all of no use—out came the cough.|$|R
6000|$|When Ellen came in, {{and after}} a short {{greeting}} to Betsey Hardman, went up- stairs, she found Alfred lying back on his pillow, deadly white, the beads of dew standing on his brow, and <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> in gasps. She would have shrieked for her mother, but he <b>held</b> out <b>his</b> hand, and said, in a low hoarse whisper, 'Ellen, is it true?' ...|$|R
2500|$|.....while talking or even musing {{as he sat}} in his chair, he {{commonly}} <b>held</b> <b>his</b> head to {{one side}} towards his right shoulder, and shook it in a tremulous manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his mouth; sometimes giving a half whistle, sometimes making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking like a hen, and sometimes protruding it against his upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly under <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> 'Too, too, too.' All this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, {{in the course of a}} dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> like a Whale.|$|R
6000|$|The father <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> What {{on earth}} could this mean? [...] "And {{who is the}} girl, Granville?" [...] he asked, with unconcealed interest.|$|E
6000|$|Razumov <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{before the}} bronze as if expecting a crash. Behind his back a voice {{he had never}} heard before insisted politely-- ...|$|E
60|$|Wetherell <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> For {{a moment}} Mr. Worthington sat very still, his face drawn, {{and then he}} wet his lips and rose slowly.|$|E
60|$|On {{this day}} {{it had become}} evident to Pearson, to his aged guest, and to Dorothy, that Ilbrahim's brief and troubled pilgrimage drew near its close. The two former would willingly have {{remained}} by him, {{to make use of}} the prayers and pious discourses which they deemed appropriate to the time, and which, if they be impotent as to the departing traveller's reception in the world whither he goes, may at least sustain him in bidding adieu to earth. But though Ilbrahim uttered no complaint, he was disturbed by the faces that looked upon him; so that Dorothy's entreaties, and their own conviction that the child's feet might tread heaven's pavement and not soil it, had induced the two Quakers to remove. Ilbrahim then closed his eyes and grew calm, and, except for now and then a kind and low word to his nurse, might have been thought to slumber. As nightfall came on, however, and the storm began to rise, something seemed to trouble the repose of the boy's mind, and to render his sense of hearing active and acute. If a passing wind lingered to shake the casement, he strove to turn his head towards it; if the door jarred to and fro upon its hinges, he looked long and anxiously thitherward; if the heavy voice of the old man, as he read the Scriptures, rose but a little higher, the child almost <b>held</b> <b>his</b> dying <b>breath</b> to listen; if a snow-drift swept by the cottage, with a sound like the trailing of a garment, Ilbrahim seemed to watch that some visitant should enter.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bultiwell groaned under <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> <b>His</b> {{eyes met}} {{the eyes of}} his old employé.|$|R
6000|$|He but {{requested}} to be bled to death: [...] The surgeon had his instruments, and bled [...] Pedrillo, and so gently ebb'd <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> [...] You hardly could perceive {{when he was}} dead. [...] He died as born, a Catholic in faith, [...] Like most in the belief in which they 're bred, [...] And first a little crucifix he kiss'd, [...] And then <b>held</b> out <b>his</b> jugular and wrist.|$|R
