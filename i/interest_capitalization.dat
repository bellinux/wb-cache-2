40|$|In {{this paper}} we shall {{prove that the}} plane of {{financial}} events, introduced and applied to financial problems by the author himself (see [2], [3] and [4]) {{can be considered as}} a fiber bundle in two different ways. The first one, the natural one, reveals itself to be isomorphic to the tangent bundle of the real line, when the last one is considered as a differentiable manifold in the natural way; the second one is a fibration induced by the status of compound <b>interest</b> <b>capitalization</b> at a given rate i in the interval] − 1, → [. Moreover, in the paper we define on the first vector bundle an affine connection, also in this case induced by the compound <b>interest</b> <b>capitalization</b> at a given rate i. The final goal of this paper is the awareness that all the effects determined by compound <b>interest</b> <b>capitalization</b> are nothing but the consequences {{of the fact that the}} space of financial events is a fibration endowed with a particular affine connection, so they are consequences of purely geometric properties, at last, depending upon the curvature determined by the connection upon the fibration. A natural preorder upon the set of fibers of the second fibration is considered. Some remarks about the applicability to economics and finance of the theories presented in the paper and about the possible developments are given in the directions followed in papers [1], [5], [6], [7], [8] of the author himself. ...|$|E
40|$|The author's {{dynamic model}} of {{international}} borrowing subject to credit constraint {{was developed for}} an economy with increasing returns to physical capital. Increases in the capital stock within the nonconvex range increase debtor borrowing opportunities. Conversely, a temporary liquidity shock may permanently lower the economy's growth path. Introducing aggregate nonconvexities also has different implications for policy on debt overhangs. In particular, the model allows for rational relending by creditors. It also predicts that new money (or <b>interest</b> <b>capitalization)</b> {{is in the interest}} of creditors and will be part of a debt restructuring strategy - as it was recently for Mexico and the Philippines.

40|$|Implementation of {{capitalization}} {{treatment of}} borrowing costs is often questioned {{related to the}} effective of accounting information presentation. So far, PSAK Indonesia had already adapted these issues taken from SFAS. About two half years later, PSAK No. 26 had been revised at mid term of January 1997, by adding some important stressing about qualifying assets. One thing {{to be considered in}} accounting treatment implementation is the false impact in the process of decision making, e. g. in [1] investment decision and [2] bias effect related to the qualitative characteristics elements like relevance and reliability. Also, capitalization tends to leave conservatism principle behind. Related to the evaluation of interest cost capitalization effect that is implemented in property sector, PSAK No. 26 do not rule strictly about which procedures to be taken. So that, every company is free to [1] use capitalized interest cost valuation calculation method needed, [2] determine the period of interest cost capitalization, [3] record <b>interest</b> <b>capitalization</b> in certain asset account, and [4] not disclose transparently, mainly requirements beyond regulations. All that things can cause presented financial report containing not only bias, but also mark-up practice in assets value, earnings management, and presentation other numbers, which tend to be over-optimistic behavior. The less strict and fair regulations also bring lending institutions in dilemma situation, because companies often hide behind the chink of such regulations. PSAK No. 26 do not support users of financial report to more understand about core business of company (especially in property sector), on the other hand it gives many chances for companies to do many malpractices...|$|E

40|$|Since August 1982 the {{international}} debt crisis has dominated economic policymaking {{in the developing}} countries, economic relations between the debtor and creditor countries, {{the attention of the}} multilateral institutions in their dealings with the debtor nations, and private sector decisions on lending to the developing countries. The period since 1982 has seen some progress. Neither the commercial nor central banks have had to deal with formal large-scale debt defaults. Balance sheets of creditor banks have been strengthened. There is an active secondary market in developing country debt, and debt to equity swaps are a reality. For the debtors, real interest rates have fallen between 1982 and 1987. Net exports showed extraordinary growth. Budget deficits have been reduced despite falling incomes. In 1987 commodity prices have begun to recover. The period has seen a shift toward rather than away from democracy. But five years after it began, the debt crisis is very much alive. None of the major Latin American countries has restored normal access to {{the international}} capital markets. At least one major debtor has been in trouble each year. Three classes of solutions are described and evaluated. Least radical are proposals for procedural reform and changes {{in the nature of the}} claims on the existing debt. Some procedural reforms such as multiyear reschedulings and exit vehicles for smaller banks have already begun to be instituted. Others include changes in accounting rules, and U. S. information provision on foreign accounts held in the U. S. Changes in the nature of claims include debt-equity swaps, country funds, <b>interest</b> <b>capitalization,</b> and payment by the debtors in their own currency. The second type of solution is the creation of a facility, or new institution to deal with the overhang of existing debt. The institution would buy the debt from the banks in exchange for claims on the institution, and in turn collect from the debtor countries. The prices at which debt is purchased, and the amounts to be collected from the debtors are the crucial issues. Finally, there are proposals for debt relief, either in direct negotiation between creditors and debtors and/or in conjunction with the creation of a facility. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} ex post {{returns to}} emerging market debt by combining secondary-market prices with observed flows based on World Bank data. From 1970 - 2000, returns averaged 9 percent per annum, {{about the same}} as returns on a ten-year U. S. treasury bond. This reflects the combined effect of the 1980 s debt crisis and much higher returns during 1989 - 2000. Annual returns since 1986 have been less volatile than emerging market equity returns but more volatile than returns on U. S. corporate or high-yield bonds. However, unlike returns on these bonds, emerging market debt returns do not seem significantly correlated with U. S. or world stock markets.

40|$|The Talmud’s {{analysis}} of asset valuation comprises deep insights often mixed with abstruse logic. This amalgam is {{likely due to}} religious stric-tures. Consider the issues of <b>interest</b> and <b>capitalization.</b> Biblical law pro-hibits the payment of interest on loans. According to the Talmud, even nominal interest rates are usurious and strictly forbidden by religious sanction. 1 It is hardly surprising, therefore, that Talmudic scholars do not always value assets from a purely economic perspective. This is not because the Talmud does not understand interest. On the contrary, “interest is the time value of money, ” declares Rabbi Nachman. 2 Nor {{is the concept of}} capitalization a problem. Indeed, when valuation involves human capital, the Talmud correctly values these assets by reference to slave markets (see Kleiman 1987).

Although balance-sheet measures of leverage are available, {{it is useful}} to construct a measure of leverage that incorporates both on- and off-balance-sheet activities. This paper provides measures of leverage implicit in derivative contracts by decomposing the contracts into cash market equivalent components. A leverage ratio can then be calculated for this replicating portfolio, which consists of own funds (equity) and borrowed funds equivalents (debt). Methods for aggregating leverage by institution and by markets are presented. The interaction between leverage and risk is discussed, and a modified capital adequacy ratio is calculated, which captures off-balance-sheet exposure.

40|$|Capitalization {{rates for}} all {{commercial}} real estate are affected by changes in the general level of <b>interest</b> rates. Hotel <b>capitalization</b> rates should respond more quickly to interest rate changes than those of other property types because hotels do not experience the “lease friction” found in other commercial properties, with their lengthy leases. This analysis estimates the statistical connection between interest rate changes and cap rates. Holding other important factors constant, the model estimates that at current levels a 100 -basis-point increase in the 10 -year U. S. Treasury rate will produce a 28 -basis-point uptick in hotel capitalization rates. Continuing improvement in the U. S. economy should eventually result in higher interest rates, but any improvement should also bring both compression of the hotel risk premium and stronger NOI growth, each of which place downward pressure on capitalization rates. With hotel capitalization rates currently {{in a range of}} 7. 0 to 8. 5 percent and an expected slow pace of interest-rate changes, the modelled outcome suggests that hotel property values will remain stable for the foreseeable future. Hotel investors should therefore have ample time to ponder disposition decisions without fear of losing gains while new investors will need to rely on the strong dividend flows currently being produced by hotels for a greater shares of total returns...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} the trends and pattern of institutional credit supply to agriculture during pre- and post-financial reforms {{along with their}} determinants. It then compared the effects of reform policies on access to institutional credits in Nigerian agricultural sector {{before and after the}} reforms (1978 - 1985; and 1986 - 2009). Relying mainly on time series data from CBN and NBS, it used ordinary least squares method (linear, semi-log and double log) to model the determinants of banking sector lending to the agricultural sector during the review period. The models were subjected to several econometric tests before accepting one. Chow test was used to verify the presence of structural change in the selected equation before and after the reforms. Results indicated an exponentially increasing trend of agricultural credit supply in the economy after the reform began. Econometric analysis shows that stock market <b>capitalization,</b> <b>interest</b> rate and immediate past volume of credit guaranteed by ACGSF significantly influenced the quantity of institutional credit supplied to the agricultural sector over the period in review.

ABSTRACT: Lending {{represents one of the}} core functions of commercial banking system. The essential role of banks in the economy has been to intermediate funds between surplus and deficit economic units. In the process of carrying out this primary task, banks have found themselves performing a number of functions which include: the mobilization of savings, stimulation of investment and economic growth, assistance in resources allocation, boosting of international trade and promotion of the payment system. The few studies which have been conducted on bank lending in Nigeria focused on the pre-consolidation banking era. This study examines the effect of deposit volume on bank lending behaviour in the Nigerian post-consolidation banking period. The population of the study comprises the 22 deposit money banks operating in Nigeria as at December, 2012. Data were obtained from the audited annual reports of the 22 banks for the post-consolidation period of 2006 - 2012. The analysis was conducted using regression analysis with the aid of SPSS package. The results revealed a positive and significant relationship between deposit volume and loan and advances in the selected banks. The study recommends that future researchers should investigate other factors which may exert some influence on the lending behaviour deposit money banks in Nigeria beside deposit volume. Specifically, factors such as <b>capitalization,</b> <b>interest</b> rates, gross domestic product, and liquidity ratio were mentioned...|$|R
