5|$|Augustus' public revenue reforms <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{impact on}} the {{subsequent}} success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus' predecessors had done. This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.|$|E

In two successive English seasons, he completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in first-class games.|$|E
5|$|Except for the Munich area, {{the unit}} {{was unable to}} {{maintain}} any momentum. The membership of the SS declined from 1000 to 280 as the SS continued to struggle under the SA. As Heiden attempted to keep the small group from dissolving, Heinrich Himmler became his deputy in September 1927. Himmler <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> enthusiasm and vision for the SS and displayed good organisational abilities which Heiden used. Himmler became the driving force within the SS and in time eclipsed Heiden.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS has <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{impact on}} society, {{both as an}} illness and {{as a source of}} discrimination. The disease also has large {{economic}} impacts.

The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion including the Catholic Church's position not to support condom use as prevention. It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.|$|E
