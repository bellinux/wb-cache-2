50|$|The outlet {{pressure}} and the inlet pressure hold the diaphragm/poppet assembly in the closed position against {{the force of the}} large spring. If the supply pressure falls, {{it is as if the}} large spring compression is increased allowing more gas and higher pressure to build in the outlet chamber until an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>pressure</b> is reached. Thus, if the supply pressure falls, the {{outlet pressure}} will increase, provided the outlet pressure remains below the falling supply pressure. This is the cause of end-of-tank dump where the supply is provided by a pressurized gas tank. With a single stage regulator, when the supply tank gets low, the lower inlet pressure causes the outlet pressure to climb. If the spring compression is not adjusted to compensate, the poppet can remain open and allow the tank to rapidly dump its remaining contents. In other words, the lower the supply pressure, the lower the pressure differential the regulator can achieve for a given spring setting.|$|E
