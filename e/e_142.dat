40|$|Abstract Background The {{majority}} of experimentally determined crystal structures of Type II restriction endonucleases (REases) exhibit a common PD-(D/E) XK fold. Crystal structures have been also determined for single representatives {{of two other}} folds: PLD (R. BfiI) and half-pipe (R. PabI), and bioinformatics analyses supported by mutagenesis suggested that some REases belong to the HNH fold. Our previous bioinformatic analysis suggested that REase R. Eco 29 kI shares sequence similarities with one more unrelated nuclease superfamily, GIY-YIG, however so far no experimental data were available to support this prediction. The determination of a crystal structure of the GIY-YIG domain of homing endonuclease I-TevI provided a template for modeling of R. Eco 29 kI and prompted us to validate the model experimentally. Results Using protein fold-recognition methods we generated a new alignment between R. Eco 29 kI and I-TevI, which suggested a reassignment {{of one of the}} putative catalytic residues. A theoretical model of R. Eco 29 kI was constructed to illustrate its predicted three-dimensional fold and organization of the active site, comprising amino acid residues Y 49, Y 76, R 104, H 108, <b>E</b> <b>142,</b> and N 154. A series of mutants was constructed to generate amino acid substitutions of selected residues (Y 49 A, R 104 A, H 108 F, <b>E</b> <b>142</b> A and N 154 L) and the mutant proteins were examined for their ability to bind the DNA containing the Eco 29 kI site 5 '-CCGCGG- 3 ' and to catalyze the cleavage reaction. Experimental data reveal that residues Y 49, R 104, <b>E</b> <b>142,</b> H 108, and N 154 are important for the nuclease activity of R. Eco 29 kI, while H 108 and N 154 are also important for specific DNA binding by this enzyme. Conclusion Substitutions of residues Y 49, R 104, H 108, <b>E</b> <b>142</b> and N 154 predicted by the model {{to be a part of}} the active site lead to mutant proteins with strong defects in the REase activity. These results are in very good agreement with the structural model presented in this work and with our prediction that R. Eco 29 kI belongs to the GIY-YIG superfamily of nucleases. Our study provides the first experimental evidence for a Type IIP REase that does not belong to the PD-(D/E) XK or HNH superfamilies of nucleases, and is instead a member of the unrelated GIY-YIG superfamily. </p...|$|E
40|$|All known nitrilase {{superfamily}} amidase and carbamoylase structures have {{an additional}} glutamate that is hydrogen bonded to the catalytic lysine {{in addition to}} the Glu, Lys, Cys “catalytic triad. ” In the amidase from Geobacillus pallidus, mutating this glutamate (Glu- 142) to a leucine or aspartate renders the enzyme inactive.

40|$|AbstractMolecular {{surveillance}} {{provides a}} powerful approach to monitoring the resistance status of parasite {{populations in the}} field and for understanding resistance evolution. Oxamniquine was used to treat Brazilian schistosomiasis patients (mid- 1970 s to mid- 2000 s) and several cases of parasite infections resistant to treatment were recorded. The gene underlying resistance (SmSULT-OR) encodes a sulfotransferase required for intracellular drug activation. Resistance has a recessive basis and occurs when both SmSULT-OR alleles encode for defective proteins. Here we examine SmSULT-OR sequence variation in a natural schistosome population in Brazil ∼ 40 years after the first use of this drug. We sequenced SmSULT-OR from 189 individual miracidia (1 – 11 per patient) recovered from 49 patients, and tested proteins expressed from putative resistance alleles for their ability to activate oxamniquine. We found nine mutations (four non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, three non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms and two indels). Both mutations (p. <b>E</b> <b>142</b> del and p.

We also found two additional mutations (a splice site variant and 1 bp coding insertion) predicted to encode non-functional truncated proteins. Two additional substitutions (p. G 206 V, p.

Three results are of particular interest: (i) we recovered the p. <b>E</b> <b>142</b> del mutation from the field: this same deletion is responsible for resistance in an oxamniquine selected laboratory parasite population; (ii) frequencies of resistance alleles are extremely low (0. 27 – 0. 8 %), perhaps due to fitness costs associated with carriage of these alleles; (iii) that four independent resistant alleles were found is consistent with the idea that multiple mutations can generate loss-of-function alleles...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The greater {{reactivity}} of esters relative to amides has typically been {{reflected in their}} faster rates of both solvolysis and enzymatic hydrolysis. In contrast to this general principle, the serine hydrolytic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) was found to degrade amides and esters with equivalent catalytic efficiencies. Mutation of a single lysine residue (K 142) to alanine (K 142 A) abolished this property, generating a catalytically compromised enzyme that hydrolyzed esters more than 500 -fold faster than amides. Conversion of this same lysine residue to glutamic acid (K <b>142</b> <b>E)</b> produced an enzyme that also displayed severely diminished catalytic activity, but one that now maintained FAAH’s ability to react with amides and esters at competitive rates. The significant catalytic defects exhibited by both the K 142 A and K <b>142</b> <b>E</b> mutants, in conjunction with their altered pH-rate profiles, support a role for lysine 142 as a general base involved in the activation of FAAH’s serine nucleophile. Moreover, the dramatically different amide versus ester selectivities observed for the K 142 A and K <b>142</b> <b>E</b> mutants reveal that FAAH’s catalytic efficiency and catalytic selectivity depend on distinguishable properties of the same residue, with the former relying on a strong catalytic base and the latter requiring coupled general acid-base catalysis. We hypothesize that FAAH’s unusual catalytic properties may empower the enzyme to function effectively as both an amidase and esterase in vivo...|$|R

The polarized gluon distribution occuring in the gluon anomaly {{does not have to}} be large in order to be consistent with either set of experimental data. However, it appears that the discrepancies in the implications of these data cannot be resolved with any simple theoretical arguments. We conclude that more experiments must be performed in order to adequately determine the fraction of spin carried by each of the nucleon constituents. Comment: 23 page...|$|E
40|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} is {{the most}} frequent cause of adrenal insufficiency and ambiguous genitalia in newborn children. In contrast to congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21 -hydroxylase and 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiencies, which impair steroid formation in the adrenal cortex, exclusively, classical 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) deficiency affects steroid biosynthesis in the gonads {{as well as in}} the adrenals. The structures of the highly homologous type I and II 3 beta-HSD genes have been analyzed in three male pseudohermaphrodite 3 beta-HSD deficient patients from unrelated families in order to elucidate the molecular basis of classical 3 beta-HSD deficiency from patients exhibiting various degrees of severity of salt losing. The nucleotide sequence of DNA fragments generated by selective polymerase chain reaction amplification that span the four exons, the exon-intron boundaries, as well as the 52 ̆ 7 -flanking region of each of the two 3 beta-HSD genes have been determined in the three male patients. The five point mutations characterized were all detected in the type II 3 beta-HSD gene, which is the gene predominantly expressed in the adrenals and gonads, while no mutation was detected in the type I 3 beta-HSD gene, predominantly expressed in the placenta and peripheral tissues. The two male patients suffering from severe salt-losing 3 beta-HSD deficiency are compound heterozygotes, one bearing the frame-shift mutation 186 /insC/ 187 and the missense mutation Y 253 N, while the other bears the nonsense mutation W 171 X and the missense mutation <b>E</b> <b>142</b> K. The influence of the detected missense mutations on enzymatic activity was assessed by in vitro expression analysis of mutant recombinant enzymes generated by site-directed mutagenesis in heterologous mammalian cells. Recombinant mutant type II 3 beta-HSD enzymes carrying Y 253 N or <b>E</b> <b>142</b> K substitutions exhibit no detectable activity. On the other hand, the nonsalt-losing patient is homozygous for the missense mutation A 245 P. This mutation decreases 3 beta-HSD activity by approximately 90...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{optimize}} the formulation of lipid nanoparticles (NPs), intended for brain targeting, with the aid of a computer generated experimental design. The high pressure homogenization technique, selected for this purpose, was suitable to formulate the 3 investigated lipids (i. <b>e.,</b> Softisan(®) <b>142,</b> SOFT; Compritol(®) 888 ATO, COMP; cetyl palmitate, CP) into nanometre-length particles, while the computer generated experimental design helped to individuate the best preparation conditions with a small number of experimental assay. Even though all the 3 optimized formulations were suitable for intravenous infusion, CP NPs showed the smallest particle size and the appropriate thermal behaviour to be used as carriers in brain targeting applications...|$|R

Methods: A total of <b>142</b> <b>E.</b> coli isolates were isolated from diarrheic samples. The isolates were examined for detection of virulence determinants and their phylogenetic background by PCR technique. Results: The E. coli isolates fall into four phylogenetic groups: A (40. 14...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{indicate}} that the carboxyl terminal of connexin 43 (Cx 43 CT) is involved in fast transjunctional voltage gating. Separate studies support {{the notion of an}} intramolecular association between Cx 43 CT and a region of the cytoplasmic loop (amino acids 119 – 144; referred to as “L 2 ”). Structural analysis of L 2 shows two α-helical domains, each with a histidine residue in its sequence (H 126 and H 142). Here, we determined the effect of H 142 replacement by lysine, alanine, and glutamate on the voltage gating of Cx 43 channels. Mutation H <b>142</b> <b>E</b> led to a significant reduction in the frequency of occurrence of the residual state and a prolongation of dwell open time. Macroscopically, there was a large reduction in the fast component of voltage gating. These results resembled those observed for a mutant lacking the carboxyl terminal (CT) domain. NMR experiments showed that mutation H <b>142</b> <b>E</b> significantly decreased the Cx 43 CT-L 2 interaction and disrupted the secondary structure of L 2. Overall, our data support the hypothesis that fast voltage gating involves an intramolecular particle-receptor interaction between CT and L 2. Some of the structural constrains of fast voltage gating may be shared with those involved in the chemical gating of Cx 43...|$|R
