5|$|China's {{economic}} policies laid {{the basis of}} the <b>industrialization</b> drive in export-oriented development, and its reliance on low-wage manufacturing to produce consumer goods for the world market. Young migrant women left their homes in rural settings to work in urban industrial areas. Work included export-oriented <b>industrialization,</b> manufacturing in electronics and toy assembly, sewing in garment production, and mixed assembly and sewing in the footwear industry. Hong Kong and Shenzhen were cities established as centers of export-oriented <b>industrialization,</b> and migrant women workers have made up 70% of Shenzhen's three million people.|$|E

5|$|The Givors canal {{played an}} {{important}} role in the early <b>industrialization</b> of Givors and the Gier valley, and became highly profitable.|$|E
5|$|A {{social control}} program was {{implemented}} whereby local unions took on responsibility for ensuring that this quota was not exceeded; in doing so, {{they hoped to}} remove the need for military and police intervention, and thus stem the violence of previous decades. Measures were implemented to ensure the <b>industrialization</b> of coca production, with Morales inaugurating the first coca <b>industrialization</b> plant in Chulumani, which produced and packaged coca and trimate tea; the project was primarily funded through a $125,000 donation from Venezuela under the PTA scheme.|$|E
5|$|Although the two poems seem separated, {{they both}} endorse an {{evolutionary}} {{view of the}} world. Darwin did not see a distinction between nature and culture; <b>industrialization</b> and technological progress {{were part of a}} single evolutionary process.|$|E
5|$|Villermé’s Tableau {{discussed}} {{the role of}} <b>industrialization</b> on the general health {{and quality of life}} for the laboring class. His perspective in this work is unique in that he maintained that the process of <b>industrialization</b> is not completely to blame. He even suggested the industrial movement to be beneficial for the future of society, calling on examples of <b>industrialization</b> in the United States. He also {{discussed the}} role of children working in the textile industry. The point is made that, in some cases, {{at least half of the}} workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen. Villermé contrasted the quality of life of workers who maintained family life with those taken over completely by their labor. He blamed both the working conditions associated with <b>industrialization</b> as well as the workers themselves to an extent. This work served not only as valuable information to medical institutions and boards, but also as a social statement, widely accepted by the public. It is from this work that Villermé received his reputation as a moral economist.|$|E
5|$|An {{enduring}} theme {{during and}} after the oil boom has been a reluctance among Texans to relinquish their identity and a stubbornness in maintaining their cultural heritage in the face of drastic changes to the state brought by the sudden wealth. Despite its growth and <b>industrialization,</b> Texas culture in the mid-20th century remained distinct from the other industrial centers of the nation.|$|E
5|$|Delesio Antonio Berni (Rosario, 14 May 1905 - Buenos Aires, 13 October 1981) was an Argentine figurative artist. He is {{associated}} with the movement known as Nuevo Realismo ("New Realism"), a Latin American extension of social realism. His work, including a series of Juanito Laguna collages depicting poverty and the effects of <b>industrialization</b> in Buenos Aires, has been exhibited around the world.|$|E
5|$|Finnish {{society had}} {{experienced}} rapid population growth, <b>industrialization,</b> pre-urbanization {{and the rise}} of a comprehensive labor movement. The country's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of democratization and modernization, while the people's socioeconomic condition and national-cultural status gradually improved. World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire and a power struggle, militarization and escalating crisis between the left-leaning Finnish labor movement and the Finnish conservatives.|$|E
5|$|In the North, {{urbanization}} and {{an unprecedented}} influx {{of immigrants from}} Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's <b>industrialization</b> and transformed its culture. National infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement {{and development of the}} American Old West. The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.|$|E
5|$|More {{fish have}} been {{discovered}} in the newly daylighted section of the river. Baby eastern blacknose dace and tessellated darter have been spotted in the river in addition to trout. In addition, wood frogs, eastern painted turtles, and redbreast sunfish live in the river too. All of these species have been hurt by the <b>industrialization</b> of the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Poland from 1945 to 1989 spans {{the period of}} Soviet {{communist}} dominance imposed {{after the end of}} World War II over what had become the Polish People's Republic. These years, while featuring general <b>industrialization</b> and urbanization and many improvements in the standard of living in Poland, were marred by social unrest and severe economic difficulties.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Central Troy Historic District is, {{particularly}} in its earlier years, the history of Troy itself. Until the later 19th century, the present downtown area was the city. Two devastating fires, along with changes in the economy brought about by <b>industrialization,</b> shaped the district into today's architecturally diverse downtown.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} French rule {{coincided with the}} start of the Industrial Revolution in Belgium. Use of {{mechanical}} production techniques was encouraged by the French state. The government particularly encouraged <b>industrialization</b> of Belgian industries of military use, such as the cannon foundries at Liège.|$|E
5|$|Villermé {{published}} {{works on}} the conditions in prisons in France, {{and the benefits of}} helping prisoners return to outside life when their sentences ended. Another concerned the role of <b>industrialization</b> on the general health and quality of life of working class people. His best known work was concerned with workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries, including the children that worked in the mills.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of <b>industrialization</b> in the 19th century, riverways beneath the Metacomet Ridge were dammed to provide power as the labor force {{expanded}} in nearby cities and towns. Logging to provide additional fuel for mills further denuded the ridges. Traprock and sandstone were quarried from the ridge for paving stones and architectural brownstone, either used locally or shipped via rail, barge, and boat.|$|E
5|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} <b>industrialization</b> was pollution. Brick firing {{produced}} {{particulate air pollution}} and paint-making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain swill. The worst pollution was coal dust and smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. The greatest number of complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes. In spite of this, pollution control was hindered {{by a desire to}} promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate in industrial districts.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{component}} of Bo's Chongqing model concerned the city's economic policies. Just {{as he had done}} in Liaoning, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowering corporate income tax rates (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and <b>industrialization.</b> He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.|$|E
5|$|Between 1975 and 1990, real {{per capita}} income fell by more than 20%, wiping out almost three decades of {{economic}} development. The manufacturing industry, which had experienced a period of uninterrupted growth until the mid-1970s, began a process of continuous decline. The extreme dependence on state support of the many protected industries exacerbated the sharp fall of the industrial output. The degree of <b>industrialization</b> {{at the start of}} the 1990s was similar to its level in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Biotechnology in {{the general}} sense has been an {{important}} part of biology since the late 19th century. With the <b>industrialization</b> of brewing and agriculture, chemists and biologists became aware of the great potential of human-controlled biological processes. In particular, fermentation proved a great boon to chemical industries. By the early 1970s, a wide range of biotechnologies were being developed, from drugs like penicillin and steroids to foods like Chlorella and single-cell protein to gasohol—as well as a wide range of hybrid high-yield crops and agricultural technologies, the basis for the Green Revolution.|$|E
5|$|David Jewett Waller Sr. (January 26, 1815 – December 7, 1893) was an American Presbyterian minister, entrepreneur, {{landowner}} {{and civic}} leader {{who lived in}} the American state of Pennsylvania. He also helped build several local railroads, such as the North and West Branch Railway and also owned many coal mines. By the time of his death, {{he was one of the}} most well-known people in northeastern Pennsylvania. He helped increasing the population and <b>industrialization</b> of Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. He also organized and created a number of churches in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and 1920s, oil {{exploration}} and production continued to expand and stabilize. Oil production became established in North Texas, Central Texas, the Panhandle, and the Permian Basin in western Texas. The finds in North Texas, beginning with the 1917 strike in Ranger west of Dallas-Fort Worth, were particularly significant, bringing substantial <b>industrialization</b> to the area. Texas soon became dominant as the nation's leading oil producer. By 1940, Texas production was twice that of California, the next largest U.S. producer.|$|E
5|$|Exploration of salt domes {{across the}} plains of the Texas Gulf Coast took off with major oil fields opening at Sour Lake in 1902, Batson in 1903, Humble in 1905, and Goose Creek (modern Baytown) in 1908. Pipelines and {{refineries}} were built throughout much of Southeast Texas, leading to substantial <b>industrialization,</b> particularly around Houston and the Galveston Bay. The first offshore oilfield in the state opened in 1917 at Black Duck Bay on the Goose Creek field, although serious offshore exploration did not begin until the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Haifa's {{development}} owed much to British {{plans to}} make it a central port and hub for Middle-East crude oil. The British Government of Palestine developed the port and built refineries, thereby facilitating the rapid development of the city as a center for the country's heavy industries. Haifa was also among the first towns to be fully electrified. The Palestine Electric Company inaugurated the Haifa Electrical Power Station already in 1925, opening the door to considerable <b>industrialization.</b> The State-run Palestine Railways also built its main workshops in Haifa.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{due to its}} {{northern}} location, the peninsula's population had been sparse: in 1913, for example, only about 13,000–15,000 people lived there; mostly along the shores. However, {{the discovery of the}} vast natural resource deposits and <b>industrialization</b> efforts led to an explosive population growth during the Soviet times. By 1970, the population of the peninsula was around 799,000. The trend reverted in the 1990s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The population of the whole Murmansk Oblast went down from 1,150,000 in 1989 to 890,000 in 2002 to 795,000 in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Humans have {{inhabited}} {{the area for}} several millennia, with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century. In the late 19th century, European-American settlement intensified after a gold rush in the Black Hills {{and the construction of}} railroads from the east. Encroaching miners and settlers triggered a number of Indian wars, ending with the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890. Key events in the 20th century included the Dust Bowl and Great Depression, increased federal spending during the 1940s and 1950s for agriculture and defense, and an <b>industrialization</b> of agriculture that has reduced family farming.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, another lumber merchant, William Hoge, {{acquired}} {{ownership of}} the mansion. Under similar circumstances to those of nearby Abingdon, properties surrounding Colross underwent <b>industrialization</b> {{with the construction of}} a warehouse complex and ancillary industrial buildings associated with Alexandria Hay & Grain. The mansion at Colross became a storage facility within a lumber yard operated by another planing mill owner. In 1927, the mansion and the adjacent warehouses were substantially damaged by a tornado, making the mansion uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the nineteenth century, common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father. However, {{the economic and social}} changes that occurred during the nineteenth century lead to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family. <b>Industrialization</b> separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children. Important social changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.|$|E
5|$|In May 1969, {{discontent with}} Krieger's {{economic}} policies led to riots {{in the cities}} of Corrientes, Rosario and Córdoba. Krieger was removed, but the Onganía administration was unable to agree on an alternative economic policy. By 1970, the authorities were no longer capable of maintaining wage restraints, leading to a wage-price spiral. As the economy started to languish and import substitution <b>industrialization</b> ran out of steam, urban migration slowed. Per capita income fell, {{and with it the}} standard of living. Perón’s third term of office was characterized by an expansive monetary policy, which resulted in an uncontrolled rise in the level of inflation.|$|E
5|$|In Thailand, however, {{substantial}} {{efforts to}} prevent further such occurrences had not materialized {{in the months following}} the accident. Labour activists, trade unions and workers were lobbying for the creation of an independent occupational health and safety institute. Social critics pointed out that the accident, along with several prior disasters such as the Kader toy factory fire, was part of a trend in which the country's rapid <b>industrialization</b> resulted in increasing health and environmental hazards due to poor regulations and lack of official willingness to tackle the issue.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Government of the State of São Paulo planned {{to open a}} new {{research}} center in the interior of the state to promote development and <b>industrialization</b> in the region, and commissioned Zeferino Vaz, founder of the University of São Paulo's School of Medicine in Ribeirão Preto, to organize it. In parallel, a medical school was being planned in Campinas, a demand from the local population that dated from the early 1940s. The School of Medicine of Campinas was created by law in 1959, but actual implementation never took place.|$|E
5|$|In time, the {{ineffectiveness}} of the CIP {{began to}} concern the Eisenhower administration, who {{were worried about}} the lack of <b>industrialization.</b> The corruption that permeated the initiative remained a problem. The rural peasants of Vietnam, who comprised more than 80% of the population, were unaffected by the aid package except for the resentment that it instilled in them when they observed the relative affluence of their city counterparts compared to their own impoverished state. However, the program was credited with transforming the textile industry, as 25,000 sewing machines were imported {{in the first year of}} its operation.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{half the}} world's known {{reserves}} {{are located in}} Bolivia, {{and according to the}} US Geological Survey, Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni desert has 5.4 million tons of lithium. Other important reserves are located in Chile, China, and Brazil. Since 2006 the Bolivian government have nationalized oil and gas projects and is keeping a tight control over mining its lithium reserves. Already the Japanese and South Korean governments, as well as companies from these two countries and France, have offered technical assistance to develop Bolivia's lithium reserves and are seeking {{to gain access to the}} lithium resources through a mining and <b>industrialization</b> model suitable to Bolivian interests.|$|E
5|$|Ohio River ports {{had been}} stifled by an embargo on the Confederate South and never fully {{recovered}} their economic prominence, leading the south into an economic decline. By contrast, northern Indiana experienced an economic boom when natural gas {{was discovered in}} the 1880s, which directly contributed to {{the rapid growth of}} cities such as Gas City, Hartford City, and Muncie where a glass industry developed to utilize the cheap fuel. The Indiana gas field was then the largest known in the world. The boom lasted until the early 20th century, when the gas supplies ran low. This began northern Indiana's <b>industrialization.</b>|$|E
5|$|Perón's second Five-Year Plan in 1952 favoured {{increased}} agricultural output over <b>industrialization,</b> but {{industrial growth}} and high wages {{in previous years}} had expanded the domestic demand for agrarian goods. During the 1950s, output of beef and grain fell, and the economy suffered. The policy shift toward agricultural production created a gap in income distribution, as {{the majority of those}} who worked in agriculture laboured on tiny plots, while the majority of the land was in large estates. Argentina signed trade agreements with Britain, the Soviet Union and Chile, slightly opening the market to international trade as Perón's second economic plan sought to capitalize on the country's comparative advantage in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Plunging {{itself through}} an active process of Westernization during the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan adopted Western political, {{judicial}} and military institutions and Western cultural influences integrated with its traditional culture for modern <b>industrialization.</b> The Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet. The Meiji Restoration transformed the Empire of Japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict {{to expand its}} sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin. Japan's population grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935.|$|E
