5000|$|The first paper, {{written by}} Andrew Huxley and Rolf Niedergerke, is titled [...] "Interference {{microscopy}} of living muscle fibres".

50|$|Both {{methods of}} {{holographic}} interference microscopy {{can be realized}} in a single device of the holographic <b>interference</b> <b>microscope</b> uses an optical microscope in an off-axis conventional holographic set-up, with the reference wave, which is usual for the holography, a laser as a coherent source of light, and the hologram.The “empty” object wave produced by the objective {{in the absence of}} the micro-objects under study is recorded on the hologram using the reference wave.The developed hologram is returned in its original position, and it works as a fixed optical element of the holographic <b>interference</b> <b>microscope.</b> The images appear under simultaneous observation of the real object wave disturbed by micro-object and the “empty” object wave reconstructed from the hologram. The period of the observed interference picture is adjusted just by cross shift of the hologram from its initial position.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} usable <b>interference</b> <b>microscopes</b> was {{designed}} by Dyson and manufactured by Cooke, Troughton & Simms (later Vickers Instruments), York England. This ingenious optical system achieved interference imaging without requiring polarizing elements in the beam path.|$|R

A simulation environment for optical measurement systems, especially for <b>interference</b> <b>microscopes</b> based on white-light interferometry, was designed at the Fraunhofer IPT. A raytracing module is basis for these simulations. This module maps the physical and optical path lengths. With this simulation environment the effects of external influences on the measurement result can by analyzed...|$|R
5000|$|In {{variants}} of the <b>interference</b> <b>microscope</b> where object and reference beam {{pass through the}} same objective, two images are produced of every object (one being the [...] "ghost image"). The two images are separated either laterally within the visual field or at different focal planes, {{as determined by the}} optical principles employed. These two images can be a nuisance when they overlap, since they can severely affect the accuracy of mass thickness measurements. Rotation of the preparation may thus be necessary, {{as in the case of}} DIC.|$|E
5000|$|After {{chemical}} etching, small pits {{are formed}} where the etching solution preferentially attacks the sample surface around the dislocations intercepting this surface, {{due to the}} more highly strained state of the material [...] Thus, the image features indicate points at which dislocations intercept the sample surface. In this way, dislocations in silicon, for example, can be observed indirectly using an <b>interference</b> <b>microscope.</b> Crystal orientation can {{be determined by the}} shape of the etch pits associated with the dislocations (in the case of the illustration below; 100 elliptical, 111 - triangular/pyramidal).|$|E
5000|$|Interference {{microscopy}} became relatively {{popular in}} the 1940-1970 decades but fell into disuse because {{of the complexity of}} the instrument and difficulties in both its use and in the interpretation of image data. In recent years, however, the classical <b>interference</b> <b>microscope</b> (in particular the Mach-Zehnder instrument) has been [...] "rediscovered" [...] by biologists because its main original disadvantage (difficult interpretation of translated interference bands or complex coloured images) can now be easily surmounted by means of digital camera image recording, followed by the application of computer algorithms which rapidly deliver the processed data as false-colour images of projected dry mass. Examples of computer-assisted developments of the technique are found in the application of [...] "DRIMAPS" [...] from the laboratory of Graham Dunn [...] and other recent developments of the methodology are described by Mahlmann et al. [...] Interference microscopy for industrial inspection, semiconductor inspection and surface structure analysis is highly developed and in widespread use.|$|E

5000|$|Rolf Niedergerke was {{encouraged}} to join A.F. Huxley in Cambridge University by Stämpfli, {{who had been a}} close associate of Huxley on nerve potential. Since 1951 Huxley was looking for a competent researcher for investigating the striation pattern of living skeletal muscle. Niedergerke moved to England in the autumn of 1952 as a George Henry Lewes Student with additional support from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. He was a good choice because his personal interest had been on skeletal muscle and had a good collection on the subject since his time in Göttingen. He worked using Huxley's own <b>interference</b> <b>microscope.</b> Within a year he helped to improve the technique and a research paper on the mechanism of muscle contraction was ready. At that moment almost the same observation was made by Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Authored in pairs their papers were simultaneously published in the 22 May 1954 issue of Nature. Their conclusion states that the observation: ...|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{her years}} of schooling, Franzini-Armstrong always studied very hard. She was driven, curious, and very {{interested}} in the field of science. Her parents were first-generation scientists. Franzini-Armstrong and her three brothers always knew that they wanted to purse careers in science. Their father was an atomic physicist, and he was very passionate about teaching, especially when it came to his children. Their mother was one of very few women of that time who earned her physics degree. [...] Franzini-Armstrong’s mother did not pursue a science career as she spent most of her time at home raising her four children. However, Franzini-Armstrong’s mother always strongly encouraged her to pursue a science career. Franzini-Armstrong reports, “She mother gave me total equality with my brothers in all academic questions." [...] All three of Franzini-Armstrong’s brothers pursued science careers. Her brother Paolo became a particle physicist, Carlo a medical physician who constructed the first <b>interference</b> <b>microscope</b> in Pisa, and Marco an accomplished mineralogist.|$|E
5000|$|Andrew Huxley, whom Alan Hodgkin {{described}} as [...] "wizard with scientific apparatus", had just discovered {{the mechanism of}} the nerve impulse (action potential) transmission (for which he and Hodgkin later won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963) in 1949 using his own design of voltage clamp, and was looking for an associate who could properly dissect out muscle fibres. Upon recommendation of a close friend Robert Stämpfli, a German physician Rolf Niedergerke joined him at the University of Cambridge in 1952. By then he realised that the conventionally used phase contrast microscope was not suitable for fine structures of muscle fibres, and thus developed his own <b>interference</b> <b>microscope.</b> Between March 1953 and January 1954 they executed their research. Huxley recollected {{that at the time}} the only person who ever thought of sliding filaments before 1953 was Dorothy Hodgkin (later winner of the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry). He spent the summer of 1953 at Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, to use electron microscope there. There he met Hugh Huxley and Hanson with whom he shared data and information on their works. They parted with an agreement that they would keep in touch, and when their aim is achieved, they would publish together, if they ever [...] "reached similar conclusions".|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of electronics, computers, and software to interferometry has enabled enormous improve-ments in optical metrology.

40|$|A wear {{measurement}} technique {{based on the}} comparison of local surface heights has been developed. The method {{makes it possible to}} measure wear on asperity level. By comparing two roughness measurements before and after a wear experiment, the developed algorithms are used in a semi-online wear measurement system (an integration of a pin-on-disk and an <b>interference</b> <b>microscope).</b> The system consists of a controllable table with three degrees of freedom (in-plane motions x–y and a rotation θ), a white-light <b>interference</b> <b>microscope</b> (height and spatial resolutions of 1 nm and 1 μm, respectively) and a device for the generation of the wear track {{as well as for the}} friction measurements. The table is stopped before and after a certain number of rotations so that roughness measurements can be made with the white-light <b>interference</b> <b>microscope</b> on a certain spot. By using the developed image-processing algorithms, differences between the obtained successive surface images can give semi-online information about the amount of wear on asperity level. Wear results are correlated to the friction force data at that specific moment. With this approach a better understanding of wear phenomena is possible...|$|E

40|$|We propose changing-OPD (optical path difference) {{measurement}} technique {{which can be}} built in a scanning white-light <b>interference</b> <b>microscope.</b> The technique uses a laser beam introduced around an optical axis of the <b>interference</b> <b>microscope.</b> The laser beam reflected by a reference mirror in an objective lens and the laser beam reflected by a specimen surface make interferograms at an observing plane. These interferograms are continuously captured by a high-speed CCD line camera during a vertical scanning. Changing light intensities at two pixels having different phase and different modulations are normalized as having unity amplitude, and then subtraction and sum of them are calculated. From the calculated values changing phase is calculated and then change of OPD is also calculated after every interferogram capturing. To check accuracy of the proposed technique we carried out an experiment using a precision vertical scanning stage. After a 96 μm vertical scanning, total changed OPD at different portions on the specimen surface are calculated and estimated having less than 10 nm in difference...|$|E

The proposed ICM combines the respective advantages of simultaneous phase shifting interferometry and bipolar differential confocal microscopy to obtain high axis resolution, large dynamic range, and reduce the sensitivity to vibration and reflectance disturbance seamlessly. A compact single body spatial phase shifter is added to capture four phase-shifted interference signals simultaneously without time delay and construct a stable and space-saving simplified <b>interference</b> confocal <b>microscope</b> system.

40|$|International audiencePhase-shifting {{interferometry}} {{based on}} the integrating-bucket technique with sinusoidal phase modulation is studied theoretically and demonstrated experimentally to obtain phase maps from double-beam interferometers. The method uses four frames obtained by integration of the time-varying intensity in an interference pattern during the four quarters of the modulation period. An optimum sinusoidal phase modulation is found to minimize {{the effect of the}} additive noise. The absolute accuracy of the phase measurements is discussed. Possible applications of the method are demonstrated with two <b>interference</b> <b>microscopes</b> with which the phase modulation is achieved by sinusoidal oscillation of a mirror attached to a piezoelectric transducer and by sinusoidal birefringence modulation with a photoelastic modulator. In both experimental arrangements, phase images can be produced in real time at a rate of several hertz. Noise measurements are reported and compared with theory...|$|R

For the calibration several stylus instruments, and <b>interference</b> <b>microscopes</b> based on different measuring principles, were used. The comparison shows that the participating laboratories are able, in general, to determine the groove depth with uncertainties ranging from a few nanometres for a groove of 30 nm nominal depth to some tens of nanometres for a groove of 3200 nm. At 3200 nm the scatter of measurements between the participants is characterized by a standard deviation of 40 nm, a value considered unsatisfactory for calibrations at a primary level...|$|R

40|$|Determination of the {{refractive}} index of liquids by the <b>interference</b> <b>microscope</b> {{was made possible}} by the use of a specially constructed holder for the liquid. This ensures a permanent lateral separation between the reference and the object areas and, as the depth of the object area is continuously increasing, a system of fringes is observed.
