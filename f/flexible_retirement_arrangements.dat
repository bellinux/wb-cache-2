We analyse the flexibility of an existing pension arrangement in the Netherlands, characterised by a subsistence-level pay-as-you-go state pension combined with a supplementary occupational pension. We use the actual rules of a large occupational pension fund, the state pension and the tax system to calculate net replacement rates at ages 60 to 70 in full and partial retirement scenarios. We find that partial retirement results in a smoother income path and encourages employees to defer their pension claims beyond age 65. Moreover, while occupational pensions give close to actuarially fair rewards for continued full-time or part-time work, the state pension does not. This makes postponing retirement less attractive for low-income groups in particular...|$|E

30|$|Our results {{challenge}} the traditional model of full-time work and timely retirement, {{and suggest that}} flexible work arrangements (either full- or part-time) later in life may have significant well-being benefits. We hope that these results will inform the discussion about {{the potential benefits of}} <b>flexible</b> work and <b>retirement</b> <b>arrangements,</b> both in terms of fiscal burdens and the well-being of citizens. In addition to the administrative and implementation costs, changing employment and retirement schemes and allowing more labor market flexibility will likely have transactions costs, {{at least in the short}} run. For example, both employers and employees may face bargaining costs related to negotiating the flexible work arrangements which are optimal for both sides. Employers may moreover incur additional costs related to restructuring tasks to accommodate part-time work. Yet, the long-run fiscal benefits, as well as those to aggregate well-being – which our results suggest are quite large – make such policy changes worth considering in many countries. While this analysis is limited to Europe and the U.S., it may also have implications for other countries.|$|R

40|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>retirement</b> - that is, the {{opportunity}} to choose oneÃ¢â¬â¢s own personal retirement age - serves as a hedge against pension risk and provides insurance to workers facing health or productivity shocks. This paper discusses three conditions to provide insurance through <b>flexible</b> <b>retirement.</b> <b>Flexible</b> <b>retirement</b> and <b>flexible</b> pension schemes are in practice closely linked because of imperfect capital markets and institutional restrictions. First, {{it should be possible}} to adjust the pension starting date at limited cost. This condition is gradually being fulfilled, as many countries are moving towards more actuarially neutral pension schemes. Second, individuals should be willing to adjust their labour supply in case of a wealth shock. This condition seems largely fulfilled, although the available empirical evidence suggests that the framing of pension wealth is at least as important as the income effect. Third, the labour market should be able to deal with <b>flexible</b> individual <b>retirement</b> decisions. This condition is gaining importance, but has not yet received much attention in the literature. Institutions often hamper employment past the ‘standard retirement age’. Moreover, the hiring rates of older workers are low and their unemployment duration is high. Institutional reforms facilitating <b>flexible</b> <b>retirement</b> opportunities are desirable from an insurance perspective. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} approach to <b>flexible</b> <b>retirement</b> (e. g. NDC) neglects {{the impact of}} asymmetric information on actuarial fairness (neutrality).

40|$|In 1973 the {{government}} of the Federal Republic plans to introduce a <b>flexible</b> <b>retirement</b> age. According to this new law, old age pensions can be paid already to people who are 63 years of age instead of 65 as at present. The government thus hopes to do more justice to the difference in capacity for work of elderly insured people and to the lact that the decline of life of humans depends to a certain extent on the occupational requirements demanded of them.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} Individual <b>Retirement</b> <b>Arrangements</b> (IRA) {{and their}} tax incentives. Many workers covered by employer-sponsored retirement plans {{do not work}} long enough with one employer {{to be entitled to}} a pension. Others may be covered by a profit-sharing plan to which the employer may have little or no profits to contribute. Since these individuals were "covered" by a retirement plan, they were ineligible to make tax-deductible contributions to a tax-sheltered Individual <b>Retirement</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (IRA). Many observers considered this a tax inequity and felt that all employees should be eligible to establish their own IRAs or make tax-deductible contributions to their employer's plan. Congress responded to this situation by approving retirement savings incentives for all workers as part of the tax cut bill (H. R. 4242). All workers, whether or not covered by an employer pension plan, are now permitted tax deductible contributions to IRAs up to $ 2, 000 a year...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{conclusions}} of this thesis is that collective pension funds are potentially welfare improving, even if contributions are distortionary and even if individuals face positively correlated wage and equity risks. By disconnecting individual contributions and benefits, the pension fund is able to smooth shocks over and beyond {{the life cycle of}} single generations. By adapting its investment policy to the risk-bearing capacity of the participants, the fund can in principle ensure that labour-supply distortions are overcompensated by risk-sharing gains. The thesis also contributes to the existing economic literature on portfolio and retirement choice. This literature argues that <b>flexible</b> <b>retirement</b> may serve as a hedge against unforeseen outcomes, justifying more risky asset portfolios during working life. The conclusion that emerges from the thesis is that this positive relation between risk taking and <b>flexible</b> <b>retirement</b> is weakened once uncertainty about labour income is recognized. Apart from facilitating risk sharing, collective pensions can also exploit the benefits of redistribution. Indeed, this thesis shows that introducing a flexible pension take-up can increase welfare if the initial pension scheme contains within-cohort redistribution. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The peasant <b>retirement</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{known in}} Austria as Ausgedinge, is {{established}} by the transfer of a farm holding to an heir {{in exchange for the}} lifelong provision of shelter, food and other services to the retirees. Since the retirement of the old peasant is closely linked to the marriage of the successor, this arrangement leads to a specific stem-family household in which the head-of-household position rests with the younger generation. The article compares the frequency of <b>retirement</b> <b>arrangements</b> across a wide range of Austrian villages and small towns, controlling for age distribution as well as the various structural and cultural characteristics of these units. The data used are census-type parish registers (soul books) from the early seventeenth to the late nineteenth century. Households with <b>retirement</b> <b>arrangements</b> are found to be rare; only a small pro-portion of the elderly were formally retired. The increase of retirement ar-rangements during the nineteenth century cannot be attributed to changes in age distribution but rather, to increasing wealth in specific agricultural areas. Moreover, the data suggest that in case of the death of a spouse, retirement was increasingly preferred over remarriage.
