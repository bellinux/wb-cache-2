40|$|Abstract. We have {{performed}} photometric CCD {{observations of the}} giant and horizontal branches of the globular cluster 1, and of the giant branch of cluster 3, in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The observations were performed in the V and I standard broad-band filters {{as well as through}} two narrow-band filters especially designed to distinguish between carbon and M type stars. The AGB is richly populated with carbon-rich stars, and all of them are considerably below the theoretical lower luminosity limit for such stars. If the <b>Fornax</b> <b>clusters</b> are interpreted as resembling an earlier epoch of the Galactic globular clusters, the low luminosities of the carbon stars therefore point to a larger role of the low-mass stars in the chemical enrichment of our Galaxy. The giant branches of the <b>Fornax</b> <b>clusters</b> are much broader than canonical giant branches in Galactic globulars, and the AGB is more well populated. We suggest that the morphology and stellar population of the giant branches indicate that the dwarf galaxies are ≈ 3 Gyr younger than the Galactic halo, which in turn seems to be ≈ 3 Gyr younger than the Galactic globular clusters. ...|$|R
50|$|The Group {{is forming}} from {{the merger of}} a number of sub-groups. The group is {{predicted}} to be in an early stage of formation and exhibits a high number of early type galaxies. The sub-groups involved in the merger include the <b>Fornax</b> I <b>Cluster,</b> the Eridanus <b>Cluster</b> (or <b>Fornax</b> II <b>Cluster)</b> and the Dorado Group. In some studies these have been broken down into further sub-groups including the Eridanus Group, the NGC 1407 Group and the NGC 1332 Group. Bright individual galaxies which are members of the group include NGC 1407 (the brightest), NGC 1332, NGC 1309 and NGC 1209.|$|R
40|$|We use {{a highly}} {{homogeneous}} {{set of data}} from 132 early-type galaxies in the Virgo and <b>Fornax</b> <b>clusters</b> in order to study {{the properties of the}} globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF). The globular cluster system of each galaxy was studied using a maximum likelihood approach to model the intrinsic GCLF after accounting for contamination and completeness effects. The results presented here update our Virgo measurements and confirm our previous results showing a tight correlation between the dispersion of the GCLF and the absolute magnitude of the parent galaxy. Regarding the use of the GCLF as a standard candle, we have found that the relative distance modulus between the Virgo and <b>Fornax</b> <b>clusters</b> is systematically lower than the one derived by other distance estimators, and in particular it is 0. 22 mag lower than the value derived from surface brightness fluctuation measurements performed on the same data. From numerical simulations aimed at reproducing the observed dispersion {{of the value of the}} turnover magnitude in each galaxy cluster we estimate an intrinsic dispersion on this parameter of 0. 21 mag and 0. 15 mag for Virgo and Fornax respectively. All in all, our study shows that the GCLF properties vary systematically with galaxy mass showing no evidence for a dichotomy between giant and dwarf early-type galaxies. These properties may be influenced by the cluster environment as suggested by cosmological simulations. Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ.

40|$|The Sersic r^(1 /n) index n of an {{elliptical}} galaxy (or bulge) {{has recently been}} shown to correlate strongly (r= 0. 8) with a galaxy's central velocity dispersion.
