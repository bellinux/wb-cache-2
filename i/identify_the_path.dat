50|$|It {{has been}} theorized that λ max-shifts {{might have been}} {{required}} as human ancestors started to switch from leading nocturnal lifestyles to more diurnal lifestyles. This caused their vision to adjust to various twilight settings over time. To <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> from which short wavelength opsins evolved, increases in absolute max values were used by researchers with a limitation of approximately |Δλmax|<25 per step. This allows for subdivision of the 1032 potential pathways that were generated by analysis of first mutations beginning {{with any of the}} stable mutants: F46T, F49L, F86L, T93P, A114G or S118T to be narrowed down to 335 potential pathways.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{considerable}} progress {{during the}} course of the past decade, it remains a controversial question how an optimal path should be defined and identified in stochastic road networks. In other words, there is no unique definition of an optimal path under uncertainty. One possible and common answer to this question is to find a path with the minimum expected travel time. The main advantage of using this approach is that efficient shortest path algorithms introduced for the deterministic networks can be readily employed to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> with the minimum expected travel time in a stochastic network. However, the resulting optimal path identified by this approach may not be reliable, because this approach fails to address travel time variability. To tackle this issue some researchers use distribution of travel time instead of expected value of it so they find the probability distribution of total traveling time using different optimization methods such as dynamic programming and Dijkstra's algorithm [...] These methods use stochastic optimization, specifically stochastic dynamic programming to find the shortest path in networks with probabilistic arc length. It should be noted that the concept of travel time reliability is used interchangeably with travel time variability in the transportation research literature, so that, in general, one can say that the higher the variability in travel time, the lower the reliability would be, and vice versa.|$|E

We present in this paper an algorithm, DOMINANT-EDGE PATHWAY, for identifying a thermodynamically favored dominant-edge pathway forming a particular metabolite product from a particular reactant in a metabolic reaction network. The metabolic network is represented as a graph based on the stoichiometry of the reactions. The problem is formulated to first <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> between the reactant and product with a limiting reaction based on Gibbs free energy changes, and then to augment this path with supplementary pathways with the goal of balancing the overall stoichiometry.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{merits of}} shareholder versus stakeholder models of corporate governance {{have long been}} contested. Liberalisation and globalisation of financial markets resulted in the suggestion of potential convergence along shareholder principles. Research has attempted to justify the supremacy of one system over the other, however empirical evidence is weak. The culturally embedded nature of corporate governance within institutional frameworks suggests that transposition of single features may be inappropriate and may disrupt the overall efficiencies of a national system. The proportionality debate remains a key limiting factor in attempts at alignment. This paper will review {{the current state of}} the debate. It will employ comparative analysis to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> dependent evolution of corporate governance, contrasting differences within and between specific shareholder and stakeholder models.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} routing connections with QoS requirements across one or more networks, when the information available for making routing decisions is inaccurate and expressed in some probabilistic manner.

40|$|In {{this article}} I revisit the {{well-known}} empirical problem of manner of motion verbs with directional complements in Spanish. I present some data that, to my mind, {{had not received}} due attention in previous studies and I show that some manner of motion verbs actually allow directionals with the preposition a, while all of them allow them with prepositions like hacia or hasta. I argue that this pattern {{is due to a}} principle that states that every syntactic feature must be identified by lexical insertion, the Exhaustive Lexicalisation Principle. The crucial problem with directional complements is that the Spanish preposition a is locative, in contrast with English to, and, therefore, unable to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>Path</b> feature. Some verbs license the directional with a because they can lexicalise Path altogether with the verb; all verbs can combine with hasta or hacia because these prepositions lexicalise Path.
