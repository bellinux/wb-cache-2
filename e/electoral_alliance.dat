5|$|Folkvord has a {{daughter}} named Jorunn Folkvord {{who works as a}} teacher {{and is a member of}} the Norwegian teachers union, Union of Education Norway. She was notable for her far-left political activities in Norway, having membership status in the Workers' Communist Party and the Red <b>Electoral</b> <b>Alliance.</b> She took part in several notable protests during the 1990s, in one case being arrested by the police. She was also the Leader of Red Youth during the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|At the Red Electoral Alliance's city {{convention}} Folkvord {{was elected}} their lead candidate in Oslo for the 2005 election. Folkvord, along with Torstein Dahle, {{were the only}} representatives from the party who had a chance of gaining a seat in parliament. Jens Stoltenberg, leader of the Labour Party, was negative towards {{the idea of having}} any representatives from the Red <b>Electoral</b> <b>Alliance</b> in parliament, saying that the voters should do anything in their power to stop them from earning a seat in parliament. When the votes were counted Folkvord did not gain a seat in parliament.|$|E
5|$|By February 2001 the Workers' Communist Party {{proposed}} making Folkvord the {{new leader}} of the Red <b>Electoral</b> <b>Alliance,</b> since Myhre would resign if {{he was elected to}} parliament. While the majority of the members wanted a female leader after the departure of Myhre, his supporters were perfectly aware that Folkvord could lose the nomination and a campaign was started to make him deputy leader. The main problem for Folkvord's opposition was his close ties to the Workers' Communist Party. At the convention Myhre was re-elected the party's party leader, with Folkvord and Chris Hartmann stepping in as the party's new deputy leaders. Myhre did not become a member of parliament.|$|E
50|$|The {{end of the}} pacto {{revealed}} an old reality about Bolivian politics. To achieve power, broad <b>electoral</b> <b>alliances</b> must be established; yet, <b>electoral</b> <b>alliances</b> have never translated into stable or effective ruling coalitions. On the contrary, <b>electoral</b> <b>alliances</b> have exacerbated the tensions built into a complex system. Thus, once in power, whoever controls the executive must search for mechanisms or coalitions such as the pacto {{to be able to}} govern. This search was the single most important challenge facing Bolivian politicians into the 1980s.|$|R

5|$|Erling Folkvord (born 15 June 1949) is a Norwegian {{politician}} for the Red party, and {{a former}} member of the Parliament of Norway. A revolutionary socialist, he was one of the leading members of the Workers' Communist Party and the Red <b>Electoral</b> <b>Alliance</b> before they merged to form Red. He sat as a member of the Parliament of Norway from 1993 to 1997, becoming the first socialist to the left of the Socialist Left Party and the Labour Party in parliament since 1961. He later lost his position in 1997, and has been a candidate for parliament ever since. He has been a member of the Oslo City Council from 1983 to 1993, and again since 1999. Folkvord has become one of the best-known Norwegian politicians on the left who is not connected with the Labour Party and the Socialist Left Party.|$|E
5|$|Folkvord {{is the son}} {{of school}} {{principal}} Sverre Folkvord and housewife Eldrid Kjesbu. He finished secondary school earning the examen artium degree in Trondheim and then started studies to become a social worker at the Social School of Trondheim. By 1976 he was the leader of the national Social Agencies Union serving until 1978. In 1982, along with fellow Red <b>Electoral</b> <b>Alliance</b> member Harald Stabell, Folkvord sued Oslo's social-office leading figures, Signe M. Stray Ryssdal and Marit Moe. They accused them of misconduct and of making a false accusation which led to an innocent man going to prison. These accusations eventually led to a police investigation into the matter. After finding no proof of their accusations, Moe sued Folkvord and Stabell for defamatatory charges made against her, but she abstained from pursuing this in court.|$|E

5|$|On 27 February 2007 Folkvord {{announced}} he would seek another term in the City Council. Folkvord was re-elected lead candidate for the municipal election at the party convention. In March 2007 the Red <b>Electoral</b> <b>Alliance</b> and the Workers' Communist Party merged and established Red. By 3 September, six {{days before the election}} day, Red earned its best showing ever in Oslo earning 4.4% in an opinion poll — an increase of 0.3% from the previous election. When the votes for the municipality of Oslo were counted the party had managed to gain three seats on the City Council, with Folkvord's position secure. At national level Red had received 1.9% and 2.1% for the municipal and county elections respectively.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{predecessor}} to the Vlaams Blok was the People's Union, {{which was}} founded in 1954 as the successor to the Christian Flemish People's Union <b>electoral</b> <b>alliance,</b> that had successfully run for election earlier the same year. The party had been careful to choose its leaders from nationalist circles that had not collaborated with the Nazis. While Flemish separatists had been suspicious of the People's Union since its outset, it became clear by the 1970s that the party had moved to a moderate left-liberal course, which led to the defection of its more radical members. The remaining nationalist hardliners finally rejected the party's participation in a new five-party government coalition in 1977, and particularly the Egmont pact, believing it had conceded too much to the francophone government parties.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing his}} {{position}} in parliament, Folkvord went through a short-period of obscurity. He once again earned media attention when he publicly denounced the Lund Commission. The commission revealed there had been extensive surveillance of Norwegian communists, socialists and other radicals by the Norwegian Police Security Service. Folkvord demanded to be shown his own documentation created during the surveillance. In 1999 Folkvord topped his party's list of candidates running for {{a seat in the}} City Council. Folkvord was successful and earned a seat on the City Council while the party noted an increase of 1.3%. Folkvords main goal during the campaign was to earn a third seat for the Red <b>Electoral</b> <b>Alliance,</b> he failed to do so though the party held its two seats on the City Council. The party earned 2% and 2.1% of the vote in the county and municipal elections of 1999.|$|E

5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} {{concluded}} {{that it was the}} unity of the opposition parties against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that made the difference. The victory is attributed to the <b>electoral</b> <b>alliance</b> between DMK and Rajaji. Even though Congress had done an effective job of managing the state of Madras, the effective grass roots campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated the Congress and its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the United Front was so large {{that they were able to}} win an absolute majority in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while Congress could not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to the fact that the United Front was able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{advanced}} tolls was {{reviewed by the}} county council on 23 October 1991, where 64 voted in favor and 19 were opposed, the latter representing the Socialist Left Party, the Red <b>Electoral</b> <b>Alliance</b> and the Progress Party. In June 1992, the county council was asked to prioritize between the Hardanger Bridge and the Triangle Link, as {{there would not be}} sufficient state grants to build both projects. Both would require between NOK200 and 300 million, and it would not be possible to start both projects in the period from 1994 to 1997. In the council meeting on 18 June 1992, a proposal to waiver prioritization was rejected. The council then, with 44 against 30 votes, chose to prioritize the Hardanger Bridge, which received most votes from the Labour and Centre Party. The Conservative Party was the only party for which all the votes were cast in favor of the Triangle Link. The Socialist Left Party's proposal to build neither received 11 votes.|$|E
25|$|Red {{was founded}} on March 7, 2007, in a merger of the Red <b>Electoral</b> <b>Alliance</b> and the Workers' Communist Party. The two parties had shared the same history for decades, because the Workers' Communist Party founded the Red <b>Electoral</b> <b>Alliance</b> as an electoral party that would promote {{communist}} and socialist values. During the national convention held by the Red <b>Electoral</b> <b>Alliance,</b> a faction within the party stated it would support the merger of the two parties if any references to communism in the new party program would be removed.|$|E

25|$|The Nationalist Movement Party {{claimed that}} they would {{consider}} an <b>electoral</b> <b>alliance</b> with the Felicity Party (SP) and the Great Union Party (BBP), but said nothing regarding the Conservative Ascension Party (MYP), which had long called for a union of nationalist parties. In the end, the MHP decided not to pursue a formal <b>electoral</b> <b>alliance,</b> but said it was open to defectors from any party. The MYP subsequently announced support for the MHP. The BBP has since decided to contest the election under the SP banner, and will thus be absent from the ballot papers. The Nation and Justice Party (MİLAD) planned to join the SP and BBP, {{but it did not}} actualise. The new <b>electoral</b> <b>alliance</b> between these parties was named the National Alliance (Millî İttifak). The candidate lists were drawn up such that BBP candidates were placed top in electoral districts in which they won more votes than the SP in 2011, while SP candidates were placed top in provinces in which the SP had beaten the BBP in 2011. This meant that an SP candidate was placed first in 55 provinces, while a BBP candidate was placed first in 30. The remaining positions subsequently alternated between SP and BBP candidates.|$|E

40|$|Electoral {{engineering}} determines {{prospects for}} centripetal politics in postconflict societies. Lebanon's postwar elections have been contested by interethnic <b>electoral</b> <b>alliances</b> in multi-ethnic <b>electoral</b> districts.

Democratization, peace building and ethnic harmony have been the main victims of these cross-ethnic alliances, however.

25|$|GreenLeft {{was founded}} as a mid-sized {{party to the}} left of the Labour Party (PvdA). In the 1994 elections, the Socialist Party (SP) also entered parliament. GreenLeft now takes a central {{position}} in the Dutch left between the socialist SP, which is more to the left, and the social-democratic PvdA, which is more to the centre. This position is exemplified by the call of Femke Halsema to form a left-wing coalition after the 2006 elections, knowing that such a coalition is only possible with GreenLeft. The <b>electoral</b> <b>alliance</b> between SP and GL in the 1998, 2002 and 2006 elections, and between GreenLeft and PvdA in the 2004 European elections are examples of this position.
