This array of microlenses is an array of microwells covered with a thin PDMS membrane that are connected by microfluidic channels. The deformation of the PDMS membrane on the microlenses is tuned by <b>external</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> that is introduced through the microchannels. The degree of deformation of the PDMS membrane can be estimated from the focal length of the microlens, and the corresponding mechanical strain that is caused can be calculated from finite element simulation. We demonstrate the capability of this array of microlenses as a general platform for studying the influence of mechanical strain on adherent cells by using NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells as our models...|$|E
40|$|Transport of nutrients, CO 2, methane, {{and oxygen}} plays an {{important}} ecological role at the surface of wetland ecosystems. A possibly important transport mechanism in a water-saturated peat moss layer (usually Sphagnum cuspidatum) is nocturnal buoyancy flow, the downward flow of relatively cold surface water, and the upward flow of warm water induced by nocturnal cooling. Mathematical stability analysis showed that buoyancy flow occurs in a cooling porous layer if the system¿s Rayleigh number (Ra) exceeds 25. For a temperature difference of 10 K between day and night, a typical Ra value for a peat moss layer is 80, which leads to quickly developing buoyancy cells. Numerical simulation demonstrated that fluid flow leads to a considerable mixing of water. Temperature measurements in a cylindrical peat sample of 50 -cm height and 35 -cm diameter were {{in agreement with the}} theoretical results. The nocturnal flow and the associated mixing of the water represent a mechanism for solute transport in water-saturated parts of peat land and in other types of terrestrializing vegetation. This mechanism may be particularly important in continental wetlands, where Ra values in summer are often much larger than the threshold for fluid flow. The upper part of a living mire consists of a sponge-like layer of predominantly moss species, the acrotelm (1), with a porosity above 95 %. The green and brownish plants near the surface (Fig. 1) intercept light and fix CO 2. Further down, the older plants turn yellow and start to decay. Aerobic decay in the acrotelm takes place relatively rapidly and makes nutrients available for recycling. Below the acrotelm, a denser layer, the catotelm, is present, where the hydraulic conductivity is much lower than in the acrotelm (2), and where the decay rate is several orders of magnitude smaller due to the anoxic conditions (3). It is the peat formation (4, 5) in the slowly growing catotelm that represents a sink of atmospheric CO 2 (5, 6). The production of organic matter at the surface largely depends on the recycling of nutrients originating from decomposing plant material. Because decomposition and photosynthesis take place at different depths, the transport of oxygen, carbon compounds, and nutrients forms an important element in the functioning of the mire ecosystem. This transport takes place both inside (7) and outside the plants by diffusion and fluid flow. In this paper, we investigate a mechanism for fluid flow in a water-saturated peat moss layer, which does not depend on capillarity or an <b>external</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure.</b> During the night, the surface cools, leading to relatively cold water on top of warm water, and if the temperature drop is sufficiently large, the cold water sinks and the warm water rises. This type of flow is called buoyancy flow, and it implies convective transport of the heat and solutes carried with the water. Buoyancy flow often occurs as ``cells¿¿ consisting of adjacent regions with upward and downward flow. We studied the phenomenon in a peat moss layer by means of a mathematical model, numerical simulation, and laboratory measurements...|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} results {{from a series of}} chalk flow-through-compaction {{experiments}} performed at three effective stresses (0. 5 MPa, 3. 5 MPa and 12. 3 MPa) and two temperatures (92 ℃ and and 130 ℃). The results show that both stress and temperature are important to both chemical alteration and mechanical deformation. The experiments were conducted on cores drilled from the same block of outcrop chalks from the Obourg quarry within the Saint Vast formation (Mons, Belgium). The pore pressure was kept at 0. 7 MPa for all experiments with a continuous flow of 0. 219 M MgCl 2 brine at a constant flow rate; 1 original pore volume (PV) per day. The experiments have been performed in tri-axial cells with independent control of the <b>external</b> stress (<b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> in the confining oil), pore pressure, temperature, and the injected flow rate. Each experiment consists of two phases; a loading phase where stress-strain dependencies are investigated (approx. 2 days), and a creep phase that lasts for more than 150 - 160 days. During creep, the axial deformation was logged, and the effluent samples were collected for ion chromatography analyses. Any difference between the injected and produced water chemistry gives insight into the rock-fluid interactions that occur during flow through of the core. The observed effluent concentration shows a reduction in Mg 2 +, while the Ca 2 + concentration is increased. This, together with SEM-EDS analysis, indicates that magnesium-bearing mineral phases are precipitated leading to dissolution of calcite, an observation. This is in-line with other flow-through experiments reported earlier. The observed dissolution and precipitation are sensitive to the effective stress and test temperature. Typically. H, higher stress and temperature lead to increased concentration differences of Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + concentration changes [...] The observed strain can be partitioned additively into a mechanical and chemical driven component...|$|R

40|$|High {{pressure}} is often {{considered to be}} the cause of the high fouling propensity of reverse osmosis (RO) relative to forward osmosis (FO). Several experimental studies have shown that alginate fouling is more susceptible to cleaning in FO than in RO, but the theory that foulant compaction causes this disparity seems to be contradicted by the incompressibility of alginate hydrogels. In addition, the effect of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> on fouling in osmotic membrane desalination has never been experimentally isolated, because fixed-flux comparisons at different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures</b> require different draw solution osmotic pressures. In this study, a new approach to isolating the effect of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> on alginate fouling and cleaning is introduced: operating FO with elevated but equal feed and draw <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures.</b> The same concentration of sodium chloride is used as the draw solution in all trials to eliminate possible effects of draw solution osmotic pressure on membrane fouling or cleaning. Theoretical modeling of the effect of alginate foulant compaction on flux reveals that foulant compaction should accelerate flux decline with low salinity feeds but retard flux decline at high salinity. However, in low-salinity alginate fouling trials, for which foulant compaction should accelerate flux decline, the measured flux decline rate was not affected by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure.</b> Furthermore, when fouled membranes were cleaned by increasing the feed velocity and reducing the draw osmotic pressure, there was no apparent relationship between <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> and cleaning effectiveness. Finally, in situ visualization of foulant removal during the cleaning process revealed no difference in foulant removal mechanisms between different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures.</b> These findings demonstrate that alginate gel compaction by high feed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> does not occur and suggest that other explanations should be sought for FO's high fouling resistance relative to RO.
