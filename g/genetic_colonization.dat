40|$|Animal guts {{are often}} colonized by host-specialized {{bacterial}} species {{to the exclusion}} of other transient microorganisms, but the <b>genetic</b> basis of <b>colonization</b> ability is largely unknown. The bacterium Snodgrassella alvi is a dominant gut symbiont in honey bees, specialized in colonizing the hindgut epithelium. We developed methods for transposon-based mutagenesis in S. alvi and, using high-throughput DNA sequencing, screened genome-wide transposon insertion (Tn-seq) and transcriptome (RNA-seq) libraries to characterize both the essential genome and the genes facilitating host colonization. Comparison of Tn-seq results from laboratory cultures and from monoinoculated worker bees reveal that 519 of 2, 226 protein-coding genes in S. alvi are essential in culture, whereas 399 are not essential but are beneficial for gut colonization. Genes facilitating colonization fall into three broad functional categories: extracellular interactions, metabolism, and stress responses. Extracellular components with strong fitness benefits in vivo include trimeric autotransporter adhesins, O antigens, and type IV pili (T 4 P). Experiments with T 4 P mutants establish that T 4 P in S. alvi likely function in attachment and biofilm formation, with knockouts experiencing a competitive disadvantage in vivo. Metabolic processes promoting colonization include essential amino acid biosynthesis and iron acquisition pathways, implying nutrient scarcity within the hindgut environment. Mechanisms to deal with various stressors, such as for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks and protein quality control, are also critical in vivo. This genome-wide study identifies numerous <b>genetic</b> networks underlying <b>colonization</b> by a gut commensal in its native host environment, including some known from more targeted studies in other host-microbe symbioses...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{evidence}} {{points out}} that the capacity of organisms to acclimate or adapt to new habitat conditions basically depends on their phenomic plasticity attributes, of which their gut commensal microbiota might be an essential impact factor. Especially in aquatic organisms, which are in direct and continual contact with the aquatic environment, the complex and dynamic microbiota have significant effects on health and development. However, an understanding of the relative contribution of internal sorting (host <b>genetic)</b> and <b>colonization</b> (environmental) processes is still unclear. To understand how microbial communities differ in response to rapid environmental change, we surveyed and studied the environmental and gut microbiota of native and habitat-exchanged shrimp (Macrobrachium nipponense) using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Corresponding with microbial diversity of their living water areas, the divergence in gut microbes of lake-to-river shrimp (CK) increased, while that of river-to-lake shrimp (KC) decreased. Importantly, among the candidate environment specific gut microbes in habitat-exchanged shrimp, over half of reads were associated with the indigenous bacteria in native shrimp gut, yet more candidates presented in CK may reflect the complexity of new environment. Our results suggest that shrimp gut microbiota has high plasticity when its host faces environmental changes, even over short timescales. Further, the changes in external environment might influence the gut microbiome not just by providing environment-associated microbes directly, but also by interfering with the composition of indigenous gut bacteria indirectly...|$|R

Pronounced changes in genetic structure were associated with hatching of sexual dormant eggs after a period of absence of the newly founded populations from the active community. Despite rapid <b>colonization,</b> <b>genetic</b> differentiation among populations was fairly high with limited decay over time, suggesting long-lasting founder effects. After initial colonization, no new alleles were observed in any of the populations, and our analyses suggests that this reflects reduced establishment success of later arrivals.

40|$|In {{many plants}} and animal species, asexuals {{are more common}} in {{marginal}} habitats such as high latitudes or altitudes than their closely related sexual counterparts. Here we propose a new hypothesis to explain this pattern called "geographic parthenogenesis". In marginal habitats, populations may often exist as metapopulations with high degrees of subdivision and local extinction and recolonization, resulting in <b>genetic</b> bottlenecks during <b>colonization.</b> Our hypothesis states that such dynamics could {{play a key role}} in geographic parthenogenesis. Genetic bottlenecks and subsequent drift have stronger negative fitness consequences in sexuals than in asexuals because genetic drift leads to increased homozygosity and inbreeding depression in sexual but not in asexual populations. Migration, leading to inter-population hybridisation, may induce temporary fitness recovery in sexuals. Asexuals arising from such hybrids have an increased likelihood of invading sexual populations because they keep their high fitness, whereas the fitness of sexuals is doomed to decrease due to subsequent inbreeding and inbreeding depression. Therefore, asexuals may replace sexuals in subdivided habitats with local extinction and recolonization while they would not succeed in unstructured habitats without local turnover dynamics...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} recognition that long distance dispersal (LDD) {{plays a key role}} in establishing spatial <b>genetic</b> structure during <b>colonization.</b> Recent works, focused on short distance dispersal, demonstrated that a neutral mutation arising at the colonization front can either 'surf' with the wave front and reach high frequencies or stay near its place of origin at low frequencies. Here, we examine how LDD, and more generally the shape of the dispersal kernel, modifies this phenomenon and how the width of the colonization corridor affects the fate of the mutation. We demonstrate that when LDD events are more frequent, the 'surfing phenomenon' is less frequent, probably because any alleles can get far ahead from the colonization front and preclude the invasion by others alleles, thus leading to an attenuation of the diversity loss. We also demonstrate that the width of the colonization corridor influences the fate of the mutation, wide spaces decreasing the probability of invasion. Overall, the genetic structure of diversity resulted not only from LDD but also particularly from the shape of the dispersal kerne...|$|R

While studies on C. difficile virulence and physiology have been hindered, in the past, by lack of genetic approaches and suitable animal models, newly developed technologies and animal models allow these processes to be studied in detail. One such advance is the generation of a mouse-model of C. difficile infection. The development of this system is a major step forward in analyzing the <b>genetic</b> requirements for <b>colonization</b> and infection. While important, it is equally as important in understanding what differences exist between mice and humans. One of these differences is the natural bile acid composition. Bile acid-mediated spore germination is an important step in C. difficile colonization. Mice produce several different bile acids that are not found in humans. These muricholic acids have the potential to impact C. difficile spore germination. Here we find that the three muricholic acids (a-muricholic acid, b-muricholic acid and v-muricholic acid) inhibit C. difficile spore germination and can impact the growth of vegetative cells. These results highlight an important difference between humans and mice and may have an impact on C. difficile virulence in the mouse-model of C. difficile infection...|$|R

Screening 49 populations of D. longispina and 77 populations of D. magna, separated by distances of 1. 5 – 2180 m, we found that local genetic diversity increased with population age whereas pairwise differentiation among pools decreased with population age.

Although the genetic signatures of historical range expansions have been investigated {{in an array of}} species, the genetic consequences of natural, contemporary range expansions have received little attention, with the only studies available focusing on range expansions along a narrow front. We investigate the genetic consequences of a natural range expansion in the Mediterranean damselfly Coenagrion scitulum, which is currently rapidly expanding along a broad front in different directions.

40|$|Background: Population genetic theory {{holds that}} oceanic island populations are {{expected}} to have lower levels of genetic variation than their mainland counterparts, due to founder effect after island colonization from the continent. Cistus monspeliensis (Cistaceae) is distributed in both the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean region. Numerous phylogenetic results obtained in the last years allow performing further phylogeographic analyses in Cistus. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed sequences from multiple plastid DNA regions in 47 populations of Cistus monspeliensis from the Canary Islands (21 populations) and the Mediterranean basin (26 populations). The time-calibrated phylogeny and phylogeographic analyses yielded the following results: (1) a single, ancestral haplotype is distributed across the Mediterranean, whereas 10 haplotypes in the Canary Islands; (2) four haplotype lineages are present in the Canarian Islands; (3) multiple colonization events across the archipelago are inferred; (4) the earliest split of intraspecific lineages occurred in the Early to Middle Pleistocene (, 930, 000 years BP).

Using microsatellite markers, I sampled plants at two different scales: at regular intervals along three parallel roads spanning about 30 km, and in populations identified throughout Oregon. I also collected field-generated progeny from a subset of populations and used molecular identification of outcrossing events to estimate selfing rates in both central and peripheral populations. Dispersal patterns were similar at both scales, with non-contiguous dispersal responsible for colonization of new populations. High levels of differentiation were observed at all scales, though newly-colonized populations were more differentiated than older populations. Corvallis populations were responsible for colonization {{of a majority of}} populations throughout Oregon, while individuals from Eugene were only occasionally found in new populations. Admixture occurs between Corvallis and Eugene populations, decreasing differentiation, and potentially creating novel phenotypes and increasing evolutionary potential of populations. Selfing rates were high, but two populations in the areas of original introduction had lower rates of selfing, suggesting that selfing rates may decrease as population density and diversity increases with age.

Here, we investigate genetic diversity, genetic differentiation and small-scale genetic structure in our model system, the three geo-cytotypes of Centaurea stoebe: monocarpic diploids and polycarpic (allo) tetraploids coexist in the native range (Eurasia), but only tetraploids are reported from the invasive range (North America). For each geo-cytotype, we investigated 18 – 20 populations varying in size and habitat type (natural vs. ruderal). Population genetic analyses were conducted at eight microsatellite loci. Compared to diploids, tetraploids revealed higher genetic diversity and lower genetic differentiation, whereas both were comparable in tetraploids between both ranges. Within spatial distances of a few meters, diploid individuals were more strongly related to one another than tetraploids. In addition, expected heterozygosity in diploids increased with population size and was higher in natural than in ruderal habitats. However, neither relationship was found for tetraploids. The higher genetic diversity of tetraploid C. stoebe may have enhanced its <b>colonization</b> abilities, if <b>genetic</b> diversity is correlated with fitness and adaptive capabilities. Furthermore, the inheritance of a duplicated chromosome set as well as longevity and frequent gene flow reduces drift in tetraploids.

A Bayesian clustering analysis of the microsatellite data only partially supported the Mediterranean COI groups, likely suggesting recent admixture of formerly isolated populations. Similarly, the British localities formed a separate cluster based on microsatellite markers, which was not supported by mitochondrial DNA. Analyses based on an isolation with migration model revealed a low effective population size for the British population and suggested asymmetric gene flow, primarily from continental Western Europe to the British Isles.

40|$|This study {{represents}} the first large-scale analysis using nuclear molecular markers to assess genetic diversity {{and structure of}} Cupressus sempervirens L [...] Genetic and fossil data were combined to infer the possible role of human activity and evolutionary history in shaping the diversity of cypress populations. We analysed 30 populations with six polymorphic nuclear microsatellite markers. Dramatic reductions in heterozygosity and allelic richness were observed {{from east to west}} across the species range. Structure analysis assigned individuals to two main groups separating central Mediterranean and eastern populations. The two main groups could be further divided into five subgroups which showed the following geographical distributions: Turkey with the Greek islands Rhodes and Samos, Greece (Crete), Southern Italy, Northern Italy, Tunisia with Central Italy. This pattern of genetic structure is also supported by samova and Barrier analyses. Palaeobotanical data indicated that Cupressus was present in Italy in the Pliocene, Pleistocene and Holocene. Furthermore, our molecular survey showed that Italian cypress populations experienced bottlenecks that resulted in reduced genetic diversity and allelic richness and greater <b>genetic</b> differentiation. Recent <b>colonization</b> or introduction may also have influenced levels of diversity detected in the Italian populations, as most individuals found in this range today have multilocus genotypes that are also present in the eastern range of the species. The data reveal a new interpretation of the history of cypress distribution characterized by ancient eastern populations (Turkey and Greek islands) and a mosaic of recently introduced trees and remnants of ancient, depauperate populations in the central Mediterranean range...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{has examined the}} <b>genetic</b> consequences of <b>colonization</b> in five tree species on the Krakatau islands, Indonesia after habitat had been destroyed over a century earlier by extreme volcanic events. The Krakatau islands provide a unique, well-documented example of island colonization in the tropics. The islands are continental and lay approximately midway between Java and Sumatra; the nearest points on these landmassess to the islands being approximately 41 and 31 km, respectively. Currently the islands are covered in species poor, early seral monsoonal forest that is little disturbed by humans. With the increasing levels of habitat destruction occurring in the tropics due to human mediated environmental degradation, {{it is important to}} understand the processes involved in ecosystem restoration. This is the first study to use genetic markers to examine the genetic consequences and patterns of colonization on these islands. The final conclusions of this study are these: Species dispersal ability, distance to the islands, island positioning and ecological factors are all important in structuring genetic diversity. Species with high dispersal ability maintain higher levels of genetic diversity within populations and lower levels of differentiation between populations relative to species with poorer dispersal ability. Dispersal ability alone was not a good predictor for the effect of <b>colonization</b> on <b>genetic</b> diversity within populations as other ecological factors are also important in structuring genetic variation. Counter to expectation, most of the study species maintained equivalent or higher levels of genetic diversity on Krakatau relative to mainland sites and other islands in the Sunda Strait closer to the coast. Small plant population size and island isolation is thought to be an important factor leading to hybridization in some species...|$|R
40|$|All animals live in symbiosis. Shaped by eons of co-evolution, host-bacterial {{associations}} {{have developed}} into prosperous relationships creating mechanisms for mutual benefits to both microbe and host. No better example exists in biology than the astounding numbers of bacteria harbored by the lower gastrointestinal tract of mammals. This community of symbionts establishes a life-long habitat within the distal gut and profoundly impacts host health. Although many recent investigations {{have led to}} determination of the microbiota composition, molecular mechanisms mediating establishment and maintenance of the microbial community within the gut is poorly described. We use gnotobiotic mice to elucidate mechanisms of colonization by Bacteroides, {{one of the most}} numerically prominent genera in the intestine. We generate mutant strains of Bacteroides fragilis that lack the ability to express multiple capsular polysaccharides and demonstrate defect in colonization in competition with wild-type strain, suggesting a role for surface sugar architecture during host-symbiont mutualism. Through a functional in vivo <b>genetic</b> screen of <b>colonization,</b> we identify a novel operon from the genome of B. fragilis that is highly conserved among many sequenced intestinal Bacteroides and that mediate a species-specific colonization profile. We have named this genetic locus the commensal colonization factor (ccf). B. fragilis deleted in the ccf genes exhibit colonization defects in both germ-free and complex microbiota harboring mice. The ccf genes of B. fragilis are up-regulated during gut colonization, preferentially at the mucosal surface, supporting an in vivo function. Indeed, deletion of ccf genes leads to reduced mucosal association and a defect in bacterial occupation of colonic crypts of mice. The ability of B. fragilis to repopulate the gut after antibiotic perturbation or gastroenteritis requires expression of ccf, suggesting the niche within colonic crypts represents a colonization reservoir for the gut microbiota following environmental stress. These findings suggest a novel and evolutionarily conserved mechanism for persistent gut colonization by the Bacteroides species. ...|$|R
40|$|Coastal lagoons are {{considered}} one of the most productive areas of our planet harboring a large variety of habitats. Their transitional character, between terrestrial and marine environments, creates a very particular ecosystem with important variations of its environmental conditions. The organisms that are able to survive on these ecosystems frequently experience strong selective pressures and constrictions to gene flowwith marine populations, which could contribute to genetic divergence among populations inhabiting coastal lagoon and marine environments. Therefore, the main aims of this study are to asses the genetic diversity and population structure of Holothuria arguinensis across geographical ranges, to test the hypothesis of coastal lagoons as hotspots of genetic diversity in the Ria Formosa lagoon, and to determine the role of exporting standing genetic variation from the lagoon to open sea and their implications to recent geographical expansion events. To reach these objectives, we investigate the genetic structure of H. arguinensis using two mitochondrial DNA markers (COI and 16 S) at different spatial scales: i) small, inside Ria Formosa coastal lagoon, South Portugal; 2) large, including most of the geographical distribution of this species (South and Western Portuguese coast and Canary islands); these results will allow us to compare the genetic diversity of lagoonal and marine populations of H. arguinensis. On this framework, its recent geographical expansion events, recorded by Rodrigues (2012) and González-Wangüemert and Borrero-Pérez (2012), will be analyzed considering the potential contribution from lagoonal genetic pool. Non-significant genetic structure and high haplotypic diversity were found inside the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon. Both genes were unable to detect significant genetic differentiation among lagoonal and marine localities, suggesting a high rate of gene flow. The results supported our hypotheses that coastal lagoons are not only acting as hotspots of genetic diversity, but also contributing for the genetic variability of the species, working as a source of new haplotypes and enhancing adaptation to the high variable conditions. Different <b>genetic</b> patterns of <b>colonization</b> were found on H. arguinensis, but they must be studied more deeply...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Rare long {{distance}} dispersal events impact the demography and the genetic structure of populations. When dispersal is modelled via a dispersal kernel, one possible characterisation of long-distance dispersal {{is given by}} {{the shape of the}} tail of the kernel, i. e. its type of decay. This characteristic is known to directly act on the speed and pattern of colonization, and on the spatial structure of <b>genetic</b> diversity during <b>colonization.</b> In particular, colonization waves behave differently depending on whether the kernel decreases faster or slower than an exponential (i. e. is thin-tailed vs. fat-tailed). To interpret and extend published results on the impact of long-distance dispersal on the genetic structure of populations, we examine a classification of dispersal kernels based on the shape of their tails and formally demonstrate qualitative differences among them that can influence the predicted diversity of a propagule pool sampled far from two distinct sources. Results We show that a fat-tailed kernel leads asymptotically to a diverse propagule pool containing a balanced mixing of the propagules from the two sources, whereas a thin-tailed kernel results in all propagules originating from the closest source. We further show that these results hold for biologically relevant distances under certain circumstances, and in particular if the number of propagules is large enough, as would be the case for pollen or seeds. Conclusion To understand the impact of long-distance dispersal on the structure and dynamics of a metapopulation, it might be less important to precisely estimate an average dispersal distance than to determine if the tail of the dispersal kernel is fatter or thinner than that of an exponential function. Depending solely on this characteristic, a metapopulation will behave similarly to an island model with a diverse immigrant pool or to a stepping-stone model with migrants from closest populations. Our results further help to understand why thin-tailed dispersal kernels lead to a colonization wave of constant speed, whereas fat-tailed dispersal kernels lead to a wave of increasing speed. Our results also suggest that the diversity of the pollen cloud of a mother plant should increase with increasing isolation for fat-tailed kernels, whereas it should decrease for thin-tailed kernels. </p...|$|R

METHODS: The sample consisted of 29 cystic fibrosis patients, characterized based on anthropometric, <b>genetic</b> and bacterial <b>colonization</b> data. The patients were submitted to physical therapy sessions, involving re-education of the respiratory muscles, twice a week for four months. Spirometry, pressure manometry and anthropometry were performed before and after each session. RESULTS: Comparing baselines values to those obtained after physical therapy, increases in maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure were observed in all patients, those without any obstructive respiratory disease and those with mild obstructive respiratory disease (p < 0. 05). A positive correlation between age and maximum expiratory pressure was observed {{for most of the}} patients. Maximum inspiratory pressure correlated positively with age only in the group with mild obstructive respiratory disease (p = 0. 012; r = 0. 817). In female patients and in the group of patients without obstructive respiratory disease, a negative correlation was observed between maximum expiratory pressure and colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0. 036; r = - 0. 585). CONCLUSION: Use of the thoracic and abdominal muscle re-education technique increased respiratory muscle strength in the cystic fibrosis patients studied, a finding that underscores the importance of including physical therapy in the treatment of these patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{persistence}} of species {{is fundamental to}} the evolution of biological diversity. Species generally arise in new environments through a combination of ecological divergence and spatial isolation. Under this framework, speciation occurs through three main processes: 1) niche expansion, 2) divergent selection, and 3) the accumulation of reproductive isolating mechanisms. In this dissertation, I tested specific hypotheses about the factors governing each of these stages, using a combination of stochastic simulations and field and greenhouse experiments with life history ecotypes of common monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus DC (Phrymaceae). First, I tested the ecological and <b>genetic</b> determinants of <b>colonization</b> success in flowering plants. In particular, I used stochastic simulations to test the effect of mating system plasticity on the persistence and adaptation of colonizing populations in new environments. I found that a shift to a mixed mating strategy facilitated niche expansion by reducing extinction and promoting adaptation under a broad range of colonization scenarios. In my second and third chapters, I examined the causes and consequences of life history divergence among populations of M. guttatus in central California. In chapter two, I used comparative demography to test for local adaptation and selection on life history traits in a common garden experiment in a montane perennial environment. I found that a perennial life history strategy had the highest performance and that selection favored perennial life history traits, although the native montane perennial ecotype was not locally adapted relative to other inland perennial populations. In chapter three, I quantified multiple isolating mechanisms between a focal montane perennial population and ten other populations spanning the range of life history strategies. I found that total reproductive isolation increased linearly with life history divergence between populations. However, total isolation was achieved through a mosaic of reproductive barriers and enhancers which, individually, exhibited non-linear relationships with life history divergence. These non-linear relationships are likely due to the effects of life history and inbreeding on the evolution of specific isolating mechanisms. Taken together, this work highlights the potential for diverse evolutionary, ecological, and demographic forces to interact to determine progress during the early stages of divergence...|$|R
40|$|Infections {{caused by}} Clostridium difficile have {{increased}} steadily {{over the past}} several years. While studies on C. difficile virulence and physiology have been hindered, in the past, by lack of genetic approaches and suitable animal models, newly developed technologies and animal models allow for improved experimental detail. One such advance was the generation of a mouse-model of C. difficile infection. This system was an important step forward in the analysis of the <b>genetic</b> requirements for <b>colonization</b> and infection. Equally important is understanding the differences that exist between mice and humans. One of these differences is the natural bile acid composition. Bile acid-mediated spore germination, a process whereby a dormant spore returns to active, vegetative growth, is an important step during C. difficile colonization. Mice produce several different bile acids that are not found in humans (muricholic acids) that have the potential to impact C. difficile spore germination. In order to understand potential effects of these different bile acids on C. difficile physiology, we characterized their effects on C. difficile spore germination and growth of vegetative cells. We found that the mouse-derived muricholic acids affect germination similarly to a previously-described inhibitor of germination, chenodeoxycholic acid. Chenodeoxycholic acid was previously demonstrated to be a competitive inhibitor of C. difficile spore germination, though with what the inhibitors or activators of germination interacted was unknown. However, the inhibitory property of chenodeoxycholic acid was used in a screen to identify potential germinant receptors and led to the identification of the germination-specific, pseudoprotease, CspC, as the bile acid germinant receptor. Based on the hypothesized location of CspC within the C. difficile spore (cortex rather than inner membrane), we hypothesized that there may be differences between the order of the stages of C. difficile and Bacillus subtilis spore germination. Germination in B. subtilis, a well-studied spore-former, is divided into two genetically separable stages. Stage I is characterized by the release of dipicolinic acid (DPA) from the spore core. Stage II is characterized by cortex degradation, and stage II can be activated by the DPA released during stage I. Thus, DPA release precedes cortex degradation during B. subtilis spore germination. To understand how the different location of the C. difficile germinant receptor affects the order of DPA release and cortex degradation, we first investigated the timing of DPA release and cortex degradation during C. difficile spore germination and found that cortex degradation precedes DPA release. Based on this result and work with SpoVAC in B. subtilis, we then investigated germination under high osmolyte concentrations. Because both cortex degradation and DPA release during C. difficile spore germination are dependent on the presence of the germinant receptor and cortex degradation, the release of DPA from the core may rely on the swelling of the core upon cortex degradation...|$|R
