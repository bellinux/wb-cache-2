2500|$|Gertrude Bell {{described}} Sassoon’s ministerial {{qualities in}} another letter dated 18 December 1920:“The man I do love is Sasun Eff. {{and he is}} by far the ablest man in the Council. A little rigid, he takes {{the point of view of}} the constitutional lawyer and doesn't make quite enough allowance for the primitive conditions of the 'Iraq, but he is genuine and disinterested to the core. He has not only real ability but also wide experience and I feel touched and almost ashamed by the humility with which he seeks—and is guided by—my advice. It isn't my advice, really; I'm only echoing what Sir Percy thinks. But what I rejoice in and feel confident of is the solid friendship and esteem which exists between us. And in varying degrees <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> feeling with them all. That's something, isn't it? that's a basis for carrying out the duties of a mandatory?” ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{used the}} term {{negative}} capability to discuss the state {{in which we are}} [...] "capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason... content with half knowledge" [...] where one trusts in the heart's perceptions. He wrote later: [...] "I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of Imagination – What the imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth – whether it existed before or not – for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Idea of all our Passions as of Love they are all in their sublime, creative of essential Beauty" [...] again and again turning {{to the question of what}} it means to be a poet. [...] "My Imagination is a Monastery and I am its Monk", Keats notes to Shelley. In September 1819, Keats wrote to Reynolds [...] "How beautiful the season is now – How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it ... I never lik'd the stubbled fields as much as now – Aye, better than the chilly green of spring. Somehow the stubble plain looks warm – in the same way as some pictures look warm – this struck me so much in my Sunday's walk that I composed upon it". The final stanza of his last great ode: [...] "To Autumn" [...] runs: ...|$|E

6000|$|Jimmy smiled. [...] "Not a great deal. Only a {{persistence}} in your original policy. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> rather a fancy {{that you and}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing in our minds." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{appealed to}} for the latest news by a full score before I could reach the rendezvous; but to all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> reply, that <b>I</b> was in {{government}} service and could not delay.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{right as}} you," [...] and the courageous girl clambered {{up on the}} shaky {{platform}} until {{it was possible for}} her to look over the palisade.|$|E
6000|$|Hip. Oh heavens! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sense too: your hand, [...] Methinks, {{goes through}} me; I feel it at my heart, [...] And find it pleases, though it pains me.|$|E
6000|$|... "That ain't {{altogether}} certain, lad. The lawyer thinks, and Jerry and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> idee, {{that if he}} owns up to {{the whole}} thing like a little man, {{it may be possible}} to have sentence suspended during good behavior." ...|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{density of}} Spencers in present-day England is in Nottinghamshire, followed by Derbyshire. Derby and Notts were closely connected {{at the time}} of Domesday, and up until the time of Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Sheriff.|$|R
6000|$|... "Curious that {{it should}} have struck you like that," [...] he remarked. [...] "Do you know, when I was telling it <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> feeling.--Do you mind {{crouching}} down a little now? I am going to blow the whistle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{power to}} find water that way. Back in Illinois an old German {{used to do}} that to locate wells. He showed me <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> power. <b>I</b> can't explain. But you needn't look so dumfounded. There's nothing supernatural about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I was {{a little}} boy, Marian," [...] he said, gazing at her, [...] "I {{used to think that}} Paul Delaroche's Christian martyr was the most {{exquisite}} vision of beauty in the world. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> feeling as I look at you now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{friends at}} Tillietudlem judge too hastily and too ill of me," [...] {{answered}} Morton. [...] "I {{wish to have}} free exercise of my own religion, without insulting any other; and as to your family, I only desire an opportunity to show them <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> friendship and kindness as ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{chill of}} fear {{whenever}} I {{look at the}} beautiful spring, and at night as I awake to hear the soft babble of running water, I freeze until my heart feels like cold lead. Winds, I'm not a coward; but I can't help this feeling. Perhaps, it's only {{the memory of that}} awful night with Wetzel." ...|$|E
60|$|When he ceased {{speaking}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> impulse {{that must}} have governed Steele--somehow to show Sampson not so black as he was painted, {{to give him the}} benefit of a doubt, to arraign him justly in the eyes of Rangers who knew what wild border life was.|$|R
2500|$|A {{year later}} Putin commented on his response, [...] "I {{probably}} should have returned to Moscow, but nothing would <b>have</b> changed. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> level of communication both in Sochi and in Moscow, but from a PR point of view <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> demonstrated some special eagerness to return." ...|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli {{protease}} I is assayed as an esterase active {{with certain}} synthetic model chymotrypsin substrates. However, the gene encoding protease <b>I</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> DNA sequence and genomic location as tesA, {{a gene that}} encodes E. coli thioesterase I.

[Pencil and note-book in hand.] I feel {{bound to}} tell you that you are not down on my list of {{eligible}} young men, although <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> list as the dear Duchess of Bolton has. We work together, in fact. However, I am quite ready to enter your name, should your answers be what a really affectionate mother requires. Do you smoke? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> notion {{with respect}} to local names. Some at once prepossess us {{in favor of a}} place; others repel us, by unlucky {{associations}} of the mind; and I have known scenes worthy of being the very haunt of poetry and romance, yet doomed to irretrievable vulgarity, by some ill-chosen name, which not even the magic numbers of a Halleck or a Bryant could elevate into poetical acceptation.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{year ago}} I landed on this coast with one solitary dollar. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sum {{in my pocket}} to-day. I was second cook on a tramp fruiter; and they marooned me here early one morning, without benefit of clergy, just because I poulticed {{the face of the}} first mate with cheese omelette at dinner. The fellow had kicked because I'd put {{horseradish}} in it instead of cheese.|$|E
6000|$|All Clive's blood tingled at {{the idea}} that any man was going to marry Miss Newcome. He knew it before--a {{fortnight}} since, and it was nothing to him to hear it. He was glad that the growing darkness prevented his face from being seen. [...] "I am of the family, too," [...] said Clive, [...] "and Barnes Newcome and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> grandfather." ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl laughs. [...] "When little Egbert {{took hold}} of your sword, uncle, and asked you how many people you had killed, do you know <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{question}} in my mind; and I thought {{when you went to}} the Drawing-room, perhaps the King will knight him. But instead he knighted mamma's apothecary, Sir Danby Jilks: that horrid little man, and <b>I</b> won't <b>have</b> you knighted any more." ...|$|R
60|$|Two years did I {{live in this}} anxious condition, in all which time, {{contrary}} to my former resolutions, my head was filled with nothing but projects and deligns, how I might escape from this island; and so much were my wandering thoughts bent upon a rambling disposition that <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> boat that <b>I</b> went from Sallee in, <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> ventured once more to {{the uncertainty of the}} raging ocean.|$|R
60|$|Whatever, therefore, {{is destined}} to be {{employed}} reproductively, either in its existing shape, or indirectly by a previous (or even subsequent) exchange, is capital. Suppose that I have laid out all the money I possess in wages and tools, and that the article I produce is just completed: in the interval which elapses before I can sell the article, realize the proceeds, and lay them out again in wages and tools, will it be said that I have no capital? Certainly not: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> capital as before, perhaps a greater, but it is locked up, as the expression is, and not disposable.|$|E
6000|$|... "What an impertinent idiot {{that man}} is!" [...] remarked {{the other to}} his partner. [...] "His soul is in Downing Street; his neckcloth is foolscap; his hair is sand; his legs are rulers; his vitals are tape and sealing-wax; he was a prig in his cradle; and never laughed since he was born, except three times at the same joke of his chief. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> liking for that man, Miss Amory, I have for that cold boiled veal." [...] Upon which Blanche of course remarked, that Mr. Pendennis was wicked, mechant, {{perfectly}} abominable, and wondered {{what he would say}} when her back was turned.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do call {{things by}} their proper names," [...] {{interrupted}} Bickley. [...] "I told you yesterday {{that what you}} are suffering from is neuritis in your right arm, which will become chronic if you neglect it much longer. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing myself, so I ought to know, and unless I can stop operating for a while I believe my fingers will become useless. Also something is affecting my sight, overstrain, I suppose, so that I am obliged to wear stronger and stronger glasses. I think I shall have to leave Ogden" [...] (his partner) [...] "in charge for a while, and get away into the sun. There is none here before June." ...|$|E

60|$|This I {{did with}} respect to the other men whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made prisoners in <b>the</b> steerage, whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> design to be kind to as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to these; but upon whom I {{resolved}} to work this way, because, after all, <b>I</b> might <b>have</b> this work to do over again, if I should meet with any disappointment or miscarriage in the voyage; or especially, if we should be put to any difficulties or distresses in the pursuing it.|$|R

60|$|Tell Mamie that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sitting-room as we {{had when}} we came here with poor Arthur, and that my bedroom is the room out of it which she and Katie had. Surely it is the oddest town to read in! But it is taken on poor Arthur's {{principle}} that {{a place in the}} way pays the expenses of a through journey; and the people would seem to be coming up to the scratch gallantly. It was a dull Sunday, though; O it was a dull Sunday, without a book! For I had forgotten to buy one at Newcastle, until it was too late. So after dark I made a jug of whisky-punch, and drowned the unlucky Headland's remembrance of his failures.|$|E
60|$|What {{science can}} present greater attractions than philology? How can {{a lover of}} {{literary}} excellence fail to rejoice in the ancient masterpieces? And with what consistency could I, whose business lies {{so much in the}} attempt to decipher the past, and to build up intelligible forms out of the scattered fragments of long-extinct beings, fail to take a sympathetic, though an unlearned, interest in the labours of a Niebuhr, a Gibbon, or a Grote? Classical history is a great section of the palaeontology of man; and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> double respect for it as for other kinds of palaeontology--that is to say, a respect for the facts which it establishes as for all facts, and a still greater respect for it as a preparation for the discovery of a law of progress.|$|E
60|$|I am a {{very old}} man; how old I do not know. Possibly I am a hundred, {{possibly}} more; but I cannot tell because I have never aged as other men, nor do I remember any childhood. So far as I can recollect I {{have always been a}} man, a man of about thirty. I appear today as I did forty years and more ago, and yet I feel that I cannot go on living forever; that some day I shall die the real death from which there is no resurrection. I do not know why I should fear death, I who have died twice and am still alive; but yet <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> horror of it as you who have never died, and it is because of this terror of death, I believe, that I am so convinced of my mortality.|$|E
40|$|I {{would like}} to congratulate Dr. Possolo for his {{excellent}} [...] and very personal [...] exposition of the subject. I deeply enjoyed hearing his presentation in Leuven, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pleasure reading his contribution. I will first discuss his categorization into Marks, Maps and Shapes. I will then share some personal [...] obviously partial [...] views on three main challenges faced {{in the field of}} spatial statistics, that were not addressed in the paper.

5000|$|On March 21, 2011, Metal Hammer {{reported}} that Alice in Chains would begin recording their new album {{by the end}} of 2011. In May 2012, Cantrell revealed that, prior to the recording sessions, he had surgery. He explained, [...] "The thing that set me back is <b>I</b> <b>had</b> some bone spurs and cartilage issues in my shoulders. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> issue in <b>the</b> other shoulder about six years ago so I've had them both done now. It's a repetitive motion injury from playing." [...] In December 2012, Cantrell confirmed that the album was completed.|$|R
