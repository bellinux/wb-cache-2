The disease was initially known as <b>jaagsiekte,</b> a word derived from Afrikaans, meaning [...] "chasing sickness," [...] so called because animals are in respiratory distress {{as if they are}} out of breath from being chased.

50|$|On 14 February 2003, Dolly was euthanised {{because she}} had a {{progressive}} lung disease and severe arthritis. A Finn Dorset such as Dolly has a life expectancy of around 11 to 12 years, but Dolly lived 6.5 years. A post-mortem examination showed she had a form of lung cancer called ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma, also known as <b>Jaagsiekte,</b> which is a fairly common disease of sheep and is caused by the retrovirus JSRV. Roslin scientists stated that they did not think there was a connection with Dolly being a clone, and that other sheep in the same flock had died of the same disease. Such lung diseases are a particular danger for sheep kept indoors, and Dolly had to sleep inside for security reasons.|$|E

A panel of 249 human lung tumours, 21 nontumour lung lesions, four normal lung tissues, 23 adenocarcinomas from other organs and a cell line expressing a human endogenous retrovirus protein was examined immunohistochemically using a rabbit antiserum directed against the JSRV capsid protein.

40|$|The {{candidate}} {{tumor-suppressor gene}} hyaluronidase 2 (HYAL 2) encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell-surface protein {{that serves as}} an entry receptor for <b>jaagsiekte</b> sheep retrovirus, a virus that causes contagious lung cancer in sheep that is morphologically similar to human bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. The viral envelope (Env) protein alone can transform cultured cells, and we hypothesized that Env could bind and sequester the HYAL 2 receptor and thus liberate a potential oncogenic factor bound and negatively controlled by HYAL 2. Here we show that the HYAL 2 receptor protein {{is associated with the}} RON receptor tyrosine kinase (also called MST 1 R or Stk in the mouse), rendering it functionally silent. In human cells expressing a <b>jaagsiekte</b> sheep retrovirus Env transgene, the Env protein physically associates with HYAL 2. RON liberated from the association with HYAL 2 becomes functionally active and consequently activates the Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways leading to oncogenic transformation of immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells.

The affinities of the JSRV envelope glycoprotein for Hyal 2 and the Hyal 2 mutant were similar, and hyaluronan did not block either high-affinity interaction or virus infection. While generating the Hyal 2 mutant, we discovered that our previous analysis of the hyaluronidase activity of Hyal 2 was affected by a contaminating hyaluronan lyase, which we have identified as the occlusion-derived baculo-virus E 66 protein of the recombinant baculovirus used to produce Hyal 2.

However, a preliminary restriction enzyme analysis of the linear proviral DNA of this new lentivirus (SA-DMVV) revealed that it is significantly district from visna virus and CAEV and therefore may represent a third type of lentivirus. Antibodies to the virus were demonstrated in a number of sheep in various parts of the country, but a direct link to a disease condition was not found.

40|$|Ovine {{pulmonary}} adenocarcinoma is a contagious {{viral disease}} of sheep {{that results in}} pulmonary neoplasia in some animals. The economic impact can be significant: up to 80 % of the flock can be lost upon first exposure to the virus, with continuing losses that may {{be as high as}} 20 % each year in some flocks. Excluding this disease from a flock is difficult, in part because no diagnostic test can detect animals in the preclinical stage. No effective treatment or vaccine is available, and eradication is challenging. Currently, ovine pulmonary adenomatosis exists in most sheep-raising areas of the world, with the exception of New Zealand and Australia. Iceland is the only country to have successfully eradicated this disease. Etiology Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma results from infection by <b>jaagsiekte</b> sheep retrovirus (JSRV), which is also known as the pulmonary adenomatosis virus. This virus {{is a member of the}} genus Betaretrovirus in the Retroviridae. Species Affected Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma mainly affects domesticated sheep (Ovis aries). Sardinian moufflon (Ovis musimon, a species of wild sheep) can also become ill, and a few cases have been reported in domesticated goats. Geographic Distribution Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma can be found in sheep-raising countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. This disease does not occur in Australia or New Zealand. It has been eradicated from Iceland. Transmission Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma can be transmitted by the respiratory route, probably via aerosols or droplets. Infectious virus occurs in the respiratory exudates of infected sheep. <b>Jaagsiekte</b> sheep retrovirus can be found in tumors, lung fluids, peripheral blood leucocytes and lymphoid organs; before tumors develop, the virus is detected in lymphoreticular cells. Horizontal transmission has been demonstrated among sheep of all ages, but neonates seem to be particularly susceptible to infection. There is no evidence that in utero transmission is significant in the epidemiology of this disease; however, recent studies suggest that JSRV might be spread in milk or colostrum. <b>Jaagsiekte</b> sheep retrovirus does not survive for long periods in the environment...|$|E

40|$|Ovine {{pulmonary}} adenocarcinoma (OPA) is {{an infectious}} lung tumor of sheep caused by <b>Jaagsiekte</b> sheep retrovirus (JSRV). To test {{the hypothesis that}} JSRV insertional mutagenesis {{is involved in the}} oncogenesis of OPA, we cloned and characterized 70 independent integration sites from 23 cases of OPA. Multiple integration sites were identified in most tumors. BLAST analysis of the sequences did not disclose any potential oncogenic motifs or any identical integration sites in different tumors. Thirty-seven of the integration sites were mapped to individual chromosomes by PCR with a panel of sheep-hamster hybrid cell lines. Integration sites were found on 20 of the 28 sheep chromosomes, suggesting a random distribution. However, four integration sites from four different tumors mapped to chromosome 16. By Southern blot hybridization, probes derived from two of these sites mapped to within 5 kb of each other on normal sheep DNA. These sites were found within a single sheep bacterial artificial chromosome clone and were further mapped to only 2. 5 kb apart, within an unchar-acterized predicted gene and less than 200 kb from a mitogen-activated protein kinase-encoding gene. These findings suggest that {{there is at least one}} common integration site for JSRV in OPA and add weight to the hypothesis that insertional mutagenesis is involved in the development of this tumor. <b>Jaagsiekte</b> sheep retrovirus (JSRV) is the etiological agent of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA), a naturally occur...|$|E

40|$|<b>Jaagsiekte</b> sheep {{retrovirus}} (JSRV) is the etiological {{agent of}} a contagious lung tumour of sheep known as sheep pulmonary adenomatosis (syn: ovine pulmonary carcinoma, <b>jaagsiekte).</b> JSRV exhibits a simple genetic organization, {{characteristic of the}} type D and type B retroviruses, with the canonical retroviral sequences gag, pro, pol and env encoding the structural proteins of the virion. An additional open reading frame (orf-x), of approximately 500 bp overlapping pol, {{is present in the}} only two complete sequences of JSRV published to date. Since very little information is available on the biology of JSRV it is important to establish if orf-x is conserved between different virus isolates. In this study we analysed the orf-x region of JSRV isolates collected from the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and South Africa. In addition we also analysed the presence of orf-x in JSRV-related endogenous sequences (enJSRVs) present in the sheep genome. Orf-x was highly conserved in all the exogenous isolates (n= 10) and in most of the endogenous sequences (n= 8). Thus orf-x may be an accessory gene of JSRV and haves a biological function which might be advantageous to JSRV.
