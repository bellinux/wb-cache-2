5|$|From {{the trade}} {{overseas}} and over land, the Chinese acquired peaches from Samarkand, date palms, pistachios, and figs from Greater Iran, pine nuts and <b>ginseng</b> roots from Korea and mangoes from Southeast Asia. In China, {{there was a}} great demand for sugar; during the reign of Harsha over North India (r. 606–647), Indian envoys to the Tang brought two makers of sugar who successfully taught the Chinese how to cultivate sugarcane. Cotton also came from India as a finished product from Bengal, although it was during the Tang that the Chinese began to grow and process cotton, and by the Yuan dynasty it became the prime textile fabric in China.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Lum Chang Holdings {{sold the}} {{building}} at a price of S$25 million to Yu Kwok Chun, who {{was the head of}} a Hong Kong-based multinational corporation with its flagship department store, Yue Hwa Chinese Products Emporium. The company, set up by Yu's father in 1959, is a global corporation of 35 companies involved in investments, travel and general trading. Yue Hwa's three department stores in Hong Kong are popular with both Hong Kongers and tourists. Besides agricultural produce from various provinces of China, the stores also sell jade carvings, handicrafts, antiques and medical products such as <b>ginseng,</b> antlers and cordyceps.|$|E
5|$|The UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage {{took place}} in 2003 and South Korea joined the program a year later. In 2005 China {{declared}} some 1200 properties as intangible cultural heritage, with 16 items belonging to the Korean minority of the country, including the traditional wedding ceremony, Arirang (a folk song) and nolttwigi (a traditional seesaw game). The CHA decided that they also had to broaden the scope of intangible heritage to properties {{that do not have}} any designated 'holders', like kimchi, hangul or Goryeo <b>ginseng.</b>|$|E
5|$|Warfarin also {{interacts with}} many herbs and spices, some used in food (such as ginger and garlic) and others used purely for {{medicinal}} purposes (such as <b>ginseng</b> and Ginkgo biloba). All may increase bleeding and bruising in people taking warfarin; similar effects {{have been reported}} with borage (starflower) oil or fish oils. St. John's Wort, sometimes recommended to help with mild to moderate depression, reduces {{the effectiveness of a}} given dose of warfarin; it induces the enzymes that break down warfarin in the body, causing a reduced anticoagulant effect.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the largest}} souks is Souk Semmarine, which sells {{everything}} from brightly coloured bejewelled sandals and slippers and leather pouffes to jewellery and kaftans. Souk Ableuh contains stalls which specialize in lemons, chilis, capers, pickles, green, red, and black olives, and mint, a common ingredient of Moroccan cuisine and tea. Similarly, Souk Kchacha specializes in dried fruit and nuts, including dates, figs, walnuts, cashews and apricots. Rahba Qedima contains stalls selling hand-woven baskets, natural perfumes, knitted hats, scarves, tee shirts, Ramadan tea, <b>ginseng,</b> and alligator and iguana skins. Criee Berbiere, to the northeast of this market, is noted for its dark Berber carpets and rugs. Souk Siyyaghin {{is known for its}} jewellery, and Souk Smata nearby is noted for its extensive collection of babouches and belts. Souk Cherratine specializes in leatherware, and Souk Belaarif sells modern consumer goods. Souk Haddadine specializes in ironware and lanterns.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>ginseng</b> (人参) is {{well over}} 2,000 {{years old in}} Chinese medicine. <b>Ginseng</b> {{contains}} ginsenosides. The amount of ginsenosides in <b>ginseng</b> depends on how the plant was cultivated {{and the age of}} the root. Wild <b>ginseng</b> is rare and commands the highest prices on the market. Red Panax <b>ginseng</b> is the most popular form of <b>ginseng</b> and it is usually packaged as a liquid or tea. <b>Ginseng</b> comes in two kinds, red and white. The color of the <b>ginseng</b> depends on how it is processed. White <b>ginseng</b> is unprocessed and dries naturally. Red <b>ginseng</b> is processed with steam and is believed to be more effective. Native Americans have used American <b>ginseng</b> for dry coughs, constipation, and fevers.|$|E
25|$|Besides P.ginseng, {{many other}} plants are {{also known as}} or mistaken for the <b>ginseng</b> root. The most {{commonly}} known examples are American <b>ginseng</b> xiyangshen (P.quinquefolius); Japanese <b>ginseng</b> (P.japonicus); Prince <b>ginseng</b> (Pseudostellaria heterophylla); and Siberian <b>ginseng</b> (Eleutherococcus senticosus). True <b>ginseng</b> plants belong only to the Panax genus.|$|E
25|$|Siberian <b>ginseng</b> is in {{the same}} family, but not genus, as true <b>ginseng.</b> The active {{compounds}} in Siberian <b>ginseng</b> are eleutherosides, not ginsenosides. Instead of a fleshy root, Siberian <b>ginseng</b> has a woody root.|$|E
25|$|Asian <b>ginseng</b> (Panax <b>ginseng)</b> is {{available}} commercially as fresh, red, and white ginsengs; wild <b>ginseng</b> is used where available.|$|E
25|$|Woods-grown American <b>ginseng</b> {{programs}} in Vermont, Maine, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, Colorado, West Virginia, and Kentucky, have been encouraging the planting of <b>ginseng</b> both to restore natural habitats and to remove pressure from any remaining wild <b>ginseng.</b>|$|E
25|$|Concerns exist when <b>ginseng</b> is used chronically, {{potentially}} causing {{side effects}} such as headaches, insomnia, and digestive problems. The risk of interactions between <b>ginseng</b> and prescribed medications {{is believed to}} be low, but <b>ginseng</b> may have adverse effects when used with the blood thinner, warfarin. <b>Ginseng</b> has been shown to have adverse drug reactions with phenelzine. A potential interaction has also been reported with imatinib, resulting in hepatotoxicity, and with lamotrigine.|$|E
25|$|Control over <b>ginseng</b> {{fields in}} China and Korea {{became an issue}} in the 16th century. By the 1900s, due to the demand for <b>ginseng</b> having outstripped the {{available}} wild supply, Korea began the commercial cultivation of <b>ginseng</b> which continues to this day.|$|E
25|$|Since American <b>ginseng</b> was {{originally}} imported into China via a subtropical seaport, Chinese doctors believed American <b>ginseng</b> must {{be good for}} yang, because {{it came from a}} hot area. They did not know, however, that American <b>ginseng</b> can only grow in temperate regions. Nonetheless, the root is legitimately classified as more yin because it generates fluids.|$|E
25|$|White <b>ginseng</b> {{is fresh}} <b>ginseng</b> {{which has been}} dried without being heated. It is peeled and dried to reduce the water content to 12% or less. White <b>ginseng</b> {{air-dried}} in the sun may contain less of the therapeutic constituents. Enzymes contained in the root may break down these constituents {{in the process of}} drying. Drying in the sun bleaches the root to a yellowish-white color.|$|E
25|$|Wild <b>ginseng</b> grows {{naturally}} and is {{harvested from}} {{wherever it is}} found. It is relatively rare, and even increasingly endangered, {{due in large part}} to high demand for the product in recent years, which has led to the wild plants being sought out and harvested faster than new ones can grow (roots require years to reach maturity). Wild <b>ginseng</b> can be either Asian or American, and can be processed to be red or white <b>ginseng.</b>|$|E
25|$|Collecting American <b>ginseng</b> {{to assist}} the Asian {{traditional}} medicine trade has made <b>ginseng</b> the most harvested wild plant in North America {{for the last two}} centuries, which eventually led to a listing on CITES Appendix II.|$|E
25|$|TCM Information: Species: Panax <b>ginseng.</b> Pinyin: Ren Shen. Common Name: Chinese <b>Ginseng.</b> Quality: Sweet, Bitter, Warm. Meridians: Lung, Spleen, Heart. Actions: Tonifies yuan qi {{to treat}} {{collapse}} of qi, tonifies spleen and lung, generates fluids, mildly tonifies heart qi.|$|E
25|$|Asian (Korean) <b>ginseng</b> is commercially {{grown in}} Germany.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{recognition}} of the plant outside of China originated from research in sugar substitutes. In the 1970s, while analyzing the sweet component of the jiaogulan plant (known as amachazuru in Japan), Masahiro Nagai discovered chemical compounds identical {{to some of those}} found in Panax <b>ginseng,</b> an unrelated plant. Afterward, Tsunematsu Takemoto reported that jiaogulan contains four saponins identical to those in Panax <b>ginseng</b> as well as seventeen other similar saponins. Over the next decade 82 saponins (gypenosides) were identified in jiaogulan, compared to the 28 (ginsenosides) found in Panax <b>ginseng.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fresh <b>ginseng</b> is the raw product. Its use {{is limited}} by availability.|$|E
25|$|Commercial <b>ginseng</b> {{is sold in}} over 35 countries. China has {{historically}} been the plant's largest consumer.|$|E
25|$|Originally, American <b>ginseng</b> was {{imported}} into China via subtropical Guangzhou, the seaport next to Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ginseng</b> may be {{included}} in energy drinks or herbal teas (in small amounts) or sold as a dietary supplement.|$|E
25|$|Most American <b>ginseng</b> is {{produced}} in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and British Columbia and the American state of Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ginseng</b> {{generally}} {{has a good}} safety profile and the incidence of adverse effects seems to be low when used over the short term.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>ginseng</b> {{has been}} used in Chinese {{traditional}} medicine over centuries, there is little evidence from clinical research that it has any effects on health.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>ginseng</b> {{has been}} used in {{traditional}} medicine for centuries, modern research is inconclusive about its biological effects. Preliminary clinical research indicates possible effects on memory, fatigue, menopause symptoms, and insulin response in people with mild diabetes. Out of forty-four studies examined between 2005-2015, twenty-nine showed positive, limited evidence, and fifteen showed no effects. As of 2017, there is insufficient evidence to indicate that <b>ginseng</b> has any health effects. Ginsenosides, unique phytochemicals of the Panax species, are being studied for their potential biological properties.|$|E
25|$|Interactions with {{ketorolac}} exist {{with some}} herbal supplements. Panax <b>ginseng,</b> clove, ginger, arnica, feverfew, dong quai, chamomile, and Ginkgo biloba, {{increases the risk}} of bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Since the 18th century, American <b>ginseng</b> (P. quinquefolius) {{has been}} {{primarily}} exported to Asia, {{where it is}} highly valued for its perceived superior quality and sweeter taste.|$|E
25|$|In September 2014, Bobo's partial {{remains were}} found by <b>ginseng</b> hunters in {{a wooded area}} of {{northern}} Decatur County, Tennessee just off of I-40, nearly 20 miles (32km) from Darden.|$|E
25|$|The {{items that}} the {{candidates}} needed to buy were: a diamond, champagne, $100, a bowler hat, a Freeview box, a dental check-up, a mattress, pie & mash, some <b>ginseng</b> {{and a bowl}} of jellied eels.|$|E
25|$|Species: Elutherococcus senticosus. Pinyin: Ci Wu Jia. Common Name: Siberian <b>Ginseng.</b> Quality: Pungent (Acrid), Slightly bitter, Warm. Meridians: Spleen, Heart, Kidney. Actions: Tonifies spleen and kidney, mildly tonifies heart qi, {{promotes}} blood circulation, calms shen.|$|E
25|$|Species: Panax quinquefolius. Pinyin: Xi Yang Shen. Common Name: American <b>Ginseng.</b> Quality: Sweet, Slightly bitter, Cold. Meridians: Heart, Kidney, Lung. Actions: Tonifies {{lung and}} spleen qi, tonifies lung yin, cools fire from lung yin deficiency, generates fluids.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{side effects}} include {{increased}} risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, heart palpitations, and restlessness. Ginkgo should be used with caution when combined with other herbs known to increase bleeding (e.g. garlic, <b>ginseng,</b> ginger).|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{nearly all}} of the world's 80,000 tons of <b>ginseng</b> in {{international}} commerce was produced in four countries: China, South Korea, Canada, and the United States. In 2013, sales exceeded $2 billion, of which half came from South Korea in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{of gross}} {{overdose}} with P. <b>ginseng</b> may include nausea, vomiting, irritability, restlessness, urinary and bowel incontinence, fever, increased blood pressure, increased respiration, decreased sensitivity and reaction to light, decreased heart rate, cyanotic (blue) facial complexion, red facial complexion, seizures, convulsions, and delirium.|$|E
