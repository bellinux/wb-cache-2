JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with the dents {{on the side of}} it and just getting in touch with my roots: Who I am; where I came from. I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow."

[...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover. JoJo states [...] "it became about my family. As much as I can see in the world, there's nothing more important to me than that foundation of family, friendship and real love." ...|$|E

In 1983, she {{took part in the}} West German public selection of the national entry for the Eurovision Song Contest. Her title Infinitely far reached the eleventh and therefore penultimate place.

[...] "The key difference in the match then was that in the final set Roger's level fell and Rafa was able to maintain his level," [...] he said. Rafael Nadal felt that surviving the third set and winning it in a tiebreaker was the pivotal point of the match. [...] "Winning the third was vital. It would have gotten very complicated if I had lost that set." [...] Regarding Federer's breakdown during the trophy presentation, Nadal said he understood what Federer was feeling. [...] "Of course it can happen to all of us. It was an emotional moment, and I think this also lifts up sport, to see a great champion like Federer expressing his emotions. It shows his human side.

50|$|Combined with accuracy, realism is a {{collection}} of factors that make the simulation seem realistic and lifelike. Factors such as the graphical realism of the course, 3D motion graphics, sound and visual effects such as the sound of the ball when it strikes the green or splashes into a lake make the game that much more realistic and lifelike. New developments such as auto ball feed and changes in the slope of the hitting area now allow the golfer to experience the feeling of playing the ball where it lies, no matter where it lies. This creates the <b>feeling</b> of thinking <b>like</b> <b>you</b> are on a golf course, rather than playing on a golf simulator - it is the feeling of planning your next golf shot, and not your next simulator command.|$|R
40|$|Illness. A secret. Feeling alone? Have {{you ever}} kept a secret? A life-changing secret {{that keeps you}} secluded, isolated, and {{contained}} in a bubble, lonely and empty? The daily struggle of coping with your own secret, yet <b>feeling</b> <b>like</b> everyone <b>you</b> {{come in contact with}} already knows, takes its toll in the lives of those who carry the burden of a chronic disease. While dealing with judgmental thoughts, and the scrutinizing gaze from others, do we think that the stigma of a medical diagnosis affects our ability to love someone? More specifically, how about being capable of allowing someone to love you knowing that you are HIV positive? In We Were Here, the choreographic research speaks directly to the topic of secrecy and isolation through song, dance, poetry, and videography of people living with life-threatening diseases in today’s society. This piece will take the audience on a short journey through the lives of seven individuals who seek to find peace and understanding in revealing their conditions to their family, friends and loved ones. In seven different journeys, through the highs and lows of coping with a chronic disease, the silver lining of WE WERE HERE, provides a friendly reminder that everyone needs somebody, sometimes...|$|R
5000|$|The All Blacks manager {{during the}} 1995 World Cup, Colin Meads, has blamed {{what he called}} [...] "dodgy milk", which he and some others of the All Blacks drank after a Wednesday night {{gathering}} prior to preparing for the match.

We didn't want South Africa knowing that we were crook. And that is one that I regret. We should have let people know." [...] Meads partly kept the food poisoning situation secret to not give the Springboks an advantage before the game, but apparently continued to do so for a long while afterward to {{not appear to be a}} bad sport in losing by making excuses. Meads went on to say that [...] "I reckon that is what did us, it was in the milk. That is my theory. But no one else believes me." [...] When asked for his thoughts on intentional poisoning and the Suzie theory, Meads rather abruptly and completely discounted it, saying [...] "Well, you just don't know.

A Pakistani girl, Zaara Hayat Khan's (Preity Zinta) chance meeting with an Indian Air Force officer Veer Pratap Singh (Shah Rukh Khan) develops into a tale of ardour that has the grand passion of a modern-day Laila-Majnu. The film works because the stars shine. Preity's Zaara is both restrained and dignified. This is her most nuanced performance to date. And Aditya Chopra's wonderful screenplay etches out even the smaller parts in loving detail. Divya Dutta's Shabbo, Zaara's playmate, is as memorable as Mughal-e-Azam's Suraiyya (the character, not the heroine.)...In all, we have an honest-to-the-heart film that remarkably bypasses the bitterness of Indo-Pak relations in a cross-border love story and reaches out as much to the McDonald-multiplex couple as the babuji-bahenji pair. Veer-Zaara is for all seasons and every reason." ...|$|E
