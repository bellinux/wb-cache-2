500|$|Just Good Old Rock and Roll is {{much more}} {{straightforward}} than past works, consisting of funk-influenced hard rock, although [...] "So Many People to Tell" [...] and [...] "Silver Passion Mine" [...] also exhibit a late-psychedelic sound. As Whetstone explains, [...] "We were fairly naive in terms of guidance; we had none, so we were experimenting {{with a lot of}} musical styles. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> album, you'll hear a lot of diversity, feel and tempo changes...That was our learning curve." [...] In early 1970, Whetstone and Wade departed the band and moved to Canada where they formed Stallion Thumbrock. Morgan and Kincaid constructed another line-up of The Electric Prunes that included Michael Kearns, Clay Groomer, Huey Plumeigh, and Galen Pugh; however, by mid-1970 the band dissolved.|$|E
500|$|In the band, Joseph {{covered a}} lot of the {{keyboard}} parts that Yanni could not for lack of hands in the shows. He assisted with the task of managing the 30 or more synthesizers onstage, and helped layer with the orchestra to create a [...] "full-bodied, live-effect sound". [...] He did have to adjust some parts that did not work well in a live situation and worked extensively on programming sounds for all keyboardists. [...] Joseph said that [...] "Yanni gave us musicians a great deal of freedom to expand the music as well. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original recordings he did and what we ended up with in our live recordings, you can really hear the musician's input." [...] He readily credits Yanni's role in his professional development, and for five years of irreplaceable experiences and memories.|$|E

500|$|... "Monster" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga, RedOne and Space Cowboy, with RedOne {{producing}} the track. The song was recorded at the Record Plant Studio in Los Angeles. In an interview with MTV News, Gaga said that [...] "Monster" [...] describes her fear of sex and relationships and the literal meaning is about a [...] "guy with a big dick". She elaborated, [...] "It's the fear of attachment {{and the fear of}} loving something that's bad for you... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lyrics, it's like being in love with the bad boy all the time, and you keep going back for more." [...] Gaga added that the fear in [...] "Monster" [...] erupted from her need to have a stable relationship. [...] "I keep falling in love with the monster... But what I really need is the security and the safety and the womanhood, responsibility of my femininity. And so that's what that song is about.|$|E
500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called [...] "Alive" [...] the [...] "biggest surprise" [...] of J to tha L–O! The Remixes. William Ruhlmann of Allmusic {{gave the}} song a {{negative}} review, writing that her vocal limitations [...] "come {{to the fore}} when she is spotlighted on such a song without a dance arrangement to support her". He stated, however, that her vocal limitations are not [...] "as big a deal" [...] as her lack of emotional involvement: [...] "Though she tries to fake it here and there, she still sounds like she's singing her grocery list instead of the song's clichéd lyrics". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "syrupy ballad" [...] that is [...] "neither alive nor a remix". He stated that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> song long enough, [...] "you may actually be conned into thinking Lopez's voice and songs are passable". He concluded by stating {{as a result of}} [...] "Alive", J to tha L–O! The Remixes may be the most insidious album ever made.|$|E
500|$|... "Get On Top", a song which {{contains}} significant {{use of a}} wah pedal, was formed after a jam session conducted shortly after Frusciante had listened to Public Enemy: [...] "I came up with [...] {{on the way to}} rehearsal—just tapping it out with my foot." [...] The understated guitar solo played {{in the middle of the}} song was originally intended to be more noticeable, according to Frusciante, who was playing screaming guitar solos. He changed his thought process after listening to Steve Howe's guitar solo on Yes' [...] "Siberian Khatru": [...] "the band sounded really big—and they're playing really fast—and then this clean guitar solo comes out over on top. It's really beautiful, like it's on its own sort of shelf. For 'Get On Top' I wanted to play something that contrasted between the solo and the background." [...] "Savior", a song found towards the end of the album, features heavy effects, most notably an Electro-Harmonix Micro Synth with 16-second delay. Frusciante notes that the sound is [...] "directly inspired by Eric Clapton's playing in Cream. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> actual notes, they're like a Clapton solo—they just don't sound like it because of the effects." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 3, 2011, Against Me! {{announced}} that they started their own record label, Total Treble Music. [...] In November 2011, the band started working on [...] "new material" [...] for the next album. It {{turned out to be}} a false start, they scrapped it and went on tour. They started recording the album again in February 2012 at Total Treble Studio, with Grace taking complete creative control, acting as both recording engineer and record producer for the album. In May 2012, Grace publicly came out as transgender. Bowman recalled that [...] "he wasn't really surprised" [...] when Grace came out, because when he thought about it, [...] "the signs had always been there, especially <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lyrics". In June 2012, Bowman threw the first pitch at a Ray's baseball game. Weinberg left the band in December 2012. [...] He was eventually replaced by Atom Willard. Seward left the band in 2013, he was replaced by Inge Johansson.|$|E
2500|$|I {{produced}} the Black Crowes, and Jimmy joined {{them for a}} run of live dates in 1999. I saw the show in New York, and then I went to California and recorded the shows, took the tapes away, and fixed them up a little and mixed them. I did Live at the Greek without any input from anyone, as it wasn't originally {{going to be an}} official release. But I think everyone was impressed with it; certainly Jimmy said he was. Then, when Jimmy decided to do a new [...] DVD, he started looking for someone familiar with the modern applications necessary for surround sound mixing. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Royal Albert Hall [...] opening in 5.1, you can see Jimmy had this audio concept really early on of giving people a sense of the band going onstage and the audience swells around you. We had a meeting to discuss the requirements needed for the DVD project audio, and afterward, he asked if I would be interested in ‘helping’ him.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, Gainsbourg and English actress Jane Birkin began a {{relationship}} {{when they met}} {{on the set of}} the film Slogan. After filming, he asked her to record the song with him. Birkin had heard the Bardot version and thought it [...] "so hot". She said: [...] "I only sang it because I didn't want anybody else to sing it", jealous at the thought of his sharing a recording studio with someone else. Gainsbourg asked her to sing an octave higher than Bardot, [...] "so you'll sound like a little boy". It was recorded in an arrangement by Arthur Greenslade in a studio at Marble Arch. Birkin said she [...] "got a bit carried away with the heavy breathing – so much so, in fact, that I was told to calm down, which meant that at one point I stopped breathing altogether. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> record now, you can still hear that little gap." [...] There was media speculation, as with the Bardot version, that they had recorded live sex, to which Gainsbourg told Birkin, [...] "Thank goodness it wasn't, otherwise I hope {{it would have been a}} long-playing record." [...] It was released in February 1969. The single had a plain cover, with the words [...] "Interdit aux moins de 21 ans" [...] (forbidden to those under 21), and the record company changed the label from Philips to Fontana.|$|E

6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> men {{talking in}} a Pullman car, or an hotel corridor, or, better still, at the little tables in a {{first-class}} bar, you will not listen long before you hear one say: [...] "Well, we got out early, just after sunrise, right on the shoal." [...] And presently, even if you can't hear him, you will see him reach out his two hands and hold them about two feet apart for the other man to admire. He is measuring the fish. No, not the fish they caught; this was the big one that they lost. But they had him {{right up to the}} top of the water. Oh, yes, he was {{up to the top of}} the water all right. The number of huge fish that have been heaved up to the top of the water in our lakes is almost incredible. Or at least it used to be when we still had bar rooms and little tables for serving that vile stuff Scotch whisky and such foul things as gin Rickeys and John Collinses. It makes one sick to think of it, doesn't it? But there was good fishing in the bars, all the winter.|$|E

60|$|The other {{head under}} which I class our passions, {{is that of}} society, which may {{be divided into two}} sorts. 1. The society of the sexes, which answers the purpose of propagation; and next, that more general society, which we have with men and with other animals, and which we may in some sort be said to have even with the inanimate world. The passions {{belonging}} to the preservation of the individual turn wholly on pain and danger: those which belong to generation have their origin in gratifications and pleasures; the pleasure most directly belonging to this purpose is of a lively character, rapturous and violent, and confessedly the highest pleasure of sense; yet the absence of this so great an enjoyment scarce amounts to an uneasiness; and, except at particular times, I do not think it affects at all. When men describe in what manner they are affected by pain and danger, they do not dwell on the pleasure of health and the comfort of security, and then lament the loss of these satisfactions: the whole turns upon the actual pains and horrors which they endure. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> complaints of a forsaken lover, you observe that he insists largely on the pleasures which he enjoyed, or hoped to enjoy, and on the perfection of the object of his desires; it is the loss which is always uppermost in his mind. The violent effects produced by love, which has sometimes been even wrought up to madness, is no objection to the rule which we seek to establish. When men have suffered their imaginations to be long affected with any idea, it so wholly engrosses them as to shut out by degrees almost every other, and to break down every partition of the mind which would confine it. Any idea is sufficient for the purpose, as is evident from the infinite variety of causes, which give rise to madness: but this at most can only prove, that the passion of love is capable of producing very extraordinary effects, not that its extraordinary emotions have any connection with positive pain.|$|E

2500|$|They were voted No.52 on VH1's [...] "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock". [...] The band is {{credited}} for inventing the alternative metal genre {{which began in}} the 1980s and that fuses metal with other genres, including alternative rock. Tim Grierson of About.com said the band [...] "helped put alternative metal on the map." [...] Faith No More has also been credited for influencing nu metal bands, such as Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Sevendust, primarily due to the popularity of [...] "Epic", and other early material that featured rap and rock crossovers. Papa Roach vocalist Jacoby Shaddix, a self-confessed fan of the band, stated in a 2015 interview [...] "They fused some of that hip-hop and rock together. They were one of the earliest bands to do that, and definitely pioneers to a whole genre. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> Korn, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> how the bass and the drums lock up, it's quite similar to how Faith No More was doing it in their early years." ...|$|R
