5|$|The {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} is {{the amount}} of light and other forms of radiant energy it radiates per unit of time. It has units of power. The luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their <b>entire</b> <b>surface.</b> The rapidly rotating star Vega, for example, has a higher energy flux (power per unit area) at its poles than along its equator.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a Calabi–Yau manifold is a two-dimensional torus or donut shape. Consider a circle on this surface that goes once through the hole of the donut. An example is the red circle in the figure. There are infinitely many circles like it on a torus; in fact, the <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> is a union of such circles.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial species {{differ in}} the number and {{arrangement}} of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (monotrichous), a flagellum at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over the <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> of the cell (peritrichous). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power. This motor drives {{the motion of the}} filament, which acts as a propeller.|$|E
40|$|The TatABC {{subunits}} of the twin-arginine translocation machinery allow {{transport of}} folded proteins {{by an unknown}} mechanism. Here we show that the <b>entire</b> <b>surfaces</b> of folded Tat substrates contact TatB via both of its predicted helices. Our data suggest that TatB forms an oligomeric binding site that transiently accommodates folded Tat precursors...|$|R

5|$|One {{explanation}} is {{the exposure of}} whiter subsurface layers by impacts; another is that the scattered objects' greater distance from the Sun creates a composition gradient, analogous to the composition gradient of the terrestrial and gas giant planets. Mike Brown, discoverer of the scattered object Eris, suggests that its paler colour could be because, at its current distance from the Sun, its atmosphere of methane is frozen over its <b>entire</b> <b>surface,</b> creating an inches-thick layer of bright white ice. Pluto, conversely, being closer to the Sun, would be warm enough that methane would freeze only onto cooler, high-albedo regions, leaving low-albedo tholin-covered regions bare of ice.|$|E
5|$|The {{emission}} {{of dust and}} particles could have covered the <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would {{have led to a}} sudden greenhouse effect. Over a longer period, sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the Earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al. (2001) suggests that net primary productivity (NPP) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E
5|$|After the war the {{greyhound}} company introduced floodlights and in 1958 the <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> required relaying {{after the}} Commonwealth Games had finished. In 1971 the Welsh Greyhound Derby was given 'classic' status. In 1977 the Cardiff City Council {{announced that a}} revamp of the Arms Park site would not include greyhound racing. The Welsh Rugby Union required the Arms Park track to extend terracing at the National Stadium. The last Welsh Greyhound Derby was on 9 July and the last meeting was held on 30 July. 1,128 greyhound fans saw Lillyput Queen, owned by Cardiff butcher Malcolm Davies and trained by Freddie Goodman, win the last race. Cardiff City Council had taken less than ten minutes to reject a plan to switch greyhound racing to nearby Maindy Stadium.|$|E

5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.|$|E

Mucous glands cover the <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> area of the amphibian body and specialize in keeping the body lubricated. There are many other functions of the mucous glands such as controlling the pH, thermoregulation, adhesive properties to the environment, anti-predator behaviors (slimy to the grasp), chemical communication, even anti-bacterial/viral properties for protection against pathogens.|$|E
25|$|Inter-crater plains are {{the oldest}} visible surface, predating the heavily cratered terrain. They are gently rolling or hilly and {{occur in the}} regions between larger craters. The inter-crater plains appear to have obliterated many earlier craters, and show a general paucity of smaller craters below about 30km in diameter. It {{is not clear whether}} they are of {{volcanic}} or impact origin. The inter-crater plains are distributed roughly uniformly over the <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> of the planet.|$|E

25|$|The {{geological}} {{formation of the}} state is greatly varied, with the Michigan Basin being the most major formation. Primary boulders are found over the <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> of the Upper Peninsula (being principally of primitive origin), while Secondary deposits cover the entire Lower Peninsula. The Upper Peninsula exhibits Lower Silurian sandstones, limestones, copper and iron bearing rocks, corresponding to the Huronian system of Canada. The central portion of the Lower Peninsula contains coal measures and rocks of the Pennsylvanian period. Devonian and sub-Carboniferous deposits are scattered over the entire state.|$|E
25|$|The beaker came {{in various}} sizes from 8 to 50cm high and from 5 to 20cm in diameter. Decoration filled the <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> with {{horizontal}} bands of fingertip or fingernail impressions. It {{must have been}} in the decoration phase that grains of wheat and barley left their impression in the clay. Late in the period technique and decoration became slightly more varied and sophisticated: the walls were thinner and different motifs were used in the impressions: chevrons, cord marks, and punctures made with animal bones. Handles are sometimes added and the rims may turn in instead of out.|$|E
25|$|The optics to {{distribute}} {{the light in the}} desired pattern are designed into the reflector itself, rather than into the lens. Depending on the development tools and techniques in use, the reflector may be engineered from the start as a bespoke shape, or it may start as a parabola standing in for {{the size and shape of}} the completed package. In the latter case, the <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> area is modified so as to produce individual segments of specifically calculated, complex contours. The shape of each segment is designed such that their cumulative effect produces the required light distribution pattern.|$|E
50|$|Exterior {{corrosion}} resistance in a heat exchanger {{is especially important}} in coastal areas, humid areas, polluted areas, and in mining operations. Corrosion mechanisms of copper and aluminium alloys are different. CuproBraze tube contains 85% copper which provides high resistance against dezincification and stress corrosion cracking. The copper alloys tend to corrode uniformly over <b>entire</b> <b>surfaces</b> at known rates. This predictability of copper corrosion is important for proper maintenance management. Aluminium, on the other hand, {{is more likely to}} corrode locally by pitting, resulting eventually in holes.|$|R
