Groups that screening is recommended for include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following: people from areas of the world where hepatitis B occurs in more than 2%, those with HIV, intravenous drug users, men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> and those who live with someone with hepatitis B.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in women who {{reported}} <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both <b>men</b> and women and women who reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a <b>man</b> in the 3 months before and having at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during {{the year before the}} study. Of these women, 38 % who reported ever <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a woman were compared with those who reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> only. RESULTS: Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both <b>men</b> and women were more likely than women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a <b>sex</b> partner who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both <b>men</b> and women had a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both <b>men</b> and women were more likely than women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> only to engage in multiple risk behaviors. Health workers should be aware of bisexual experience among women, since this may be a marker for multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STDs...|$|R

2500|$|Acquired immune {{deficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) is {{a disease}} of the human immune system caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV can infect anybody, regardless of sex, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Worldwide, an estimated 5–10% of HIV infections {{are the result of}} <b>men</b> <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men.</b> However, in many developed countries, more HIV infections are transmitted by <b>men</b> <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> than by any other transmission route. In the United States, [...] "men who <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> since 1977 <b>have</b> an HIV prevalence (the total number of cases of a disease that are present in a population at a specific point in time) 60 times higher than the general population".|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protozoa}} can cause gastroenteritis – most commonly Giardia lamblia – but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., {{and other species}} have also been implicated. As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this etiologic agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> and following disasters.|$|E
5|$|Antiretroviral {{treatment}} {{among people}} with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP). TASP {{is associated with a}} 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa.

5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, {{with the possible exception}} of syphilis.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{prostitution}} and drug use, homosexuality {{has never been}} banned in China, but it was listed as a psychiatric disorder until 2001, and public acts of homosexual sex are punishable as hooliganism. Although increasingly tolerated in the cities, in general, homosexuality is highly stigmatised and men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> are under considerable pressure to conceal their sexual orientation. As a result, most homosexuals are married, or {{will be in the}} future, and form a bridge between the high-risk men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> group to their low-risk wives and other partners. The government has initiated few interventions for men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> leaving such programmes to advocacy groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and researchers. However, the government recently estimated that there were 5–10 million men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> living in China, of whom 1.35% are thought to be HIV positive. This information, in addition to studies indicating low levels of HIV knowledge, perceived risk, and testing, and high rates of sexually transmitted diseases, has prompted the Ministry of Health to now include men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> in the high-risk groups and to call for the development of novel interventions to target them.|$|E

40|$|Sex {{between people}} of the same gender occurs in all societies. In Africa such {{behavior}} is most often not associated with a homosexual identity, but <b>men</b> <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> usually <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women as well, get married, and have children. In most countries of Africa sex between {{people of the}} same gender is still prohibited under sodomy laws which were introduced by the colonial powers. Great stigma and discrimination occurs against {{those people who are}} either unable or unwilling {{to hide the fact that}} they <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> partners of the same sex. The adverse consequences documented in this paper include eviction from families and neighborhood, loss of jobs and housing, discrimination in the health services, and a high level of violence, including from the police.

40|$|The HIV- 1 clade C is {{prevalent}} {{worldwide and}} spread from Africa to South East Asia and South America {{early in the}} course of the epidemic. As a consequence of migration waves about 13 % of the Italian HIV- 1 epidemic is sustained by this clade. Two hundred fifty-four C pol sequences from the Italian ARCA database collected during 1997 - 2011 were analyzed. Epidemiological networks and geographical fluxes were identified through phylogeny using Bayesian approaches. Patients' country of origin was Italy, Africa, South America, and South East Asia for 44. 9 %, 23. 6 %, 4. 7 %, and 1. 6 %, respectively. Heterosexuals and <b>men</b> <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> accounted for 83. 2 % and 16. 8 %, respectively. Modality of infection was distributed differently: heterosexuals were largely prevalent among Italians (84. 1 %) and Africans (95. 3 %), while <b>men</b> <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> predominated among South Americans (66. 7 %). Eight significant clusters encompassing 111 patients (43. 7 %) were identified. Comparison between clustering and non-clustering patients indicated significant differences in country of origin, modality of infection and gender. Men <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> were associated to a higher probability to be included in networks (70 % for <b>men</b> <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> vs. 30. 3 % for heterosexuals). Phylogeography highlighted two significant groups. One contained Indian strains and the second encompassed South Americans and almost all Italian strains. Phylogeography indicated that the spread of C subtype among Italians is related to South American variant. Although Italian patients mainly reported themselves as heterosexuals, homo-bisexual contacts were likely their source of infection.
