She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything <b>else</b> <b>going</b> on.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} {{to believe that}} the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development in humans. One meta-analysis showed a moderate to strong correlation (r = 0.43) between performance on theory of mind and language tasks. One might argue that this relationship is due solely to the fact that both language and theory of mind seem to begin to develop substantially around the same time in children (between ages 2–5). However, many other abilities develop during this same time period as well, and do not produce such high correlations with one another nor with theory of mind. There must be something <b>else</b> <b>going</b> on to explain the relationship between theory of mind and language.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, Jean Bentley of MTV {{described}} [...] "Home" [...] as [...] "an hour {{of television}} {{better suited for}} Internet surfing than actually paying attention." [...] She criticized the songs as being unrecognizable to younger viewers, and called the main plots [...] "emotional doozies, with not much comic relief in between." [...] Bentley felt that Chenoweth was overused, and called her appearance in the episode [...] "nonsensical and unnecessary". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded the episode [...] "C". He felt that the three main plot strands were poorly balanced, resulting in an episode with [...] "powerful moments that drown as they're nearly subsumed by everything <b>else</b> <b>going</b> on." [...] VanDerWerff criticized Mercedes' storyline as being too abrupt, and deemed her performance of [...] "Beautiful": [...] "so forced that it loses any power it might have from what's a genuinely nice arrangement of the song." [...] Finally, he expressed his concern that the prevalence of songs in Glee may detract from {{the quality of the}} show. Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle also criticized the episode, deeming it the weakest of the series so far, and one that left him underwhelmed.|$|E

500|$|While Michael Cerveris has {{appeared}} as the Observer {{in the three}} previous episodes—and {{has appeared}} in every episode to date—his previous appearances had been brief background cameos. When initially cast for Fringe, Cerveris assumed he was a mere guest star, and that his character was [...] "one of several nuggets dropped in" [...] by J.J. Abrams {{in a manner similar}} to his other science fiction series, Lost. Cerveris soon discovered that his character was [...] "this sort of Where's Waldo thing (as) the linchpin in an overarching story of the series". He continued: Executive producer Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our goal was to take a character who is by definition unknowable and make him someone you can connect to emotionally. He's more specifically connected with the overall character mythology of the show than we ever expected." [...] The decision to remove his eyebrows was made an hour before he first appeared, which caused stress in the make-up department because Cerveris would not shave his eyebrows; he commented about the affair, [...] "I've got a little too much <b>else</b> <b>going</b> on, and who knows if they would ever grow back. I have little enough hair as it is." [...] "The Arrival" [...] was the first episode in which the Observer had dialogue, and the first in which he was treated as a focal character. In addition to Cerveris, actor Michael Kelly made a guest appearance in the episode.|$|E
500|$|With Rosberg {{retiring}} from Formula One {{at the end}} of 1986 season, underrated Swede Stefan Johansson filled the McLaren seat alongside Prost for the [...] season. Even though McLaren had introduced the new Steve Nichols designed MP4/3 after three seasons with the MP4/2 model (Barnard had departed for Ferrari), the TAG engines were not the force they had been previously, lagging behind in power and with unreliability previously unseen. He never gave up though and challenged Piquet and Mansell almost until the end, winning three races and breaking Jackie Stewart's record for race victories by winning for the 28th time at the Portuguese Grand Prix. Prost considers his win in the opening round in Brazil as his best and most rewarding race ever. The Williams-Hondas had been dominant during qualifying, and Prost started fifth on the grid with a time three seconds slower than Mansell's pole time. Knowing he didn't have the qualifying speed, he instead worked on his race set-up, and with everyone <b>else</b> <b>going</b> for a high-downforce set-up, the Frenchman went the other way. The set-up meant less tyre wear, thanks to slower speeds in the corners while going fast down the straights. With his car having less tyre wear than his rivals, Prost was able to get through the 61 laps of the abrasive Jacarepaguá Circuit with only two stops compared to the three or more by his rivals (Piquet pitted for tyres 3 times within the first 40 laps). Prost finished 40 seconds in front of Piquet, with Johansson a further 16 seconds back in third.|$|E

2500|$|The matches {{were well}} attended, but the press (especially the British contingent) was mainly sceptical. [...] "Of all the short-form matches {{currently}} being organised," [...] wrote Stephen Brenkley on 26 October, [...] "the conclusion is easily reached that Stanford Superstars v England {{is the most}} offensive. It has no context as a proper sporting competition, it is neither country versus country, club versus club or invitation XI versus invitation XI. It is a rococo hybrid.

2500|$|Graeme Thomson of Uncut {{was not so}} impressed, {{giving the}} album 2 stars out of 5 and stating [...] "You can't fault the raw material, but Collins brings nothing new to these songs.

For anyone <b>else,</b> <b>Going</b> Back is a heartfelt but pointless exercise in ersatz soul." [...] Terry Staunton of Record Collector was even more negative, defining the album as a set [...] "of 60s soul covers of baffling irrelevance" [...] and wondering, [...] "what possible use could anyone have for weedy-voiced faded Xeroxes of songs readily available in their wondrously uplifting original form?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Edge gave {{it one of}} {{its lowest}} scores, a 3 out of 10, saying [...] "The notion that playing games {{is a waste of}} your time is nonsense, of course, but... stuffed with a {{procession}} of long-winded loading sequences, protracted menu flipping and unskippable cutscenes, it often feels like there’s as much watching [...] as there is playing. Time wasted, in other words." [...] They criticized the many technical and graphical glitches, saying [...] "sometimes the lighting effects [...] mix textures into strange oily swirls, while at other times it feels like you’re driving one big polygon." [...] However, in the post script, they did concede that, while flawed, the game does have a clever concept and occasionally delivers those rare feelings of escapism that many arcade-style racers strive for: [...] "The Run may not have much <b>else</b> <b>going</b> for it, but in its unusual approach to the genre it at least tries to do something new." ...|$|E

He said the little Halls were coming, but Mrs. Taylor begun saying she disliked their company for the children--granny let them get about so much, and they said bad words. The father again interfered. Perhaps Mr. Wilmot, who acted as chaplain at the hospital, had been talking to him, for he declared at once that they should come; and Richard suggested that he might see them home when he came from church; then, turning to the boy and girl, told them they would meet their sister Lucy, and asked them if they would not like that.|$|E

It's a beastly shame, considering that Cook's has been a sort of school shop so long. And they really depend on the school. At least, one never sees anybody <b>else</b> <b>going</b> there. Well, I shall stick to Cook's. I don't want any of your beastly Yankee invaders. Support home industries. Be a patriot. The band then played God Save the King, and the meeting dispersed.

6000|$|There {{are plenty}} of other club-bores besides the man who rates these {{generally}} affable and well-behaved persons, the club servants. One of the worst is the man whom you never see anywhere except at the club, and whom you never fail to see there. It is bad enough when you have no acquaintance with him. Murders have probably been committed by sensitive persons for no better reason (often for worse reasons) than that they are tired of seeing some one <b>else</b> <b>going</b> about. His voice, his manner, his cough, especially his cough, become unendurable. People who cough in clubs are generally amateurs of the art. They are huskier, more wheezing, more pertinacious in working away at a cough till they have made it a masterpiece than any other mortals. We believe that club Asthmats (it is quite as good a word as [...] "AEsthetes") practise in the Reading Room of the British Museum, where they acquire their extraordinary compass and mastery of various notes. Be this as it may, the cough which drives every one but its owner out of the room (though doubtless an affliction to the proprietor) gives him rank as a club-bore of the finest water. The bore who always enters into conversation, though he has nothing to say, merely because you used to dislike him at school, or college, or elsewhere, is another common annoyance. The man who is engaged, apparently, on a large work, and who rushes about the library hunting for Proclus and Jamblichus when other occupants of the room wish to be quiet, is naturally detested.|$|E
