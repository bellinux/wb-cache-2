40|$|Abstract—We {{have been}} working on <b>dialogue</b> <b>control</b> for {{listening}} agents. In our previous study [1], we proposed a <b>dialogue</b> <b>control</b> method that maximizes user satisfaction using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and evaluated it by a dialogue simulation. We found that it significantly outperforms other stochastic <b>dialogue</b> <b>control</b> methods. However, this result {{does not necessarily mean that}} our method works as well in real dialogues with human users. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate our <b>dialogue</b> <b>control</b> method by a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) experiment. The experimental results show that our POMDP-based method achieves significantly higher user satisfaction than other stochastic models, confirming the validity of our approach. This paper is the first to show the usefulness of POMDP-based <b>dialogue</b> <b>control</b> using human users when the target function is to maximize user satisfaction. I...|$|E

We collected {{a large number of}} listening-oriented dialogues with their user satisfaction ratings and used them to create a <b>dialogue</b> <b>control</b> component using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which can learn a policy to satisfy users by automatically finding a reasonable reward function. A comparison between our POMDP-based component and other similarly motivated systems using human subjects revealed that POMDPs can satisfactorily produce a <b>dialogue</b> <b>control</b> component that can achieve reasonable subjective assessment. ...|$|E
40|$|In spoken {{dialogue}} applications dialogue {{management has}} conventionally been {{realized with a}} single monolithic dialogue manager implementing a comprehensive <b>dialogue</b> <b>control</b> model. We present a highly distributed system structure that enables the integration of different <b>dialogue</b> <b>control</b> approaches to handle spoken dialogues. With this structure {{it is possible to}} integrate multiple <b>dialogue</b> <b>control</b> models into a single working application in a flexible fashion. The main principle is that all the processing is distributed into many compact agents that focus on single tasks. The agents process the information independently and share all the information via shared information storage. We present the principles that enable such distribution. In addition, a multilingual example application, AthosMail, is presented. 1...|$|E

40|$|Dialogues {{are usually}} {{motivated}} by some underlying, noncommunicative goal. Participants {{in a dialogue}} therefore perform two tasks at once: that of trying to achieve the underlying noncommunicative goal, and that of communicating {{in order to achieve}} the associated communicative goal. This is reflected in the fact that dialogues consist not only of elements motivated by the underlying task, but also of elements motivated by the communicative task and dealing with aspects that require constant attention in communication, such as ensuring contact, providing feedback, monitoring the attention, taking turns, repairing communicative failures, etc. We use the term <b>dialogue</b> <b>control</b> to refer to these aspects of dialogue. In this paper we present an analysis of the various aspects of <b>dialogue</b> <b>control,</b> focusing on the identification and definition of the communicative functions of <b>dialogue</b> <b>control</b> acts in information-seeking dialogues. 1 Introduction Occasionally, the participants in [...] ...|$|E

VIM comprises a Prolog client linked by the Internet to a diagram graphics server linked by X/Motif to conventional 2 D display hardware.

ODL e-Assessment systems have evolved from Computer Assisted / Aided Assessment (CAA) systems through intelligent assessment and feedback systems. E-Assessment (electronic assessment) connotes using electronic technology and tools to design and administer assessments, collect and store students’ assessment evidences, grade performance, provide feedback and generate reports. The widely recognized advantages of e-Assessment over traditional, paper-based assessment include: lower long term costs, instant feedback to students, greater flexibility with respect to location and timing, improved reliability with machine marking, improved impartiality, and enhanced question styles that incorporate interactivity and multimedia.

40|$|During {{the five}} decades that have elapsed since it gained independence, Mauritania – {{a country that}} is lacking in natural {{resources}} and highly dependent on exterior aid – has prioritised its relations with the European regional system. These relations have been a reflection of the evolution of the principles of EU external action. Thus, during the period prior to the Maastricht Treaty, relations with Mauritania were framed within a collection of agreements based on development cooperation and fishing licences. However, with the introduction (in the 1990 s) of a European Common Foreign and Security Policy, provided with new principles, a new political dimension was introduced into these relations; a dimension that would demonstrate its importance in Mauritania’s recent political evolution. In this context, the aim of this article is: to analyse the main elements that have determined the evolution of this process of relations between the European Union and Mauritania; {{to examine the effects of}} the introduction of political criteria into this cooperation, and its impact on Mauritania’s increasing closeness to the Euro-Mediterranean space; and to highlight, particularly, Spain’s role with respect to designing EU strategies in areas of particular importance for our country’s interests, such as political <b>dialogue,</b> <b>controlling</b> migration flows and fishing...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a web-enabled serious game {{intended to help}} German-speaking beginner students of English improve their generative and auditory competence. The tool is built {{on top of the}} existing CALL-SLT platform, the architecture of which is briefly described. It offers a short course of 8 interactive lessons using a combined vocabulary of about 450 words, and was developed in collaboration with a secondary school teacher, with the content taken from a commonly used textbook. Lessons are structured as a short dialogue between the student and the machine, where the student is encouraged to use simple language in practical contexts like booking a hotel room, buying clothes, or ordering a meal in a restaurant. A lesson connects together groups of component examples. At each turn, the system starts by playing a short video file in English, and simultaneously displays a piece of text in German indicating to the student how they should reply. The students give a spoken response in English; if they are uncertain how to respond, they can first ask for a help example. After the student answers, the system performs speech recognition, machine translation and matching, and either accepts or rejects. There are multiple paths through the <b>dialogue,</b> <b>controlled</b> by a lesson structure defined in an XML file supplied by the course designer.
