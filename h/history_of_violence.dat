5|$|With ultra-violent {{films such}} as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Thirst (2009), Park Chan-wook of South Korea {{has been the most}} {{prominent}} director outside of the United States to work regularly in a noir mode in the new millennium. The most commercially successful neo-noir of this period has been Sin City (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez in extravagantly stylized black and white with the odd bit of color. The film is based on a series of comic books created by Frank Miller (credited as the film's codirector), which are in turn openly indebted to the works of Spillane and other pulp mystery authors. Another comic book adaptation with similar style and elements is The Spirit (2008). This film is adapted from the comic book of the same name originally created by cartoonist Will Eisner. Similarly, graphic novels provide the basis for Road to Perdition (2002), directed by Sam Mendes, and A <b>History</b> <b>of</b> <b>Violence</b> (2005), directed by David Cronenberg; the latter was voted best film {{of the year in the}} annual Village Voice poll. Writer-director Rian Johnson's Brick (2005), featuring present-day high schoolers speaking a version of 1930s hardboiled argot, won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival. The television series Veronica Mars (2004–07) also brought a youth-oriented twist to film noir. Examples of this sort of generic crossover have been dubbed teen noir.|$|E

40|$|Background One {{in three}} women in Australia will {{experience}} sexual violence {{at some time}} in their life. Although these women use health services more than nonvictimised women, they may not receive the holistic care they need if their sexual trauma history is not known. Objective This article discusses the importance of opportunistically identifying a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence</b> in women presenting to general practice in order to provide optimal healthcare and avoid iatrogenic retraumatisation. Discussion A <b>history</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence</b> is associated with an increased incidence of long term physical and psychological health problems, psychosocial difficulties, risk taking behaviours and premature death. Most survivors do not disclose a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence</b> to their doctors. Without this context, their ongoing health issues may not be fully understood, leading to suboptimal care. A safe environment is vital to support disclosure. General practitioners are well placed to identify, support and treat and/or appropriately refer women with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence.</b> Priorities in management include addressing the pervasive long term consequences <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence,</b> encouraging preventive care and avoiding inadvertent retraumatisation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective. This study {{examines}} the asso-ciation between having a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> dating <b>violence</b> {{and the sexual}} health of adolescent females. Methods.

25|$|Aboriginals {{are also}} more likely to be the victims of crime. This is {{particularly}} true in the younger population (aged 15–34), where acts of violence are two and a half times more likely to occur than in the older population. Domestic violence and sexual abuse against children is more prevalent in the Aboriginal population with sexual abuse affecting 25–50% of Aboriginal female children versus 20–25% of female children in the general population. Children who come from homes with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> are at a greater risk of becoming the perpetrators of violence later in life. This is especially true of males.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundYouth {{reporting}} combined <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> nonfatal <b>violence,</b> suicidal ideation/behavior, and gun-carrying (VSG) are at {{risk for}} perpetrating fatal interpersonal violence and self-harm. AimsWe characterize these youth to inform prevention efforts. MethodsWe analyzed 2004 data from 3, 931 7 th, 9 th, and 112 ̆ 01312 th grade youth and compared VSG youth (n= 66) to non-gun carrying youth who either had no <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> or suicidal thoughts/behavior (n= 1, 839), <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> (n= 884), <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> suicidal thoughts/behaviors (n= 552), or both (n= 590). We compared groups based on demographic factors, risk factors (i. e., friends who engage in delinquency, peer-violence victimization, depressive symptoms, illicit substance use), and protective factors (i. e., school connectedness, parental care and supervision). Regression models identified factors associated with VSG youth. ResultsIllicit substance use and having friends who engage in delinquency were more common among VSG youth in all comparisons; almost all VSG youth had high-levels of these factors. Depressive symptoms were positively associated with VSG youth versus youth without either violent or suicide-related histories and youth with violent histories alone. School connectedness and parental supervision were negatively associated with VSG youth in most comparisons. ConclusionsFamily-focused and school-based interventions that increase connectedness while reducing delinquency and substance use might prevent these violent tendencies.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] It {{has been suggested that}} domestic violence is not only highly prevalent and associated with significant morbidity, but that it is also overlooked by medical practitioners. Despite this, few studies have focused on domestic violence in the South African setting, so that there is a paucity of data here on its prevalence, phenomenology, and associated psychopathology. Methods. Sixteen general practitioners from the South African Sentinel Practitioner Research Network (SASPREN) screened all their female patients aged 18 years or older for a 3 -month period (N = 1. 050). A sociodemographic questionnaire was completed, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression were assessed, both in subjects with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>violence</b> and in a control group without such a history. Results. 21. 5 % of patients reported a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>violence</b> at screening. Patients and controls did not differ significantly in terms of age or race. However, patients with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>violence</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} be married, not to have begun a high-school education, and to be working outside the home. Both PTSD and major depression were significantly more common in patients with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>violence</b> (35. 3 % and 48. 2 %, respectively) than in controls (2. 6 % and 11. 4 %, respectively). Compared with other patients reporting domestic violence, those with either PTSD or major depression were subjected to more violence and were more likely to report a suicide attempt. Conclusion. In a large, diverse population of adult female patients presenting to a range of general practitioners in South Africa, there was a high prevalence <b>of</b> reported domestic <b>violence.</b> A significant association was found between domestic violence and both PTSD and major depression, with these diagnoses indicative of increased severity of abuse and increased morbidity. Routine screening by medical practitioners of all female patients for a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>violence</b> seems warranted, and patients with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>violence</b> should be assessed for PTSD and depression.
