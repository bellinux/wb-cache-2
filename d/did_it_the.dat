500|$|Although Brown coached {{dozens of}} {{successful}} teams {{at the high}} school, college and professional levels, his controlling personality and sharp criticisms made him unpopular with many players. Brown was a methodical and disciplined coach who tolerated no deviation from his system. His professional teams' planes did not wait for players who were late; anyone who missed the flight was forced to find one {{on his own and}} pay a fine to Brown. When the Browns practiced twice in a day in training camp, each session was exactly 55 minutes. Regular practices during the season lasted an hour and 12 minutes. Players who made mistakes in games were held up for ridicule during film review sessions. [...] "There got to be a saying", longtime Browns safety Ken Konz said years later.

2500|$|Cheney later {{stated that}} he was trying to prove to critics that The Living End were not a band simply defined by their hit, [...] "Prisoner of Society", and the album showed this by {{displaying}} other influences, as well as their traditional fast-paced rockabilly music. Rolling Stone Jenny Eiscu compared it to The Clash's creative breakthrough, London Calling (December 1979), as they [...] "stomp all over the boundaries between punk, reggae, rockabilly and plain old rock & roll – and it still sounds like a revelation, twenty-two years after he Clash <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> pupils don't quite outpace the masters here ... But the band is obviously having such a riotously good time that you'd be a sucker not to stomp your foot and join the party". Much of the style was comparable to 1980s hard rock and pub rock, as well as many tracks being obscure mixes of many ideas, resulting in 'procrastinating' structures. This defined the album's creativity.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{reports of}} the bombing {{and the loss of}} four children's lives were glorified by white supremacists, who in many {{instances}} chose to celebrate the loss as [...] "four less niggers", as news of the church bombing and the fact that four young girls had been killed in the explosion reached the national and international press, many felt that they had not taken the civil rights struggle seriously enough. The day following the bombing, a young white lawyer named Charles Morgan Jr. addressed a meeting of businessmen, condemning the acquiescence of white people in Birmingham towards the oppression of blacks. In this speech, Morgan addressed his audience with a speech in which he lamented: [...] "Who did it ? We all <b>did</b> <b>it!</b> <b>The</b> 'who' is every little individual who talks about the 'niggers' and spreads the seeds of his hate to his neighbor and his son ... What's it like living in Birmingham? No one ever really has known and no one will until this city becomes part of the United States."
