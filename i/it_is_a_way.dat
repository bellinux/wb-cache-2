25|$|Social {{influence}} {{is a factor}} in every individual's life. Social influence takes place when one's thoughts, actions and feelings are affected by other people. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of interaction that affects individual behavior and can occur within groups and between groups. It is a fundamental process that affects ways of socialization, conformity, leadership and social change.|$|E
25|$|Once {{a year in}} October {{the kingdom}} of Onitsha holds the Ofala Festival which coincides with the {{traditional}} New Yam festival held {{in many parts of}} Igboland. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for the people of Onitsha to keep their culture alive and it has become a major event that draws visitors from far and wide to the city.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{understanding}} is a cerebral mode of comprehension, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of thinking, {{and thus is}} not dependent upon external expression. Yet it requires external manifestation {{in order to be}} communicated. The expression of critical understanding can take various forms including formal or informal speech, academic writing, creative prose or poetry or visual outcomes. It can take different forms in different cultures and this needs to be taken into consideration when assessing critical results.|$|E

50|$|Feudalism <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{combination}} {{of legal and}} military customs in medieval Europe that flourished between the 9th and 15th centuries. Broadly defined, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of structuring society around relationships derived from the holding of land in exchange for service or labour.|$|R
5|$|Quoting the Jewish rabbi and scholar Jacob Neusner, Pope Benedict XVI {{explains}} that to Israel, keeping this commandment {{was more than}} ritual; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to imitate God, who rested on the seventh day after the creation. It also constituted {{the core of the}} social order.|$|R
25|$|Collaboration {{is a way}} to get {{everyone}} involved in the group by assigning each member special, meaningful tasks. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for the group members to share the knowledge and the tasks to be fulfilled unfailingly. For example, if Sally and Paul were loafing because they were not given specific tasks, then giving Paul the note taker duty and Sally the brainstorming duty will make them feel essential to the group. Sally and Paul will be less likely to want to let the group down, because they have specific obligations to complete.|$|E
25|$|Similar to yoga, {{learning}} the Tree of Life {{is not so}} much Magick as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to map out one's spiritual universe. As such, the adept may use the Tree to determine a destination for astral travel, to choose which gods to invoke for what purposes, et cetera. It also {{plays an important role in}} modeling the spiritual journey, where the adept begins in Malkuth, which is the every-day material world of phenomena, with the ultimate goal being at Kether, the sphere of Unity with the All.|$|E
25|$|However, some Japanese fans {{of hip-hop}} find it {{embarrassing}} and ridiculous that these blackface fans {{do this because}} {{they feel like they}} shouldn't change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances it {{can be seen as a}} racist act, but for many of the young the Japanese fans <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit. For example, the Japanese hip hop group Soul'd Out is extremely imitative of African American culture. Looking at Soul'd Out, their appearance stands out. Their wardrobe undoubtedly reminds one of African American fashion.|$|E
50|$|From a {{different}} perspective, {{we see that}} the movie <b>was</b> <b>a</b> beginning of an Egyptian series that views various poor traits in the world generally and the Egyptian community specifically. All that's presented in a comedic sense as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to deliver <b>a</b> message to the public in <b>a</b> nicer <b>way.</b>|$|R
50|$|Club owner Charlie Finley had a pitchometer on the scoreboard. In {{an attempt}} {{to speed up the}} game, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to measure the time a pitcher spent in between pitches thrown.

50|$|Frank Tunney and Eddie Quinn {{invested}} in the St. Louis territory in June 1948. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> {{to ensure that the}} NWA World Champion would make appearances in Toronto and Montreal. The territories in Toronto and Montreal were not granted membership in the NWA until November 1949. Tunney kept his stake in St. Louis until 1974.|$|R
25|$|The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) {{provides}} {{various activities}} {{that attempt to}} increase sustainability practices among individuals and institutions, promote resource sharing, and make sustainable practices a norm within higher education institutions. The Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS), created by AASHE, was designed to provide guidelines for better understanding of sustainability and build a more sustainable community throughout university campuses. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for universities and colleges to measure their sustainability efforts. The program compares higher education facilities’ sustainability initiatives and ranks them based on their efforts. In 2011, the University of Ottawa received a silver star by the STARS program.|$|E
25|$|In {{basically}} {{all major}} primate taxa, aggression {{is used by}} the dominant males when herding females and keeping them away from other males. In hamadryas baboons, the males often bite the females’ necks and threaten them. Wild chimpanzees can charge at females, shake branches, hit, slap, kick, pound, drag, and bite them. Orangutans are among the most forceful of mammals. Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) exhibited aggression in almost 90 percent of their copulations, including when the females were not resisting. A possible explanation for aggressive behaviors in primates is that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for males to train females to be afraid of them and be more likely to surrender to future sexual advances.|$|E
25|$|The {{geometric}} or floral, interlaced forms, taken together, {{constitute an}} infinitely repeated pattern that {{extends beyond the}} visible material world. To many in the Islamic world, they symbolize the concept of infinite proves of existence of one eternal God. The repetitiveness, simplicity contrasted with complexity and percision suggests that our complex universe {{is only one of}} the many manifestations of the infinitely obvious and present Allah, the one God. Furthermore, the Islamic artist conveys a definite spirituality without the iconography of Christian art. Non-figural ornaments are used in mosques and buildings around the Muslim world, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of decorating using beautiful, embellishing and repetitive Islamic art instead of using pictures of humans and animals (which some Muslims believe is forbidden (Haram) in Islam).|$|E
50|$|England and Scotland practised privateering both {{separately}} and together after they united {{to create the}} Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to gain for themselves some of the wealth the Spanish and Portuguese were taking from the New World before beginning their own trans-Atlantic settlement, and <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to assert naval power before a strong Royal Navy emerged.|$|R
50|$|Anime Test Drive <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{promotion}} {{that started}} in 2003 which tested the markets and introduced American's to anime at <b>a</b> discounted rate. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to market titles {{that may have been}} viewed as to expensive or inconvenience to purchase separately. Anime Test Drive DVDs offer two episodes of the listed anime series and 45 minutes of trailers.|$|R
2500|$|In 1964, Danish Fashion {{historian}} Rudolf Kristian Albert Broby-Johansen {{wrote that}} the topless look, which liberated breasts from bras, should be treated seriously. He asserted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for <b>a</b> new generation of women to express themselves. In 1969, he wrote an article titled [...] "Obituary for the Bra" [...] in which he predicted the imminent demise of bras.|$|R
25|$|The {{objective}} is also cultural. The movement aims {{to bring a}} new look on Syria by focusing on its cultural diversity and richness, beyond ubiquitous images of despair. According to Leila Shahid for La Marseilleise, Syria is a great cultural nation, a pluricultural leader of artistic creation. Journalist Alain Laurens commented that the Syrian cultural caravan’s involvement makes the public forget during the performance about all the bombings in Aleppo and Damascus and {{make room for a}} humane and fraternal communion. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of showing that the Syrian cultural scene and its artists is alive and thriving. Finally, the road trip allows the Cultural Caravan to make art and culture come to the people, therefore going upstream of artistic and cultural centralisation. Most of the time, the exhibition is set up outside, making it accessible to a greater number.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{older men}} and women {{maintaining}} interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of expressing their love and care for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood {{have been found to}} contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women {{were more likely to report}} a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both aging genders agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{communities}} in Yemen, {{prior to their}} immigration to the Land of Israel, did not place headstones over the graves of the dead, except only on rare occasions, choosing rather to follow the dictum of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel who said: “They do not build monuments (i.e. tombstones) for the righteous. Their words, lo! They are their memorial!” Philosopher and Halachic decisor, Maimonides, likewise, ruled {{that it is not}} permissible to raise headstones over the graves of righteous men, but permits doing so for ordinary men. In contrast, the more recent custom of Spanish Jewry, following the teachings of the Ari z”l (Shaʿar Ha-Mitzvot, Parashat Vayeḥi), is to build tombstones over the grave, seeing it as part of the complete atonement and amendment for those who have died. Likewise, Rabbi Shelomo b. Avraham Aderet (RASHBA) wrote that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of showing honor to the dead. In this manner the custom did spread, especially among the Jews of Spain, North Africa and Ashkenaz. Today, in Israel, all Jewish graves are marked with headstones.|$|E
50|$|A counter-intuitive use of {{the term}} was the Chasam Sofer's novel {{interpretation}} of the phrase Chadash asur min haTorah, ("'new' is forbidden by the Torah"). The phrase as originally used is regarding the laws of keeping kosher, whereas his use was regarding changes being made by the Reform movement in Europe: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of saying no - but using a pun.|$|R

500|$|This [...] "system" [...] {{is still}} {{controversial}} to many guests. Some {{view it as}} a way to cut lines by paying extra money. Ironically Cedar Point did have a similar system in the early 2000s(first called Ticket to Ride and then FreeWay), but has in 2004 discontinued it because they were charged with [...] "sanctioning line-jumping". This Fast Pass is the updated version which is supposed to be less problematic for other guests, even though the general idea is the same. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to make lines shorter only for the people with the Pass.
