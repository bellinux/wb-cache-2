5|$|After {{the active}} {{portion of a}} seizure (the ictal state) there is {{typically}} a period of recovery during which there is confusion, {{referred to as the}} postictal period before a normal level of consciousness returns. It usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes but may last for hours. Other common symptoms include feeling tired, headache, difficulty speaking, and abnormal behavior. Psychosis after a seizure is relatively common, occurring in 6–10% of people. Often people <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> what happened during this time. Localized weakness, known as Todd's paralysis, may also occur after a focal seizure. When it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two.|$|E
5|$|Sen, No-Face and Boh {{meet with}} the now benevolent Zeniba, who reveals that Sen's love for Haku broke her curse and that Yubaba used the black slug to control Haku. Haku appears in his dragon form and flies Sen and Boh to the bathhouse. No-Face becomes Zeniba's spinner. In midflight, Sen recalls falling in her youth into the Kohaku River and being washed safely ashore, thus {{revealing}} Haku's real identity as the Kohaku River. When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her parents from {{among a group of}} pigs in order to break their curse. After Sen answers that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract combusts and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents, who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> anything. They quietly walk back to their car (which is now covered in dust) and drive away.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosing {{sleep apnea}} usually {{requires}} a professional sleep study {{performed in a}} sleep clinic, because the episodes of wakefulness caused by the disorder are extremely brief and patients usually <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> experiencing them. Instead, many patients simply feel tired after getting several hours of sleep and have no idea why. Major risk factors for sleep apnea include chronic fatigue, old age, obesity and snoring.|$|E

They <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> {{the science behind}} their technology, save for Zeus and Hephaestus, and they are described both as preliterate and post-literate, for which reason they enlist the services of Thomas Hockenberry and other scholics. They dwell on Olympus Mons on Mars and use quantum teleportation {{in order to get}} to the recreation of Troy on an alternate Earth. Though the events of the Trojan War are being recreated with the knowledge of Homer's Iliad, the only ones who know its outcome are the scholics and Zeus as Zeus has forbade the other gods from knowing.|$|E
25|$|Other body systems {{affected}} by Lyme-like Disease. More common than EM are symptoms due to invasion by the spirochaete {{of the nervous}} system, heart, muscles and joints. These may start weeks or months after the tickbite. Initially, they may include flu-like illness, fever, headache, sore throat, fatigue, aching muscles and joints. More serious are meningitis, Bell's palsy (weakness of the face muscles), swelling of joints, and heart problems with palpitations and breathlessness. Lyme disease is difficult to distinguish from many other illnesses like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) because the symptoms may be similar. If you have symptoms that could be Lyme disease, even if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> a tickbite, see your doctor. Diagnosis is helped by a blood test called a Western Blot test, but your doctor will consider whether any other illness could be causing your symptoms and may do some other tests.|$|E

500|$|Confirmation bias {{is a form}} of {{cognitive}} bias, a psychological factor that contributes to belief in astrology. [...] Astrology believers tend to selectively remember predictions that turn out to be true, and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> those that turn out false. Another, separate, form of confirmation bias also plays a role, where believers often fail to distinguish between messages that demonstrate special ability and those that do not. Thus there are two distinct forms of confirmation bias that are under study with respect to astrological belief.|$|E

"Window of Opportunity" [...] is {{the sixth}} episode from season 4 {{of the science}} fiction {{television}} series Stargate SG-1, and first aired on the American subscription channel Showtime on August 4, 2000.

The flashback in Thanksgiving 1987 was Monica and Chandler's first meeting along with Rachel and Chandler. Bright commented that the show tries not to contradict itself; [...] "once we establish something, {{we try not to}} undo it." [...] In [...] "The Pilot" [...] it appears Rachel meets Chandler for the first time. She also meets him in a later flashback episode, [...] "The One Where The Stripper Cries". To excuse the continuity error, Bright adds they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> each other meeting because they look different.|$|E

500|$|Gens {{was born}} on 1 April 1903 in [...] near Šiauliai {{in what was then}} the Russian Empire and is now Lithuania. His father was a {{merchant}} and Gens was the oldest of four sons. Gens attended a Russian-language primary school and then a secondary school in Šiauliai. He was fluent in Lithuanian, Russian, German, and Yiddish, and knew some Hebrew, Polish, and English. In 1919, Gens enlisted in the newly formed Lithuanian Army. He was sent to officers' school and completed the training as a junior lieutenant. N. Karni, who was a cadet with Gens, said that he [...] "had great personal charm. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> him ever being in a bad mood." [...] Karni also felt Gens had [...] "leadership qualities, he had personality, {{he was a man of}} principles". Gens' participation in the Polish–Lithuanian War and the completion of his secondary schooling earned Gens a promotion to senior lieutenant.|$|E
500|$|As [...] "Kenny", {{as he was}} {{sometimes}} known, grew, he did an increasing share of the farm work, later stating, [...] "I did my share—and it was a substantial share—in {{taking care of the}} 13acres... I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> that I particularly liked to get up at 3:30 in the morning." [...] Kenesaw began his off-farm career at age ten as a news delivery boy. [...] He left school at 15 after an unsuccessful attempt to master algebra; he then worked at the local general store. He left that job for a position as errand boy with the Vandalia Railroad. Landis applied for a job as a brakeman, but was laughingly dismissed as too small. He then worked for the Logansport Journal, and taught himself shorthand reporting, becoming in 1883 official court reporter for the Cass County Circuit Court. [...] Landis later wrote, [...] "I may not have been much of a judge, nor baseball official, but I do pride myself on having been a real shorthand reporter." [...] He served in that capacity until 1886. In his spare time, he became a prize-winning bicycle racer and played on and managed a baseball team. Offered a professional contract as a ballplayer, he turned it down, stating that he preferred to play for the love of the game.|$|E
500|$|The Ohio Legislature elected Sherman to a {{third term}} in 1872 after then-governor Rutherford B. Hayes {{declined}} the invitation of several legislators to run against Sherman. Sherman returned to his leadership of the Finance Committee, and the issues of greenbacks, gold, and silver continued into the next several congresses. Since {{the early days of}} the republic, the United States had minted both gold and silver coins, and for decades the ratio of value between them had been set by law at 16:1. Both metals were subject to [...] "free coinage"; that is, anyone could bring any amount of silver or gold to the United States Mint and have it converted to coinage. The ratio was bound to be imperfect, as the amount of gold and silver mined and the demand for it around the world fluctuated from year to year; as a metal's market price exceeded its legal price, coins of that metal would disappear from circulation (a phenomenon known as Gresham's law). Before the Civil War, gold circulated freely and silver disappeared, and while silver dollars were legal tender, Sherman wrote that [...] "lthough I was quite active in business... I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> at that time to have ever seen a silver dollar". The issuance of greenbacks had pushed debate over gold-silver ratios to the background as coins of both metals disappeared from the nation's commerce in favor of the new paper notes, but as the dollar became stronger in peacetime and the national debt payments were guaranteed to be paid in specie, Congress saw the need to update the coinage laws.|$|E

500|$|... "For June Bolan, {{the alarm}} bells began to sound only when Syd kept his girlfriend under {{lock and key}} for three days, {{occasionally}} shoving a ration of biscuits under the door." [...] A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic Jonathan Meades. [...] "I went [...] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like heating pipes shaking. I said, 'What's up?' and he sort of giggled and said, 'That's Syd having a bad trip. We put him in the linen cupboard'". Storm Thorgerson responded to this claim by stating [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> locking Syd up in a cupboard. It sounds to me like pure fantasy, like Jonathan Meades was on dope himself." [...] Other friends assert that Barrett's infamous flatmates, [...] "Mad Jock" [...] and [...] "Mad Sue," [...] believed that acid held all the answers and thought of Barrett as a genius or [...] "god," [...] and were spiking his morning coffee with LSD every day without his knowledge, leaving him in a never-ending trip. He was later rescued from that flat by friends and moved elsewhere, but his erratic behavior continued. Watkinson and Anderson included quotes from a story told to them by Thorgerson that underscored how volatile Barrett could be. [...] "On one occasion, I had to pull him off Lindsay (Barrett's girlfriend at the time) because he was beating her over the head with a mandolin". On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour's house. These strange behaviors contradicted Barrett's usually gentle nature. According to Gilmour in an interview with Nick Kent, the other members of Pink Floyd approached psychiatrist R. D. Laing with the 'Barrett problem'. After hearing a tape of a Barrett conversation, Laing declared him [...] "incurable".|$|E
