25|$|It {{has been}} shown that <b>free</b> <b>riding,</b> or reaping the {{benefits}} without any effort, is often a problem in collective action. Examples of <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> would be if an employee in a labor union pays no dues, but still benefits from union representation. In a study published in 1995, scientists found that female lions showed individual differences in {{the extent to which they}} participated in group-territorial conflict. Some lions consistently 'cooperated' by approaching intruders, while others 'lagged' behind to avoid the risk of fighting. Although the lead female recognized the laggards, she failed to punish them, suggesting that cooperation is not maintained by reciprocity.|$|E

25|$|Minimize free riding: <b>Free</b> <b>riding</b> {{occurs when}} members do less work {{because some of}} the {{benefits}} accrue to others. As others contribute ideas, individuals may feel less motivated to work hard themselves. They see their own contributions as less necessary or less likely to have much impact. To eliminate these effects, it is important to make group members feel that their contributions are essential for the group’s success. Additionally, it is less likely for someone to free-ride if they are in a small group.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method of}} {{overcoming}} the free rider {{problem is to}} simply eliminate the profit incentive for <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> by buying out all the potential free riders. A property developer that owned an entire city street, for instance, would not {{need to worry about}} free riders when erecting street lights since he owns every business that could benefit from the street light without paying. Implicitly, then, the property developer would erect street lights until the marginal social benefit met the marginal social cost. In this case, they are equivalent to the private marginal benefits and costs.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{literature}} suggests that <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> can be overcome without any state intervention. Peer-to-peer punishment, that is, members sanction those members that do {{not contribute to the}} public good at a cost, is sufficient to establish and maintain cooperation. Such punishment is often considered altruistic, because it comes at a cost to the punisher, however, the exact nature remains to be explored. Whether costly punishment can explain cooperation is disputed. Recent research finds that costly punishment is less effective in real world environments. For example, punishment works relatively badly under imperfect information, where people cannot observe the behavior of other perfectly.|$|E

25|$|First, {{the court}} held that an {{imitation}} leading to confusion as to the source of the websites and the associated <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> on the goodwill of Facebook's website requires a certain degree of public awareness of the website. However, {{at the time of the}} introduction of StudiVz to the German market (November 2005) Facebook had not yet established the critical level of awareness in order to justify a claim for improper imitation of a famous website. Rather, until September 2006, Facebook was only designed for North American students and thus did not reach the required degree of public awareness.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory is}} that these {{problems}} are caused by a structural contradiction within the euro system, the {{theory is that}} there is a monetary union (common currency) without a fiscal union (e.g., common taxation, pension, and treasury functions). In the Eurozone system, the countries are required to follow a similar fiscal path, but they do not have common treasury to enforce it. That is, countries with the same monetary system have freedom in fiscal policies in taxation and expenditure. So, even though there are some agreements on monetary policy and through the European Central Bank, countries may not be able to or would simply choose not to follow it. This feature brought fiscal <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> of peripheral economies, especially represented by Greece, as it is hard to control and regulate national financial institutions. Furthermore, there is also a problem that the Eurozone system has a difficult structure for quick response. Eurozone, having 18 nations as its members, require unanimous agreement for a decision making process. This would lead to failure in complete prevention of contagion of other areas, as it would be hard for the Eurozone to respond quickly to the problem.|$|E
500|$|Large game hunting {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} as a signal of men’s willingness to take physical risks, as well as showcase strength and coordination. Costly signalling theory is {{a useful tool for}} understanding food sharing among hunter gatherers because it can be applied to situations in which delayed reciprocity is not a viable explanation. Instances that are particularly inconsistent with the delayed reciprocity hypothesis are those in which a hunter shares his kill indiscriminately with all members of a large group. In these situations, the individuals sharing meat have no control over whether or not their generosity will be reciprocated, and <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> becomes an attractive strategy for those receiving meat. Free riders are people who reap the benefits of group-living without contributing to its maintenance. [...] Fortunately, costly signalling theory can fill some of the gaps left by the delayed reciprocity hypothesis. Hawkes has suggested that men target large game and publicly share meat to draw social attention or to show off. Such display and the resulting favorable attention can improve a hunter’s reputation by providing information about his phenotypic quality. High quality signallers are more successful in acquiring mates and allies. Thus, costly signalling theory can explain apparently wasteful and altruistic behaviour.|$|E

500|$|The squad {{was dead}} last of 23 {{teams in the}} stage 1 team time trial, losing {{more than a minute}} to the winners , a result later {{described}} by team captain Antón as [...] "a bit ugly". Antón finished with the group of overall favorites in the selective fifth and seventh stages, and was solidly eighth in stage 9 when eventual Giro champion Alberto Contador won the day and first took the race lead, but sat only in 11th place as a result. The squad was, as could be expected, far more successful in the second and more mountainous half of the race. Antón's ride on stage 13 ending at Grossglockner in Austria moved him into the top ten overall for the first time, at seventh place, though he was again distanced from Contador {{at the front of the}} race and lay over four minutes down. The next day's stage ended at Monte Zoncolan, one of the steepest climbs in all of professional cycling. Antón rode with the top overall riders until about [...] to go, when he attacked and broke <b>free.</b> <b>Riding</b> for a time with Contador and Joaquim Rodríguez, who had bridged up, Antón put in another attack with [...] left to go, and surpassed the remaining riders from the morning breakaway to occupy first position on the road. He rode alone to the finish for the stage win, by 33 seconds over Contador in second place. Antón revealed after the stage that he had never ridden the climb before, having only seen it on television. He admitted it was a risk to attack for victory from as far out as he did and that he suffered badly in the final few kilometers, but was still able to hold on. Antón called the Zoncolan climb [...] "mythical" [...] and [...] "absolutely the hardest climb for a bike race." [...] The result installed him into third place overall, still more than three minutes down on Contador but only a single second behind Vincenzo Nibali for second place. Antón mused that he may try to hold on to his podium placing to the conclusion of the race.|$|E
