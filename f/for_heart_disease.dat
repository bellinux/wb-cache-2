5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may {{lower the risk of}} heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors <b>for</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Increased iron {{stores and}} {{haemochromatosis}} gene mutations may be risk factors <b>for</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> The aims {{of this study}} were to determine in a stable community population whether increased iron stores or haemochromatosis gene mutations were risk factors <b>for</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Design Cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies. Methods: We evaluated 1185 men and 1141 women aged 20 – 79 years of predominantly Anglo-Celtic descent from the 1994 – 95 assessment of the Busselton population in Western Australia. Subjects underwent haemochromatosis genotyping, serum iron studies, clinical, biochemical and ECG evaluation <b>for</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and associated risk factors. Hospital admissions or death from cardiovascular disease were determined by linkage with the Western Australian morbidity and mortality database. The study design was cross-sectional for the 1994 – 95 cohort comparing coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> cases with unaffected subjects and unaffected subjects were followed prospectively until December 1998. Results: Cross-sectional and prospective cohort analyses demonstrated that elevated serum iron parameters or possession of either the C 282 Y or H 63 D mutations in the HFE gene were not predictive of increased risk <b>for</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in men or women. Conclusions: Increased iron stores or haemochromatosis gene mutations are not significant risk factors <b>for</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R

This measures total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides. It is recommended to test cholesterol at least every five years if a person has total cholesterol of 5.2mmol/L or more (200+mg/dL), or if a man over age 45 or a woman over age 50 has HDL (good) cholesterol less than 1mmol/L (40mg/dL), or there are other risk factors <b>for</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and stroke.

25|$|Arterial damage {{results from}} {{white blood cell}} {{invasion}} and inflammation within the wall. CRP is a general marker for inflammation and infection, {{so it can be}} used as a very rough proxy <b>for</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> risk. Since many things can cause elevated CRP, this is not a very specific prognostic indicator. Nevertheless, a level above 2.4mg/L has been associated with a doubled risk of a coronary event compared to levels below 1mg/L; however, the study group in this case consisted of patients who had been diagnosed with unstable angina pectoris; whether elevated CRP has any predictive value of acute coronary events in the general population of all age ranges remains unclear. Currently, C-reactive protein is not recommended as a cardiovascular disease screening test for average-risk adults without symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Other {{studies have}} shown that a high resting heart rate is {{associated}} with an increase in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic disease. A faster resting heart rate is associated with shorter life expectancy and is considered a strong risk factor <b>for</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and heart failure, independent of level of physical fitness. Specifically, a resting heart rate above 65 beats per minute has been shown to have a strong independent effect on premature mortality; every 10 beats per minute increase in resting heart rate {{has been shown to be}} associated with a 10–20% increase in risk of death. In one study, men with no evidence of heart disease and a resting heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute had a five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Similarly, another study found that men with resting heart rates of over 90 beats per minute had an almost two-fold increase in risk for cardiovascular disease mortality; in women it was associated with a three-fold increase.|$|E
