25|$|Two legal {{challenges}} to Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage ban were {{heard in the}} High Court in November and December 2015. Two couples, Grainne Close and Shannon Sickles and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kanem brought the case claiming that Northern Ireland's prohibition on same-sex marriage breached their human rights. The case was heard simultaneously with a case brought in January 2015 in which two men who wed in England sought to have their marriage recognised in Northern Ireland. A ruling was handed down in August 2017; Judge O'Hara found against the couples and determined {{that there were no}} grounds under case law from the European Court of Human Rights that the couple’s rights were violated by Northern Ireland's refusal to recognise their union as a marriage.

25|$|Some U.S. {{retailers}} offer {{opportunities for}} consumer recycling of discarded electronic devices.

CEA {{research has found that}} 58 percent of consumers know where to take their end-of-life electronics, and the electronics industry would very much like to see that level of awareness increase. Consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers sponsor or operate more than 5,000 recycling locations nationwide and <b>have</b> <b>vowed</b> <b>to</b> recycle one billion pounds annually by 2016, a sharp increase from 300 million pounds industry recycled in 2010.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} six days of the Kuttantavar festival, Aravan's head (cami) is [...] "danced" [...] around the streets of Kuvagam, with music and {{fireworks}} accompanying it. Each household offers a puja (a kind of devotional ceremony) to Aravan, with lamp-waving, coconut-offerings and other rituals. Traditionally, goats and chickens are sacrificed. On the 13thday, Aravan's [...] "soul" [...] is ritually transferred from his head to a pot, and the head is repainted. On {{the evening of the}} 14thday, a [...] high post is erected on a processional chariot. The post will support Aravan's head and body later in the festival. After the post-setting ceremony (kampam niruttatal), young and middle-aged men (farmers and traders from Koovagam and surrounding villages) who <b>have</b> <b>vowed</b> <b>to</b> marry Aravan purchase thalis—the traditional mark of a married woman, in this case a pendant with a piece of turmeric at its centre. The priest, representing Aravan, ties the thalis around their necks in the inner sanctum of the temple. Even married men and men afflicted with diseases, all dressed as women, are described as ritually [...] "marrying" [...] Aravan in the festival, to please the deity.|$|E

2500|$|On September 16, 2010, the Allegheny County Sports and Exhibition Authority voted {{unanimously}} to demolish the Civic Arena. SEA Board chairman, State Senator Wayne Fontana, DBrookline, said the board's decision will not be final unless someone comes forward with a better idea {{on the use of}} the Arena. During the summer of 2010, workers removed asbestos from the building while a demolition plan was designed. The board also decided to sell assets (handled by the auction company Asset Auctions) from inside and would later award a demolition contract in February 2011. Proponents for retaining the building <b>have</b> <b>vowed</b> <b>to</b> fight the demolition decision in court, and continue to seek landmark status. On November 24, 2010, the building's demolition was delayed due to a last-minute nomination as a National Historic Landmark. Also, on January 5, 2011, the Pittsburgh Historic Review Commission voted 5–1 in favor for preliminary approval of the arena's historic nomination status. The vote paved the way for a formal hearing on the proposed designation on March 2. The HRC ultimately voted against landmark status on March 2. After also failing to get historic status approval from City Planning and City Council, Preservation Pittsburgh filed a federal lawsuit in another attempt to save the arena. The 3rd appeals court denied the lawsuit saying it had no jurisdiction in the matter, and demolition began Monday, September 26, 2011. The demolition is not a traditional type of demolition for sports arenas. In November 2011, the Penguins started selling Christmas ornaments crafted from the Civic Arena's steel roof. The team used the promotion to raise money for its charitable foundation. Grove City-based Wendell August Forge, the oldest and largest forge in the United States, created two types of ornaments: one with the arena and the Pittsburgh skyline and another with the arena with the Penguins' logo. The Penguins had originally planned to sell 6,000 ornaments, but due to demand, the team ended selling over 40,000 pieces. The arena was being disassembled over time, and originally expected to be complete in May 2012. However, demolition was finished early as the last panel of the retractable roof fell down on March 31, 2012. A timelapse video on YouTube breaks down 9 months of Civic Arena demolition work in just 31 seconds. It is called [...] "THE DISAPPEARING CIVIC ARENA".|$|E
