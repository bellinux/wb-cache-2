40|$|Abstract: In Chapter 4 of his "Self-Deception Unmasked" (SDU), Al Mele {{considers}} several (attempted) <b>empirical</b> <b>demonstrations</b> of self-deception. These <b>empirical</b> <b>demonstrations</b> {{work under}} the conception of what Mele {{refers to as the}} 'dual-belief requirement', in which an agent simultaneously holds a belief p and a belief ~p. Toward the end of this chapter, Mele considers the argument of one biologist and anthropologist, Robert Trivers, who describes what he takes to be an evolutionary explanation for coming to form false beliefs. Mele argues briefly that Trivers's account is no more explanatory than a similar one that does not include the dual-belief requirement. I present a case describing Trivers' analysis, show how Mele might reply to it. After briefly explaining Mele's sufficient conditions for entering self-deception from Chapter 3 of SDU, I'll consider what it means to hold the dual-belief. I'll then consider what I take to be a class of cases of self-deception which rely on genetic determinism, which I take to satisfy the dual-belief condition...|$|R
40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright Masson S. p. A. Category-specific {{disorders}} are perhaps the archetypal example of domain-specificity ??? being typically defined {{by the presence of}} dissociations between living and nonliving naming ability in people following neurological damage. The methods adopted to quantify naming across categories are therefore pivotal since they provide the criterion for defining whether patients have a category effect and necessarily influence the subsequent direction and the interpretation of testing. This paper highlights a series of methodological concerns relating to how we measure and define category (or any) dissociations. These include the common failure to include control data or the use of control data that is inappropriate e. g. at ceiling, unmatched. A review of past cases shows that the overwhelming majority suffers from these problems and therefore challenges conclusions about the purported <b>empirical</b> <b>demonstrations</b> of dissociations and double dissociations in the category specific literature. This is not a refutation of category deficits, but skepticism about the current existence of any convincing <b>empirical</b> <b>demonstrations</b> of category specific double dissociations. As a potential solution, certain minimal criteria are proposed that might aid with the attempt to document category effects that are more methodologically convincing...|$|R

5000|$|Gaventa's {{articulation}} and <b>empirical</b> <b>demonstration</b> of the [...] "three-dimensional" [...] {{approach to}} the study of power has informed many disciplines and scholars about the nuances of social power and the processes of its legitimization, while also lending support to scholars and social change advocates who would find the sources and the solutions of social problems not in the dictates or preconceived notions held by social scientists, theologians, and philosophers, but in the narratives of the affected alienated populations. In Gaventa's theory, such methodological subjectivity allows the framing of a social problem, and a social solution, to arise from within the group, thereby empowering and better enabling the group to take collective action in the face of authorities' power to frame issues as non-issues in the public's mind.|$|E

He had a longstanding interest in musical vibrations, and a decade earlier in 1666 had even boasted to Samuel Pepys that he could tell the rate a fly's wings were beating from the sound they made. In July 1681, he demonstrated to the Royal Society his new device for producing distinct musical tones by striking the teeth of fast-turning brass wheels. In this way, he was able to generate for the first time sound waves of known frequency, and provide an <b>empirical</b> <b>demonstration</b> of the correspondence between the human perception of pitch and the physical property of sound-wave frequency. Furthermore, by fitting different wheels alongside one another on the same axis, he was able to verify frequency ratios for musical intervals, such as perfect fifths and fourths, etc.|$|E

The paper {{focuses on}} the task of {{generating}} the first m best solutions for a combinatorial optimization problem defined over a graphical model (e. g., the m most probable explanations for a Bayesian network).
