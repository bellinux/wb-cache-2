Catastrophe bond (CAT bond) {{is one of}} {{the most}} active {{instruments}} to transfer catastrophic risk into the capital market around the whole world. And the pricing theories are developed recently. For earthquake disaster, a pricing model, base on engineering seismic risk assessment, is given. The occurring probability of a defined earthquake catastrophe, estimated by seismic risk assessment method, is adopted as an input. Some factors, like yields and proportion of reinvestment, principal protected ratio, <b>issuance</b> <b>fee,</b> circulation, maturity period, claim payments of insurers and reinsurers, are designed. The cash flows of earthquake insurance premium in complete and incomplete markets are described by Geometric Brownian Motion and Jump-Diffusion processes respectively. The annual coupon rate of a CAT bond is calculated under the equilibrium between the incomes of investors and issuers. The feasibility of the model is represented by a production...|$|E
40|$|The Indiana House Enrolled Act 1481 (HEA- 1481) {{requires}} that the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) adopt final rules by December 31, 2014, for the <b>issuance,</b> <b>fee</b> structure and enforcement of permits for overweight divisible loads, fee structure of permits for loads on extra heavy duty highways, and fee structure of permits for overweight loads. On December 26, 2013, INDOT adopted the Emergency Rules regarding these items, as required by HEA- 1481, effective January 1, 2014. HEA- 1481 requires INDOT to use {{the results of this}} impact study to inform the setting of final rules. Three different fee structures were considered: Pre-HEA- 1481 fee structures were in place prior to HEA- 1481; Interim Policy fee structures were in place between June 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013; these were superseded by Emergency Rules which took effect January 1, 2014. INDOT commissioned this study to evaluate the impacts of overweight divisible load permits on revenue, asset consumption, alternative transportation modes, Indiana’s economic development, and economic competitiveness relative to other Midwestern states. The results of the analysis indicate that overall, the overweight commodities divisible permit structure arising from HEA- 1481 is not expected to change dramatically the consumption of pavement and bridge assets, lead to a slight increase in the revenue collected per permit and a slight decrease in the gap between consumption and revenue. However, the gap between revenue and consumption is still significant. From an operations standpoint, it was estimated that HEA- 141 will lead to a net decrease in safety but a net increase in mobility of the traffic stream, due to the twin but opposing effects of traffic impairment and trip substitution associated with overweight vehicle operations. Also, HEA- 1481 is expected to lead to little or no shift in the modal share across truck and rail, but significant shift in the specific configurations of vehicles used in trucking operations. The Act is expected to increase the economic competitiveness of trucking operations Indiana, compared to the pre-HEA 1481 situation. Finally, the Act is expected to increase economic development at least in the long term by reducing the cost of transportation, an essential expenditure item of most major businesses in Indiana. Overall, HEA- 1481 is expected to protect the highway bridge and pavement infrastructure by providing incentives for less-damaging loading behavior, reduce the gap between revenue and consumption, generally have slightly adverse net impacts on safety and slightly beneficial impacts of mobility, increase the economic competitiveness of trucking operations relative to other states, and provide grounds for increased economic development...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the cash holdings of publicly unlisted {{real estate investment}} trusts (REITs). Unlisted REITs have an organizational structure characterized by high equity <b>issuance</b> <b>fees,</b> weak governance mechanisms, finite life and distinctive periods during which there is access to public equity. All of these features have important implications for their corporate liquidity management. Using quarterly data from a sample of U. S. equity REITs spanning 1991 to 2013, the evidence provided in this dissertation reveals that unlisted REITs save a significant portion of equity offering proceeds to increase cash holdings and that these cash reserves are consistent with the precautionary motive for cash holdings. Specifically, it is estimated that for each additional dollar of new equity raised, 25 cents is accumulated as cash. The estimated amount of withholding for cash reserves is similar in magnitude even after empirically controlling for other sources of liquidity such as leverage, FFO and bank credit lines. Comparing unlisted REITs to each other, cash holdings are significantly higher during periods of equity access than when the offering period has expired. In fact, unlisted REITs with equity access hold cash balances that are 43 % higher (relative to total assets) than cash balances after the offering period has closed. This finding is explained {{by the nature of the}} offering period for unlisted REITs wherein opportunities for cash accumulation are greater due to ongoing equity access and since FFO is less predictable during early stage operations. Further analysis reveals that early-stage cash accumulations are subsequently used to support investment activity. Extending the comparison to include a sample of propensity score-matched listed REITs reveals that unlisted REITs, on average, hoard between 9 % to 22 % more cash (depending on post-offering vs. equity access) than their exchange-listed counterparts. Utilization of bank credit lines by unlisted REITs is 28 % lower than utilization by listed REITs. The difference in cash holdings and credit line utilization between listed and unlisted REITs is related to lower quality corporate governance mechanisms and the lack of operational transparency at unlisted REITs. Findings from this research should be useful to academics, policy-makers and investors who seek to understand the dynamics of liquidity management in firms that raise capital under finite-life organizational structure yet function as asset management intermediaries. Overall, the results imply that the increased operational risk in the unlisted REIT sector makes them more inclined to hold excess liquidity reserves, which consist primarily of cash. Cash provides unlisted REITs with self-managed insurance against liquidity shocks and offers greater financial flexibility when compared to banker-managed credit lines. In theory, unlisted REITs can also rely on internally-generated future cash flow to fund liquidity needs but its anticipated flow is rather unpredictable for an early-stage “blind pool” fund...|$|R
