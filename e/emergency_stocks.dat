40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} a methodological framework for designing and evaluating an <b>emergency</b> <b>stock</b> system aimed at supplying {{the needs of}} the population in the event that an emergency situation (drought, war, embargo) will not allow the regular flow of supply. The functioning of the <b>emergency</b> <b>stock</b> system is described as a stochastic process, assumed to be a Markov process and the stock size and storage rules are the control variables. The main performance criterion is the costs of attaining a certain level of reliability which is deemed necessary by the policy maker, where the system's reliability is defined as the probability that in all possible emergency situations, the amount in storage will suffice to meet the demand...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the (S- 1,S) inventory policy under stuttering Poisson demand and exponentially-distributed lead times when demand {{in excess of}} on-hand inventory is routed to an emergency order fulfillment system. This system contains a regional stocking location (RSL), which serves two types of facilities: a set of field service locations (FSL) and an <b>emergency</b> <b>stocking</b> location (ESL). The field service locations support technical service representatives who make visits to customer sites to repair equipment. We derive both exact and approximate expressions for the mean and variance {{of the number of}} units in emergency resupply. We also estimate the probability of zero units in emergency resupply. Simulation results confirm the quality of these approximations. Later, we use a distribution with an atom at zero and a zero-truncated negative binomial distribution to approximate the shape of this distribution. The quantiles are shown to be well approximated in simulations with various settings. In particular, the approximation is excellent in the upper tail which is the portion of the distribution used to determine the target inventory level for the <b>emergency</b> <b>stocking</b> location. Finally, we develop an optimization algorithm for setting stock levels in such a system with both field service locations and an <b>emergency</b> <b>stocking</b> location. The problem is an integer programming problem with a potential non-convex objective and we explore a heuristic algorithm for solving the optimization problem. For empirical studies, we compare the results of our heuristics with PSWARM, a general purpose algorithm for such problems...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} recent natural {{disasters}} (earthquakes, floods, droughts) and man-made crises (civil unrest, war, political disturbance) have highlighted {{the vulnerability of}} communities to unstable conditions. Reaching displaced people in crisis conditions is heavily dependent {{on the effectiveness of}} the supply chain and its management systems. Disaster responses have been modelled into, for example, three stages: preparedness, response, and recovery (Carter, 1999). In the case of the Asian tsunami, one of the principal weaknesses was the absence of such events from existing government response plans. There was therefore no top-down strategy and no implementation mechanism on the ground. Whatever communications networks were in place were quickly overwhelmed; they therefore became the subject of a major review in the months following the disaster. This paper highlights the fact that disaster preparedness in the manner suggested by Carter (1999) is shown to be less appropriate than the 'soft approach' taken by the Thai Government post-tsunami, whereby emphasis is on well-organised local communication networks, early warning systems, and danger mitigation rather than accumulation and management of large scale <b>emergency</b> <b>stocks</b> of, for example, food, tents, and equipment...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates how {{organization}} should {{design their}} supply chains (SCs) and use risk mitigation strategies to meet different performance objectives. To do this, we develop two mixed integer nonlinear (MINL) lean and responsive models for a four-tier SC {{to understand these}} four strategies: i) holding back-up <b>emergency</b> <b>stocks</b> at the DCs, ii) holding back-up emergency stock for transshipment to all DCs at a strategic DC (for risk pooling in the SC), iii) reserving excess capacity in the facilities, and iv) using other facilities in the SC’s network to back-up the primary facilities. A new method for designing the network is developed which works based on the definition of path to cover all possible disturbances. To solve the two proposed MINL models, a linear regression approximation is suggested to linearize the models; this technique works based on a piecewise linear transformation. The efficiency of the solution technique is tested for two prevalent distribution functions. We then explore how these models operate using empirical data from an automotive SC. This enables us to develop a more comprehensive risk mitigation framework than previous studies and show {{how it can be}} used to determine the optimal SC design and risk mitigation strategies given the uncertainties faced by practitioners and the performance objectives they wish to meet...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} food {{security}} applies in both poor and rich societies and concerns the steady availability {{of food in}} the right quantity and quality, at the right price. Globally, policies to assure it remain confused and world food prices are rising. Despite large exports of fish, Iceland produces only around half of its inhabitants’ nutritional needs and relies significantly on imports, also for food production inputs like fodder and seeds. Icelandic supplies are affected by oligopoly in the retail market, and could be put at risk by events in other security dimensions ranging from natural disasters and infrastructure failures to terrorism, neighbouring conflicts and other people’s shortages. Icelandic farmers have used the terminology of ‘food security’ to press their claims for more home-grown production, and more recently also in their campaign against EU membership. The general public however shows little sign of security-awareness in this field. The government possesses suitable non-military security frameworks to address food-related risks and has initiated useful, general and specific, studies. Yet it has not developed a strategy or contingency plan for food security, even following {{the lessons of the}} 2008 economic crash and 2010 - 2011 eruptions. Suitable remedies would include larger <b>emergency</b> <b>stocks</b> and a range of measures to reduce vulnerability and improve resilience in crises. Above all, Iceland needs a balanced and open policy-making process to decide what its general future strategy should be as a food-producing and -importing nation.

40|$|We {{consider}} a network in which field stocking locations (FSLs) manage multiple parts {{according to an}} (S- 1,S) policy. Demand processes for the parts {{are assumed to be}} independent stuttering Poisson processes. Regular replenishments to an FSL occur from a regional stocking location (RSL) that has an unlimited supply of each part type. Demand in excess of supply at an FSL is routed to an <b>emergency</b> <b>stocking</b> location (ESL), which also employs an (S- 1,S) policy to manage its inventory. Demand in excess of supply at the ESL is backordered. Lead time from the ESL to each FSL is assumed to be negligible compared to the RSL-ESL resupply time. In companion papers we have shown how to approximate the joint probability distributions of units on hand, units in regular resupply, and units in emergency resupply. In this paper, we focus on the problem of determining the stock levels at the FSLs and ESL across all part numbers that minimize backorder, and emergency resupply costs subject to an inventory investment budget constraint.

Shorter disruption of imports of fuel and crude oil can be managed with an <b>emergency</b> <b>stock,</b> but a prolonged halt in imports creates problems. For industry, the vulnerability is greater. Fragmented production chains in combination with expenditure reductions in inventory causes a dependency on proper transport of intermediate goods in the manufacturing industry.

40|$|From 1992 to 2012 4. 4 {{billion people}} were {{affected}} by disasters with almost 2 trillion USD in damages and 1. 3 million people killed worldwide. The increasing threat of disasters stresses {{the need to provide}} solutions for the challenges faced by disaster managers, such as the logistical deployment of resources required to provide relief to victims. The location of <b>emergency</b> facilities, <b>stock</b> prepositioning, evacuation, inventory management, resource allocation, and relief distribution have been identified to directly impact the relief provided to victims during the disaster. Managing appropriately these factors is critical to reduce suffering. Disaster management commonly attracts several organisations working alongside each other and sharing resources to cope with the emergency. Coordinating these agencies is a complex task but there is little research considering multiple organisations, and none actually optimising the number of actors required to avoid shortages and convergence. The aim of the this research is to develop a system for disaster management based on a combination of optimisation techniques and geographical information systems (GIS) to aid multi-organisational decision-making. An integrated decision system was created comprising a cartographic model implemented in GIS to discard floodable facilities, combined with two models focused on optimising the decisions regarding location of <b>emergency</b> facilities, <b>stock</b> prepositioning, the allocation of resources and relief distribution, along with the number of actors required to perform these activities. Three in-depth case studies in Mexico were studied gathering information from different organisations. The cartographic model proved to reduce the risk to select unsuitable facilities. The preparedness and response models showed the capacity to optimise the decisions and the number of organisations required for logistical activities, pointing towards an excess of actors involved in all cases. The system as a whole demonstrated its capacity to provide integrated support for disaster preparedness and response, along with the existence of room for improvement for Mexican organisations in flood management...|$|R
