50|$|The expedition's discoveries and {{experiences}} {{made a significant}} contribution to polar science, especially the discovery of the Northeast passage by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld. They also gave an impetus to <b>International</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Years,</b> meaning a shift from sports-like races of single expeditions to worldwide scientific cooperation in exploring the polar regions.|$|R
50|$|The <b>International</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Years</b> (IPY) are collaborative, {{international}} efforts with intensive research foci on the polar regions. Karl Weyprecht, an Austro-Hungarian naval officer, motivated the endeavor in 1875, but died before it first occurred in 1882-1883. Fifty years later (1932-1933) a second IPY took place. The International Geophysical Year {{was inspired by}} the IPY and was organized 75 years after the first IPY (1957-58). The fourth, and most recent, IPY covered two full annual cycles from March 2007 to March 2009.|$|R
25|$|In 1882–1883, a German {{expedition}} for the First <b>International</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Year</b> {{was stationed}} at Royal Bay on the southeast {{side of the}} island. The scientists of this group observed the transit of Venus and recorded waves produced by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa.|$|E
25|$|On March 1, 2007, while {{launching}} the <b>International</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Year</b> that a worldwide {{program that will}} focus on intense researches on the Arctic regions, including climate change effects, the government announced a $150 million/4 year funding for over 40 projects related to the IPY program.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>International</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Year</b> 1882-1883 the Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition stayed {{one year}} at Jan Mayen. The {{expedition}} performed extensive mapping of the area, their maps being of such quality {{that they were}} used until the 1950s. The Austrian polar station on Jan Mayen Island was built and equipped in 1882 fully at Count Wilczek's own expense.|$|E
50|$|Wescott {{worked at}} the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks from 1958 to 2009, through two <b>International</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Years.</b> He was {{appointed}} Professor Emeritus of Geophysics, and had an extensive background of research in solid earth geophysics and space physics. He was involved directly in auroral and magnetospheric electric field studies and plasma physics experiments using barium and calcium plasma rocket injections at Poker Flat Research Range. He and Drs. David Sentman and Daniel Osborne proved the existence of red sprites and blue jets, upper-atmospheric electrical phenomena.|$|R
50|$|The International Geophysical Year traces {{its origins}} to the <b>International</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Years,</b> {{which had been}} held in 1882-1883 and 1932-1933 (and would be held again in 2007-2009). In March 1950, several top {{scientists}} (including Lloyd Berkner, Sydney Chapman, S. Fred Singer, and Harry Vestine), met in James Van Allen's living room and suggested that the time was ripe to have a worldwide Geophysical Year instead of a <b>Polar</b> <b>Year,</b> especially considering recent advances in rocketry, radar, and computing. Following the March 1950 meeting, Berkner and Chapman proposed to the International Council of Scientific Unions that an International Geophysical Year (IGY) be planned for 1957-58, coinciding with an approaching period of maximum solar activity.|$|R
40|$|In 1957 {{a program}} of {{international}} research, inspired by the <b>International</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Years</b> of 1882 - 83 and 1932 - 33, was organized as the International Geophysical Year (IGY) to study global phenomena of the Earth and geospace. The IGY involved about 60, 000 scientists from 66 nations, working at thousands of stations, from pole to pole to obtain simultaneous, global observations on Earth and in space. There had never been anything like it before. The fiftieth anniversary of the International Geophysical Year will occur in 2007. We propose to organize an international program of scientific collaboration for this time period called the International Heliophysical Year (IHY). Like it predecessors, the IHY will focus on fundamental global questions of Earth science...|$|R

40|$|The {{first three}} <b>International</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Years</b> (IPYs; 1882 – 1883, 1932 – 1933, 1957 – 1958) were major periods of intense {{multidisciplinary}} polar research, bringing significant {{new insights into}} global processes and laying the foundation of knowledge of the polar regions for future decades. The fourth IPY (2007 – 2009) continues the tradition of international science years {{and is one of}} the most ambitious internationally coordinated scientific research programmes ever attempted. In contrast to the three previous IPYs, the new IPY incorporates research within social science and its interface with the natural sciences. The new IPY also includes a wide range of education and outreach activities, and a commitment to excite and train the next generation of polar researchers. We discuss briefly the history of the IPYs, and their contribution to comprehending Antarctic Climate Evolution...|$|R

40|$|Invasive {{alien species}} {{are among the}} primary causes of {{biodiversity}} change globally, with the risks thereof broadly understood for most regions of the world. They are similarly thought {{to be among the}} most significant conservation threats to Antarctica, especially as climate change proceeds in the region. However, no comprehensive, continent-wide evaluation of the risks to Antarctica posed by such species has been undertaken. Here we do so by sampling, identifying, and mapping the vascular plant propagules carried by all categories of visitors to Antarctica during the <b>International</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Year's</b> first season (2007 - 2008) and assessing propagule establishment likelihood based on their identity and origins and on spatial variation in Antarctica's climate. For an evaluation of the situation in 2100, we use modeled climates based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Special Report on Emissions Scenarios Scenario A 1 B [Nakicenovic N, Swart R, eds (2000) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios: A Special Report of Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK) ]. Visitors carrying seeds average 9. 5 seeds per person, although as vectors, scientists carry greater propagule loads than tourists. Annual tourist numbers (~ 33, 054) are higher than those of scientists (~ 7, 085), thus tempering these differences in propagule load. Alien species establishment is currently most likely for the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Recent founder populations of several alien species in this area corroborate these findings. With climate change, risks will grow in the Antarctic Peninsula, Ross Sea, and East Antarctic coastal regions. Our evidence-based assessment demonstrates which parts of Antarctica are at growing risk from alien species that may become invasive and provides the means to mitigate this threat now and into the future as the continent's climate changes...|$|R
25|$|The expedition, {{part of the}} Russian {{program for}} the 20072008 <b>International</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Year,</b> used the Akademik Fedorov {{research}} ship, with both MIR submersibles on board and the nuclear icebreaker Rossiya (Russia) led it through the Arctic ice.

25|$|Soviet {{activities}} grew rapidly {{following the}} <b>International</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Year</b> in 1932.

A geological and glaciological expedition {{was carried out in}} the 1934–35 season while over one hundred hours of cartographic flights were flown in 1935 to make corrections to the maps. Two more icebreakers, Sadko and Taymyr, explored the islands that year. From 1934 to 1936 sixty people stayed the winter at Tikhay Bay, where the first person was born on the archipelago.|$|E
