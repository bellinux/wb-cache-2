5|$|A paper <b>documenting</b> <b>the</b> {{discovery}} was {{prepared by the}} team {{and sent to the}} journal Physical Review in March 1941, but publication was delayed until a year after the end of World War II due to security concerns. At the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product. They calculated that element 94 would be fissile, and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium, and could easily be separated from it.|$|E

Despite this agenda, Ottoi was not employed as a political panelist, but, as a practicing physician, held Searas advice column.|$|E
5|$|Benefits Street is a British {{documentary}} series broadcast on Channel 4. It was first aired on 6 January 2014, {{and ran for}} five episodes. The show was filmed by <b>documenting</b> <b>the</b> lives of several residents of James Turner Street, Winson Green, Birmingham, England, United Kingdom, where newspapers including the Daily Mail and The Guardian reported that 90% of the residents claim benefits.

40|$|There {{has been}} a great {{increase}} in the amount of <b>the</b> <b>document</b> production since <b>the</b> 1900 ?s {{with the help of the}} institutionalization and the heavy usage of the computers at the institutions as a result of the industrialization. <b>The</b> increasing <b>document</b> production necessitated <b>the</b> institutions to control their produced <b>documents,</b> to prevent <b>the</b> production of unnecessary documents and to produce well-qualified <b>documents.</b> <b>The</b> mentioned necessities are the most important factors that create <b>the</b> <b>document</b> management. Document management is a management operation that contains the management of the entire period which starts with the production of <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> and ends with the transfer of <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> to <b>the</b> archives. The institutions and the organizations have to produce <b>the</b> <b>documents,</b> to receive <b>the</b> <b>documents,</b> to store <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> that prove <b>the</b> institutions and the organizations had completed those transactions and to reuse <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> in order to continue their activities, to run the management and to execute legal obligations. In the current era when the production and the usage of <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> reach to an amazing size, it can easily be seen that the importance and the usage of the archives are tremendously increased as parallel to the increase in the number of the data and <b>the</b> <b>documents.</b> <b>The</b> purpose of this paper is to study <b>the</b> correspondence, filing, <b>document</b> and archive operations according to the principles and policies of <b>the</b> <b>document</b> and archive managements.

5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} digital {{evidence}} {{are concerned with}} two issues: integrity and authenticity.

Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The ease with which digital media can be modified means that <b>documenting</b> <b>the</b> chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.|$|E
