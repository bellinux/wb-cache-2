60|$|I {{have told}} you what I thought was {{intended}} by the first rehearsal of them, namely, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> how Antichrist got in with his sensuality, and opposed it to the true light of the Word of God, exalting himself above God, and also above all Divine revelation; this was his light against light. But, I say, why is it repeated? For he saith, 'Light was against light in three ranks' again. Truly, I think it is repeated <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the evil effects the first antichristian opposition would have in the church of God, {{towards the end of}} her wilderness state. For, 'light against light' now, for that it is <b>here</b> repeated, is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>us</b> some new thing, or, as far as wood and windows can speak, to let us understand what would be the consequence of those antichristian figments[11] that were brought into the church at first by him.|$|R
