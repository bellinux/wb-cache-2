5|$|Combat {{missions}} {{were flown}} by the 509th Composite Group on 20, 23, 26 and 29 July and 8 and 14 August 1945, using the bombs against individual targets in Japanese cities. A total of 49 bombs were dropped on 14 targets, one bomb was jettisoned <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> {{and two were}} aboard aircraft that aborted their missions.|$|E
5|$|Pyroclastic {{flows from}} an {{eruption}} would destroy much wildlife about the volcano. Gareloi has historically produced several pyroclastic flows, which can travel extremely fast. Future flows at Gareloi Volcano could travel {{off the island}} into the Pacific Ocean and, if large enough, could fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> and generate tsunamis, though unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the {{peninsula}} makes accurate weather prediction difficult for the town; when driving down Melody Line, {{it is not uncommon}} to find it sunny between one set of tunnels, rainy between another, and foggy between yet another. Ikata's position, stretching out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> also makes it a frequent target for typhoons.|$|E
2500|$|... a {{physical}} exchange between {{the atmosphere and}} the other compartments of the planet. An example is the mixing of atmospheric gases <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{rivers of}} the province are the Berg and Olifants which drain <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic <b>Ocean,</b> and <b>the</b> Breede and Gourits which drain <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Indian <b>Ocean.</b>|$|R
25|$|Other rivers flow either {{directly}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Pacific <b>Ocean</b> or {{directly or indirectly}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Arctic <b>Ocean.</b> <b>The</b> Alsek-Tatshenshini drainage flows directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Pacific from southwestern Yukon. A number of rivers in northern Yukon flow directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Arctic <b>Ocean.</b> <b>The</b> two main Yukon rivers flowing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Mackenzie River in the Northwest Territories are the Liard River in the southeast and the Peel River and its tributaries in the northeast.|$|R
5|$|The {{northwest}} corner of the peninsula, where the San Diego River flows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> is a separate community known as Ocean Beach. The southern one-third of the Point Loma Peninsula is entirely federal land, including Naval Base Point Loma, Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery, and Cabrillo National Monument.|$|E
5|$|After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose {{return to}} the boat deck. The {{lifeboats}} have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> and he helps her onto a wooden panel only buoyant enough for one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of hypothermia but Rose is saved.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{remained}} far from land, the waves triggered by Liza {{were able to}} reach California, where they combined with high tide, threatening beachfront homes that had weakened foundations after a previous tide. The hurricane was responsible for sweeping hundreds of Labor Day swimmers out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> in Zuma Beach and Newport Beach, {{all of whom were}} saved by lifeguards. The waves also tore off a group of sundecks estimated at $5,000(1968USD) near Laguna Beach.|$|E
5000|$|The {{biogeochemical}} boundary in {{the original}} framework has two parts: a) anthropogenic nitrogen removed from the atmosphere and b) anthropogenic phosphorus going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b> Lynas focuses on the nitrogen cycle.|$|R
25|$|Another base is {{also being}} {{constructed}} on Pulau Langkawi, Kedah to provide the RMN with readier access <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Indian <b>Ocean.</b> Ready access <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Pacific <b>Ocean</b> is available via the existing base at Semporna, Sabah.|$|R
30|$|The {{adoption}} of new guidelines on environmental sound management of plastic and plastic containing wastes, {{with a view}} to minimize the possibility of plastic leaks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> coming from waste management.|$|R
5|$|Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} first attempt at {{studying}} sea animals in their native environment by descending <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> in a diving helmet. Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Gal√°pagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals. In addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same method of research that he had pioneered in the tropics to a small area of ocean, sailing in circles around it for ten days {{with the intention of}} documenting all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{is invited}} to the White House for lunch with the President. However, Goldfinger hijacks the plane {{carrying}} Bond there. In a struggle for Goldfinger's revolver, the gun fires, shooting out a window, creating an explosive decompression. Goldfinger is blown out of the cabin through the ruptured window. With the plane out of control, Bond rescues Galore and they parachute safely from the aircraft before it crashes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gru finds Lucy {{strapped}} to a TNT-loaded shark rocket and starts to untie her, but Pollito launches the rocket, sending it flying towards the same volcano where Macho previously faked his death. Lucy accepts Gru's invitation for a date, and the pair dive <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> seconds before the rocket enters the volcano and violently explodes. After a comical 147 dates, Gru and Lucy get married, and Margo, Edith and Agnes finally have someone close to a mother.|$|E
50|$|Antarctic Intermediate Water {{flows from}} Antarctica <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Indian <b>Ocean</b> {{from where it}} reaches Africa from the east. It flows south through the Agulhas Passage and then follows the Agulhas Current and retroflects back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Indian <b>Ocean.</b>|$|R
25|$|Even {{in areas}} where the bottom {{sediment}}s are ancient, bottom trawling, by reintroducing <b>the</b> sediment <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water column, can create harmful algae blooms. More suspended solids are introduced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> from bottom trawling than any other man-made source.|$|R
50|$|The Witwatersrand plateau forms a {{continental}} divide with the run-off to <b>the</b> north draining <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Indian <b>Ocean</b> via <b>the</b> Crocodile and Limpopo Rivers, while the run-off {{to the south}} drains via <b>the</b> Vaal <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Orange River and ultimately <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic <b>Ocean.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hitler {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of the fortifications in 1942. Almost a million French workers were drafted to build it. The wall was frequently mentioned in Nazi propaganda, where its size and strength were usually exaggerated. The fortifications included colossal coastal guns, batteries, mortars, and artillery, and thousands of German troops were stationed in its defences. When the Allies eventually invaded the Normandy beaches in 1944, most of the defences were stormed within hours. Today, ruins of the wall exist in all of the nations where it was built, although many structures have fallen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> or have been demolished over the years.|$|E
5|$|In 2065, the Zero-X {{spacecraft}} launches from Glenn Field as {{the first}} attempt at a manned mission to Mars. Unknown to Captain Paul Travers and his crew of two astronauts and two scientists, criminal mastermind the Hood has infiltrated the ship to photograph Zero-Xs wing mechanism. When his foot becomes trapped in the hydraulics, the Hood causes a systems failure and Zero-X loses control. While the villain manages to extract his bloodied foot and parachute from the undercarriage, Travers and his crew eject in an escape pod and Zero-X crashes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> before leaving Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|In its daily {{tropical}} weather outlook, the India Meteorological Department warned fishermen on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to not go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> due to {{the anticipated}} rough seas. Upon approaching the coast of Bangladesh, officials canceled all flights {{to and from the}} Shah Amanat International Airport. Additionally, authorities at the port of Chittagong worked to protect cargo ships from the storm, and it was ultimately closed for a period of 19hours. In preparation for Akash, officials advised coastal residents to evacuate further inland; about 80,000 total residents left for emergency shelters. About 40,000 Red Cross volunteers were prepared to aid those potentially affected.|$|E
50|$|South of Cape Agulhas {{the warm}} Agulhas Current that flows {{south along the}} east coast of Africa retroflects back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Indian <b>Ocean.</b> While retroflecting, it pinches off large ocean eddies (Agulhas rings) that drift <b>into</b> <b>the</b> South Atlantic <b>Ocean</b> and take {{enormous}} amounts of heat and salt <b>into</b> <b>the</b> neighbouring <b>ocean.</b> This mechanism constitutes one of the key elements in the global conveyor belt circulation of heat and salt.|$|R
50|$|The litter that {{is being}} {{delivered}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> is toxic to marine life, and humans. The toxins that are components of plastic include diethylhexyl phthalate, which is a toxic carcinogen, as well as lead, cadmium, and mercury.|$|R
50|$|Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) {{originates}} at {{the water}} surface around Antarctica and flows northward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Indian <b>Ocean.</b> At 1500 m, it then flows westward along the African east-coast and the Agulhas Bank before retroflecting eastward across <b>the</b> Agulhas Plateau <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Indian <b>Ocean.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, nearby nuclear weapons testing by the United States {{military}} accidentally caused {{all of the}} islands of Hy-yi-yi to sink <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> destroying all traces of the rhinogrades and their unique ecosystem. Also killed were all the world's Rhinogradentia researchers, who were attending a conference on Hy-yi-yi at the time. The book's epilogue, credited to Steiner {{in his capacity as}} the book's illustrator, explains that St√ºmpke had sent the book's materials to Steiner to {{serve as the basis for}} illustrations in preparation for publication. Following the disaster, it is the only remaining record of the subjects it describes.|$|E
5|$|Kohala's native Hawaiian {{rain forest}} has {{a thick layer}} of ferns and mosses {{carpeting}} the floor, which act as sponges, absorbing water from rain and passing much of it through to the groundwater in aquifers below; when feral animals like pigs trample the covering, the forest loses its ability to hold in water effectively, and instead of recharging the aquifer, it results in a severe loss of topsoil, much of which ends up being dumped by streams <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nearly 24,000 {{metric tons}} of plastic are dumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> each year. Turtles ingest {{a wide array of}} this {{floating}} debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, balloons and abandoned fishing line. Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns, including intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption and malnutrition, suffocation, ulcerations, or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage, or deviation from natural behaviors.|$|E
25|$|This may {{indicate}} {{a buildup of}} {{carbon dioxide in the}} atmosphere, some of which would dissolve <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> to form carbonic acid. Although the boron variations may be evidence of extreme climate change, they need not imply a global glaciation.|$|R
50|$|Carbon dioxide is also {{introduced}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> through hydrothermal vents. The Champagne hydrothermal vent, {{found at the}} Northwest Eifuku volcano at Marianas Trench Marine National Monument, produces almost pure liquid carbon dioxide, {{one of only two}} known sites in the world.|$|R

5|$|On July 21, 1961, Grissom was {{pilot of}} the second Project Mercury flight, Mercury-Redstone 4, which he named Liberty Bell 7. This was a sub-orbital flight that lasted 15 minutes and 37 seconds. After splashdown, {{emergency}} explosive bolts unexpectedly fired and blew the hatch off, causing water to flood into the spacecraft. Quickly exiting through the open hatch and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> Grissom nearly drowned as water began filling his spacesuit. A recovery helicopter tried to lift and retrieve the spacecraft, but the flooding spacecraft became too heavy, and it was ultimately cut loose before sinking.|$|E
5|$|SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward {{ride the}} wave {{and they see}} Mr. Krabs. He jumps up onto the board and drops Cashie <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> so Jack Kahuna Laguna goes to {{retrieve}} it and acts as the sacrifice. SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward are seen flying on the surfboard and approach Goo Lagoon. Sandy's helicopter crash-lands in Goo Lagoon. A welcome home party has been thrown for SpongeBob, and Jack Kahuna Laguna returns with Cashie, which he returns to Mr. Krabs.|$|E
5|$|Superman pursues Luthor, who {{has made}} his way to the growing land mass. The kryptonite shell {{surrounding}} the crystal has caused the new rock formations to be infused with kryptonite, making the land itself toxic to Superman. Luthor's thugs beat Superman into submission as he is unable to fight back. Luthor impales Superman with a kryptonite shard and allows him to fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> presumably to die.|$|E
50|$|The rivers {{crossing}} {{its territory}} belong {{both to the}} Pacific watershed and to the Amazon Basin. The Chira River {{is the most important}} and flows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Pacific <b>Ocean.</b> <b>The</b> Piura River also flows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Pacific <b>Ocean</b> although <b>the</b> flow varies greatly with the changing seasons and during severe droughts will dry up.|$|R
5000|$|Even after [...] {{emissions}} are lowered, the melting of ice sheets would continue, and further increase sea-level rise for centuries. Because of slow transport of heat <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> and <b>the</b> slow response time of ice sheets {{until the new}} system equilibrium has been reached.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{categorize}} and examine the inputs of pollution into our marine ecosystems. Patin (n.d.) notes that generally there are three main types of inputs of pollution <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ocean: direct discharge of waste <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans,</b> runoff <b>into</b> <b>the</b> waters due to rain, and pollutants released from the atmosphere.|$|R
