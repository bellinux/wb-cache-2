40|$|The device (1) has two springs (2) e. g. torsion springs, {{tensible}} or expandable along {{a spring}} axis, and curvedly sectionally extending around the spring axis. The springs include an active spring section (3), whose length is adjustable. The spring section extends between a force application point (6) and a bearing section (8) of the springs. The bearing section is guided in a spring bearing (4). The spring bearing is <b>displaceably</b> arranged along the springs for varying {{a position of}} the springs relative to the force application point. The spring has a round and/or rectangular cross-section...|$|E
40|$|NOVELTY - The {{arrangement}} has {{a holder}} (6) for rotatable attachment {{of a vehicle}} wheel (3) and for pivoting it into different camber angles. The tire on the wheel can be brought into rolling contact with the inner surface of a drum (11) arranged about the wheel and with a drive arrangement. A vertical or radial force and a lateral or axial force {{can be applied to}} the holder by vertical and lateral loading arrangements (9, 10) connected to the holder via linkages. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The drum's inner surface carries a startup ring adjacent to the try with an angled surface facing the try. The holder is <b>displaceably</b> mounted so that the wheel can pivot for automatic camber setting about the wheel contact point. The holder has a mounting (8 a) for at least one motor cycle wheel with single-sided attachment of the mounting to the remaining part of the holder. USE - For testing motor vehicle wheels or similar. ADVANTAGE - Enables working load conditions to be reproduced with reduced cost and time. The test results can be transferred to the practice of wheel manufacture relatively simply and reliably...|$|E
40|$|WO 2010130304 A 1 UPAB: 20101125 NOVELTY - The device has {{a bottom}} element (40) which covers a lower end (12) of the sleeve and is set {{apart from a}} sleeve (10). A {{circumferential}} gap (50) is formed between the bottom element and {{lower end of the}} sleeve. A plunger (30) is arranged in the sleeve to be <b>displaceably</b> movable and closes off the sleeve toward an upper end (14) such that space (60) is formed within the sleeve for receiving the tissue. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following: (1) method for separating fatty tissue hanging from piece of biological tissue; (2) method for isolation of fatty tissue from donor tissue of the human or animal body; (3) usage method of device; and (4) arrangement for automatic isolation of biological cells from human or animal donor tissue. USE - Device for separating fatty tissue from biological tissue of human or animal body (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The automated process is designed so as {{to be able to be}} operated in a good microbiological practice (GMP) compliant manner. The modularity of the individual automation steps allows high flexibility with respect to the tissue used and the desired application, including the possibility of carrying out individual processing steps...|$|E
40|$|DE 102008012384 A 1 UPAB: 20091001 NOVELTY - The cover (22) has a cover unit {{comprising}} a recess, {{which is}} partially limited by an optical window, where a quadratic surface roughness {{of the window}} is less than 25 nanometers. The window is <b>displaceably</b> and inclinedly arranged {{with respect to a}} cover base plane, where the cover consists of a glass e. g. silicate glass such as borosilicate glass, and a glass like material. A maximum expansion of the cover is largely equivalent to 150 millimeters, where the cover is provided with a functional surface structure and a refinement coating i. e. antistatic coating, which contains indium tin oxide. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for manufacturing optical components. USE - Cover for use in a semiconductor industry for encapsulation of a microsystem e. g. micro component such as micromirror i. e. movable micromirror (all claimed), acceleration sensor and rotation rate sensor, micromechanical system and microoptical system, on a wafer plane. ADVANTAGE - The cover ensures effective encapsulation of the microsystem in a time and cost saving manner. The utilization of the functional surface structure and the refinement coating improves the functionality of the optical components. The cover ensures sufficient space, movement freedom and less disturbing interference of transmitted radiation...|$|E
40|$|Background—Cocaine-associated {{vascular}} {{events are}} not completely explained by adrenergic stimulation. The {{purposes of this study}} were to investigate whether vasoconstrictive endothelin- 1 is released by cocaine and to elucidate the mechanisms involved. Methods and Results—Endothelin- 1 was measured by radioimmunoassay and high-performance liquid chromatography (1) in the supernatant of porcine aortic endothelial cells after treatment with cocaine (1027 to 1024 mol/L) and a s-receptor antagonist, haloperidol (1026 mol/L) or ditolylguanidine (1025 mol/L) and (2) in plasma and urine of 12 cocaine-intoxicated patients and 13 healthy control subjects. Radioligand binding assays were performed on endothelial membrane preparations. In cell culture, cocaine significantly increased endothelin accumulation above baseline at 3 to 24 hours; endothelin release rates per hour increased dose-dependently, reaching a plateau of 175623 % of control at hour 4 to 5. Coincubation of cocaine with haloperidol or ditolylguanidine abolished or reduced cocaine-induced endothelin release. Endothelial membrane preparations specifically and <b>displaceably</b> bound the highly selective s-ligand [3 H]ditolylguanidine (2531029 mol/L), with 1400 binding sites estimated per cell. Endothelin- 1 levels in plasma (22. 765. 6 versus 7. 360. 8 pmol/L) and urine (41. 5610. 1 versus 12. 763. 8 pmol/L) of cocaine-intoxicated patients were significantly increased compared with control values. Conclusions—The data suggest that cocaine increases the endothelin- 1 release in vitro and in vivo. The cocaine-induce...|$|E
