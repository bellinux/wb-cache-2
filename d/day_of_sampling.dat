The increasing of faecal coliforms in VC during the 20 th <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> could be attributed to creation of a good environment for multiplication of this pathogen through rehydration and subsequent availability of easily degradable substrates by dissolution following rehydration (Mupondi et al. 2010). The reports by Schönning and Stenström (2004) and WHO (2006) also indicated that certain types of pathogenic bacteria can increase in numbers when conditions favouring their growth are established in their storage medium/environment.|$|E

Turning the piled substrate in WC and the smaller size and increased surface area of the vermibed in VC and WVC might have resulted in increased loss of ammonia leading to a relatively low level of ammonium at this <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> (20 th day). The compost pile in PC, on the other hand, being not turned and mixed, the loss of N {{in the form of}} ammonia might have relatively been reduced and this might have contributed for the increased level of ammonium nitrogen in PC than the other methods of composting.

40|$|Hurlburt (2009) {{asserts that}} {{iterative}} training {{is an essential}} component of the Descriptive Experience Sampling (DES) method and that interviews of untrained participants are generally characterized by presuppositions about experience and miscommunication rather than pristine experience. Hurlburt and Heavey (2015) further assert that other experience sampling methods (e. g., the Experience Sampling Method) are inadequate due to the minimal training provided in those paradigms. In Study 1, we sought to determine whether DES interviewees decrease in density of subjunctification (i. e., behavioral and verbal indicators that an interviewee is not providing a straightforward account of inner experience) across multiple sampling days, which would suggest that they would improve at describing pristine experience as a result of building skill. We trained research assistants to rate levels of subjunctification in 90 brief videos showing DES interviewees in the DES interview. Raters saw no differences between levels of subjunctification in interviewees’ first and fourth <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling,</b> and we concluded that subjunctification does not adequately measure an interviewee’s skill at DES.

The radio=req- activity of endometrial strips taken along the mesometrial and antimesometrial {{aspects of the}} uterine horn varied on average from 270 to 701 c. p. m. /g and no difference (P> 0 =. 5) was found between reproductive status, <b>days</b> <b>of</b> slaughter or <b>sampling</b> sites.

40|$|Rice {{production}} {{is a major}} source of global methane emissions and many studies have been conducted to quantify flux rates of methane alongside N 2 O emissions from rice fields. The closed chamber method with manual sampling is the conventional approach for determining greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rates from rice fields. However, as of now, there is no commonly accepted standard for the measurement protocols, so that published studies encompass a variety of different modalities depending on the specific settings and labour limitations of a given study. This literature study comprises 155 peer-reviewed articles on manual GHG sampling with a static closed chamber as a basis to determine the most common practices of this method regarding the following features: (1)  procedures (duration of chamber closure, number of gas samples per chamber closure and number of replicate chambers), (2)  timing (number of samplings per day and time of <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling)</b> and (3)  intervals (between two consecutive sampling days). It has been found that some features show a high degree of uniformity among these studies, namely, the procedures. On the other hand, other features of the measuring protocol diverge widely (timing and intervals). Derived from these results, the following common practices (compiling features being applied in more than 66 % of the studies that give information on the particular feature) have been identified: duration of chamber closure (30 minutes or less), number of gas samples per chamber closure (3 or 4), number of replicates (3), number of samplings per day (1 or 2), time of <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> (late morning) and interval (7 days or less) ...|$|E

Materials and Methods: A total of 30 postpartum anestrus cows were divided into three equal groups after thorough gynecoclinical examination. The Group 1 animals received an intravaginal progesterone device on day 0 and 2 ml of prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α) on <b>day</b> <b>of</b> CIDR removal (7 th day), Group 2 cows were treated with ovsynch protocol (gonadotropinreleasing hormone [GnRH]-PGF 2 α-GnRH) on day 0, 7 and 9, respectively, and Group 3 cows were supplemented with mineral mixture and treated as control. The serum estrogen, progesterone, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine concentration were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit and absorbance was read at 450 nm with Perkin Elmer Wallac 1420 Microplate Reader. Results: There was a significant increase in progesterone level in Group 1 after withdrawal of CIDR as compared to other two groups.
