50|$|Before bridges were built, {{the main}} means of {{crossing}} {{the river was}} by ferry. A significant number of ferries were provided specifically for navigation purposes. When the towpath changed sides, {{it was necessary to}} take the towing horse and its driver across the river. This was no longer necessary when barges were powered by steam. Some ferries still operate on the river. The Woolwich <b>Ferry</b> <b>carries</b> <b>cars</b> and passengers across the river in the Thames Gateway and links the North Circular and South Circular roads. Upstream are smaller pedestrian ferries, for example Hampton Ferry and Shepperton to Weybridge Ferry the last being the only non-permanent crossing that remains on the Thames Path.|$|E

50|$|After the Second World War, {{railways}} in North America {{started to}} see the dimensions of freight cars increase. Canadian National (identified as CN after 1960) was forced to rely upon rail <b>ferries</b> to <b>carry</b> freight <b>cars,</b> such as hicube boxcars, automobile carriers, certain intermodal cars and chemical tankers, which exceeded {{the limits of the}} tunnel's dimensions.|$|R

Another passenger lounge directly above extends across the width of the ferry. The Tenaka has a vending machine and washrooms, but no other passenger amenities. It has two outside decks astern of each passenger cabin.|$|R
5000|$|Hydrofoils {{have the}} {{advantage}} of higher cruising speeds, succeeding hovercraft on some English Channel routes where the ferries now compete against the Eurotunnel and Eurostar trains that use the Channel Tunnel. Passenger-only hydrofoils also proved a practical, fast and relatively economical solution in the Canary Islands but were recently replaced by faster catamaran [...] "high speed" [...] <b>ferries</b> that can <b>carry</b> <b>cars.</b> Their replacement by the larger craft is seen by critics as a retrograde step given that the new vessels use much more fuel and foster the inappropriate use of cars in islands already suffering from the impact of mass tourism.|$|R
50|$|Union Pacific Railroad's Benicia-Martinez {{drawbridge}} {{is between}} the two vehicle bridges. The railroad bridge was built between 1928 and 1930 for Southern Pacific Railroad to replace its train ferry between Benicia and Port Costa, California. It is the second-longest railway bridge in North America, and the longest railway bridge west of the Mississippi River. Before the bridge was completed, ferries were used to allow the railway to cross Suisun Bay. The original ferry, built at Oakland, California in 1879 and named the Solano, was the world's largest train ferry. In 1914 the larger Contra Costa was built. In 1926 the <b>ferries</b> <b>carried</b> 93,000 passenger <b>cars</b> and 142,000 freight cars across the Strait.|$|R
5000|$|Levitin {{met with}} Serik Akhmetov, on October 25, 2006.

25|$|Moggill Ferry is a cross-river cable ferry {{operated}} by Stradbroke Ferries that connects Moggill and Riverview. Henry Stanley was rowing {{people across the}} river in 1873. He held the lease, which set the fees for the service from 1881-1884. In the 1940s the ferry was motorised under the joint control of the Brisbane and Ipswich City Councils, that <b>ferry</b> which <b>carried</b> four <b>cars</b> at a time {{is now in the}} ferry reserve on the Moggill side of the river. Sometime in the 1970s a 20 vehicle capacity vessel Stradbroke Star formerly on the North Stradbroke Island to Toondah Harbour route and owned by Stradbroke Ferries commenced servicing the crossing.|$|R
50|$|The {{waterways}} in Warnemünde were rebuilt at {{the beginning}} of the 20th century. The new channel was built as a connection to Rostock for wider vessels and the old channel lost its importance for access to Rostock. The Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway (Großherzoglich Mecklenburgische Friedrich-Franz-Eisenbahn), which had acquired the railway in 1894, the Postdampferlinie (mail steamer line) and the Danish State Railway planned to convert the link into a steam-powered train ferry. To allow a train <b>ferry</b> to <b>carry</b> railway <b>cars</b> directly to Denmark, a new railway station and a ferry port were built across the old channel, enabling the direct loading of trains.|$|R
5000|$|The rudderless ferry {{is guided}} by cables {{stretching}} between four 55-foot towers. The current boat, named the [...] "John Craig" [...] after the franchise's original owner, dates to 1996.

[...] The entire ferry site was renovated in 1998, when authorities replaced the four towers and their cables. Two years later, the ferry authority received a federal grant allowing an upgrade of the barge. The new vessel, longer than its predecessor by ten feet, enables the <b>ferry</b> to <b>carry</b> three <b>cars</b> instead of two.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, WSF began {{planning}} {{a replacement for}} their aging Steel Electric-class ferries, which were built in 1927 and were WSF's oldest ferries. They were the only vessels in WSF's fleet that were able to run on the Port Townsend-Keystone route as no other vessel {{could be used in}} the small, shallow Keystone Harbor. WSF planned to move the ferry terminal out of Keystone Harbor and build a 144-car vessel to replace the 60-car Steel Electrics used on the route. Some local residents opposed this plan, so no new ferries were built. When the Steel Electrics were retired in 2007 due to hull corrosion, the WSF had no auto ferries able to serve the Port Townsend - Keystone route. WSF replaced the Steel Electrics with three smaller Kwa-di Tabil class <b>ferries</b> that <b>carry</b> 64 <b>cars</b> and entered service between November 2010 and January 2012.|$|R
50|$|Windermere {{railway station}} offers train and bus {{connections}} to the surrounding areas, Manchester, Manchester Airport and the West Coast Main Line, and is about 1.5 mi from the lakefront. Both Stagecoach and the local council provide frequent connecting buses from Bowness Pier; Stagecoach's open-top double-decker buses travel through the centre of town and continue to Ambleside and Grasmere, while the council's wheelchair-accessible minibuses run {{around the edge of}} town. The Windermere <b>Ferry,</b> a <b>car</b> <b>carrying</b> cable <b>ferry,</b> connects Bowness at Ferry Nab on {{the eastern side of the}} lake with Ferry House Far Sawrey on the western side of the lake, a trip of approximately 10 minutes. For those looking for a more leisurely way to travel there are regular lake cruises running from Bowness Bay to the north end of the lake at Ambleside and south end at Fell Foot.|$|R

5000|$|Dalian-Yantai Tunnel {{is being}} evaluated, but not constructed. Bohai Train <b>Ferry,</b> which <b>carries</b> freight railway <b>cars,</b> trucks, cars and passengers, is {{currently}} used.|$|R
50|$|The ferry {{differs from}} most ferries {{in that it}} is {{literally}} driven, or one could say guided, by a steel cable that is stretched across the river. The cable is secured on each end of the river by steel posts and as the ferry crosses the river, the force of the boat, with the help of rollers {{on the side of the}} boat, pulls the normally submerged cable out of the water. The cable is permanently secured to the ferry and allows for the boat to not stray off course in normal river currents. The <b>ferry</b> only <b>carries</b> two <b>cars</b> at its maximum and does not operate in high water conditions or storms for the threat of the cable snapping in treacherous conditions is too great. Persons wanting to ride the ferry that happen to be on the opposite side of the river than the ferry must blow their horn to summon the ferry. The ferry is free of charge. The ferry operates almost every day except for days of high water and bad weather. The Ferry is on land that was part of the Meherrin Indian Reservation. The Meherrin now live about 10 miles away in the Winton area.|$|R
