This trend continued in other countries (see New Zealand Electricity Market and deregulation) and the role of electricity retailing changed from what was essentially an administrative function within an integrated utility to become a risk management function within a competitive electricity market.|$|R

50|$|The ADO74 project progressed slowly - {{partly due}} to {{continuing}} corporate problems at BL and {{partly due to}} the need for numerous design changes requested by the firm's overseas sales division, Leyland International, which took the view that the ADO74 was too conventional {{and that it would be}} better to create another innovative car rather than compete directly with the <b>established</b> <b>competition.</b> The supermini market moved quickly in the early 'Seventies and the ADO74 underwent several redesigned to keep abreast of these changes in order that it wouldn't be outdated as soon as it was released. Eventually these changes became so significant that BL realized that it would be better to start from scratch. The ADO74 project was cancelled in 1973 and the ADO88 project took its place.|$|E
5000|$|A {{few cars}} were {{imported}} to Belgium {{for a short}} period during 2006, but deliveries were suspended after a EuroNCAP crash test arranged by the ADAC (German Automobile Association): the car achieved only one of possible five stars, a result described as [...] "catastrophic" [...] and [...] "disastrous". A second star was denied because on a side impact test, biometric limits were exceeded. Due to the severe deformation of the car, the likelihood of occupants surviving the crash was low. However, according to a wire report carried by Forbes.com, a heavily strengthened version of BS6 has been tested in Spain by Idiada Automotive Technologies SA. Unlike the test in Germany earlier, the Brilliance garnered a 3-star rating as it passed the test performed in accordance with Euro NCAP guidelines.
