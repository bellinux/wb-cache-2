25|$|The same {{forces that}} created {{the rest of the}} Scandes also created Fulufjället. Indeed, from about 60 million years ago, the west coast of Scandinavia and the {{northeast}} coast of the Americas underwent an important tectonic uplift. The causes of this phenomenon are not clear and many hypotheses have been proposed. One of these hypotheses is the lifting of the Earth's crust by the Iceland hotspot. Another hypothesis is <b>isostasy</b> connected to glaciation. This elevation seems to have been connected to different periods in the north and south of the Scandes, with the middle, between Trondheim and Östersund, a little depressed. In any case, this uplift allowed the formation of a vast flat zone several thousand meters high.|$|E
25|$|Post-glacial rebound (also called either {{isostatic}} rebound or crustal rebound) is {{the rise}} of land masses that were depressed by the huge weight of ice sheets during the last glacial period, through {{a process known as}} isostatic depression. Post-glacial rebound and isostatic depression are different parts of a process known as either glacial <b>isostasy,</b> glacial isostatic adjustment, or glacioisostasy. Glacioisostasy is the solid Earth deformation associated with changes in ice mass distribution. The most obvious and direct effects of post-glacial rebound are readily apparent in parts of Northern Eurasia, Northern America, Patagonia, and Antarctica. However, through processes known as ocean siphoning and continental levering, the effects of post-glacial rebound on sea level are felt globally far from the locations of current and former ice sheets.|$|E
25|$|For various {{geologic}} reasons, modelled differently {{by different}} geologists, {{the zone of}} compression in the Aegean became one of extension: the region widened and dome-like or ovoid massifs were uncovered, or exhumed, from the subduction zones and rose by <b>isostasy.</b> In {{the case of the}} Menderes Massif, which is , the reasons are better known due to geologic research in central Turkey. Anatolia is a triangular block created by the intersection in central Turkey of the North and East Anatolian faults. As the northward-pressing Arabian Plate pushes against this wedge the latter slips to the west but the broad end opens along fault lines like the rays of a fan, extending the massif to the north-northeast and south. This is being called a bivergent (diverges in two places) model.|$|E
25|$|As {{explained}} above, tectonic plates {{may include}} continental crust or oceanic crust, and most plates contain both. For example, the African Plate includes {{the continent and}} parts of the floor of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The distinction between oceanic crust and continental crust is based on their modes of formation. Oceanic crust is formed at sea-floor spreading centers, and continental crust is formed through arc volcanism and accretion of terranes through tectonic processes, though some of these terranes may contain ophiolite sequences, which are pieces of oceanic crust considered {{to be part of the}} continent when they exit the standard cycle of formation and spreading centers and subduction beneath continents. Oceanic crust is also denser than continental crust owing to their different compositions. Oceanic crust is denser because it has less silicon and more heavier elements ("mafic") than continental crust ("felsic"). As a result of this density stratification, oceanic crust generally lies below sea level (for example most of the Pacific Plate), while continental crust buoyantly projects above sea level (see the page <b>isostasy</b> for explanation of this principle).|$|E

2500|$|Recently, {{the term}} post-glacial rebound is {{gradually}} {{being replaced by}} the term glacial isostatic adjustment. This is in recognition that {{the response of the}} Earth to glacial loading and unloading {{is not limited to the}} upward rebound movement, but also involves downward land movement, horizontal crustal motion, changes in global sea levels and the Earth's gravity field, induced earthquakes, and changes in the rotational motion. An alternate term that is sometimes used is glacial <b>isostasy,</b> because the uplift near the centre of rebound is due to the tendency towards the restoration of isostatic equilibrium (as in the case of <b>isostasy</b> of mountains).

2500|$|The {{weight of}} the ice has {{depressed}} the central area of Greenland; the bedrock surface is near sea level {{over most of the}} interior of Greenland, but mountains occur around the periphery, confining the sheet along its margins. If the ice suddenly disappeared, Greenland would most probably appear as an archipelago, at least until <b>isostasy</b> lifted the land surface above sea level once again. The ice surface reaches its greatest altitude on two north-south elongated domes, or ridges. The southern dome reaches almost [...] at latitudes 63°–65°N; the northern dome reaches about [...] at about latitude 72°N (the fourth highest [...] "summit" [...] of Greenland). The crests of both domes are displaced east of the centre line of Greenland. The unconfined ice sheet does not reach the sea along a broad front anywhere in Greenland, so that no large ice shelves occur. The ice margin just reaches the sea, however, in a region of irregular topography in the area of Melville Bay southeast of Thule. Large outlet glaciers, which are restricted tongues of the ice sheet, move through bordering valleys around the periphery of Greenland to calve off into the ocean, producing the numerous icebergs that sometimes occur in North Atlantic shipping lanes. The best known of these outlet glaciers is Jakobshavn Glacier (...) , which, at its terminus, flows at speeds of [...] per day.|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} of <b>isostasy</b> applies {{directly to the}} process of deglaciation, especially post-glacial rebound, which is one of main mechanisms through which <b>isostasy</b> is observed and studied. Post-glacial rebound refers to the increase in tectonic uplift activity immediately following glacial retreat. Increased rates and abundance of volcanic activity have been found in regions experiencing post-glacial rebound. If on a large enough scale, an increase in volcanic activity provides a positive feedback {{to the process of}} deglaciation as a result CO2 and methane released from volcanos.|$|E

5000|$|This {{concept is}} invoked {{to explain how}} {{different}} topographic heights can exist at Earth's surface. When a certain area of Earth's crust reaches the state of <b>isostasy,</b> {{it is said to}} be in isostatic equilibrium. <b>Isostasy</b> does not upset equilibrium but instead restores it (a negative feedback). It is generally accepted [...] that Earth is a dynamic system that responds to loads in many different ways. However, <b>isostasy</b> provides an important 'view' of the processes that are happening in areas that are experiencing vertical movement. Certain areas (such as the Himalayas) are not in isostatic equilibrium, which has forced researchers to identify other reasons to explain their topographic heights (in the case of the Himalayas, which are still rising, by proposing that their elevation is being supported by the force of the impacting Indian plate; the Basin and Range Province of the Western US is another example of a region not in isostatic equilibrium.) ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Isostasy</b> (Greek [...] "equal", [...] "standstill") is {{the state}} of {{gravitational}} equilibrium between Earth's crust and mantle such that the crust [...] "floats" [...] at an elevation that depends on its thickness and density.|$|E
50|$|Understanding the {{principle}} of <b>isostasy</b> {{is a key element}} to understanding the interactions and feedbacks shared between erosion and tectonics. The principle of <b>isostasy</b> states that when free to move vertically, lithosphere floats at an appropriate level in the asthenosphere so that the pressure at a depth of compensation in the asthenosphere well below the base of the lithosphere is the same. Isostatic uplift is both a cause and an effect of erosion. When deformation occurs in the form of crustal thickening an isostatic response is induced causing the thickened crust to sink, and surrounding thinner crust to uplift. The resulting surface uplift leads to enhanced elevations, which in turn induces erosion. Alternatively, when a large amount of material is eroded away from the Earth's surface uplift occurs in order to maintain isostatic equilibrium. Because of <b>isostasy,</b> high erosion rates over significant horizontal areas can effectively suck up material from the lower crust and/or upper mantle. This process is known as isostatic rebound and is analogous to Earth's response following the removal of large glacial ice sheets.|$|E

50|$|Processes of <b>isostasy</b> {{involve the}} uplift of {{continental}} crusts {{along with their}} shorelines.

50|$|When {{analyzing}} the morphology of marine terraces {{it must be}} considered, that both eustasy and <b>isostasy</b> can have an influence on the formation process. This way can be assessed, whether there were changes in sea level or whether tectonic activities took place.|$|E

50|$|Foreland basins form {{because as}} the {{mountain}} belt grows, it exerts a significant mass on the Earth’s crust, which causes it to bend, or flex, downwards. This occurs {{so that the}} weight of the mountain belt can be compensated by <b>isostasy</b> at the upflex of the forebulge.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the impact}} model, the crustal {{plateaus}} were formed by lava ponds from mantle melting due to meteor impacts to the planet's thin lithosphere. Based on this model, the crustal plateaus would be uplifted by <b>isostasy</b> because the mantle underneath the lava ponds are depleted with residual melts {{as compared to}} the neighboring undepleted mantle. However, there are a few issues accompanying this model. The first issue is that scientists are not confident that meteor impacts have the capabilities to melt {{a significant portion of the}} planet's lithosphere and generate enough magma that would cause <b>isostasy.</b> The second issue is the planet's large folds need a high amount of stresses to pass the thin brittle layer, but the underlying magma is not capable of transferring enough stresses through the layer.|$|E
