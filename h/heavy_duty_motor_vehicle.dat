(2000) {{recently}} reported results of applying factor analysis to data taken in six cities from 1979 to 1988, identifying airborne particle sources potentially affecting daily mortality.

In one of the cities, Boston for example, the authors found coal combustion was {{an important source of}} mortality risk. For the city of Boston, the authors attribute coal combustion largely to distant upwind regional sources. The emphasis on coal combustion is confounded by the presence of major local sources of residual oil combustion, which contribute V, Se and S (sulfur as sulfate) to the source apportionment. Evaluation of the source identification using single element tracer analysis indicates that the detailed chemical composition or profile of major local sources needs {{to be taken into account}} in these investigations to minimize misclassification of airborne particle sources with potential adverse health effects. ...|$|R

40|$|Remote sensing was {{employed}} {{for the first}} time to measure NH_ 3 levels in the exhaust of on-road light <b>duty</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The sensor also measured the concentration of CO_ 2, CO, hydrocarbons, and NO, among other pollutants, in the emitted exhaust. Field measurements were conducted at a Los Angeles freeway on-ramp; vehicles traveled at cruise speeds between 20 and 25 m s^(- 1) (45 âˆ’ 55 mi h^(- 1)). Mean fleet NH_ 3 levels of 44. 7 Â± 4. 1 ppm were observed. These emissions exhibited a highly skewed distribution:[*] 50. 1 % of the emitted NH_ 3 was contributed by 10 % of the sampled fleet. The pollutant distribution among high NH_ 3 emitters is analyzed to identify the conditions that lead to three-way catalyst malfunction and, hence, NH_ 3 formation. In contradiction with previous reports, we found that high NH_ 3 emissions could not be attributed to vehicles running under rich air-fuel conditions. We estimate a mean fleet NH_ 3 mass emission rate of 667 Â± 57 mg L^(- 1) (E_r = 94 Â± 8 mg km^(- 1)). These findings could have significant implications on air quality in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) of California, since they support the hypothesis that emissions from <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles</b> constitute a dominant regional source of NH_ 3, between 20 and 27 % of total daily emissions. As NH_ 3 is the predominant atmospheric base, tropospheric levels play a key role in the buffering capacity of the atmosphere and, hence, the formation of fine aerosol.

These gaseous noncriteria pollutants are of interest not only because of their roles in the chemistry of the "clean " and polluted troposphere, including "acid rain, " but also because they may pose health risks disproportionate to their relatively low ambient concentrations, and through complex heterogeneous reactions, they may serve as precursors or catalysts in the formation of "nonclassical " particulate mutagens and carcinogens such as certain nitroarenes associated with combustion generated particulate polycyclic organic matter (POM). Results of research efforts to establish current ambient levels of these noncriteria pollutants and to develop an understanding of their sources, formation and sinks are reported here. First, long pathlength (2 1 km) infrared and UV-visible spectroscopic studies of ambient levels of gaseous HONO, NO 3, HONO 2, PAN, HCHO and HCOOH in southern California atmospheres are described, and data given on their ambient concentrations.

However, no comprehensive inventories currently exist in the international published literature covering this wide size range.

40|$|Most {{particle}} emissions {{generated by}} <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> fleets are ultrafine size (diameters < 0. 1 Âµm) and {{measured in terms}} of particle number. These sized particles are not routinely monitored nor are they regulated by ambient air quality standards. In urban areas around the world travel demand and dependence on private <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> travel is increasing, and thereby potentially contributing higher concentrations of ultrafine particles to urban airsheds. <b>Heavy</b> <b>duty</b> vehicles (HDVs) continue to be a major freight mode. HDVs are particularly high emitters of ultrafine particles and can release over an order of magnitude more particles (in terms of particle number) than petrol-fuelled vehicles, with a significant number in the ultrafine size range. The health effects associated with exposure to particulate matter are well-documented. These are known to be serious, and a number of epidemiological studies have linked exposure to increases in hospital admissions, various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and mortality. However, more epidemiological studies of the effects of ultrafine particles are needed, as well as development of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> emission inventories for ultrafine fine particles. These studies are vital to inform exposure assessment in terms of health, transport and land use planning. Current knowledge about levels of total particulate matter generated by urban <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> fleets, including of ultrafine particle emissions, remain the subject of considerable uncertainty. This limited knowledge has severely impeded our ability to develop effective and relevant ambient air quality standards and strategies to manage and control ultrafine particle emissions. Such regulation is critical for two reasons. Firstly, ultrafine particles are the main source of vehicle fleet emissions. Secondly, because debate is presently focused on the notion that particle number is more directly related to health effects than particle mass.
