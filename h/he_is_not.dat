60|$|In {{his long}} {{ride to the}} city he assured himself in vain that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing right if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> sure of his {{feelings}} towards the girl. It <b>was</b> quite because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> sure of his feeling that <b>he</b> could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> sure <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> acting falsely and cruelly.|$|R
5000|$|What {{has this}} boy {{to do with}} it? <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> his own father; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> his own mother; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> his own grandparents. All of this was handed to him. He did not {{surround}} himself with governesses and wealth. He did not make himself. And yet <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to be compelled to pay.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{elected in}} the 2007 general {{election}} in Wexford polling 3% of the vote. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> re-appointed to the 23rd Seanad in July 2007.|$|R

The two then prepare to wait out the night.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> affected. As for his humble, good self, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> absolved from it. He {{sat down}} and ate heartily. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> tired. <b>He</b> seemed to take no notice of her.|$|R
25|$|One of the London bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan, {{was briefly}} scrutinised by MI5 who {{determined}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a likely threat and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> put under surveillance.|$|R

Season three ends with Claire leaving Frank {{as he prepares to}} go to the New Hampshire primary.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{concluded}} that each wave of frequency f {{is associated with}} a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant. He does not say much more, because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 5 {{looks at}} the inanity of the society depicted, insofar as an {{intellectual}} discussion {{of the work of}} Chatterton between Obtuse Angle, Little Scopprell, Aradobo and Tilly Lally descends into farce; [...] "Obtuse Angle said in the first place you thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> [...] & then afterwards when I said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> you thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not.</b> Why I know that – Oh no sir I thought that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not,</b> but I ask'd to know whether <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> – How can that be said Obtuse Angle how could you ask & think that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> – why said he.

But I meant said Aradobo I I I can't think Law Sir I wish you'd tell me, how it is." [...] Northrop Frye refers to this incident as [...] "farcical conversational deadlock." ...|$|R
60|$|But when {{he walked}} into the parlour where the old man was engaged as Jane had said; with pen and ink and paper on a table close at hand (for Mr Pecksniff was always very {{particular}} to have him well supplied with writing materials), he became less cheerful. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> angry, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> vindictive, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> cross, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> moody, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> grieved; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> sorely grieved. As he sat down by the old man's side, two tears--not tears like those with which recording angels blot their entries out, but drops so precious that they use them for their ink--stole down his meritorious cheeks.|$|R
50|$|In November 2007 Kónya placed {{first at}} the U.S. 24 Hour National Championship race, running 146.25 mi. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{declared}} the national champion however, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a U.S. Citizen.|$|R
5|$|His {{successes in}} Italy secured Nikephoros a {{friendly}} welcome and honours {{on his return}} to Constantinople, but <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> mentioned again for several years, until the outbreak of war with Bulgaria in 894. In the meantime, he was raised {{to the rank of}} patrikios and named to the post of Domestic of the Schools, in effect commander-in-chief of the Byzantine army, {{after the death of his}} predecessor, Andrew the Scythian.|$|E
5|$|Humpty Dumpty is a {{character}} in an English nursery rhyme, probably originally a riddle {{and one of the}} best known in the English-speaking world. He is typically portrayed as a personified egg, though <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> explicitly described as such. The first recorded versions of the rhyme date from late eighteenth-century England and the tune from 1870 in James William Elliott's National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs. Its origins are obscure and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} oil {{study for the}} {{defeated}} warrior (York Art Gallery), Etty gave the character a more defiant appearance than seen in the finished version. In this preliminary sketch <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> on his knees, but thrusts his leg out to brace himself. He has an expression of defiance and determination, rather than the plea for mercy and posture of total defeat shown in the final work.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Surely <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> impudent to you? <b>He</b> <b>was</b> only asserting his right. The cottages {{were taken}} by the year, {{and you have no}} choice but to give six months' notice. I hope <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> disrespectful.' ...|$|R
50|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> re-elected to the Knesset in the 1973 elections, he {{continued}} to serve as Minister of Agriculture until Golda Meir resigned; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> included in Yitzhak Rabin's new government.|$|R
60|$|He {{did not say}} it very loud, for <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{by nature}} a demonstrative man; neither did he whisper it, for <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> ashamed to thank his God for mercies received.|$|R
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of the show's animation style, Stan is composed of simple geometrical shapes and primary colors. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters; his character is mostly shown from only one angle, and his movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion.|$|E
5|$|Jōjirō is {{a first-year}} student at Hoshinoumi Academy {{and is a}} member of its student council. His ability enables him to move at very fast speeds, but <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> able to control where he stops, {{resulting}} in frequent injuries. To counteract this, he wears protective gear under his clothes. He is a huge fan of Yusa Nishimori and is extremely obsessed with her.|$|E
5|$|Liu Kang is {{also one}} of the lead {{characters}} in the 1996 animated series , voiced by Brian Tochi. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the protagonist therein as opposed to the game storyline, instead sharing this role with several other Earthrealm heroes.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{news media}} seizing the salacious [...] "drugs-for-sex" [...] {{aspect of the}} story, Silverthorne {{maintains}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> distributing methamphetamine [...] "for sex," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> tried for any sexual crimes.|$|R
50|$|Like his predecessor, Andrés de Tapia Motelchiuh, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> of {{the upper}} class, so <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{designated}} a tlatoani, but rather a cuauhtlato (eagle captain). Even so, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> considered a successor to the tlatoques, or rulers.|$|R
25|$|When the Luton cell was ended, {{one of the}} London bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan (no known relation), was scrutinised briefly by MI5 who {{determined}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a likely threat and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> surveilled.|$|R

5|$|Middlebrooks is an {{athletic}} defensive player. He hits {{for power and}} is also credited for his contact skills, though <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> considered the most patient hitter. His throwing arm is well regarded, and his baserunning is rated as average.|$|E
5|$|Nash has {{a medical}} {{condition}} called spondylolisthesis, which causes muscle tightness and back pain. Due to the condition, when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> playing in basketball games, he lies on his back rather than {{sitting on the bench}} to keep his muscles from stiffening.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> granted {{access to}} a lawyer until 15 March 2004, when he {{appeared}} before the People's Court charged with affiliation to the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> given the choice of his attorney.|$|R
50|$|However, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> an officer, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{given the}} {{opportunity}} of joining those who escaped from the camp and so remained in the prison until it was liberated {{at the end of}} the war.|$|R
50|$|Yet {{nothing was}} said in all those years that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a citizen of Tanganyika. It was only decades later, in the 1990s, that the {{government}} said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a Tanzanian but a Malawian. Others said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a Mozambican.|$|R
