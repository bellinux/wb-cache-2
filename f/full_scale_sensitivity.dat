40|$|Using micro-machined silicon technology, an ultra-sensitive {{miniature}} acce.,rometer can {{be constructed}} which meets the requirements for microgravity experiments in the space environment. Such an accelerometer will have a <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 1 C 2 g a resolution of lC 8 g, low cross axis sensitivity, and low temperature sensitivity. Mass of the device is approximately five grams and its footprint is 2 cm x 2 cm. Innovative features of the accelerometer, which are patented, are: electrostatic caging to withstand handling shock up to 150 g, in-situ calibration, in situ performance characterization, and both static and dynamic compensation. The transducer operates on a force balance principle wherein the displacement of the proof mass is monitored by measuring tunneling electron current flow between a conductive tip, and a fixed platen. The four major parts of the accelerometer are tip die, incorporating the tunneling tip and four field plates for controlling pitch and roll of the proof mass; two proof mass dies, attached to the surrounding frame by sets of four leg" springs; and a force plate die. The four parts are fuse-bonded into a complete assembly. External electrical connections are made at bond pads on the front surface of the force plate die.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{reference}} setup for the characterization and calibration of low range differential pressure sensors is presented. The setup utilizes {{the principle of}} ideal gas law and actuates on the volume for accurate reference pressure inputs for the calibration process. The error sources for the proposed setup are analysed and an error propagation modelis presented. The range of the setup is ± 320 Pa, with the resolution of 0. 001 % of <b>full</b> <b>scale.</b> The verified <b>sensitivity</b> of the setup is 0. 032 Pa. A complete characterization of a high performance differential pressure transducer is conducted as a test case study for the performance analysis of the proposed setup. During these experiments {{the sensitivity of the}} calibration setup to the thermal gradient is observed. To this end, the effects of thermal gradient on the transient response of the setup are also studied, utilizing a comparative experimental study. From the presented experimental study it is concluded that the thermal gradient can cause the system to remain in transient state for at least 96 hours. To reduce this effect, a mechanical design optimization is proposed and a finite element model is presented to be studied in comparison to its preceding design for its thermal performance. From the results it is concluded that the optimized design can reduce the transient time of the measurement system due to thermal gradient, by 11 times. Future work is also proposed to further investigate the optimized model for implementation purposes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of effective environmental management plans and policies requires a sound {{understanding of the}} driving forces involved in shaping and altering the structure and function of ecosystems. However, driving forces, especially anthropogenic ones, are defined and operate at multiple administrative levels, which do not always match ecological scales. This paper presents an innovative methodology of analysing drivers of change by developing a typology of <b>scale</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of drivers that classifies and describes the way they operate across multiple administrative levels. <b>Scale</b> <b>sensitivity</b> varies considerably among drivers, which can be classified into five broad categories depending on the response of ‘evenness’ and ‘intensity change’ when moving across administrative levels. Indirect drivers tend to show low <b>scale</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> whereas direct drivers show high <b>scale</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> as they operate in a non-linear way across the administrative scale. Thus policies addressing direct drivers of change, in particular, need to take scale into consideration during their formulation. Moreover, such policies must have a strong spatial focus, which can be achieved either by encouraging local–regional policy making or by introducing high flexibility in (inter) national policies to accommodate increased differentiation at lower administrative levels. High quality data is available for several drivers, however, the availability of consistent data at all levels for non-anthropogenic drivers is a major constraint to mapping and assessing their <b>scale</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> This lack of data may hinder effective policy making for environmental management, since it restricts the ability to fully account for <b>scale</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of natural drivers in policy design...|$|R

40|$|By use of {{test data}} from the Cone Calorimeter bench scale test and two <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> fire tests (IS 0 Room Corner Test and CSTB Room Fire Test), {{relationships}} between smoke test data for the two scales were investigated. The study was based on test results for 38 products. Bench <b>scale</b> and <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> smoke production were normalized to either area burnt, mass loss or heat release and then compared. The most interesting parameter was smoke production per heat release, and for the products tested in the CSTB Room Fire Test there was found good correlation and a correlation coefficient of 0. 99. It was shown that smoke production in <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> was only about 45 - 60 % of what was found in bench scale, and this is probably due to secondary combustion which occurs in the hot smoke layer. Before a secondary combustion occurs, the room fire is ventilation controlled and can produce more smoke than is found in bench <b>scale.</b> Thus the <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> fire influence smoke production {{in a way that}} may hinder relationship between bench <b>scale</b> and <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> smoke parameters. <b>Full</b> <b>scale</b> smoke test {{data from the}} IS 0 Room Corner Test were difficult to calculate, due to problems with finding the net heat release from the burnt products and the estimated burnt area. A one-to-one relationship between bench <b>scale</b> and <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> for the average effective heat of combustion (~ h,,, ~) was found and the plot obtained a correlation coefficient of 0. 99.
