Importantly, Sufu-Gli and Sox 10 form a regulatory loop to control neuronal versus glial lineage differentiation and migration of NCCs.

Hedgehog and Notch are implicated in mediating proliferation and differentiation of ENCCs. Nevertheless, how these signaling molecules may interact to mediate gut colonization by ENCCs and contribute to a primary etiology for HSCR are not known. Here, we report our pathway- based epistasis analysis of data generated by a genome-wide association study on HSCR disease, which indicates that specific genotype constellations of Patched (PTCH 1) (which encodes a receptor for Hedgehog) and delta-like 3 (DLL 3) (which encodes a receptor for Notch) SNPs confer higher risk to HSCR. Importantly, deletion of Ptch 1 in mouse ENCCs induced robust Dll 1 expression and activation of the Notch pathway, leading to premature gliogenesis and reduction of ENCC progenitors in mutant bowels. Dll 1 integrated Hedgehog and Notch pathways to coordinate neuronal and glial cell differentiation during enteric nervous system development. In addition, Hedgehog-mediated gliogenesis was found to be highly conserved, such that Hedgehog was consistently able to promote gliogenesis of human neural crest-related precursors. Collectively, we defined PTCH 1 and DLL 3 as HSCR susceptibility genes and suggest that Hedgehog/Notch-induced premature gliogenesis may represent a new disease mechanism for HSCR. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

Although mutations in the RET-proto tyrosine kinase receptor have frequently been associated with this disease, {{it is still not}} entirely clear what is the precise underlying molecular mechanism. Evidences from genetic and animal studies suggest mutations in the RET gene can result in reduced expression level or comprised protein function that might be the cause of HSCR. To date, advancements in stem cell technology allow us to directly address individual gene function using an in vitro neuronal differentiation system that can mimics this process during embryonic development. In this study, we aim to define the role of RET signalling in human neural crest cell (NCC) development by generating an isogenic human iPS cell harbouring a RET deletion mutation using CRISPR-Cas 9. By comparing the in vitro neuronal differentiation capabilities of RET mutant cells to that of isogenic wild type control cell, we found that iPS cells carrying coding sequence mutation in RET was able to generate NCCs in a comparable manner to the control. However, when these RET mutant NCCs were subjected to further neuronal differentiation, we observed reduced neuronal differentiation as compared to the control. We also found reduced cell migration and increased cell death in the RET mutant NCCs.

40|$|Poster PresentationSession: Intestinal / Gut CellsDuring enteric {{nervous system}} (ENS) development, {{coordination}} of neurogenesis and gliogenesis require an appropriate {{balance between the}} proliferation and differentiation of enteric neural crest cells (NCCs). Defects in these processes may lead to intestinal aganglionosis, <b>Hirschsprung</b> (HSCR) <b>disease</b> in humans. We have previously shown that aberrant Hedgehog signaling interferes both proliferation and differentiation of NCCs and results in disease predisposition, but the underlying molecular and cellular events remain unclear. In this study, we further delineated {{the roles of the}} three key Hedgehog effector genes namely Gli 1, Gli 2 and Gli 3 in ENS development. Western blot analysis with FACS-sorted NCCs revealed that Gli signaling is transiently activated during NCC differentiation. Using an in vivo reporter of Gli activity, we demonstrated that Gli activity is elevated in the early committed ENCCs. Transient high Gli signaling is required for the proper ENS development, as constitutively high Gli activity by conditional ablation of Suppressor of Fused (Sufu) in NCCs resulted in impaired neuronal differentiation, axonal fasciculation, gangliogenesis and early onset of glial lineage differentiation of NCCs. The ratio of Gli 2 activator (Gli 2 A) and Gli 3 repressor (Gli 3 R) was particularly critical for ENS development, as they restrained the differentiation and cell cycle progression of NCCs. Aberrantly high Gli 2 A to Gli 3 R ratio in the NCCs resulted in dysregulation of cell cycle gene expression and an increase in S and G 2 /M phase, accompanied by early onset of NCC differentiation. Similarly, Gli 3 Δ 699 / Δ 699 mice, where a truncated form of Gli 3 that mimics Gli 3 R was constitutively produced, exhibited reduced neuronal and glial differentiation, suggesting that forced expression of Gli 3 R was deleterious to NCC differentiation. Taken together, our findings suggest that transient activation of Gli activity promotes cell cycle progression and initiates NCC differentiation by regulating multiple proliferative signaling pathways. Aberrant Gli activity interferes NCC development and may contribute to HSCR pathogenesis...|$|R

T- 2014 <b>Hirschsprung</b> (HSCR) <b>disease</b> is {{a complex}} {{congenital}} disorder attributed to a failure of enteric neural crest cells (NCCs) to fully colonize the bowel and form ganglia in the hindgut, leading to bowel obstruction and megacolon. A significant number of HSCR patients also suffer from other disorders of NC origin, such as ventricular and atrial septal defects (VSD/ASD). The pathologies of these disorders are largely unclear. Recently, we have established iPSC lines from a syndromic HSCR patient with VSD/ASD. While these patient iPSCs showed similar capacity for generating NCCs (p 75 NTR+; HNK 1 +), their NCC derivatives exhibited severe differentiation defects in making neurons and cardiac smooth muscle cells (SMC). Intriguingly, the neural differentiation defects were restricted to NC lineage. The capacity of patient iPSC to make various types of CNS progenitors (PAX 6 +) and neurons was {{comparable to that of}} the control iPSC, nicely recapitulating the patient’s phenotype where only enteric neurons, but not CNS progenitors were affected. These observations prompted us to further delineate the causative genes/pathways that lead to failure of making neurons/glia or cardiac SMCs. By transcriptome sequencing, we revealed that FACS sorted p 75 NTR+; HNK 1 + population express various NC markers (e. g. SNAI 1, NGFR(p 75 NTR), TWIST, TFAP 2 A, SOX 10, PHOX 2 B, SOX 9, SOX 10, RET and PAX 3), a gene expression pattern conferring multipotency of NCCs. Subsequent comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of the control and patient iPSC-derived NCCs and their derivatives showed that pathway genes implicated in neural (ERBB 4, NGFR, EDNRB, SOX 10, NGF, EDN 1 / 2) and SMC (e. g. GATA 6, HAND 1) differentiation are consistently dysregulated in the patient cells. More importantly, premature upregulation of glial differentiation markers was detected in the patient NCCs, suggesting that the neuronal differentiation defects of patient NCCs would be the result of differentiation bias towards glial lineage. Taken together, our data indicated that NCCs generated from patient iPSC could serve as a useful human disease model for a better understanding of molecular pathogenesis of neurocristopathies...|$|R
40|$|Enteric {{nervous system}} (ENS) is {{composed}} of interconnected enteric ganglia, which are derived from a small population of progenitors, namely enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs). During development, ENCCs undergo extensive proliferation and differentiation, precisely coordinating with a long migration journey to fully colonize the entire gut and form a functional nervous system. Defects {{in any of these}} developmental processes may result in <b>Hirschsprung</b> (HSCR) <b>disease</b> or other gut motility disorders. Our group has previously demonstrated that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is indispensable for ENS development. Here, we focused on another key Hh component, Kinesin family member 7 (Kif 7), which is a motor protein regulating Hh signaling transduction in cilium. To delineate the roles of Kif 7 in ENS development, we conditionally knocked out Kif 7 in NCCs. We found that Kif 7 KO mice exhibit retarded growth with poor survival rate. In particular, the growth retardation was closely associated with the severity of the gut defects. Colonic migrating motor complexes (CMMCs) analysis further suggested that colonic motility of Kif 7 KO mice is interrupted, leading to extended intestinal transit time and growth retardation. We then investigated how Kif 7 may affect ENS development. Deletion of Kif 7 consistently disrupted both neuronal differentiation and proliferation of ENCCs at early developmental stages, accompanied by disorganization of nerve network in embryonic gut. Subsequent immunohistochemistry analyses with various glial and neuronal markers further revealed the presence of giant myenteric ganglion in mutant adult gut. In addition, a dramatic reduction in nNOS+ inhibitory neurons in the myenteric plexuses of distal small intestine and colon, deficiency of submucosal plexuses and reduced neuronal/glial projections in intestinal villi were observed in the mutant mice. All these data suggested that Kif 7 regulates the formations of both myenteric and submucosal plexuses, probably also neuronal subtypes. Aberrant ganglion formation and loss of nNOS+ neurons may account for the gut motility defects in the mutants. To further delineate the underlying molecular mechanism, microarray analysis was performed with control and Kif 7 KO ENCCs, where genes regulating the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor population (Erbb 3, Sox 2 and Sox 10) were found down-regulated in Kif 7 KO ENCCs, implying that loss of Kif 7 interrupts the regulatory networks of these molecules and interferes the development of ENS...|$|R

It is diagnosed by biopsies from anorectal transitional zone. This study aimed to evaluate the association between Hirschsprung and anorectal problems. Method: Sixty three patients with anorectal problems who underwent surgery enrolled in this study. Some consecutive biopsies were obtained from anal canal at 2, 4 and 6 cm above the dentate line. Biopsies were assessed for ganglion cells changes. Patients' data and biopsies results were analyzed with SPSS version 18. Results: Out of 63 patients 29 (46 %) patients were female and 34 (54 %) were male with the mean of 32. 65 ± 13. 73 years. Fifty six (73 %) patients complained from constipation with the mean time of 57. 65 ± 45. 21 months. Aganglionic zone were reported in six patients with the mean length of 43. 33 mm. There was not any relation between anal ganglion cells pathology and constipation (p= 0. 363), but there was a significant relation between duration of constipation and pathologic changes (p= 0. 001). The ratio of constipation duration to age was related to anal ganglion cell pathology (p= 0. 001). Hemorrhoid degree was also affected anal ganglion cells pathology (p= 0. 037).
