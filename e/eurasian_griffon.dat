Inside the caves there are several species of bats, such as the cave bat, greater horseshoe bat, lesser horseshoe bat, and Geoffroy's bat. Other mammal species that live in the region include the Pyrenean desman, wildcat, dormouse or the Eurasian otter.|$|R
2500|$|Discreet habitat {{preferences}} may coincidentally spare many owls, as owls {{from the}} genera Strix, Glaucidium, Aegolius and the [...] northern hawk-owl (Surnia ulula) tend to restrict both nesting and their hunting forays to more enclosed areas of woodland than habitats inhabited by the eagle-owls. Meanwhile, Asio, Otus, Athene and barn owls owls tend to hunt in more open habitats than the edges favored by eagle-owls. However, habitat preferences are never enough to spare {{any of these}} genera from predation by the great eagle-owl. In the Italian Alps, despite differing habitat preferences and partially overlapping prey, several tawny owls were killed by eagle-owls. Woodland nesting owl species tend to nest in tree hollows, {{many of which are}} too small for an eagle-owl to access, so are somewhat less likely to be picked off at their nests. Open-country owls that tend to nest in open-access nesting sites like short-eared owls and little owls may be somewhat more vulnerable at the nest. The great numbers of long-eared owls taken, since it often nest in dense, protective thickets, are probably adult or immature owls attempting to hunt. In Europe, Eurasian eagle-owls are generally the only owls to regularly nest in rocky habitats. This is not the case in arid desert-like regions, where limited nesting options frequently force diverse owls to use rocky areas as nesting sites. However, the cliffs and other rocky areas preferred by Eurasian eagle-owls are also utilized by several species of diurnal raptor in Eurasia. In Spain, golden eagles, Bonelli's eagles and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) most often nest on cliffs. Large scavenging birds such as cinereous vultures (Aegypius monachus), bearded vultures (Gypaetus barbatus), <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffons</b> (Gyps fulvus), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and common ravens also often nests on the same Iberian cliffs. While the two eagles nested at great distances from one another (they are known to be territorial towards each other), the eagle-owl nesting within [...] of the other species. In these cliff nests, the only considerable predatory interaction was the eagle-owls appearing to predate the peregrine falcons. In the Tibetan Plateau, upland buzzards (Buteo hemilasius) also seem to favor similar habitats and both the eagle-owl and buzzard take similar prey there. In general, the eagle-owl can nest closer to diurnal raptors because, as a nocturnal animal, it will not actively compete for territories as it would with other members of its own species.|$|R
50|$|The {{griffon vulture}} (Gyps fulvus) {{is a large}} Old World vulture in the bird of prey family Accipitridae. It {{is also known as}} the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon.</b> It is not to be {{confused}} with a different species, Rüppell's griffon vulture (Gyps rueppellii).|$|E
50|$|Gyps {{species were}} the most {{affected}} by diclofenac. The population of the White-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis) fell 99.7% between 1993 and 2002. The populations of the Indian vulture (Gyps indicus) and the slender-billed vulture (Gyps tenuirostris) fell 97.4%. The percentages differ slightly because the white-rumped vulture is more sensitive to diclofenac {{than the other two}} species, but all three were in danger of extinction. Two other species of Gyps, the Himalayan vulture (Gyps himalayensis) and the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon</b> (Gyps fulvus) were less affected, the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon</b> because it only winters in India and has a much smaller initial population and the Himalayan vulture, with a similarly small population, because it is exclusively mountain-dwelling. Vulture populations have continued to decline in India at a rate of between 20% and 40% each year since 2007.|$|E

50|$|It {{usually is}} 80 - 103 cm long {{and has a}} wing span of 1.96 to 2.38 m. It weighs 5.5 - 6.3 kg. It is smaller and less heavily built than the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon.</b> It is {{distinguished}} from that species by its less buff body and wing coverts. It also lacks the whitish median covert bar shown by Griffon.|$|E
50|$|The white-rumped vulture is a typical, {{medium-sized}} vulture, with an unfeathered {{head and}} neck, very broad wings, and short tail feathers. It {{is much smaller}} than the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Griffon.</b> It has a white neck ruff. The adult's whitish back, rump, and underwing coverts contrast with the otherwise dark plumage. The body is black and the secondaries are silvery grey. The head is tinged in pink and bill is silvery with dark ceres. The nostril openings are slit-like. Juveniles are largely dark and take about four or five years to acquire the adult plumage. In flight, the adults show a dark leading edge of the wing and has a white wing-lining on the underside. The undertail coverts are black.|$|E
50|$|The {{lappet-faced vulture}} {{is a huge}} species, ranking as the longest and largest winged vulture in its range behind the closely related cinereous vulture, {{although}} some co-occurring Gyps vultures tend to be heavier on average, especially the Cape vulture and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon.</b> This species measures around 95 - 115 cm in body length, with a wingspan of 2.5 - 2.9 m. Among the standard measurements, the wing chord is 71.5 - 82.5 cm, the tail is 33 - 36 cm and the tarsus is 12.2 - 15 cm. The bill, at up to 10 cm long and 5 cm deep, {{ranks as one of}} the largest of any accipitrid, although a reported culmen length of 7.2 cm is slightly less than the culmen length of the cinereous vulture. Wild vultures, of the subspecies T. t. tracheliotus, range from 4.4 to 9.4 kg and, in East Africa, average only 6.2 kg.

40|$|Although {{formerly}} {{an abundant}} species, the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Griffon</b> (Gyps fulvus Hablizl, 1783) {{has undergone a}} dramatic decline in Herzegovina. Such an unfavorable trend {{may be associated with}} frequent poisoning incidents (consumption of poisoned baits), shortage of food and hunting. This species disappeared from its breeding habitats in Herzegovina during {{the last decade of the}} 20 th century. The extinction was probably caused by military activities during the civil war. Using data that were collected over a period of long-term (1980 - 1991) monitoring of the breeding population, we discovered optimal environmental conditions for the nesting of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Griffon</b> Vulture in Herzegovina. Information on nest-site preference is valuable for conservation programs and the possible reintroduction of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Griffon,</b> not only in Herzegovina, but also to a much wider region. During the study period, we observed 61 nests and 252 nesting cases in four colonies of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Griffon</b> Vulture. Most nests were located on limestone and dolomite rocks. The average altitude of nests was 378 m a. s. l.; most of nests (85 %) were located below 500 m a. s. l. Also, the majority of nests were located on west-exposed sites...|$|E
40|$|Using multivariate {{analyses}} we examined differences in breeding {{density of the}} Bearded Vulture Gypaetus barbatus, the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Griffon</b> Vulture Gyps fulvus and the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus in NE Spain (Catalonia) in relation to trophic, orographic¿landscape and anthropic variables. Sampling units used were regional divisions (comarques). High density of Bearded Vulture was principally linked to areas with scant vegetation and low human population density. In contrast, high densities of both the Egyptian and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Griffon</b> Vultures were associated with availability of trophic resources (sheep and goats). Positive effects were detected in relation to low density of inhabitants (Egyptian Vulture) and altitudes between 1, 000 - 2, 000 m and landscape with low tree cover (<b>Eurasian</b> <b>Griffon</b> Vulture). The Bearded Vulture {{seemed to be the}} most selective species in relation to environmental characteristics while the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Griffon</b> and the Egyptian Vultures displayed a higher degree of ecological plasticity. Future conservation actions should bear these results in mind in order to optimise management. Food resources from extensive livestock farming, in particular, seem fundamental for the conservation of scavenger species. Preference monitoring and conservation efforts are needed in the regions with highest vulture densities (Alta Ribagorça, Pallars Jussà and Alt Urgell), while regions with low vulture populations should be managed in order to favour the geographical expansion and recolonisation of zones currently not occupied by these species. Conservation priorities should be based on favouring extensive livestock practices, and as an alternative to muladares (traditional animal carcass disposal sites) farmers should be encouraged to leave animal carcasses in the field, while ensuring compliance with health regulations...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) was analyzed in different free-living wild animals {{to assess the}} genetic diversity and predominant genotypes on each animal species. Samples {{were taken from the}} skin and/or nares, and isolates were characterized by spa typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The proportion of MSSA carriers were 5. 00, 22. 93, 19. 78, and 17. 67 % in <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon</b> vulture, Iberian ibex, red deer, and wild boar, respectively (P = 0. 057). A higher proportion of isolates (P = 0. 000) were recovered from nasal samples (78. 51 %) than skin samples (21. 49 %), but the 9. 26 % of red deer and 18. 25 % of wild boar would have been undetected if only nasal samples had been tested. Sixty-three different spa types were identified, including 25 new spa types. The most common were t 528 (43. 59 %) in Iberian ibex, t 548 and t 11212 (15. 79 % and 14. 04 %) in red deer, and t 3750 (36. 11 %) in wild boar. By MLST, 27 STs were detected, of which 12 had not been described previously. The most frequent were ST 581 for Iberian ibex (48. 72 %), ST 425 for red deer (29. 82 %), and ST 2328 for wild boar (42. 36 %). Isolates from <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon</b> vulture belong to ST 133. Host specificity has been observed for the most frequent spa types and STs (P = 0. 000). The highest resistance percentage was found against benzylpenicillin (average, 22. 2 %), although most of the S. aureus isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial tested.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the spatial ecology and ranging {{behaviour}} of vultures in Europe. In this paper we used GPS satellite telemetry to assess home-ranges of eight non-breeding <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Griffon</b> Vultures in Spain, trying to answer the main questions on when (i. e. the time of the day), how far (i. e. hourly and daily distances) and where vultures range (i. e. home-range size). Results indicated that vultures ranged extensively mainly in areas where traditional stock-raising practices and pasturing were still common, also including some vulture restaurants, which were visited occasionally. <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Griffon</b> Vultures concentrated their hourly and daily movements {{in the middle of the}} day, when the availability of thermal updrafts was higher, favouring foraging activities. The overall foraging range, calculated as Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) (7419 km 2), or as 95 % and 50 % kernel contours (4078 km 2 and 489 km 2, respectively), was higher than those reported in previous studies.

40|$|Despite the {{consensus}} among ecologists and conservationists {{of the importance}} of maintaining scavenger feeding patterns based primarily on natural prey sources, human-mediated feeding remains a widely used management tool for threatened wildlife. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} the key factors favoring certain species and age-groups at supplementary feeding sites. Through a detailed videomonitored experiment of carrion inputs at different locations in the Iberian Peninsula (home of > 90 % of European vultures), we assessed how variables related to weather, time, demography, management and alternative food availability influenced the occurrence patterns of different age-classes of vultures at feeding sites. The most threatened and less gregarious species (bearded vulture Gypaetus barbatus and Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus) attended to earlier inputs, thus reducing interspecific competition with the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon</b> vulture Gyps fulvus. The bearded vulture was favored by a larger biomass supply at the feeding sites during the chick-rearing period, while the Egyptian vulture preferred frequent and abundant inputs. Non-adult cinereous vultures Aegypius monachus were favored at times of lower abundance of natural resources and in the densest networks of feeding sites, while adults preferentially attended sites with periodic inputs close to breeding colonies in areas with lower availability of other natural prey. Finally, the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon</b> vulture showed a preference for continued and periodic inputs, and for feeding sites with numerous other feeding sites in the surroundings. Our results help to inform the management of supplementing food provision with the aim of enhancing its value to reverse the unfavorable conservation status of endangered species and to mitigate the negative effects of the current global threats impacting them...|$|E
40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a {{life-threatening}} pathogen in humans and {{its presence in}} animals is a public health concern. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the prevalence of MRSA in free-living wild animals. Samples from red deer (n= 273), Iberian ibex (n= 212), <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Griffon</b> vulture (n= 40) and wild boar (n= 817) taken from different areas in Spain between June 2008 and November 2011 were analyzed. Characterization of the isolates was performed by spa typing, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A low prevalence of MRSA was found with 13 isolates obtained from 12 animals (0. 89 %; 95 % CI: 0. 46 - 1. 56). All MRSA sequence types belonged to ST 398 (t 011 and t 1451) and ST 1 (t 127). Genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns (tetracycline resistance in ST 398 and clindamycin-erythromycin-tetracycline resistance in ST 1) suggest that the MRSA found probably originated in livestock (ST 398) or humans (ST 1). This is the first report of MRSA carriers in free-living wild animals in Europe. Although our data showed that MRSA prevalence is currently low, free-living wild animals might act as reservoir and represent a potential risk for human health.

However, the magnitude and complexity of these effects may still be greatly underestimated. Most Old World vultures have experienced rapid population declines in recent years. In Europe, their immediate conservation depends on changes in health regulations affecting the availability of food provided by domestic carcasses. Information is lacking on the effects of a hypothetical food shortage on the population dynamics of vultures, and is necessary to assess the potential impacts of policy decisions on future changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services. Anovel computational model (P-systems) was used to model these effects, forecasting a rapid decline in the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon</b> vulture (Gyps fulvus).

Here we report an exceptional case of soft tissue fossilization of a Late Pleistocene <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon</b> vulture (Gyps fulvus) in the pyroclastic sequence of the Alban Hills volcanic region (SE Rome, Italy). CT analyses have revealed an exceptional natural cast of the complete head and neck that preserve extraordinary detail including the fossilized everted tongue, beak, feather insertions and the first record of the nictitating membrane of the eye. This fossilization (superior in detail even to the victims of the AD 79 Plinian eruption of Vesuvius) reveals no evidence of burning and requires re-evaluation of the thermal constraints in operation for the preservation of organic materials within pyroclastic sediments. The analysis of the external morphological features has provided key information regarding the taphonomic processes in operation, the emplacement temperatures of distal pyroclastic flow deposits and the relationships between organic materials and low temperature phreatomagmatic flows.

40|$|In this work, we {{describe}} the biodiversity of cloacal and pharynx culture-based bacteria (commensal and pathogenic), in 75 <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon</b> vultures (Gyps fulvus) fromtwo geographic areas. We {{address the question of}} whether the cultivable microbiota of vultures is organised into assemblages occurring by chance. In addition, we assess bacterial diversity in both anatomic regions and geographic areas. Bacterial diversity was represented by 26 Gram-negative and 20 Gram-positive genera. The most common genera were Escherichia, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Clostridium and Lactococcus. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were the most common species in cloacal and pharyngeal samples. Staphylococcus and Erysipelothrix were isolated from the pharynx and Salmonella and Corynebacterium from the cloacae, and no Campylobacter was isolated from the cloacal swabs. Ten cloacal swabs were positive for Salmonella, of which five isolates were Salmonella enterica serotype 4,(5), 12 :i:-, one isolate was S. enterica serotype Derby, three isolates were S. enterica serotype 61 :k: 1, 5, 7 and one isolate was S. enterica serotype Infantis. The null modelling approach revealed that the commensal bacteria of vultures are not structured in assemblages. On the other hand, differences in bacterial genus and species richness between cloacal and pharyngeal samples or between geographic areas were clear, with the pharynx in vultures from both geographic areas being richer. The results of this study indicate also that vultures can serve as a reservoir of certain pathogenic zoonotic bacteria. The dissemination of these zoonotic pathogens in wildlife could be prevented by periodic sanitary surveys...|$|E
40|$|Supplementary feeding {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{techniques}} used to alleviate threats to scavengers species related to the quality and availability of food resources. Because supplementary feeding may have undesired effects, the management of supplementary sites should be optimized from an ecological and conservation perspective. We installed high-resolution videocameras at six Spanish feeding stations recording more that 7500 h of observations at 105 feeding events. We analyzed food preferences in the four European vulture species (<b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon</b> vulture Gyps fulvus, Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, bearded vulture Gypaetus barbatus and cinereous vulture Aegypius monachus) as they relate to the characteristics of the food remains and carcasses provided at feeding sites. Our results suggest that carrion features (format, scattering, prey species, biomass and items) influence differential selection between species and age-classes. At a species level, large inputs of unscattered carrion increased the abundance of actively feeding griffon vultures. The ratio of the abundance of bearded vultures, Egyptian vultures and cinereous vultures with respect to griffon vultures was favored when less biomass was supplied and when the food provided was not presented as whole carcasses. Thus, using medium-size ungulates (i. e. sheep and goats) presented as small, abundant and scattered pieces favors the consumption of the resource by the most endangered species. Our findings can be used to optimize the supplementary provisioning of vultures in cases where this conservation tool is considered essential for managing targeted species or population groups...|$|E
40|$|The {{outbreak}} of {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} provoked restrictive European sanitary legislation that forced farmers to remove livestock carcasses from the wild. This had serious repercussions for the scavenger raptor guild. Against this background, we developed a study to analyse the foraging movements of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon</b> vultures (Gyps fulvus) in northern Spain. We ringed 241 griffon vultures with alphanumeric plastic rings in Biscay between 2000 and 2011 and set experimental feeding stations in 24 sites over an area of 10, 614 km 2; recording re-sightings of the ringed vultures between 2005 and 2012. Using these re-sighting records, we tested whether birds randomly moved long distances whilst searching for food, or if vulture re-sightings were restricted to a few feeding sites within a limited area. We summarised 329 field-work days, {{with an average of}} 2. 06 ringed vultures re-sighted per day, accounting for 1, 017 re-sightings. Adult vultures were detected in three separate foraging nuclei within the study area. Movements out of the main foraging nuclei were statistically less frequent than would be expected if adult vultures accessed all resources at a similar rate. Once established at breeding areas, subadult vultures behaved {{in the same way as}} adults. Our results suggest that vultures’ home ranges are largely restricted to zones close to breeding areas. This has important consequences from a conservation point of view, suggesting that management decisions should take into consideration spatial scale effects. P.

40|$|In colonial {{breeding}} species, {{preventive measures}} {{to reduce the}} risks of extra-pair copulations (EPCs) should reflect the actual risk perceived by males (e. g., proximity of neighbors, intrusions into the nest) mainly during the fertile period.

Here we tested at <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Griffon</b> Vulture (Gyps fulvus) nesting sites the intensity of paternity assurance behavior, shown as frequency and duration of withinpair copulations (WPCs), potential mate vigilance or nest attendance, and levels of aggressivity. This was measured according to the frequency of territorial intrusions and comparison of the fertile vs. the non-fertile period. Our {{findings suggest that the}} frequency of WPCs and their duration increased significantly during the presumed fertile period, regarded as the period when Griffon pairs spent significantly more time together at their nests. In addition, low levels of territorial intrusions were observed, an aggressive response of pairs towards intruders, and a relatively high presence of pairs at the nests during the fertile period. Thus, although nesting sites are subject to low exposure to EPC attempts, the increased frequency and duration of copulations during the fertile period suggests that, under pressure from the colonial breeding system, a higher rate of copulations is the most effective preventive mechanism against relative uncertainty of paternity.

[...] et al. Staphylococcus aureus {{is considered a}} commensal bacterium in animals and humans, but S. aureus carriage in wild animals has not been analysed. Swabs from skin and nasal samples (nares) were taken from <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon</b> vulture (n= 40 samples/ 40 animals), Iberian ibex (n= 260 samples / 157 animals), mouflon (n= 4 samples/ 2 animals), red deer (n= 544 samples/ 273 animals) and wild boar (n= 1395 samples/ 716 animals) and cultured on Baird-Parker agar with rabbit plasma fibrinogen;compatible colonies (one per sample) were confirmed by PCR. The presence of mecA and mecC genes and spa typing were performed in all isolates. In total, 247 isolates from 226 animals were recovered, the most of them from nasal samples (77. 23 %). Two isolates were mecA positive (0. 008 %). Sixty five spa types (including 27 new descriptions) were detected, the most frequent ones being t 3750 (n= 53), t 548 (n= 27) and t 528 (n= 18). Several spa types were mainly isolated from a particular animal species (98. 1 % and 94. 4 % of spa type t 3750 and t 528 isolates were from wild boars and Iberian ibex, respectively; the 66. 7 % of isolates spa type t 548 were from wild boar and 33. 3 % from red deer). These data suggested that some spa types could be host adapted. Both mecA-carrying isolates (t 127 and t 011) were from wild boars. Although the protocol applied was not specific {{for the detection of}} MRSA, this result points out the interest of monitoring MRSA in wildlife. Moreover, the detected MRSA genotypes are frequently associated with MRSA from livestock and humans, which could indicate contacts between different reservoirs. Further studies regarding bacterial dissemination are to be evaluated, including water as route of spreading from human and domestic habitats to wildlife. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Accelerometry {{has been}} used to {{identify}} behaviours through the quantification of body posture and motion for a range of species moving in different media. This technique has not been applied to flight behaviours to the same degree, having only been used to distinguish flapping from soaring flight, even though identifying the type of soaring flight could provide important insights into the factors underlying movement paths in soaring birds. This {{may be due to the}} complexities of interpreting acceleration data, as movement in the aerial environment may be influenced by phenomena such as centripetal acceleration (pulling-g). This study used high-resolution movement data on the flight of free-living Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) and a captive <b>Eurasian</b> <b>griffon</b> vulture (Gyps fulvus) to examine the influence of gravitational, dynamic and centripetal acceleration in different flight types. Flight behaviour was categorised as thermal soaring, slope soaring, gliding and flapping, using changes in altitude and heading from magnetometry data. We examined the ability of the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm to distinguish between these behaviours using acceleration data alone. 							Results: Values of the vectorial static body acceleration (VeSBA) suggest that these birds experience relatively little centripetal acceleration in flight, though this varies between flight types. Centripetal acceleration appears to be of most influence during thermal soaring; consequently, it is not possible to derive bank angle from smoothed values of lateral acceleration. In contrast, the smoothed acceleration values in the dorso-ventral axis provide insight into body pitch, which varied linearly with airspeed. Classification of passive flight types via KNN was limited, with low accuracy and precision for soaring and gliding. 							Conclusion: The importance of soaring was evident in the high proportion of time each bird spent in this flight mode (52. 17 – 84. 00 %). Accelerometry alone was limited in its ability to distinguish between passive flight types, though smoothed values in the dorso-ventral axis did vary with airspeed. Other sensors, in particular the magnetometer, provided powerful methods of identifying flight behaviour and these data may be better suited for automated behavioural identification. This should provide further insight into the type and strength of updraughts available to soaring birds. Fil: Williams, H. J [...] Swansea University; Reino UnidoFil: Shepard, E. L.
