40|$|It is {{certainly}} eagerness of every manufacturer {{to be able}} to look through a finished product without destroying it. Indeed, using modern technology within the application of some physical principles makes it possible to really travel inside the matter and see the invisible. Nondestructive inspection, <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>testing</b> and <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> evaluation are today recurrent terms in many fields from the high-tech development to the past footsteps conservation. This new book collects theories and practices for several different non-destructive inspection techniques, which {{is certainly}} a great advantage since it facilitates the user's choice, while it may be breeding ground for generating and promoting new ideas for a better exploitation of a specific technique...|$|R

The results of experimental campaign carried out on existing structures are discussed in order to investigate the variability of <b>Destructive</b> <b>Tests</b> (DTs) and <b>Non</b> <b>Destructive</b> <b>Tests</b> (NDTs). Then, the characteristics of the most usual procedures (core testing, rebound number, ultrasonic pulse, …) have been examined. The results showed primarily the unsuitability (thus its uselessness) of the rebound test in order to describe the variability of concrete characteristics inside the buildings. On this basis, an alternative procedure has been suggested to obtain in-situ concrete strength...|$|R
40|$|The proper {{planning}} of investigations before carrying out repair works is important if optimum use {{is to be}} made of the test data. A major step needs to be taken from knowing, for example, that chloride is present in the concrete, to select the best methods for repair. Engineers require guidance on both the techniques available for the condition assessment of structures and the methods for data interpretation. Two major stages are usually recommended for such an operation: the first stage is based on a rapid-scan visual assessment, often including limited sampling in areas obviously damaged, from which areas can be selected for more detailed investigations. The second stage contains a detailed diagnostic survey that relies on <b>destructive</b> and <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>testing</b> techniques. <b>Non</b> <b>destructive</b> techniques are more and more utilized not only for the evaluation of the concrete strength but also for the detection of cracks and delaminations. Moreover, the interest for techniques able to evaluate concrete permeability is rising, due to the importance of this factor for durability evaluation. The paper will discuss the assessment of concrete structures and describe the main destructive and non destructive techniques with regard to specific pathologies. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Repair of {{structures}} in concrete {{is still a}} challenge, especially when access and environment offer a difficult context such as the case of wharves. Concerning the repair of concrete for marine structures, European standards give the requirements in predefined and standardised conditions. However, repair of wharves is performed in harsh conditions such as access, humidity and operator position. These conditions do not enable the direct application of standards. By accounting for these requirements, the repair technique consists in rebuilding the concrete cover {{and in some cases}} using protective coating for some beams. In this paper, we focus on the concrete repair techniques. The aim of MAREO project (French project of the National competitive cluster in Civil Engineering and Eco-Building) is to compare several repair techniques carried out in the most complex area for repair: the tidal zone. The project deals with initial performance, sustainability, cost of durability and concrete properties monitoring by <b>destructive</b> <b>testing</b> (DT) and <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>testing</b> (NDT) techniques. The studied NDT techniques are: impact-echo, surface waves, multi-offset radar, and capacitive method. Both, beams placed in natural exposure and slabs specimens placed in accelerated conditions in laboratory are considered. For all the beams, the contaminated concrete was removed using high-velocity water jets (hydro-demolition). The selected techniques are wet shotcrete, dry shotcrete, formed concrete and manual repair. This paper focuses on the ability of NDT techniques to evaluate the changes of properties related to the chloride ingress in concrete both on site and in laboratory accelerated conditions. The interest of each technique and its sensitivity to several physical factors are highlighted. The need of NDT-combination is illustrated...|$|R

Consequently, the transmission measurement from array A to array C shows a defect at a bond position between 3 and 4  cm. The <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> shows a large defect in area a in this seam section. In the area b, the transmission measurement from the array B to the array C shows a defect at the position between 1.5 and 5  cm. Here too, the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> shows a significantly reduced amount of adhesive than in the following areas. However, the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> shows that test area c is filled with adhesive over the entire sample length.|$|R
40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{relatively}} new joining process that has exhibited many advantages over traditional arc welding processes, including greatly reducing distortion and eliminating solidification. The present work aims to determine the feasibility to weld two pieces of aluminum pipe by friction stir welding process and study the effect on the mechanical properties of welding joints. Special welding fixture fixed on conventional milling machine has been conducted to attempt this welding and group of welding parameters. Three tool rotational speeds (500, 630, 800 rpm) with four welding speeds (0. 5, 1, 2, 3 mm/sec) for each rotational speed had been used to study the effect of each parameters (tool rotation, weld speed) on mechanical and microstructure properties of welded joints. Mechanical properties of welded joints were investigated using different mechanical <b>tests</b> including <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> (visual inspection, X-ray) and <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> (tensile test, microhardeness and microstructure). Based on the stir welding experiments conducted in this study the results show that aluminum pipe (AA 6061 -T 6) can be welded by (FSW) process with a maximum welding efficiency (61. 7 %) in terms of ultimate tensile strength, using 630 (RPM) rotational speed, 1 (mm/sec) traveling speed...|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>testing</b> of {{concrete}} structures, several regulations propose correlations between cubic compressive strength and ultrasonic pulse velocity or pull out extraction force respectively. These correlations are expressed by means of coefficients derived from calibration through <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> carried out on cores. Aiming at evaluating the reliability of correlations in predicting concrete compressive strength, an experimental campaign has been started. Several concrete cubic specimens of different strength classes have been prepared and <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>tested.</b> Moreover, 16 cores have been extracted from the cubic specimens and ultrasonic and compressive tests {{have been carried out}} on them.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies with ultrasonic nondestructive testing and wood fiber composites. The problem {{of the study was}} to ascertain whether ultrasonic nondestructive testing can be used in place of <b>destructive</b> <b>testing</b> to obtain the modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the wood/agricultural material with comparable results. The uniqueness of this research is that it addressed the type of content (cornstalks and switchgrass) being used with the wood fibers and the type of adhesives (soybean-based) associated with the production of these composite materials;Two research questions were addressed in the study. The major objective was to determine if one can predict the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> MOE value based on the nondestructive test MOE value. The population of the study was wood/agricultural fiberboards made from wood fibers, cornstalks, and switchgrass bonded together with soybean-based, urea-formaldehyde, and phenol-formaldehyde adhesives;Correlational analysis was used to determine if there was a relationship between the two tests. Regression analysis was performed to determine a prediction equation for the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> MOE value. Data were collected on both procedures using ultrasonic nondestructing testing and 3 -point destructive testing;The results produced a simple linear regression model for this study which was adequate in the prediction of destructive MOE values if the nondestructive MOE value is known. An approximation very close to the entire error in the model equation was explained from the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> MOE values for the composites. The nondestructive MOE values used to produce a linear regression model explained 83 % of the variability in the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> MOE values. The study also showed that, for the particular <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> values obtained with the equipment used, the model associated with the study is as good as it could be due to the variability in the results from the destructive tests;In this study, an ultrasonic signal was used to determine the MOE values on nondestructive tests. Future research studies could use the same or other hardboards to examine how the resins affect the ultrasonic signal...|$|R

40|$|Stone decay is {{affected}} by the influence of climatic factors. In particular marble degradation, that could be expressed by decohesion and /or bowing, is mainly due to the action of temperature and water (rains and relative humidity). In this work <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> and <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed to evaluate the decay of marble slabs subjected both to natural exposition and to artificial ageing tests (Lab - Bow test). Measurements of Ultrasonic Pulse Velocities (UPV) and bowing have been executed periodically on marble slabs exposed for a period of four years as preliminary field tests. On the base of this work an integrated test methodology to monitoring and previewing the behaviour of faÃ§ade slabs have been set up. The methodology has been applied on the marble faÃ§ade of modern building of centre Italy and consists of in situ and laboratory tests. In laboratory a <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> (flexural strength) has been added to the <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> to evaluate the decay before and after cycles of an ageing test.

40|$|A {{research}} on the testing of concrete elasticity {{has been done in}} order to measure concrete compressive strength using a <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> based on sonic wave velocity. An equipment that was used for this research was a Sonic Wave Analyzer (SOWAN). In this research, concrete samples were formed in cylindrical shape with 15 cm diameter and 30 cm length. The compressive strengths of this concrete were 19, 23, and 25 (⁄). After that the time delay of sonic wave was measured. The research results showed that primary and secondary sonic wave velocity, elasticity, and compressive strenght were = 3525 m/s, = 1950 m/s, 23240 x N/, and 24 x (⁄) respectively. Based on the data, it was concluded that this <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> based on sonic wave velocity can be used to measure the concrete compressive strength, because the values obtained were comparable to the values obtained using the Universal Testing Machine (UTM) which is a <b>destructive</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} {{applied in the}} industrial context for their strong potentialities in improving and standardizing quality control.

However, the raw data coming from <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> systems are not always immediately suitable for sophisticated defect detection algorithms, due to noise and disturbances which are unavoidable, especially in harsh operating conditions, {{such as the ones}} which are typical of the steelmaking cycle.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of an oxide core <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> {{program at the}} Spert I reactor facility are reviewed. The proposed experimental program of <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> on a low-enriched oxide core, the experimental results of nondestructive transient tests that were obtained on the test core and the extrapolation of these results to the destructive case, {{an analysis of the}} hazards involved in performing such <b>destructive</b> <b>tests,</b> and {{a detailed description of the}} reactor facility and environmental conditions are presented. The supervision and control of personnel during and after each <b>destructive</b> <b>test,</b> and of the plans for reentry, cleanup, and restoration of the facility are discussed. The water- moderated core that will be used for these experiments is mounted in the Spert I open-type reactor vessel, which has no provision for pressurization or forced coolant flow. The core is comprised of approximately 600 4 %-enriched UO/sub 2 / fuel rods clad with stainless steel, and four blade-type, gang-operated control rods for reactor control. Reactor transients are initiated at ambient temperature by step-insertions of reactivity, using for this purpose a special control rod that can be quickly ejected from the core. On the basis of the results obtained from previous nondestructivelkinetic tests, an analysis was made to determine the nature of the results to be expected for an assumed 1. 8 - sec- period test in which tetal core destruction occurs. An evaluation of hazards involved in conducting the 1. 8 -msec test, based on conservative assumptions regarding fission product release and weather conditions, indicated that with the procedural controls normally exercised in the conduct of any transient test at Spert and the special controls to be in effect during the <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> series, no significant hazard to personnel or to the general public will be incurred.
