50|$|Most modern {{production}} automobile engines use a {{timing belt}} or chain to synchronize crankshaft and camshaft rotation; some engines instead use gears to directly drive the camshafts. The {{use of a}} timing belt or chain instead of <b>direct</b> <b>gear</b> drive enables engine designers to place the camshaft(s) further from the crankshaft, and in engines with multiple camshafts a timing belt or chain also enables the camshafts to be placed further from each other. Timing chains were common on production automobiles through the 1970s and 1980s, when timing belts became the norm, but timing chains have seen a resurgence in recent years. Timing chains are generally more durable than timing belts - though neither is as durable as <b>direct</b> <b>gear</b> drive - however, timing belts are lighter, less expensive, and operate more quietly.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Torsional finite {{elements}} for <b>direct,</b> <b>geared,</b> branched and grounded connections are presented. For a simple three-degrees-of-freedom powertrain model the {{finite elements}} are defmed {{and the global}} system assembly is detailed. The appropriateness of the finite element method for powertrain systems is illustrated via examples for modelling manual, automatic and continuously variable transmissions. The use of custom elements is discussed for an element for toroid-roller contact and for a two-stage planetary gear set. A test rig is presented and model verification is discussed. 1...|$|R

50|$|Sports {{cars are}} also often {{equipped}} with manual transmissions because they offer more direct driver involvement and better performance, {{though this is}} changing as many automakers move to faster dual-clutch transmissions, which are generally shifted with paddles located behind the steering wheel. For example, the 991 Porsche 911 GT3 uses Porsche's PDK. Off-road vehicles and trucks often feature manual transmissions because they allow <b>direct</b> <b>gear</b> selection and are often more rugged than their automatic counterparts.|$|E
50|$|Less complex drive system: OHV engines have a {{less complex}} drive {{system for the}} {{camshaft}} when compared with OHC engines. Most OHC engines drive the camshaft or camshafts using a timing belt, a chain, or multiple chains. These systems {{require the use of}} tensioners which add complexity. In contrast, an OHV engine has the camshaft positioned close to the crankshaft which may be driven by a much shorter chain or even <b>direct</b> <b>gear</b> connection. However, this is somewhat negated by a more complex valvetrain requiring pushrods.|$|E
5000|$|Gear or chain {{systems are}} also used to connect the {{crankshaft}} to the camshaft at the correct timing. However, gears and shafts constrain the relative location of the crankshaft and camshafts. Even where the crankshaft and camshaft(s) are very close together, as in pushrod engines, most engine designers use a short chain drive rather than a <b>direct</b> <b>gear</b> drive. This is because gear drives suffer from frequent torque reversal as the cam profiles [...] "kick back" [...] against the drive from the crank, leading to excessive noise and wear. Fibre or nylon covered gears, with more resilience, are often used instead of steel gears where direct drive is used. Commercial engines and aircraft engines use steel gears only, as a fibre or nylon coated gear can fail suddenly and without warning.|$|E
50|$|Kahler's success {{allowed him}} {{to build a new}} factory in New Albany in 1910. The factory had its own power plant, {{generating}} its own electricity. The plant featured highly efficient, <b>direct</b> <b>geared</b> electric motors at each work station instead of the then common practice of using belt driven tools powered by overhead shafts. The Kahler Co. plant had its own dry-kiln and a long rail siding, allowing both inbound and outbound freight to be handled under cover. His rail siding was connected to a rail line that carried freight for four railroad companies allowing Kahler great flexibility in shipping.|$|R

50|$|Original {{specifications}} for the Amazon included the new Volvo B16 engine, a 3-speed manual gearbox (H6) and rear-wheel drive. In 1958 the sport model, Amazon Sport, was released {{and later the}} same year the Amazon became the first series produced car with a three-point safety belt in the front seats as standard. In 1962, Volvo introduced a two-door version, a five-door wagon, and the new B18 engine, deleting two-tone paint and upholstery. In 1965 the Amazon color-coordinated embossed vinyl upholstery and door panels became available. The new gearbox selections were the three-speed M30 (briefly offered with an automatic electric clutch), the four-speed M40 and the M41 with four-speed and overdrive. The M31 gearbox was also introduced in 1961 but was only available that year (a three-speed fully synchronized gearbox with overdrive on both second and third <b>direct</b> <b>gears).</b> Gearbox options on the 121 were the M30, M31 and M40 while gearbox options on the 122S were the M40 and M41 gearboxes. In 1964 the Borg-Warner BW35 three-speed automatic transmission also became available on the four-door and two-door. From 1967 to 1968 the BW35 was also available on the five-door wagon.|$|R

Beaching again on the 13th, the tank landing ship, helped by Army engineers, started to unload the remainder of her own cargo, and her crew completed the job on the 14th. Over the ensuing weeks, LST-356 voyaged thrice to Sicilian ports bringing supplies into Scoglitti, Gela, and Palermo.

During that period of inactivity, enemy planes appeared overhead, and the tank landing ship’s gunners joined in the fire to drive them off.|$|R
50|$|The {{top gear}} of the gearbox is {{achieved}} without these gears, but by coupling the driven shaft {{directly to the}} driving shaft through another dog clutch.

A typical gearbox had 2% losses in each gear set, so 4% for intermediate ranges through their two gears, but approaching 0% for the direct-drive top <b>gear.</b> As the <b>direct</b> top <b>gear</b> is not transmitting torque through the gears, it is also quieter.|$|R
