50|$|Higher {{concentration}} ratio values can be attained by using large apertures and small receiver. Receiver temperature increases {{with the increase}} in {{concentration ratio}}, as shown in Figure 2. Concentration ratios vary from 1.5 to 3000 {{depending on the type of}} collector, i.e., whether it is a medium- or <b>high-temperature</b> <b>collector.</b> This is an important parameter in determining the efficiency of a solar plant.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} an ultrahigh-temperature solar {{electric}} heat-engine converter is examined in which an alkali plasma would serve as both the <b>high-temperature</b> <b>collector</b> of solar radiation and as the working fluid for a high-temperature working cycle. The working cycle would be a simple magnetohydrodynamic Rankine cycle. Theoretical and experimental results obtained to date are summarized. These include: (1) an experimental confirmation of the theoretical prediction that a plasma temperature of about 2800 K can be reached through heating cesium vapor by sunlight concentrated to approximately 300 W per sq cm; and (2) {{the establishment of a}} theoretical model of the complete solar heated plasma magnetohydrodynamic cycle...|$|E
25|$|Solar thermal {{collectors}} {{are classified}} by the United States Energy Information Administration as low-, medium-, or <b>high-temperature</b> <b>collectors.</b> Low-temperature collectors are generally unglazed {{and used to}} heat swimming pools or to heat ventilation air. Medium-temperature collectors are also usually flat plates but are used for heating water or air for residential and commercial use. <b>High-temperature</b> <b>collectors</b> concentrate sunlight using mirrors or lenses and are generally used for fulfilling heat requirements up to 300 deg C / 20 bar pressure in industries, and for electric power production. Two categories include Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) for fulfilling heat requirements in industries, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) when the heat collected is used for power generation. CST and CSP are not replaceable in terms of application. The largest facilities {{are located in the}} American Mojave Desert of California and Nevada. These plants employ a variety of different technologies. The largest examples include, Ivanpah Solar Power Facility (377MW), Solar Energy Generating Systems installation (354MW), and Crescent Dunes (110MW). Spain is the other major developer of solar thermal power plant. The largest examples include, Solnova Solar Power Station (150MW), the Andasol solar power station (150MW), and Extresol Solar Power Station (100MW).|$|R
50|$|Many {{collectors}} {{cannot be}} moved, for example <b>high-temperature</b> <b>collectors</b> where the energy is recovered as hot liquid or gas (e.g. steam). Other examples include direct heating and lighting of buildings and fixed in-built solar cookers, such as Scheffler reflectors. In such cases {{it is necessary}} to employ a moving mirror so that, regardless of where the Sun is positioned in the sky, the Sun's rays are redirected onto the collector.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{the issues}} of {{development}} of <b>high-temperature</b> solar <b>collectors</b> have been discussed. The structure of a newly-developed solar collector, {{as well as the}} design parameters of its components and the results of experiments has been described. Collectors of this class are a core part of self-sustained energy supply system for rural buildings and settlements. The newly-designed solar collector is capable to store intensively heat energy in periods of solar energy in excess to the demand and to supply heat and generated electricity in periods when solar energy income is insufficient and collector alone can not sustain system operation. The newly-designed solar collector {{is an integral part of}} the entire energy supply system of self-sustained buildings. The energy produced by collector is consumed in the systems of hot water supply, heating, air conditioning, cooling and electric power supply...|$|R
40|$|The EUV source {{output power}} and the {{collector}} optics lifetime {{have been identified as}} critical key issues for EUV lithography. In order to meet these requirements a heated collector concept was realized for the first time. An ellipsoidal collector Substrate with an outer diameter of 320 mm was coated with a laterally graded high-temperature multilayer. The interface-engineered Mo/Si multilayer coating was optimized in terms of high peak reflectivity at 13. 5 nm and a working temperature of 400 °C. Barrier layers were introduced on both interfaces to block thermally induced interdiffusion processes of molybdenum and silicon to provide long-term optical stability of the multilayer at elevated temperatures. A normal-incidence reflectance of more than 40 % at 13. 55 nm was measured after heating. After initial annealing at 400 °C for one hour, no degradation of the optical properties of these multilayer coatings occurred during both long-term heating tests for up to 100 hours and multiple annealing cycles. The successful realization of this <b>high-temperature</b> sub-aperture <b>collector</b> mirror represents a major step towards the implementation of the heated collector concept and illustrates the great potential of high-temperature EUV multilayer coatings...|$|R

[91] {{carried out}} a {{detailed}} theoretical research by using MWCNT, Al 2 O 3, CuO, SiO 2, and TiO 2 nanofluids with PG (propylene glycol)–water (20 : 80) base fluid in a <b>high-temperature</b> U-tube solar <b>collector.</b> They observed the collector efficiency of the solar collector efficiency has distinctly positive correlation with thermal conductivity of nanoparticles added since {{it is in the}} sequence from greatest to least: MWCNT, CuO, Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, and SiO 2 nanofluids. They also analyzed the emission reduction of CO 2 and SO 2 as well as the electricity and energy consumption worldwide. Their results support that nanofluids has great potential for energy saving and emission reduction. Due to their theoretical results have not considered the dispersion situation of different nanofluids, the actual performance is needed to be experimentally verified.|$|R
40|$|Solar {{heating and}} cooling (SHC) systems are {{currently}} under rapid development and deployment due to their potential to reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector. Absorption chiller technology (traditionally powered by natural gas in large buildings) can be retrofitted to run fully, or in part, on solar energy. The majority of solar absorption chillers installed {{around the world are}} based on single-effect chillers and low-temperature solar thermal collectors. Benefiting from higher coefficients of performance (COPs), multi-effect absorption chillers can operate more efficiently than single-effect chillers when coupled with <b>high-temperature</b> solar thermal <b>collectors,</b> thereby requiring less solar thermal energy (and potentially less collector area) to supply a given amount of cooling. Although multi-effect absorption chillers have been on the market for a while, experimental testing, standardization, and systematic comparative investigations of their performance and viability are lacking in the literature. In fact, there has been no comprehensive comparison between solar-assisted single-, double-, and triple-effect absorption chillers against a common set of energetic, economic, and environmental metrics from a holistic perspective. Motivated by this research gap, this thesis aims to systematically investigate the techno-economic feasibility of this technology, incorporating realistic, optimized configurations to supply air-conditioning (both cooling and heating) demand for large buildings. This analysis is based on coupling LiBr-H 2 O single-, double-, and triple-effect absorption chillers with solar thermal collectors. Based on manufacturer rated performance curves for real chiller and collector products on the market, simulation models of each SHC absorption chiller configuration with different design options are developed in a transient system simulation environment (TRNSYS 17). Different control scenarios and operational modes of the system are proposed and investigated in order to identify the optimum control logics and designs for these systems. To achieve the highest primary energy savings, a detailed evaluation of alternative backup options is conducted – a subject that has been rarely discussed in the literature. It was found that due to the complexity of these types of system, the present numerous non-intuitive design choices must be analyzed to achieve the best techno-economic performance in these systems. In addition, a parametric study of the proposed SHC configurations is performed to investigate the effect of key design variables such as the storage tank volume and the solar collector area on the plants’ performance. Furthermore, this dissertation takes a unique, comprehensive perspective by investigating the impact of characteristic solar beam radiation to global radiation ratios {{on the size of the}} solar field of the proposed SHC plants for a wide variety of climatic conditions. The occupant thermal comfort and the influence of the latent loads on the system performance are also discussed. A detailed multi-objective optimization model using a genetic algorithm is formulated to optimize the performance of the most promising configurations of SHC absorption chillers by minimizing their primary energy consumption and total levelized cost simultaneously. This provides a clear comparison of the energy, environmental, and economic performance of the best alternative configurations at their optimal designs. Finally, experimental tests were conducted on a solar cooling double-effect chiller prototype to gain insight into the real-world performance of multi-effect chillers when coupled with high-temperature concentrating solar thermal collectors. Overall, this thesis provides clear techno-economic guidance/advice on energy-efficient, sustainable and cost-effective design of SHC absorption chiller systems for air-conditioning applications, thereby providing a pathway to greater utilization of this technology. The findings of this research will also contribute to the International Energy Agency (IEA) SHC Program Task 48 (Quality Assurance and Support Measures for Solar Cooling Systems), whose main objective is to assist with developing a strong and sustainable market for solar thermally-driven cooling and heating systems – a subject that has not been studied prior to other IEA SHC Tasks...|$|R
