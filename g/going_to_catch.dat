500|$|Will Ferrell's {{performance}} received {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Rob Sheffield called his performance [...] "pure magic", while Miles McNutt {{said that his}} scenes were a [...] "momentum killer". Cindy White criticized the writers for waiting for Ferrell's second-to last episode to give his character a [...] "juicy quirk". Soon after the episode's airdate, the series received publicity for a possible storyline featuring Phyllis as Erin's birth mother. The rumor was started during an interview with executive producer Greg Daniels with Entertainment Weekly in which he stated [...] "A tiny mystery story – which I'm not sure anyone’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> and will come out a few episodes from now – is being set up here". This was further explored in the seventh season finale, [...] "Search Committee", where it was proven false.|$|E
500|$|Dupotet {{attempted}} {{to throw off}} Amethysts pursuit during the night by turning westwards once more, but Seymour anticipated this manoeuvre and turned his ship westwards as well, discovering Niémen {{only a few miles}} ahead at 21:40. Rapidly gaining on the French ship, Seymour began firing his bow-chasers, small guns situated in the bows of the frigate, in an attempt to damage her rigging so that he could bring his broadsides to bear. Dupotet responded with his stern-chasers, but by 01:00 on 6 April it was clear that Amethyst was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> the French frigate. The pursuit had been exhausting: since first sighting the British ships, Niémen had travelled over [...] and was just [...] from the Spanish coast when she was caught. At 01:15, Amethyst opened fire, Niémen immediately responding and turning to the northeast in an attempt to shake off the British ship. Seymour followed his opponent and at 01:45 was again close enough to engage, the frigates firing upon one another from close range for over an hour.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{script was}} {{initially}} 75 pages long, 10 pages {{too long to}} stay within the episode's time slot; this led to several cuts, a common problem for episodes of the series according to writer, B. J. Novak. The script received several laughs from the cast and producers specifically for lines read by Creed Bratton and Kathy Bates. [...] "Search Committee" [...] {{was one of the first}} episodes not to feature former Office lead actor Steve Carell; the feeling during filming was [...] "weird" [...] according to Lieberstein. Carell's departure made it possible for more scenes with secondary characters, and also allowed for the [...] "very long group scene", described as [...] "observational and conversational" [...] by Novak. The episode features a storyline hinted in [...] "Goodbye, Michael" [...] in which it is hinted that Phyllis is Erin's birth mother. The rumor was started during an interview with executive producer Greg Daniels with Entertainment Weekly in which he stated [...] "A tiny mystery story – which I'm not sure anyone’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> and will come out a few episodes from now – is being set up here".|$|E

He was thinking {{of what he had}} found out up in the Green Forest that morning--that Paddy the Beaver was living there. Old Man Coyote's thoughts seemed very pleasant to himself, though really they were very dreadful thoughts.

2500|$|About.com's Deb Aoki listed Cowa! as the [...] "Best New All Ages Manga" [...] of 2008, {{calling it}} [...] "clever and charming enough to {{entertain}} adults {{as well as}} younger readers." [...] Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger disagreed, claiming the plot is not complex enough to appeal to adults. He also wished Viz would have kept the other few chapters that were originally colored as such instead of just the first, as those particular ones were hard to follow in black and white. However, he wrote that [...] "Makoleen's character elevates {{what might have been}} a simple children's adventure to a gentle fable about acceptance and understanding." [...] and praised the humor. A.E. Sparrow of IGN gave the series an 8.6 out of 10 and referred to it as a [...] "self-contained mini-epic." [...] On the humor he said [...] "the jokes come at you unapologetically and you're either <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> them or write them off." [...] Viz Media's English release of Cowa! was nominated in the [...] "Best Publication for Kids" [...] category at the 2009 Eisner Awards.|$|E
2500|$|According to Marcus, [...] "For {{the first}} of his two {{appearances}} that night, as a performer Elvis had come on dressed in grandma's nightgown and nightcap." [...] Concerning the singer's second set in the show, the author adds that there were [...] "Elvis, Scotty Moore on guitar, Bill Black on stand-up bass, D. J. Fontana on drums, three Jordanaires on their feet, one at a piano. They were shown from behind; the camera pulled all the way back. They went into 'Ready Teddy.' It was Little Richard's most thrilling record", however, [...] "there was no way Elvis was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> him, but he didn’t have to—the song is a wave and he rode it. Compared to moments on the Dorsey shows, on the Berle show, it was ice cream—Elvis's face unthreatening, his legs as if in casts ..." [...] When [...] "he sang Little Richard's 'Reddy Teddy' and began to move and dance, the camera pulled in, so that the television audience saw him from the waist up only." ...|$|E

500|$|A gifted, slick-fielding {{defensive}} first baseman, in 3 of {{his first}} 21 games he made spectacular catches of foul pop-ups, bracing himself against the railing {{in front of the}} first base dugout, and then flipping over the railing as he caught the ball. [...] The [...] Davis said: [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> any ball I can. I've got long arms, I guess.

5000|$|Even ASCII art is subtle {{enough to}} show the left end above a little farther from the nearest other line player of the same team than is the right end. Such a slight {{additional}} gap {{is said to be}} [...] "flexing" [...] that end, but does not produce an additional position name. However, when the gap is considerably greater, that {{is said to be a}} [...] "split end" [...] (SE). That produced a position name when on offense a team played with one end split and the other not split—a [...] "tight end" [...] (TE). The split end being specialized for <b>going</b> downfield <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> forward passes, it becomes more useful to differentiate the split from the tight end than between left and right end.|$|R
2500|$|On February 16, 1978, Duty and Anthony Trombitas, {{whom he had}} met {{about four}} to five days earlier, robbed the Jiffy Mart {{convenience}} store on Falcon Road in Altus, {{north of the border}} with Texas. During the robbery, which netted some beer and money, ranging in various accounts from $7.66 to $18, the two men abducted store clerk Linda Hall (no relation). After driving her to a barn in Tillman County, Duty raped Hall and shot her {{in the back of the}} head three times with a [...]22 caliber pistol. Trombitas then hit her with a stick, which Duty identified as a broom handle. Though left for dead, Hall was able to walk a mile (1.6km) to a house for help and recovered at Tillman County Memorial Hospital. The two men drove off to Frederick, then Electra, and proceeded to Fort Worth. Upon hearing a radio report about her on the next day, Duty said, [...] "I was surprised that she was still alive." [...] Duty returned to Altus the following month, presuming that law enforcement officers were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up with him anyway. He was arrested on the street after calling the police and hanging up from a payphone at another Jiffy Mart near the downtown square.|$|E

Once the plane was approaching the British coast, they drew their guns and grenades and approached the cockpit, demanding entrance. According to Khaled, {{in an interview in}} 2000,"So half an hour (after take off) we had to move. We stood up. I had my two hand grenades and I showed everybody I was taking the pins out with my teeth. Patrick stood up. We heard shooting just the same minute and when we crossed the first class, people were shouting but I didn't see who was shooting because it was behind us. So Patrick told me 'go forward I protect your back.' So I went and then he found a hostess and she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> me round the legs. So I rushed, reached to the cockpit, it was closed. [...] So I was screaming 'open the door.' Then the hostess came; she said 'she has two hand grenades,' but they did not open (the cockpit door) and suddenly I was threatening to blow up the plane. I was saying 'I will count and if you don't open I will blow up the plane.'" ...|$|E
