500|$|The land {{upon which}} Ashlawn stands was {{originally}} {{part of a}} [...] parcel purchased by Joshua Perkins' grandfather Joseph Perkins and great-great uncle Jacob Perkins. The town of Lisbon, Connecticut, was originally known as Newent, the name believed to derive from the Perkins' place in Gloucestershire, England. Joseph Perkins' father, Captain Matthew Perkins, was a prominent farmer {{and founder of the}} Hanover Society in 1761. Matthew Perkins held approximately [...] in Hanover and owned three slaves as part of his assets; he died in 1773. Joshua Perkins is believed to have deeded the land. Joshua Perkins, the eldest son of Matthew Perkins, was born in 1740. A farmer and a selectman, he served in 1786 and 1787 before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> in the Connecticut state legislature in 1789 and again in 1801. In 1825, he deeded , containing the house, to his son Charles Perkins. Joshua Perkins died in 1833, living to be 93.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Governor Bob Taft {{was convicted}} of four counts of failing to file {{accurate}} financial disclosure statements but {{said he would not}} resign his office despite the conviction, which grew out of the Coingate scandal exposed by The Toledo Blade. [...] Johnson, who would become governor if Taft resigned, told The Plain Dealer [...] "You don't take this appointment and go through the confirmation process without knowing that you're prepared. [...] But I don't expect it" [...] and said he had not spoken to Taft about becoming governor. [...] Johnson was by The Columbus Dispatch that [...] "It's not gonna happen.

2500|$|Theodora was {{followed}} by two failures. In 1885, in homage to Victor Hugo, who had died a few months earlier, she staged one of his older plays, Marion Delorme, written in 1831, but the play was outdated and her role did not {{give her a chance}} to show her talents. She next put on Hamlet, with her lover Philippe Garnier in the leading role and Bernhardt in the relatively minor role of Ophelia. The critics and audiences were not impressed, and the play was unsuccessful. Bernhardt had built up large expenses, which included a 10,000 francs a month allowance paid to her son Maurice, a passionate gambler. Bernhardt was forced to sell her chalet in Saint-Addresse and her mansion on rue Fortuny, and part of her collection of animals. Her impresario, Edouard Jarrett, immediately proposed she make another world tour, this time to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chili, Peru, Panama, Cuba, and Mexico, then on to Texas, New York, England, Ireland, and Scotland. She was on tour for 15 months, from early 1886 until late 1887. On the eve of departure, she told a French reporter: [...] "I passionately love this life of adventures. I detest knowing in advance what they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> at my dinner, and I detest a hundred thousand times more knowing what will happen to me, for better or worse. I adore the unexpected." ...|$|E

60|$|The turnkey {{had strong}} private {{opinions}} {{as to what}} would become of poor Tip, and had even gone so far with the view of averting their fulfilment, as to sound Tip {{in reference to the}} expediency of running away and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> his country.

60|$|It was charmin to {{hear this}} pair of raskles talkin about HONOR.

6000|$|The {{young man}} {{did as he}} was told, and {{everything}} happened as the woman had said. He took the robe of feathers from the dove, who gave him in exchange for it a ring, a collar, and one of its own plumes, saying: 'When you are in any trouble, cry [...] "Come to my aid, O dove!" [...] I am the daughter of the king you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve,</b> who hates your father and made you gamble in order to cause your ruin.' ...|$|E
60|$|Again Captain Davenport {{consulted}} McCoy and the chart. Makemo lay seventy-five {{miles to}} the southwest. Its lagoon was thirty miles long, and its entrance was excellent. When Captain Davenport gave his orders, the crew refused duty. They announced that they {{had had enough of}} hell fire under their feet. There was the land. What if the ship could not make it? They could make it in the boats. Let her burn, then. Their lives amounted to something to them. They had served faithfully the ship, now they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> themselves.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's the {{greatest}} {{mistake in the}} world to think that one needs money to bring up a family.

She's to be apprenticed to a dressmaker, aren't you, Sally? And the boys are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> their country.

6000|$|The {{next day}} Myles and Gascoyne were {{throwing}} their daggers for a wager at a wooden target {{against the wall}} back of the armorer's smithy. Wilkes, Gosse, {{and one or two}} others of the squires were sitting on a bench looking on, and now and then applauding a more than usually well-aimed cast of the knife. Suddenly that impish little page spoken of before, Robin Ingoldsby, thrust his shock head {{around the corner of the}} smithy, and said: [...] "Ho, Falworth! Blunt is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> thee out to-day, and I myself heard him say so. He says he is going to slit thine ears." [...] And then he was gone as suddenly as he had appeared.|$|E

The other magistrates congregated round; but James Frost and Sydney Calcott had slipped past, to the piano where Lady Conway had sent Miss Calcott and Isabel. 'Why did not Fitzjocelyn, come too?' was murmured by the young group in the recess opposite the door; and when at last he became visible, leaning against the wall, listening to the Squire, Virginia declared he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> them just as he used at Beauchastel.|$|E
60|$|Why did he {{not happen}} to meet Wakem? The want of that {{coincidence}} vexed him, and set his mind at work in an irritating way. Perhaps Wakem was gone out of town to-day on purpose to avoid seeing or hearing anything of an honorable action which might well cause him some unpleasant twinges. If Wakem were to meet him then, Mr. Tulliver would look straight at him, and the rascal would perhaps be forsaken a little by his cool, domineering impudence. He would know by and by that an honest man was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> him any longer, and lend his honesty to fill a pocket already over-full of dishonest gains. Perhaps the luck was beginning to turn; perhaps the Devil didn't always hold the best cards in this world.|$|E
