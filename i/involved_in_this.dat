5|$|Allen Lanier, Joe Bouchard and Donald Roeser contributed {{instrumental}} {{parts and}} backing vocals to the tracks as guests. These remain Lanier's and J. Bouchard's only contributions to Imaginos. Columbia Records' complaints about Albert Bouchard's lead vocals pushed him to finance multiple recordings with try-outs of singers, including Jon Rogers and Joey Cerisano, whose performances on some songs {{were used for}} the final mix of the album in 1988. The new recordings, overdubs by other uncredited musicians, and mixing lasted until 1984. Musicians <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> second phase of recording included future BÖC keyboard player Tommy Zvoncheck, who had already played with Clarence Clemons, Public Image Ltd and The Dream Syndicate.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{bombardment}} of Kagoshima, the Satsuma domain had become {{closer to the}} British and was pursuing the modernization of its army and navy with their support. The Scottish dealer Thomas Blake Glover sold quantities of warships and guns to the southern domains. American and British military experts, usually former officers, may have been directly <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> military effort. The British ambassador Harry Smith Parkes supported the anti-Shogunate forces in a drive to establish a legitimate, unified Imperial rule in Japan, and to counter French influence with the Shogunate. During that period, southern Japanese leaders such as Saigō Takamori of Satsuma, or Itō Hirobumi and Inoue Kaoru of Chōshū cultivated personal connections with British diplomats, notably Ernest Mason Satow.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{transfer}} to the Army, the Chinooks were used in similar roles to those they had undertaken in RAAF service. The first operational deployment of the Army Chinooks began in October 1997, when two of the helicopters and three Black Hawks which were in Papua New Guinea {{as part of a}} training exercise were tasked with delivering food supplies to the highlands of the country following a severe drought. The Chinooks were also used to transport fuel supplies for the other ADF aircraft and helicopters <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> effort. At this time, the deployment of two Chinooks was the largest the Army could undertake as the other helicopters were undergoing maintenance or were needed for training purposes. The Chinooks returned to Australia in March 1998.|$|E
5|$|In December 1944 the United States Navy's {{high command}} became {{concerned}} that the IJN would attempt to cut the supply line to the planned beachhead at Lingayen Gulf. On 26 December a Japanese naval force operating from Cam Ranh Bay in Japanese-controlled French Indochina shelled the Allied beachhead at Mindoro, but inflicted no damage. One of the Japanese destroyers <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> operation was sunk, {{and all of the}} remaining ships were damaged by Allied air and naval attacks before returning to Cam Ranh Bay.|$|E

Japanese pilots reported to Nagumo that a second aerial attack on Midway's defenses would be necessary if troops were to go ashore by 7 June.|$|E

5|$|Possibly as {{a result}} of Eystein's activities, King David granted half of Caithness to Harald's cousin, Erlend Haraldsson. The result, as recounted in the Orkneyinga Saga, was a {{political}} struggle which ended with Erlend's murder in 1154. Rognvald too was killed, in 1158. Svein Asleifsson was again heavily <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> dynastic conflict. In 1153 King David died, to be succeeded by his young grandson, Malcolm IV. King Eystein too died in a war with his brothers Ingi and Sigurd which left Ingi the sole surviving son of Harald Gilli. As a result, by 1158 Harald Maddadsson was undisputed Earl of Orkney, with neither the King of Scots nor the King of Norway in any position to contest his power.|$|E

5|$|The Mysore {{painting}} {{style is}} {{an offshoot of}} the Vijayanagar school of painting, and King Raja Wodeyar (1578–1617 CE) is credited with having been its patron. The distinctive feature of these paintings is the gesso work, to which gold foil is applied. Mysore is known for rosewood inlay work; around 4,000 craftsmen were estimated to be <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> art in 2002. The city lends its name to the Mysore silk saree, a women's garment made with pure silk and gold zari (thread). Mysore Peta, the traditional indigenous turban worn by the erstwhile rulers of Mysore, is worn by men in some traditional ceremonies. A notable local dessert that traces its history to the kitchen in the Mysore palace is Mysore pak.|$|E
5|$|The Ptolemaic dynasty had {{initiated}} Greco-Roman {{maritime trade}} contact with India using the Red Sea ports. The Roman historian Strabo mentions a vast increase in trade following the Roman annexation of Egypt, indicating that monsoon was known and manipulated for trade in his time. By {{the time of}} Augustus up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from Myos Hormos to India, trading in a diverse variety of goods. Arsinoe, Berenice Troglodytica and Myos Hormos were the principal Roman ports <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> maritime trading network, while the Indian ports included Barbaricum, Barygaza, Muziris and Arikamedu.|$|E

The Macedonians and their allies plundered and looted Attica before attacking Athens. The invaders made it as far as the Academy of Athens when the Roman ambassadors in the city ordered the Macedonians to retreat or to face war with Rome.|$|E

5|$|After the {{completion}} of Kanon, the Key staff started production on Air and expanded {{the number of people}} <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> project compared to Kanon. The executive producer for Air was Takahiro Baba from VisualArt's, the publishing company that Key is under. The planning for Air was headed by Jun Maeda who was also one of two main scenario writers, the other being Takashi Ishikawa. Scenario assistance was provided by four more people: Kazuki Fujii, Kai, Tōya Okano, and Yūichi Suzumoto. Art direction was headed by Key's artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design. Further computer graphics were split between three people—Miracle Mikipon, Na-Ga, and Shinory—and background art was provided by Din and Torino. The music in the game was composed primarily by Shinji Orito, Jun Maeda, and Magome Togoshi, who had started working with Key since before Kanons release. After {{the completion}} of Air, two of the staff—Kazuki Fujii, and Takashi Ishikawa—left Key.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conservation}} {{concern was}} made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided {{it was not necessary}} to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.|$|E
5|$|Following {{this the}} unit became {{involved}} in largely defensive operations as the 1st Special Service Brigade dug in. Nevertheless they kept up {{the pressure on the}} Germans by carrying out offensive patrols, small scale raids and sniping. In mid-July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. No. 3 Commando was <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> advance, moving to Varaville where they caught up with the German rearguard and proceeded to clear the village. The advance continued into the following month and on 19 August they were ordered to seize the high ground to the north of Dozule. Attacking at night, the brigade advanced with No. 3 Commando leading the main body behind the vanguard and was able to infiltrate the German positions before the lead sections ran into the German headquarters units.|$|E

5|$|From 1963 to 1965, MRD was not {{directly}} involved in Formula One, and often ran works cars in other formulae. A separate company, Jack Brabham's Brabham Racing Organisation, ran the Formula One works entry. Like other customers, BRO bought its cars from MRD, initially at £3,000 per car, although it did not pay for development parts. Tauranac was unhappy with his distance from the Formula One operation and before the 1966 season suggested {{that he was no}} longer interested in producing cars for Formula One under this arrangement. Brabham investigated other chassis suppliers for BRO, however the two reached an agreement and from 1966 MRD was much more closely <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> category. After Jack Brabham sold his shares in MRD to Ron Tauranac at the end of 1969, the works Formula One team was MRD.|$|E
5|$|In early 1944, {{the unit}} was reorganised {{as the war}} moved north and {{planning}} began for it to deploy further afield. Major Lennard Cumpston took over command from Guiney in March. Meanwhile, in March and April a number of stations closed or transferred to ANGAU following {{a reduction in the}} threat of large-scale air raids against Australian controlled territory. As debate about the future employment of Australian forces in the Pacific continued, the future of the unit was in doubt and there was consideration given to it being disbanded. However, following a request from the Americans a detachment of 43 signalers, cipher operators, and medical orderlies was subsequently attached to US forces during operations as part of the advance to Hollandia and Tadji, with the NGAWW being the only Australian unit <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> action.|$|E
5|$|In the 6th and 7th centuries, {{the first}} devotional hymns {{were created in}} the Tamil language.

Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised, drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well. Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation. By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Java. Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.|$|E
