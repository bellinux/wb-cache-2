25|$|The overall 3D {{structure}} of the polypeptide chain {{is referred to as}} the protein's tertiary structure. Domains are the <b>fundamental</b> <b>units</b> of tertiary structure, each domain containing an individual hydrophobic core built from secondary structural units connected by loop regions. The packing of the polypeptide is usually much tighter in the interior than the exterior of the domain producing a solid-like core and a fluid-like surface. Core residues are often conserved in a protein family, whereas the residues in loops are less conserved, unless they are involved in the protein's function. Protein tertiary structure can be divided into four main classes based on the secondary structural content of the domain.|$|E

30|$|A <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> can {{be either}} a {{physical}} object or a concept that sustains its identity and participates in the interactions within a system for a sufficiently long time and in sufficiently important ways to merit quantification. Explicit definition of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> is required when studying connectivity. In cases where the <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> is defined based on a concept, a way of operationalising that concept is required. A key challenge is defining the appropriate <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> for a specific application, and often depends on the [natural] scales at which it is conceptually robust {{to work for a}} specific application. Hierarchical organization is a common feature of complex systems, and typically this refers to a nested, module-within-module structure. Each hierarchical level may, in principle, enable us to make meaningful choices about the <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> for a given application. Each level of such a hierarchical structure could be used to define the <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit.</b> For example, in neuroscience the <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> could be an individual neuron, or a cortical area. However, within some disciplines the scalar boundaries are often fuzzy and identification of clear hierarchical structures is difficult.|$|R

Both the natural logarithm and the logarithm to base two are used in information theory, corresponding to the use of nats or bits as the <b>fundamental</b> <b>units</b> of information, respectively. Binary logarithms are also used in computer science, where the binary system is ubiquitous, in music theory, where a pitch ratio of two (the octave) is ubiquitous and the cent is the binary logarithm (scaled by 1200) of the ratio between two adjacent equally-tempered pitches, and in photography to measure exposure values.|$|E
500|$|In October 2010, the CIPM {{voted to}} submit a {{resolution}} for consideration at the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM), to [...] "take note of an intention" [...] that the kilogram be {{defined in terms of}} the Planck constant, h (which has dimensions of energy times time) together with other <b>fundamental</b> <b>units.</b> This resolution was accepted by the 24th conference of the CGPM in October 2011 and further discussed at the 25th conference in 2014. Although the Committee recognised that significant progress had been made, they concluded that the data did not appear sufficiently robust to adopt the revised definition, and that work should continue to enable the adoption at the 26th meeting, scheduled for 2018. Such a definition would theoretically permit any apparatus that was capable of delineating the kilogram in terms of the Planck constant to be used as long as it possessed sufficient precision, accuracy and stability. The Kibble balance (discussed below) may be able to do this.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to several}} critics, the English {{society of the}} time was giving an {{increasing}} importance to the concepts of family and household as <b>fundamental</b> <b>units</b> for reproduction, subsistence and interaction between generations: in this context, male and female roles evolved into more static forms. Men were associated with an active, assertive role both in sexual behaviour and in managing the household, while women were {{defined in terms of}} their maternal functions, contrarily to a tradition common {{at the start of the}} century, attributing them features related to lustfulness and aggressiveness in sexual matters.

2500|$|Several scientists, such as William Prout and Norman Lockyer, had {{suggested}} that atoms were built up from a more fundamental unit, but they envisioned this unit to be {{the size of the}} smallest atom, hydrogen. Thomson in 1897 was the first to suggest that one of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>units</b> was more than 1,000 times smaller than an atom, suggesting the subatomic particle now known as the electron. Thomson discovered this through his explorations on the properties of cathode rays. Thomson made his suggestion on 30 April 1897 following his discovery that cathode rays (at the time known as Lenard rays) could travel much further through air than expected for an atom-sized particle. He estimated the mass of cathode rays by measuring the heat generated when the rays hit a thermal junction and comparing this with the magnetic deflection of the rays. His experiments suggested not only that cathode rays were over 1,000 times lighter than the hydrogen atom, but also that their mass was the same in whichever type of atom they came from. He concluded that the rays were composed of very light, negatively charged particles which were a universal building block of atoms. He called the particles [...] "corpuscles", but later scientists preferred the name electron which had been suggested by George Johnstone Stoney in 1891, prior to Thomson's actual discovery.|$|E

30|$|In Ecology {{higher levels}} of {{organization}} incorporate and constrain behaviour at lower levels (O’Neill et al., 1989). Hierarchy theory provides a clear tool for dealing with spatial scale, and suggests that all scales are equally deserving of study (Cadenasso et al., 2006). It is therefore critical that the <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> be defined clearly as well as relationships that cross scales (Ascher, 2001). The <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> is typically defined as being the ecosystem – a complex of living organisms, their physical environment, and their interrelationships in a particular unit of space (Weathers et al. 2013). In this respect, an ecosystem can be a single gravel bar, a whole river section, or the entire catchment, or an ecosystem can be a plant, a vegetation patch, or a mosaic of patches, depending on the spatiotemporal context and the specific questions. Hence, the ecosystem concept offers a unique opportunity in bridging scales and systems (e.g. aquatic and terrestrial, above- and belowground systems). Notably, this definition of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> is scale-free; therefore identifying the <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> will emerge naturally out of the ecosystem(s) in question. Whilst an appropriate definition of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> is critical in Ecology, this does not present a challenge, as the ecosystem provides a clear-cut definition that is applied ubiquitously.|$|R
