50|$|Spherulites {{are most}} common in silica-rich <b>glassy</b> <b>rocks.</b> Sometimes they compose the whole mass; more usually they are {{surrounded}} by a glassy or felsitic base. When obsidians are devitrified, the spherulites are often traceable, {{though they may be}} more or less completely recrystallized or silicified. In the center of a spherulite there may be a crystal (e.g. quartz or feldspar) or sometimes a cavity. Occasionally spherulites have zones of different colors, and while most frequently spherical, they may also be polygonal or irregular in outline. In some New Zealand rhyolites the spherulites send branching cervicorn processes (like stags horns) outwards through the surrounding glass of the rock. The name axiolites is given to long, elliptical or band-like spherulites.|$|R
50|$|Lunar breccias {{range from}} <b>glassy</b> {{vitrophyre}} melt <b>rocks,</b> to glass-rich breccia, to regolith breccias. The vitrophyres are dominantly <b>glassy</b> <b>rocks</b> that represent impact melt sheets that fill large impact structures. They contain few clasts {{of the target}} lithology, which is largely melted by the impact. Glassy breccias form from impact melt that exit the crater and entrain large volumes of crushed (but not melted) ejecta. It may contain abundant clasts that reflect the range of lithologies in the target region, sitting in a matrix of mineral fragments plus glass that welds it all together. Some of the clasts in these breccias are pieces of older breccias, documenting a repeated history of impact brecciation, cooling, and impact. Regolith breccias resemble the glassy breccias but {{have little or no}} glass (melt) to weld them together. As noted above, the basin-forming impacts responsible for these breccias pre-date almost all mare basalt volcanism, so clasts of mare basalt are very rare. When found, these clasts represent the earliest phase of mare basalt volcanism preserved.|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of stress-concentrating flaws such as microfractures, {{vesicular}} glassy materials can withstand gas pressures within vesicles in excess of 100 MPa; however, vesicles within such materials are known to decrepitate explosively at much lower internal gas pressures, both in natural systems and in the laboratory. Here we present a model that quantitatively predicts the generation of microfractures in vesicle walls during cooling. Cooling of gas-bearing vesicles in <b>glassy</b> <b>rock</b> has little effect on water solubility in the glass, but leads to a rapid decrease in gas pressure in the vesicles. The drop in pressure causes disequilibrium between {{the water in the}} glass and in the vesicle. Dehydration of the glass in a diffusive boundary layer around the vesicle leads to elastic shrinkage. The resulting strain generates large tensile tangential stresses which can exceed the strength of the glass, causing microfracturing. Such microfractures present a possible means by which <b>glassy</b> <b>rock</b> surrounding vesicles could be weakened enough to permit explosive decrepitation at low pore vapor pressures. The results have implications wherever hydrous vesicular glasses are formed. For example rocks formed in shallow subvolcanic intrusions or vent plugs may spontaneously disintegrate with explosive emission of vapor; glassy submarine lavas spontaneously decrepitate upon dredging from the ocean floor (''popping rock''); vesicular glasses produced in laboratory experiments investigating vapor-melt phase equilibria have been observed to contain abundant fractures surrounding vesicles and to dehydrate at anomalously high rates...|$|E

40|$|Issue: When {{glass cullet}} is indiscriminately {{combined}} with Portland Cement, chemical reactions can occur which {{may reduce the}} strength of the concrete. These include sugar contamination and an alkalisilica reaction. To minimize the adverse effects of these reactions, ingredients and methods used in standard PCC production should be modified. Best Practice:An adverse result of using glass cullet in Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) is the alkali-silica reaction (ASR). PCC producers have known ASR for many years because it can also occur when using vitreous (<b>glassy)</b> <b>rock</b> or slag with high amorphous silica content. The silica from the cullet or aggregate can combine with the alkalis in Portland Cement to form a siliceous gel. This gel will then absorb water and expand, causing structural weaknesses in the concrete. In addition, when mixed in PCC, sugar can cause an unpredictable increase in setting time and a decrease in the ultimate strength. A number of methods have been proposed to minimize sugar residue contamination and ASR, or to reduce their adverse affects. Modifications to the standard production of PCC include the following: Cleaning of glass aggregate Use of low alkali cement Use of low alkali pozzolan or set retarde...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{occurrences of}} <b>glassy</b> <b>rocks</b> {{containing}} long and curved phenocrysts in the Paraná volcanic province, South America, are here interpreted as paralavas. The {{large number of}} thin (0. 1 - 0. 5 m) dikes and sills of <b>glassy</b> volcanic <b>rocks</b> with hopper, hollow or curved, large crystals of clinopyroxene (up to 10 cm), plagioclase (up to 1 cm), magnetite and apatite are contained {{in the core of}} thick (> 70 m) pahoehoe flows. They are strongly concentrated in the state of Paraná, coincident with the presence of the large number of dikes in the Ponta Grossa arch. These rocks were previously defined as pegmatites, although other names have also been used. A paralava is here interpreted as the product of melting of basaltic rocks following varied, successive processes of sill emplacement in high-kerogen bituminous shale and ascent of the resultant methane. As the gas reached the lower portion of the most recent lava flow of the volcanic pile, the methane reacted with the silicate and oxide minerals of the host volcanic rock (1, 000 ºC) and thus elevated the local temperature to 1, 600 ºC. The affected area of host rock remelted (possibly 75 wt. %) and injected buoyantly the central and upper portion of the core. This methane-related mechanism explains the evidence found in the paralavas from this volcanic province, {{one of the largest in}} the continents...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{crushing}} on {{the release of}} volatile components from heated obsidian COLLECTION and analysis of gases from active volcanoes has often been used to provide data {{on the nature of}} the magmatic volatile phase (Shepherd, I 925; Jaggar, i 94 o; Huntingdon, 1973). Comparison of gas and magma can be obtained only by collections at active volcanoes, which imposes an enormous restriction on the range of available data. Ancient volcanic rocks represent a far wider spectrum of conditions, but to obtain data on the volatile phase coexisting with the magmas at the time of eruption, it is necessary touse the evidence preserved inthe lavas. Many workers have attempted to do this by heating lavas in a vacuum and analysing, by various methods, the resulting ases (Chamberlain, 19 o 8; Shepherd, I 938; Muenow, I 973; Killingley and Muenow, 1975).

40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the pressures of}} decrepitation of vesicles in synthetic glasses of feldspar compositions (NaAlSi 308 -KAlSi 308). Vesicles filled with Xe do not decrepitate at internal pressures of 160 MPa, indicating that the unflawed surface of the vesicle wall has an intrinsic strength > 80 MPa. Vesicles containing C 02 escaped decrepitation and displayed ductile deformation when the Tg was reached at the maximum P of 200 MPa (indicating an intrinsic strength higher than 100 MPa). Vesicles containing H 20 showed dramatically reduced strength, decrepitating at internal pressures {{on the order of}} 1 - 5 MPa. The H 20 -filled vesicles leaked slowly over periods of several weeks or months. The relative stability of the inclusions is strongly dependent on the quench rate, with rapidly quenched inclusions showing greater stability over long periods of time. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of radial microfractures in the walls of H 20 -filled vesicles. We account for the microfracturing with reference to recent studies of chemical-gradient stress. Our observations may account for a variety of phenomena, which occur wherever hydrous vesicular glasses are formed, including explosive decompression of vesicular <b>glassy</b> <b>rock</b> in near-surface volcanic environments, spontaneous decrepitation of vesicular basaltic glass dredged from the seafloor ("popping rocks"), and rapid loss of H 20 from synthetic vesicular glasses produced in laboratory experiments investigating fluid-melt phase equilibria...|$|E

Pangerango there are roughly between 2300 and 2700 m several sizeable pale green patches visible in the dark green montane forest. They were never visited and it intrigued me to know their vegetation which clearly must differ from the surrounding forest. End May 1950 a rintis was made from Kandangbadak {{at the base of}} the Pangerango proper westwards to a large northern spur of Mt. Pangerango, the so-called Geger Prut, over which one can descend to Cibeureum from where the trail to Cibodas can be resumed. The rintis was prepared by Mr. Verheul and Mr. Nurta, curators of the Cibodas Garden. This appeared to be quite an effort, as the rintis went up and down crossing many small ravines. Incidentally we found between the second and third ravine in a lighter place Berberis wallichiana and Anaphalis maxima, both then new for Mt. Gedeh, the latter a very rare species. At times we had to tunnel our way through very large stands of Gleichenia (paku andam), consisting of G. linearis, G. longissima and G. volubilis. These stands are characteristic for earthslides. After three hours having crossed eleven small ravines we reached a singular open sloping rocky plateau, which we called Tegal padas, from where we had a clear view on Cibodas and Rarahan; the altitude was ca. 2600 m. The dimensions of the tegal were estimated at 200 — 300 by 100 — 200 m. Soil was almost absent, the stony surface consisted of cemented irregular gravel. A tiny stream cut through it, of which the bottom was a solid dark <b>glassy</b> <b>rock.</b> The preliminary conclusion was that the structure was a lava stream overlain by lahar material. For about 50 % the palish rocky surface was visible with a large number of ground lichens identified by Mr. Groenhart as belonging to Stereocaulon, one Baeomyces and two Lecidiaceae. The vegetation was sparse: there were no Gleichenias and no grasses. All woody plants were dwarfed: Rhododendron retusum, Gaultheria fragrantissima, G. nummularioides, Symplocos sp., Eurya sp., Vaccinium varingifolium.

Examples now exposed on Macquarie Island, Southern Ocean, were largely sourced from {{proximal}} pillow lavas. In each of seven samples examined, hyaloclasts (basaltic glass grains) have a narrow major- and trace-element geochemical range, consistent with derivation of each sample {{from a single}} volcanic eruption event. Moreover, every sample analysed within the one stratigraphic section (at three sites) displays distinctive major- and trace-element geochemistry compared {{with the other two}} sections. This suggests that hyaloclasts at each site represent discrete magma batches. A single source for these <b>glassy</b> fragmental <b>rocks</b> contrasts with the dominant fault-scarp-derived polymict sedimentary rocks on Macquarie Island. We suggest that the hyaloclasts analysed in this study were deposited in small basins between the slopes of growing pillow cones along the mid-ocean ridge.

All samples presented here lie within the range of the enriched- to normal-MORB suites previously reported for the island that include the least fractionated MORB melts known globally. The interpretation of geochemically distinct magma batches over the small area of the island suggests very limited magma mixing consistent with an immature or waning magmatic system.

5000|$|The {{formation}} of halloysite {{is due to}} hydrothermal alteration, and it is often found near carbonate rocks. For example, halloysite samples found in Wagon Wheel Gap, Colorado, United States are suspected to be the weathering product of rhyolite by downward moving waters. [...] In general the {{formation of}} clay minerals is highly favoured in tropical and sub-tropical climates due to the immense amounts of water flow. Halloysite has also been found overlaying basaltic rock, showing no gradual changes from rock to mineral formation. [...] Halloysite occurs primarily in recently exposed volcanic-derived soils, but it also forms from primary minerals in tropical soils or pre-glacially weathered materials. Igneous <b>rocks,</b> especially <b>glassy</b> basaltic <b>rocks</b> {{are more susceptible to}} weathering and alteration forming halloysite.|$|R
5000|$|Sanukitoids are {{a variety}} of high-Mg granitoid found in {{convergent}} margin settings. The term [...] "sanukitoid" [...] was originally used to define a variety of Archean plutonic rock, but now also includes younger rocks with similar geochemical characteristics (Shirey & Hanson 1984; Rogers et al. 1985; Stern et al. 1989; Kelemen et al. 2004). They are called [...] "sanukitoid" [...] because of their similarity in bulk chemical composition to high-magnesium andesite from the Setouchi Peninsula of Japan, known as [...] "sanukites" [...] or [...] "setouchites" [...] (Tatsumi and Ishizaki 1982). Sanukite rocks are an andesite characterized by orthopyroxene as the mafic mineral, andesine as the plagioclase, and a <b>glassy</b> groundmass. <b>Rocks</b> formed by processes similar to those of sanukite may have compositions outside the sanukitoid field.|$|R
