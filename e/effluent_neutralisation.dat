40|$|In a Gas-to-liquid (GTL) plant, {{significant}} {{quantities of}} CO 2 and reaction water are produced and various chemicals {{are used as}} intermediate treatment chemicals. The reaction water is contaminated by these chemicals which impair the pH and the related properties of the water. The pH has to be controlled in the effluent treatment unit before the water is re-used or released to the environment. The overall aim of this investigation {{is to create a}} novel technique {{to address the problem of}} waste water treatment in GTL plants which will assist in the reduction of greenhouse gas (CO 2) emissions into the atmosphere. A laboratory-scale <b>effluent</b> <b>neutralisation</b> unit for pH control utilising gas injectors was designed and built. The unit used the CO 2 produced as a by-product of GTL process as wastewater treatment chemical instead of the conventional Sulphuric acid. The quality of wastewater after treatment with CO 2 met the standards set by the state regulatory agency. The economics of the new process shows a better payout period of 3. 6 years for capital investment of $ 1, 645 Million compared to 4. 7 years for an existing plant layout with capital investment of $ 1, 900 Million. The effects of increase in plant capacity showed a lower payback back of 2. 8 years for plant capacity of 140, 000 barrels/day (22258 m 3 /day), 3. 6 years for 34, 000 barrels/day and 6. 0 years for 12, 500 barrels/day (1987 m 3 /day) plant capacity. The sensitivity analysis using crystal ball simulator with ‘Microsoft Excel’ shows that the annual revenue has the greatest effects on the NPV of the plant than the CAPEX and inflation rate. Apart from the environmental benefits the process generates by reducing CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere, the study also concludes that the replacement of conventional Sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) unit with CO 2 improves the economics of the plant...|$|E

50|$|Environmental {{protection}} {{has long}} been a tradition at Création Baumann. As early as 1973 the enterprise was spearheading the Swiss textile industry with an expansion of its dye workshop that included a neutralisation plant. To this day, Création Baumann can achieve the prescribed norms for the processing of industrial <b>effluents</b> with the <b>neutralisation</b> plant without having to resort to any further chemical processes.|$|R
40|$|Acid {{drainage}} from {{mining activities}} is of major environmental concern in South Africa. These <b>effluents</b> require <b>neutralisation</b> and metal removal prior to release to public watercourses. A novel process is proposed whereby magnesium hydroxide {{is being used}} for neutralization of free acid and subsequent raising of the mine wastewater pH to above 7 to facilitate rapid iron (II) oxidation and precipitation as ferric hydroxide. This is followed by lime treatment for removal of magnesium as Mg(OH) 2. By using magnesium hydroxide instead of Ca(OH) 2 or CaCO 3, gypsum precipitation is avoided and metal hydroxides can be precipitated separately from gypsum. Magnesium hydroxide can be recovered from the magnesium hydroxide /gypsum mixture through dissolution of magnesium hydroxide as magnesium bicarbonate, with carbon dioxide. This study showed that magnesium hydroxide {{can be used for}} treatment of acid mine drainage rich in iron (II) -and magnesium hydroxide recovered from the sludge. Pilot-plant studies are in the planning stage to demonstrate the suitability of the magnesium process for full-scale application in the treatment of acid mine drainage. 1...|$|R
