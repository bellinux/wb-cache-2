5|$|Boxleiter {{spoke at}} the 2012 Game Developers Conference Indie Soapbox on how indie stars were made from hard work and not from the Independent Games Festival. He added that winning an award at the festival for Solipskier was an <b>insignificant</b> aspect of his career.|$|E
5|$|Involuntary {{manslaughter}} {{involves the}} causing {{of the death}} of another person without intent to kill or intention to commit grievous bodily harm. Some cases are in form similar to murder cases; whilst, in others, had death not been caused, the defendant would only be liable for an <b>insignificant</b> crime.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Cabo Verde {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for the island chain as Julia approached. Gusts of 24–30mph (38–48km/h) damaged maize crops, and waves of 9.8–14.8ft (3.0–4.5m) affected the coastline. Landslides isolated the community of Covão Grande. Rainfall was <b>insignificant,</b> peaking at 0.39in (9.91mm) in Sal.|$|E
5|$|The north-west ridge {{continues}} from Lower Man over Browncove Crags, becoming almost <b>insignificant</b> {{when it reaches}} the shore of Thirlmere, yet still separating the valley of Helvellyn Gill from the reservoir, before finally rising again to the wooded height of Great How at its terminus.|$|E
5|$|A hadron is a {{composite}} particle made of quarks held together by the strong force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons and neutrons) made of three quarks, and mesons (such as pions) made of one quark and one antiquark. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus <b>insignificant</b> constituents of the modern Universe.|$|E
5|$|According to British filmmaker Tony Rayns the film's {{presentation}} of the vanity of a man, neglecting his family, is a critique of historic men in feudal Japanese culture. In his relationship with Wakasa, Genjurō is <b>insignificant</b> and is seduced by something greater, that he can never comprehend. However, by neglecting his family, Genjurō failed to appreciate he has already been blessed with a good life, and in the process, loses it.|$|E
5|$|Albert Speer {{said that}} though Himmler seemed pedantic and <b>insignificant</b> on the surface, {{he was a}} good {{decision}} maker, had a talent for selecting highly competent staff, and successfully inserted the SS into every aspect of daily life. Historian Peter Longerich observes that Himmler's ability to consolidate his ever-increasing powers and responsibilities into a coherent system {{under the auspices of the}} SS led him to become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|Argentina, {{which had}} been <b>insignificant</b> {{during the first half}} of the 19th century, showed growth from the 1860s up until 1930 that was so {{impressive}} that it was expected to eventually become the United States of South America. This impressive and sustained economic performance was driven by the export of agricultural goods.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the fortifications {{had fallen}} into {{disrepair}} because the Swedish command did not {{pay much attention to}} these territories, and funds that were allotted for renovation were <b>insignificant.</b> In addition, the forts at Nöteborg and Nyenskans were considered sufficient to provide defense for the region. In 1702, however, some repairs were completed under the supervision of Captain L. Stobecks.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster {{is prone}} to genetic {{abnormalities}} in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. They can develop tumours of the mammary glands, lungs, uterus, and ovaries. Tumours can also develop if the animal is exposed to chemical carcinogens. Due to having slow locomotion and an <b>insignificant</b> response to bright lights and humans, as well as having a low population density, field studies allow scientists to study entire populations in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} Bactrian camel, the {{dromedary}} has a lighter build, longer limbs, shorter hairs, a harder palate and an <b>insignificant</b> or absent ethmoidal fissure. Unlike the camelids {{of the genus}} Lama, the dromedary has a hump, and in comparison has a longer tail, smaller ears, squarer feet and a greater height at the shoulder. The dromedary has four teats instead of the two in the Lama species.|$|E
5|$|Considered by itself, Artemisium was a {{relatively}} <b>insignificant</b> battle. The Allies did not defeat the Persian navy, nor prevent it from advancing further {{along the coast of}} Greece. Conversely, neither did the Persians destroy the Greek fleet, nor irreparably weaken it. The battle was thus an indecisive one, which pleased neither side.|$|E
5|$|Fishing, {{being the}} {{traditional}} industry of the region, was always considered important, {{even though the}} volumes of production remained <b>insignificant</b> {{until the beginning of}} the 20th century. In the 1920s–1930s, the Murmansk Trawl Fleet was created and the fishing infrastructure started to develop intensively. By 1940, fishing accounted for 40% of the oblast's and for 80% of Murmansk's economy.|$|E
5|$|Forster's {{attitude}} {{brought him}} into conflict {{with the people of}} the different nations he encountered and made him welcome nowhere, as he was too revolutionary and antinational for Germans, proud and opposing in his dealings with Englishmen, too unconcerned about Polish science for Poles, and too <b>insignificant</b> politically and ignored while in France.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Janet {{skirted the}} ABC islands with strong winds {{as it passed}} to the north from September24–25. In Aruba, gusts peaked at 50mph (80km/h), {{uprooting}} trees. However, damage outside of trees was primarily <b>insignificant.</b> In Bonaire, piers were destroyed, and the island's coastal boulevard was damaged. Beach facilities at Curaçao's Piscadera and Vaersen Bays suffered considerable damage. Quays along the harbor entrance were also damaged.|$|E
5|$|In {{the orders}} that {{branched}} off before the lilioid monocots, the Acorales and Alismatales, flowers differ in several ways. In some cases, like Acorus (Acorales), {{they have become}} <b>insignificant.</b> In others, like Butomus (Alismatales), they have six coloured tepals, and so could be called 'petaloid', but stamens and carpels are more numerous than in the lilioid monocots.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} exactly why Thomas {{decided to build}} Dunstanburgh. Although it was located on a strong defensive site, it was {{some distance from the}} local settlements and other strategic sites of value. Thomas held some lands in Northumberland, but they were <b>insignificant</b> in comparison to his other estates in the Midlands and Yorkshire, and until 1313 he had paid them little attention.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} {{fundamental}} interactions, gravitation is dominant at cosmological length scales, including galaxies and larger-scale structures. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, {{the effects of}} positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively <b>insignificant</b> on cosmological length scales. The remaining two interactions, the weak and strong nuclear forces, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In order to inherit it, {{both of the}} parents of an individual must carry an affected gene. Most have no family history of the condition. People with only one abnormal gene are called carriers (heterozygotes) and may have mild, but medically <b>insignificant,</b> abnormalities of copper metabolism.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of Chelsea and transitions undergone {{by the two}} clubs during the mid-2000s meant the rivalry became <b>insignificant.</b> Manchester United continued to compete for honours under Ferguson, winning 14 over the next 9 years, while Wenger at Arsenal endured a nine-year trophy drought. This was parralled with Wenger making the decision to displace experienced first-teamers in favour of youth and encourage a more fluid, less direct style of football.|$|E
5|$|The killer murders another woman, {{disposing}} {{of the body}} in a post office's dead letter office. Investigating, Black finds a human hair with a message etched into it—"hair today, gone tomorrow"—which he takes as an indication that the murderer is lashing out at a world that he feels has treated him as <b>insignificant.</b> Horn's mental condition seems to deteriorate, and he begins to take the case personally, leading Black to doubt his ability.|$|E
5|$|To {{the left}} of the open space north of the medieval city are the steep {{southern}} slopes of the Brunkebergsåsen esker, a geological feature whose remains still stretch north through the city. Missing in the painting is the small island of Strömsborg, which was little more than an <b>insignificant</b> cliff at the time.|$|E
5|$|According to the English {{officers}} of arms John Martin Robinson and Thomas Woodcock, crests {{have played a}} relatively <b>insignificant</b> role in Scottish heraldry when compared to English heraldry. In consequence many Scottish armigers, including clan chiefs, have comparatively similar crests to one another. Because of this, crest badges can sometimes show an obvious association with another clan. For example, clans associated with the Chattan Confederation share very similar crest badges bearing wild cats. Clans associated with Clan MacTavish Clan Campbell of Breadalbane, Clan MacIver and Clan Campbell use a crest badges which contain similar crests and mottoes that allude {{to that of the}} chief of Clan MacTavish.|$|E
5|$|After its creation, SEATO {{quickly became}} <b>insignificant</b> militarily, {{as most of}} its member nations contributed very little to the alliance. While SEATO {{military}} forces held joint military training, they were never employed because of internal disagreements. SEATO was unable to intervene in conflicts in Laos because France and the United Kingdom rejected use of military action. As a result, the U.S. provided unilateral support for Laos after 1962. Though sought by the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the Vietnam War was denied {{because of lack of}} British and French cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Although Herrerasaurus {{shared the}} body {{shape of the}} large {{carnivorous}} dinosaurs, it lived {{during a time when}} dinosaurs were small and <b>insignificant.</b> It was the time of non-dinosaurian reptiles, not dinosaurs, and a major turning point in the Earth's ecology. The vertebrate fauna of the Ischigualasto Formation and the slightly later Los Colorados Formation consisted mainly of a variety of crurotarsal archosaurs and synapsids. In the Ischigualasto Formation, dinosaurs constituted only about 6% {{of the total number of}} fossils, but by the end of the Triassic Period, dinosaurs were becoming the dominant large land animals, and the other archosaurs and synapsids declined in variety and number.|$|E
5|$|As 1953 began, Ferrier {{was busy}} rehearsing for Orpheus, an English {{language}} version of Orfeo ed Euridice to be staged in four performances at the Royal Opera House in February. Barbirolli had instigated this project, with Ferrier's enthusiastic approval, some months previously. Her only other engagement in January was a BBC recital recording, {{in which she}} sang works by three living English composers: Howard Ferguson, William Wordsworth and Edmund Rubbra. During her regular hospital treatment she discussed with doctors the advisability of an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries), but on learning that the impact on her cancer would probably be <b>insignificant</b> and that her voice might be badly affected, she chose {{not to have the}} operation.|$|E
5|$|Following his graduation, {{he worked}} for the BBC's {{classical}} music department, then joined EMI in 1950 as an assistant to Oscar Preuss, the head of EMI's Parlophone Records from 1950 to 1955. Although having been regarded by EMI as a vital German imprint in the past, it was then not taken seriously and only used for EMI's <b>insignificant</b> acts. After taking over Parlophone, as head of artists and repertoire, when Preuss retired in 1955, Martin recorded classical and Baroque music, original cast recordings, and regional music from around Britain and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|From its {{founding}} in the 9th century until the Industrial Revolution, Oldham {{is believed to have}} been little more than a scattering of small and <b>insignificant</b> settlements spread across the moorland and dirt tracks that linked Manchester to York. Although not mentioned in the Domesday Book, Oldham does appear in legal documents from the Middle Ages, invariably recorded as territory under the control of minor ruling families and barons. In the 13th century, Oldham was documented as a manor held from the Crown by a family surnamed Oldham, whose seat was at Werneth Hall.|$|E
5|$|From {{its origins}} to {{approximately}} {{the area of}} Sanford, the St. Johns flows north. It takes a sharp turn west near Sanford for a few miles—which {{is referred to as}} the St. Johns River offset, but shortly changes direction to flow north again. Geologists hypothesize that the west-flowing offset may have formed earlier than the north flowing portions, possibly during the late Tertiary or early Pleistocene era 66 to 12 million years ago. Some fracturing and faulting may also be responsible for the offset. Although seismic activity in Florida is mostly <b>insignificant,</b> several minor earthquakes have occurred near the St. Johns River, caused by the trough created by Pangaean rifting.|$|E
5|$|Green-head ant {{workers are}} gamergates, meaning they can {{reproduce}} with winged males. With workers {{taking over the}} reproductive role, queens are relatively <b>insignificant</b> and are rarely produced in colonies. Nuptial flight begins in spring, with males mating {{with one or two}} females. Queens that establish their own colonies are semi-claustral, going out and forage to support their young. Another way colonies are formed is through budding, where a subset of the colony leaves the main colony for an alternative nest site. The green-head ant is known for its painful and venomous sting that can cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive humans. However, they can also be beneficial to humans, acting as a form of pest control by preying on agricultural pests such as beetles, moths and termites.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Macartney and {{his family}} moved from Maitland to Sydney. In his school cricketing career Macartney {{distinguished}} himself as an all-rounder at Woollahra Superior and Chatswood public schools, before briefly attending Fort Street High School. Macartney asserted that school cricket was <b>insignificant</b> in his development, believing that he learned more about cricket during informal summer cricket games with his brother at the local park, with their dog acting as a fielder. It was during his school career that Macartney was noticed by incumbent Australian captain Monty Noble, who heaped praise on him in a newspaper article.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{storage in}} the Pushkar Lake {{has been reduced}} alarmingly, leaving only a small puddle of water in many years during the festival season when pilgrims flock to the lake for sacred bathing during the Hindu holy month of Kartik, when the Pushkar Fair is held. During the 2009 Pushkar fair, the {{situation}} became very grim when the lake dried up entirely. Alternate arrangements were made to facilitate sacred bathing by providing water in concrete tanks {{near one of the}} upper ghats, fed by tube wells from ground water sources. While the authorities have been blamed for poor planning by de-silting the lake, the drought situation has resulted in <b>insignificant</b> rainfall in the area to fill the lake.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} goods {{produced}} indigenously, {{it was estimated}} that due to the inability of traditional suppliers to deliver manufactured goods because of trade embargoes and shipping shortages up to 400 new articles were produced in Australian factories {{as a result of the}} war. This was not an <b>insignificant</b> number, although the transformation of the Australian economy as a result of World War I was by no means as significant as that which occurred during World War II. The expansion of the steel industry that occurred during this time laid the foundation for future industrialisation.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s, Brazil {{exported}} 11,000tons of cacao and by 1880 {{this had}} increased to 73,500tons. Between 1821 and 1825, 41,174tons of sugar were exported, rising to 238,074tons between 1881 and 1885. Until 1850, rubber production was <b>insignificant,</b> but between 1881 and 1890, it had reached third place among Brazilian exports. This was about 81tons between 1827 and 1830 reaching 1,632tons in 1852. By 1900 {{the country was}} exporting 24,301,452tons of rubber. Brazil also exported around 3,377,000tons of coffee between 1821 and 1860 while between 1861 and 1889 this reached 6,804,000tons. Technological innovations {{also contributed to the}} growth of exports, in particular the adoption of steam navigation and railroads allowed for faster and more convenient cargo transportation.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{the season}} {{resulted}} in about 63 fatalities and over $10 million in damages. The {{first and last}} storms of the season were largely <b>insignificant,</b> although the second, fourth, and fifth storms had considerable effects. Two hurricanes struck the United States: a major hurricane that struck Texas and Louisiana in late September, disrupting the Louisiana Maneuvers, and Hurricane Five, which made two landfalls in Florida, {{the first of which}} was near Miami at Category 2 intensity, inflicting widespread damage. Another major storm—Hurricane Four—traversed the Caribbean before striking the Nicaragua–Honduras border at Category 4 intensity, leaving 47 men dead at sea.|$|E
5|$|Instead of anticoagulation, a {{follow-up}} imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis {{is an option}} for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a high risk for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation. This technique can benefit those at a high risk for bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns {{about the risk of}} bleeding are <b>insignificant.</b> When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective.|$|E
