40|$|Introduction. Immunosuppressant and {{steroid therapy}} in {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus (SLE) {{increases the risk of}} human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, one of which is <b>giant</b> <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminata</b> (GCA). To our knowledge, there is no report evaluating the correlation between immunosuppressive and steroid therapy in patients with SLE and the prevalence of GCA. Case Report. A 42 -year-old female was diagnosed with SLE a year ago and has been treated with steroids and immunosuppressive drugs. In the last few months she presented GCA involving the genital area recurring almost every two months. Type 6 and 11 HPVs were identified in vulva, vagina, and cervix. Methods. PubMed, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library literature were searched from inception to July 2015. Authors screened all titles and abstracts and read full text article, and two case-control studies were found relevant. Results. SLE patients in both studies were under immunosuppressive and steroid therapy. Condyloma acuminata was diagnosed at 108 months (latest) and 1 month (earliest) after SLE. Type 6, 11, 16, 42, and oncogenic group of HPV were identified. Conclusions. GCA is a type of HPV infection seldom observed in SLE patients. Therefore, their correlation is still unclear. Period of time since SLE was diagnosed and GCA varies from months to years. A more thorough physical and laboratory examination leading to HPV and other infectious disease is recommended...|$|E

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONBuschke–Löwenstein tumour, {{also known}} as <b>Giant</b> <b>condyloma</b> acuminatum, is a rare, sexually {{transmitted}} disease that affects ano-genital region. BLT is a slow growing cauliflower-like tumour, locally aggressive and destructive. Human papillomavirus {{has been identified as}} an important contributory factor in the development of tumour. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 45 year uncircumcised male presented with complaints of cauliflower like growth on glans penis. Growth started as a small papule on the corona sulcus at 12 O’clock position 6 months back. Patient developed pain and dysuria due to compression of urethral meatus. Patient has history of multiple sexual partners. DISCUSSIONBLT, first described by Buschke and Lowenstein in 1925. They observed a penile lesion that clinically resembled both common <b>condyloma</b> <b>acuminata</b> and squamous cell carcinoma, but differing from both of them regarding the biological behaviour and the histopathological appearance. GCA can be differentiated from ordinary condylomas by the characteristic “pushing” rather than “infiltrating” effect that tends to compress and displace the underlying tissue. CONCLUSIONWe have successfully treated a penile BLT with surgical excision and no relapse up to 6 months. Surgical excision could be considered an effective therapy in the treatment...|$|R
