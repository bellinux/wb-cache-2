5|$|One {{person could}} say that 'Hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can write to me a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> {{for the last ten}} years until I heard that song, and I realized, after all, I can be my own hero,' and that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, you know? It meant something to someone.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E

He worked with producer Sebastian Krys, who helped him [...] "enrich what was there but [...] the essence" [...] of the songs.|$|E

2500|$|Ryan Benjamin Tedder {{was born}} on June 26, 1979 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was raised by an {{extended}} family of missionaries and pastors in a Christian church. He began learning {{to play the piano}} at the age of three via the Suzuki method. His early interest in music was prompted by his musician father and school-teacher mother, who coaxed their young son into practicing piano in exchange for candy corn. Tedder started singing at the age of seven. A self-taught vocalist, Tedder began honing this skill at the age of twelve by imitating his favorite artists, who ranged from The Beatles to other acts like Peter Gabriel, Stevie Wonder and Sting. He has commented, [...] "I sang for two hours a day <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> until I was eighteen."
