That’s a hard {{question}} {{because when you}} see the scenes of Emma and Will, you obviously think 'Oh of course they’re supposed to be together, of course, of course!' but the fact <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he’s a married man and Emma knows that’s wrong, and she doesn’t want to be a homewrecker. She doesn’t want to ruin a relationship. So I guess in a perfect world, she could find someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can become a little bit more like Will. But maybe it’s all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love." [...] She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): [...] "We were friends. We knew each other before we started this job. We worked together once before. So, that’s always helpful when you know the person that you’re working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he’s a really good friend, so that makes that stuff a little bit easier." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 14 February 2007 {{news conference}} U.S. President George W. Bush reiterated {{his claim that}} the Quds Force was causing unrest in Iraq, stating: [...] "I can say with {{certainty}} that the Quds force, {{a part of the}} Iranian government, has provided these sophisticated IEDs that have harmed our troops. And I'd like to repeat, I do not know whether or not the Quds Force was ordered from the top echelons of government. But my point is what's worse – them ordering it and it happening, or them not ordering it and it happening? And so we will continue to protect our troops. ... to say it [...] is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the Commander-in-Chief's decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way. And I will continue to do so. ... Whether Ahmadinejad ordered the Quds force to do this, I don't think we know. But we do know that they're there, and I intend to do something about it. And I've asked our commanders to do something about it. And we're going to protect our troops. ... I don't think we know who {{picked up the phone and}} said to the Quds Force, go do this, but we know it's a vital part of the Iranian government. …What matters <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we're responding. The idea that somehow we're manufacturing the idea that the Iranians are providing IEDs is preposterous. ... My job is to protect our troops. And when we find devices that are in that country that are hurting our troops, we're going to do something about it, pure and simple. ... does this mean you're trying to have a pretext for war? No. It means I'm trying to protect our troops." ...|$|E

60|$|They {{who first}} {{ran into the}} notion of ACCIDENTS, {{as a sort of}} real beings that needed {{something}} to inhere in, were forced to find out the word SUBSTANCE to support them. Had the poor Indian philosopher (who imagined that the earth also wanted something to bear it up) but thought of this word substance, he needed not to have been at the trouble to find an elephant to support it, and a tortoise to support his elephant: the word substance would have done it effectually. And he that inquired might have taken it for as good an answer from an Indian philosopher,--that substance, without knowing what it <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> which supports the earth, as take it for a sufficient answer and good doctrine from our European philosophers,--that substance, without knowing what it <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> which supports accidents. So that of substance, we have no idea of what it is, but only a confused obscure one of what it does.|$|E
6000|$|Thus, my friends, {{all that}} all men have longed for we possess; we want no more, and we shall have no more. If, under {{the present state of}} things, we cannot be holy, we shall never be holy. If we cannot use our right in this kingdom of Christ, how can we become {{citizens}} of God's everlasting kingdom, when Christ shall have delivered up the dominion to His Father, and God shall be all in all? God has done all for us that God will do. He has given us His Son for a Saviour, and a Church in which and by which to worship that Saviour; and what more would we have? Alas! my friends, have we yet used fairly what God has given us? and if not, how terrible will be our guilt! [...] "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?" [...] And yet how many do neglect--how few live as if they were citizens of Christ's kingdom! It seems as if God had been too good to us, and heaped us so heavily with blessings, that we were tired of them, and despised them as common things. Common things? They are the very things, as I said, which the great and the wise in all ages have longed for and prayed for, and yet never found! Surely, surely, God may well say to us, [...] "What could have been done unto my vineyard which has not been done to it?" [...] What, indeed? I wish I could take some of you into a heathen country for a single week, that you might see what it is not to know of a Saviour--not to be members of His Church, as we are. Why, we here in England are in the very garden of the Lord. We have but to stretch out our hand to the tree of life, and eat and live for ever. From our cradle to our grave, Christ the King is ready to guide, to teach, to comfort, to deliver us. When we are born, we are christened in His name, made members of Christ, children of God, and inheritors by hope of the kingdom of heaven. Is that nothing? It is, alas! nothing in the eyes of most parents! As we grow older, are we not taught who we are--taught call God our Father--taught about Jesus Christ, who He is, and what He <b>is?</b> <b>Is</b> <b>that,</b> too, nothing? Alas! that knowledge is generally a mere meaningless school-lesson, cared for neither by child nor by man. At confirmation, again, we solemnly declare that we belong to Christ's kingdom, and that we will live as His subjects, and His alone. And we are brought to His bishops, to be received as free, reasonable, Christian people, to claim our citizenship in the kingdom of God. Is that nothing? Yet that, too, is nothing with three-fourths of us. Nothing? Hear me, young people--as I have often told you--you are ready enough to excuse yourselves from your confirmation vows, by saying you were not taught to understand them--were not taught how to put them into practice. That may be true, or it may not; your sin is just the same. No one with any common honesty or common sense could answer as you have to the bishop's questions at confirmation, without knowing that you did make a promise, and knowing well enough what you promised--and you who carried to confirmation a careless heart and a lying tongue, have only yourselves to blame for it!--But to proceed. Is not Christ present, or ready to be present, with us? Sunday after Sunday, for years, have not the churches been opened all around us, inviting us to enter and worship Christ, knowing that where two or three are gathered together, there is Christ in the midst of them. Is that nothing? This Creed--these Lessons--these prayers, which Sunday after Sunday you have used;--are they nothing? Are they not all proofs that the kingdom of God is come to you, and means whereby you can behave like children of the kingdom? And not on Sundays alone. Have we not been taught daily, in our own houses, in our own hearts, in all danger, and trouble, and temptation, to pray to Jesus Christ, our King, knowing that He will hear and save all them that put their trust in Him? ...|$|E
