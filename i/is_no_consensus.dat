5|$|Critics of the {{argument}} include Averroes, who objected to its methodology, Al-Ghazali, who disagreed with its characterization of God, and modern critics who state that its piecemeal derivation of God's attributes allows people to accept parts of {{the argument}} but still reject God's existence. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> among modern scholars on the classification {{of the argument}}; some {{say that it is}} ontological while others say it is cosmological.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus {{was assassinated}} along with Hairan I in late 267; the date is debated and some {{scholars}} propose 266 or 268, but Vaballathus dated {{his first year}} of reign between August 267 and August 268, making late 267 the most probable date. The assassination took place either in Anatolia, or in Syria; there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> on the manner, perpetrator or the motive behind the act.|$|E

Most professional astrologers are paid {{to predict the future}} or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> on pacifism among modern Hindu scholars. The {{conflict}} between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and {{the theories of}} just war prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, as being an allegory, wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where man's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.|$|E
5|$|In biology, borates {{have low}} {{toxicity}} in mammals (similar to table salt), but are more toxic to arthropods {{and are used}} as insecticides. Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron a necessary plant nutrient. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> on whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although {{there is some evidence}} it supports bone health.|$|E

5|$|The term hippocampal {{formation}} {{is used to}} refer to the hippocampus proper and its related parts. However, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> as to what parts are included. Sometimes the hippocampus is said to include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum. Some references include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum in the hippocampal formation, and others also include the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. The neural layout and pathways within the hippocampal formation are very similar in all mammals.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Amir's writings were published in Poedjangga Baroe, although some earlier ones were published in Timboel and Pandji Poestaka. None of his creative works are dated, and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> regarding when individual poems were written. However, there is a consensus that the works included in Nyanyi Sunyi were written after those included in Buah Rindu, despite the latter being published last. Johns writes that the poems in the collections appear to be arranged in chronological order; {{he points to the}} various degrees of maturity Amir showed as his writing developed.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> among {{philosophers}} {{about many}} of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the truth about unobservable things and whether scientific reasoning can be justified at all. In addition to these general questions about science as a whole, philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as biology or physics). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.|$|E

5|$|The curve-billed thrasher (Toxostoma curvirostre) is a {{medium-sized}} mimid {{that is a}} member of the genus Toxostoma, native to the southwestern United States and much of Mexico. Referred to as the default desert bird, it is a non-migratory species. Several subspecies have been classified since 1827, though there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> on the number. Allopatric speciation is believed to have played a major role in the variations of the curve-billed. It shares striking similarities in appearance with another Toxostoma member, Bendire's thrasher. Nevertheless, it is recognized for its grey color and sickle-shaped bill. It generally resides in desert regions of the United States and Mexico, but can inhabit areas predominately populated by humans.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> {{about how}} {{effectively}} the edict was enforced. Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, {{and a black}} market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets. The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains), widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps {{within a year of}} the edict's issue. Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic, and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> {{about how}} to {{classify}} the severity of psoriasis. Mild psoriasis {{has been defined as}} a percentage of body surface area (BSA)≤10, a Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score ≤10, and a dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score ≤10. Moderate to severe psoriasis was defined by the same group as BSA >10 or PASI score >10 and a DLQI score >10. The DLQI is a 10 question tool used to measure the impact of several dermatologic diseases on daily functioning. The DLQI score ranges from 0 (minimal impairment) to 30 (maximal impairment) and is calculated with each answer being assigned 0–3 points with higher scores indicating greater social or occupational impairment.|$|E

5|$|Tvrtko's {{coronation}} as King of Bosnia and Serbia {{was held}} in the fall of 1377 (probably 26 October, the feast day of Saint Demetrius), but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> as to where it took place. The Ragusan chronicler Mavro Orbini wrote, in 1601, that the coronation was performed in the Serbian monastery of Mileševa by its Orthodox metropolitan bishop, an opinion accepted today only in Serbian historiography. Citing more recent archaeological and historical research, Croatian and Bosnian historians agree that the coronation more likely took place in the Franciscan Church of Saint Nicholas in the Bosnian town of Mile, which is the undisputed place of the coronations of Tvrtko I's successors. Writing to Ragusa shortly after his coronation, Tvrtko successfully claimed Saint Demetrius' income, which had been paid to the kings of Serbia since the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commentary}} of the 1219 treaty with Galicia–Volhynia {{it is noted that}} Mindaugas took {{the wife of}} Vismantas from the Bulionis family for himself. It is assumed that Vismantas' wife and Morta are the same woman. It is known that Vismatas died in 1252 in a battle against Mindaugas; however the date of Mindaugas and Morta's wedding is unknown. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> on how many children Morta had. The chronicles mention two sons, Replys and Gerstukas, in 1261. In 1263 two sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, were assassinated together with Mindaugas. This is the only information available and historians disagree on whether these are the same two sons, whose name got distorted by scribes, or they are four sons. There is no data on any rivals to the crown after the assassination, except for Vaišvilkas and Tautvilas; it would indicate that, whether there were two or four sons, they had perished in their youth.|$|E
5|$|The above {{passage from}} Mahabharata emphasises the {{cardinal}} importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means: Ahimsa {{is the highest}} virtue, Ahimsa is the highest self-control, Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching. Some other examples where the phrase Ahimsa Paramo Dharma are discussed include Adi Parva, Vana Parva and Anushasana Parva. The Bhagavad Gita, among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the theories of just war. However, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, {{when he or she}} faces moral questions.|$|E

5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> on when {{or where}} Bundy began killing women. He told {{different}} stories to different people, {{and refused to}} divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution. He told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in 1969 in Ocean City, New Jersey, but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle. He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in Atlantic City in 1969 while visiting family in Philadelphia. To homicide detective Robert D. Keppel, he hinted at a murder in Seattle in 1972, and another in 1973 involving a hitchhiker near Tumwater, Washington, but refused to elaborate. Rule and Keppel both believe {{that he may have}} started killing as a teenager. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he abducted and killed 8-year-old Ann Marie Burr of Tacoma in 1961 when he was 14, an allegation he denied repeatedly. His earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974 when he was 27 years old. By then he had (by his own admission) mastered the necessary skills—in the era before DNA profiling—to leave minimal incriminating evidence at a crime scene.|$|E
