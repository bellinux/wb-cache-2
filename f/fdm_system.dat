Additionally, non-commercial materials (e. g., polycaprolactone, ceramic loaded polymers, carbon nanotube loaded polymers) have been processed using FDM in part to demonstrate the potential diversity in material selection. ^ Recently, a myriad of personal 3 D Printers using material extrusion processes have received much attention because they resemble the initial steps towards transforming AM technologies into a home consumer item. These steps were also taken during the 1980 s by inkjet printing technologies when they were first entering the home consumer market. However, before inkjet printers became a home consumer item, challenges related to the controlled flow of inks and the clogging of print heads needed to be resolved. Synonymously, FDM technologies need to resolve issues related to part accuracy, surface roughness, build time, and mechanical properties before they can be fully adopted by industry and home consumers. ^ A multi-material, multi-technology (MMMT) <b>FDM</b> <b>system</b> was developed to enable experimental methods related to the FDM attributes in need of improvement.

When it comes to directly producing the end products, the process is still in its infancy, using inferior materials and flat layer deposition, bringing forth shortcomings such as poor surface quality, low strength for curved parts, and undesirably higher number of layers. Some of these shortcomings can be overcome if material deposition is modelled in curved layers as against the traditional flat-layer slicing and deposition. While the stair case effect can be significantly minimized, mechanical properties of the parts will also be enhanced due to continuity in fibres and the elimination of the inherent weakness between laminations.
