25|$|In 2007 the {{economic}} environment remained conducive to further growth of banking activity in Morocco following {{a very good}} year for the sector in 2006. In 2007 macroeconomic growth, excluding the agricultural sector, remained quite robust, providing the background for dynamic growth in banking credits. Total assets of the banking sector increased by 21.6% to MAD 654.7 billion ($85.1 billion), which is above the previous year's high annual growth rate of 18.1%. The structure of the <b>domestic</b> <b>sector</b> has remained steady in the past two years, with the landscape dominated by three major local banks. The state has started to remove itself from the <b>domestic</b> <b>sector</b> by surrendering part of its share capital in public banks. At end-2007 public capital still held controlling stakes in five banks and four financing companies. Meanwhile, foreign ownership in the local financial sector continues to grow, with foreign institutions controlling five banks and eight financing companies as well as holding significant stakes in four banks and three financing companies.|$|E
25|$|During {{the year}} 2013-14, The plant load factor (PLF) of {{coal-fired}} thermal power stations is only 65.43% whereas these stations can run above 85% PLF comfortably provided there is adequate electricity {{demand in the}} country. The additional electricity generation at 85% PLF is nearly 240 billion units which is adequate to replace all the LPG and Kerosene consumption in <b>domestic</b> <b>sector.</b> The incremental cost of generating additional electricity is only their coal fuel cost which is less than 3 Rs/kWh. Enhancing the PLF of coal-fired stations and encouraging domestic electricity consumers to substitute electricity in place of LPG and Kerosene in household cooking, would reduce the government subsidies and idle capacity of thermal power stations can be put to use economically. The domestic consumers {{who are willing to}} surrender the subsidised LPG / Kerosene permits or eligible for subsidised LPG / Kerosene permits, may be given free electricity connection and subsidised electricity tariff.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the applicability of}} optimal taxation theory to source-based capital incomes when significant tax evasion is observed. Without tax evasion a modified Ramsey Rule may reduce distortions brought by international capital mobility, leading to levying differentiated tax rates in <b>domestic</b> <b>sectors</b> inversely proportioned to observed elasticities in terms of capital mobility. The introduction of tax evasion brings additional complexity. The viability of optimal tax rates 0 la Ramsey is explored, and additional requirement (namely that tax evasion is either very low or very homogeneous) are shown to be {{necessary in order to}} allow policy-makers to obtain the tax rates minimizing total excess burden.

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a double-{{threshold}} model and inspect the threshold effect of FDI technology spillover {{by using the}} industrial panel data of 30 Chinese provinces from 2000 to 2011.

Therefore, there are two main conclusions that can be derived. One conclusion is that the FDI technology spillover is a decreasing function of THE technology gap in both the eastern and western <b>domestic</b> industrial <b>sector</b> and is a concave curve function of the technology gap in the central <b>domestic</b> industrial <b>sector.</b> Another conclusion is that the FDI technology spillover has been increasing gradually in each <b>domestic</b> industrial <b>sector</b> in recent years.|$|R
