5|$|Sea snakes {{appear to}} be active both day and night. In the morning, and {{sometimes}} late in the afternoon, they {{can be seen at}} the surface basking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunlight,</b> and they dive when disturbed. They have been reported swimming at depths over , and can remain submerged for as long as a few hours, possibly depending on temperature and degree of activity.|$|E
5|$|This {{species may}} be active {{during the day}} and at night. However, on bright, sunny days, they are usually found coiled or {{stretched}} out somewhere in the shade. In the morning and on cool days, they can often be seen basking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunlight.</b> They often emerge at sunset to warm themselves on warm ground (i.e., sidewalks, roads) and then become very active throughout the night, when they are usually found swimming or crawling. Contrary to popular belief, they are capable of biting while under water.|$|E
5|$|Rushes, tussock sedge, cattails, jewelweed, sphagnum, {{and various}} native true grasses {{are found in}} the bog turtle's habitat, as well as some shrubs and trees such as willows, red maples, and alders. It is {{important}} for their habitat to have an open canopy, because bog turtles spend a considerable amount of time basking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunlight.</b> An open canopy allows sufficient sunlight to reach the ground so that the bog turtles can manage their metabolic processes through thermoregulation. The incubation of eggs also requires levels of sunlight and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal bog turtle habitat is early successional. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary sunlight. Erosion and runoff of nutrients into the wetlands accelerate succession. Changes caused by humans have begun to eliminate bog turtles from areas where they would normally survive.|$|E

25|$|Next, {{the coffee}} is sorted, and labeled as green coffee. Another {{way to let}} the coffee seeds dry is to let them sit on a {{concrete}} patio and rake over them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunlight.</b> Some companies use cylinders to pump in heated air to dry the coffee seeds, though this is generally in places where the humidity is very high.|$|E
25|$|The {{trouble with}} our genial humorist {{is that he}} is beyond his depth. He would not make a success if he turned statesman. He would not make much of a success if he turned missionary; as a humorist he is incomparable. Every man to his trade. Let Mark {{remember}} this, and let him choose as a target for his satire something other than the heroic men who have been through the nightmare of blood and ruin in China, while he has been comfortably basking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunlight</b> that makes eternal summer for a genius admired of both old world and new.|$|E
25|$|Holy wells {{were often}} visited at Beltane, {{and at the}} other Gaelic festivals of Imbolc and Lughnasadh. Visitors to holy wells would pray for health while walking sunwise (moving from east to west) around the well. They would then leave offerings; {{typically}} coins or clooties (see clootie well). The first water drawn from a well on Beltane was seen as being especially potent, as was Beltane morning dew. At dawn on Beltane, maidens would roll in the dew or wash their faces with it. It would also be collected in a jar, left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunlight,</b> and then filtered. The dew was thought to increase sexual attractiveness, maintain youthfulness, and help with skin ailments.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, he rebounded but he {{had still}} not won a race, though he made the Chase and {{finished}} second in both Dover races. He nearly won the fall Martinsville but a flat tire with 15 laps to go gave Denny Hamlin the win. A couple weeks later he and Jeff Gordon got into a wreck long after the caution was out. Burton walked up the track to confront Gordon and the two got into a shoving match. Burton finished 12th <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final standings. Afterwards, Burton assumed responsibility for the incident, stating he was attempting {{to catch up to}} Gordon, but was unable to see <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunlight's</b> glare.|$|R
500|$|The reform {{negotiations}} {{also attracted}} attention from lobbyists, including deals between certain lobby {{groups and the}} advocates of the law to win the support of groups that had opposed past reforms, as <b>in</b> 1993. <b>The</b> <b>Sunlight</b> Foundation documented many of the reported ties between [...] "the healthcare lobbyist complex" [...] and politicians in both parties.|$|R
25|$|An {{avenue of}} raintrees (Samanea saman) is located along {{a section of}} Foxton Avenue (Captain Cook Highway) {{to the south and}} west of the church. Six are located on {{the eastern side of the}} road with another five on the western side, and make an emotive setting for St David's Church {{particularly}} on the approach out of the centre of town to the south. The interlocking canopies that stretch over the road create a tunnel of shade beyond which stands the church <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunlight.</b> The large volume of space protected by this canopy stands above a carpet of grass on the triangular lot between Foxton Avenue and Mossman Street, and effect which also highlights the positioning of the church.|$|E
25|$|His first {{impression}} {{was that it}} was the remains of an animal, very mutilated, and in an advanced state of decomposition. The carcass was very pale pink, almost white, in colour, with a silver reflection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunlight.</b> It was composed of a rubbery substance of a very hard consistency, such that it could only be cut with great difficulty. The part of the carcass that was visible measured 18 feet (approx. 6 meters) in length and 7 feet (approx. 2Â½ meters) in width. Webb estimated its weight at nearly 5 tons, if not more. He believed it was the remains of a giant octopus, as it appeared to have the stumps of four arms, with another arm buried nearby.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that Elasmosaurus and its kin stalked schools of fish, concealing themselves below and moving the head slowly up as they approached. The eyes of the animal were located {{at the top of}} the head and allowed them to see directly upward. This stereoscopic vision would help it find small prey. Hunting from below would also have helped by silhouetting the prey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunlight</b> while concealing Elasmosaurus in the dark waters below. Elasmosaurids probably ate small bony fish and marine invertebrates, as their small, non-kinetic skulls would have limited the prey they could eat. The long, slender teeth were adapted for seizing prey and not tearing, and hence it was swallowed whole. It swallowed small stones to aid its digestion.|$|E

50|$|Coleman's {{design is}} adapted to suit Singapore's {{tropical}} climate; for instance, the wide verandahs give shade and protect the timber-louvred windows {{on the ground floor}} from heavy downpours. <b>The</b> windows, <b>in</b> turn, diffuse <b>the</b> <b>sunlight</b> and induce cross ventilation. The pews are backed with woven rattan, a lighter, cooler and more comfortable material.|$|R
500|$|The episode {{features}} the song called [...] "Livin' <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sunlight,</b> Lovin' in the Moonlight" [...] by Tiny Tim. At the point the pilot {{had already been}} completed, music editor Nick Carr was asked to retool the existing music on it. Carr said [...] "When I first started on SpongeBob, my duties were mainly music editorial but would quickly thrust me into the composers/supervisor chair." [...] The production team had no budget and no music but they placed the budget on the song called [...] "Livin' <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sunlight,</b> Lovin' in the Moonlight". Carr said [...] " [...] a sadly familiar scenario with most cartoons for television. By the time it comes to consider the music, the budget is blown." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Hillenburg who also functioned as {{storyboard}} director, Derek Drymon, who also functioned as storyboard artist, and Tim Hill.

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Jeffrey Spender visited his mother, Cassandra Spender, was shot in Los Angeles. Those members of The X-Files crew who had moved with the show from Vancouver to Los Angeles still had {{problems}} adjusting to the changes when filming an episode. They were forced to adjust to changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunlight,</b> since Vancouver had this [...] "dark and gray feel" [...] compared to California's sunny atmosphere. Kim Manners {{said that it was}} difficult {{to get used to the}} new area of filming. This episode marks the first time new stock footage was used for the J.

5|$|The team {{created new}} engines {{to satisfy their}} needs for the game. The {{artificial}} intelligence was created to coordinate with players; the addition of Ellie as artificial intelligence was {{a major contributor to}} the engine. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>sunlight</b> seeps <b>in</b> through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The gameplay introduced difficulty to the team, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. The game's user interface design also underwent various iterations throughout development.|$|R

500|$|... "Goodbyeee" [...] has no closing titles, simply fading {{from the}} protagonists {{charging}} across no man's land under fire, {{to a field}} of poppies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunlight,</b> {{a reference to the}} poem [...] "In Flanders Fields" [...] and the flower's symbolic significance. The music was also changed to a slow, echoey solo piano arrangement (recorded in a school gymnasium), finishing with three strong bass-drum notes, interposed with sound effects of gunshot, and later birdsong. In the 25th anniversary special interview, Richard Curtis stated that the production team had not intended for such an ending and the idea of the scene fading to the poppy field was only conceived after some of the cast stated their reluctance in doing a second take.|$|E
500|$|In snakes, partial {{absence of}} pigment {{is more common}} than {{absolute}} albinism. [...] For snakes that are usually patterned in colours, they appear as a faint blue, peach or yellowish. [...] In these cases, {{there has been a}} genetic mutation in the melanin and pigment delivery. [...] The appearance comes from the inability for full colours to be present, such as black, red, brown and others. The eyes of an albino snake are typically red or pink. Albino snakes can remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunlight</b> for several hours with minimal harm. [...] Corn snakes and snakes of larger types, such as a boa or diamondback snakes, are the most commonly affected by albinism often appearing to be a pinkish or yellowish colour.|$|E
500|$|The adaptations {{have had}} an {{influence}} {{on the work of}} the writer Mark Gatiss. Interviewed in 2008, Gatiss said that Lost Hearts is his favourite adaptation because it is the one that frightened him as a child and that [...] "I absolutely love The Treasure of Abbot Thomas. The moment when Michael Bryant has found the treasure and ... is obviously losing his wits. He just says, rationally, 'It is a thing of slime, I think. Darkness and slime ...' There's also the fantastic scene where he thinks he's got away with it by putting the treasure back.

500|$|Vampire Journals (1997) is a {{spin-off}} of the Subspecies film series, {{featuring the}} vampire Ash. Vampire Journals follows Zachary, a vampire with a conscience, who hunts the vampire bloodline that sired him. After witnessing {{the love of}} his life get turned into a vampire, Zachary destroys both her, and his master, and former protÃ©gÃ© of Ash, Serena. Zachary, armed with the enchanted sword of a great vampire slayer called Laertes, seeks out the rest of Serena's bloodline to eradicate them. Zachary travels to Bucharest to find Ash. Zachary uses Ash's penchant for music and women to bait him out into the open for attack. Ash sets his sights on pianist Sofia, but is thwarted by Zachary during his first attempt to take Sofia. [...] It is revealed through a conversation between Ash and a seer that Zachary's coming was expected and that the two are destined to fight; however, Ash is to be the victor. Ash does not give up on acquiring Sofia, and hires her for his nightclub. Over the next few nights he drains her of blood, so that he may turn her into a new apprentice. He also makes a deal with Zachary: he will give Zachary a consort, protection from the Sun, and allow Zachary to see Sophia if he leaves the city the following night. While Ash is preparing to sire Sofia, he gives his daytime consult Iris the key to Zachary's room, so that she may dispose of his sleeping body <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunlight.</b> Seeing that his obsession with Sofia will ruin both their lives, Iris releases Zachary instead. Zachary arrives too late; Sophia has already accepted Ash's blood. Fighting off a weakened Ash, Zachary and Sofia escape from the nightclub. Ash follows them, but the rising sun becomes a problem. Zachary manages to get back the sword and kill Ash, whose body falls into the Sun's rays. Zachary and Sofia then find refuge in a nearby closet.|$|E
