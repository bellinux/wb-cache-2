50|$|As <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> France, <b>the</b> {{official}} language is French. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> {{majority of the}} region's population speaks Réunion Creole.|$|R
5|$|Henry {{seems to}} have been known in {{northern}} Germany, but he was largely ignored <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Roman Catholic world.|$|E
5|$|The {{place of}} birth of the town's {{residents}} was 98.5% United Kingdom, 0.35% Republic of Ireland, 0.37% from other European Union countries, and 0.75% from <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E
5|$|A larger {{outbreak}} occurs <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, and {{the virus}} further evolves {{to mimic the}} nanomachines' abilities. Yuuji delays the creatures' advance as Ai creates the projected being and uses all of her power to purge the infected area of the virus. Yuuji and Ai are later discharged from CURE and spend time together, free from their duties at last.|$|E
50|$|British Rail owned ships had red funnels {{with a white}} logo. <b>Elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> Sealink <b>the</b> symbol {{was white}} on blue.|$|R
50|$|<b>Elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> Etruria, <b>the</b> god {{was called}} Śuri, {{probably}} {{to be identified}} with Soranus, a Sabine deity associated with the underworld.|$|R

5|$|Although officially located {{slightly}} {{outside the}} town's boundaries in Walsall Wood, Shire Oak School (the former Shire Oak Grammar School) takes many pupils from Brownhills.

5|$|In 1843, {{another group}} of planned Greek Revival townhouses was built at 160-168 Second Street. Unusual for urban houses, they {{featured}} one-and-a-half-story porticos on their front facades, with Ionic columns, and (originally) side yards. Another house was built at 170, several years later, in a similar style. They were widely imitated <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
5|$|In June 2013, former Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon {{signed a}} new foreign {{investment}} law.

50|$|Cargo {{tricycles}} {{are also}} used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Philippines and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> Asia. <b>The</b> cargo tricycle either has a bed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back or on the side as a sidecar.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usual practice <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Historia ecclesiastica, Bede provides no information about his sources for the Cædmon story. Since a similar paucity of sources is also characteristic of other stories from Whitby Abbey in his work, this may indicate that his knowledge of Cædmon's life was based on tradition current at his home monastery in (relatively) nearby Wearmouth-Jarrow.|$|E
5|$|In the mid 1800s, Venance Payot, a Chamonix naturalist, {{published}} {{a number of}} articles on the flora around the Mont Blanc area, including {{a list of the}} flowering plants, ferns mosses and lichens found at les Grands Mulets and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> massif around Chamonix and the Aosta Valley.|$|E
5|$|Like their English counterparts, Welsh {{universities}} {{are able to}} charge up to £9,000 a year in tuition fees. However, Welsh students can apply for fee grants of up to £5,190, {{in addition to a}} £3,810 loan to cover these costs. This system also applies to Welsh students who study <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|<b>Elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> Europe, <b>the</b> {{song was}} also a hit, {{reaching}} no. 7 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ukraine, no. 12 in Italy, no. 16 in Portugal, no. 17 in Spain and no. 40 Russia.|$|R

5|$|Massachusetts {{has avoided}} {{many forms of}} racial strife seen <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US, but {{examples}} such as the successful electoral showings of the nativist (mainly anti-Catholic) Know Nothings in the 1850s, the controversial Sacco and Vanzetti executions in the 1920s, and Boston's opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s show that the ethnic history of Massachusetts was not completely harmonious.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the area}} remains, however, {{one of the poorest}} in Britain. This is in spite of rising {{property}} prices and the extensive building of luxury apartments centred largely around the former dock areas and alongside the Thames. With rising costs <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> capital and the availability of brownfield land, the East End has become a desirable place for business.|$|E
50|$|Bitonto is {{well known}} for its {{production}} of extra virgin olive oil, which is exported to America and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> Europe. <b>The</b> city also produces wine, beer, cereals, almonds, and textiles.|$|R

5|$|Slightly {{more than}} 60 percent of Indiana's regiments mustered into service and trained at Indianapolis.

5|$|The {{executive}} branch {{is responsible for}} proposing legislation and a budget, executing the laws and guiding the foreign and internal policies of the republic.

Although the cabinet normally meets at the Banski dvori, occasionally its meetings are held <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|E
50|$|As {{the city}} {{expanded}} the downtown became less centralized and commerce spread to neighbouring streets. Government ministries, requiring larger offices, also went <b>elsewhere.</b> <b>In</b> 1959 <b>the</b> street's streetcar line was closed, further hurting business.|$|R
50|$|A {{private equity}} group {{purchased}} <b>the</b> company <b>in</b> 1985, and began relocating operations <b>elsewhere.</b> <b>In</b> 1987, <b>the</b> Gilbert & Bennett site was included {{as part of}} the Georgetown Historic District listing on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
