5|$|In 2006, Fischbach {{joined the}} Simons Foundation as the {{scientific}} director {{to oversee the}} Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative. The Simons Foundation is an organization founded by Jim Simons and his wife Marilyn, and has awarded $130 million for autism research as of 2008. As scientific director, Fischbach collaborates with mathematicians, engineers, chemists, and neuroscientists to try and understand autism more completely. Currently, Fischbach oversees research focusing on the neurobiology of autism and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> relate to finding a possible cure.|$|E
5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
5|$|The post-colonial {{discourse}} {{presented in}} Orientalism, also influenced post-colonial theology and post-colonial biblical criticism, by which method the analytical reader approaches a scripture {{from the perspective}} of a colonial reader. See: The Bible and Zionism: Invented Traditions, Archaeology and Post-colonialism in Palestineâ€“Israel (2007). Another book in this area is Postcolonial Theory (1998), by Leela Gandhi, explains Post-colonialism to <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be applied to the wider philosophical and intellectual context of history.|$|E

25|$|Anyone {{involved}} in {{education should be}} concerned about how overemphasis on the SAT is distorting educational priorities and practices, how the test is perceived by many as unfair, and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> have a devastating impact on the self-esteem and aspirations of young students.

25|$|In an originalist interpretation, if {{the meaning}} of the Constitution is static, then any ex post facto {{information}} (such as the opinions of the American people, American judges, or the judiciaries of any foreign country) is inherently valueless for interpretation of {{the meaning of}} the Constitution, and should not form any part of constitutional jurisprudence. The Constitution is thus fixed and has procedures defining <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be changed.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately neuroscientists {{would like}} to {{understand}} {{every aspect of the}} nervous system, including how it works, how it develops, how it malfunctions, and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be altered or repaired. The specific topics that form the main foci of research change over time, driven by an ever-expanding base of knowledge and the availability of increasingly sophisticated technical methods. Over the long term, improvements in technology have been the primary drivers of progress. Developments in electron microscopy, computers, electronics, functional brain imaging, and most recently genetics and genomics, have all been major drivers of progress.|$|E
25|$|As a 13-year-old {{high school}} student, Bowers's {{interests}} included reptiles, scouting, short-wave radio, Strombecker kit models of World War II airplanes, and rocks and minerals. During this time Bowers {{became interested in}} the written word. He received Raymond L. Ditmars' Reptiles of North America from his mother as a Christmas gift in 1952. According to Bowers, Ditmars, who was curator of reptiles at the New York Zoological Garden (Bronx Zoo), had a way of making just about anything sound fascinating. From such experiences, Bowers learned the power of the written word and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> spur one to a great enthusiasm for acquisition.|$|E
25|$|Operationalize {{means to}} put into operation. Operational {{definitions}} are also used to define system states {{in terms of a}} specific, publicly accessible process of preparation or validation testing, which is repeatable at will. For example, 100 degrees Celsius may be crudely defined by describing the process of heating water at sea level until it is observed to boil. An item like a brick, or even a photograph of a brick, may be defined in terms of <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be made. Likewise, iron may be defined in terms of the results of testing or measuring it in particular ways.|$|E

25|$|After the 2012 English cricket season had finished, Boyce {{set out to}} {{walk the}} length of Great Britain on a route from John o' Groats to Land's End {{in order to raise}} money and promote {{awareness}} for mental health charity Mind. Although not suffering himself, he was inspired to raise awareness about depression after the suicides of sportsmen Gary Speed and Peter Roebuck. He was also frustrated by people such as Piers Morgan showing a lack of comprehension about depression and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> impact on {{people from all walks of}} life. He started the walk in September and completed it in December. For part of the walk he was joined by fellow cricketers, including Paul Nixon.|$|E
25|$|Although Schenker himself usually {{presents}} his analyses in the generative direction, {{starting from}} the fundamental structure (Ursatz) to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, {{starting from the}} score and showing <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the Ursatz is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise. Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is subjective. There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst. The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.|$|E
25|$|At stake, beyond {{commercial}} {{speculation and}} financial profit, were {{the questions of}} when Cubism began, who {{led the way in}} its development, what distinguishes Cubist art, <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be defined and who can be called Cubist. By marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des IndÃ©pendants and Salon d'Automne, Kahnweiler's attempted to focus attention on Picasso and Braque, those who played a leading if independent {{role in the development of}} this new mode of expression. To some extent Kahnweiler had succeeded in his endeavor, prompting historians such as Douglas Cooper to coin the term â€˜trueâ€™ Cubism to describe the work of Picasso and Braque. The implied value judgement was intentional.|$|E
