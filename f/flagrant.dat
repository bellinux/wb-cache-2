5|$|As Warden, and {{afterwards}} Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 {{percent of the}} coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting even the most <b>flagrant</b> criminals could be extremely difficult. However, Newton proved equal to the task.|$|E
5|$|Kalonji's {{accession}} {{to the position}} of Mulopwe was heavily criticised even by many Luba in South Kasai. Kalonji remained popular among some groups, but lost the support of the South Kasaian évolués who saw his elevation as <b>flagrant</b> opportunism. Soon after his elevation, Kalonji was publicly condemned and disavowed by ten of South Kasai's 13 representatives in the Léopoldville parliament, beginning the disintegration of the secessionist state.|$|E
5|$|Cẩn's men {{helped to}} cowl the populace into voting for his brother. Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten, with pepper sauce and water often forced down their nostrils. The {{violations}} were particularly <b>flagrant</b> in Cẩn's area, {{which was the}} home of the Nguyễn Dynasty and a source of sympathy towards Bảo Đại. Cẩn ordered the police to arrest 1,200 people for political reasons in the week leading up to the vote. In Hội An, some people were killed in election day violence.|$|E
5|$|The fight {{began with}} a <b>flagrant</b> foul by Knicks guard Mardy Collins on Nuggets guard J. R. Smith in the closing seconds of the game. Several players joined in the confrontation, and began to make {{physical}} contact. The fight briefly spilled into the stands, and also stretched {{to the other end}} of the court. All ten players on the floor at the time were ejected after the altercation was finished. When suspensions were announced, seven players were suspended without pay for a combined total of 47 games.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately though, it was Heisuke Yanagawa's 10th Army which, on November 19, {{abruptly}} {{crossed the}} operation restriction line and began advancing on Nanking. In {{response to this}} <b>flagrant</b> act of insubordination, Matsui, it is claimed, made some effort to restrain Yanagawa, but he also insisted to the high command that marching on Nanking was the right course of action. On December 1 the Army General Staff finally came around and approved an operation against Nanking, though by then many of Japan's units in the field were already well on their way.|$|E
5|$|Unique among North American {{professional}} team sports, the National Hockey League (NHL) {{and most}} minor professional leagues in North America do not eject players outright for fighting (although they may {{do so for}} more <b>flagrant</b> violations {{as part of a}} fight) but major European and collegiate hockey leagues do, and multi-game suspensions may be added on top of the ejection. Therefore, the vast majority of fights occur in the NHL and other North American professional leagues.|$|E
5|$|In east–west relations, Douglas-Home {{continued}} his policy {{of keeping the}} Soviet Union at bay. In September 1971, after receiving no satisfactory results from negotiations with Gromyko about the <b>flagrant</b> activities of the KGB in Britain, he expelled 105 Soviet diplomats for spying. In addition to the furore arising from this, the Soviets felt that the British government's approach to negotiations on détente in Europe was over-cautious, even sceptical. Gromyko was nonetheless realistic enough to maintain a working relationship with the British government. Within days of the expulsions from London he and Douglas-Home met and discussed the Middle East and disarmament. In this sphere of foreign policy, Douglas-Home was widely judged a success.|$|E
5|$|The German {{government}} {{had been hoping}} that the Ottomans would enter the war to support them but the government in Istanbul was undecided. The Germanophile Ottoman War Minister, Enver Pasha, began conspiring with the German ambassador to bring the empire into the war. Attempts to secure widespread support in the government failed, so Enver decided conflict {{would have to be}} instigated. With the help of the Ottoman naval minister and German Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, Enver arranged for the Ottoman fleet to go out to sea on 29 October supposedly to perform maneuvers. They were to provoke Russian vessels into opening fire and then accuse them of inciting war. Instead, Souchon raided the Russian coast in a <b>flagrant</b> display of hostility, causing little lasting damage but enraging the Russians.|$|E
5|$|The {{logistics}} of the referendum were organised and supervised by Diệm's brother and confidant, Nhu, {{who was the}} leader of the family's secret Cần Lao party, which supplied the Ngôs' electoral base. Reports of violence and intimidation were widespread. During the referendum, Nhu's staff told voters to throw away the green ballots. Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten, with pepper sauce and water sometimes being forced into their nostrils. The violations were particularly <b>flagrant</b> in central Vietnam, a region over which another of Diệm's younger brothers, Ngô Đình Cẩn, ruled. Cẩn was based in the former imperial capital city of Huế, home of the Nguyễn Dynasty and a source of support for Bảo Đại. He stifled this support by ordering the police to arrest 1,200 people for political reasons in the week leading up to the vote. In the city of Hội An, several people were killed in election violence {{on the day of the}} poll. Voting started at 07:00 and ended at 17:00.|$|E
5|$|The {{first serious}} combat {{involving}} the Swiss Air Force began in June 1940. In {{six days of}} aerial battles, eleven German aircraft were downed, {{with a loss of}} two Swiss aircraft and three airmen killed. Following these incidents, on 6June, the chief of the Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring, protested the attacks, claiming that most of the German planes had been in French airspace and that the Luftwaffe had entered Swiss airspace only by mistake. Germany demanded financial compensation and an apology by the Swiss government. In a second, more pointed demand on 19June, Germany stated that they viewed the air battles as a <b>flagrant</b> act of aggression, and if these interceptions continued, Switzerland would face sanctions and retaliation. The next day, General Henri Guisan ordered all Swiss units to stop engaging foreign aircraft, and on 1July 1940, the Federal Council apologized for possible border violations by Swiss pilots, without admitting any had occurred. On 16 July, the German government declared that the events were settled. Engaging aircraft of the combatant nations was prohibited until October 1943, when strategic bombing of Bavaria and Austria by the Allies became an increasing likelihood.|$|E

25|$|Anthony Espiritu of the UST Growling Tigers was {{supposedly}} suspended on Game 3 of the Finals due to two <b>flagrant</b> fouls on Game 2 but was instead given a warning by the UAAP Board.|$|E
25|$|He was {{suspended}} for Game 2 of the team's first-round series against the San Antonio Spurs following a <b>flagrant</b> foul (elbow to the head) on Manu Ginóbili. The Kings eventually were eliminated from the playoffs in six games.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a second}} {{category}} of fouls called technical fouls, which may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record {{a player in the}} scorebook, or for unsportsmanlike conduct. These infractions result in one or two free throws, which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time. Repeated incidents can result in disqualification. A blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (<b>flagrant</b> foul in the NBA). In FIBA, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the NBA, such a foul is referred to as <b>flagrant.</b>|$|E
25|$|L1 {{penalties}} concern {{areas of}} minimum heights and weights, the Laser Inspection Station (LIS), gear ratios, and <b>flagrant</b> lug nut violations where 17 or fewer are properly secured. Penalties {{will be a}} 10-40 point deduction, suspension for 1-3 races, plus a fine up to $75,000.|$|E

25|$|The Nuggets routed the Hornets in Game 1, led by {{hometown}} player Chauncey Billups's 36 {{points in}} his playoff debut for the Nuggets. He sank a career playoff-high 8 three-pointers and added 8 assists in the game. He continued his form in Game 2, scoring 31 points as the Nuggets took a 2–0 {{lead in the}} series. The Hornets bounced back with a victory in Game 3. Game 3 was marked with plenty of fouls, {{with a total of}} 58 personal fouls in the game, resulting in four players fouling out of the game, David West and Tyson Chandler for the Hornets, and Kenyon Martin and Nenê for the Nuggets. The referees also called three <b>flagrant</b> fouls from James Posey, Chandler and Billups. Hornets' head coach Byron Scott was also called for a technical foul after arguing on Posey's <b>flagrant</b> foul.|$|E
25|$|With SLR on a fouling spree to {{conserve}} time on Game 4, Yeo committed a <b>flagrant</b> foul (penalty 2) {{when he hit}} Noy Castillo in the face. Yeo and Castillo then had a shouting spree before Castillo missed his two free throws. This would assure that Yeo will miss Game 5 along with James Yap.|$|E
25|$|Dwyane Wade shined {{again for}} the Heat with 36 points, and Miami held Dallas to just seven points {{in the fourth quarter}} en route to a series-tying, blowout victory. The Mavericks' low-scoring fourth quarter was the lowest ever by any team during the NBA Finals. Jerry Stackhouse caught Shaquille O'Neal with a <b>flagrant</b> foul that {{resulted}} in him being suspended for Game 5.|$|E
25|$|In a statement, Rovers accused Sainsbury's of {{breaking}} its promises. It described {{the decision as}} a 'kick in the teeth' {{for the people of}} Bristol. The club claimed that it was abundantly clear throughout the case that Sainsbury's reneged on its promises to the local community to invest in the region and showed a <b>flagrant</b> disregard for the terms of the contract.|$|E
25|$|Game 5 {{was marked}} by several hard fouls and {{technical}} fouls. Dwyane Wade was fouled and sent tumbling down by Solomon Jones before a skirmish between Wade, Jones, Jamaal Magloire and Josh Smith started. All four players were given technical fouls in the incident. Wade was later called for a <b>flagrant</b> foul after he fouled Maurice Evans during a layup attempt. The <b>flagrant</b> foul was later rescinded by the officials after they reviewed the play. The Hawks finally won the game, despite losing starting center Al Horford due to injury in the second quarter. The Heat evened the series at 3–3 after winning Game 6. Wade scored 41 points to lead the Heat to a 26-point rout over the Hawks. The Hawks finally won the series after winning Game 7 at home, with 13 points difference. All seven games of the series were decided by at least 10 points, with an average margin of 19 points.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{rivalry with}} the Miami Heat was {{triggered}} {{with the team}} in the Eastern Conference Semifinals of the 2012 NBA Playoffs. The two previously met in the 2004 NBA Playoffs (when Indiana won 4–2). , the only player still left from either team is Udonis Haslem of the Heat. Both head coaches were fined for statements made relating to the officiating: Frank Vogel accused the Heat of flopping before the series started, while Erik Spoelstra took offense to what he perceived to be deliberate head-hunting of his players {{on the part of}} the Pacers. Indiana took a 2–1 lead after Miami's Chris Bosh was sidelined with an abdominal strain. Powered by LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, Miami won three straight games to take the series, 4–2. The series was marked by several suspensions, <b>flagrant</b> fouls, and confrontations between the players: Tyler Hansbrough's <b>flagrant</b> foul on Dwyane Wade (which drew blood), Udonis Haslem's retaliatory <b>flagrant</b> foul on Hansborough (which led to Haslem's Game 6 suspension), Wade colliding with Darren Collison in transition, Juwan Howard confronting Lance Stephenson over the latter's flashing of the choke sign to James, and Dexter Pittman elbowing Stephenson in the neck (which led to his own three-game suspension). Indiana's Danny Granger received technical fouls in three consecutive games for his confrontations with Heat players; he stripped James of his headband in Game 2 while attempting to block a shot, pulled the back of James' jersey in Game 3 while trying to stop a fast-break, and chest-bumped Wade in Game 4 after the latter was fouled by Roy Hibbert.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasion}} of Panama provoked international outrage. Some countries {{charged that the}} U.S. had committed an act of aggression by invading Panama {{and was trying to}} conceal a new manifestation of its interventionist policy of force in Latin America. On 29 December, the General Assembly of the United Nations voted 75–20, with 40 abstentions, to condemn the invasion as a <b>flagrant</b> violation of international law.|$|E
25|$|Conflicts {{have arisen}} in the United States on federally-designated beaches, which are {{nevertheless}} patrolled by local police, {{since there is}} no federal law against nudity in these areas, but there may well be local ones.

25|$|A recent rivalry was {{triggered}} with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Semifinals of the 2012 NBA Playoffs. Although the two previously {{met in the}} 2004 NBA Playoffs (when Indiana won 4–2), as of 2014, the only two players still left from either team are Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem of the Heat.

25|$|On April 25, 2016, the Mavericks {{were once}} again knocked {{out of the first}} round, this time by the Oklahoma City Thunder in a 4–1 series loss. After {{managing}} to win a game at OKC and tying the series 1–1, the Mavericks lost three straight to lose the series. This series was marked by physicality by both teams, including a Kevin Durant <b>Flagrant</b> 2 foul and several Mavericks playing very defensively on Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.|$|E
25|$|On {{the college}} level in a dual meet, the wrestler not only wins the match for himself, but also gains points for his team.

25|$|The general {{result of}} the {{investigation}} has been to disclose the existence of numerous and <b>flagrant</b> discriminations by the railroads in behalf of the Standard Oil Co. and its affiliated corporations. With comparatively few exceptions, mainly of other large concerns in California, the Standard has been the sole beneficiary of such discriminations. In almost every section {{of the country that}} company has been found to enjoy some unfair advantages over its competitors, and some of these discriminations affect enormous areas.|$|E
25|$|The Horsa {{was first}} {{deployed}} operationally {{on the night}} of 19/20 November 1942 in the unsuccessful attack on the German Heavy Water Plant at Rjukan in Norway (Operation Freshman). The two Horsa gliders, each carrying 15 sappers, and one of the Halifax tug aircraft crashed in Norway due to bad weather. All 23 survivors from the glider crashes were executed on the orders of Adolf Hitler, in a <b>flagrant</b> breach of the Geneva Convention which protects prisoners of war (POWs) from summary execution.|$|E
25|$|Gates v.

25|$|In 1969–70, Obote {{published}} {{a series of}} pamphlets {{that were supposed to}} outline his political and economic policy. The Common Man's Charter was a summary of his approach to socialism, which became known as the Move to the Left. The government took over a 60% share in major private corporations and banks in the country in 1970. During Obote's regime, <b>flagrant</b> and widespread corruption emerged in the name of socialism. Food shortages sent prices through the ceiling. Obote's persecution of Indian traders contributed to this rise in prices.|$|E
25|$|Nintendo of America {{took the}} same stance against the {{distribution}} of SNES ROM image files {{and the use of}} emulators as it did with the NES, insisting that they represented <b>flagrant</b> software piracy.
