5|$|Paul W. Fairman {{replaced}} Browne {{as editor}} in September 1956. Early in Fairman's tenure, Bernard Davis {{decided to try}} issuing a companion series of novels, titled Amazing Stories Science Fiction Novels. Readers' letters in Amazing had indicated a desire for novels, which Amazing did not <b>have</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> run. The novel series did not last; only one, Henry Slesar's 20 Million Miles to Earth, appeared. However, in response to readers' interest in longer fiction, Ziff-Davis expanded Amazing by 16 pages, starting with the March 1958 issue, and the magazine began to run complete novels.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} of the Battle of the Somme led the German command {{to conclude that the}} policy of rigidly defending a trench position line was no longer effective against the firepower that the Entente armies had accumulated. Ludendorff published a new defensive doctrine in December 1916, in which deeper defences were to be built, within which the garrison would <b>have</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> manoeuvre, rather than rigidly holding successive lines of trenches. Along Vimy Ridge, the German forces spent two years constructing fortifications designed for rigid defence. Little reconstruction based upon the new defence-in-depth doctrine had been accomplished by April 1917 because the terrain made it impractical.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of types of {{legislation}} which can be passed. The strongest is a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence <b>have</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person/group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding declarations.|$|E

5|$|The {{few other}} areas that operate the special {{legislative}} procedures are justice & home affairs, budget and taxation and {{certain aspects of}} other policy areas: such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone. The procedure used also depends upon which type of institutional act is being used. The strongest act is a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety.

Europe does not <b>have</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> ease fiscal or monetary policy, the 30-nation group warned. For the eurozone, the OECD now forecasts first-quarter GDP growth of just 0.5%, with no improvement in the second quarter, which is expected to show just a 0.4% gain.|$|E
25|$|The Shar Pei's {{loose skin}} and {{extremely}} prickly coat were originally developed {{to help the}} dogs fend off wild boar, as {{they were used to}} hunt. Later, the breed was used for dog fighting; these enhanced traits made the Shar Pei difficult for its opponent to grab and hold on to, and so that if it did manage to hold on, the Shar Pei would still <b>have</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> maneuver and bite back; when grabbed by any loose wrinkle, a Shar Pei can actually twist in their skin and face in their opponent's direction. In fighting, they would twist in their skin to bite the assailant back.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the film's 2008 release, Hayden Christensen {{reflected}} {{on the possibility of}} one or more sequels: [...] "This has definitely been set up {{in a way that will}} allow for more films, and Doug has been careful to make sure that he's created characters that will <b>have</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> grow." [...] Lucas Foster during production of the film stated in an interview: [...] "The ideas got so large, that they really couldn't fit into, you know, one or two movies, they needed to evolve over at least three movies. So we planned the story out over three movies and then we sliced it up in such a way as to leave room for the other two movies." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) becomes {{engaged to}} her state senator boyfriend, Robert. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who {{strongly}} believes that Robert is gay, shares his feelings with Pam. Ryan overhears them and confirms that Robert is gay, in his opinion. When {{the rest of}} the office thinks so as well, they must {{decide whether or not to}} tell Angela. They eventually decide not to tell Angela for a wide range of reasons—not everyone is sure Robert is gay, Oscar is looking forward to the elegant wedding, and Pam does not think it is anyone's right to blurt out that information. Angela is then typically rude about her nuptial plans—first sing-songing to an indifferent Stanley that they might not <b>have</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> invite him to the wedding, and then asking Pam if she can borrow the plans for the dream wedding Pam never got to have, before mocking the ceremony where Pam and Jim got married at Niagara Falls. Pam is sorely tempted to spill the beans about Robert's sexuality, but ends up smiling sweetly and wishing Angela [...] "a very happy wedding".|$|E

Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding, declarations. There is a further document which does not follow normal procedures, this is a [...] "written declaration" [...] {{which is similar to}} an early day motion used in the Westminster system. It is a document proposed by up to five MEPs on a matter within the EU's activities used to launch a debate on that subject. Having been posted outside the entrance to the hemicycle, members can sign the declaration and if a majority do so it is forwarded to the President and announced to the plenary before being forwarded to the other institutions and formally noted in the minutes.|$|E

500|$|In September 2015, after Marvel Studios was {{integrated}} into The Walt Disney Studios with Feige reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter, {{it was reported}} that the studios' creative committee would have [...] "nominal" [...] input on the films moving forward, though would continue to consult on Marvel Television productions, which remained under Perlmutter's control. All key film decisions going forward will be made by Feige, D'Esposito and Victoria Alonso. At the end of the month, on how much story is developed for future films of the universe, Feige said there are [...] "broad strokes" [...] though sometime [...] "super-specific things. But for the most part, in broad strokes that are broad enough and loose enough that, if through the development of four of five movies {{before we get to the}} culmination ... we still <b>have</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> sway and to move and to go and to surprise ourselves in places that we end up. So that all the movies, hopefully when they're finished, will feel like they're all interconnected and meant to be and planned far ahead, but really can live and breathe enough as individual movies to be satisfying each and of themselves." [...] The studio also has various contingency plans for the direction of all of their films, in the event they are unable to secure a certain actor to reprise a role, or re-acquire the film rights to a character, such as was done in February 2015 with Spider-Man.|$|E

As a result, the terriers often weigh considerably less than the fox (10kg/22lbs) and badger (12kg/26lbs), making these animals formidable quarry for the smaller dog.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the oldest}} and best-known coils still in {{operation}} is the [...] "GPO-1" [...] at Griffith Park Observatory in Los Angeles. It was originally one of a pair of coils built in 1910 by Earle L. Ovington, a friend of Tesla and manufacturer of high voltage electrotherapy apparatus. For a number of years Ovington displayed them at the December electrical trade show at Madison Square Garden in New York City, using them for demonstrations of high voltage science, which Tesla himself sometimes attended. [...] Called the Million Volt Oscillator, the twin coils were installed on the balcony at the show. Every hour the lights were dimmed and the public was treated to a display of 10 foot arcs. [...] Ovington gave the coils to his friend Dr. Frederick Finch Strong, a leading figure in the alternative health field of electrotherapy. In 1937 Strong donated the coils to the Griffith Observatory. The museum didn't <b>have</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> display both, but one coil was restored by Kenneth Strickfaden and has been in daily operation ever since. It consists of a 48 in. (1.2 m) high conical secondary coil topped by a 12 in. (30cm) diameter copper ball electrode, with a 9-turn spiral primary of 2 in. copper strip, a glass plate capacitor (replacing the original Leyden jars), and rotary spark gap. Its output has been estimated at 1.3 million volts.|$|E
