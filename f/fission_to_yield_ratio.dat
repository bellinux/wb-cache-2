40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} reducing leaf area by shoot hedging in combination with bunch thinning on metabolite concentration and sensorial quality of Sauvignon blanc grapes and wines. Methods and results: Four vine treatments were conducted: shoot hedging/bunch thinning (SH/BT), shoot hedging/no bunch thinning (SH/NBT), full canopy/bunch thinning (FC/BT) and full canopy/no bunch thinning (FC/NBT). Shoot hedging delayed total soluble solids accumulation {{at the beginning of}} the grape maturation in SH/BT and SH/NBT treatments. At harvest there were no significant differences in the concentration of hydroxycinnamoyl tartaric acids, glutathione, total soluble solids, titratable acidity and pH value in grape juice between all treatments and methoxypyrazines were below the limit of detection. Lutein concentration in grape berry was higher in treatments without bunch thinning, while there was no significant difference in the concentration of β-carotene and neoxanthin. The highest leaf area <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> <b>ratio</b> (FC/BT) resulted in higher concentration of glutathione in must and higher concentration of thiols in Sauvignon blanc wines. Upon sensory evaluation, the FC/BT wine was best scored for overall quality and heavier tropical aroma, whereas the FC/NBT wine was best scored for fresh tropical aroma and second best for overall quality. Conclusion: Leaf area <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> <b>ratio</b> impacted beny ripening kinetics, grape and wine metabolite composition, and sensorial properties of Sauvignon blanc wine. Signiricance and impact of the study: The shidy showed that the highest leaf area <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> <b>ratio</b> resulted in the best overall sensorial quality of wine. © Vigne et Vin Publications Internationales (Bordeaux, France) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Evaluation {{of contact}} pressure, surface and {{subsurface}} contact stresses {{are essential to}} know the functional response of surface coatings and the contact behavior mainly depends on surface roughness, material property, thickness of layer and the manner of loading. Contact parameter evaluation of real rough surface contacts mostly relies on statistical single asperity contact approaches. In this work, a three dimensional layered solid rough surface in contact with a rigid flat is modeled and analyzed using finite element method. The rough surface of layered solid is generated by FFT approach. The generated rough surface is exported to a finite element method based ANSYS package through which the bottom up solid modeling is employed to create a deformable solid model with a layered solid rough surface on top. The discretization and contact analysis are carried by using the same ANSYS package. The elastic, elastoplastic and plastic deformations are continuous in the present finite element method unlike many other contact models. The Young’s modulus <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> strength <b>ratio</b> of layer is varied in the present work to observe the contact parameters effect while keeping the surface roughness and substrate material properties as constant. The contacting asperities attain elastic, elastoplastic and plastic states with their continuity and asperity interaction phenomena is inherently included.

Relative probability and immediacy of reinforcement {{in the terminal}} links were both varied, and outcomes on individual trials (reinforcement or nonreinforcement) were either signaled or unsignaled. Terminal-link fixed-time schedules were varied across components within conditions <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> immediacy <b>ratios</b> of 1 ∶ 2, 1 ∶ 1 and 2 ∶ 1. The probabilities of reinforcement were varied across conditions <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> reinforcer <b>ratios</b> of 1 ∶ 5, 1 ∶ 2, 2 ∶ 1 and 5 ∶ 1. Results showed that a model based on the generalized matching law provided a good description of response allocation, accounting for 92 % of the variance overall. As expected, sensitivity to probability was greater in the unsignaled conditions. However, sensitivity to immediacy was also greater in the unsignaled conditions, suggesting {{that the effect of}} signaling terminal-link outcomes may not be limited to probability but apply to reinforcer variables in general. The effects of signaling can be explained in terms of conditioned reinforcement added to each alternative's outcomes in the matching law. There was some evidence for an interaction between reinforcer probability and immediacy, particularly for the dependent-schedules group, such that sensitivity to immediacy was greater at moderate rather than extreme reinforcer ratios. However, further analysis suggested that this could have been due to a ceiling effect on response allocation imposed by dependent scheduling. Overall, the present results show that the generalized matching law can provide a useful account of choice between outcomes that vary in both probability and immediacy of reinforcement...|$|R

In Experiment 2, milk (39. 60 versus 40. 46 kg/d; P= 0. 02), milk fat (1. 40 versus 1. 47 kg/d; P< 0. 01) and milk protein yield (1. 10 versus 1. 16 kg/d; P< 0. 01), as well as milk energy output (113. 2 versus 117. 8 MJ/d; P< 0. 01) were all higher with B vitamin feeding.

Tipping increased percent fruit set, berries per cluster, cluster weight, and <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> pruning <b>ratio</b> in both seasons. Shoot tip removal increased early shoot growth in the second season, main and lateral leaf size, and the contribution of lateral leaves to total leaf area. Tipping decreased the number of shoots per vine in the second season, clusters per vine in both seasons, must soluble solids, total amount of sugar exported with fruit harvest, leaf area per vine, pruning weight, and cane weight and length at mid-ripening. Increasing lateral shoot length increased must soluble solids in both seasons and dormant cane diameter the following winter. Vines with long laterals had lower <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> pruning <b>ratios</b> in the first season. Percent fruit set increased only {{in the absence of}} vegetative growing tips, either from the main or from lateral shoots. Leaf removal in the cluster zone four weeks after bloom had no impact on yield components but reduced must soluble solids in both seasons. It also reduced <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> pruning <b>ratios</b> in the first season and dormant cane diameter in the second season. Non-structural carbohydrate concentration in the permanent structure was not affected by any of the treatments but total content in the trunk increased with increasing lateral shoot length...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{abundance}} ratios and their relation to stellar nucleosynthesis and other parameters of chemical evolution models, reviewing and clarifying the correct use of the observed abundance ratios in several astrophysical contests. In particular, we start from the well known fact that abundance ratios depend on stellar yields, initial mass function and stellar lifetimes and we show, by means of specific examples, {{that in some cases}} it is not correct to infer constraints on the contributions from different SN types (Ia, II), and particularly on different sets of yields, {{in the absence of a}} complete chemical evolution model taking into account stellar lifetimes. In spite of the fact that some of these results should be well known, we believe that it is useful to discuss the meaning of abundance ratios in the light of severel recent claims based upon an incorrect interpretation of observed abundance ratios. In particular, the procedure, often used in the recent literature, of deriving directly conclusions about stellar nucleosynthesis, just by relating abundance <b>ratios</b> <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> <b>ratios,</b> implicitly assumes the instantaneous recycling approximation (I. R. A.). This approximation is clearly not correct when one analyzes the contributions of SNIa relative to SNII as functions of cosmic time. In this paper we show that the uncertainty which arises from adopting this oversimplified procedure in a variety of astrophysical objects, such as elliptical galaxies, the intracluster medium and high redshift objects, does not allow us to draw any firm conclusion, and that the differences between abundance ratios predicted by models with I. R. A. and models with detailed stellar lifetimes is of the same order as the differences between different sets of yields. (Abridged) Comment: 12 pages (including figures), to appear in PAS...|$|R
