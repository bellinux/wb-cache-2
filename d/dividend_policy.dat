25|$|A self-inflicted {{wound was}} the VOC's <b>dividend</b> <b>policy.</b> The {{dividends}} {{distributed by the}} company had exceeded the surplus it garnered in Europe in every decade but one (1710–1720) from 1690 to 1760. However, in the period up to 1730 the directors shipped resources to Asia {{to build up the}} trading capital there. Consolidated bookkeeping therefore probably would have shown that total profits exceeded dividends. In addition, between 1700 and 1740 the company retired 5.4 million guilders of long-term debt. The company therefore was still on a secure financial footing in these years. This changed after 1730. While profits plummeted the bewindhebbers only slightly decreased dividends from the earlier level. Distributed dividends were therefore in excess of earnings in every decade but one (1760–1770). To accomplish this, the Asian capital stock had to be drawn down by 4 million guilders between 1730 and 1780, and the liquid capital available in Europe was reduced by 20 million guilders in the same period. The directors were therefore constrained to replenish the company's liquidity by resorting to short-term financing from anticipatory loans, backed by expected revenues from home-bound fleets.|$|E

Furthermore, the impact of foreign directors is also examined. The findings show that institutional and foreign directors on boards affect <b>dividend</b> <b>policies</b> positively, suggesting that these directors are more likely to mitigate agency costs. Additionally, the results report the relevant monitoring role that pressure-sensitive directors play, since they impact positively on <b>dividend</b> <b>policies,</b> while pressure-resistant directors show no effect.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} dividend remittances {{by a large}} {{panel of}} foreign affiliates of U. S. multinational firms. The <b>dividend</b> <b>policies</b> of foreign affiliates, which convey no signals to public capital markets, nevertheless resemble those used by publicly held companies in paying dividends to diffuse common shareholders. Robustness checks verify that <b>dividend</b> <b>policies</b> of foreign affiliates are little affected by the <b>dividend</b> <b>policies</b> of their parent companies or parent company exposure to public capital markets. Systematic differences in the payout behavior of affiliates that differ in organizational form, and those that face differing tax costs of paying dividends, reveal the importance of tax factors; nevertheless, <b>dividend</b> <b>policies</b> are not solely determined by tax considerations. The absence of capital market considerations and the incompleteness of tax explanations together suggest that <b>dividend</b> <b>policies</b> are largely driven {{by the need to}} control managers of foreign affiliates. Parent firms are more willing to incur tax penalties by simultaneously investing funds while receiving dividends when their foreign affiliates are partially owned, located far from the United States, or in jurisdictions in which property rights are weak, all of which are implied by control theories of dividends. ...|$|R
2500|$|Management {{must also}} choose {{the form of}} the {{dividend}} distribution, generally as cash dividends or via a share buyback. Various factors may be taken into consideration: where shareholders must pay tax on dividends, firms may elect to retain earnings or to perform a stock buyback, in both cases increasing the value of shares outstanding. Alternatively, some companies will pay [...] "dividends" [...] from stock rather than in cash; see Corporate action. [...] Financial theory suggests that the <b>dividend</b> <b>policy</b> should be set based upon the type of company and what management determines is the best use of those dividend resources for the firm to its shareholders. [...] As a general rule, shareholders of growth companies would prefer managers to retain earnings and pay no dividends (use excess cash to reinvest into the company's operations), whereas shareholders of value or secondary stocks would prefer the management of these companies to payout surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends when a positive return cannot be earned through the reinvestment of undistributed earnings. [...] A share buyback program may be accepted when the value of the stock is greater than the returns to be realized from the reinvestment of undistributed profits. [...] In all instances, the appropriate <b>dividend</b> <b>policy</b> is usually directed by that which maximizes long-term shareholder value.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dividend</b> <b>policy</b> is {{concerned}} with financial policies regarding the payment of a cash dividend in the present or paying an increased dividend at a later stage. [...] Whether to issue dividends, and what amount, is determined mainly {{on the basis of}} the company's unappropriated profit (excess cash) and influenced by the company's long-term earning power. When cash surplus exists and is not needed by the firm, then management is expected to pay out some or all of those surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends or to repurchase the company's stock through a share buyback program.|$|E

40|$|Why did the U. S. and U. K.

While firms in both countries maintained liberal <b>dividend</b> <b>policies</b> during the nineteenth century, U.

In subsequent years, both countries have undergone major corporate tax reforms during periods of concern about the direction of firm <b>dividend</b> <b>policies</b> in their respective countries.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effects of investment opportunities and corporate finance on <b>dividend</b> payout <b>policy.</b> Design/methodology/approach – This issue is tested with a sample of 34 emerging market countries covering a 17 -year period, 1990 - 2006.

There are, however, insignificant effects of the various measures of corporate finance namely, financial leverage, external financing, and debt maturity on <b>dividend</b> payout <b>policy.</b> Profitability and stock market capitalization are also identified as important in influencing <b>dividend</b> payout <b>policy.</b> Profitable firms are more likely to support high dividend payments to shareholders.
