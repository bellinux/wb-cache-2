25|$|During {{the first}} episode of series three of Ashes to Ashes, {{the nature of his}} death is raised when Alex Drake discovers a witness {{statement}} implied to have been written by Gene Hunt with various parts blacked out, accompanied by Alex seeing visions of a man with injuries to {{the left side of his}} face dressed in police tunic and greatcoat. In the second episode, DCI Jim Keats, an officer from the <b>Discipline</b> <b>and</b> <b>Complaints</b> department, intent on removing Gene Hunt, states he believes Gene killed Sam Tyler. In the fifth episode, Gene destroys Tyler's clothes (which Alex had requested from Manchester) and the censored file in order to prevent her from learning the truth about his death. In the following episode, a suspect who is not only a known fantasist but appears very different physically from Sam tries to convince Alex that he is Sam Tyler after undergoing extensive plastic surgery, and that he is from the future. He quotes Sam's usual speech in the Life on Mars introductions, claiming that nobody else is real, although he still seems to be pleased when he, Gene and Alex are in the same room, calling them the 'Three Musketeers', and avoiding Alex's attempts to test him for future knowledge by claiming that such details are forgotten after too long in the past. Gene tells Alex that he helped Sam fake his own death, meaning Sam was still alive but had disappeared into thin air.|$|E

50|$|In {{the third}} and final series, set yet another year forward in 1983, DCI Gene Hunt, DI Alex Drake {{and the rest of the}} team all return, joined by a new addition, DCI Jim Keats, a <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> <b>complaints</b> officer. Alex returns to the 1980s after being brought round by Gene, and she comes to believe the 2008 she woke up in was only a dream. Her {{connection}} to the present seems weaker than before, while Hunt is trying to stop his department crumbling from within due to Keats' presence. Although Jim is ostensibly friendly with Hunt's officers, he makes no effort to conceal his hatred of Gene when the two are alone, and attempts to turn Alex against him. Prompted by the haunting of a dead policeman and visions of stars, Alex becomes suspicious of the role Gene played in Sam Tyler's death following his return to the past, and, urged on by Jim, she eventually discovers the truth of Gene Hunt, her colleagues and the world she has been transported to.|$|E
