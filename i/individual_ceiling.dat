40|$|OBJECTIVE: The Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) is {{a widely}} used measure of {{everyday}} memory performance. In the most recent revision of this test (RBMT- 3) some important changes have been made compared with the RBMT. This study examines whether this revision has improved {{the quality of the}} clinical classifications using this test, as well as the frequency of floor and ceiling performances that were prominent on some subtests of the RBMT, using a heterogeneous study sample. METHODS: Twenty-five healthy adults and 25 patients with alcohol-related memory impairment (including 15 Korsakoff patients) were examined using both the RBMT and the RBMT- 3. The number of perfect scores and floor performances, as well as the percentage of individuals classified as impaired (< 5 th percentile), were scored and compared. RESULTS: Administration of the RBMT- 3 results in less participants performing at or near <b>individual</b> subtest's <b>ceiling,</b> and resulted in less floor performances. Moreover, the RBMT- 3 misclassifies less healthy participants as impaired than the RBMT. CONCLUSIONS: The RBMT- 3 is a substantial improvement over the original RBMT, as it reduces the problem of ceiling and floor performances and the number of misclassifications. However, more research is needed on the ecological validity of the RBMT- 3...|$|R
40|$|Designed to {{contribute}} to {{an assessment of the}} effects of the second agreement with general practitioners, the study analyzes the effects produced on the medical practices of general practitioners by pay range of a) the <b>individual</b> income <b>ceiling</b> and b) various types of fee restrictions on supplementary medical procedures provided under the agreement. The methodology used consisted basically in analyzing the variations of selected indicators of professional activity and medical practice among general practitioners by pay range following the implementation of the second agreement. Control groups were used to facilitate the assessment of other factors that may have influenced the variations referred to. The study shows that the income ceiling has resulted in a significant slowdown in the professional activity of general practitioners whose income had been in excess of the income ceiling in the year preceding the agreement. The shorter work period was accompanied by a longer vacation period. From the second part of the study it appears that the implementation of the second agreement has also appreciably reduced differences in medical procedures by pay range. The fee restrictions on supplementary procedures have produced a very considerable drop in the number of supplementary procedures performed by general practitioners in the top pay ranges, whereas in the past such procedures had been particularly prevalent in those pay ranges...|$|R

40|$|The {{capacity}} to reorient in one’s environment {{is a fundamental}} part of the spatial cognitive systems of both humans and nonhuman species. Abundant literature has shown that human adults and toddlers, rats, chicks, and fish accomplish reorientation through the construction and use of geometric representations of surrounding layouts, including the lengths of surfaces and their intersection. Does {{the development of this}} reorientation system rely on specific genes and their action in brain development? We tested reorientation in individuals who have Williams syndrome (WS), a genetic disorder that results in abnormalities of hippocampal and parietal areas of the brain known to be involved in reorientation. We found that in a rectangular chamber devoid of surface feature information, WS individuals do not use the geometry of the chamber to reorient, failing to find a hidden object. The failure among people with WS cannot be explained by more general deficits in visual-spatial working memory, as the same <b>individuals</b> performed at <b>ceiling</b> in a similar task in which they were not disoriented. We also found that performance among people with WS improves in a rectangular chamber with one blue wall, suggesting that some individuals with WS can use the blue wall feature to locate the hidden object. These results show that the geometric system used for reorientation in humans can be selectively damaged by specific genetic and neural abnormalities in humans...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the attentional blink (AB) under conditions where attention was directed {{either to the}} overall (global) or to the component (local) form of compound Navon letters. Forty-five adult participants were presented RSVP sequences of compound letter stimuli {{and were asked to}} identify the prescribed attentional aspect of a red target letter (T 1) and to detect the presence of a second item (T 2 = letter X), again of specified global or local aspect. Trials were presented at either four or six letter forms per second (f/s). We report that the AB estimated from the mean performance across participants is much longer (1. 5 - 2. 5 s) than that reported previously with single letter RSVP (200 - 500 ms). A lag- 1 sparing effect was not observed when data were filtered for correct identification of T 1. Characteristic rapid (initial) and slower (later) recovery phases suggested the use of a bilinear (&#x 201 C;knee&#x 201 D;) recovery model, possibly identifying a novel slow recovery mechanism for the AB when its duration is sufficiently long. However, it is proposed that the duration of the AB should be analyzed by estimation of each individual's AB prior to group analysis. Analysis of individual bilinear fits to the data shows a significant effect of attentional condition for the 4 f/s data, with more rapid recovery for Global-Global (GG) than Local-Local (LL) target conditions, consistent with the global precedence hypothesis. While the 6 f/s data did not demonstrate such differences between attentional conditions, it was at the expense of T 1 identification performance with significantly poorer T 1 identification for the LL cf GG conditions. Individual fits also demonstrate that the later slow recovery phase seen in the population mean data is clearly a result of pooling of the data from <b>individuals</b> reaching <b>ceiling</b> performance in recovery at different times. Analysis of the trials in which T 1 was incorrectly identified yielded an attentional blink for T 2 with delayed recovery and a manifest lag- 1 sparing effect. This suggests, in the framework of the two stage model, that the duration of gate opening for target recognition requires sufficient certainty of recognition prior to closure, rather than being a fixed, process-related time...|$|R
40|$|Background: It {{has been}} argued that agrammatic speakers' {{production}} of sentences in derived order is impaired (The Derived Order Problem Hypothesis, DOP-H), and that the underlying deficit in bilingual individuals with agrammatic Broca's aphasia may cause different surface manifestations in the languages when they differ in terms of their grammatical morphology. The current study presents results of a study on sentence production in Swahili-English bilingual agrammatic speakers. The two languages, Swahili and English, differ significantly in terms of their verbal morphology. Aims: The current study tested the production of sentences in base and derived orders of arguments in the two languages of Swahili-English bilingual agrammatic speakers. Methods & Procedures: Eight agrammatic and eight non-brain damaged individuals participated in the study. A sentence elicitation test was used to examine the production of sentences in base and derived word orders in Swahili and English. The base order condition consisted of active and subject-cleft sentences, whereas the derived order condition tested passive and object-cleft sentences. Outcomes & Results: The non-brain-damaged <b>individuals</b> performed at <b>ceiling</b> in both languages. The agrammatic speakers' results, however, show sentences in derived order condition and were more difficult to produce than those in base order, similarly across the two languages irrespective of their morphological differences. Moreover, the embedded sentences were also more difficult to produce than simple sentences for agrammatic speakers. Conclusions: The current data partially support the DOP-H and provide new insight into sentence production deficit of bilingual individuals with agrammatic Broca's aphasia. The findings are discussed with respect to the theories of sentence production in agrammatic speakers. ...|$|R

Tutors: Josep Fortiana i Jordi AlonsoObjective: Health status {{measures}} {{usually have}} an asymmetric distribution and present {{a high percentage}} of respondents with the best possible score (ceiling effect), specially when they are assessed in the overall population. Different methods to model this type of variables have been proposed that take into account the ceiling effect: the tobit models, the Censored Least Absolute Deviations (CLAD) models or the two-part models, among others. The objective of this work was to describe the tobit model, and compare it with the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, that ignores the ceiling effect. Methods: Two different data sets have been used in order to compare both models: a) real data comming from the European Study of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD), in order to model the EQ 5 D index, one of the measures of utilities most commonly used for the evaluation of health status; and b) data obtained from simulation. Cross-validation was used to compare the predicted values of the tobit model and the OLS models. The following estimators were compared: the percentage of absolute error (R 1), the percentage of squared error (R 2), the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Mean Absolute Prediction Error (MAPE). Different datasets were created for different values of the error variance and different percentages of <b>individuals</b> with <b>ceiling</b> effect. The estimations of the coefficients, the percentage of explained variance and the plots of residuals versus predicted values obtained under each model were compared. Results: With regard to the results of the ESEMeD study, the predicted values obtained with the OLS model and those obtained with the tobit models were very similar. The regression coefficients of the linear model were consistently smaller than those from the tobit model. In the simulation study, we observed that when the error variance was small (s= 1), the tobit model presented unbiased estimations of the coefficients and accurate predicted values, specially when the percentage of individuals wiht the highest possible score was small. However, when the errror variance was greater (s= 10 or s= 20), the percentage of explained variance for the tobit model and the predicted values were more similar to those obtained with an OLS model. Conclusions: The proportion of variability accounted for the models and the percentage of individuals with the highest possible score have an important effect in the performance of the tobit model in comparison with the linear model...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} at what disease {{duration and}} to what extent a ceiling effect, due to reaching maximum scores for erosions (E) and/or joint space narrowing (JSN) in separate joints, started to influence the assessment of radiographic progression according to the modified method of Sharp, in patients with recent onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. Prospective followup study of 87 patients with classical or definite RA, joint symptoms < 1 year at study entry, Radiographs of hands and feet were made at study entry (Time 0), after 3 (T 3), and after 6 years (T 6) of followup. Assessment of radiographic progression according to the Van der Heijde modification of Sharp's method. The scores for E and JSN were analyzed separately in the individual groups of joints. Percentages of E joints, of joints with JSN, and of joints with maximum scores were assessed at TO. T 3, and Tb. The relative risks for the development of radiographic damage and of maximum scores were assessed for the individual joints. An approximation of the magnitude of the ceiling effect was calculated. Results, After a disease duration of 6 years, a significant influence of a ceiling effect on the mean radiographic progression was found. Tn some <b>individual</b> patients the <b>ceiling</b> effect appeared to occur earlier. After 6 years, the maximum scores were distributed over 50 % of the patients, and 20 % of the patients had maximum scores in more than 10 joints without preference for specific localization. Conclusion. The ceiling effect appeared to be clinically relevant and should be taken into account when interpreting the effects of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs on radiographic progression in RA during {{the first years of the}} disease. Furthermore, it must be accounted for when describing the relationship between radiographic progression and process variables...|$|R
40|$|Background: South Africa is {{planning}} to introduce a carbon tax as a Pigouvian measure for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, one of the tax bases designed as a fuel input tax. In this form, {{it is supposed to}} incentivise users to reduce and/or substitute fossil fuels, leading to a reduction of CO 2 emissions. Aim: This article examines how such a carbon tax regime may affect the individual willingness to invest in greenhouse gas mitigation technologies. Setting: Mathematical derivation, using methods of linear programming, duality theory and sensitivity analysis. Methods: By employing a two-step evaluation approach, it allows to identify the factors determining the maximum price an individual investor would pay for such an investment, given the conditions of imperfect markets. Results: This price ceiling depends on the (corrected) net present values of the payments and on the interdependencies arising from changes in the optimal investment and production programmes. Although the well-established results of environmental economics usually can be confirmed for a single investment, increasing carbon taxes may entail sometimes contradictory and unexpected consequences for individual investments in greenhouse gas mitigation technologies and the resulting emissions. Under certain circumstances, they may discourage such investments and, when still undertaken, even lead to higher emissions. However, these results can be interpreted in an economically comprehensible manner. Conclusion: Under the usually given conditions of imperfect markets, the impact of a carbon tax regime on individual investment decisions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is not as straight forward as under the usually assumed, but unrealistically simplifying perfect market conditions. To avoid undesired and discouraging effects, policy makers cannot make solitary decisions, but have to take interdependencies on the addressee´s side into account. The <b>individual</b> investor´s price <b>ceiling</b> for such an investment in imperfect markets can be interpreted as a sum of (partially corrected) net present values, which themselves are a generalisation of the net present values known from perfect market...|$|R
