He was invited by the president of the students' debating society, who said [...] "We believe that the only way to get the truth of what the BNP are saying and to combat them is to do it in public in a debate." [...] The move was attacked by anti-racist groups, some of whom refused to participate in the discussion. [...] Griffin said [...] "I am coming up because I was invited by the students at the university because they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> on an intelligent subject on which I have something to say. The people against it are the usual bunch of people who cannot win the argument and refuse to stand on a platform." [...] The society withdrew the invitation before the event was to take place.|$|E
500|$|The {{outcome of}} the trial was that Holmes was fined £30, Clarke £20, and Crandall £5. [...] Holmes {{had been given the}} {{heaviest}} fine because of his excommunication in Seekonk and for administering the baptisms in Lynn. [...] Clarke protested their heavy fines, and Governor Endicott replied that Clarke [...] "was worthy to be hanged." [...] In court, Endicott told Clarke that his beliefs would not stand up to those of the Puritan ministers. Clarke responded to this by writing a letter to the court from prison the following day, accepting the implied challenge to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> with the Puritan ministers on religious beliefs and practices. [...] The challenge was initially accepted, but Clarke's fine was paid by some friends without his knowledge and he was released from jail. [...] He left the area, and was then accused by the Puritan elders of defaulting on the challenge. [...] He made two more attempts to debate the Puritan clergy, but the case was dropped by the court and the debate never took place. Clarke had drafted four points of discussion which detailed his beliefs and position.|$|E
