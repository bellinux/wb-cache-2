40|$|The {{calculation}} of the two-loop corrections to the three-jet production rate and to event shapes in electron–positron annihilation requires the computation {{of a number of}} two-loop four-point master integrals with one off-shell and three on-shell legs. Up to now, only those master integrals corresponding to planar topologies were known. In this paper, we compute the <b>yet</b> <b>outstanding</b> non-planar master integrals by solving differential equations in the external invariants which are fulfilled by these master integrals. We obtain the master integrals as expansions in ǫ = (4 − d) / 2, where d is the spacetime dimension.

Additionally, the Jordanian advertising had some catching up to {{do with the rest of}} the region in terms of average expenditure per capita. As the sector matures, it is only normal for growth figures to gradually decrease. Since 2000 total ad spend increased from $77m to $280m in 2007, an increase of 260%. The Jordanian telecoms sector was the biggest ad spender in 2007, accounting for around 20% of the market, followed by banking and finance sector (12%), services industry (11%), real estate (8%) and the automotive sector (5%). In the next year, particularly if there is a downturn, it would become increasingly important for the sector to develop good vocational training and to begin to take advantage of new media markets.|$|R

The long-term consequences have been likened to the long-term consequences of other causes of brain injury; which impact on quality of life for the individual and their family several years after the event.

Brain injury rehabilitation guidelines exclusive to the cardiac arrest population <b>are</b> as <b>yet</b> <b>outstanding,</b> and it <b>is</b> unknown whether existing guidelines for adults with acquired brain injury of any cause, are being routinely applied. Purpose: This survey aimed to explore the current provision of acute NHS rehabilitation for adults with brain injury after cardiac arrest. The main objective was to investigate the extent to which current services met key recommendations from published literature and clinical guidelines, for brain injury rehabilitation. A secondary objective was to determine if there was a difference in adherence to these recommendations between hospital trusts with and without ´heart attack centres´; as increasing numbers of people are being treated in such centres after cardiac arrest. Methods/Analysis: A cross-sectional survey design was chosen, to provide quantitative data. A postal questionnaire was chosen as it would have the advantage of a known denominator population. A questionnaire was sent to each of the 144 acute NHS hospital Trusts in England. One physiotherapist from each trust was invited to respond. Individual guidelines were considered met if they were reported as being met ´always´ or ´almost always´ by respondents.

40|$|Hepatitis E virus (HEV) {{infection}} is gaining global attention, {{not only because}} of the increasing burden of the disease in low endemicity countries, in terms of morbidity and mortality rates, but also due to recent advances in the molecular virology and epidemiology of this emerging pathogen. HEV infection spread can be described as the evolution of a zoonosis towards an established human infection. As known from other viruses, such as the human immunodeficiency virus or the influenza viruses, crossing the species barriers from animals to humans is a recurrent phenomenon. Albeit slow at the beginning, once the virus has adapted to humans, the person-to-person spread can proceed very quickly. Although an optimal cell culture system for HEV <b>is</b> not <b>yet</b> available, <b>outstanding</b> progress has been made with the in vitro expression of HEV-like particles.

Although nonlinear optics effects at the single-emitter level have been demonstrated in a number of systems 4 – 13, none of these experiments showed single-photon switching on ultrafast timescales. Here, we perform pulsed two-colour spectroscopy and demonstrate that, in a strongly coupled quantum dot–cavity system, the presence of a single photon on one of the fundamental polariton transitions can turn on light scattering on a transition from the first to the second Jaynes–Cummings manifold. The overall switching time of this single-photon all-optical switch 14 is ∼ 50 ps. In addition, we use the single-photon nonlinearity to implemen...|$|R

Both choices run counter to expectations framed by scholars active in the domain of rich cognitive modelling that see agent reasoning as socially inherently contextualized. The Manchester school of social simulation proposed a particular kind of a socially contextualized reasoning mechanism, so called endorsements, to implement the cognitive processes underlying agent action selection that eventually causes agent interaction. Its usefulness lies in its lightweight architecture and in taking into account folk psychological conceptions of how reasoning works.
