40|$|Theorem 1 of <b>Euler</b> <b>s</b> {{paper of}} 1737 'Variae Observationes Circa Series Infinitas', states the {{astonishing}} result that {{the series of}} all unit fractions whose denominators are perfect powers of integers minus unity has sum one. Euler attributes the Theorem to Goldbach. The proof {{is one of those}} examples of misuse of divergent series to obtain correct results so frequent during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. We examine this proof closely and, with the help of some insight provided by a modern (and completely dierent) proof of the Goldbach-Euler Theorem, we present a rational reconstruction in terms which could be considered rigorous by modern Weierstrassian standards. At the same time, with a few ideas borrowed from nonstandard analysis we see how the same reconstruction can be also be considered rigorous by modern Robinsonian standards. This last approach, though, is completely in tune with Goldbach and <b>Euler</b> <b>s</b> proof. We hope to convince the reader then how, a few simple ideas from nonstandard analysis, vindicate Euler's work...|$|R

We use this data in two ways. Firstly we {{constrain the}} matter density of the Universe, Omega(m) (assuming General Relativity), and use this to construct a diagnostic to detect the presence of an evolving Newton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>constant.</b> Secondly we directly measure the evolution of Newton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>constant,</b> G(eff), that appears in Modified Gravity theories, without assuming General Relativity to be true. The novelty of these approaches are that, contrary to other methods, they do not require knowledge of the expansion history of the Universe, H (z), making them model independent tests. Our constraints for the second derivative of Newton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>constant</b> at the present day, assuming it is slowly evolving as suggested by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints, using the WiggleZ data is (eff) (t(0)) = - 1. 19 +/- 0. 95. 10 (- 20) h(2) yr(- 2), where h is defined via H- 0 = 100 h kms(- 1) Mpc(- 1), while using both the WiggleZ and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Luminous Red Galaxy (SDSS LRG) data is (eff) (t(0)) = - 3. 6 +/- 6. 8. 10 (- 21) h(2) yr(- 2), both being consistent with General Relativity.

40|$|For any {{physical}} theory, to experimentally check its validity, {{we need to}} formulate an alternative theory and check whether the experimental {{results are consistent with}} the original theory or with an alternative theory. In particular, to check whether energy is preserved, it is necessary to formulate an alternative theory in which energy is not preserved. Formulating such a theory is not an easy task in quantum physics, where the usual Schroedinger equation implicitly assumes the existence of an energy (Hamiltonian) operator whose value is preserved. In this paper, we show {{that the only way to}} get a consistent quantum theory with energy non-conservation is to use Heisenberg representation in which operators representing physical quantities change in time. We prove that in this representation, energy is preserved if and only if Planck 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>constant</b> remains a constant. Thus, an appropriate quantum analogue of a theory with non-preserved energy is a theory in which Planck 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>constant</b> can change [...] i. e., is no longer a constant, but a new field...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the overall mathematical model and results from pseudo linear recursive estimators of attitude and rate for a spinning spacecraft. The measurements considered are vector measurements obtained by sun-sensors, fixed head star trackers, horizon sensors, and three axis magnetometers. Two filters are proposed for estimating the attitude {{as well as}} the angular rate vector. One filter, called the q-Filter, yields the attitude estimate as a quaternion estimate, and the other filter, called the D-Filter, yields the estimated direction cosine matrix. Because the spacecraft is gyro-less, <b>Euler</b> <b>s</b> equation of angular motion of rigid bodies is used to enable the estimation of the angular velocity. A simpler Markov model is suggested as a replacement for Euler's equation in the case where the vector measurements are obtained at high rates relative to the spacecraft angular rate.
