25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{negative}} externalities, the introduction of taxes into a market reduces economic efficiency by causing deadweight loss. In a competitive market {{the price of a}} particular economic good adjusts to ensure that all trades which benefit both the buyer and the seller of a good occur. The introduction of a tax causes the price received by the seller to be less than the cost to the buyer by the amount of the tax. This causes fewer transactions to occur, which reduces economic welfare; the individuals or businesses involved are less well off than before the tax. The tax burden and the amount of deadweight cost is dependent on the <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and demand for the good taxed.|$|E
25|$|Various {{efforts have}} been made to {{quantify}} the relationship between tax revenue and tax rates (for example, in the United States by the Congressional Budget Office). While the interaction between tax rates and tax revenue is generally accepted, the precise nature of this interaction is debated. In practice, the shape of a hypothetical Laffer curve for a given economy can only be estimated. The relationship between tax rate and tax revenue is likely to vary from one economy to another and depends on the <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> for labor, as well as various other factors. Even in the same economy, the characteristics of the curve could vary over time. Complexities such as progressive taxes and possible differences in the incentive to work for different income groups complicate the task of estimation. The structure of the curve may also be changed by policy decisions. For example, if tax loopholes and tax shelters are made more readily available by legislation, the point at which revenue begins to decrease with increased taxation is likely to become lower.|$|E
25|$|Most governments take revenue which {{exceeds that}} {{which can be}} {{provided}} by non-distortionary taxes or through taxes which give a double dividend. Optimal taxation theory is the branch of economics that considers how taxes can be structured to give the least deadweight costs, or to give the best outcomes {{in terms of social}} welfare. The Ramsey problem deals with minimizing deadweight costs. Because deadweight costs are related to the <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and demand for a good, it follows that putting the highest tax rates on the goods for which there is most inelastic supply and demand will result in the least overall deadweight costs. Some economists sought to integrate optimal tax theory with the social welfare function, which is the economic expression of the idea that equality is valuable {{to a greater or lesser}} extent. If individuals experience diminishing returns from income, then the optimum distribution of income for society involves a progressive income tax. Mirrlees optimal income tax is a detailed theoretical model of the optimum progressive income tax along these lines. Over the last years the validity of the theory of optimal taxation was discussed by many political economists.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{challenges}} the growing {{consensus in the}} literature (Stone, 2005; Dodds, 2007) that medieval English peasants and manorial managers were price responsive in their production decisions. Using prices of and acreages planted with wheat, barley, and oats on 49 manors held by the bishop of Winchester from 1349 - 70, we estimate price <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> for each grain in aggregate and on each particular manor. Aggregate price <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> for wheat and oats {{were not significantly different}} than zero, and barley aggregate <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> were significant but very low. These elasticities are low compared with price <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> estimated for developing and developed countries in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Attempting to explain the variation in the estimated price elasticities for individual manors, market concentration had a significant, positive effect on price <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> wheat and oat supply. In the end, the low levels of price responsiveness in the post-Black Death period suggest that commercialisation was not as dominant in the medieval English economy as has been argued.

500|$|PEDs, in {{combination}} with price <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> (PES), {{can be used to}} assess where the incidence (or [...] "burden") of a per-unit tax is falling or to predict where it will fall if the tax is imposed. For example, when demand is perfectly inelastic, by definition consumers have no alternative to purchasing the good or service if the price increases, so the quantity demanded would remain constant. [...] Hence, suppliers can increase the price by the full amount of the tax, and the consumer would end up paying the entirety. In the opposite case, when demand is perfectly elastic, by definition consumers have an infinite ability to switch to alternatives if the price increases, so they would stop buying the good or service in question completely—quantity demanded would fall to zero. [...] As a result, firms cannot pass on any part of the tax by raising prices, so they would be forced to pay all of it themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Depending on how {{quantities}} supplied {{and demanded}} vary with price (the [...] "elasticities" [...] {{of supply and}} demand), a tax can be absorbed by the seller (in the form of lower pre-tax prices), or by the buyer (in {{the form of higher}} post-tax prices). If the <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> is low, more of the tax will be paid by the supplier. If the elasticity of demand is low, more will be paid by the customer; and, contrariwise for the cases where those elasticities are high. If the seller is a competitive firm, the tax burden is distributed over the factors of production depending on the elasticities thereof; this includes workers (in the form of lower wages), capital investors (in the form of loss to shareholders), landowners (in the form of lower rents), entrepreneurs (in the form of lower wages of superintendence) and customers (in the form of higher prices).|$|E

The canonical example, and earliest applications, of instrumental variables involved attempts to estimate demand and supply curves. 1 Economists such as P. G.

If the demand and supply curves shift over time, the observed data on quantities and prices reflect a set of equilibrium points on both curves. Consequently, an ordinary least squares regression of quantities on prices fails to identify—that is, trace out—either the supply or demand relationship. P. G.
