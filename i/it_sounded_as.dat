5|$|The name Eboracum {{became the}} Anglian Eoforwic in the 7thcentury: a {{compound}} of Eofor-, from the old name, and -wic a village probably by conflation of the element Ebor- with a Germanic root *eburaz (boar); by the 7thcentury the Old English for 'boar' had become eofor. Alternatively, the word eofor already existed as an Old English word for wild swine, which is a cognate of the current Low Saxon word eaver and Dutch ever. The Anglo-Saxon newcomers probably interpreted the ebor part as eofor, and -rac as ric (meaning rich), while -um was (and is) a common abbreviation of the Saxon -heem, meaning home. To them, <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> a 'home rich in boar'. As is common in Saxon place names, the -um part gradually faded; eoforic. When the Danish army conquered the city in 866, its name became Jórvík.|$|E
25|$|Ström {{headed off}} towards Åby to inform {{them of the}} {{accident}} and met Mr. Andersson, a track walker. From a nearby house, Andersson called Åby and notified them of the accident. Track walker Eriksson arrived from his house east of the accident site. His wife had lowered the boom barrier at the railway crossing and was standing {{and waiting for the}} train when she thought <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if the train had stopped, so Eriksson quickly went {{to the site of the}} derailment. Once he saw that the telegraph poles were aslant, he knew that something serious had occurred. Upon seeing that the train had derailed, he hurried to Getå Halt to notify Krokek Station what had occurred.|$|E
25|$|Many {{accounts}} {{state that}} both men fired in near perfect unison. Some stated <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if one shot had been fired. “One witness said {{it looked as}} if the guns were spitting fire at the same time.” Then, a number of shots followed, ranging between five and nine according to different testimonies. As reports tell of a total of five entry wounds in the two men, the minimum number of shots fired had to be five. The exchange occurred rapidly. Reid received a bullet to one leg. Reid fired two more rounds, one grazing Smith’s left arm and the other striking his left thigh above the knee and exiting the other side. Chambering his Winchester, Smith sent a bullet into Reid’s lower abdomen and groin. Reid fell face down upon the planking, severely wounded. It is not known if Smith remained standing or also had fallen.|$|E

Lipshutz wrote that Gaga sounded [...] "loose and light-hearted, letting her {{audience}} twirl around on the dance floor".

500|$|Nelson and {{the band}} {{encountered}} problems in producing {{some aspects of the}} song. According to Champion, [...] "...it was really difficult to record, because it worked at about five or six different tempos. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if it was dragging..." [...] The band was trying to get the right tempo, according to Nelson, [...] "because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same groove". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson {{and the band}} were happy at the output. The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle.|$|E
500|$|... "Rockstar 101" [...] is a grunge-crunk and hip hop song which {{lasts for}} three minutes and fifty-eight seconds. It {{features}} an [...] "aggressive" [...] guitar solo from Slash, according to Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly. Rihanna uses her lower register and [...] "heavy" [...] modulation to perform {{the most of the}} song, and she [...] "growls" [...] the lyric [...] "The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar". Rihanna [...] "struts her stuff" [...] as she insists that she is a [...] "big shit talker" [...] as she proclaims that [...] "I'll never play a victim/ I'd rather be a stalker". Sean Fennessey for Spin thought that when Rihanna sings the line [...] "Got my middle finger up, I don't give a fuck", <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> though she had never sworn before due to how she preciously mewls the word 'fuck'.|$|E

500|$|... "So Appalled" [...] {{received}} mostly favorable {{reviews from}} contemporary critics. [...] David Browne of Time {{wrote that he}} felt that the track was [...] "built on rumbling tanks of pianos and strings" [...] and that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if West was [...] "marching into the apocalypse." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters compared the production to West's album Late Registration which found West [...] "inviting his friend Jon Brion to impart slices of film scoring to the odds and ends of his tracks". He commented that much like every song on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, the song [...] "contains an underscore as ambitious as the beats upfront", concluding that tracks [...] "Hell of a Life" [...] and [...] "So Appalled" [...] alone [...] "carry enough auditory sugar to make listening to this album on any regular sort of listening device almost a fool's errand." ...|$|E
500|$|While waiting outside, {{the police}} {{questioned}} Bamber, who they said seemed calm. According to the Court of Appeal, {{he told them}} about the phone call from his father, and that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> though someone had cut off the call. He said he did not get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was {{the sort of person who}} might want to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site [...] "would be able to stand him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E
500|$|The two {{original}} songs sung by New Directions {{were rated}} from excellent to abysmal. Benigno gave each song a [...] "B+"; {{he called the}} duet, [...] "Pretending", [...] "lovely". The nicest thing Kubicek wrote {{of it was that}} <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if the lyrics had been [...] "written by a lovesick teenage boy", and he called [...] "Light Up the World" [...] a [...] "trainwreck". Berk was even harsher: [...] "When the show has carte blanche access to every amazing song in the history of popular music, there's something terribly humiliating about watching the kids sing this shit tune as their finale, and do so with such desperate conviction." [...] Gonzalez gave [...] "Light Up the World" [...] a [...] "B+", but said it sounded a [...] "bit too much" [...] like [...] "Loser Like Me", and while Benigno thought it had a better melody than [...] "Loser" [...] and also made [...] "much better use of the Gleeks as a whole", he criticized the chorus for its similarity to [...] "Let It Rock" [...] by Kevin Rudolf. Semigran said it was an [...] "uplifting, if not rather lackluster pop song", yet Hankinson called it his favorite number in the episode.|$|E

[...] Then, due to poor adherence to proper periscope usage protocol {{on the part of}} the German crew, the officer of the watch on Venturers periscope noticed another periscope poking up above the surface of the water. [...] Combined with the hydrophone reports of the strange noise, which he determined to be coming from a submerged vessel, Launders surmised that they had found U-864.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the crew}} was alarmed by the thunder-like sound of the waves {{slamming}} against her flat bottom. Reed and Vogak wrote that at times <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if the ship had hit a hard rock. Around 10 a.m. {{of the next day}} the hull cracked, the space between inner and outer bottoms was flooded, and Vogak rushed his ship to a safe anchorage in Ferrol. The divers discovered a five-meter-long dent and numerous cracks in the fore segment of the hull which were ultimately blamed on waves. Popov concurred and admitted his failure [...] "to foresee the effects of shallow draft". He wrote that the damage had dual mechanism: first, when the flat pontoon pitched above the waves, gravity subjected it to an enormous stress, bending the whole structure down. Next, as it plummeted down, the flat bottom hit water head-on, rupturing the rivets and tearing off the crossbeams. Reed noted that the radial framing pattern chosen by the designers resulted in a strong center section and inadequately weak extremities, and that any experienced shipbuilder should have discovered this weakness in advance.|$|E
