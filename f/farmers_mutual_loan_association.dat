40|$|This study {{examines}} the relative efficiency of 210 <b>mutual</b> savings and <b>loan</b> <b>associations</b> (S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s) and 165 stock S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s located {{in five states}} during the 1974 - 83 time period. Since all mutual and most stock S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s lack publicly traded stock, data for market return and market risk estimates are unavailable. Hence, this study employs accounting based measures of risk and return. Annual residual returns are calculated for both stock and mutual S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s. The residual return {{is the difference between}} expected accounting returns adjusted for systematic or total risk and actual accounting returns. Mean difference t-tests are employed to test the research hypothesis of equal efficiency as measured by the average residuals between stock and mutual S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s. The results indicate no significant difference in average residuals between stock and mutual S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s. The null hypothesis of equal efficiency cannot be rejected. Hence, based upon accounting measures of risk and return both stock and mutual institutions earn returns consistent with their levels of risk. ...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Farmers</b> <b>Mutual</b> Reinsurance Company Building is a {{historic}} structure located in Grinnell, Iowa, United States. [...] "The Iowa <b>Farmers</b> <b>Mutual</b> Reinsurance Association was the first statewide organization {{of its kind in}} the United States." [...] When it moved to Grinnell from Jefferson, Iowa in 1934 its name was changed to <b>Farmers</b> <b>Mutual</b> Reinsurance Company. It was still a relatively small operation at the time that required only simple rented upstairs quarters. The present building was first occupied in 1951, but only the first two floors were built. The top two floors were completed in 1957, and gave the building its present form. The company rented out the first floor to other commercial businesses. <b>Farmers</b> <b>Mutual</b> Reinsurance Company moved out of building in 1962 to a larger complex south of Grinnell, and at that time became known as the Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Company. This building was sold to the General Telephone Company, which occupied the whole building until 1968. The Trustees of Iowa (Grinnell) College, GTE Data of Iowa, and DeLong's Sportswear have all subsequently owned the building.|$|R
40|$|The mutual {{structure}} of various financial institutions has changed internationally, {{especially during the}} late 1980 s and early 1990 s. Various explanations have been offered. Some commentators argue the mutual organisational form has become redundant, others consider structural changes in the financial services industry as {{the main reason for}} organisational changes. In the United Kingdom the stronger emphasis on profitability {{had a profound impact on}} the decision to demutualise many building societies. In the USA the failure of <b>mutual</b> savings and <b>loan</b> <b>associations</b> resulted in demutualisation as a rescue strategy. This paper will explore the specific circumstances in South Africa of the changes in the mutual organisational form of the building societies and insurance companies. The mutual form of organisation has a long history in South Africa. This paper will explore the reasons for the early choice of mutuality and the recent forces leading to the demutualisation of companies in order to list as public entities on stock exchanges, both in South Africa as well as abroad. South Africa experienced varying degrees of international isolation and sanctions, but in the financial services industry a strong international connection was sustained. The South African experience will be considered against the international changes in the financial services industry as well as the regulatory changes in South Africa. The paper will explain the peculiar South African conditions as the context for the organisational changes in South African mutual...|$|R
