5|$|Christopher Marquette plays Miles Caraday, a young jazz piano prodigy with Tourette Syndrome. Marquette {{learned how}} to play the piano from Wolff. He also studied ticcing from Wolff and watched videotapes, {{including}} the documentary Twitch and Shout, to perfect <b>his</b> <b>technique.</b> In preparation for the role, Marquette practiced ticcing in public.|$|E
5|$|In 1738 in Great Britain, William Champion {{patented}} {{a process}} to extract zinc from calamine in a vertical retort style smelter. <b>His</b> <b>technique</b> resembled that used at Zawar zinc mines in Rajasthan, but no evidence suggests he visited the Orient. Champion's process was used through 1851.|$|E
5|$|While a teenager, Kane {{initially}} {{struggled in}} Tottenham's academy, as partially {{due to his}} date of birth in July, he was not as physically developed as other players, nor was he as quick. However, he gained the respect of coaches with <b>his</b> <b>technique</b> and desire for self-improvement.|$|E

5|$|At Chelsea, Fàbregas {{played a}} similar playmaking role in midfield, using <b>his</b> <b>technique,</b> ball control, vision, and passing ability to dictate the tempo of his team's play, {{while he was}} {{supported}} by defensive midfielders, {{in order to give}} him more space and time on the ball. In this deeper creative role, he excelled in Chelsea's new style of play under Mourinho, where he proved to be an effective assist-provider.|$|E
5|$|Berger told Simpson that if {{he wanted}} to be a {{successful}} road cyclist, he needed experience in track cycling, particularly in the pursuit discipline. Simpson competed regularly at Fallowfield Stadium in Manchester, where in early 1956 he met amateur world pursuit silver medallist Cyril Cartwright, who helped him develop <b>his</b> <b>technique.</b> At the national championships at Fallowfield the 18-year-old Simpson won a silver medal in the individual pursuit, defeating amateur world champion Norman Sheil before losing to Mike Gambrill.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{continued}} to produce paintings ranging from still lifes to formal portraits, and to attract both admiration for <b>his</b> <b>technique</b> and criticism for supposed obscenity, {{until his death}} in 1849. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, and his works fetched huge sums on resale. Changing tastes from the 1870s onwards meant history paintings in Etty's style fell rapidly out of fashion, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century, the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices.|$|E

5|$|Fender fielded mainly at slip. He possessed quick {{reactions}} and could {{move quickly to}} catch balls hit some distance from him. <b>His</b> <b>technique</b> was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the ball with one leg stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics regarded {{him as one of}} the best slip fielders in England.|$|E
5|$|On {{some of the}} figures, however, {{there still}} remains clear {{evidence}} of painting in carbon black. The apparent explanation {{for this is that}} over the long period that Michelangelo was at work, he probably, for a variety of reasons, varied <b>his</b> <b>technique.</b> Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular giornata include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.|$|E
5|$|Over {{this period}} Vaughan Williams {{composed}} steadily, producing songs, choral music, chamber works and orchestral pieces, gradually finding {{the beginnings of}} his mature style. His compositions included the tone poem In the Fen Country (1904) and the Norfolk Rhapsody No. 1 (1906). He remained unsatisfied with <b>his</b> <b>technique</b> as a composer. After unsuccessfully seeking lessons from Sir Edward Elgar, he contemplated studying with Vincent d'Indy in Paris. Instead, he was introduced by the critic and musicologist M.D.Calvocoressi to Maurice Ravel, a more modernist, less dogmatic musician than d'Indy.|$|E

5|$|SNK Playmore staff created Ash as an evil main character, in {{contrast}} to previous main characters. His moves have been reworked in every game {{in which he has}} appeared, gaining new techniques {{as a result of his}} actions or modified to balance the character roster. Critical response to Ash has been largely negative due to his androgynous appearance and <b>his</b> <b>technique.</b> In interviews and press releases, video game publisher UTV Ignition Entertainment noted that he was unpopular with Western gamers and his design was better suited to Japanese fans.|$|E
5|$|The cycle {{consists}} of sixteen sonatas (thirteen {{of which are}} cast in binary form, the remaining three in ternary form) and four more freely structured interludes. The aim of the pieces is to express the eight permanent emotions of the rasa Indian tradition. In Sonatas and Interludes, Cage elevated <b>his</b> <b>technique</b> of rhythmic proportions {{to a new level}} of complexity. In each sonata a short sequence of natural numbers and fractions defines the structure of the work and that of its parts, informing structures as localized as individual melodic lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} Szigeti's appeal to composers was {{articulated}} by Bloch {{upon completion of}} his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere {{would have to be}} delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and <b>his</b> <b>technique,</b> but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music.|$|E

5|$|The three Miller boys played Australian rules {{football}} {{in winter and}} cricket in summer. Their {{father had been a}} successful local cricketer and taught the boys to play with an orthodox and classical technique, relying on a solid defence and concentration in the mould of Bill Ponsford. At the age of seven, Miller's family moved to Elsternwick, in Melbourne's south east. As a child, Miller was small for his age, which forced him to develop <b>his</b> <b>technique</b> rather than rely on power, something that held him in good stead for the future.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Kerry took an {{extended}} break from competitive swimming. He {{was asked to}} return for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, so he made a comeback, but only did two weeks of solid training and missed selection, failing to win either of the backstroke events. In 1983, he began preparing for the Olympics, but did not start serious work until October. Kerry was confident {{in his ability to}} perform at international standards with sporadic preparation after long sabbaticals. He attributed this to <b>his</b> <b>technique</b> and ability to keep his 190cm, 80kg body in shape while not training.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} Ivy League pitcher focus, Krichell also {{unearthed}} several position players. He signed Charlie Keller, a highly touted prospect {{playing for the}} University of Maryland. To encourage Keller to sign, Krichell met and had dinner with his family. In 1937, Krichell signed shortstop Phil Rizzuto, who had tried out with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, but was dismissed by them {{on the grounds that}} he was too small. Even so, Krichell decided to look at the infielder and was impressed by the way Rizzuto accomplished double plays; <b>his</b> <b>technique</b> reminded Krichell of Leo Durocher, one of his favorite players. He signed Rizzuto for $75 a month and sent him to the Yankees' farm club in Bassett, Virginia.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 19, McCabe {{was called}} up for the 1930 tour of England despite being yet to score his maiden {{first-class}} century as the selectors chose the youngest ever team to leave Australia. McCabe made his first century in a warm-up match but struggled in his month in England, scoring only 51 runs. His performance began to improve after adjusting <b>his</b> <b>technique</b> and he played in all five Tests, although he continued to have problems converting starts into large scores, failing to make a century during the tour. McCabe managed to maintain his position {{over the next two}} home seasons, playing in all ten Tests, but failed to make a century, and after 15 Tests, his average was below 35 although he had become increasingly successful at first-class level.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, other doctors were also experimenting with gland transplantation, {{including}} Serge Voronoff, {{who had become}} known for grafting monkey testicles into men. In 1920, Voronoff demonstrated <b>his</b> <b>technique</b> before several other doctors {{at a hospital in}} Chicago, at which Brinkley showed up uninvited. Though Brinkley was barred at the door, his appearance elevated his profile in the press, which eventually resulted in his own demonstration at a hospital in Chicago. Brinkley transplanted goat testicles into 34 patients, including a judge, an alderman, a society matron and the chancellor of the now-defunct Chicago Law School (not {{to be confused with the}} University of Chicago Law School), all while the press looked on. His public profile grew, and his gland business in Milford continued at a brisk pace.|$|E
5|$|During {{his student}} days, Gaudí {{attended}} craft workshops, {{such as those}} taught by Eudald Puntí, Llorenç Matamala and Joan Oñós, where he learned the basic aspects of techniques relating to architecture, including sculpture, carpentry, wrought ironwork, stained glass, ceramics, plaster modelling, etc. He also absorbed new technological developments, integrating into <b>his</b> <b>technique</b> the use of iron and reinforced concrete in construction. Gaudí took a broad view of architecture as a multifunctional design, in which every single detail in an arrangement has to be harmoniously made and well-proportioned. This knowledge allowed him to design architectural projects, including {{all the elements of}} his works, from furnishings to illumination to wrought ironwork.|$|E
