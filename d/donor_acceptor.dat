Our model includes (i) two discrete energy levels associated with <b>donor</b> and <b>acceptor,</b> interacting through a dipole-type matrix element and (ii) two continuum manifolds of electron energy levels ("sinks"), which interact {{directly with the}} <b>donor</b> and <b>acceptor.</b> Namely, two discrete energy levels of the <b>donor</b> and <b>acceptor</b> are embedded in their independent sinks through the corresponding interaction matrix elements. We also introduce classical (external) noise which acts simultaneously on the <b>donor</b> and <b>acceptor</b> (collective interaction). We derive a closed system of integro-differential equations which describes the non-Markovian quantum dynamics of the ET. A region of parameters is found in which the ET dynamics can be simplified, and described by coupled ordinary differential equations. Using these simplified equations, both sharp and flat redox potentials are analyzed. We analytically and numerically obtain the characteristic parameters that optimize the ET rates and efficiency in this system. Comment: 15 pages, 15 figura...|$|R

5000|$|Double bonded {{compounds}}, alkene homologs, R2E=ER2 are {{now known}} {{for all of}} the heavier group 14 elements. Unlike the alkenes these compounds are not planar but adopt twisted and/or trans bent structures. These effects become more pronounced for the heavier elements. The distannene (Me3Si)2CHSn=SnCH(SiMe3)2 has a tin-tin bond length just a little shorter than a single bond, a trans bent structure with pyramidal coordination at each tin atom, and readily dissociates in solution to form (Me3Si)2CHSn: (stannanediyl, a carbene analog). The bonding comprises two weak <b>donor</b> <b>acceptor</b> bonds, the lone pair on each tin atom overlapping with the empty p orbital on the other. [...] In contrast, in disilenes each silicon atom has planar coordination but the substituents are twisted so that the molecule as a whole is not planar. In diplumbenes the Pb=Pb bond length can be longer than that of many corresponding single bonds Plumbenes and stannenes generally dissociate in solution into monomers with bond enthalpies that are just a fraction of the corresponding single bonds. Some double bonds plumbenes and stannenes are similar in strength to hydrogen bonds. The Carter-Goddard-Malrieu-Trinquier model can be used to predict the nature of the bonding.|$|E

50|$|One {{method of}} {{measuring}} FRET efficiency is {{to measure the}} variation in acceptor emission intensity. When the <b>donor</b> and <b>acceptor</b> are in proximity (1-10 nm) due to {{the interaction of the}} two molecules, the acceptor emission will increase because of the intermolecular FRET from the <b>donor</b> to the <b>acceptor.</b> For monitoring protein conformational changes, the target protein is labeled with a <b>donor</b> and an <b>acceptor</b> at two loci. When a twist or bend of the protein brings the change in the distance or relative orientation of the <b>donor</b> and <b>acceptor,</b> FRET change is observed. If a molecular interaction or a protein conformational change is dependent on ligand binding, this FRET technique is applicable to fluorescent indicators for the ligand detection.|$|R

40|$|International audienceCharge-transfer {{complexes}} involving tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) derivatives are engineered in a 2 D arrangement onto {{a carbon}} surface through {{the exposure of}} immobilized TTF units to TCNQ compounds. TTF molecules were immobilized as robust monolayers on carbon surfaces using the electrografting method followed by a click chemistry coupling. When the TTF monolayer is exposed to TCNQ TCNQF(2) (2, 5 -difluoroTCNQ), and TCNQF 4 (2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrafluoro-TCNQ), strong <b>donor</b> <b>acceptor</b> complexes are formed onto the surface. A considerable decrease of the electrochemical response accompanies {{the formation of the}} charge-transfer complex. This observation is rationalized by the analysis of original crystal samples using an ultramicroelectrode cavity, confirming that charge transfer complexes are electrochemically silent. A fine control of the degree of charge transfer with the judicious choice of different acceptors is evidenced through electrochemical and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. Thus, <b>donor</b> <b>acceptor</b> complexes of different natures are formed. A fully ionic charge-transfer complex is formed upon exposure of the TTF monolayer to the more oxidizing TCNQF(4), while a neutral complex is obtained after exposure to the less oxidizing TCNQ, Exposition of the TTF monolayers to the intermediate TCNQF(2) yields a mixture of neutral-ionic systems. These <b>donor</b> <b>acceptor</b> interactions that fully mimic those described in the solid state are rarely described in such a 2 D arrangement, with systems being directly wired to an electrode...|$|E
40|$|We have {{designed}} and prepared three pseudopeptide foldamers, called dyads 1, 2 and 3, {{equipped with a}} <b>donor</b> and an <b>acceptor</b> unit to promote intramolecular electron transfer after light excitation. All the three dyads contain the same <b>donor</b> and <b>acceptor,</b> which are a derivative of 1, 5 -dihydroxynaphthalene and a derivative of pyromellitic diimide, respectively. The <b>donor</b> and <b>acceptor</b> units are separated by hybrid foldamers of different length in order to vary both their distance and relative orientation. Specifically, one, two or three L-Ala-D-Oxd (Ala ¼ alanine, Oxd ¼ 4 -carboxy- 5 -methyl-oxazolidin- 2 -one) units are contained in dyads 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Dyad 1 folds in a bent conformation in which the <b>donor</b> and <b>acceptor</b> units lie one close to the other, while dyads 2 and 3 preferentially assume an extended conformation. In all the three dyads both the <b>donor</b> and <b>acceptor</b> emissions are efficiently quenched via intramolecular electron transfer, as suggested by photophysical and electrochemical investigations. Because of its bent conformation dyad 1 exhibits a charge-transfer (CT) band at 410 nm in CH 2 Cl 2 solution and a photoinduced electron transfer that occurs more efficiently than in dyads 2 and 3. Upon dissolving dyad 1 in DMSO, a competitive solvent for hydrogen bonds that establish in the pseudopeptide linker, the CT band disappears and the efficiency of electron transfer slightly decreases, in agreement with an unfolded conformation in which <b>donor</b> and <b>acceptor</b> units {{are no longer in}} close contact...|$|R
