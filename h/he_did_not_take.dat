5|$|Culbreth {{had never}} umpired prior to {{attending}} umpire school in 1987. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> long {{to reach the}} major leagues, where {{he made his first}} umpiring appearance on August 13, 1993. On that day, Culbreth umpired at second base in a game played at the Kingdome between the Seattle Mariners and the California Angels.|$|E
5|$|Following John V's death, Manuel II Palaeologus {{was able}} to secure his throne and {{establish}} {{good relations with the}} Sultan, becoming his vassal. In return for Ottoman acceptance of his reign Manuel II was forced to dismantle the fortifications at the Golden Gate, something that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> lightly to.|$|E
5|$|Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts' Headmaster {{and one of}} {{the most}} famous and {{powerful}} wizards of all time.

5|$|Despite {{his success}} on the field, Macartney still had a regular job outside of cricket, as with most cricketers of the era. In 1914, he left his job on the Sydney wharves and joined the staff of New South Wales Railways & Tramways in the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office at Redfern. The {{following}} season, he scored 191 runs at 38.20 including a century in three matches. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> a wicket.|$|E
5|$|His first acting {{role was}} as Winnie the Pooh for first grade. At 16, he was cast as Judas for the play Godspell, {{and enjoyed the}} experience, though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> acting seriously. He {{attended}} John Burroughs School, a private school in Ladue, {{where he was a}} member of the football, baseball, and swim teams. During this time, he dated Sarah Clarke, who became an actress. His father died when Hamm was 20.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Polish Eastern Borderlands were annexed into Soviet Ukraine and the family, {{like many}} other Poles, was resettled to Kraków, where Lem, at his father's insistence, took up medical studies at the Jagiellonian University. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> his final {{examinations}} on purpose, {{so as not to}} be obliged to become a military doctor. Earlier, he had started working as an assistant in a hospital and writing stories in his spare time.|$|E

5|$|Seaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 {{until he}} {{suffered}} a stroke in 1998. As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged {{him to become a}} bookkeeper as she felt his literary interests were impractical. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> an interest in science until his junior year when he was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, a chemistry and physics teacher at David Starr Jordan High School in Watts.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji's early {{preoccupation with}} the occult subsided, and he became more {{interested}} in other religions, {{although it is not}} known whether he practised any. He was enthusiastic about Parsi culture, but became disillusioned with Parsis after visiting India in 1932. He embraced only a few of aspects of Zoroastrianism, and in later years he was interested in Roman Catholicism, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> it up. For much of his life he practised yoga, but it is not known what branch of it.|$|E
5|$|Although not all Conservapedia {{contributors}} {{subscribe to}} a young-earth creationist point of view—former administrator Terry Koeckritz stated to the Los Angeles Times that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> the Genesis creation account literally—sources have attributed the poor science coverage to an overall editorial support of the young-earth creationist perspective and an over-reliance on Christian creationist home-schooling textbooks. In an analysis in early 2007, science writer Carl Zimmer found evidence {{that much of what}} appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information about science and scientific theory could be traced back to an over-reliance on citations from the works of home-schooling textbook author Jay L. Wile.|$|E

5000|$|Jamie McShane as Lt. Moyers, {{the leader}} of the National Guard {{contingent}} in charge of protecting Madison's neighborhood. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> the complaints of the citizens too seriously and is a loose cannon.|$|R

5|$|At {{a meeting}} of local Democrats in Bardstown, Kentucky, in 1859, Brown was {{nominated}} to oppose Joshua Jewett for Jewett's seat in the House of Representatives. Despite Brown's protests {{that he was more}} than a year younger than the legal age to serve, he was elected over Jewett by about two thousand votes. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> his seat until the second congressional session because of his age. He {{became a member of the}} Douglas National Committee in 1860 and engaged in a series of debates with supporters of John C. Breckinridge for president, including Breckinridge's cousin, William Campbell Preston Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|Brudenell {{was a fine}} rider and, {{inspired}} by the decisive role of cavalry {{at the battle of}} Waterloo, his wish was to purchase a commission in a fashionable regiment and serve as an army officer. His father, however, mindful of preserving the family pedigree from risk of battle, would not allow this. Instead in November 1815 he was sent up to Christ Church, Oxford; as an aristocrat he was automatically granted admission without examination. He left in his third year—aristocrats with no academic bent were released after only two years—but despite showing some aptitude, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> a degree.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, John C. Fremont led {{the first}} {{scientific}} {{expedition to the}} lake, but with winter coming on, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> the time to survey the entire lake. That happened in 1850 {{under the leadership of}} Howard Stansbury (Stansbury discovered and named the Stansbury mountain range and Stansbury island). John Fremont's overly glowing reports of the area were published shortly after his expedition. Stansbury also published a formal report of his survey work which became very popular. His report of the area included a discussion of Mormon religious practices based on Stansbury's interaction with the Mormon community in Great Salt Lake City, which had been established three years earlier in 1847.|$|E

5|$|Little is {{recorded}} of MacGregor's childhood. After his father's death in 1794, {{he and his}} two sisters were raised primarily by his mother {{with the help of}} various relatives. MacGregor's biographer David Sinclair speculates that he would probably have spoken mainly Gaelic during his early childhood, and learned English only after starting school around the age of five-and-a-half. MacGregor would claim in later life to have studied at the University of Edinburgh between 1802 and 1803; records of this do not survive as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> a degree, but Sinclair considers it plausible, citing MacGregor's apparent sophistication and his mother's connections in Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Macartney {{finished}} with 61 in the drawn Fifth Test at The Oval, {{to head the}} run-scoring with 300 runs at 42.85 as Australia took the series 3–0. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> a wicket in the Tests. Macartney then scored 121 against Gloucestershire in an innings victory immediately after the Tests, but did not pass 45 in the remaining four matches of the tour. Macartney topped the batting aggregates and averages with 2,317 runs at 59.41 in the first-class matches. He took only eight wickets at 32.63 for the entire tour.|$|E
5|$|Michael Rosenbaum plays Lex Luthor, a billionaire's son sent to Smallville to run {{the local}} {{fertilizer}} plant. After Clark saves his life, they become fast friends. As the series progresses, Lex's friendship with Clark crumbles until they consider themselves enemies. The role was difficult to cast; Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice and, feeling that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> his first audition seriously enough, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene indicating where to be funny, charismatic or menacing. His second audition went so well that he was hired. Rosenbaum left the show after seven seasons, reprising his role for the series finale.|$|E

5|$|Toshack {{returned}} {{for the final}} county match against Sussex before the First Test. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> a wicket but pinned down the local batsmen as Lindwall blasted them out with match figures of 11/59. Eight of Lindwall's victims had their stumps knocked over. Toshack bowled 15 overs for 23 runs in the first innings as the hosts were skittled for 86. He did not bat as Australia made 5/549 and then returned in the second innings for 17 overs that yielded only three scoring shots {{for a total of}} six runs. He finished the match with a total of 0/29 from 32 overs.|$|E
5|$|Twenty years later, in 1930, Governor Huey Long would {{rail against}} this loss {{when he ran}} for the office of U.S. Senator against {{incumbent}} Joseph E. Ransdell. In a circular distributed by his campaign to the citizens of New Orleans, Long listed the loss of the Mint as the very first of many complaints against Ransdell's lengthy service record in the Senate. Long {{went on to win the}} election, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> office until his term as governor expired in 1932. At some point, however, the original New Orleans machinery was lost, and, at present, has not been located.|$|E
5|$|Although O'Malley was {{loyal to}} his {{employees}}, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> kindly to demands from employees such as manager Charlie Dressen's {{request for a}} three-year contract. When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. Then when he hired Walter Alston as a replacement, {{he made it clear}} to the press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in the national media. There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts in the fall and showed up in the spring to find out his salary. O'Malley also did not support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.|$|E
