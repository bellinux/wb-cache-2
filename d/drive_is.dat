5|$|A park {{entrance}} fee is charged {{at the four}} access points to the drive. Skyline <b>Drive</b> <b>is</b> a two-lane road that has 75 overlooks providing views of the Shenandoah Valley {{to the west and}} the Piedmont to the east. The drive provides access to numerous trails, including the Appalachian Trail, and it is also used for biking and horseback riding. Skyline <b>Drive</b> <b>is</b> the main road through Shenandoah National Park and has access to campgrounds, visitor centers, and resorts such as Skyland Resort and Big Meadows. The scenic <b>drive</b> <b>is</b> particularly popular in the fall for leaf peeping when the leaves are changing colors. Skyline <b>Drive</b> <b>is</b> designated a National Scenic Byway and a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Biking and {{horseback riding}} are other {{recreational}} {{activities that are}} allowed on the road. The <b>drive</b> <b>is</b> popular in the fall months for leaf peeping to view fall foliage. Skyline <b>Drive</b> <b>is</b> closed from dusk to dawn from November to early January to ensure rangers can control illegal hunting. The drive can also close {{for a short time}} following snow or ice storms. Skyline <b>Drive</b> <b>is</b> designated a National Scenic Byway.|$|E
5|$|A {{variable-frequency}} drive (VFD; also termed adjustable-frequency drive, variable speed drive, AC drive, micro drive or inverter <b>drive)</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} adjustable-speed drive used in electro-mechanical drive systems to control AC motor speed and torque by varying motor input frequency and voltage.|$|E
50|$|The EZ 135 <b>drive</b> <b>was</b> {{available}} with several interfaces. The external <b>drive</b> <b>was</b> {{available with}} parallel or SCSI interfaces; the internal <b>drive</b> <b>was</b> available with IDE or SCSI interfaces.|$|R
5000|$|The 7933 and 7935 <b>drives</b> <b>were</b> {{often used}} with the HP 3000 series family of {{minicomputers}} and later in early versions of the HP 9000 series computers. [...] <b>Drives</b> <b>were</b> connected via the HP-IB interface to the host computer and multiple <b>drives</b> could <b>be</b> connected in a daisy-chain. The HP-IB address of the <b>drive</b> <b>was</b> selectable via DIP switches next to the interface.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} speed, reliability, {{durability}} and low media cost, these tapes and tape <b>drives</b> <b>are</b> {{still in high}} demand. A hallmark of the genre is transferability. Tapes recorded with one tape <b>drive</b> <b>are</b> generally readable on another drive, even if the tape <b>drives</b> <b>were</b> built by different manufacturers.|$|R
5|$|Gene <b>drive</b> <b>is</b> a {{technique}} for changing wild populations, for instance to combat insects so they cannot transmit diseases (in particular mosquitoes {{in the cases}} of malaria and zika).|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} <b>drive</b> <b>is</b> improved if the <b>drive</b> <b>is</b> frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E
5|$|The Reagan Library is {{the largest}} of the 13federally {{operated}} presidential libraries. The street address, 40 Presidential <b>Drive,</b> <b>is</b> numbered in honor of Reagan's place as the 40th President.|$|E
50|$|According to such theorists as Clark Hull and Kenneth Spence, <b>drive</b> {{reduction}} <b>is</b> a {{major cause}} of learning and behavior. Primary <b>drives</b> <b>are</b> innate <b>drives</b> (e.g. thirst, hunger, and sex), whereas secondary <b>drives</b> <b>are</b> learned by conditioning (e.g. money). Doris Kraeling and Byron Campbell experimented to determine if “reduction would be more effective as a reinforcer if the initial <b>drive</b> <b>were</b> low than if the initial <b>drive</b> <b>were</b> high.” Their findings are quite surprising: “Changes in stimuli are more discriminable at low levels of stimulus intensity than at higher levels of stimulus intensity”.|$|R
25|$|Usually, such <b>drives</b> will <b>be</b> custom-stamped with a company's logo, {{as a form}} of advertising. The <b>drive</b> may <b>be</b> blank, or {{preloaded}} with graphics, documentation, web links, Flash animation {{or other}} multimedia, and free or demonstration software. Some preloaded <b>drives</b> <b>are</b> read-only, while others are configured with both read-only and user-writable segments. Such dual-partition <b>drives</b> <b>are</b> more expensive.|$|R

5|$|McFetridge <b>Drive</b> <b>is</b> the {{boundary}} between Grant Park and Burnham Park. Beginning with Northerly Island and the 14th Street Beach, and enclosing Burnham Harbor and its public marina, the park runs in a narrow strip past Soldier Field and McCormick Place, both of which disrupt Burnham's original plan, south to 56th street. The park, from North to South, runs through the communities of Near South, Douglas, Oakland, Kenwood and Hyde Park.|$|E
5|$|Mulholland <b>Drive</b> <b>is</b> a 2001 American neo-noir {{psychological}} thriller {{written and}} directed by Lynch, starring Justin Theroux, Naomi Watts, and Laura Harring. The film tells the story of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms, newly arrived in Los Angeles, California, who meets and befriends an amnesiac hiding in her aunt's apartment. The story includes several other seemingly unrelated vignettes that eventually connect in various ways, as well as some surreal scenes and images that relate to the cryptic narrative.|$|E
5|$|NY28's {{southern}} terminus is with NY32 (Albany Avenue) in {{the city}} of Kingston. The route heads north, then northwest on Colonel Chandler Drive, a four-lane limited-access highway. The roadway is also designated and signed as I-587, which begins at NY32 as well. Although Colonel Chandler <b>Drive</b> <b>is</b> built to Interstate Highway standards, it has no intermediary interchanges. After crossing over the Esopus Creek into Ulster, I-587 terminates at a roundabout that links I-587 and NY28 to the New York State Thruway (I-87) at exit19.|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacturer}} of the Orb <b>Drive</b> <b>was</b> Castlewood Systems. It {{was formed by}} several former employees of SyQuest Technologies. Shortly after the Orb <b>Drive</b> <b>was</b> released, SyQuest brought a lawsuit against Castlewood.|$|R
50|$|The {{technical}} {{importance of}} the locomotive was marginal. At {{the moment of the}} handover of the Ae 4/8, six Be 4/7s with the Westinghouse drive, and the first few Ae 3/6I with the BBC <b>drive,</b> <b>were</b> already in service. Because of its complexity the Tschanz <b>drive</b> <b>was</b> not developed any further. The last remaining parts of this <b>drive</b> <b>were</b> scrapped at the Zürich workshop in 1967.|$|R
40|$|The 2007 {{study used}} a biased {{selection}} process where {{the primary focus}} was the purchase of high-speed SCSI drives and drive packs, in addition 2. 5 inch laptop <b>drives</b> <b>were</b> targeted. Conventional IDE based hard <b>drives</b> <b>were</b> also examined in the study. A total of 84 <b>drives</b> <b>were</b> examined this year, 23 yielded data that represented significant {{and in some cases}} profound exposure if data. Encouragingly more hard disks were erased in this study than in previous studies. However, there is still a significant gap in erasure procedures in organisations, which is particularly concerning given that the <b>drives</b> <b>were</b> from large corporations...|$|R
5|$|NY317 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY5 (Main Street) and South Street (CR122) in the Onondaga County village of Elbridge. The route heads northward {{from the central}} intersection, passing a small commercial lot {{to the west and}} several residential homes to the north and west. Just {{to the west of the}} highway is Valley Drive, formerly NY31C, which parallels NY317 for its entire length. Separating NY317 and Valley <b>Drive</b> <b>is</b> Skaneateles Creek, which runs between the two highways.|$|E
5|$|State Route 11 (SR 11) {{is a state}} {{route in}} San Diego County that is planned to connect SR 905 and SR 125 with the {{proposed}} new U.S.–Mexico border crossing at Otay Mesa East.

5|$|The {{eastern half}} of the route from 34Street to Anthony Henday <b>Drive</b> <b>is</b> {{designated}} as Highway100 by Alberta Transportation, but is not signed as such at any point along the route. The western segment is {{under the jurisdiction of the}} City of Edmonton. Between Anthony Henday Drive and 17Street, Sherwood Park Freeway carries approximately 40,000 vehicles per day, with heavy westbound volume in the morning peak hours and eastbound in the afternoon as commuters travel to and from the primarily residential community of Sherwood Park.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the revised}} book {{versions}} of Triplanetary and the core Lensman novels, the partially inertialess <b>drive</b> <b>was</b> given by Arisia to Nevia, and the fully inertialess <b>drive</b> <b>was</b> initially developed by scientists Rodebush and Cleveland, but the early <b>drive</b> <b>was</b> {{considered to be}} a [...] "man-killer."Progress was made when the Triplanetary scientist Nels Bergenholm, activated by the Arisian Drounli, came up with a [...] "hunch" [...] which solved the phasing problems of the original Rodebush-Cleveland drive. This made the drive safe and commercially practical, and in recognition of his achievement, the <b>drive</b> <b>was</b> thereafter called a Bergenholm.|$|R
50|$|Hindmarsh <b>Drive</b> <b>was</b> {{extended}} from Woden Valley into Weston Creek in late-1968 {{to serve as}} the main arterial road into the new district. Streeton Drive connecting Cotter Road with Hindmarsh <b>Drive</b> <b>was</b> then constructed in early-1970.|$|R
40|$|Pneumatic linear <b>drives</b> <b>are</b> {{widely used}} in manufacturing, mainly for {{handling}} tasks. Due to rising interest in environmental matters and increasing energy costs, energy efficiency {{has become a major}} issue in industrial applications. There is a growing competition between pneumatic and electromechanical <b>drives.</b> Pneumatic <b>drives</b> <b>are</b> said to have a lower efficiency while the initial costs of electromechanical <b>drives</b> <b>are</b> higher. The operating costs of electromechanical as well as pneumatic <b>drives</b> <b>are</b> induced by their exergy efficiency. The efficiency of the drives depends on parameters like cycle time, load applied to the cylinder and its acceleration and velocity. Former research did only provide limited data on the influence of these parameters. The paper provides an overview on the exergy efficiency of pneumatic and electromechanical drives and its dependency on the mentioned parameters. Since electromechanical <b>drives</b> <b>are</b> often used to replace pneumatic <b>drives</b> both technologies <b>are</b> examined in typical applications for pneumatic drives, including horizontal and vertical movement and sustaining a load for different periods in vertical usage...|$|R
5|$|At the {{southeast}} end of Spring Street is Riverside Drive, which {{provides some of}} the most scenic views of the Ohio River and the eastern Louisville shoreline because of the limited alterations compared to other sections of the Ohio River in the Louisville area. Houseboats are docked along the Ohio River {{on the south side of}} Riverside Drive. The north side of Riverside Drive has a variety of architectural styles and is mostly residential. Unlike the other prominent streets, Riverside <b>drive</b> <b>is</b> outside the flood-wall that surrounds most of the city and was built two feet higher than the height the Ohio River flood of 1937.|$|E
5|$|<b>Drive</b> <b>is</b> a 2011 American neo-noir crime film {{directed}} by Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn and written by Hossein Amini, {{based on the}} eponymous 2005 novel by James Sallis.
