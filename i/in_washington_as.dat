5|$|Phát and Thảo were {{stripped}} of their ranks, but nothing was initially done as far as prosecuting or sentencing them for their involvement in the coup. The new junta decided to ignore Khiêm’s actions and he remained <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>as</b> the ambassador, with no further action taken. Phát and Thảo stayed in hiding in Catholic villages. They offered to surrender and support the government if they and their officers were granted amnesty.|$|E
5|$|The United States Navy's {{greatest}} defeat until World War II caused panic <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> <b>As</b> Lincoln's Cabinet met {{to discuss}} the disaster, the frightened Secretary of War Edwin Stanton told the others that the Virginia might attack East coast cities, and even shell the White House before the meeting ended. Welles assured his colleagues that they were safe as the ship could not traverse the Potomac River. He added that the Union also had an ironclad, {{and that it was}} heading to meet the Virginia.|$|E
5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. Wheeler {{became part of the}} DuPont design staff. He worked closely with its engineers, commuting between Chicago and Wilmington, Delaware, where DuPont had its headquarters. He moved his family to Wilmington in March 1943. DuPont's task was not just to build nuclear reactors, but an entire plutonium production complex at the Hanford Site <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> <b>As</b> work progressed, Wheeler relocated his family again in July 1944, this time to Richland, Washington, where he worked in the scientific buildings known as the 300 area.|$|E

5|$|Following General Grant's 1868 presidential victory, the Republicans were {{firmly in}} charge <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> <b>As</b> a result, Hancock found himself transferred, this {{time away from}} the {{sensitive}} assignment of reconstructing the South and into the relative backwater that was the Department of Dakota. The Department covered Minnesota, Montana, and the Dakotas. As in his previous Western command, Hancock began with a conference of the Indian chiefs, but this time was more successful in establishing a peaceful intent. Relations worsened in 1870, however, as an army expedition committed a massacre against the Blackfeet. Relations with the Sioux also became contentious as a result of white encroachment into the Black Hills, in violation of the Treaty of Fort Laramie. Still, war was averted, for the time being, and most of Hancock's command was peaceful.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{believing the}} Iraqi Army would only {{advance to the}} Ramallah oil field, Schwarzkopf was {{surprised}} when the Iraqis captured Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an emergency meeting with President George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 strategic plans were made {{the basis of a}} potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia to counter the Iraqi military. With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered troops into Saudi Arabia on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was very adamant that many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially slow escalation of air power and troop force, not reoccur. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>as</b> uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.|$|E

25|$|As a naval power, Britain {{had a long}} {{record of}} insisting that neutral nations honor its {{blockades}} of hostile countries. From {{the earliest days of}} the war, that perspective would guide the British away from taking any action that might have been viewed <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>as</b> a direct challenge to the Union blockade. From the perspective of the South, British policy amounted to de facto support for the Union blockade and caused great frustration.|$|E

25|$|The Interim Committee on Un-American Activities, most {{commonly}} known as the Canwell Committee, (1947-1949) was a special investigative committee of the Washington State Legislature which in 1948 investigated the influence of the Communist Party USA in Washington state.

25|$|After {{returning}} from World War II, Eisenhower became {{chief of staff}} and Sarafian was the only WAC left with him. During this period, Sarafian would take up the responsibility of writing Eisenhower's memoirs, Crusade in Europe. She received dictations of what to write from Eisenhower who had a habit of dictating passages aloud. In June 18, 1946, Sarafian was appointed 2nd Lieutenant. In early August 1946, Eisenhower visited Brazil, Panama and Mexico. Sarafian was scheduled {{to be a member of}} the expedition, but was forced to remain behind <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>as</b> she became ill. However, she was honored in absentia and later on August 21 in Washington, Colonel James Stack, Eisenhower's aide, awarded her the Brazilian Medal of War on behalf of the government of Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Dokic's next {{scheduled}} tournament was Budapest, but {{she decided}} to withdraw to recover from a hamstring injury.

Dokic then participated <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>as</b> the fourth seed, but her lack of match play saw her fall in the first round to China's Zhang Shuai. She played in San Diego, but was defeated in three tight sets to Ayumi Morita with her 15 double faults being highlighted as the main concern for the match. Since then, Dokic did not play any further matches due to a shoulder injury. Despite this setback, Dokic took part in the main draw of the US Open. She reached the second round but lost to Jelena Janković in straight sets.|$|E

25|$|After Finch {{published}} {{his work in}} 1937, few additional studies were done on volcano hazards in the Lassen area. However, that changed after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the USGS began reevaluating the risks posed by other potentially active volcanoes in the Cascade Range, including those in Lassen Volcanic National Park. Since that time, USGS scientists have been working {{in cooperation with the}} National Park Service to better understand volcano hazards in the Lassen area. As part of this work, the history of Cinder Cone has been reexamined. Most of the features of Cinder Cone have changed little since Harkness first described them in the 1870s, but all of the assumptions on which Finch based his conclusions have now been shown to be incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his failure}} to take power, Khiêm said he was “very happy.

In October 1965 the junta of Kỳ and Thiệu made Khiêm the Ambassador to Taiwan; he served there until mid-1968, then returned to Vietnam and served under President Thiệu as Interior Minister for a year before becoming Deputy Prime Minister {{at the start of}} 1969. In September 1969 he became prime minister and defense minister, and he stayed in the role until April 1975 when he resigned and left the country as the communists {{were in the process of}} completing their victory over South Vietnam. However, he had little power as Thiệu operated virtually one-man rule.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that same}} year, the Capitals signed Jágr to the then-largest {{contract}} ever in NHL history at $77 million over seven years, {{an average annual}} value of $11 million, with an option for an eighth year. Jágr, however, did {{not live up to}} expectations <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>as</b> the Capitals failed to defend their division title and missed the playoffs in 2002. For the first time during his tenure with the Capitals, Jágr failed to finish among the NHL's top scorers, make the post-season or make the NHL All-Star Team. During the summer of 2002, the Capitals reunited Jágr with former linemate Robert Lang.
