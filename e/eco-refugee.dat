It has been the biggest obstacles for not only eco-environment, but also local social and economic development. To prevent further spreading, China’s central government has used national remedial policies such as water conservation, returning farmland to forestry, <b>eco-refugees</b> relocation, etc. Those efforts, however, did not change the deterioration of eco-environment and the increasing difficulty in Minqin County people’s living. The rapid growth rates and extensive distribution of desertification in northern China has become the major problem for regional environmental and social economical development. 30, 000 thousand of Minqin people desperately need an alternative way out that is sensitive to needs for adaptation, capacity building, and ultimately relocation. This thesis looks at the fragmentation in the national policy and explores the cause behind the failed policy in execution. Therefore to develop a multidimensional near-term plan that prolongs Minqin's time while building capacity in anticipation of relocation. The proposed plan intends to involve interwork between different sand control techniques, as well as cooperation between government, NGOs and local people. published_or_final_versionArchitectureMasterMaster of Landscape Architectur...|$|R
