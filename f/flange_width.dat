40|$|Following {{the merger}} of the two {{classification}} societies Det Norske Veritas (DNV) and Germanischer Lloyds (GL) in September 2013 {{the need for a}} harmonized High Speed Craft (HSC) classification rule set emerged. In this study the respective rules for the bottom structure of HSC where checked against each other. This shone light on the similarities and dissimilarities between the two. The main difference found was the methodology used to determine the craft design acceleration, a concept integral to the hull design process. Further the comparative study showed a need to improve the idealisation of sandwich beams. These two topics where chosen as areas of focus {{in the latter part of}} this study. Differences regarding design accelerations led to a review of the source material for DNV’s formulae, the model trials of Fridsma (1971). It was found that the old trials didn’t necessarily capture the worst case scenarios for the model craft in question, due to a limited sea state formulation. It was also found that the exponential distribution is an inadequate assumption for the acceleration peaks of HSC. New trials are hence recommended. As it is today, only the inner skin is considered for calculations of the effective <b>flange</b> <b>width</b> for sandwich beams. It is however well known that both skins contribute to the effective <b>flange</b> <b>width.</b> Consequences are among others that the stresses over the beam are overestimated.

In order to optimise vehicle mass it is desirable to use minimum <b>flange</b> <b>widths,</b> which has implications with respect to the rivet to sheet edge distance and consequently joint quality and strength. The influence of the rivet to sheet edge distance, referred as edge distance, on the quality and strength of self-piercing riveted joints was evaluated using standard aluminium alloy AA 5754 through two groups of samples. For Group 1; the edge distance changed by varying rivet pitch, whilst the samples’ width was kept constant. For Group 2; the different edge distances were obtained by changing sample width, whilst the rivet pitch remained the same. The results showed that the edge distance affects joint quality by altering distortion levels and tearing resistance. The increase in edge distance led to an increase in both lap-shear and coach-peel strength; whilst rivet pitch and specimen width play a minor role in the strength trend.

The new RHFCB is a mono-symmetric structural section made by intermittently rivet fastening two torsionally rigid closed rectangular hollow flanges to a web plate element, which allows section optimisation by selecting appropriate combinations of web and <b>flange</b> <b>widths</b> and thicknesses. However, the current design rules for cold-formed steel sections are not directly applicable to rivet fastened RHFCBs. To date, no investigation has been conducted on their web crippling behaviour and strengths. Hence an experimental study was conducted to investigate the web crippling behaviour and capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs under End Two Flange (ETF) and Interior Two Flange (ITF) load cases. It showed that RHFCBs failed by web crippling, flange crushing and their combinations. Comparison of ultimate web crippling capacities with the predictions from the design equations in AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 showed that the current design equations are unconservative for rivet fastened RHFCB sections under ETF and ITF load cases. Hence new equations were proposed to determine the web crippling capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs.
