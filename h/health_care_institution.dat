5|$|Prevention of {{alcoholism}} may be attempted by regulating and limiting {{the sale of}} alcohol, taxing alcohol to increase its cost, and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment may take several steps. Because of the medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method {{involves the use of}} benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. This can be either given while admitted to a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institution</b> or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Other addictions or mental illness may complicate treatment. After detoxification support such as group therapy or support groups are used to help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group Alcoholics Anonymous. The medications acamprosate, disulfiram, or naltrexone may also be used to help prevent further drinking.|$|E
25|$|For a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institution,</b> {{disclosing}} an unanticipated event {{should be}} made as soon as possible.

The employee disclosing the event to family requires support from risk management, patient safety officers and senior leadership. Disclosures are objectively documented in the medical record.|$|E
25|$|A {{hospital}} is a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institution</b> providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment. The best-known type of {{hospital is}} the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a heart attack. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, {{with large numbers of}} beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialised hospitals include trauma centres, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.|$|E

40|$|There {{are basic}} {{concepts}} {{relating to the}} presented topic, such as supervision and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions,</b> explained in the theoretical part of this master thesis. In its practical part, there are results of the research undertaken {{by means of a}} questionnaire survey and amended by two half-standardized interviews in the end. The questionnaires were sent to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> to the regions of Zlin and South Bohemia. Interviews were done with managers of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions,</b> on in the region of Zlin and the other in the region of South Bohemia. The target of research was to find out if supervisions are really provided in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> in the regions of Zlin and South Bohemia. The partial target of research was to map occurrence of supervision used individual types of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> (in the two mentioned region of Czech Republic). There are two hypotheses stated in the thesis. Hypothesis no. 1 is determined in the following way: ?Supervision is more often used in the region of Zlin than in the region of South Bohemia?. Hypothesis no. 2 is: ?Supervision is more often is ordered by a manager and regarded as a duty than prevention of a ?burnout? by nurses. Neither of the hypotheses is proved. I will be very pleased if the thesis provokes a few people at least to think about issues of supervision in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions.</b> Further, the thesis can serve as study material for students studying the field of health services. And last but not least, the thesis could serve as an initial impulse to perform other researches in the field of supervision in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> in other regions...|$|R
2500|$|For {{institutional}} care, such as {{hospital and}} nursing home care, Medicare uses prospective payment systems. In a prospective payment system, the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institution</b> receives a set {{amount of money}} for each episode of care provided to a patient, regardless of the actual amount of care. The actual allotment of funds {{is based on a}} list of diagnosis-related groups (DRG). The actual amount depends on the primary diagnosis that is actually made at the hospital. There are some issues surrounding Medicare's use of DRGs because if the patient uses less care, the hospital gets to keep the remainder. This, in theory, should balance the costs for the hospital. However, if the patient uses more care, then the hospital has to cover its own losses. This results in the issue of [...] "upcoding," [...] when a physician makes a more severe diagnosis to hedge against accidental costs.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Ambient air {{pollution}} {{in the town of}} Kakanj, mostly of industrial origin, has become a major reason for increased use of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services by {{children under the age of}} six years. The aim of this study was to examine the correlation between ambient concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO 2), suspended particles and nitrogenoxides (NOx), and the frequency/number of visits to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> by children under the age of six years. Material and methods. The investigation was carried out in the period from January to December 2003, in the area of Kakanj and Brnjic. We examined the average number of monthly visits to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> and concentrations of sulphur dioxide, suspended particles and nitrogen oxides in the town of Kakanj. Results. The investigation shows that there is a linear increase of visits to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> in relation to linear increase of concetrations of sulphur dioxide, suspended particles and nitrogen oxides (O<R<+ 1). An increase in visits to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> significantly correlates (0. 05) with the average concetrations of sulphur dioxide (0. 713) and suspended particles (0. 433), and with the average concentrations of nitrogen oxides (0. 901). Discussion. High correlation between the increase in visits to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> and increased concentrations of nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide was also found by Berktas, Jazbec, Transande. Conclusion. Children under the age of six in the town of Kakanj visit <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> considerably more frequently than children of the same age in the village of Brnjic, which significantly correlates with the average monthly concentrations of sulphur dioxide, suspended particles and nitrogen oxides in the air. ...|$|R

40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} is a worldwide threat to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> as it impairs the effective treatment of bacterial infections.

However, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> are not completely independent in their control of the prevalence of resistance, as movement of patients between hospitals and <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> can induce movement of resistant micro-organisms.

40|$|SUMMARY Aim of the study. To {{evaluate}} {{the information on}} admissions due to injuries, accidents and poisonings to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> in the major health databases. Methods. The information about injuries, accidents and poisonings has been evaluated in the certified registration forms and reports, which are filled in at the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions,</b> emergency services, medico-social expertise commission. Comparison of the records on admissions due to injuries in 2003 of the adults (16 years old and over) in the database of Lithuanian Health Information Centre and in the database of State Sickness Fund „SVEIDRA” was performed. The continuity of the data from inpatient to outpatient <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> was analyzed. The more detailed analysis was carried out analyzing two largest groups of traumas: head injuries (S 00 -S 09) and arm and shoulder injuries (S 40 -S 69) in the database of State Sickness Fund „SVEIDRA“. Morbidity rates per 1000 population were calculated. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 11. 00 for Windows. The associations between the variables were measured using the Chi-squared and the Student test. The results were considered statistically significant, when p< 0. 05. Results. Injuries, accidents and poisonings in most forms of the registration were coded according to the medical consequences, and only in few medical registration forms were coded according to external causes. Some forms used different codes for coding external causes, and some forms did not use it at all. In 2003, according to database of Lithuanian Health Information Centre, 293827 inhabitants (84. 9 per 1000 population) admitted to the outpatient <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions,</b> while according to the database of „SVEIDRA“ 365928 inhabitants (105. 7 per 1000 population) were registered. Only the part of registered data in those databases coincided. According to the database of State Sickness Fund „SVEIDRA“, only 41 % of the information on cases, which were registered in Lithuanian inpatient <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions,</b> {{was found in the}} records of primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> in 2003. Mild injuries in the records of outpatient <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> were registered better than severe ones or poisonings.
