25|$|The thermal {{cracking}} reaction is highly endothermic, and is generally {{carried out in}} a <b>fired</b> <b>heater.</b> Even though residence time and temperature are carefully controlled, it produces significant quantities of chlorinated hydrocarbon side products. In practice, EDC conversion is relatively low (50 to 60 percent). The furnace effluent is immediately quenched with cold EDC to stop undesirable side reactions. The resulting vapor-liquid mixture then goes to a purification system. Some processes use an absorber-stripper system to separate HCl from the chlorinated hydrocarbons, while other processes use a refrigerated continuous distillation system.|$|E

40|$|Existing direct <b>fired</b> process <b>heaters</b> {{and steam}} boilers {{can have their}} {{efficiencies}} remarkably improved, and thus cut the fuel bill, by conversion from conventional type natural draft burners to high intensity, "forced draft" type burners. An available type that is "forced draft," but which does not require expenditure of energy for forced draft, will be discussed. Combustion Air is automatically controlled by the fuel flow - which fuel drives the "forced draft" fan to control airflow. Use of such type burners can, in many instances, increase efficiency to a point close enough to that obtainable by addition of air preheat until the difference in efficiency with air preheaters will not justify {{the high cost of}} air preheat systems. Low excess air and short, high intensity flame patterns assure reduction of stack temperature, thus increased efficiency.

50|$|Onshore {{terminals}} {{generally have}} <b>fired</b> <b>heaters</b> followed by separators and coalescers to stabilise the crude and remove any produced water not separated offshore. Onshore separators tend {{to operate at}} a lower pressure than the offshore separators and so more gas is evolved. The associated gas is generally compressed, dew-pointed and exported via a dedicated pipeline. If gas export is uneconomical then it may be flared. Onshore terminals frequently have large crude oil storage tanks to allow offshore production to continue if the export route becomes unavailable. Export to the oil refinery is either by pipeline or tanker.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} cab comfort truck drivers have to idle their engine to obtain the required power for accessories, such as the air conditioner, heater, television, refrigerator, and lights. This idling of the engine has {{a major impact on}} its fuel consumption and exhaust emission. Idling emissions can be as high as 86. 4 g/h, 16, 500 g/h, 5130 g/h, 4 g/h, and 375 g/h for HC, CO 2, CO, PM, and NOx, respectively. Idling fuel consumption rate can be as high as 1. 85 gal/h. The accessory loading, truck model, fuel-injection system, ambient temperature, idling speed, etc., also affect significantly the emission levels and fuel consumption rate. An increase in accessory loading and ambient temperature increases the emissions and fuel consumption. During idling, electronic fuel-injection systems reduce HC, PM, and CO emission, but increase NOx emissions compared with a mechanical fuel-injection system. An increase of idling speed increases fuel consumption rate. There are many systems available on the market to reduce engine idling and improve air quality and fuel consumption rate, such as an auxiliary power unit (APU), truck stop electrification, thermal storage systems, fuel cells, and direct <b>fire</b> <b>heaters.</b> A direct <b>fire</b> <b>heater</b> reduces fuel consumption by 94 - 96 % and an APU reduces consumption by 60 - 87 %. Furthermore, these technologies increase air quality significantly by reducing idling emissions, which is the reason why they are considered as key alternatives to engine idling.

50|$|The liquid feed (at {{the bottom}} {{left in the}} diagram) is pumped up to the {{reaction}} pressure (5-45 atm) and is joined by a stream of hydrogen-rich recycle gas. The resulting liquid-gas mixture is preheated by flowing through a heat exchanger. The preheated feed mixture is then totally vaporized and heated to the reaction temperature (495-520 °C) before the vaporized reactants enter the first reactor. As the vaporized reactants flow through the fixed bed of catalyst in the reactor, the major reaction is the dehydrogenation of naphthenes to aromatics (as described earlier herein) which is highly endothermic and results in a large temperature decrease between the inlet and outlet of the reactor. To maintain the required reaction temperature {{and the rate of}} reaction, the vaporized stream is reheated in the second <b>fired</b> <b>heater</b> before it flows through the second reactor. The temperature again decreases across the second reactor and the vaporized stream must again be reheated in the third <b>fired</b> <b>heater</b> before it flows through the third reactor. As the vaporized stream proceeds through the three reactors, the reaction rates decrease and the reactors therefore become larger. At the same time, the amount of reheat required between the reactors becomes smaller. Usually, three reactors are all that is required to provide the desired performance of the catalytic reforming unit.|$|E
