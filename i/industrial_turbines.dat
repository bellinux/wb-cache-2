The ATS program will achieve ultrahigh efficiencies, environmental superiority, and cost competitiveness compared with current combustion turbine systems. A {{major factor in the}} improved efficiencies of simple cycle ATS gas turbines will be higher operating efficiencies than curren engines.

40|$|Background: Wind {{turbines}} are a form {{of renewable}} energy, which generate electricity from wind energy, a practice dating back over 100 years. More recently, large-scale wind energy developments have started to employ one or several <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbines,</b> which produce the majority of wind energy in Ontario. The production of electricity from the movement of <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbine</b> motor blades creates both mechanical and aerodynamic noise. This type of environmental noise is a growing public health concern, especially for residents living close to <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbines.</b> A body of evidence now exists to suggest that <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbine</b> noise can impair health and contribute to annoyance and sleep disturbance. However, in Ontario, {{little is known about}} how <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbines</b> impact people living in their vicinity. Objectives: This investigation was a cross-sectional study involving eight Ontario communities that contain greater than ten <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbines.</b> The objectives of this study were to explore the association between proximity to <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbines</b> and self-reported health effects, specifically quality of life (both physical and mental health) and sleep disturbance, in residents living close to wind turbines. Dose-response relationships were also explored in an attempt to investigate acceptable exposure levels and appropriate setback distances for <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbines.</b> Methods: Eight wind farms in Ontario were selected for analysis. For this cross-sectional study, the ‘Quality of Life and Renewable Energy Technologies Study’ survey was used to measure the impact of <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbines</b> on health. Using Canada Post’s Unaddressed Admail Service, surveys were sent to 4, 876 residences near <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbines</b> in these eight communities. Survey responses were sent back to the University of Waterloo and data from the surveys were used for analysis. Descriptive analyses were performed and multiple regression models were run to investigate the effect of the main independent variable of interest (distance to nearest <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbine)</b> on the various outcome variables. Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations were performed on a number of dependent and independent variables including age, sex, time in home, number of <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbines</b> within 2, 000 meters and sleep and health outcomes. Results: In total, 412 surveys were returned (8. 45 % response rate); 16 of these survey respondents did not provide their home address. Therefore, 396 surveys were included in the analysis. The mean self-reported distances of survey respondents to wind farms was 2, 782 meters +- 3, 950 meters (range: 0. 40 - 55, 000 meters). The mean calculated distance from residence to the closest <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbine</b> was 4, 523 meters +- 4, 420 meters (range: 316 - 22, 661 meters). The difference between the calculated and perceived distance measurements was statistically significant (P< 0. 001) with survey respondents reporting that they live, on average, 1, 741 meters closer to wind farms than they actually do. The relationship between Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and ln(distance) was found to be statistically significant (P= 0. 01) when controlling for age, gender and county, meaning that as distance increased (move further away from an <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbine),</b> Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index decreased (i. e. sleep improved) in a logarithmic relationship. Among the eight Wind Turbine Syndrome index variables, the relationship between vertigo and ln(distance) was statistically significant (P< 0. 001) when controlling for age, gender, and county. Additionally, the relationship between tinnitus and ln(distance) approached statistical significance (P= 0. 08) when controlling for age, gender and county. Both vertigo and tinnitus were worse among participants living closer to <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbines.</b> Conclusion: Study findings suggest that <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbines</b> could have an impact on health. Using a sample of rural Ontario residents (although not necessarily representative of the target population), this study explored the quality of life (both physical and mental health) and sleep disturbance of residents living in the vicinity of <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbines.</b> However, because of study limitations, there are many questions still to be answered before firm conclusions can be drawn. Based on {{the findings of this study}} it is recommended that further studies be carried out to examine the effects of low-level stressors, such as <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbine</b> noise, on health. Specifically, study findings suggest that future research should focus on the effects of <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbine</b> noise on sleep disturbance and symptoms of inner ear problems. Although the study findings could suggest that there is a possible association between various health outcomes and how far someone lives from an <b>industrial</b> wind <b>turbine,</b> it is important to remember that there are limitations to these conclusions...|$|R

5000|$|Shaft {{horsepower}} (shp) is {{the power}} delivered to a propeller shaft, a turbine shaft — or to an output shaft of an automotive transmission.

40|$|A DOE {{program with}} Allison Engine Co. will {{demonstrate}} ceramic vanes {{in an industrial}} turbine. First-stage ceramic vanes and metallic mounts are to be designed, fabricated, and operated in a short-term engine test (up to 50 hr).

Thermal and stress analyses of the vanes have calculated acceptable fast fracture stress levels and probabilities of survival > 99. 99 % for turbine continuous power and emergency shutdown (thermal shock) conditions.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a numerical and theoretical investigation of transitional and turbulent enclosed rotating flows, {{with a focus}} on the formation of macroscopic coherent flow structures. The underlying processes are strongly threedimensional due to the presence of boundary layers on the discs and {{on the walls of the}} outer (resp. inner) cylindrical shroud (resp. shaft). The complexity of these flows poses a great challenge in fundamental research however the present work is also of importance for industrial rotating machinery, from hard-drives to space engines turbopumps - the design issues of the latter being behind the motivation for this thesis. The present work consists of two major investigations. First, industrial cavities are modeled by smooth rotor/stator cavities and therein the dominant flow dynamics is investigated. For the experimental campaigns on industrial machinery revealed dangerous unsteady phenomena within the cavities, the emphasis is put on the reproduction and monitoring of unsteady pressure fluctuations within the smooth cavities. Then, the LES of three configurations of real <b>industrial</b> <b>turbines</b> are conducted to study in situ the pressure fluctuations and apply the diagnostics already vetted on academic problems...|$|E
