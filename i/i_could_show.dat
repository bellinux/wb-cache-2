They are both twisted and sophisticated. We tried to {{keep that in mind}} when we did the casting on this film." [...] Bean's role in the film was originally kept to {{the beginning and the end}} of the movie, but due to studio pressure for a male lead, his role was expanded into a subplot. Gans cast Holden after seeing her in The Majestic: [...] "in The Majestic, she was beautifully feminine and I cast her so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>show</b> her other side, make her strong and sleek. Gans saw Ferland as [...] "the ideal actress" [...] after viewing the television show Kingdom Hospital and her screen test for Terry Gilliam's film Tideland. To prepare for her role, Krige read the book The End of Days by Erna Paris, a book about tyranny during the Spanish Inquisition.|$|E

6000|$|... "Was it a sin, a crime?" [...] he inquired, {{somewhat}} startled. I reassured {{him on this}} point, and, as well as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> him {{the mere}} outline of my experience.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would God that I {{had been}} with you every step! Would God, at least, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>show</b> as good a three-years' log-book, Amyas, my lad!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did though! I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>show</b> you the sample. Some Manchester chaps {{said it was}} as good as any Sea Island cotton on the market." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I assure you, if {{you would}} persuade him to talk it over with me, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>show</b> {{him that he would}} involve you all in what would be most distasteful.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I had her picture, Madame," [...] I {{answered}} with enthusiasm, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>show</b> you. You would understand, then, that I am very anxious indeed to be married." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do mean that, mother. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>show</b> him a {{superior}} angel, of course," [...] said Bob {{with a steady}} look at Martha, [...] "but he has done pretty well, on the whole." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I would," [...] replied Albert, {{speaking}} in the character which he had assumed, [...] "that we had met where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>shown</b> thee the difference betwixt a rightful King and an ambitious Usurper!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Then,' {{pursued the}} gentleman, 'this Fagin {{shall not be}} brought to justice without your consent. In such a case <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>show</b> you reasons, I think, which would induce you to yield it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} would be more {{effective}} if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>show</b> the letter itself at large. I have it in my pocket now. You understand how pleased I was to come upon you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I quite {{agree with}} you there. I know I should drown myself or put a bullet through my head if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>show</b> {{ordinary}} courage {{with a lot of}} ladies going on working quietly round me." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{clinched}} my {{fists and}} charged off. How grateful I {{was to him}} for having spoken to me, the outcast of the class, thus publicly, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>show</b> by my exertions to please him. When I drew up before him I was panting hard, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{see that he was}} satisfied.|$|R
6000|$|It was all {{important}} that I should reach Marshal Grouchy, and yet <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>show</b> my nose without being made prisoner. You can think how I cursed and tore my hair. How little {{do we know}} what is in store for us! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Sir Hugh is gone, and {{therefore}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>show</b> him {{that in time}} to do anything; but if I were to do so, he would simply do nothing, and let her go to the hotel in London. Now that would be unkind--would it not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A {{complaint}} which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>show</b> {{the justice}} of more emphatically, than by having to repeat it,' said Mrs Merdle. 'I {{might as well have}} stated it to the wall. I had far better have stated it to the bird. He would at least have screamed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|...
