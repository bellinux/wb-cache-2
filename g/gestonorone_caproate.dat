25|$|High {{doses of}} progestogens exert {{negative}} {{feedback on the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by activating the progesterone receptor. As a result, they have antigonadotropic effects – that is, they suppress the gonadal production of sex hormones such as androgens. As such, sufficient dosages of progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, <b>gestonorone</b> <b>caproate,</b> hydroxyprogesterone caproate, megestrol acetate, and MPA, can considerably lower androgen levels. In addition, certain other progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, drospirenone, and nomegestrol acetate, bind to and block the activation of the androgen receptor. On the other hand, certain other progestogens, including 19-nortestosterone derivatives like levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethisterone, and norethisterone acetate, as well as, to a lesser extent, the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative MPA, have weak androgenic activity because they bind to and activate the androgen receptor similarly to testosterone, and may produce androgenic effects such as acne, hirsutism, and increased sex drive.|$|E
50|$|Like other potent progestins, <b>gestonorone</b> <b>caproate</b> {{possesses}} potent antigonadotropic {{activity and}} {{is capable of}} markedly suppressing the gonadal production and circulating levels of sex hormones such as testosterone and estradiol. A clinical study found that 400 mg/week intramuscular <b>gestonorone</b> <b>caproate</b> suppressed testosterone levels by 75% in men, while orchiectomy as a comparator reduced testosterone levels by 91%.

50|$|<b>Gestonorone</b> <b>caproate</b> is a strong, long-acting, {{and pure}} progestogen, {{possessing}} no androgenic, anabolic, antiandrogenic, estrogenic, antiestrogenic, corticosteroid, or teratogenic effects.

40|$|Recently, gestagen {{therapy is}} made attempt {{as a new}} {{approach}} to the endocrine control of benign prostatic hypertrophy (EPH). Twenty-five patients of BPH in our clinic (out-patients 14, in-patients 11) were treated with <b>Gestonorone</b> <b>Caproate</b> (SH 582), a new strong progestational agent developed by Schering AG Berlin. 200 - 600 mg/week of SH 582 were injected in the outpatients for 45 - 90 days and 200 - 300 mg/day of SH 582 were injected in the in-patients daily for 10 - 25 days. Residual urine, urinary stream, dysuria and nycturia were examined as to clinical effect. The best improvement of residual urine was observed in stage II series of BPH receiving 600 mg/week injection (3 / 5). Urinary stream, dysuria and nycturia improved in stage II patients of BPH that were given 400 - 600 mg/week or 200 mg/day injection (6 - 7 / 19). Side effects were found in two patients, one was anorexia, another was impotence. Abnormal change of blood-picture, liver function, renal function and serum acid-phosphatase after injection of SH 582 were not observed. The results of endocrine studies such as urinary total gonadotropin, neutral 17 KS, 3 fraction of estrogen and 17 OHCS were as follows: Gonadotropin was inhibited by administration of large dose of SH 582. 17 KS decreased slightly and estrone increased about two times to pretreatment level by SH 582. 17 β-estradiol was not changed. Estriol and 17 OHCS increased slightly after injection. The histological findings of prostate were not changed particularly on operated patients (6 cases).

Nineteen patients with stage I and II BPH were divided into 3 groups, i. e. group A, Band C, receiving 100, 200 and 300 mg per week for 12 weeks, respectively. The clinical effects of them were compared each other as to 8 evaluation items and a global judgement. The improvement rate in the global judgement were dose dependent, but no significant difference was shown between group Band C. The necessary dose for the improvement in the principal ones out of 8 categorized items was calculated as 160 mg per week through quantification theory I.

40|$|Various non-surgical {{therapeutic}} modalities such as balloon dilation of the prostatic urethra, hyperthermia of {{the prostate}} and medication with antiandrogens and/or adrenergic blockade have been attempted for the patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) especially in an early stage or in a poor operative risk. The observation that androgen deprivation induces shrinkage of the hyperplastic prostate represents {{the basis for the}} treatment of BPH with antiandrogen. Although several antiandrogens are now in clinical use in our country, there still remain problems to be solved. We reviewed the mechanism of action and the clinical results of antiandrogens in the treatment of BPH. The improvement following antiandrogen therapy occurred among the patients with symptomatic BPH, in 50 - 80 % subjectively and in 40 - 50 % objectively. The therapy appeared to be more effective in an early stage of the disease. However, the limitation of the duration of the effects and unfavorable side effects should also be noticed. The progestational agents such as <b>gestonorone</b> <b>caproate,</b> chlormadinone acetate and allylestrenol suppress more or less sexual function by interference of the pituitary-gonadal axis. Besides, coincidental prostate cancer must be excluded since antiandrogen therapy might hinder the natural course of the cancer...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>gestonorone</b> <b>caproate</b> (GC) on the pituitary-gonadal axis was studied in 14 {{patients}} with {{benign prostatic hypertrophy}} (BPH). The drug was injected {{once a week for}} 12 weeks at the dosage of 200 mg, and after that once every 2 weeks for 12 weeks at the same dosage. LH-RH loading tests were done before therapy, every 6 weeks from the start of therapy and 12 to 20 weeks after cessation of therapy. The clinical response to BPH was also evaluated by routine urological examinations. Gonadotropin (Gn), testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were measured at every LH-RH test. T and DHT were markedly depressed around week 6, then gradually elevated despite the continued administration of GC. These values returned to the pretreatment level by 20 weeks after therapy. As Gn release was inhibited by LH-RH administration, GC {{may play a role in}} lowering the T and DHT levels. The clinical effect on BPH was first noticed at week 4 - 6, and lasted at least for 12 to 20 weeks after cessation of the treatment. The mechanism of the effects seemed to be due to the depressed T level, though the possibility of a direct anti-androgenic action of this drug as has been suggested from the animal experiments cannot be excluded...|$|E
