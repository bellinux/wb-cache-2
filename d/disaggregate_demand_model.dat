40|$|Recent {{evidence}} from aggregate models of automobile demand indicates that, when not corrected for quality differences, market price elasticity of demand is substantially biased downwards. This note presents new information on market price and income elasticities {{derived from a}} <b>disaggregate</b> <b>demand</b> <b>model</b> that controls for cost, household income, vehicle attributes and perceived quality, consumer search, and manufacturer. Based on an extensive household survey of new vehicle purchasers in 1989, market price and income elasticities {{are estimated to be}} - 0. 87 and 1. 70, respectively. Moreover, excluding vehicle quality from a well-specified model is found to have little effect upon the estimated market elasticities. Copyright 1996 by MIT Press. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Fourt Generation of Strategic Passenger Transport Models for Flanders {{are being}} {{developed}} to meet three objectives. It includes a Population Simulator to generate reliable population inputs for a <b>disaggregate</b> <b>demand</b> <b>model,</b> the demand model is based on disaggregate tour-based mobility demand model, which also includes a departure time choice model to improve the sensitivity to increasing congestion and congestion charging. Finally the model is updated to the base year. This article describes {{the development of the}} population simulator and mobility demand model. The population simulator simulates the demographic evolution of the Flemish population from 2001 to the new base year 2013 and subsequently for a given year in the future. The disaggregate choice models in the mobility-demand model are are estimated on the OVG and OWoWi surveys. The presented demand models are being implemented in a microsimulation application. In effect, the passenger transport model is sensitive to changes in the composition of the population and infrastructure developments...|$|E
30|$|However, {{should a}} certain {{predictive}} capacity be required, {{it is necessary}} to make use of a disaggregate estimation of the O–D matrix which consists in specifying (i.e. providing the functional form and related variables), calibrating (i.e. determining numerical values of model parameters) and validating (i.e. verifying the ability of the model to reproduce original data), by means of proper information, a model which manages to reproduce the variations in travel demand as a result of modifications in transport system performance or socio-economic conditions. In this case, two different survey approaches can be implemented: the revealed preference (RP) approach [179], which is based on the use of data related to real traveller behaviour, and the stated preference (SP) approach [180, 181], based on the statements of travellers related to their potential choices {{in the case of a}} hypothetical scenario, which has to be appropriately described and illustrated in order to make user declarations as reliable as possible. With the use of the second approach, the predictive capabilities of calibrated demand models can be improved. Hence, once the functional formulation of the model, together with the types of attributes to be considered, has been specified, {{it is necessary to}} carry out the calibration phase by means of which a numerical value is associated with each parameter involved. Generally, in order to calibrate a <b>disaggregate</b> <b>demand</b> <b>model,</b> the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method is performed [179].|$|E

The technique, which uses a multivariate normal approximation for the distribution of the vector of attributes, is based on the multinomial profit algorithm proposed by Daganzo, Bouthelier and Sheffi (1977) and can be applied to an arbitrary number of alternatives. The procedure is computationally so efficient that it enables us to calibrate disaggregate models with aggregate data by maximum likelihood using the same or slightly modified codes developed for disaggregated data. The paper also contains a small scale numerical example intended to illustrate the important highlights of the aggregation-estimation problem. ...|$|R
3000|$|According to Hauser, Tybout, and Koppelman (1981) “efforts to {{understand}} consumer transportation behavior {{began in the}} late 1950 s with aggregate studies correlating system characteristics (e.g. travel time, frequency, cost, etc.) and community characteristics (e.g. income, education, density, etc.) with demand for transportation alternatives” [2]. After a couple of decades, it was obvious that although these models performed well in specific circumstances, they did not adequately represent consumer behavior and, moreover, they were not able to provide appropriate guidance for the development of strategies able to directly influence transportation behavior [2]. Therefore, in the early 1970 s, <b>disaggregate</b> <b>demand</b> <b>models</b> were developed that examined travel choice behavior on the level of the individual consumer in order to improve its prediction. <b>Disaggregate</b> transportation <b>demand</b> <b>models</b> were thoroughly studied in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (see [3, 4]). The disaggregate travel behavior models, provide a clearer view {{of the relationship between the}} characteristics of transport modes, users’ demographics, and travel choice than did the previous aggregate models. However, they concentrate on observed systems and community characteristics (i.e. on the phenomenology of the transport demand). Thus, according to Hauser et al. [2] “they fail to provide a complete understanding of the consumer’s transportation decision-making processes and are not sensitive to the wide range of strategies that can be developed to influence consumer behavior without expensive changes in system characteristics”. Moreover, and most importantly, they just observe individual travel behaviors; the real question is how to change them! [...]...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the methodological developments in the DIDAM (<b>Disaggregated</b> <b>demand</b> and assignment <b>models</b> for combined passengers and freight transport) research project, which aims at advancing fundamental research in transportation modelling and analysis, using two complementary methodologies. The first is to develop a joint methodological approach for both freight and passenger transport, and the second is to base this common approach on the use of models that are as disaggregate and realistic as possible. Furthermore, the methods will be designed to cope with the important question of competition for infrastructure. The project is mainly organized around two themes. Each of them covers both freight and passengers aspects, in a manner which promotes collaborative work between the partners of the project. The first theme is concerned with <b>disaggregate</b> <b>demand</b> <b>modelling</b> issues, the second deals with innovative aspects of (joint) traffic assignment. Working at a fully disaggregate level is however not always easy. If such models are already available for passenger <b>demand</b> and traffic, <b>disaggregate</b> tools are still largely missing for freight transport. This is not only true at the operational level, but, more crucially, at the conceptual level. This is why our research program adopts, in this domain, a progressive approach that introduces disaggregation gradually into existing methods and models. This entails research in a full spectrum of issues, ranging from concepts definition (who are the actors, how can they be characterized [...] .) to validation exercises using available data source...|$|R

50|$|Travel demand {{theory was}} {{introduced}} in the appendix on traffic generation. The core of the field is the set of models developed following work by Stan Warner in 1962 (Strategic Choice of Mode in Urban Travel: A Study of Binary Choice). Using data from the CATS, Warner investigated classification techniques using models from biology and psychology. Building from Warner and other early investigators, <b>disaggregate</b> <b>demand</b> <b>models</b> emerged. Analysis is disaggregate in that individuals are the basic units of observation, yet aggregate because models yield a single set of parameters describing the choice behavior of the population.

Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley (especially Daniel McFadden, who won a Nobel Prize in Economics for his efforts) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Moshe Ben-Akiva) (and in MIT associated consulting firms, especially Cambridge Systematics) developed what has become known as choice <b>models,</b> direct <b>demand</b> <b>models</b> (DDM), Random Utility Models (RUM) or, in its most used form, the multinomial logit model (MNL).|$|R

Design/methodology/ approach - The recently developed bounds testing approach to cointegration to test for a long run relationship is used, while the autoregressive distributed lag model is used {{to estimate}} short run and long run elasticities. These methodologies are shown to perform well in small sample sizes, particularly given that the bounds F-test critical values for small sample sizes generated by Narayan in 2004 and 2005 are used.

40|$|Public {{concern about}} {{energy-related}} environmental damage has {{put pressure on}} governments to enhance abatement policies. This has in turn led to increasing demands for information about and analysis of expected and optimal levels of environmental quality, and the means of influencing these levels. Energy <b>demand</b> <b>modelling</b> {{can act as a}} valuable tool in the production of this information, particularly where it relates to future levels of environmental quality and to how policy intervention can alter constraints facing consumers in order to achieve desired levels. The thesis focuses on two features of energy demand analysis. First, major developments in dynamic econometrics, and in particular the cointegration approach, have enabled energy demand modellers to incorporate long run equilibrating relationships between energy use and its main determinants, such as economic activity and relative prices, within a dynamic framework. Second, the existence of a diverse market for energy both in terms of the fuels used and the users suggests that energy demand should be analysed at a disaggregated level. The purpose of this thesis is to examine whether <b>disaggregated</b> dynamic energy <b>demand</b> <b>modelling</b> can provide additional valuable information for the formulation of environmental policy. The core of the thesis takes the form of six separate papers: three review papers link dynamic energy <b>demand</b> <b>modelling</b> with environmental policy and three case study papers use <b>disaggregated</b> dynamic energy <b>demand</b> <b>modelling</b> to examine aspects of future United Kingdom energy-related environmental quality and how it can be altered through changing the constraints facing consumers. While theory and traditional econometrics have provided useful information about energy consumption behaviour, the introduction of the cointegration approach and the error correction model are enabling economists to estimate more reliably the long run relationships between energy demand and its main determinants, and the gradual adjustment of consumers towards equilibrium consumption levels after a disequilibrating disturbance. This new information is giving a greater understanding of how to achieve desired future environmental quality levels. The heterogeneous nature of energy use, both in terms of the fuels used and their users, indicates that the accuracy of elasticity estimates and, thus, the quality of information they can provide for environmental policy might be improved through the disaggregation of dynamic energy <b>demand</b> <b>modelling.</b> Employing the cointegration approach and sectoral and fuel specific error correction models to generate estimates of income, three separate papers provide evidence in support of this argument. Individually, these papers provide information about sectoral and fuel specific elasticities, about how residential users alter their behaviour as economic constraints change and about how certain car users alter their fuel consumption patterns when provided with adverse environmental publicity about fuels. Together, these papers suggest that there exists considerable variation in income and real price elasticities between sectors and fuels, and that using the estimates generated by such disaggregated dynamic models will provide greater accuracy than aggregated and static models. These variations are of particular importance to environmental policy makers because of the difference in environmental impact associated with different fuels. The thesis, therefore, finds that, by generating more detailed and reliable elasticity estimates, <b>disaggregated</b> dynamic energy <b>demand</b> <b>models</b> provide new and valuable insights for the formulation of environmental policy. It concludes that <b>disaggregated</b> dynamic energy <b>demand</b> <b>modelling</b> will form an increasing share of the models used for environmental forecasts and policy analysis - although the overall interest in this area of research may shift as levels of certain energy-related environmental indicators improve (eg carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) and others worsen (eg volatile organic compounds and PM 10). The thesis suggests that considerable refinements in energy <b>demand</b> <b>modelling</b> can be made, both in the methods used and in the focus of empirical studies, which will lead to further improvements in the formulation of environmental policy...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of consumer demands {{is limited by}} data availability. Typically, aggregate consumption and expenditure data are all that is available to draw conclusions based on the theory of individual consumer behavior. Such limitations are problematic as some demand systems possess non-linear Engel effects. Non-linear Engel effects imply differences in demand responses across heterogeneous individuals. These effects may invalidate arguments justifying estimation of per capita demands based on aggregate data. Given that disaggregate data are frequently not available, assumptions are employed to restrict individual demands to obtain empirically tractable aggregate demand functions. However, these restrictions often exclude the possibility of non-linear Engel effects. ^ The objective {{of this study is}} to develop a numerical scheme for dealing with the aggregation of consumer demands. Rather than directly estimating an aggregate <b>demand</b> <b>model</b> whose form and restrictions are inherited from the form and restrictions of individual <b>demands,</b> unobservable <b>disaggregate</b> <b>demands</b> and expenditure distributions are recovered in a manner consistent with observable information. This is accomplished using maximum entropy and traditional econometric methods to simultaneously estimate parameters of a demand system, and recover the unobserved expenditure distributions and <b>disaggregate</b> <b>demands.</b> Key to the recovery process are conditions ensuring the recovered distributions reflect known information regarding the actual distribution, and that recovered <b>disaggregate</b> <b>demands</b> add up to the known level of aggregate demand. ^ This scheme is used to model international consumption patterns with an implicit, directly additive demand system (AIDADS). AIDADS is desirable as it has potentially non-linear Engel effects. However, this non-linearity limits it usefulness in directly <b>modeling</b> aggregate <b>demands.</b> Nevertheless, when account is taken of the distribution of expenditure via the numerical aggregation scheme, results are more plausible than when <b>demands</b> are <b>modeled</b> using aggregate data alone. <b>Modeling</b> <b>disaggregate</b> <b>demand</b> rather aggregate demand allows for estimation of more meaningful subsistence levels for consumption of individual goods such as food, clothing and shelter. Consequences of estimating AIDADS based on country-level cross sectional data versus a disaggregate approach that recognizes there is a distribution of expenditure within each country are evaluated via a demand projections exercise. ...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{of first}} {{generation}} transport models have {{for some time}} been heavily criticised for their lack of behavioural content and inefficient use of data; more recently second generation or <b>disaggregate</b> travel <b>demand</b> <b>models</b> based on a theory of choice between discrete alternatives have also been viewed critically. First, {{it has been argued}} that implemented structures [...] and particularly the Multinomial Logit model [...] have not been sufficiently general to accommodate the "interaction" between alternatives; and second, and perhaps more importantly, that the underpinning theory, involving a perfectly discriminating rational man (homo economicus), endowed with complete information is an unacceptable starting point for the analysis of behaviour. In this paper the potential errors in forecasting travel response arising from theoretical misrepresentation are investigated; more generally, the problems of inference and hypothesis testing in conjuction with cross-sectional models are noted. A framework is developed to examine the consequences of the divergence between the behaviour of individuals in a system, the observed, and that description of their behaviour (which is embedded in a forecasting model) imputed by an observer, the modeller. The extent of this divergence in the context of response to particular policy stimuli is examined using Monte Carlo simulation for the following examples: (i) alternative assumptions relating to the structure of models reflecting substitution between similar alternatives; (ii) alternative decision-making processes; (iii) limited information and "satisficing" behaviour; and (iv) existence of habit in choice modelling. The method has allowed particular conclusions to be nade about the importance of theoretical misrepresentation in the four examples. More generally, it highlights the problems of forecasting response with cross-sectional models and draws attention to the problem of validation which is all too often associated solely with the goodness of statistical fit of analytic functions to data patterns. ...|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{demand for}} rail {{transportation}} {{has traditionally been}} analyzed by means of aggregate <b>demand</b> systems and <b>disaggregate</b> discrete choice models. It is remarkable however that no serious efforts {{have been made to}} develop a <b>disaggregate</b> structural <b>demand</b> <b>model,</b> which takes account of the fact that consumers face a nonlinear budget constraint. It is argued that the use of such a model is necessary, because individuals typically have the opportunity to choose between many different types of tickets. It is therefore clear that consumer demand for transportation not only depends on price, but also that the 'consumption' of a certain amount of transportation will have causal influence on price. An important distinction between the present case and earlier studies of 'discrete/continuous goods', such as labor supply and electricity demand, concerns the nature of the discrete choice: While in earlier applications one single simultaneous choice is made for both the discrete and the continuous choice, the demand for transportation requires two explicit choices - a discrete choice for mode and/or ticket type and a continuous choice for the amount of transportation. Evidence from our data suggests that the explicit nature of the discrete choice is likely to lead to an extra source of optimization error as compared to Hausman's 1985 overview, which means that many observed combinations of discrete and continuous choice are demonstrably suboptimal - regardless of individual preferences. Estimation of the model for non-peak hour travelers by train in the Netherlands shows that the (absolute value of the) price elasticity of the demand for train kilometers equals about unity, and that the income elasticity is fairly small (about 0. 05). It is suggested that the estimated model can be extended in many ways. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{transportation}} planning research, the major emphasis {{in recent years}} has been laid on <b>disaggregate</b> behavioural traffic <b>demand</b> <b>models.</b> Nevertheless, there is also a strong and continued need for further research in the area of conventional aggregate model techniques. Herein, from a mathematical point of view, the basic models of traffic distribution, namely the gravity and the entropy models, are most fascinating. Conventional solution techniques for these models do not utilize the full power of the modern statistical concepts. The author has undertaken the task to develop and calibrate a comprehensive statistical approach for the estimation of model parameters within the concept and framework of the gravity and the entropy models. He has applied the principles of the maximum likelihood technique to a degree that it can be used in practice. By applying the new technique to a considerable number of real world cases of traffic data for selected cities and regions, he has demonstrated its feasibility. Interpretations indicate, however, that the quality of the achievable results can not be improved beyond the maximum allowed by fundamental (underlying) gravity and entropy models. Also, the quality of the available data has, of course, a limiting effect on the performance of the modelling technique. in summary, the research has created a new and practically applicable traffic <b>demand</b> <b>modelling</b> technique for the step of traffic distribution based on a sound statistical theory.

40|$|Global {{general and}} partial {{equilibrium}} models {{focused on the}} agricultural sector can help policy makers do ex-ante analysis by providing a variety of macro-level outcomes, such as changes in flows of international trade, {{and changes in the}} supply, demand, and prices of globally traded commodities. IFPRI’s IMPACT model (International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade) model is one such model. Since its inception nearly 20 years ago the model has evolved to inform increasingly complex and nuanced policy issues, such as the explicit modeling of water use and the productive response of agriculture to climate change. However, on the demand side it has remained a fairly blunt instrument. One oft mentioned shortcoming of global food policy models such as IMPACT model is that they treat national populations as a single composite consumer. As (relatively) wealthier urban and poorer rural populations exhibit different demand characteristics, have different base levels of food consumption, and have different levels of wealth, assigning a single representative consumer for an entire country could result in misleading results regarding both global prices and consumption and the food security of the poorer segments of the population. In this poster we present a global partial equilibrium food security <b>model</b> with <b>disaggregated</b> <b>demand.</b> Working from the IMPACT model, we divided national populations into their urban and rural components. Studies have shown that rural and urban consumers, as well as poor and rich consumers, have structurally different food demands. Accordingly, we assign different demand elasticities (price and income), different base consumption (at the commodity level), and different incomes to sub-populations populations within each country.   We have completed an extensive study of the food demand literature, using the findings to develop parameters to represent the structural differences in urban and rural food demand (see right for explanation of this process). We use rural/urban population and income data and projections from the UN to complete the disaggregation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{presentation}} is to analyze the labor market effects of a congestion charge when commuters have continuously distributed value of time. Since a congestion charge raises the cost of commuting to work, it can decrease employment at the extensive margin {{in a similar way}} as an income tax. Without any form of revenue recycling, the resulting welfare loss from the decreased employment can even exceed the Pigouvian welfare gain from internalizing the congestion externality. A common conclusion in the literature, when comparing different revenue recycling schemes, is that it in general is more effective to use the revenues to cut taxes in the labor market compared to subsidizing public transport or returning them in a lump-sum transfer. A critical assumption in many of the previous cost-benefit analyses of congestion charges is however that there only exists a single value of time. This is somewhat surprising since one of the main features of a congestion charge is that it sorts people according to their value of time, given the existence of feasible transport alternatives. This paper intends to challenge this conclusion by analyzing how previous results hold if we, instead of using a representative individual, consider a population with a continuously distributed value of time. The model used in the paper is created with the Stockholm congestion charging trial in mind, but the analysis can just as well be applied to any city with a well developed public transport service. In the paper a simple traffic model is embedded within a general equilibrium framework where a large number of individuals with different values of time choose labor supply at the extensive margin and mode of transportation. In contrast to previous models, a modal-choice approach is used to model how the value of time for different individuals affects their choice of travel mode. The <b>disaggregated</b> travel <b>demand</b> <b>model</b> makes it possible to analyze how self-selection of mode choice affects labor supply, total welfare and the relative performance of the different revenue recycling schemes. Special attention will also be given to the distributional impacts of the different recycling schemes...|$|R

40|$|<b>Disaggregate</b> <b>demand</b> in the {{marketplace}} exists on a grid determined by the package sizes offered by manufacturers and retailers. While consumers may want to purchase a continuous-valued amount of a product, realized purchases are constrained by available package sizes. This constraint might not be problematic for high-volume demand, but it is potentially troubling when demand is small. Despite the prevalence of packaging constraints on choice, economic models of choice {{have been slow to}} deal with their effects on parameter estimates and policy implications. In this paper we propose a general framework for dealing with indivisible <b>demand</b> in economic <b>models</b> of choice, and show how to estimate model parameters using Bayesian methods. Analyses of simulated data and a scanner-panel dataset of yogurt purchases indicate that ignoring packaging constraints can severely bias parameter estimates and measures of model fit, which results in the inaccurate measures of metrics such as price elasticity and compensating value.
