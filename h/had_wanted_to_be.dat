Stair and touring in his productions.|$|E

25|$|The {{right to}} be heard was found to have been contravened in Kay Swee Pin v. Singapore Island Country Club (2008). The {{appellant}} had applied {{to be a member of}} the respondent club, and had declared in the application form that a certain individual was her spouse. Soon after, the club's general committee discovered that there were discrepancies in the appellant's marriage certificate. The general committee then charged the appellant with falsely declaring that the individual was her spouse, and referred the matter to the club's disciplinary committee which came to the opposite conclusion. The general committee declined to adopt the disciplinary committee's conclusion and subsequent recommendations, and terminated the appellant's membership. One of the grounds of the appeal was that there had been breaches of natural justice because, among other things, the appellant had not been given an opportunity to respond to the general committee in the first place. On the Court of Appeal's behalf, Chan Sek Keong C.J. ruled for the appellant. He held that if the general committee <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the primary fact finder, then it should have allowed the appellant to respond to the allegations of discrepancies in her marriage certificate. Moreover, since the disciplinary committee had heard the appellant and found her explanation credible, the general committee should have asked itself why the former had so concluded.|$|E
25|$|That year, Harvard {{sent its}} varsity team to Poughkeepsie to race Cornell, Pennsylvania, and Columbia {{in the annual}} Intercollegiate Rowing Association Regatta. Courtney’s team beat all three schools {{with a time of}} 19 minutes and 22.9 seconds for the four mile (6km) course. The next year, Harvard and Yale ended their dispute when Walter Camp {{representing}} Yale agreed to Harvard's demands for the next five years. One of Harvard’s demands was that they meet in all athletics that each school sponsored. Yale <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> selective on which teams played each other. As part of an agreement between the two schools, their rowing teams were to meet in Poughkeepsie, New York during the 1897 season. Since Harvard had already agreed to meet Cornell they were also included. Even given their past success, Courtney and his crew were given little chance to win a race against Harvard and Yale. The coaches of both of his opponents were on record that they both would beat Cornell. Gamblers and bookmakers made Cornell a heavy underdog. Newspaper writers before the meet said that Cornell was not in the same class as Harvard and Yale. They also criticized Cornell’s stroke as weak and in bad form. Even with the odds stacked against Cornell, Courtney believed his team could win, especially after seeing his competition row in practice. Courtney believed that losing would mean the end of Cornell's fight for recognition.|$|E

On the beach, people arrived with carts hoping to salvage any cargo washed ashore. None made any effort to rescue the crew or passengers of the Elizabeth, though they were only 50 yards from shore. Most of those aboard attempted to swim to shore, leaving Fuller and Ossoli and Angelino some of the last on the ship. Ossoli was thrown overboard by a massive wave and, after the wave had passed, a crewman who witnessed the event said Fuller could not be seen.|$|E
500|$|Although first {{documented}} in 1104, {{the book is}} presumed to have been buried with Cuthbert at Lindisfarne, and to have stayed with the body during the wanderings forced by the Viking invasions two centuries later.

[...] His burial was first disturbed eleven years after his death, when his remains were moved to behind the altar to reflect his recognition, in the days before a formal process of canonisation, as a saint. [...] The sarcophagus was opened and his body was said to have been found perfectly preserved or incorrupt.
