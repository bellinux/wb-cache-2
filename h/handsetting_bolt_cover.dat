50|$|To {{gain the}} {{superior}} hitting {{power of the}} larger 7.7mm cartridge, several caliber 6.5mm Type 38 rifles were modified for the new round. Although the tests proved satisfactory, the army decided that the added recoil and larger chambering for the 7.7mm cartridge, would require an entirely new rifle for the cartridge. It utilized a cock-on-closing action and an unusual safety mechanism, operated by pressing in the large knurled disk {{at the rear of}} the bolt with the palm of the hand and rotating it in a 1/8 clockwise turn, which is often misunderstood by Western shooters who are used to the Mauser's thumb lever safety. It featured a quick-release bolt and antiaircraft sights, as well as a sliding <b>bolt</b> <b>cover</b> and monopod. The <b>bolt</b> <b>cover,</b> in particular, was highly problematic. Many soldiers simply discarded them due to excessive rattling. As a bolt-action rifle, the Type 99 was a very solid weapon, but as with all manually operated rifles used during World War II, they were in most close combat situations outclassed by semi-automatic rifles and submachine guns.|$|R
50|$|The rifle shared many {{features}} {{with the}} Arisaka rifle, {{such as a}} two-part stock, a ovoid bolt handle, and double-gas escape ports on the receiver. It also had a sliding <b>bolt</b> <b>cover</b> that attached to the bolt, and was removable. Another similarity it had with the Arisaka was the bolt being bored from the rear, {{in order to allow}} room for a mainspring, which was fixed in by the use of a large housing.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the effect of rock bolt corrosion on time-dependent system reliability of anchored rock slopes. First, a corrosion degradation model for reinforcing steel bars in concrete is selected to model the uniform corrosion of rock bolts. Second, two typical failure modes of rock bolts due to corrosion and the resultant slope failure modes are identified. Subsequently, a Monte Carlo simulation-based reliability approach is proposed to perform system reliability analysis of anchored rock slopes. Finally, {{an example of an}} anchored rock slope is worked out {{to investigate}} the effect of rock bolt corrosion on the time-dependent reliability of the anchored rock slope. The results indicate that the probability of slope failure upon yield failure of rock bolts at the free length only increases slightly with time. On the contrary, the probability of slope failure upon bond failure at the bolt-grout interface increases dramatically with time. The system probability of failure of the anchored rock slope decreases with increasing thickness of <b>bolt</b> <b>cover</b> and increases with increasing water-cement ratio of the grout. During the design and construction of pre-stressed rock bolts, a certain thickness of <b>bolt</b> <b>cover</b> should be guaranteed and the water-cement ratio of the grout should be strictly controlled to enhance the long-term stabilization effect of rock bolts.

Axisymmetric turbulent flow is assumed using a mixing length turbulence model. Calculations for the non-plane discs are compared with plane disc calculations and also with the available experimental data.

For the cobbed and plane discs, Nusselt numbers are calculated for a combination of flow rates and rotational speeds; these show some discrepancies with the experiments, although the calculations exhibit the more consistent trend...|$|R

The work shows {{the application of the}} component method to the prediction of stiffness of the cover plate connections. The component bolt/plate in bearing is evaluated. A special attention is paid to the modelling of the bolt force distribution for different bolt tolerances...|$|R

50|$|A dustcap {{may also}} refer, on a bicycle, to the crankarm <b>bolt</b> <b>cover.</b> It {{is usually a}} piece of metal or plastic that, on the crankarm, is snapped or screwed into the {{threaded}} counterbore, which houses the bolt that holds the crankarm to its axle, the bottom bracket spindle. The dustcap serves to protect the threads (on {{the inside of the}} counterbore), which are used with a crankarm puller to remove the crankarm from the spindle. It is also possible for the crank arm to squirm on the bottom bracket spindle, causing the crankarm nut/bolt to become loose, leading to the nut/bolt working its way out of the bottom bracket spindle. The dust cap limits the amount of dangerous loosening that can occur.|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{engineering}} accidents have demonstrated that the failures of rock bolts are mainly induced by the corrosion of reinforcing steel bars. This study aims to investigate the effect of rock bolt corrosion on the system reliability of anchored rock slopes. A uniform corrosion model for rock bolts and its applicable environmental conditions are first examined based on systematical analysis of the existing corrosion models for reinforcing steel bars and the experiment data for rock bolt corrosion. Two failure modes related to rock bolt corrosion are determined. They are the yield failure mode of rock bolts at free section and the bond failure mode at the bolt-grout interface, respectively. Then, the failure models of anchored rock slope corresponding to those of rock bolts are established. A method for estimating the time-variant system reliability of rock slopes based on Monte Carlo simulation is presented. Consequently, an example of anchored rock slope with a single slip surface is presented {{to demonstrate the validity}} and capability of the proposed methods. The results indicate that the corrosion model proposed by K. A. T. Vu and M. G. Stewart is suitable for rock bolts subjected to environmental conditions of humidity and drying/wetting cycles. The rock bolt corrosion at free section has a more significant influence on the stability of rock slopes at the early stage, whereas the effect of rock bolt corrosion at anchored section becomes more obvious at the later stage. Moreover, the variations in the anchored force of each rock bolt and the system probability of slope failure at the later stage are more significant than those at the early stage. The system probability of slope failure decreases with the increasing thickness of the rock <b>bolt</b> <b>cover,</b> while increases with the increasing water-to-cement ratio of the grout. However, the system probability of slope failure does not significantly increase with time, when the thickness of the rock <b>bolt</b> <b>cover</b> and water-to-cement ratio of the grout reach certain values, respectively...|$|R

50|$|Selection of {{appropriate}} PPE, given a certain task to be performed, is normally handled {{in one of}} two possible ways. The first method is to consult a hazard category classification table, like that found in NFPA 70E Table 130.7(C)(15)(a) lists a number of typical electrical tasks by various voltage levels and recommends the category of PPE that should be worn. For example, when working on 600 V switchgear and performing a removal of <b>bolted</b> <b>covers</b> to expose bare, energized parts, the table recommends a Category 3 Protective Clothing System. This Category 3 system corresponds to an ensemble of PPE that together offers protection up to 25 cal/cm² (105 J/cm² or 1.05 MJ/m²). The minimum rating of PPE necessary for any category is the maximum available energy for that category. For example, a Category 3 arc-flash hazard requires PPE rated for no less than 25 cal/cm² (1.05 MJ/m²).|$|R
