40|$|Context: The winter seeing at Concordia is {{essentially}} bimodal, excellent or quite poor, with relative proportions {{that depend on}} altitude above the snow surface. This paper studies the temporal behavior of the <b>good</b> <b>seeing</b> sequences. Aims: An efficient exploitation of extremely <b>good</b> <b>seeing</b> with an adaptive optics system needs long integrations. It is then important to explore the temporal distribution of the fraction of time providing excellent seeing. Methods: Temporal windows of <b>good</b> <b>seeing</b> are created by a simple binary process. Good or bad. Their autocorrelations are corrected for those of the existing data sets, since these are not continuous, being often interrupted by technical problems {{in addition to the}} adverse weather gaps. At the end these corrected autocorrelations provide the typical duration of <b>good</b> <b>seeing</b> sequences. This study has to be a little detailed as its results depend on the season, summer or winter. Results: Using a threshold of 0. 5 arcsec to define the "good seeing", three characteristic numbers are found to describe the temporal evolution of the <b>good</b> <b>seeing</b> windows. The first number is the mean duration of an uninterrupted <b>good</b> <b>seeing</b> sequence: it is τ_ 0 = 7. 5 hours at 8 m above the ground (15 hours at 20 m). These sequences are randomly distributed in time, with a negative exponential law of damping time τ_ 1 = 29 hours (at elevation 8 m and 20 m). The third number is the mean time between two 29 hours episodes. It is T= 10 days at 8 m high (5 days at 20 m). Comment: 4 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
