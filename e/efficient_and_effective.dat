Upon returning to the U.S. in 1985, he modeled the Metaphors of Identity. This model states that an individual's strategies and behavior patterns are informed by deeply structured metaphors for life, self, desired outcomes and challenges. By adopting new metaphors, an individual can create new pathways to transformation.|$|E

25|$|Vector {{graphics}} formats are complementary to raster graphics. Raster graphics is {{the representation}} of images as an array of pixels and is typically used for {{the representation of}} photographic images.

There are instances when working with vector tools and formats is best practice, and instances when working with raster tools and formats is best practice.

25|$|Then black teas are {{processed}} {{in either of}} two ways, CTC (Crush, Tear, Curl) or orthodox. The CTC method produces leaves of fannings or dust grades that are commonly used in tea bags but also produces higher (broken leaf) grades such as BOP CTC and GFBOP CTC (see gradings below for more details). This method is <b>efficient</b> <b>and</b> <b>effective</b> for producing a better quality product from medium and lower quality leaves of consistently dark color. Orthodox processing is done either by machines or by hand. Hand processing is used for high quality teas. While the methods employed in orthodox processing differ by tea type, this style of processing results in the high quality loose tea sought by many connoisseurs. The tea leaves are allowed to completely oxidize.|$|E
