5|$|At the 2009 TGS event, it was {{revealed}} that Hope's silver hair was meant for Lightning, but when her hair color was decided as pink, <b>Hope</b> received the silver hair coloring instead. Hope's Academy uniform for XIII-2 was designed by Hideo Minaba. While he was portrayed as sensitive and vulnerable in XIII, for XIII-2, the game's director wished to portray <b>Hope</b> as a more mature, authoritative person. According to Toriyama, how <b>Hope</b> matured, as seen through Lightning's eyes, formed one of the main story themes for Lightning Returns. He was originally going to have a third unique design for the game, but the team eventually decided to settle on his original teenage appearance. In a later interview, he said that while the character was much liked by the team, he felt that <b>Hope</b> lacked the heroic image that could make him a leading character. Watanabe later said that he felt <b>Hope</b> helped complete Lightning's character and enable her to grow as a person. <b>Hope</b> is voiced by Vincent Martella in English and Yūki Kaji in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>Hope</b> was a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that <b>Hope</b> was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on <b>hope</b> alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, <b>Hope</b> has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of <b>hope</b> but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in <b>hope,</b> became popular with other theologians.|$|E
5|$|Good <b>Hope,</b> {{named after}} the British colony on the Cape of Good <b>Hope,</b> was laid down on 11 September 1899 {{with the name of}} Africa by Fairfield Shipbuilding & Engineering at their Govan shipyard. She was renamed Good <b>Hope</b> on 2 October and {{launched}} on 21 February 1901. She arrived in Portsmouth to be completed and armed in late December 1901. In 1906 she became the flagship of the 1st Cruiser Squadron, Atlantic Fleet and was the flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron when she visited South Africa two years later. Good <b>Hope</b> was placed in reserve in 1913.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hope</b> {{continued}} {{in command of}} small ships for several years, pausing in 1792 to marry his distant cousin, Lady Anne <b>Hope</b> Johnstone. The couple would have two daughters and four sons before Anne's death in 1818. In 1794, <b>Hope</b> was in command of HMS Incendiary, a fireship of the Channel Fleet attached to Lord Howe's force sent to engage the French. In March, <b>Hope</b> was given his step to post captain, taking command of the ship of the line HMS Bellerophon, the flagship of Admiral Thomas Pasley.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hope</b> {{is closely}} related to Idle Child of Fancy, {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification of one of the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of the virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while <b>Hope</b> was not; in <b>Hope</b> and Idle Child Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love looking straight ahead and <b>Hope</b> as blind. It {{is believed to be the}} first time a European artist depicted <b>Hope</b> as blind.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hope,</b> Powell, and Monk were {{considered}} by their contemporaries to be influences {{on each other}} early in their careers, and all, therefore, helped affect the development of jazz piano. Powell was known for horn-like right-hand playing supported by simple left-hand chords, which was something he had worked on with <b>Hope.</b> Later pianists who have cited <b>Hope</b> as a major influence include Lafayette Gilchrist, Alexander Hawkins, Frank Hewitt, and Hasaan Ibn Ali. Hawkins said in 2013 that <b>Hope</b> was important {{because he had a}} highly individual style but does not have the iconic status of pianists such as Monk. Modern jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel has mentioned Hope's rhythms, phrasing, and compositions as influences.|$|E
5|$|In 1786, Hope's career {{suffered}} a blow {{when he was}} stationed aboard the frigate HMS Pegasus, commanded by Prince William Henry. <b>Hope</b> and Prince William fell out badly and {{in less than a}} year <b>Hope</b> had been transferred to the frigate HMS Boreas, at that time commanded by Captain Horatio Nelson, with whom <b>Hope</b> had good relations. Two years later, <b>Hope</b> was transferred to HMS Adamant at the request of Sir Richard Hughes.

He is instrumental in keeping the world going, for as Lightning completes quests and fulfills missions, he uses energy generated from those acts to prolong the world's life.

5|$|This {{interest}} {{had expanded}} by June 1953, when <b>Hope</b> recorded in New York {{as part of}} a quintet led by trumpeter Clifford Brown and alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson. Critic Marc Myers suggested that the six songs the band recorded were the first in a new form of jazz, 'hard bop', that became highly influential. That 1953 session also helped <b>Hope</b> gain exposure with Blue Note Records' producer Alfred Lion, who supervised his debut recording as a leader around a week later. This resulted in the 10-inch album Elmo <b>Hope</b> Trio, which had Morris alumni Percy Heath on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums. The tracks recorded illustrated, in critic Kenny Mathieson's view, that <b>Hope</b> was interested in the architecture and aural detail of the music more than in individual virtuosity. A further Blue Note recording session 11 months later led to Elmo <b>Hope</b> Quintet, Volume 2.|$|E
5|$|Unable to earn {{a living}} in New York because of the {{performance}} ban, <b>Hope</b> toured with trumpeter Chet Baker in 1957 and then began living in Los Angeles. He soon found other musicians who had been influenced by bebop, including saxophonist Harold Land and bassist Curtis Counce. <b>Hope</b> played with Rollins again, and, in October 1957, recorded another album, The Elmo <b>Hope</b> Quintet Featuring Harold Land. In March of the following year <b>Hope</b> became part of Counce's band, and went on to record two albums with the bassist. <b>Hope</b> also did some arranging for others around this time, including for Land's 1958 Harold in the Land of Jazz. <b>Hope</b> also had his own band, with personnel that varied, and in 1959 he played with Lionel Hampton in Hollywood. Later that year, after performances in San Francisco with two quartets – the first containing Rollins, bassist Scott LaFaro, and drummer Lenny McBrowne; the other with Rollins replaced by Land – <b>Hope</b> travelled north with the Land group to play at a venue in Vancouver.|$|E
