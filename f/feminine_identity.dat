40|$|We {{explore the}} {{construction}} of <b>feminine</b> <b>identities</b> among women maquila workers in Jua�rez, Mexico. The findings suggest that women workers' identities are fluid processes in permanent negotiation. Women's changing employment practices, gender roles and relations, and personal experiences have created spaces for new interpretations of courtship and motherhood. As Mexican women increasingly face controversial messages, they reconcile emerging and conventional feminine discourses by recreating images of Mexican womanhood. ...|$|R
2500|$|Various ex-gay {{organizations}} have working definitions of change. Prior to disbanding and renouncing {{the idea of}} a cure, Exodus International described change as, [...] "attaining abstinence from homosexual behaviors, lessening of homosexual temptations, strengthening their sense of masculine or <b>feminine</b> <b>identity,</b> correcting distorted styles of relating with members of the same and opposite gender." [...] People Can Change defines change as, [...] "any degree of change toward greater peace, satisfaction and fulfillment, and less shame, depression and darkness", and emphasizes that for most people, heterosexuality is not the ultimate goal. When the term ex-gay was introduced to professional literature in 1980, E. Mansell Pattison defined it as describing a person who had [...] "experienced a basic change in sexual orientation". Some ex-gays advocate entering (or remaining) in a heterosexual marriage as part of the process. Some in mixed-orientation marriages acknowledge that their sexual attractions remain primarily homosexual, but seek to make their marriages work anyway.|$|E

40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis examines {{the ways in which}} female bodies are central to the production and reproduction of gendered social inequality, and the formation of <b>feminine</b> <b>identities</b> in the fitness gym. Ethnographic methods were utilised to investigate the patterns and relations of power that underpinned the production and reproduction of feminine body ideals and <b>feminine</b> <b>identities</b> and habituses in a fitness gym in the South-East of England. The potential usefulness of harnessing feminist and figurational concepts for understanding gendered bodies in the context of sport and exercise is also explored. Some of the theoretical and methodological links between feminist and figurational perspectives are explored in this thesis. A feminist-figurational approach is presented as a useful way of understanding the complexities of female body image and feminine identification in the fitness gym. Central in this regard has been an examination of the unequal relationships between, and within, groups of people in exercise and fitness settings. The task of producing a relatively high degree of adequate knowledge about gendered bodies in the fitness gym has also involved consideration of several concepts related to Elias's (1978, 1987) theory of involvement and detachment including: the personal pronoun model, the use of developmental thinking, the interplay between theory and evidence and the adequacy of evidence. Feminist and figurational ideas about gender, power and identities have been of use in making sense of the relationships between workingout, female bodies and femininities. Elias's conceptualisations of power, establishedoutsider relations and identification have been particularly helpful. Evidence from participant observations and interviewing revealed that several mechanisms serve to reinforce, challenge and negotiate a variety of images of the female body-beautiful in the fitness gym. These include: the insecurity and emotion that surround the acquisition and maintenance of an ideal physique, the monopolisation of corporeal power, the construction of group charisma and group disgrace, the formation of gossip networks, and the corporeal logic of the 'exercise body-beautiful complex'. The findings also reveal that female bodies are central to the formation of <b>feminine</b> <b>identities</b> and habituses. <b>Feminine</b> <b>identities</b> are founded on both different and shared characteristics of the female body-beautiful. Some female exercisers also share some characteristics with other women, specifically {{in the context of the}} fitness gym. Linked to a desire for a high status body Image, there is a tendency for white, western, middle-class, heterosexual, able-bodied women, who go to the gym, to share a preference for cosmetic fitness activities, and an emotional tie to aspirations for a slender, muscularly toned physique. The exercise histories of the women in this study indicated that the inculcation of feminine conduct and bodily preference happens over time, and in relation to a range of corporeal experiences including: physical education, sport, exercise, dance, dieting and adolescence...|$|R

40|$|Because masculinities and femininities are {{socially}} and culturally constructed, they often play significant roles in constructing identities and distinguishing one another. Femininities and masculinities therefore {{play a key}} role in nation-building and in the sustenance of national identities. In this article I explore, through the autobiographies of two luminaries of Zimbabwe’s liberation war, how individual politicians configure their own gender identities and consequently the masculine and <b>feminine</b> <b>identities</b> of others. I posit that the autobiographical mode allows for intimate gendering of the liberation discourse. I also argue that Tekere celebrates the heroic masculine self, preferring military femininities to domestic ones. He privileges his own masculinity while “feminising” Robert Mugabe. Chung debunks the perceived manliness of political struggle and its representations by hailing the participation of women in the struggle for liberation. Her narration of their femininity is in relation to the nation and is structured around the struggle for national liberation, female emancipation and nation-building. Typical of female life-writing, Chung exhibits a relational sense of identity in which the autonomous self is subordinate to or subsumed in the collective. Hers becomes a projection and celebration of heroic femininities. I conclude this article by asserting that masculine and <b>feminine</b> <b>identities</b> in Zimbabwe’s political discourse remain bound up with the historical processes of colonial and nationalist liberation struggles.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of feminine {{writing on the}} Francophone African literary scene presents new multiplicities of fictional representations of women. These representations usher new insights {{to our understanding of}} femininity. This study examines women representations in Véronique Tadjo’s Le royaume aveugle (1991) and Loin de mon père (2010), to investigate how different narrative styles from a single writer can express idiosyncratic <b>feminine</b> <b>identities.</b> The present research aims at examining whether Tadjo highlights feminist ideals in Le royaume aveugle and Loin de mon père and if so, how this is achieved. The study employs African feminist literary criticism to critically analyse the various literary feminine representations in the two texts. The thesis is divided into two main parts – the first one which focuses on feminine representations in Le royaume aveugle and the second one which looks at Loin de mon père. The study concludes that although the author employs different narrative styles in her novelistic writing of both texts, it all results in rich literary <b>feminine</b> <b>identities.</b> Also, it becomes evident that various feminist aspects are present in both novels. Secondly, the study concludes that in her portraits of women, Tadjo, unlike early African feminist writers, does not seek to necessarily relegate men to inferior positions but, rather, she proposes that men and women are equal partners in fighting not only feminine oppression, but also many other forms of inequalities which stem from socio-political problems in the images she depicts...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the sport}} of female {{bodybuilding}} was organized, gender discrimination has been an issue. People recognize {{that part of the}} <b>feminine</b> <b>identity</b> is sculpting their physical appearances and they usually associate the common <b>feminine</b> <b>identity</b> with slenderness and a trim figure. In Studies in Popular Culture A.J. Randall and colleagues describes this {{as the result of the}} patriarchal society which emphasizes that femininity is created by altering the body for society's gendered expectations [...] When women venture away from the gender expectations, society's view of their femininity begins to slip. Female bodybuilders experience this criticism of their body, as they build bodies which are commonly associated with the masculine identity. [...] Despite this there is a very dedicated female bodybuilding fan base.|$|E

This approach will allow us to study how <b>feminine</b> <b>identities</b> were historically constituted and how roles, functions and power relationships legitimized gendered distinctions based on biological differences. These differences naturalized the centrality of motherhood in terms of reproductive function in the lives of women and even when based on these binary gender constructs they considered limiting the scope of maternal roles but not the paternal ones. </p...|$|R

50|$|Kathoey is {{the term}} used by {{both males and females}} that allows them to be {{alongside}} the normative masculine and <b>feminine</b> <b>identities.</b> Up until the 1970s hermaphrodites and cross-dressing men and women could all come under the term kathoey, however the term has been dropped for the cross-dressing masculine females who are now referred to as tom. As a result of the shifts, kathoey today is most commonly understood as a male transgender category. Kathoey is derived from the Buddhist myth that describes three original human sex/genders, male, female, and a biological hermaphrodite or kathoey. Kathoey is not defined as merely being a variant between male or female but as an independently existing third sex.|$|R
