In the video published by News of the World, Majeed told the undercover reporters that two Pakistani bowlers (Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir) would deliberately deliver no balls at specific points during the match. Majeed stated on the video that Amir would be Pakistan's bowler for the third over, and that the first ball of the over would be a no-ball delivery. Amir did bowl the third over, and on his first delivery from the over, bowled a no-ball delivery. Commentary described the delivery as a [...] "massive overstep", a good half-foot beyond the <b>delivery</b> <b>line.</b> Majeed also predicted that the sixth delivery of the tenth over would be a no-ball, and the ball, delivered by Asif, was also a no-ball delivery.|$|E
50|$|During the {{suction stroke}} of the {{delivery}} piston the medium is sucked in via the open suction ball valve. At {{the same time}} the ball valve on the <b>delivery</b> <b>line</b> is pushed into the valve seating by the underpressure resulting from the suction (automatic valves). In parallel with this, the second delivery piston is making the pressure stroke and forces the medium through the discharge ball valve and into the <b>delivery</b> <b>line.</b> The suction ball valve is pushed into its seating by the <b>delivery</b> <b>line</b> pressure and thereby closes off the connection to pump intake.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{element of}} the transfer tube pump is the so-called [...] "S" [...] transfer tube installed inside the feed hopper. The job of the transfer tube is to control the flow of high-density solids - in other words, the pump cylinder which is currently pushing the material {{is connected to the}} <b>delivery</b> <b>line</b> by such tube. At (or nearby) the end of each piston stroke the S-shaped tube which is connected to the <b>delivery</b> <b>line</b> is swung over to the other delivery cylinder with the aid of two switch cylinders. A hydraulic circuit is used for synchronizing the position of the transfer tube and the movements of the two delivery pistons.|$|E
50|$|The large {{cross section}} of the holes in the {{spectacle}} plate means that with a delivery cylinder diameter of e.g. 200 mm it is possible to pump high-density solids with a mean grain size of as much as 80 mm. The maximum diameter of individual foreign bodies may be as high as 60% of the diameter of the <b>delivery</b> <b>line</b> - in this example this would be 120 mm.|$|E

5000|$|The {{steel housing}} {{of the seat}} valve pump {{contains}} four hydraulically controlled seat valves, two suction and two delivery valves for the two hydraulic cylinders. The suction and discharge valves are synchronized with the hydraulics of the delivery pistons - this ensures that {{the contents of the}} delivery cylinder is equal at all times to the volume being pumped. Once the [...] "sucking" [...] piston reaches its end position, the corresponding suction or delivery valve is simultaneously closed or opened. If there is overpressure in the <b>delivery</b> <b>line,</b> the suction valve will close first. This prevents the pumped medium from being pushed out of the pressure line back into the hopper.|$|E
50|$|The single-cylinder pump is {{suitable}} for bulk materials with an awkward coarse composition - for example wood chips, organic waste, hazardous waste, or shredded paper. If such unsaturated material is to be conveyed over large distances, one possible approach is the hybrid feed system. Here compressed air is injected into the <b>delivery</b> <b>line.</b> It presses the plug of material into the pipe. As the compressed air expands the material being conveyed is loosened and separated. As distance increases from the air injection point, what was initially a series of plugs gradually turns into a continuous airborne stream. The amount of air required and the appropriate pipe diameter depend on the type and quantity of matter being conveyed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{higher the}} {{volatility}} of the fuel, {{the more likely it}} is that vapor lock will occur. Historically, gasoline was a more volatile distillate than it is now and was more prone to vapor lock. Conversely, diesel fuel is far less volatile than gasoline, so that diesel engines almost never suffer from vapor lock. However, diesel engine fuel systems are far more susceptible to air locks in their fuel lines, because standard diesel fuel injection pumps rely on the fuel being non-compressible. Air locks are caused by air leaking into the fuel <b>delivery</b> <b>line</b> or entering from the tank. Air locks are eliminated by turning the engine over for a time using the starter motor, or by bleeding the fuel system.|$|E
40|$|In Australian industry, {{centralised}} lubrication systems {{are used to}} deliver grease to various mechanical components, usually bearings. In many situations, {{the length of the}} <b>delivery</b> <b>lines</b> is in excess of 20 metres. These lines meander through other pieces of equipment and infrastructure. In some situations when these lines are attached to support devices that are subject to vibration, the delivery pipes have become âpluggedâ because the oil in the grease has leaked/separated from the grease matrix. This scenario is very costly to the owner/operator of the equipment as a lack of lubrication can cause major repair/maintenance costs. A laboratory test procedure has been devised to evaluate the suitability of various greases to remain stable under these conditions...|$|R

5000|$|With a single-cylinder {{piston pump}} the medium is [...] "stuffed" [...] {{out of a}} feed chute into the {{delivery}} cylinder and by the cylinder into the <b>delivery</b> <b>line</b> on the forward stroke. Depending {{on the level of}} the delivery pressure in the pipe and on the flow properties of the medium, the delivery flange of the pump will be fitted with a flat slide valve or a lamellar non-return valve in order to prevent flowback of the material on the return stroke. Which delivery piston is actually selected will depend on the material which is to be pumped: Free flowing media call for perturbane sealing elements while bulky materials which have to be chopped up during pumping mean that hardened cutting edges are required.|$|E

A tent camp was built for 1,500 men and 300 officers. Due to a shortage of cement it was decided to use PSP on the seaplane ramps and apron. A temporary PSP seaplane ramp, 25 ft wide, was completed by May 1943. At the end of June, another temporary PSP ramp was built for use by a second PBY squadron operating from the base. Construction of a 12,000-barrel tank farm including a filling line to the beach and a <b>delivery</b> <b>line</b> to the ramp was also completed together with 30 wooden buildings for administration and workshops. The PSP ramps were considered wholly satisfactory in service, and it was estimated that their substitution for concrete saved approximately two months' construction time.|$|E

In batch plants, the fibre additive is added direct to the pugmill using individually wrapped press packs or bulk dispensing equipment. Mixing times may be extended ensure that fibre is homogeneously distributed throughout the mix and temperatures controlled in order to avoid overheating or damage to the fibre. In drum plants, particular care must be taken to ensure that both the additional filler content and fibre additive are incorporated into the mixture without excessive losses through the dust extraction system. Filler systems that add filler directly into the drum rather than aggregate feed are preferred. Pelletised fibres may be added through systems designed for addition of recycled materials, but a more effective means is addition through a special <b>delivery</b> <b>line</b> that is combined with the bitumen delivery, so that the fibre is captured by bitumen at the point of addition to the mixture.|$|E

5000|$|A wet single-point nitrous system {{introduces}} the fuel and nitrous together, causing the upper intake manifold to become wet with fuel.

However, most makes of nitrous systems combined with unsuitable intake designs, often result in distribution problems and/or intake backfires. Dry-flow intakes are designed to contain only air, which will travel through smaller pipes and tighter turns with less pressure, whereas wet-flow intakes are designed to contain a mixture of fuel and air.
