5000|$|In 1846 Louis-Nicolas Ménard and Florès Domonte {{discovered}} that cellulose nitrate could be dissolved in ether. [...] They devised {{a mixture of}} ether (ethoxyethane) as the solvent and ethanol as a diluent that rendered cellulose nitrate into a clear <b>gelatinous</b> <b>liquid.</b> Collodion was first used medically as a dressing in 1847 by the Boston physician John Parker Maynard. The solution was dubbed [...] "collodion" [...] (from the Greek κολλώδης (kollodis), gluey) by Dr. A.A. Gould of Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E
5000|$|The drying completed, the old papermakers dipped {{their paper}} into an animal size {{that had been}} made from the parings of hides, which they {{procured}} from the parchment-makers. It was necessary to size that paper so that it would be impervious to ink, but sizing was more needed in writing than in printing papers. Many books of the fifteenth century were printed upon paper that had not been sized, this extra treatment not being essential for a type impression. The sizing was accomplished by a worker holding a number of sheets by the aid of two wooden sticks, and dipping the paper into the warm <b>gelatinous</b> <b>liquid.</b> The sheets were then pressed to extract the superfluous gelatine. This crude method of sizing the paper was extremely wasteful as many sheets were torn and bruised beyond use. The sizing room of the early paper mills, was, for this reason, known as the ‘slaughter-house’.|$|E
50|$|Teenage boy Zack {{lives on}} a farm in Tellico Plains, Tennessee with his mother Frances, younger sister Alice, stern and pious {{stepfather}} Nathan Crane and unpleasant, dim-witted stepbrother Cyrus. One night Frances sneaks out of the house while Nathan is asleep and begins having sex with Mike, a farm-hand who lives in a nearby shack. Suddenly a large meteorite crashes onto the property, emitting an eerie glow. Next morning, Alan Forbes, a physician who lives nearby, visits the crash-site, examining the meteorite which is a large sphere with a hard shell from which a noxious liquid oozes out. Before long, the object dissolves into glowing <b>gelatinous</b> <b>liquid</b> which seeps into the soil. Forbes wants to contact the authorities but is dissuaded by Charlie Davidson, local realtor and head of the chamber of commerce, who worries that the event will discourage the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from building a new reservoir in the area. Forbes' bored wife Esther also manipulates her husband into keeping quiet, worried their house will lose its value.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{flywheel}} systems require strong containment vessels as {{a safety}} precaution, which increases the total mass of the device. The energy release from failure can be dampened with a <b>gelatinous</b> or encapsulated <b>liquid</b> inner housing lining, which will boil and absorb the energy of destruction. Still, many customers of large-scale flywheel energy-storage systems prefer to have them embedded in the ground to halt any material that might escape the containment vessel.|$|R
40|$|Amylomyces rouxii {{is one of}} {{the main}} fungi usually coexisting with yeasts in Chinese yeast ball, the starter of chiu-niang, a {{traditional}} Chinese fermented product from rice. In the present study, growth and production of milk-clotting enzyme (MCE) in <b>gelatinous</b> rice <b>liquid</b> culture of A. rouxii as influenced by waxy (gelatinous) rice content in the medium (5 – 20 %), temperature (25 – 40 °C), cultivation time (1 – 6 days), shaking speeds (0 – 150 rpm) and metal ions (Na+, K+, Zn 2 +, Mg 2 +, Mn 2 +, Cu 2 +, Ca 2 +, Fe 3 + and Al 3 +) were investigated. Results revealed that rice content in the medium, shaking speed, temperature and cultivation time all affected the mycelial propagation and the production of milk-clotting enzyme by A. rouxii in the rice liquid culture. The maximum milk-clotting enzyme activity of ca. 1. 22 unit/mL of medium was observed in the 3 -day static culture of test organism grown at 30 °C in the medium containing 20 % of gelatinous rice, while mycelial propagation increased with the increase of cultivation time and shaking speed. Furthermore, a significant increase (p< 0. 05) in the milk-clotting enzyme activity of ca. 1. 90 unit/mL of medium, which was about 1. 55 -fold of the control, was observed when Al 3 + was added to the rice liquid medium...|$|R
5000|$|In The Invasion, {{the invaders}} are changed from pods to an alien virus that is {{contracted}} through liquids. Once the person falls asleep, the virus rewrites human DNA. The aliens then vomit a <b>gelatinous</b> substance into <b>liquids</b> {{to help the}} invasion continue. When the invasion gains considerable strength, the pod people transform humans by directly injecting them with the substance, {{under the guise of}} [...] "influenza vaccines". As it continues across the globe, entire world conflicts are resolved, including the Iraq War and Darfur. However, it is discovered that people who had certain illnesses during childhood were completely immune to the virus. A vaccine is created and the entire pandemic is cured within a year; those infected, after being treated, are unable to remember events during their infection, [...] "as though they were in a deep sleep". Similar to previous incarnations, the virus can kill its human host. This is hinted at when Carol takes a picture of a human being converted and sends him into cardiac arrest. It is actually evidenced during Carol and Gene's exchange on the commuter train: ...|$|R
