Across the street was a housing project, and he observed suburban teenagers going into the project and obtaining heroin from a dealer known as [...] "Captain Jack". [...] "It's about {{coming out of the}} New York suburbs," [...] Joel told John Kalodner in 1974. [...] "But in my travels I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the same suburb all over the country.

The equipment was sent to forces in the country, presented by former Test player Mike Gatting. In April 2007 Wisden writer Tony Munroe covered the efforts of Major Andrew Banks, who toured schools in Iraq with a detachment of the Royal Air Force handing out cricket equipment and explaining the laws of cricket to teachers. He recorded that [...] "after some simple explanation of the basic rules of cricket (through an interpreter) and a quick demonstration by members of the RAF, the Iraqi children joyfully hit the ball around the playground. I duly handed over the set to the games mistress and she in turn professed to be keen to allow her charges to play on a regular basis." [...] He noted that [...] "The teachers <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of projects come out of the West so they were sceptical until they saw the kids having fun" [...] and that [...] "They never quite understood the lbw law but they enjoyed themselves and that was what mattered." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2009, Steel {{auditioned for}} the third series of Britain's Got Talent. In her first {{televised}} appearance, she began her number ballet dancing to [...] "I Could Have Danced All Night" [...] from the musical My Fair Lady, then, as judge Simon Cowell started {{to reach for the}} red rejection buzzer, she began singing the song with an unexpectedly powerful voice. She received a standing ovation from the audience and the approval of all four judges. Piers Morgan told Steel, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of children on our show over the past three series and I have never heard any of them sing as well as you do". [...] Kelly Brook was in tears and called her performance, [...] "beautiful and lovely". Media reports at the time claimed that Steel had referred to Cowell as a bully for critical comments he made after her first appearance on the show; however, a blog at a Lancashire newspaper's web site that was attributed to Steel and her mother denied that she had ever made such a comment. Commentators and mainstream media outlets speculated that she might defeat Susan Boyle, who had made an impression worldwide in the first show of the series. [...] Over thirteen million viewers watched Steel's performance and, within one day of a video of her performance being posted on YouTube, over a million viewers had seen her worldwide. She was interviewed on US television via satellite link during NBC's Today show.|$|E
2500|$|Among critics, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times, {{gave the}} film two {{stars in a}} mostly {{negative}} review, saying the film lacked a science fiction theme and was more akin to a police murder revenge flick, musing [...] "they've just taken the standard cop-buddy-drug lord routine and changed some of the makeup. The Newcomers have no surprises." [...] Regarding the fictional alien culture, he expressed disappointment saying [...] "a feeble attempt is made to invest the Newcomers with interest, by having them get drunk on sour milk instead of booze, and depriving them of any sense of humor." [...] However, on a slightly complimentary note, Ebert mentioned [...] "the makeup took trouble, the photography looks good, the cast and technical credits are top-drawer." [...] But overall, he summed it up by declaring [...] "Alien Nation feels like a movie made by people who <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of movies, but don't think the audience has." [...] In agreement with Ebert over the originality of the buddy cop genre with the aliens inserted in as just a new rendition, Rita Kempley of The Washington Post said, [...] "Alien Nation wants to be [...] "In the Heat of the Night" [...] as science fiction, but it's neither morally instructive nor prophetic. It proves a lumbering marriage of action and sci-fi that alienates both audiences. It's too dull for one and too dumb for the other." [...] Kempley did find the first half hour to be suspenseful, though: [...] "... well paced, brawny and intense, {{looks like it was}} made by another director. But the rest is the cinematic equivalent of overcooked asparagus." [...] However, the more enthusiastic staff of Variety found originality in the extraterrestrial–injected plot saying, [...] "Solid performances by leads James Caan and his humanoid buddy-cop partner Mandy Patinkin move this production beyond special effects, clever alien makeup and car chases." [...] while also adding the film was a [...] "compelling human-humanoid drama." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), {{the body}} that {{develops}} Canada's national list of endangered species, assessed Atlantic Cod. COSEWIC's designations in theory are informed by reports it commissions and expert discussion in the panel, and it claims to be scientific and apolitical. Recognising faults in processes is not recreational, but {{an important step in}} their improvement. In this case much was mishandled. One observer opined [...] "this process stinks"; the same observer later joined, and then became Chair of, COSEWIC. COSEWIC listed Atlantic cod as [...] "vulnerable" [...] (this category later renamed [...] "special concern") on a single-unit basis, i.e. assuming a single homogeneous population. The basis (single-unit) of designation and the level (vulnerable) assigned was in contrast to the range of designations including [...] "endangered" [...] for some of the 10 management (sub) units addressed in the report that COSEWIC had commissioned from Dr. K.N.I. Bell. That contradiction between the report and the listing reflected political pressure from the DFO; such bureaucratic pressure had been evident through three years of drafts. The 1998 designation followed on from a deferral in 1997 and bureaucratic tactics including what one COSEWIC insider characterised as [...] "a plan to make it late". Press interest prior to the 1998 meeting had, however, likely deterred a further deferral. COSEWIC's 'single unit' basis of listing was at the behest of DFO, despite that DFO itself had previously in criticism demanded (properly, given the new evidence) that the report address multiple stocks. The author had agreed with that criticism and revised accordingly, but DFO then changed its mind without explanation. By the time of COSEWIC's 1998 cod discussion, the Chair had been ousted for having said [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of status reports ... t is as good as I have ever seen in regards to content", and COSEWIC had already attempted to unilaterally alter the 1998 report. The report remains one of an undeclared number that are illegally suppressed (COSEWIC refuses to officially release it unless it can change it [...] "so that it ... reflects COSEWIC's designation"), in this case despite kudos from eminent reviewers of COSEWIC's own choice. COSEWIC in defense asserted a right to alter the report or that Bell had been asked to provide a report that supported COSEWIC's designation; either defense would involve clear violations of ethics, of COSEWIC's procedures at the time, and of the norms of science. The key tactics used to avert any at-risk listing centered on the issue of stock discreteness, and DFO's single-stock stance within COSEWIC contradicted the multiple-stock hypothesis supported by the most recent science (including DFO's, hence DFO's earlier and proper demand that the report address these). Bell has argued that this contradiction between fact and tactic effectively painted management into a corner from which it could not acknowledge or explain the contrast between areas where conservation measures were clearly needed and areas where opposite observations were gaining press attention. In effect, DFO's opposition to a listing compromised its ability to carry out its conservation mandate.|$|E

I may have given a wrong name to some strong sentiment for him on her part, to an unreasonable and simple attitude a woman is apt to take up emotionally towards a man. She used to abuse him to me frequently, which, of course, is not inconsistent with my idea. Not at all. It looked to me as if she were always thinking of him. He was something important in her life.
