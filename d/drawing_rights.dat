5|$|As part of {{the first}} {{amendment}} to its articles of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new reserve instrument called special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> (SDRs), which could be held by central banks and exchanged among themselves and the Fund as an alternative to gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket's composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions among themselves and the Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket's portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates. Special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold. The Fund initially issued 9.5 billion XDR from 1970 to 1972.|$|E
5|$|For example, in March 2009, as {{a result}} of the late-2000s {{financial}} crisis, the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation pressed for urgent consideration of a new international reserve currency and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development proposed greatly expanding the I.M.F.'s special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights.</b> Conspiracy theorists fear these proposals are a call for the U.S. to adopt a single global currency for a New World Order.|$|E
5|$|In the March 2009 speech {{entitled}} Reform the International Monetary System, Zhou Xiaochuan, {{the governor}} of the People's Bank of China, came out in favour of Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency. Zhou argued that it was unfortunate that {{part of the reason for}} the Bretton Woods system breaking down was the failure to adopt Keynes's bancor. Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> (SDRs).|$|E

25|$|Meeting in December 1971 at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., the Group of Ten {{signed the}} Smithsonian Agreement. The US pledged to peg the dollar at $38/ounce with 2.25% trading bands, and other {{countries}} agreed to appreciate their currencies versus the dollar. The group also planned to balance the world financial system using special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> alone.|$|E
25|$|Following the Internationalization of the renminbi, on 30 November 2015, the IMF {{voted to}} {{designate}} the renminbi {{as one of}} several main world currencies, thus including it in the basket of special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights.</b> The RMB became the first emerging market currency {{to be included in}} the IMF’s SDR basket on 1 October 2016. The other main world currencies are the United States dollar, euro, British pound, and Japanese yen.|$|E
25|$|In December 1980, the dinar {{was officially}} pegged to the IMF's special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> (SDRs). In practice, it is fixed at $1 USD = 0.376 BD, which {{translates}} to approximately 1 BD = $2.65957 USD and, consequently, almost 10 Saudi Arabian riyals. This rate was made official in 2001 and Saudi riyals are accepted in Bahrain {{at any point}} of sale, {{with the exception of}} the Saudi 500 riyal note which is only accepted in major supermarkets, airports and electronic shops.|$|E

25|$|Voting {{power in}} the IMF {{is based on a}} quota system.

The Special <b>Drawing</b> <b>Right</b> is the unit of account of the IMF and represents a claim to currency. It is based on a basket of key international currencies. The basic votes generate a slight bias in favour of small countries, but the additional votes determined by SDR outweigh this bias. Changes in the voting shares require approval by a supermajority of 85% of voting power.|$|R

25|$|IMF {{policies}} have been repeatedly criticised for {{making it difficult for}} indebted countries to say no to environmentally harmful projects that nevertheless generate revenues such as oil, coal, and forest-destroying lumber and agriculture projects. Ecuador for example had to defy IMF advice repeatedly to pursue the protection of its rainforests, though paradoxically this need was cited in IMF argument to support that country. The IMF acknowledged this paradox in the 2010 report that proposed the IMF Green Fund, a mechanism to issue special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> directly to pay for climate harm prevention and potentially other ecological protection as pursued generally by other environmental finance.|$|E
25|$|The special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> (SDR) {{valuation}} is an IMF {{basket of}} currencies, including the Japanese yen. The SDR {{is linked to}} a basket of currencies with 41.9% for the U.S. dollar, 37.4% for the euro, 11.3% for the pound sterling, and 9.4% for the yen (as of 2011). The percentage for the yen has, however, declined from 18% in 2000. The exchange rate for the Japanese yen is {{expressed in terms of}} currency units per U.S. dollar; other rates are expressed as U.S. dollars per currency unit. The SDR currency value is calculated daily and the valuation basket is reviewed and adjusted every five years. The SDR was created in 1969, to support the fixed exchange system.|$|E
25|$|By 1968, {{the attempt}} to defend the dollar at a fixed peg of $35/ounce, {{the policy of the}} Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, had become {{increasingly}} untenable. Gold outflows from the U.S. accelerated, and despite gaining assurances from Germany and other nations to hold gold, the unbalanced fiscal spending of the Johnson administration had transformed the dollar shortage of the 1940s and 1950s into a dollar glut by the 1960s. In 1967, the IMF agreed in Rio de Janeiro to replace the tranche division set up in 1946. Special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> (SDRs) were set as equal to one U.S. dollar, but were not usable for transactions other than between banks and the IMF. Nations were required to accept holding SDRs equal to three times their allotment, and interest would be charged, or credited, to each nation based on their SDR holding. The original interest rate was 1.5%.|$|E

25|$|A renewed {{interest}} in Keynesian ideas {{was not limited to}} Western countries and stimulus plans were a common response to the crisis from nations across the globe. Stimulus packages in Asia were on a par with those in Europe and America. In a speech delivered in March 2009 entitled Reform the International Monetary System, Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, revived Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency. Dr Zhou argued that it was unfortunate that Keynes's bancor proposal was not accepted at Bretton Woods in the 1940s. He argued that national currencies were unsuitable for use as global reserve currencies {{as a result of the}} Triffin dilemma – the difficulty faced by reserve currency issuers in trying to simultaneously achieve their domestic monetary policy goals and meet other countries' demand for reserve currency. Zhou proposed a gradual move towards adopting IMF special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> (SDRs) as a centrally managed global reserve currency.|$|E
25|$|The Santiago Conference, 15 April 1972, was {{the third}} {{occasion}} on which the developing countries have confronted the rich {{with the need to}} use trade and aid measures more effectively to improve living standards in the developing world. Discussion centred on the international monetary system and specifically on the South's proposal that a higher proportion of new special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> (SDRs) should be allocated to LDCs as a form of aid (the so-called 'link'). In Santiago, substantial disagreements arose within the Group of 77 (G77) despite preconference meetings. There was disagreement over the SDR proposal and between those in the G77 who wanted fundamental changes such as a change in the voting allocations in the South's favour at the IMF and those (mainly the Latin American countries) who wanted much milder reforms. This internal dissent seriously weakened the group's negotiating position and led to a final agreed motion which recommended that the IMF should examine the link and that further research be conducted into general reforms. This avoided firm commitments to act on the 'link' or general reform, and the motion was passed by conference.|$|E
25|$|Over 1,000 economists (including Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, Jeffrey Sachs and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz), {{more than}} 1,000 parliamentarians from over 30 countries, the world's major labor leaders, the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and for Citizens' Action, Occupy Wall Street protesters, Oxfam, War on Want {{and other major}} {{development}} groups, the World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace and other major environmental organizations support a FTT. Other notable supporters include the Archbishop of Canterbury, Bill Gates and Michael Moore. David Harding, founder and CEO of one of London's biggest hedge funds has given qualified support for a European tax on financial transactions, breaking ranks with many of his peers fiercely opposed to such a measure. Speculator George Soros, put forward a different proposal, calling rich countries to donate their special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> {{for the purpose of}} providing international assistance, without necessarily dismissing the Tobin tax idea. It has been widely reported that the Pope backs such a tax. However, the reality is that a commission of the Vatican of which the Pope is not a member merely said that such a tax would be worth reflecting on.|$|E
