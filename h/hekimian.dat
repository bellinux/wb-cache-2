For example, a value of a professional athlete’s service is often determined by how much money a particular team, acting in an open competitive market, is willing to pay him or her.|$|E

50|$|According to {{researcher}} Kim <b>Hekimian,</b> {{the majority}} of Armenians arriving in the 1920s originated from the province of Adana in Cilicia of the Ottoman Empire. Most of these Armenians left their homelands either because of the deportations and massacres of the Armenian genocide. Immigrants from the cities of Marash, Hadjin, and Antep together accounted for approximately 60 percents of all incoming Cilician Armenians. The large number of immigrants from these cities {{was a result of}} Armenians following their friends and relatives who had emigrated earlier.|$|E

Knowing the opportunity that presented him, Fashawn dropped out of school and pursued his dream. From 2007 to 2008, he established his presence throughout the Central California hip-hop scene, working with manager Aren <b>Hekimian</b> and releasing multiple mixtapes, including: The Phenom, Grizzly City 2, The Phenom 2, Higher Learning, and One Shot One Kill, which was released by Orisue Clothing.

Although considerable progress has been achieved in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, the live-saving effectofmammography has hardly been measurable and the benefit of taxanes regarded as highly active is still a matter of debate, possibly because treatment effects have hitherto been mainly determined from the solid part of the tumor, {{due to lack of}} measurability of the systemic part of the disease. Here, we have quantified the influence on the systemic disease, cells mobilized from the solid tumor. Increased numbers of circulating epithelial cells were observed in screened individuals and still higher numbers in breast cancer patients with repeated mammograms as compared to mammogram naïve individuals. Taxanes as part of the subsequent systemic treatment led to mobilization of tumor suspect cells in up to 78 % cases and the majority of relapses have occurred in these patients. Surgeryinduced activation of disseminated cells may additionally contribute to metastasis formation. 1...|$|E
