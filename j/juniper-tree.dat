60|$|By {{the time}} the cat {{got out of the}} <b>juniper-tree,</b> Peter and Miss Fuzzytail were sitting side by side safe {{in the middle of a}} bull-briar patch.|$|E
60|$|Somehow Peter knew {{whose voice}} that was, {{although}} {{he never had}} heard it before. He sprang around the little <b>juniper-tree,</b> and what he saw filled him with such rage that he didn't once stop to think of himself. There was little Miss Fuzzytail in the clutches of Black Pussy, Farmer Brown's cat, who often stole away from home to hunt in the Old Pasture. Like a flash Peter sprang over Black Pussy, and {{as he did so}} he kicked with all his might. The cat hadn't seen him coming, and the kick knocked her right into the prickly <b>juniper-tree.</b> Of course she lost her grip on little Miss Fuzzytail, who hadn't been hurt so much as frightened.|$|E
60|$|But one day {{followed}} another, and Peter {{seemed no}} nearer {{than ever to}} meeting little Miss Fuzzytail. He was thinking of this one morning and was really growing very down-hearted, as he sat under a friendly bramble-bush, when {{suddenly there was a}} sharp little scream of fright from behind a little <b>juniper-tree.</b>|$|E
60|$|When Peter's {{stomach was}} stuffed full {{he gave a}} great sigh of relief and limped back to the {{friendly}} old bramble-bush to rest. But he couldn't sit still long, for {{he just had to}} find out all about the Old Pasture. So pretty soon he started out to explore. Such a wonderful place as it seemed to Peter! There were clumps of bushes with little open spaces between, just the nicest kind of playgrounds. Then there were funny spreading, prickly <b>juniper-trees,</b> which made the very safest places to crawl out of harm's way and to hide. Everywhere were paths made by cows. Very wonderful they seemed to Peter, who had never seen any like them before. He liked to follow them because they led to all kinds of queer places.|$|R
60|$|Stone {{could see}} ahead and {{on each side}} several hundred yards, and {{presently}} he ascertained that the forest floor was not so level as he had supposed. He had entered a valley or was traversing a wide, gently sloping pass. He went through thickets of juniper, and had to go around clumps of quaking aspen. The pines grew larger and farther apart. Cedars and pinyons had been left behind, and he had met with no silver spruces after leaving camp. Probably that point was {{the height of a}} divide. There were banks of snow in some of the hollows on the north side. Evidently the snow had very recently melted, and it was evident also that the depth of snow through here had been fully ten feet, judging from the mutilation of the <b>juniper-trees</b> where the deer, standing on the hard, frozen crust, had browsed upon the branches.|$|R
60|$|The moon guided {{us on our}} descent, {{which was}} to the south, obliquely into the Yalloong valley. I was very uneasy about the coolies, who were far behind, {{and some of them}} had been frost-bitten in {{crossing}} the Kambachen pass. Still I thought the best thing was to push on, and light large fires at the first juniper we should reach. The change, on passing from off the snow to the dark earth and rock, was so bewildering, that I had great difficulty in picking my way. Suddenly we came on a flat with a small tarn, whose waters gleamed illusively in the pale moonlight: the opposite flanks of the valley were so well reflected on its gloomy surface, that we were at once brought to a stand-still on its banks: it looked like a chasm, and whether to jump across it, or go down it, or along it, was the question, so deceptive was the spectral landscape. Its true nature was, however, soon discovered, and we proceeded round it, descending. Of course there was no path, and after some perplexity amongst rocks and ravines, we reached the upper limit of wood, and halted by some bleached <b>juniper-trees,</b> which were soon converted into blazing fires.|$|R
60|$|The partial {{ascent of}} the mighty Sh√°rr gave an admirable study of the mode in which the granites have been enfolded and enveloped by the later eruptions of trap. Nor less curious, also, was it to remark how, upon this Arabian Alp, {{vegetation}} became more important; increasing, contrary to the general rule, not only in quantity but in size, and changing from the date and the Daum to the strong smelling Ferula, the homely hawthorn, and the tall and balmy <b>juniper-tree.</b> There is game, ibex and leopard, in these mountains; but the traveller, unless a man of leisure, must not expect to shoot or even to sight it.|$|E

When God {{gives to}} his the grant of their desires, he doth it so {{as may be}} best for our advantage; now there are times wherein the giving of grace may be best to our advantage; as, (1.) Just before a temptation comes, then, if it rains grace on thee from heaven, it may be most for thy advantage. This is like God's sending of plenty in Egypt just before the years of famine came. (2.) For God to {{restrain}} that which thou desirest, even till the spirit of prayer is in a manner spent, may be further to inform thee, that though prayer and desires are a duty, and such also to which the promise is made; yet God sees those imperfections in both thy prayers and desires, as would utterly bind his hands, did he not act towards thee merely from motives drawn from his own bowels and compassion, rather than from any deserving that he sees in thy prayers. Christians, even righteous men, are apt to lean too much to their own doings; and God, to wean them from them, ofttimes defers {{to do what they}} by doing expect, even until in doing their spirits are spent, and they as to doing can do no longer. When they that cried for water had cried till their spirits failed, and their tongue clave to the roof of their mouth for thirst; then the Lord did hear, and then the God of Israel did give them their desire. Also when Jonas his soul fainted under the consideration of all the evils that he had brought upon himself; then his prayer came unto God into his holy temple (Jonah 2:7; Isa 41:17,18). The righteous would be too light in asking, and would too much overprize their works, if their God should not sometimes deal in this manner with them. (3.) It is also to the advantage of the righteous, that they be kept and led in that way which will best improve grace already received, and that is, when they spin it out and use it to the utmost; when they do with it as the prophet did with that meal's meat that he ate under the <b>juniper-tree,</b> 'he went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights, even to the mount of God' (1 Kings 19:8). Or when they do as the widow did, spend upon their handful of flour in the barrel, and upon that little oil in the cruse, till God shall send more plenty (1 Kings 17:9-16). The righteous are apt to be like well fed children, too wanton, if God should not appoint them some fasting days. Or they would be apt to cast away fragments, if God should give them every day a new dish. So then God will grant the desires of the righteous in that way which will be most for their advantage. And that is, when they have made the best of the old store (1 Kings 19:4-8). If God should give us two or three harvests in a year, we should incline to feed our horse and hogs with wheat; but being as it is, we learn better to husband the matter.|$|E

60|$|Salem, June 15, 1835.--A {{walk down}} to the Juniper. The shore of the coves strewn with bunches of sea-weed, driven in by recent winds. Eel-grass, rolled and bundled up, and {{entangled}} with it,--large marine vegetables, of an olive-color, with round, slender, snake-like stalks, four or five feet long, and nearly two feet broad: these are the herbage of the deep sea. Shoals of fishes, at a little distance from the shore, discernible by their fins out of water. Among the heaps of sea-weed there were sometimes small pieces of painted wood, bark, and other driftage. On the shore, with pebbles of granite, there were round or oval pieces of brick, which the waves had rolled about till they resembled a natural mineral. Huge stones tossed about, in every variety of confusion, some shagged all over with sea-weed, others only partly covered, others bare. The old ten-gun battery, at the outer angle of the Juniper, very verdant, and besprinkled with white-weed, clover, and buttercups. The <b>juniper-trees</b> are very aged and decayed and moss-grown. The grass about the hospital is rank, being trodden, probably, by nobody but myself. There is a representation of a vessel under sail, cut with a penknife, {{on the corner of the}} house.|$|R
50|$|Calata√±azor is a {{municipality}} {{located in}} the province of Soria, Castile and Le√≥n, Spain. According to the 2010 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 70 inhabitants. The municipality is named after the tiny fortified city on top of a hill. Also situated in the municipality are the hamlets Aldehuela and Abioncillo.Abioncillo used to be abandoned like many forsaken hamlets in Spain, but in the 1980s was turned around by a few dedicated teachers into an educational center.In the valley between Calata√±azor and Abioncillo the 'Battle of Calata√±azor' took place in the year 1002. The valley is still named 'La valle de la sangre' (the valley of blood). Almanzor, the ruler of Muslim Al-Andalus is by some historians said to have died in this battle. There is a statue of him in Calata√±azor.A certain kind of <b>juniper-tree,</b> the Juniperus thurifera (Spanish juniper), grows in a juniper wood in the nature reserve El Sabinar de Calata√±azor. Some of those trees are the biggest to be found on the whole of the Iberic peninsula. Further are to be found an underground river, the Abi√≥n, which comes above ground at the Fuentona de Muriel, a natural heritage site. The fuentona is visited very often, also by advanced cavedivers. The locals call this fuentona, which looks like a lake, El Ojo de la Mar (The eye of the sea). Also (above ground) a cave, 'La Cueva Maja', with 4000-year-old drawings are found in the vicinity of Abioncillo.Both in the center of Abioncillo and Calata√±azor a many centuries old elm is to be found, once, in Celtiberic times an important symbol.The name Calata√±azor comes from the Arab 'Qalat al-Nusur' which can either mean 'Castle of azure' or 'Castle of vultures'.|$|E
