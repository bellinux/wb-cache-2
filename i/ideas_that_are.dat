Some of his unfinished <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> known include a scheme for the gas lighting of cities in the United States, a means for raising sunken ships, a machine gun, a self-oiling shaft bearing, various types of gearshift for steam carriages, a dough-kneading machine and a perpetual baking oven. In one proposal in 1814, as the British Navy threatened Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812, Evans ventured to build a steam-powered frigate, but the scheme didn't get far.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molydeux is a Twitter account {{presented}} as a parody of the game designer Peter Molyneux. Created by game artist Adam Capone in 2009, it posts audacious game design ideas {{in the style of}} Molyneux. The account presents Molyneux as a tragicomic character with unrelenting, creative <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> continually received by an apathetic audience. Over time, the account evolved from a Molyneux-based persona into a list of potential game concepts. A common theme of the tweets is the untapped potential of emotional game experiences. Molyneux came to appreciate the parody, and has since met Capone in person.|$|E

Over dinner, Chris once again acts so optimistic while {{discussing}} the break-up that Ann thinks their relationship is back on and tries to kiss him, severely embarrassing her. Meanwhile, the camping trip proves unsuccessful and everybody decides to go home that night, but they are left without transportation because Tom and Ben have hooked all of their electronics to the van's battery, draining it. Everybody hikes to a strange bed and breakfast filled with cats and dolls called The Quiet Corn, run by a strict old lady named Elsa Clack (Annie O'Donnell). Andy arrives and rebuilds the romantic tent in the yard for a flattered April. Leslie tells Ron about her mental block, worrying she will never again reproduce an idea better than harvest festival. Ron, recognizing how burnt out she is, solves Leslie's problem by locking her in a bedroom and ordering her to get some sleep. With a rare full night's sleep energizing her, Leslie wakes up with numerous big <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> well received by Chris.|$|E

25|$|One {{component}} of Aristotle's theory of dreams introduces <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> contradictory to previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling {{and that they}} are not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations. These ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams, but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Sternberg & Lubart’s Investment Theory. Using {{the metaphor}} of a stock market, they {{demonstrate}} that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence {{is just one of}} the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.|$|E
25|$|The {{unconscious}} {{was first}} introduced {{in connection with the}} phenomenon of repression, to explain what happens to <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> repressed. Freud stated explicitly that the concept of the unconscious was based on the theory of repression. He postulated a cycle in which ideas are repressed, but remain in the mind, removed from consciousness yet operative, then reappear in consciousness under certain circumstances. The postulate was based upon the investigation of cases of traumatic hysteria, which revealed cases where the behavior of patients could not be explained without reference to ideas or thoughts of which they had no awareness. This fact, combined with the observation that such behavior could be artificially induced by hypnosis, in which ideas were inserted into people's minds, suggested that ideas were operative in the original cases, even though their subjects knew nothing of them.|$|E

25|$|Project Oilsand, {{also known}} as Project Oilsands, was a 1958 {{proposal}} to exploit the Athabasca oil sands using the underground detonation of nuclear explosives; hypothetically, the heat and pressure created by an underground detonation would boil the bitumen deposits, reducing their viscosity {{to the point that}} standard oilfield techniques could be used. The general means by which the plan was to work was discussed in the October 1976 Bulletin of Atomic Scientists issue. A patent was granted for the process that was intended: The Process for Stimulating Petroliferous Subterranean Formations with Contained Nuclear Explosions by Bray, Knutson, and Coffer, which was first submitted in 1964.

The Upanishads are respected {{not because they are}} considered revealed (Shruti), but because they present spiritual <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> inspiring. The Upanishads are treatises on Brahman-knowledge, that is knowledge of Ultimate Hidden Reality, and their presentation of philosophy presumes, [...] "it is by a strictly personal effort that one can reach the truth". In the Upanishads, states Radhakrishnan, knowledge is a means to freedom, and philosophy is the pursuit of wisdom by a way of life.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} mentions of the Osiris myth {{are in the}} Pyramid Texts, {{the first}} Egyptian funerary texts, which appeared {{on the walls of}} burial chambers in pyramids {{at the end of the}} Fifth Dynasty, during the 24th century BCE. These texts, made up of disparate spells or [...] "utterances", contain <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> presumed to date from still earlier times. The texts are concerned with the afterlife of the king buried in the pyramid, so they frequently refer to the Osiris myth, which is deeply involved with kingship and the afterlife. Major elements of the story, such as the death and restoration of Osiris and the strife between Horus and Set, appear in the utterances of the Pyramid Texts.|$|E
500|$|Social Darwinism and {{the concept}} of [...] "human nature" [...] are <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{prevalent}} throughout The Satanic Bible. LaVey describes Satanism as [...] "a religion based on the universal traits of man," [...] and humans are described throughout as inherently carnal and animalistic. Each of the seven deadly sins is described as part of human's natural instinct, and are thus advocated. Social Darwinism is particularly noticeable in The Book of Satan, where LaVey plagiarizes portions of Redbeard's Might Is Right, though it also appears throughout in references to man's inherent strength and instinct for self-preservation. LaVeyan Satanism has been described as [...] "institutionalism of Machiavellian self-interest" [...] because of many of these themes.|$|E
