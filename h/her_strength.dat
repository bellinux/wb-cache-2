Despite the fact that Niki no longer has her powers due to the virus, she agrees to help. They follow a GPS signal emitted by Monica's cell phone and find her in an abandoned warehouse. She is tied up and the warehouse is burning around her. Using what remains of her superhuman strength, Niki manages to help Monica escape, but <b>her</b> <b>strength</b> eventually fails and she ends up trapped inside the building as it explodes.|$|E
5|$|Her {{mother never}} regained <b>her</b> <b>strength</b> after Thomas's birth, {{and for the}} {{remainder}} of her life was a semi-invalid. Ima accompanied her to several health spas during their years in Austin.

Sarah Hogg died in Colorado on September 25, 1895.|$|E
30|$|Freedom. During this {{reviving}} stage, the mentee manages resistance, having {{reached a}} high level of understanding of the potential and dynamics of <b>her</b> <b>strengths.</b> Having a better picture of her strong self, she experiences a sense of fulfilment, personal satisfaction and optimism that her goals can be accomplished by putting <b>her</b> <b>strengths</b> in action. The mentor guides her through the steps of goal setting and action planning, and she realises how she can use and combine <b>her</b> <b>strengths</b> to achieve success. This stage is, in fact, one of personal transformation which enables the mentee to perceive ways in which she can change and respond to challenges in a more positive and effective way, engage and commit to action and identify measurable results she wishes to achieve by using <b>her</b> <b>strengths.</b>|$|R
30|$|Sustainable and optimal use and {{combination}} of strengths. Following the previous stages, the mentee is now putting <b>her</b> <b>strengths</b> into {{use in a}} meaningful and systematic way {{in order to achieve}} her goals. Appropriately using and combining <b>her</b> <b>strengths</b> enables <b>her</b> to anticipate and manage challenges, identify options and their consequences, select the best option for a given situation and context and deliver optimal performance. This stage implies, and requires, that the mentee is flexible and proactive in putting <b>her</b> diverse <b>strengths</b> to the best of use each time while taking caution to avoid overusing them. She is also aware of the value of cooperating with others and combining, or complementing, <b>her</b> own <b>strengths</b> with those of colleagues.|$|R
30|$|Emergence. This stage {{complements}} the preceding ones, being future oriented and core in strengths-based mentoring. It cultivates {{the ground on}} which the mentee will prepare to accept and free <b>her</b> <b>strengths.</b> Apart from asking the mentee to describe experiences in the present or recall past ones in which she used <b>her</b> <b>strengths,</b> the mentor also guides her to think {{of ways in which}} she can use <b>her</b> <b>strengths</b> in the future by encouraging her to see into her goals and expectations, her vision for her life and her business and her aspirations about what she wants to achieve. In this process, she can realise how she can further develop and refine <b>her</b> <b>strengths</b> in order to use them in novel situations and ways and how she can control her weaknesses. This stage could be faced with resistance {{on the part of the}} mentee arising from existing habits, fears, weaknesses and social and cultural perceptions, or from difficulty in realising how the emerging strengths can contribute to the attainment of goals.|$|R
5|$|The 1997 Castlevania Legends for the Game Boy was Alucard's third {{appearance}} in the series. Similar to his initial {{appearance in}} Dracula's Curse, he is a boss challenging {{the skills of the}} game's protagonist, Sonia Belmont. After she defeats him, he accepts <b>her</b> <b>strength</b> and decides to submerge his powers by sleeping, believing that she will defeat Dracula in his stead. Koji Igarashi later removed Castlevania Legends from the official canon of the series, meaning that the plot of the game never occurred in the series' continuity.|$|E
5|$|The queen's foreign contemporaries {{strongly}} condemned her {{policies and}} viewed {{them as the}} actions of a tyrant or even a madwoman, a characterization that persisted in Western historical literature until the 1970s. Although Ranavalona has traditionally been depicted as a cruel and xenophobic tyrant, in more recent historical analyses she is commonly viewed as an astute politician who effectively protected the political and cultural sovereignty of her nation from European encroachment. In Madagascar today, the Malagasy of the central highlands hold complex and diverse views ranging across this spectrum. Most condemn her reign, in line with negative depictions of Ranavalona in current Malagasy history textbooks; this view is most common among Malagasy Christians. Others admire her effort to preserve Malagasy traditions and independence. The majority, regardless of their feelings toward her domestic policies, consider her a remarkable figure in Malagasy history and commend <b>her</b> <b>strength</b> as a ruler in a period of tension with European powers.|$|E
5|$|After Ingrid's {{apparent}} death, {{her soul}} transfers {{back to her}} original body (a mummified corpse) that is protected in a magical sarcophagus hidden in an alternate dimension. It is revealed that Ingrid possesses a form of immortality; she can return her soul to her original body and recover <b>her</b> <b>strength.</b> While locked in her decaying body, she instructs Sebastian to feed her regularly with blood stolen from Mary {{as a form of}} nourishment. When Sebastian seeks advice from Ingrid on how to form a romantic relationship with the newly resurrected Mary, she tells him to use witchcraft; Sebastian refuses to use magic to force Mary to love him. By drinking Mary's blood, Ingrid gains enough power to possess Mary temporarily and starts to have sex with the Devil. However, she is interrupted by Anne, who kills the Devil's human host and sends him back to hell. Anne announces that she plans to carry the Devil's child, and serve as his queen instead of Ingrid. Despite her attempts to reconnect with her daughter, Ingrid is killed by Anne. Restoring Mary's soul back to her body, Anne destroys Ingrid's body and spirit permanently.|$|E
30|$|Evaluation. Evaluation is, in essence, a {{continuous}} and integral process of strengths-based mentoring. The mentor provides constructive strengths-based feedback {{which focuses on}} how the mentee uses <b>her</b> <b>strengths</b> and recommends ways in which she can employ them in similar or novel situations and contexts. Through discussing the mentee’s performance, the mentor facilitates her in evaluating whether she uses <b>her</b> <b>strengths</b> sufficiently each time, and with what results, since overusing them could produce unwanted outcomes or affect future possibilities. This approach creates opportunities for the mentee to further develop <b>her</b> <b>strengths</b> and adopt fresh insights into professional and personal prospects. By providing strengths-based feedback, the mentor further fosters the mentee's engagement and commitment, contributing to higher performance and achievements in her business.|$|R

5|$|Tara finds <b>her</b> <b>strength</b> in Shiv, a wiser {{and more}} {{experienced}} counterpart. The two start {{spending most of}} their spare time together coping with their grief, despite being completely opposite in nature. Shiv takes Tara to the temple, and she takes him shopping. Rajat's doctor, Nirupam Malhotra (Rajat Kapoor), tells Tara that Rajat has a hematoma in his brain and an operation might help him recover, but it carries the risk of partial paralysis. Tara is torn, as she believes Rajat {{would not want to}} take the risk, and seeks advice from Shiv. He is already at loggerheads with Dr. Malhotra, dismissing him as a pawn of the hospital board and the insurance companies who only care about making money and not the patients. Tara and Shiv get into a heated argument. Shiv lashes out angrily at Tara for not giving Rajat a chance at life. Tara retorts that she is a realist, and dismisses Shiv for being selfish and making his wife go through pain for his own sake.|$|E

During a training session with Rogue and Thunderbird, Psylocke was able to match Rogue’s attacks {{despite the fact that}} Rogue had greatly enhanced speed and strength at the time.|$|E

This intervention became somewhat controversial; tiger expert K Ullas Karanth commented that it resulted in Machali living longer than she should have, and that truly wild animals should be born, live and die naturally.|$|E
