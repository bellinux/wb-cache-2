40|$|Following the {{recommendation}} made by Rittenberg (1999), this study encompasses the broader nature of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> that is evolving {{in practice and}} confirmed by the revised definition of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> and the new Professional Practices Framework, both issued by the IIA in 1999. This study, based on six extended case studies, attempts {{to contribute to the}} literature by studying contemporary <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> practices in Belgium (assurance and / or consulting oriented), refining the influence of three predefined variables (reporting relationship, organisational support and internal control system) and determining other important influencing variables. Most <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> activities could be classified as a combination of assurance and consulting services. Moreover, we recognised a limited proportion of pure assurance activities and a sometimes quite extensive proportion of pure consulting activities. On the one hand, a strong administrative reporting relationship with management, a strong organisational support, a weak internal control system and a relatively young <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>department</b> are in most cases associated with relatively higher proportion of consulting oriented activities. On the other hand, a strong functional reporting relationship with the audit committee, a weak organisational support, a strong internal control system and a more mature <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>department</b> are linked with a relatively higher proportion of assurance oriented activities.

In addition, other features, such as the quality of the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> function or the sensitivity of top management to issues relating to corporate internal controls and risk management, can also be taken into account when formulating a judgment on the quality of corporate governance practices.

To define IAD global quality we consider the effectiveness of an <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function analysing its operational aspects. The IAD Index is based on several signalling elements that previous literature assumed as proxies for quality of IADs which are grouped into four pillars: a formal quality index; a static quality index; an activity-related quality index; and a performance-linked quality index.

50|$|While {{internal}} auditors are not {{independent of}} the companies that employ them, independence and objectivity are a cornerstone of the IIA professional standards; and are discussed at length in the standards and the supporting practice guides and practice advisories.

This independence and objectivity are achieved through the organizational placement and reporting lines of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>department.</b> Internal auditors of publicly traded companies in the United States are required to report functionally {{to the board of directors}} directly, or a sub-committee of the board of directors (typically the audit committee), and not to management except for administrative purposes.|$|E
