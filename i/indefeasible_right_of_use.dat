5000|$|<b>Indefeasible</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> (IRU) is a {{permanent}} contractual agreement, that cannot be undone, between the owners of a communications system and a customer of that system. The word [...] "indefeasible" [...] means [...] "not capable of being annulled, or voided, or undone." [...] The customer purchases {{the right to use}} a certain amount of the capacity of the system, for a specified number of years. IRU contracts are almost always long term, commonly lasting 20 to 30 years. The communication system can be a wire cable, such as submarine communications cable, or a fiber optic cable, or a satellite. Depending on the type of system the customer might be buying exclusive use of one, or more, wires in a wire cable, fibers in a fiber optic cable, or channels through a satellite. An IRU owner can unconditionally and exclusively use the relevant capacity of the IRU grantor’s network for the specified time period.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an <b>Indefeasible</b> <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> <b>Use</b> (IRU) as a {{possible}} remedy for telecom infrastructure EU projects that (in Poland) have been lagged behind the time. Thanks for IRU, Beneficiaries of these EU projects will be able to save both: time and money and will finish projects successfully. The author discusses two possible methods of implementing IRU: via regulatory obligation and via incumbent’s goodwill. The author proposes a game theory model with payoffs depending on regulator’s and incumbent’s strategies. Using a game theory tree, the author shows that if only the incumbent is willing to offer his own network, IRU may be signed and most delays in EU projects disappear. The success is not so obvious while implementing IRU as an obligation – in this case EU projects will probably fail. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite their wide {{diffusion}} {{in developed}} countries, broadband services are still limited {{in areas where}} providing them is not profitable for private telecom carriers. To address this, many local governments in Japan have implemented broadband deployment projects subsidized by the national government. In this paper, we discuss local government broadband policies based on survey data collected from municipalities throughout the country. With the support of national promotion policies, broadband services were rapidly introduced to most local municipalities in Japan during the 2000 s. Local government deployment policies helped {{to reduce the number}} of areas with no broadband access. A business model based on the <b>Indefeasible</b> <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> <b>Use</b> (IRU) contract between a private telecom carrier and a local government has been developed in recent years. Even local governments without the technical capacity to operate a broadband business can introduce broadband services into their territory using the IRU business model...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} <b>indefeasible</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> (IRUs) {{against a}} backdrop of the heightened submarine cable construction and upgrade activity currently being undertaken in the transPacific region. In the first part, this paper looks at the ever-increasing consumer demand for capacity and the response by industry that is seeing to the current capacity boom. The second part of this paper discusses IRUs as a means for industry participants to acquire some of the capacity that is becoming available, and some examples of common reasons for acquiring IRUs. As part of that discussion, this paper makes a superficial distinction between IRUs which are acquired because of the specific treatment afforded to them under Australian tax law (referred to in this paper as 2 ̆ 7 Tax IRUs 2 ̆ 7), and IRUs acquired for other reasons (referred to in this paper as 2 ̆ 7 General IRUs 2 ̆ 7). Finally, the third part of this paper considers some of the unique issues which can arise in structuring and negotiating an IRU agreement, whether for a General IRU or a Tax IRU. It is seen that these issues need to be carefully considered and addressed by the parties in order to conclude an IRU agreement that appropriately reflects and facilitates each of their commercial objectives both at the outset and throughout the term...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{political}} philosophers {{have been}} {{fond of the}} word indefeasible when referring to rights, e.g., that were inalienable, divine, or indubitable. For example, in the 1776 Virginia Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> [...] "community hath an indubitable, inalienable, and <b>indefeasible</b> <b>right</b> to reform, alter or abolish government..." [...] (also attributed to James Madison); and John Adams, [...] "The people have a right, an indisputable, unalienable, <b>indefeasible,</b> divine <b>right</b> to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge - I mean of the character and conduct of their rulers."Also, Lord Aberdeen: [...] "indefeasible right inherent in the British Crown" [...] and Gouverneur Morris: [...] "the Basis of our own Constitution is the <b>indefeasible</b> <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> the People." [...] Scholarship about Abraham Lincoln often cites these passages in the justification of secession. Philosophers who use the word defeasible have historically had different world views from those who use the word indefeasible (and this distinction has often been mirrored by Oxford and Cambridge zeitgeist); hence it is rare to find authors who use both words.|$|R

It is not the breaking of his doors and the rummaging of his drawers that constitutes the essence of the offense; but it is the invasion <b>of</b> his <b>indefeasible</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> personal security, personal liberty, and private property, where that right has never been forfeited by his conviction of some public offense, it is the invasion <b>of</b> this sacred <b>right</b> which underlies and constitutes the essence of Lord Camden's judgment.' ...|$|R

For my part, it seems clear that the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> property is anterior to all law, and independent of it. I think that the province of law is not to create property, but to protect it, and that it may, instead of protecting it, become the greatest violator of it. This law providing for the confiscation of property cast in wrecks upon a shore, and its forfeiture to the sovereign of the territory, {{is one of the most}} striking instances of aggression made by law on the natural and <b>indefeasible</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> man.|$|R
6000|$|I {{had set out}} on a journey, with {{no other}} purpose than that of {{exploring}} a certain province of natural knowledge; I strayed no hair's breadth from the course which it was my right and my duty to pursue; and yet I found that, whatever route I took, before long, I came to a tall and formidable-looking fence. Confident as I might be in the existence of an ancient and <b>indefeasible</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> way, before me stood the thorny barrier with its comminatory notice-board--"No Thoroughfare.

True there was no longer any cause to fear the spring guns and man-traps set by former lords of the manor; but one is apt to get very dirty going on all-fours. The only alternatives were either to give up my journey--which I was not minded to do--or to break the fence down and go through it.|$|R

But of late years the free Negro, like the French peasant {{during the first half of}} this century, has held it to be one <b>of</b> the <b>indefeasible</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> a free man to carry a rusty gun, and to shoot every winged thing. [...] He has been tempted, too, by orders from London shops for gaudy birds--humming-birds especially. And when a single house, it is said, advertises for 20,000 bird-skins at a time, no wonder if birds grow scarce; and no wonder, too, if the {{wholesale}} destruction of these insect-killers should avenge itself by a plague of vermin, caterpillars, and grubs innumerable. Already the turf of the Savannah or public park, close by, is being destroyed by hordes of mole-crickets, strange to say, almost exactly like those of our old English meadows; and unless something is done to save the birds, the cane and other crops will surely suffer in their turn. A gun- licence would be, it seems, both unpopular and easily evaded in a wild forest country. A heavy export tax on bird-skins has been proposed. May it soon be laid on, and the vegetable wealth of the island saved, at the expense of a little less useless finery in young ladies' hats.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Somers, when he {{received}} that letter, was much inclined to doubt whether or no {{it might not be}} well to take Owen at his word. After all, what just right had he to the estate? According to the eternal and unalterable laws <b>of</b> <b>right</b> and wrong ought it not to belong to Herbert Fitzgerald? Mr. Somers allowed his wish on this occasion to be father to many thoughts much at variance from that line of thinking which was customary to him as a man of business. In his ordinary moods, law with him was law, and a legal claim a legal claim. Had he been all his life agent to the Hap House property instead of to that of Castle Richmond, a thought so romantic would never have entered his head. He would have scouted a man as nearly a maniac who should suggest to him that his client ought to surrender an undoubted inheritance of twelve thousand a year on a point of feeling. He would have rejected it as a proposed crime, and talked much <b>of</b> the <b>indefeasible</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the coming heirs of the new heir. He would have been as firm as a rock, and as trenchant as a sword in defence of his patron's claims. But now, having in his hands that short, pithy letter from Owen Fitzgerald, he could not but look at the matter in a more Christian light. After all was not justice, immutable justice, better than law? And would not the property be enough for both of them? Might not law and justice make a compromise? Let Owen be the baronet, and take a slice of four or five thousand, and add that to Hap House; and then if these things were well arranged, might not Mr. Somers still be agent to them both? ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} theses {{addresses the}} phenomenon of the unregistered mark for goods and services in accordance with trade mark law of the Czech Republic, while taking into consideration the given scope of EU law and its comparison with the legal protection of applied trade marks in the framework of the "passing-off" doctrine of the legal systems of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. While the subject of trade marks has already been thoroughly established in juristic theory and has also become commonplace in legal practice, the institute of the unregistered trade mark has not yet to be comprehensively examined, and as such it presents significant difficulties in applied practice, as it bears no solid legal foundation, and {{in the context of the}} regulations of trade mark law it is always possible to identify specific special entitlements arising from the existence or application of unregistered trade marks, whereas the nature of their verbal formulations and systematic classification presents difficulties in the interpretation and application of such entitlements. The basis for this reasoning is namely the historical evolution of {{the phenomenon of}} the unregistered mark in trade mark law in Austrian, respectively in subsequent Cisleithania, and its reception and evolvement within Czechoslovak law as the legal predecessor to the Czech Republic. The goal of the research presented herein is to identify answers to the underlying theoretical questions concerning unregistered marks of fundamental significance to applied practice, and in so far as they concern the nature of the unregistered mark as perceived by trade mark law and its definitional attributes, terms of origin, duration, and expiration of unregistered marks, or more precisely as they concern rights to them, as well as the terms and scope of disposition with unregistered marks, namely in so far as they in turn relate to transfer or conversion and the grant of license or other temporary <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> Subsequently, the establishment of answers to the aforementioned questions addresses the problem of the absence of an explicit legal principle to {{the phenomenon of the}} unregistered mark and the interpretation difficulties offered in the poorly formulated laws and subsequent fluctuations in legal practice. This problem is examined within the legal setting of the Czech Republic as a democratic nation with a market economy, in which holds true the classic legal rudiment of "that which is not prohibited by law is permitted", and in which hold true the fundamental and <b>indefeasible</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> man, a component of which is the right to freely pursue economic activities and possess property within a framework of restrictions favouring the preservation <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> others as set forth by the law...|$|R

Men, with them, are strictly equal, and are entitled to equal rights in their own government. Each head, on this system, would have its vote, and every man would vote directly for the person who was to represent him in the legislature. [...] "But soft,--by regular degrees, not yet." [...] This metaphysic principle, to which law, custom, usage, policy, reason, were to yield, is to yield itself to their pleasure. There must be many degrees, and some stages, before the representative can come in contact with his constituent.

You order him to buy the right which you before told him Nature had given to him gratuitously at his birth, and of which no authority on earth could lawfully deprive him. With regard to the person who cannot come up to your market, a tyrannous aristocracy, as against him, is established at the very outset, by you who pretend to be its sworn foe.|$|R

This right covers the right to drinkable water, livestock drinking water and basic irrigation without a <b>use</b> <b>of</b> special irrigation equipment. The right-holder of the listed types <b>of</b> the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> water resources {{is different from the}} right-holder <b>of</b> the general <b>use</b> <b>of</b> water resources. In the earlier case the right-holder is the owner of the riparian agricultural land. The holder <b>of</b> the general <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> may be any person, under equal terms, regardless of whether he owns agricultural or other type of land next to the waterway. The <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the riparian land owners differs from the general <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> because they enjoy priority over the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> by other persons holding general <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> over waterways.
