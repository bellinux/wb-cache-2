50|$|Because the JPEG output {{files that}} LightZone creates contain the entire {{transformation}} history, edits {{can always be}} undone in a new <b>edit</b> <b>session,</b> long after they were saved. Indeed, the same transformations can be easily reordered and additional transformations applied subsequently to yield further image improvements. Additionally, since transformations always begin with the original RAW image rather than an intermediate JPEG version, JPEG compression related editing artifacts are avoided.|$|E
50|$|Similar to XEDIT, THE uses IBMs REXX as its macro language, {{which makes}} THE highly {{configurable}} and versatile. This provides {{the ability to}} create powerful extensions to the editor and/or customize it to specialized needs. For example, one can create edit commands that would allows one to manipulate columns of text (e.g. copy/move or insert/delete a column of text within a file). With REXX, one can also integrate OS commands or external functions into an <b>edit</b> <b>session.</b> Since version 3.0, THE also has user-configurable syntax highlighting.|$|E
5000|$|Plug-ins {{appeared}} {{as early as}} the mid 1970s, when the EDT text editor running on the Unisys VS/9 operating system using the UNIVAC Series 90 mainframe computers provided the ability to run a program from the editor and to allow such a program to access the editor buffer, thus allowing an external program to access an <b>edit</b> <b>session</b> in memory. [...] The plug-in program could make calls to the editor to have it perform text-editing services upon the buffer that the editor shared with the plug-in. The Waterloo Fortran compiler used this feature to allow interactive compilation of Fortran programs edited by EDT.|$|E

Whilst the paper-tape punch was doing this, again {{spilling}} out its product (albeit not so fast as the reader, and off {{to the left of the}} machine) from its front panel mounting, the programmer could be winding up the old version of the source tape, for it to be kept as a backup version. The free end of the new tape, which was still being punched out, could be labelled in pencil with its program name, version number, and date of punching.|$|E
50|$|Although M-JPEG {{became the}} {{standard}} codec for NLE {{during the early}} 1990s, it had drawbacks. Its high computational requirements ruled out software implementations, leading to the extra cost and complexity of hardware compression/playback cards. More importantly, the traditional tape workflow had involved editing from tape, often in a rented facility. When the editor left the edit suite, they could take their confidential video tapes with them. But the M-JPEG data rate was too high for systems like Avid on the Mac and Lightworks on PC to store the video on removable storage, so these used fixed hard disks instead. The tape paradigm of keeping your (confidential) content with you was not possible with these fixed disks. Editing machines were often rented from facilities houses on a per-hour basis, and some productions chose to delete their material after each <b>edit</b> <b>session,</b> and then recapture {{it the next day}} to guarantee security of their content. In addition, each NLE system had storage limited by its hard disk capacity.|$|E
50|$|The {{first was}} the {{invention}} of time code. Whereas film negative had numbers printed optically {{along the side of}} the film, so that every frame could be identified exactly, video tape had no such system. Only video, audio, and a control pulse were recorded. Early attempts to rectify this were primitive to say the least. An announcer reciting the seconds was recorded onto an audio channel on the tape. Time code introduced frame precision, by recording a machine readable signal on an audio channel. A time code reader device translated this signal into hours, minutes, seconds and frames, originally displayed on a Nixie tube display, and later with LED readouts. This innovation made it possible for the editor to note the exact frames at which to make a cut, and thus be much more precise. He could create a paper edit by writing down the numbers of the first and last frames of each shot, and then arrange them in order on paper prior to the actual <b>edit</b> <b>session</b> with the expensive VTRs.|$|E

5000|$|... vi is a modal editor: it {{operates}} in either insert mode (where typed text {{becomes part of}} the document) or normal mode (where keystrokes are interpreted as commands that control the <b>edit</b> <b>session).</b> For example, typing [...] while in normal mode switches the editor to insert mode, but typing [...] again at this point places an [...] "i" [...] character in the document. From insert mode, pressing [...] switches the editor back to normal mode. A perceived advantage of vi's separation of text entry and command modes is that both text editing and command operations can be performed without requiring the removal of the user's hands from the home row. As non-modal editors usually have to reserve all keys with letters and symbols for the printing of characters, any special commands for actions other than adding text to the buffer must be assigned to keys that do not produce characters, such as function keys, or combinations of modifier keys such as , and [...] with regular keys. Vi has the property that most ordinary keys are connected to some kind of command for positioning, altering text, searching and so forth, either singly or in key combinations.

Yet so much time, effort, thought and energy goes into Albarn's every work that, once more, it should be no wonder that the song's album edit is commensurately splendid, sprinklings of intimate piano tinkering and mumbled bass lines accentuating another typically exemplary recording.

A student wanting {{to learn how to}} create and edit 3 D meshes can quickly find thou-sands of videos explaining the workflow process.

Typical mesh <b>editing</b> <b>sessions</b> involve several hours of work and thousands of operations, which means the video recording can be too long to stay interesting if played back at real-time speed or lose too much informa-tion when sped up.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. July 2016. Major: Computer Science. Advisor: Haiyang Wang. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 63 pages. Recent advances in cloud technology {{have turned the}} idea of Cloud Storage into a reality. Over the past few years, cloud-based file storage/synchronization systems such as Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive, have gained tremendous success among Internet users. The cloud storage systems, most notably Dropbox, not only provide reliable file storage but also enable effective file synchronization with diverse user collaborations. It is thus interesting to explore if this cloud-based file storage system can provide reliable collaboration service for the users. In this thesis, we, for the first time, collect samples of content shared on Dropbox and analyze it. We then take our first step to understand the reliable user collaboration over cloud-based file storage systems using the popular Dropbox as a case study. Our observations indicate that users' updates would be discarded without any warning in a classic collaborative file <b>editing</b> <b>session</b> on Dropbox like file storage systems. In particular, to ensure a reliable service, the users need to wait for over 40 seconds between two updates when their uploading capacity is lower than 100 KBytes/sec. This already exceeds the auto-saving interval of many real world applications and severely hinders the system applicability. We further investigate {{the root causes of}} this phenomenon and find that such a problem is due to the three-layer design(i. e. user client, cloud virtual machines and cloud storage) of cloud storage systems. To address this problem of losing updates in multi-user collaborative file <b>editing</b> <b>session,</b> we propose an enhancement to the system that keeps track of and saves all the user updates locally and provides the opportunity for the recovery of any historical updates. Our proposed enhancement ensures that none of the user updates will be lost during a file <b>editing</b> <b>session</b> irrespective of the time interval between the updates and thereby making Dropbox user collaboration more resilient and less prone to potential data loss...|$|R
