The reason <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> that concept so much at that point in my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E
500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E
500|$|After {{positive}} {{reviews from}} the heavy metal {{press and the}} release of the album Sleep's Holy Mountain (1992) on Earache Records, Sleep's label announced that they would release their follow-up record. Sleep had been touring in Europe with Cathedral and in the United States with Hawkwind in support of Sleep's Holy Mountain when the group felt they had to write new material. The new album {{was going to be an}} hour-long song. This song was written and practiced at sound checks, motel rooms and in friends' houses. Matt Pike said the songwriting process was long and that they were [...] "working on [...] for like four years. We also had two other songs that were working on that were really long, too—like 15 and 20 minutes. But we never recorded them." [...] Al Cisneros stated that smoking cannabis was important to the song's creative process: [...] "I was really dependent on the space I got into when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> it, and some of the lyrics are about that...The line, 'Drop out of life ,' was kind of a creed at that point." [...] The song was originally known and performed live under the title [...] "Dopesmoker". After their tour, the group began to be interested in a Middle Eastern desert theme which led to Sleep referring to the song as [...] "Jerusalem" [...] during later practice sessions.|$|E

Shelton believed that writing his own music had [...] "been a great channel {{for him to}} vent and celebrate his tumultuous year". Rolling Stone stated that Shelton and Stefani [...] " [...] gush about their relationship in the press too much, as they [...] to keep some semblance of privacy. Instead, they wrote a song about it." [...] Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly claimed that [...] "Go Ahead and Break My Heart" [...] served as the parent album's [...] "gossipy framing" [...] for [...] "offer a simultaneous spit-in-the-face and [...] to their exes". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic agreed, finding Shelton [...] "embracing his {{new lease on life}} with renewed vigor and a new a love", who Erlewine later claimed was Stefani. The lyrics of the recording delve on Stefani's insecurities in a relationship that [...] "will likely have its shares of ups and downs": [...] "I'm so scared, I don't know what to do". Additionally, she explains in the lyrics how the two artists met: [...] "I never ever meant to get so into you / Thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> you just to get me through" [...] and [...] "You know I'm broken, I don't trust anymore / Last thing I needed was to fall in love".|$|E
500|$|To {{treat these}} conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, Tretinoin, and Benoquin. On June 29, 2009, {{multiple}} tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone {{were found in}} Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo {{get to the point}} where it makes more sense to remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale. On the other hand, getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult. Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also had hydroxychloroquine injected directly into his scalp regularly. Another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale. For example, Stevie Nicks recalled in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I remember before , Michael sent somebody to find out if I had any foundation make-up he could borrow. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him." [...] Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [...] "Remember the Time," [...] all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.|$|E

2500|$|Duterte {{admitted}} in December 2016 {{that he had}} been a user of the addictive opioid drug Fentanyl. He said that a doctor prescribed the drug to alleviate back pain and headaches, but that he would take more than he was prescribed: [...] "I was only given a fourth of , but no more, because of course my doctor learned that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> the whole patch because I felt better". Fentanyl is described by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse as [...] "a powerful synthetic opioid analgesic that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent". Duterte later denied that he was a drug addict, and a spokesman stated that he was not affected by side-effects of the drug, which include confusion, anxiety and hallucinations.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{his drug}} use increased. In an {{interview}} years later, he stated, [...] "I was 17 when I first experimented with the stuff. In no time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> whatever was available, ... mostly heroin, because I {{had the money}} to pay for it." [...] In 1956, he was arrested for the first time for possession of marijuana, but the charge was dismissed. On July 24, 1956, Hedda Hopper wrote in the Los Angeles Times: [...] "This could cost this fine lad and good actor his career." [...] In 1957, he had only two television parts, that of the loyal brother of a criminal immigrant in M Squad, a long-running crime series starring Lee Marvin, and as an officer aboard the submarine S-38 in an episode of the World War II docudrama series The Silent Service.|$|E
2500|$|After several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to}} apprehend Jackson between 20 and 30 May, Jackson {{was arrested at}} his home on 31 May under Section 10 of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973; {{he was taken to}} Armagh Police Station. This was when the amended information regarding his fingerprints was delivered to Detective Superintendent Ernest Drew at Armagh. Drew and Detective Constable William Elder both questioned him; Jackson denied ever having been at Sinclair's farm whilst admitting knowing him through the Portadown Loyalist Club which they both frequented. When shown the Luger, silencer and magazine (but not the insulating tape), Jackson denied having handled them. When asked by Detective Superintendent Drew to provide an explanation should his fingerprints be discovered on either pistol or silencer, Jackson told him that one night at the Portadown Loyalist Club, Sinclair had asked him for some adhesive tape and Jackson claimed, [...] "I gave him part of the roll <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> in the bar".|$|E

[...] Bava reportedly found Steele difficult to work with. According to Bava, the actress [...] "was somewhat irrational, afraid of Italians. One day she refused to come to the set, because somebody told her <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> a special film-stock that made people appear naked." [...] Steele recalled: [...] "Lord alone knows I was difficult enough. I didn't like my fangs – I had them changed three times. I loathed my wig – I changed that four times. I couldn't understand Italian. I certainly didn't want to allow them to tear open my dress and expose my breasts, so they got a double that I didn't like at all, so I ended up doing it myself – drunk, barely over eighteen, embarrassed and not very easy to be around." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{analysis}} of the damaged Dynasty 6 South Saqqara Stone Annal document gives him a reign of c. 48–49 years {{but this is not}} confirmed by the Turin King List which apparently assigns him 44 years, according to the Danish Egyptologist Kim Ryholt's {{analysis of}} this document. There has been some doubt regarding whether the cattle count dating system was strictly biennial or slightly more irregular. That the latter situation appeared to be the case was suggested by the famous Year after the 18th Count, 3rd Month of Shemu day 27 inscription from Wadi Hammamat No. 74-75 which mentions the [...] "first occurrence of the Heb Sed" [...] in that year for Pepi. as well as a Year after the 18th Count, 4th Month of Shemu day 5 date in Sinai graffito No. 106 as the French Egyptologist Michel Baud noted in a 2006 book on Egyptian chronology. This would be the year 36 if the biennial dating system was used. This information is significant because the Heb Sed Feast was always celebrated in a king's Year 30. If Pepi <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> a biennial counting system during his reign, these heb sed inscriptions should have been dated to the Year after the 15th Count instead. This could imply that the cattle count during the 6th dynasty was not regularly biennial. Michel Baud, however, stresses that the Year of the 18th count is preserved in the South Saqqara Stone and writes that: ...|$|E
2500|$|From Peterhoff, Maria Pavlovna went to Grand Duchess Elisabeth’s rural estate, Ilinskoe, near Moscow, where Wilhelm {{joined them}} for a month before he left on a cruise to America. The young couple {{maintained}} their intimacy through letters. Maria imagined herself in love: “It’s lovely to have somebody, even far away, who love you more than anything and whom you love more than everybody on earth“, she wrote to him. In October, Wilhelm returned to Russia joining Grand Duchess Maria and her brother Dimitri who introduced the Swedish prince to their father, Grand Duke Paul, who was permitted {{to come back to}} Russia for his daughter's wedding set to take place after she turned eighteen the next April. At Wilhelm's departure, Maria wrote to him: [...] " [...] I love you, so much with every day, every hour more and more. I wish it were April now, how lovely it would be". [...] In her book of memoirs, written more than 20 years later, the grand duchess made different claims: [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> Wilhelm, in a sense, only to obtain my freedom". [...] As the wedding day approached, she began to have doubts and wished to break off the engagement, but Princess Irene of Hesse who was visiting her sister, Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna, persuaded her otherwise.
