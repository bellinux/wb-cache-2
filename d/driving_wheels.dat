5|$|Sandusky {{included}} features {{designed by}} Thomas Rogers {{that had not}} been seen in locomotive construction to date. It was also the first locomotive to use cast iron <b>driving</b> <b>wheels,</b> and the wheels included built-in counterweights {{to reduce the amount of}} wear on the track caused by the weight of the driving rod and wheel all coming down at once during the wheels' rotations. Before Sanduskys construction, <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> were typically built with wooden spokes, much like wagon wheels. Some accounts also state that Sandusky was the first locomotive to feature a whistle, but this has since been proven false.|$|E

5|$|On both trains, the {{locomotive}} faces towards Hogsmeade station; {{it is not}} possible for the trains to face King's Cross. The Hogwarts Express enters King's Cross in reverse but forwards at Hogsmeade; the train departs King's Cross forwards and in reverse at Hogsmeade. As a result, the trains are only designed to be seen from one side as {{the locomotive}}s' false <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> and specific detailing only exist on one side.|$|E

25|$|Vehicles with {{a single}} <b>driving</b> <b>wheel.</b> Besides motorcycles, which are {{generally}} not classified as automobiles, this group includes most three-wheeled cars. These were quite common in Europe in the mid-20th Century, but have now become rare there. They are still common {{in some areas of}} the developing world, such as India. Some early four-wheeled cars also had only one <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> to avoid the need for a differential. However, this arrangement led to many problems. The system was unbalanced, the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> would easily spin, etc. Because of these problems, few such vehicles were made.|$|R

5|$|The 20 {{locomotives}} of {{the first}} production batch were split equally between Brighton and Ashford works, and all were completed by December 1929. The production locomotives had a slightly different profile to the K class rebuilds and featured left-hand drive to improve the visibility of signals from the driver's side of the footplate. They also had higher running plates {{along the sides of}} the boiler than the rebuilds, which required smaller wheel splashers to cover the tops of the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels.</b> Another variation was the flatter top to the dome covers, as the rebuilds retained the high N class type used on the K class.|$|E
5|$|The Smithsonian {{recognized}} the locomotive's age in 1931, but, since the museum didn't have {{the funds to}} refurbish the locomotive for full operation again, {{it was decided to}} run the locomotive in place (with the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> lifted off the rails using jacks) with compressed air. The museum borrowed an 1836 coach from the Pennsylvania Railroad to display on the track behind the newly rebuilt tender, and the locomotive's 100th birthday was officially celebrated on November 12, 1931. The locomotive's semi-operation was broadcast over the CBS radio network with Stanley Bell narrating the ceremonies for the radio audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> which were lighter, yet stronger than the spoked equivalent. These proved to be successful and were later used on other Bulleid classes. The leading bogie was based upon that of the SR Lord Nelson class, although it had a 6ft 3 in (1.90 m) wheelbase as opposed to Maunsell's 7ft 6 in (2.28 m) design, and featured 3ft 1 in (0.94 m) BFB wheels. A long coupled driving wheelbase was incorporated into the design, to keep the locomotives within the lineal loading of the Southern Railway's narrower bridges. The supporting rear trailing truck was a one-piece steel casting that gave the smoothest of rides; the design was utilised in the future BR Standard Class 7.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the U class is complex as it {{is linked to the}} fate of the 2-cylinder K ("River") class 2-6-4 tank locomotives. The design work had for a new {{passenger}} 2-6-0 with 6ft (1.83 m) <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> was complete by 1927, when the involvement of a K class locomotive in the Sevenoaks rail crash presented an opportunity to bring forward construction of the class. The K class tank engines were the passenger counterpart to the N class 2-6-0 mixed-traffic design, and were noted for rough-riding over the cheaply laid track of the former SECR. The class was withdrawn from service, and the inquiry that followed determined that the rough-riding contributed to the crash. Its recommendation was that the K class should be rebuilt to 2-6-0 tender locomotives, using tried and tested features used by Maunsell and his assistant, the former GWR engineer Harold Holcroft on the N class.|$|E
5|$|One {{member of}} the Lord Nelson class was {{involved}} in {{what could have been}} a major accident on 23 January 1930. This entailed the leading <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> jumping off the track, though the locomotive ran for many yards before they re-railed themselves over a point. No. 860 Lord Hawke was derailed at , Hampshire on 14 August 1940 due to enemy action. a bomb fell on the track ahead of the train, which was unable to stop in time. No. 852 received a direct hit from an enemy bomb on 18 April 1941, and was so severely damaged that it was not returned to service until June 1942. No. 854 suffered a firebox failure due to lack of water 23 April 1945, killing the fireman and injuring the driver. No. 851 Sir Walter Raleigh was involved in a serious derailment at Byfleet in December 1946, due to the poor condition of the permanent way. On 26 November 1947, No. 860 Lord Hawke was hauling a passenger train that was run into by another at , Hampshire due to a signalman's error. Two people were killed. No. 30854 Howard of Effingham was hauling a passenger train that overran signals and was derailed by trap points at , Hampshire on 20 July 1952.|$|E
5|$|The company's {{financial}} difficulties after 1866 had precluded the purchasing of any more locomotives until six 4-4-0 locomotives {{were built in}} 1876 by Neilson's, partly to replace the Deeside locomotives. These had larger boilers and fireboxes than previous locomotives and {{were the first to}} be built with cabs. The next twelve locomotives had rounded splashers over the trailing <b>driving</b> <b>wheels,</b> meaning the shape of the cab was different, but retained the brass dome on the firebox, copper capped chimney and had brass bands joining the firebox and boiler. After James Manson became locomotive superintendent in 1883 he introduced a more contemporary design of locomotive, with inside cylinders and doors on the side of cabs and without brass domes or copper chimneys. The first six were built by Kitson & Co in Leeds in 1884, followed by three similar but lighter in 1885. The railway had inherited most of its tank engines from the Deeside, Morayshire and Banffshire Railways and these needed replacing, so six arrived in 1884 and three slightly larger the following year. The first tank engines in the country to be fitted with doors on the cabs, these worked on the suburban services and one was fitted with a cowcatcher to work the St Combs Light Railway at Fraserburgh. In 1887 two locomotives were built at Kittybrewster works. Although there was only space for four locomotives in the cramped repair shops the board expected to save £300 to £400 by building the locomotives themselves. Nine express locomotives with six-wheeled tenders were built by Kitsons in 1888 and these were followed by six more with eight-wheeled tenders built by Stephenson & Co, one of which was successfully trialled in 1914 with a superheater. Most of Manson's later locomotives were subsequently fitted with superheaters, the eight-wheeled tenders being replaced in most cases with six-wheeled tenders during the rebuild.|$|E

5|$|Out of {{a desire}} to have four trains {{regularly}} running at once each day on the DRR, in the mid-1990s the Disneyland park began to search for an additional narrow-gauge steam locomotive to add to the railroad's rolling stock. One such locomotive was acquired from Bill Norred in 1996 in exchange for the combine car and four coaches from the DRR's retired Retlaw 1 passenger train set, but after the park received it, the new locomotive was deemed to be too large for the DRR's operations. It was then sent to the Walt Disney World Railroad in the Magic Kingdom park of Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, where the locomotive was dedicated, despite being too small for the railroad's operations, and named after Disney animator and rail enthusiast Ward Kimball. Still needing a fifth locomotive for the DRR, the park traded the Ward Kimball locomotive in 1999 to the Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad in the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, for a new locomotive suitable for the railroad. Named Maud L., the locomotive was built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1902 and was originally used to haul sugar cane at the Laurel Valley Sugar Plantation in Louisiana owned by the Barker and Lepine Company. After arriving in Disneyland, the Maud L., later renamed Ward Kimball like the locomotive for which it was traded, was given a new cab built by Disney and a new boiler built by Hercules Power, which was subcontracted by Superior Boiler Works. Due to budget issues, the restoration of the locomotive was suspended not long after its arrival, and its parts were planned to be placed in long-term storage in late 2003. The Ward Kimball locomotive's restoration efforts were resurrected soon after, when it was decided that its addition to the DRR would be incorporated into the celebration of Disneyland's fiftieth anniversary in July 2005. In late 2004, Boschan Boiler and Restorations led by Paul Boschan, a former roundhouse manager and engineer at the Roaring Camp & Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad in Felton, California, was awarded the contract to complete the restoration of the Ward Kimball. The restoration work performed included installing new <b>driving</b> <b>wheels,</b> attaching a new smokebox door, and applying gold-leaf silhouettes of Kimball's Jiminy Cricket character {{on the sides of the}} headlamp. The Ward Kimball locomotive, which entered service on June 25, 2005, became the DRR's No. 5 locomotive, and on February 15 the following year, John Kimball, the son of Ward Kimball, who died in 2002, christened the locomotive during its dedication ceremony.|$|E

25|$|Mallet's {{aforementioned}} rigid wheelbase divided-drive schemes, although {{never actually}} applied, may have inspired Francis Webb in Britain. After trials {{with an old}} single-driver converted into a 2-cylinder compound in 1878, he introduced in 1882 his first Experiment class with similar divided-drive: 3-cylinder compounds with uncoupled <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> in which two small outside high-pressure cylinders exhausted into one large low-pressure one between the frames. Other similar classes followed, progressively enlarged. The uncoupled <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> were problematic as the two pairs of wheels could be rotating in opposite directions on starting, if a locomotive had previously backed onto its train. The arrangement {{appears to have been}} adopted due to lack of space, but Tuplin has pointed out that if Walschaert's valve gear had been fitted, the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> could have been coupled in the normal way.|$|E

25|$|Stephenson's {{most visible}} {{decision}} {{was to use}} {{a single pair of}} <b>driving</b> <b>wheels,</b> with a small carrying axle behind. This was the first 0-2-2 and first single driver locomotive. The use of single drivers gave several advantages. The weight of coupling rods was avoided and the second axle could be smaller and lightweight, as it only carried a small proportion of the weight. Rocket placed just over 2½tons of its 4¼ton total weight onto its <b>driving</b> <b>wheels,</b> a higher axle load than Sans Pareil, even though the 0-4-0 was heavier overall at 5ton, and officially disqualified by being over the 4½ton limit. Early locomotive designers had been concerned that the adhesion of a locomotive's <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> would be inadequate, but Stephenson's past experience convinced him that this would not be a problem, particularly with the light trains of the trials contest.|$|E

40|$|Considering the {{underlying}} reason of tire polygonal wear, a unified mechanical tire model is developed {{to analyze the}} different vibration properties between the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> and follower wheel. And the LuGre dynamic friction model is applied to determine the frictional forces between the wheel with a slip angel and the road. Through the stability analysis with Lyapunov theory, {{it is found that}} tread self-excited vibration is periodic oscillation caused by Hopf bifurcation. The analysis of the lateral vibration of <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> shows that the tread vibration system loses its stability and self-excited vibration occurs when the wheel is rolling at a high speed, is over-loaded, is having a large toe-in angle, or is under a low tire pressure. On this basis, the dynamic behaviors of the <b>driving</b> and follower <b>wheels</b> are distinguished with different slip rates by the numerical simulation. Compared with the dynamic behaviors of the follower wheel under the same condition, the self-excited vibration occurs on the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> with more limited parameter scope, lower oscillation energy, and lower occurrence, which explains why the polygonal wear is less likely to occur on the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} related to the {{development}} of plug-in air powered four wheel motorcycles drive train system that transfers rotational energy from power train to the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel.</b> The objective of this thesis is to develop an air hybrid drivetrain unit and control the power and torque from the powertrain to the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> by using sequential manual transmission. This thesis describes the process of developing sequential shift-by-wire system to make gear shifting for easier for 4 wheel motorcycle. The controller used in this project was 18 F PIC 4550 microprocessor. The system programming performed using FLOWCODE version 4. 0. 2 units of electromechanical linear actuator were used in this project as an actuator for gear shifting on a manual transmission. Chain drives were selected as power transfer linkage from air hybrid engine to the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> with under drive configuration. Besides the development of shift-by-wire system, the torque on the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> also had been calculated and analysed. In additional, the maximum speed that can be achieved by four wheel motorcycles was also calculated...|$|R
25|$|During the {{construction}} of the DD class, a number of changes were made. The first locomotives built featured low running plates with splashers over the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> and a narrow cab. However, after 26 such examples were built the design was altered with high running plates mounted above the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> and a more comfortable full-width pressed metal cab of Canadian design, a feature incorporated at the request of Victorian Railways Chief Commissioner and former Canadian Pacific Railway Transportation Manager Thomas Tait. These became hallmarks of all subsequent VR steam locomotive designs.|$|E
25|$|The Engerth design {{articulated}} the tender {{with the main}} locomotive frame, allowing some {{of the weight of}} the fuel and water to be carried on the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> to improve adhesion. Because the tender was articulated, rather than directly attached to the frame, the locomotive could traverse relatively sharp curves, while still enjoying the advantage of the additional adhesive weight gain. The original design also included an indirect drive from the main <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> to the wheels under the tender. This arrangement proved too complex to maintain and was dropped from the design.|$|E
25|$|Running gear {{includes}} the brake gear, wheel sets, axleboxes, springing and the motion that includes connecting rods and valve gear. The {{transmission of the}} power from the pistons to the rails and the behaviour of the locomotive as a vehicle, being able to negotiate curves, points and irregularities in the track, is of paramount importance. Because reciprocating power has to be directly applied to the rail from 0rpm upwards, this creates the problem of adhesion of the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> to the smooth rail surface. Adhesive weight is {{the portion of the}} locomotive's weight bearing on the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels.</b> This is made more effective if a pair of <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> is able {{to make the most of}} its axle load, i.e. its individual share of the adhesive weight. Locomotives with equalising beams connecting the ends of plate springs have often been deemed a complication, however locomotives fitted with the beams have usually been less prone to loss of traction due to wheel-slip.|$|E
