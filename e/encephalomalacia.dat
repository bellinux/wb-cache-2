40|$|Mabs {{directed}} against phosphorylated epitopes on the heavy and medium neurofilament protein {{were used to}} immunostain histological sections from brains of patients without neurological disease and patients suffering from SDAT, Pick's disease, Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and <b>encephalomalacias</b> of the white matter inducing chromatolysis in the overlying cortex. In normal brains only axons but never perikarya were stained. In the pathological brains, however, swollen neurons with chromatolysis and swollen cells in Pick's disease, NFT in SDAT, Pick bodies in Pick's disease, the centers of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease and some tangles in progressive supranuclear palsy were stained. These changes are perikaryal alterations. The results are discussed {{in relation to the}} formation of NFT in SDAT, i. e. the PHF as seen by electron microscopy. It is concluded that in spite of the reliable staining of NFT with some of our mabs, with sera {{directed against}} PHF, MAPs and other cytoskeletal proteins there is no absolutely specific immunoreaction for PHF. The most similar pattern to that observed in NFTs of SDAT is seen in the Pick bodies of Pick's disease, although these do not consist of PHF when looked at with the electron microscope, and although they behave differently from NFT in some 'conventional' histological stains. From this nonspecificity of the immunoreaction and from the presence of multiple cytoskeletal epitopes in NFT it is concluded that NFT (i. e. PHF) are probably not derived from one particular cytoskeletal element but are reassembled from proteolytic breakdown fragments of several of these elements. In this regard the similarities and dissimilarities with the alterations of Pick's disease might be specially relevant and deserve further studies, especially as the clinical features of SDAT and Pick's disease can be very similar.

The effect of the damage to the paramedian thalamic region did not astonish researchers because of its connection to the cingulate cortex. Thalamic infarctions have produced hypometabolism, a decrease in metabolic rate, in the frontal areas and hypoperfusion resulting in UB.

5000|$|Porencephaly is an {{extremely}} rare cephalic disorder involving <b>encephalomalacia.</b> It is a neurological disorder of {{the central nervous system}} characterized by cysts or cavities within the cerebral hemisphere. Porencephaly was termed by Heschl in 1859 to describe a cavity in the human brain. Derived from Greek roots, the word porencephaly means 'holes in the brain'. [...] The cysts and cavities are usually the result of destructive or cystic brain lesions but can also be from abnormal development, direct damage, inflammation, or hemorrhage. The cysts and cavities cause a wide range of physiological, physical, and neurological symptoms. Depending on the patient, this disorder may cause only minor neurological problems, without any disruption on intelligence, while others may be severely disabled or face death before the second decade of their lives. However, this disorder is far more common within infants, and porencephaly can occur in both before or after birth.|$|E

40|$|Although vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAM) can be {{diagnosed}} in the fetus, {{the challenge is}} predicting the occurrence of its 2 major complications: cardiopulmonary failure and <b>encephalomalacia.</b> This study attempts to determine which fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features {{might be used to}} predict the development of these complications at birth. The cohort was extracted from a prospectively assembled database of VGAM cases managed at a single referral center from 2000 to 2014. Of 251 patients with VGAM, 83 cases were diagnosed prenatally. A total of 58 patient charts having at least 1 fetal MRI were reviewed. Patterns of brain parenchyma, hydrocephalus, and so-called middle cerebral artery (MCA) "pseudofeeders" were correlated with cardiac failure, pulmonary hypertension, and <b>encephalomalacia</b> at birth. The median gestational age at fetal MRI was 32. 3 weeks of pregnancy (± 2. 3). Nine fetuses (16 %) had <b>encephalomalacia.</b> Thirty-one fetuses (53 %) had MCA pseudofeeders. Twenty-six fetuses (45 %) had prenatal hydrocephalus. Prenatal MCA pseudofeeders were a risk factor for <b>encephalomalacia</b> at birth (p[*]=[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction - <b>Encephalomalacia</b> in a {{developing}} fetus {{is a rare}} and devastating neurological finding on radiologic imaging.

Four weeks after her discharge, marked fetal cerebral ventriculomegaly was noted on ultrasound. A subsequent fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated extensive, symmetric cystic <b>encephalomalacia,</b> primarily involving both cerebral hemispheres. The pregnancy was continued with close fetal and maternal surveillance. The patient underwent a repeat cesarean delivery in her 37 th week. The infant had a 1 [*]month neonatal intensive care unit stay with care rendered by a multiple disciplinary team of pediatric subspecialists. The postnatal course was complicated by global hypotonia, poor feeding, delayed development and ultimately required anticonvulsants for recurrent seizures.

40|$|THE anti-vitamin E {{effect of}} unsatu-rated fats, {{particularly}} fish oils, {{has been known}} for some time; and this effect has been demonstrated with many species of animals.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTuberculous {{meningitis}} (TBM) and {{herpes simplex}} encephalitis (HSE) are common neurological diseases involving the brain parenchyma, and both can result in chronic epilepsy. Here, we identified possible variables affecting the prognosis of central nervous system (CNS) infection-related epilepsy. MethodsThe clinical seizure characteristics and demographic data of 20 TBM- and 55 HSE-related epilepsy patients were compared. Statistically significant prognostic variables were identified using multiple regression analysis. ResultsSex, age at infection, age at epilepsy onset, presence of seizures {{at the time of}} infection, latency period, and seizure characteristics between two groups were similar except for the pattern of brain lesions observed on the MRI and their overall prognosis. Patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) only comprised 30 % and 52. 7 % of the TBM and HSE groups, respectively. <b>Encephalomalacia</b> had a positive effect in the HSE group while HS had a negative effect in this group, but no significant effects were found in the TBM group. Through a multiple regression analysis with a correction for group effects, HS was associated with a poor prognosis. However, <b>encephalomalacia</b> was concomitantly associated with a good prognosis. In addition, a short latency period, with a one-year interval, and being male were both associated with a good prognosis, while the age at the onset of epilepsy was associated with a poor prognosis.
