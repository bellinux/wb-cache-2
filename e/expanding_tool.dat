The test specimen ‘in the form a tube was made of austenitic stainless steel 17 240 (1. 4301, X 5 CrNi 18 - 10). During the experiment, the radial <b>expanding</b> <b>tool</b> was quasi-statically charged by the internal fluid pressure. In the introductory part, the thesis focuses on the stress-strain description of the method of tube bulging and possible ways of detecting the strain of material during forming. The experimental part is primarily focused on the analysis of the test sample that was obtained from the experiment. Theoretical approaches were used to analyze the real test sample to detect strain and stress in material, numerical simulation of the bulge process and 3 D ATOS scanning device, which helped clarify behavior tube during bulging process. At the end of the thesis is proposed possible design of the tool. This modification should contribute in the future to the full functionality of the radial <b>expanding</b> <b>tool,</b> or the bulging of the tube by liquid...|$|E
40|$|Library-based and pre-compiled {{visualization}} tools incur many penalties that {{hinder the}} adoption of visualization as a technique for many fields. Libraries necessitate familiarity with the data structures and control flows that are incumbent in traditional programming, but not central to visualization. Task-specific visualization applications alleviate these needs, but induce users to move data between applications as their needs change. An ever <b>expanding</b> <b>tool</b> chain and corresponding context switches are inefficient. We propose a generative programming approach to visualization tool construction based on domain specific languages. Through it, we provide the flexibility of a general purpose programming language that abstracts out many of the control flow and data structure issues. Our initial prototype, ThisStar, creates star-maps based on these general ideas. ThisStar demonstrates the viability of these concepts and illuminates opportunities...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Tube {{expansion}} {{is the last}} forming operation of the UOE process {{for the production of}} welded pipes. This process is carried out by pressing a steel plate into a U and then O shape prior to welding. Then a radial {{expansion is}} applied in order to obtain a final circumferential shape. The expander is composed of a truncated pyramid, which acts as a bar parallel to the tube axis, covered with several expanding tools (usually 8 to 12) which looks like truncated circular sectors. They are placed such that an axial displacement of the central bar produces the tube expansion. In order to improve the expander design, in particular to optimize the contact pressure distribution between the expanding tools and the central bar, a complex three dimensional numerical model of this process was developed considering frictional contact in the interactions between the different parts of the model (central bar, expanding tools and tube). Material non-linearity is also present since the tube is plastically deformed. Model results were useful to understand the impact of the <b>expanding</b> <b>tool</b> longitudinal profile on the contact pressure distribution and on the total horizontal force required to expand the tube...|$|E
40|$|Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) is a grain legume {{commonly}} {{grown and}} consumed {{in many parts}} of the tropics and subtropics. A genetic linkage map was constructed using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and a recombinant inbred (RI) population of 159 individuals derived from a cross between the breeding line 524 B, a California Blackeye, and 219 - 01, a perennial wild cowpea from Kenya. Out of 912 primer combinations predicted to amplify SSRs in cowpea, 639 reliably produced amplification products in PCR assays and 202 (31. 6 %) were polymorphic between the two parents. These polymorphic SSRs were used to construct a genetic map consisting of 11 linkage groups (LGs) spanning 677 cM, with an average distance between markers of 3 cM. Agronomic traits related to domestication (seed weight, pod shattering) were analyzed together with the genotypic data. Six quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seed size were revealed with the phenotypic variation ranging from 8. 9 to 19. 1 %. Four QTL for pod shattering were identified with the phenotypic variation ranging from 6. 4 to 17. 2 %. The QTL for seed size and pod shattering mainly cluster in two areas of LGs 1 and 10, facilitating the use of marker-assisted selection to eliminate undesirable wild phenotypes in breeding activities involving introgression of traits from wild germplasm. The generation of an SSR-based molecular map and additional trait-linked markers also contributes to the <b>expanding</b> <b>tool</b> kit available to cowpea breeders, especially in Africa...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSpatial navigation, which {{involves}} higher cognitive functions, is frequently implemented in daily activities, and {{is critical to}} the participation of human beings in mainstream environments. Virtual reality is an <b>expanding</b> <b>tool,</b> which enables on one hand the assessment of the cognitive functions involved in spatial navigation, and on the other the rehabilitation of patients with spatial navigation difficulties. Topographical disorientation is a frequent deficit among patients suffering from neurological diseases. The use of virtual environments enables the information incorporated into the virtual environment to be manipulated empirically. But the impact of manipulations seems differ according to their nature (quantity, occurrence, and characteristics of the stimuli) and the target population. We performed a systematic review of research on virtual spatial navigation covering the period from 2005 to 2015. We focused first on the contribution of virtual spatial navigation for patients with brain injury or schizophrenia, or in the context of ageing and dementia, and then on the impact of visual or auditory stimuli on virtual spatial navigation. On the basis of 6521 abstracts identified in 2 databases (Pubmed and Scopus) with the keywords « navigation » and « virtual », 1103 abstracts were selected by adding the keywords "ageing", "dementia", "brain injury", "stroke", "schizophrenia", "aid", "help", "stimulus" and "cue"; Among these, 63 articles were included in the present qualitative analysis. Unlike pencil-and-paper tests, virtual reality is useful to assess large-scale navigation strategies in patients with brain injury or schizophrenia, or in the context of ageing and dementia. Better knowledge about both the impact of the different aids and the cognitive processes involved is essential for the use of aids in neurorehabilitation...|$|E
