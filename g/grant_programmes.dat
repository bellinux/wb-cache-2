Both these functions {{are expected to be}} mutually balanced so as the organic farms were not focused on one-sided production. To reach such balance the <b>grant</b> <b>programmes</b> should be suitably set so that the farms were motivated to farm on arable land and permanent grasslands on one side and fulfil non-production function of agriculture on the other side as well. The balance of <b>grant</b> <b>programmes</b> can be estimated according to the way how organic farming is carried on.
