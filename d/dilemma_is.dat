5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his <b>dilemma</b> <b>is</b> worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{studying}} cognitive conflicts using the repertory grid technique is presented. By means of this technique, implicative <b>dilemmas</b> can <b>be</b> identified, cognitive structures {{in which a}} personal construct for which change is wished for implies undesirable change on another construct. We assessed the presence of dilemmas and the severity of symptoms in 46 participants who met criteria for dysthymia and compared then to a non-clinical group composed of 496 participants.

Implicative <b>dilemmas</b> <b>were</b> found in almost 70 % of the dysthymic participants in contrast to 39 % of controls and in greater quantity. In addition, participants in both groups with this type of conflict showed more depressive symptoms and general distress than those without dilemmas. Furthermore, a greater number of implicative <b>dilemmas</b> <b>was</b> associated with higher levels of symptom severity. Finally, content analysis results showed that implicative <b>dilemmas</b> <b>are</b> frequently composed of a constellation of moral values and emotion, indicating that symptoms are often related to moral aspects of the self and so change processes may be hindered.

40|$|Despite {{considerable}} divergences {{about what}} <b>dilemmas</b> <b>are</b> {{and what they}} show, philosophers largely concur that significant moral <b>dilemmas</b> <b>are</b> tragic and arise because of value-pluralism (Gowans, 1987; Mason, 1996). The paradigmatic example {{of this kind of}} predicament is Sartre’s case of the student torn between the requirement to join the Forces Françaises Libres and the requirement to assist his ailing mother (Sartre 1946, 39 - 40). 2 There seem to <b>be</b> moral <b>dilemmas,</b> however, that <b>are</b> not tragic and do not involve conflicting values. Take, for example, Beate, a mother who deliberates about the education of her twins, Ute and Greta. She determines that they should study piano, but she cannot afford piano lessons for both. After deliberation, Beate realizes that there are no moral grounds for discriminating between these alternatives: she is required to support Ute for the same reason she is required to support Greta.

25|$|The <b>dilemma</b> <b>is</b> that {{classical}} {{evolutionary theory}} says {{that what is}} maintained in a lineage is that which ensures the viability of an organism and its offspring. Ageing can only cut off an individual's capacity to reproduce. So, according to classical theory, ageing could only evolve as a side effect, or epiphenomenon of selection. The disposable soma theory and antagonistic pleiotropy theory are examples in which a compensating individual benefit, compatible with classical evolution theory (See neo-Darwinism) is proposed. Nevertheless, there is accumulated evidence that ageing looks like an adaptation in its own right, selected for its own sake.|$|E
25|$|The central concept {{around which}} this play is built is {{the dilemma of}} what to do with Harry and Edna. Their {{situation}} is the focal point for all the characters, including Harry and Edna themselves. Albee uses this dilemma to cause emotions to rise. As his characters try to figure out what to do about the Harry and Edna, they have a series of discussions or debates that slowly rise in emotional temperature. Each character has his or her definition of what the <b>dilemma</b> <b>is,</b> as well as a means for resolving it. The tension in the play rises with the rise of emotions as the characters move toward a climax or a moment of truth. This moment is played out most specifically by Tobias and Harry in the conversation that defines their friendship: one that is built on rights and responsibilities rather than love and affection. In the end, Harry and Edna decide to go back home, thus solving, or at least releasing some of the tension of the dilemma.|$|E

Humbert's {{solution}} to this <b>dilemma</b> <b>is</b> to marry Charlotte, not because he loves her but to stay close to Dolores. Later, Charlotte voices her plan to send Dolores to a boarding school when she returns from camp. Humbert then contemplates murdering Charlotte to remain close to Dolores but stops before carrying it out. A few days later, Charlotte finds Humbert's diary and furiously confronts him, telling him he will never see Dolores again. Charlotte then runs out of the house to mail letters she's written to friends about Humbert's obsession with Dolores but is killed by a passing car. Humbert recovers the letters from the accident scene and then burns them. Later, he convinces Charlotte's friends and neighbors that he is Dolores's biological father from a previous affair.|$|E

25|$|When {{comparing}} the sexual self-concepts of adolescent girls and boys, {{researchers found that}} boys experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated they were less able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state {{that this may be}} because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, that boys don’t learn these skills and are less able to use them when they want to say no to sex. They also explain how society’s stereotype that boys are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because it is something society tells them they should want. Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant and in control, they are limited in how they feel it is appropriate to act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they can’t attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many boys {{do not know how to}} retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships.

40|$|Some sex {{and empathy}} {{differences}} {{have been found}} in moral reasoning patterns in adults (e. g., Pratt, Golding, and Kerig, in press; Walker and DeVries, 1985). However, until recently the area of moral judgment was severely restricted by an exclusive focus on the measures of a few researchers such as Kohlberg (1969, 1976, 1981, 1984). Gilligan (1977, 1982) has been primarily responsible for the upsurge of interest and resultant diversification of measures in this area of individual differences. The present paper examined in detail how sex differences and level of empathy affect moral reasoning patterns in individuals between 18 and 25 years of age. Hypothetical <b>dilemmas</b> <b>were</b> rewritten to make them either more or less vivid, within three conditions: 1) Subjective, in which the original <b>dilemma</b> <b>was</b> rewritten to include engaging personal information about the dilemma characters; 2) Objective, in which the original <b>dilemma</b> <b>was</b> rewritten to include non-engaging statistical information; and, 3) Neutral, in which the original <b>dilemma</b> <b>was</b> not altered. Each <b>dilemma</b> <b>was</b> followed by bipolar adjective scales for each character in the dilemma, which assessed the empathy level of the subject for that character. Overall patterns of personel empathy were assessed using the Mehrabian-Epstein scale. Moral reasoning patterns were assessed through Pratt’s Information-Seeking Questionnaire (Pratt, Golding, Hunter, and Norris, in press), as well as by Pratt’s Judgment Questionnaire (Pratt, Golding, Hunter, and Sampson, 1986), and the Gilligan Personal Moral Dilemma Task (Gilligan, 1982). In addition, the type of hypothetical <b>dilemmas</b> <b>was</b> varied to assess whether there was a difference in response due to the structure of the dilemma. Four hypothetical <b>dilemmas</b> <b>were</b> used in the present study, two Kohlberg dilemmas (based on a justice framework) and two Eisenberg dilemmas (based on a pro-social framework). Empathy for the characters in the <b>dilemmas</b> <b>was</b> found to be the highest in the subjective condition, and lowest in the objective condition, as hypothesized. However, this effect of <b>dilemma</b> vividness <b>was</b> only true for individuals high in personal empathy; low empathy individuals demonstrated no difference in responding, regardless of condition. In terms of moral reasoning, {{the results of this study}} indicate that patterns of moral reasoning are related to individual differences in empathy. Personal empathy was the strongest predictor variable, and was mediated in part by character empathy. Sex differences were largely overshadowed by these individual differences in reported personal empathy for both dilemma types. Women did, however, request significantly more information overall than did men on the Information-Seeking questionnaire. Dilemma type also had an effect on moral reasoning patterns. Individuals, regardless of sex, requested more information and endorsed more judgment considerations for the Kohlberg dilemmas than for the Eisenberg dilemmas. Also, more rights information was sought and more normative/fairness considerations were endorsed for the Kohlberg dilemmas than for the Eisenberg <b>dilemmas.</b> It <b>is</b> suggested that future research focus on individual differences in personal empathy as a motivating factor in relation to the vividness effect, and also in relation to the Kohlberg stage levels of moral reasoning. Furthermore, hypothetical <b>dilemma</b> type should <b>be</b> taken into account in future studies involving the moral reasoning process...|$|R
