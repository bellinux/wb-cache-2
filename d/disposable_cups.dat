It is {{sold as a}} street food from carts or stalls, in <b>disposable</b> <b>cups</b> with thick sweet syrup and various crunchy toppings such as chopped pistachios or coconut. Its popularity has resulted in supermarkets selling it in plastic packages and restaurants serving richer and more sophisticated versions using various toppings and garnishes such as berries and fruit. Sahlab is a similar dessert made from the powdered tubers of orchids and milk.|$|E

40|$|When making {{coffee or}} milk tea in a <b>disposable</b> <b>cup,</b> a {{stirring}} spoon is usually needed. The spoon is usually thrown away right after use, causing waste. Furthermore, when hot water is poured into a <b>disposable</b> <b>cup,</b> holding it with bare hands {{is a difficult}} task. Therefore, this design idea came up. The handle of the spoon can be clipped on the edge {{and bottom of the}} <b>disposable</b> <b>cup</b> and become a handle, making it more convenient to pick up the cup. If necessary, the spoon can be taken off the cup and used for stirring. It can then be attached back to the cup after washing. The purpose of environmental protection can be achieved with this design...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: There {{are many}} {{settings}} {{in which a}} spacer device is not available for the administration of bronchodilator. Therefore, we tested whether a paper <b>disposable</b> <b>cup</b> is as effective as a commercially produced spacer to administer bronchodilator. Methodology: Randomised controlled trial. 50 subjects aged 16 – 50 years who had wheeze and a greater than 10 % decrease in FEV 1 after histamine inhalation test (HIT). Subjects were randomised to either the 150 ml paper <b>disposable</b> <b>cup</b> group (CUP) or the commercially produced spacer group (SPACER). Twenty minutes after 400 μg salbutamol was administered FEV 1 was measured. The recovery index measured post-bronchodilator FEV 1 {{as a percentage of}} baseline FEV 1. Also, analysis of covariance tested whether recovery of FEV 1 was related to the magnitude of the fall following the HIT. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between CUP and SPACER groups in any characteristics. There was no difference for the recovery index (t 48 = 1. 14,P = 0. 26). Regression analyses showed that the relation between the magnitude of the fall in FEV 1 during the HIT and the percent recovery was not different between the CUP and SPACER groups (t=− 1. 2,P < 0. 23). Conclusions: A paper <b>disposable</b> <b>cup</b> was effective for the reversal of mild to moderate bronchoconstriction. Therefore, a paper <b>disposable</b> <b>cup</b> can be used for the first-aid management of asthma when there is concern about cross-infection and a commercially produced spacer is not available...|$|R
25|$|Soft drinks may {{be served}} chilled, over ice cubes {{or at room}} temperature. In rare cases, some soft drinks, such as Dr Pepper, and Pepsi can be served warm.

50|$|The <b>disposable</b> {{cone-shaped}} paper <b>cup</b> {{was invented}} in 1908 by Lawrence Luellen, and in 1912 Luellen and Hugh Moore began marketing the Health Kup, another paper <b>disposable</b> <b>cup.</b> The Health Kup was designed to create a means for people to drink water from public water barrels without spreading germs, which occurred when people would use a dipper or their own cup to hold the water. The Health Kup was later renamed to Dixie Cup, and was named after a brand of dolls. Luellen and Moore later developed a disposable paper ice cream cup, which included lids with images of sportspeople, movie stars and animals.|$|R
