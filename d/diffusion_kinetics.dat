To illustrate {{the effectiveness of}} the TSR diagnostics, we study the ignition transient in a non premixed, reaction–diffusion model in the mixture fraction space, whose dependent variables are temperature and mixture composition. The reactive mixture considered is syngas/air. A detailed H 2 /CO mechanism with 12 species and 33 chemical reactions is employed. We will discuss two cases, one involving only kinetics as a model of front propagation purely driven by spontaneous ignition, the other as a model of deflagration wave involving kinetics/diffusion coupling. We explore different aspects of the system dynamics such as the relative role of <b>diffusion</b> and <b>kinetics,</b> the evolution of kinetic eigenvalues, and of the tangential stretching rates computed by accounting for the combined action of <b>diffusion</b> and <b>kinetics</b> as well for kinetics only.

The results presented herein show that this spectroscopic approach can be a versatile and quantitative in situ assay of local oxygen concentrations in such organic semiconductor films. With our current apparatus, the approach has a time resolution of 5 seconds, thereby enabling direct measurement of oxygen <b>diffusion</b> <b>kinetics</b> into a semiconductor film. The versatility of this approach suggests it could be widely applicable to measurement of oxygen diffusion into organic optoelectronic devices, including for example oxygen diffusion through encapsulation and barrier layers.

Fluences of ~ 10 ^ 14 and ~ 10 ^ 16 protons/cm 2 induced 3 He concentrations of ~ 10 ^ 8 and ~ 10 ^ 9 atoms/mg, respectively. Controlled degassing experiments on irradiated samples of terrestrial apatite (Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 F), titanite (Ca(TiO) (SiO 4)), olivine ((Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4), goethite (FeOOH), and quartz (SiO 2) {{demonstrate that the}} proton-induced nuclides are spatially uniform across samples <= 1 mm in diameter and sequential degassing quantifies solid state <b>diffusion</b> <b>kinetics</b> of helium and neon. <b>Diffusion</b> <b>kinetics</b> of proton-induced 3 He in Durango apatite (Ea = 147. 9 ± 1. 3 kJ/mol; ln(Do/a 2) = 16. 0 ± 0. 3 ln(s- 1)) and Fish Canyon tuff titanite (Ea = 183. 7 ± 2. 7 kJ/mol; ln(Do/a 2) = 13. 3 ± 0. 5 ln(s- 1)), are indistinguishable from those determined for natural radiogenic 4 He in the same samples. Experiments indicate that lattice damage potentially introduced via proton irradiation did not significantly modify the natural 4 He <b>diffusion</b> <b>kinetics</b> in the two samples, and that the proton-induced 4 He component is relatively negligible in abundance. Therefore, sequentially measured 4 He/ 3 He ratios reflect the natural spatial distribution of radiogenic 4 He. Combined with a (U-Th) /He age and helium <b>diffusion</b> <b>kinetics,</b> the distribution limits the time-temperature (t-T) path a mineral experienced through geologic time. This {{is the basis for}} a new methodology called 4 He/ 3 He thermochronometry, which for apatite constrains continuous t-T paths between 80 oC and 20 oC. Proton-induced 3 He diffusion parameters in olivine are: Ea = 153. 8 ± 1. 1 kJ/mol and ln(Do/a 2) = 3. 0 ± 0. 2 ln(s- 1). At 25 oC, the helium <b>diffusion</b> <b>kinetics</b> in a goethite sample (Ea = 163 ± 2. 4 kJ/mol; ln(Do/a 2) = 26. 0 ± 0. 6 ln(s- 1)) predict 90 % 4 He retention over 11. 8 Ma, consistent with the observed deficit gas fraction and (U-Th) /He age of 10. 7 Ma.

40|$|We {{performed}} stepwise degassing experiments by heating single crystals of neutron- or proton-irradiated olivine, pyroxene and feldspar {{to study}} <b>diffusion</b> <b>kinetics</b> of neon. This {{is important in}} evaluating the utility of these minerals for cosmogenic 21 Ne measurements and, potentially, for Ne thermochronometry. Degassing patterns are only partially explained by simple Arrhenius relationships; most samples do not exhibit a precisely-determined activation energy in an individual diffusion domain. Regardless, we find clear differences in <b>diffusion</b> <b>kinetics</b> among these minerals. Based on sub-selected data, our estimates for neon <b>diffusion</b> <b>kinetics</b> (activation energy Ea and pre-exponential factor Do, assuming the analyzed fragments approximate the diffusion domain) in each mineral are as follows: for the feldspars, Ea ranges from ! 65 to 115 kJ/mol and D o from 3. 9 x 10 - 3 to 7. 1 x 10 2 cm 2 s - 1; for the pyroxenes, E a ranges from ! 292 to 480 kJ/mol and Do from 1. 6 x 10 2 to 2. 9 x 10 11 cm 2 s - 1; for the olivines, E a ranges from ~ 360 to 370 kJ/mol and D o from 1. 5 x 10 6 to 5. 0 x 10 6 cm 2 s - 1. Differences in these parameters are broadly consistent with the expected effect of structural differences between feldspar, and olivine and pyroxene. These results indicate that cosmogenic 21 Ne will be quantitatively retained within olivine and pyroxene at Earth surface temperatures over geological timescales. The <b>diffusion</b> <b>kinetics</b> for feldspars, on the other hand, predicts that 21 Ne retention at Earth surface temperatures will vary significantly with domain size, crystal microtexture, surface temperature, and exposure duration. Quantitative retention is expected only in favorable conditions.
