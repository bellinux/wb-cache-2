40|$|Common {{blasting}} caps {{are made from}} an aluminum shell {{in the form of}} a tube which is closed at both ends. One end, which is called the output end, terminates in a principal side or face, and contains a <b>detonating</b> <b>agent</b> which communicates with a means for igniting the <b>detonating</b> <b>agent.</b> The improvement of the present invention is a flat, steel foil bonded to the face in a position which is aligned perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the tube...|$|E

50|$|During {{the final}} few beacons, Catalina Thorne hacks into the Agent's comm system and pleads {{with him to}} cease the beacon re-activations, but {{eventually}} is silenced by the Voice of the Agency. After the last beacon is <b>detonated,</b> the <b>Agent</b> must return to the Tower and activate the final beacon: the Tower itself. During the process, ex-agents turned into freaks, which were kept for research, break free and attack the three cores which must be defended by the Agent. After the beacon charges, Catalina herself attacks in a stolen and repainted Agency helicopter, firing at the core.|$|R
5000|$|Tom Clancy's novel Red Storm Rising (1986) depicts two American {{intelligence}} officers watching Alexander Nevsky (on an unauthorized Soviet state television satellite feed) {{on the eve}} of World War III. The officers take note of an improved sound track, as well as the anti-German sentiment and strong sense of Russian (as opposed to Soviet) nationalism. The next day, as part of a plot to split the NATO alliance politically, KGB <b>agents</b> <b>detonate</b> a bomb in the Kremlin and arrest a West German sleeper agent on charges of terrorism.|$|R
2500|$|According to Ojeda's wife, Elma Beatriz Rosado Barbosa, {{as well as}} {{neighbor}} Héctor Reyes, it was the FBI {{agents who}} initiated the shooting at 3:00 pm. The Office of the Inspector General's report stated that an FBI <b>agent</b> <b>detonated</b> a non-lethal [...] "flash bang" [...] grenade outside the house as a diversionary tactic when the FBI approached the house, before any gunfire began, and that Rosado may have thought this explosion was gunfire initiated by the FBI. [...] The FBI press release, however, claims that [...] "as the FBI agents approached {{the front of the}} farm house at approximately 4:28 p.m., [...] Ojeda Ríos opened the front door to the residence and opened fire on the FBI agents. In response to the gunfire from Ojeda Ríos, the FBI returned fire and established a defensive perimeter in order to contain the environment." ...|$|R
50|$|Now {{aware that}} Jack's blood is drawn towards The Blessing, the Torchwood team uses {{small amounts of}} the blood to {{determine}} headings towards the two sites. Rex and Esther contact the CIA for assistance in infiltrating the Buenos Aires site of The Blessing, {{at the same time}} keeping Jack, Gwen, and Oswald's presence in Shanghai a secret. Director Shapiro agrees to the request and puts his team on the task, including Charlotte, who surreptitiously reports the mission to The Three Families. A detachment of the Argentinian Army under the command of Captain Federico Santos soon arrives to assist Rex and Esther, but while the group is loading up, a Three Families double <b>agent</b> <b>detonates</b> a suicide bomb, making the other soldiers Category 1 and destroying Rex and Esther's supply of Jack's blood. Rex, Esther, and Captain Santos survive unharmed, and Rex tells Santos to report that he and Esther were killed in the blast in order to better allow them to infiltrate The Blessing site.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{techniques}} {{for the experimental}} determination of toxic fumes produced by the detonation of high explosives are not applicable to blasting <b>agents.</b> To <b>detonate</b> properly, blasting <b>agents</b> require confinement, a significant booster, charge diameters of 3 inches (7. 5 cm) or greater, and charge lengths greater than two-times the charge diameter. Without these conditions, blasting <b>agents</b> will not <b>detonate</b> at full order, leading to a misrepresentation of the gaseous products. A facility for detonating large, confined charges in a controlled volume has been constructed at the Pittsburgh Research Center 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Experimental Mine. The facility consists of a portion of mine entry (once used for full-scale mine explosion research and demonstrations) enclosed between two explosion proof bulkheads. Total volume of the chamber is 9, 666 ft (274 m). The chamber is equipped with an air circulating system and is 3 3 vented using the mine's airflow. Up to 10 -pound (4. 5 -kg) charges can be detonated in the chamber {{using a variety of}} confinements. For a typical test, the blasting agent is confined in a 4 -inch (10 -cm) schedule 80 steel pipe and initiated by a 3 -inch (7. 5 -cm) diameter, 1 -inch (2. 5 -cm) thick Pentolite booster. This combination of confinement and initiation yields a detonation velocity of about 4, 000 m/sec for ANFO. This velocity is in line with that measured for blasting in the field. Twenty four 2 -inch thick steel plates are suspended around the pipe bomb to stop shrapnel that would otherwise seriously damage the chamber. Following detonation of an explosive in the chamber, a circulating fan is run for about 10 minutes to uniformly mix the chamber atmosphere. Fumes samples are taken out of the chamber through 1 / 4 -inch (0. 6 -cm) Teflon or polyethylene 2 tubes for analysis. The fumes are analyzed using bubblers or Vacutainers to collect samples for analysis by the analytical chemistry lab. The technique described here has been employed to determine the fumes produced by the detonation of a variety of ANFO formulations and commercial explosives. This technique may be developed as a standard test to measure fumes produced by blasting agents or may be used to provide data with which to develop a computer model that will reliably predict the expected fumes production based on chemical composition...|$|R
