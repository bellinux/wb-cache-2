40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium between bulk strain field and interface dislocations in lattice mismatched semiconducting single heterostructures, is calculated {{in a completely}} solvable two-dimensional model, thanks to a choice of simple physical boundary conditions. The model clearly exhibits a phase transition at a critical misfit or a critical thickness of the epilayer, and allows to separate out from the elastic energy, the core contribution which is left, next, as a parameter. Through a carefull comparison with van <b>der</b> <b>Merwe's</b> and Matthews and Blakeslee's approaches, {{it is found that}} all of them turn out to lead to almost identical results. It follows that the widespread agreement of Matthews' theory with number of experimental data holds for all equilibrium theories, and in particular, the present one, as well. The remaining strong discrepancies, on the other hand, are admittedly ascribed to metastable behaviour in growing processes...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} report examines two novels, Carel van <b>der</b> <b>Merwe’s</b> No Man’s Land (2007) and Heinrich Troost’s Plot Loss (2007) {{as examples of}} what {{can be thought of as}} a ‘new wave’ of white writing in South African fiction. The protagonists’ journeys serve to help readers deepen our understanding of white identity in contemporary South Africa, and what the past and the present signify for these white men, by resisting oversimplified or ‘bleached’ representations of whiteness. Recent critical writing has chosen to view emerging texts such as these in a celebratory light. For these critics, the psychological journeys of the characters and shifts in consciousness represented are hopeful, and indicative of a new complexity in writing white male experience in South Africa. The theme of transformation through revisiting the past certainly runs clearly through both texts, but the conclusions of these novels, I will argue, exemplify the paucity of representation that still plagues white male writing in South Afric...|$|R
40|$|This {{commentary}} uses Judge Willem van <b>der</b> <b>Merwe’s</b> rescripting of Rudyard Kipling’s ‘If’ poem {{during the}} Jacob Zuma rape trial {{as a starting}} point to argue for the importance of understanding the ways in which spectres of a colonial, masculinist and racist past continue to haunt the present in South Africa. While Zuma invoked Zulu culture and his duties as a Zulu patriarch in his defence in the trial, this very idea of ‘Zuluness’ {{is a product of the}} same patriarchal racialism disseminated by Kipling and British colonialism. In order to address high levels of sexual violence in contemporary South Africa, the state needs to acknowledge the ways in which a colonial, white supremacist and patriarchal past has shaped responses to sexual violence. It also needs to redress problems of social and economic inequality that exist in South Africa as hangovers from this country’s colonial and apartheid-era past.

25|$|Although {{his overall}} Test batting record was modest, he played some {{important}} innings, none {{more so than}} his 76 during a seventh-wicket partnership of 221 in less than 3 hours with Denis Lindsay in the First Test at Johannesburg in 1966–67. When the two came together South Africa was six wickets down and 223 runs ahead and the match was evenly poised; when the partnership ended, South Africa's lead was virtually unassailable. In the Third Test of the same series another partnership with Lindsay took South Africa from 94 for 6 in the first innings to 197 for 7; van <b>der</b> <b>Merwe</b> scored 42, and again led South Africa to victory. In the Second Test in 1965 a partnership of 98 with Graeme Pollock rescued South Africa in the first innings from 80 for 5; van <b>der</b> <b>Merwe</b> made 38, and South Africa won the match by 94 runs.|$|E

ABSTRACT:A study of the Atterberg Limits of different clays {{has shown that the}} ratio of Liquid limit to Plastic limit defines the type of clay present in a soil. This ratio R (or plasticity ratio) is shown to be related exponentially to Skempton’s Activity. The clay fraction within a given soil can now be estimated without any hydrometer analysis. Van <b>der</b> <b>Merwe’s</b> zones of swell potential have been mathematically defined and a chart giving the swell potential of a soil from the value of R and P 425 fraction is presented.
