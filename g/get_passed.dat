5|$|In {{common with}} most canals, {{competition}} from railways posed a major threat, and in 1845 the canal owners {{agreed to sell}} it to the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway when their line from Ambergate to Grantham was opened. Although the railway was completed in 1850, the railway company did not honour the agreement. The canal company brought a large number of cases against the railway company, and successfully opposed several bills which the railway were trying to <b>get</b> <b>passed</b> in Parliament. Eventually the railway company agreed to pay, and shareholders received £45 per share in cash, with the balance being in railway mortgages. The agreement was reached on 1 June 1854, and the transfer of ownership took place on 20 December. Railway mergers meant that the canal came {{under the control of the}} Great Northern Railway in 1861, and later the London and North Eastern Railway.|$|E

The then Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, stated: [...] "The rapists should be hanged". Sonia Gandhi visited the Safdarjang Hospital and met doctors on duty in the anaesthesia and surgery departments for {{an update on the}} woman's health. Bahujan Samaj Party chief, Mayawati, said that proper investigation was required, and that [...] "action should be so strict that no one should dare to act in such a manner again". Actress and member of the Rajya Sabha, Jaya Bachchan said that she was [...] "terribly disturbed" [...] over the incident, and felt [...] "ashamed" [...] sitting in the House, feeling [...] "helpless" [...] for [...] "not being able to do anything". Meira Kumar, Speaker of the Lok Sabha, told reporters a [...] "new law should be brought in and must <b>get</b> <b>passed</b> {{to ensure the safety of}} women."

In Scotty's case, {{it created a}} seeming continuity discrepancy, given Scotty's dialogue in the TNG episode [...] "". In that episode, Scotty implied that he believed Kirk to be still alive, although the scene's setting was after Scotty had witnessed Kirk's apparent death in Star Trek: Generations. The official explanation for the inconsistency is that Scotty was disoriented in [...] "Relics" [...] after being kept alive in a transporter loop.

When Goldberg arrived on set on her first day, she immediately asked to see Nichelle Nichols, who portrayed Uhura in The Original Series. When told that Nichols was not in the film, she said to Koenig [...] "The fans have been waiting for years to see Nichelle and me and Uhura and Guinan on screen together." [...] Patrick Stewart said that he had made an effort to ensure that the original cast were involved in the film, saying [...] "I've been passionate about that from {{the first time that a}} Next Generation movie had been mentioned, I didn't want us to sail into the future just as The Next Generation cast." ...|$|E

2500|$|Norwegian singer Sondre Lerche covered [...] "Countdown" [...] in December 2011 as a [...] "Christmas gift" [...] and his {{favorite}} {{song of the}} year. He further stated, [...] "I took the liberty of making some gender-oriented changes to the lyrics to better accommodate my macho-persona... That being said, {{the trick is to}} <b>get</b> <b>passed</b> the novelty-factor and just sing a beautiful song at the best of your abilities. Obviously, a significant part of this song's appeal and ecstatic energy comes from the dizzying vocal performance and the mind-blowingly cool production work — elements and talents useless to even attempt replicating (especially not in my father in-law's basement). But as long as there's a song underneath, there's a way." [...] His cover of the song contains his vocals and mild acoustic guitar strumming, which according to Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine gives [...] "an approach that puts the focus on the track's stellar songwriting". According to Mallika Rao of The Huffington Post, [...] "Sondre Lerche made us a gift... and probably because he's a talented, popular, professional musician, it's really good". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound praised the cover, saying: [...] "The end result is a simple track, without pomp or circumstance or the crazy marching band, where Lerche is able to replicate not the high-energy feel, but the song's simple message of love and dedication. Thanks to its minimalist nature, the track isn't a corny display of pop mockery, but a demonstration of how universal great music can be." ...|$|E

There can't be anything impossible in it, Alexis. We know that travellers have made their way through Africa alone. Mungo Park did, and lots of other people have done so, and some of the negro tribes are, according to all accounts, a deal more savage than the Asiatic tribes.

Do not say you cannot protest where the lives of men are concerned; say rather, you desire their death. Say rather, you hold it good for Florence that there shall be more blood and more hatred.

6000|$|... "Well, lad, if {{you have}} quite made up your mind about it, my advice would be, do not try here. In London they {{are a lot more}} {{particular}} than they are down in the country, and I should say you are a good deal more likely to rub through at Aldershot or Canterbury than you would be here. They are more particular here. You see, they have no great interest in filling up the ranks of a regiment, while {{when you go to the}} regiment itself, the doctors and officers and all of them like seeing it up to its full strength, so their interest is to pass a recruit if they can.

One man gets promoted and another doesn't, and he hopes that luck will come his way next time.

There would be nothing to say against that if, as in your honour's case, a man was chosen for the staff because he had done something that showed that he was fit for it. But it isn't so here. If a man belongs to a good family, and has interest, he gets a good appointment; and it is mighty seldom that a man is taken from his regiment, and put on to the staff, because he has done something which showed he was a good soldier." ...|$|E
