5|$|Details on {{reversing}} warfarin {{are provided}} in clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians.

5|$|In many organisms, inhibitors may act {{as part of}} a {{feedback}} mechanism. If {{an enzyme}} produces too much of one substance in the organism, that substance may act as an inhibitor for the enzyme {{at the beginning of the}} pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance to slow down or stop when there <b>is</b> <b>sufficient</b> amount. This is a form of negative feedback. Major metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle make use of this mechanism.|$|E

50|$|Satisfying all ten {{criteria}} would <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> for art, {{as might}} any subset formed by nine criteria (this {{is a consequence}} of the fact that none of the ten properties is necessary). For example, consider two of Gaut’s criteria: “possessing aesthetic merit” and “being expressive of emotion” (200, p. 28). Neither of these criteria is necessary for art status, but both are parts of subsets of these ten criteria that <b>are</b> <b>sufficient</b> for art status. Gaut’s definition also allows for many subsets with less than nine criteria to <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> for art status, which leads to a highly pluralistic theory of art.|$|R

5|$|A 2016 phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{conducted by}} Sachs et al. found two equally strong alternative placements of Brancasaurus (including Gronausaurus): within the Leptocleididae; {{or as the}} sister taxon of a clade containing both Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae, with the clade containing all of the aforementioned taxa being the sister taxon of Elasmosauridae. The study concluded that, currently, no phylogenetic dataset <b>is</b> <b>sufficient</b> to resolve the relationships of Brancasaurus. In addition {{to the fact that}} the type specimen is a subadult, this inconsistency in results can be attributed to the mix of leptocleidid, polycotylid, and elasmosaurid characteristics that is seen in Brancasaurus. The cladograms below illustrate the alternate arrangements.|$|E
