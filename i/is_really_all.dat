I have always believed that fantasy, in particular, because it takes place in an imaginary world with at least some imaginary characters, needs to make the reader feel at home in the setting. That means bringing the setting alive for the reader, which is what creating environment as {{a character}} <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> about."

She stated: [...] "(I was) one of those kids... holding everything inside... internalizing everything. And that really can affect you, and feeling helpless and hopeless, and finding that person that you can trust, that adult, like I did later on in life, that I felt comfortable and safe to tell my issues, my worries, my pains, my aches to. This is what the Trevor Project <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> about. And they have a 24-hour hotline... There's someone there that you can speak with 24 hours that will be there for you."

Unless people begin to see through that, to see past it to, what sex <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> about, they're always going to have the same neurotic attitudes. It's very neatly packaged. It all works hand-in-hand with the churches and political leaders at the point, where elections are coming up."

[...] Norwood's contract was once again renewed in late 2013 for another year, by the new executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who promised [...] "juicy storylines" [...] for the character. One source from the programme said [...] "Fatboy is a popular character and appeals to all ages. He's not had a decent storyline for a while but always provides much-needed humour in Albert Square.

However, {{in the absence of}} any official reports on Zhou himself, Chinese and international media became rife with speculation about his fate. At a press conference during the March 2014 national meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a reporter from Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post directly asked the spokesperson if he could provide more information on the rumours circulating about the Zhou Yongkang case. In response, the spokesman chuckled and said, [...] "like you, I've seen some stories on a select few media outlets," [...] he then recited a prepared party-line reply, then ended off his response with a smile, [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> I can say in response to your question, I think you know what I mean."

[...] Daniella Graham from Metro.co.uk emphasized the hot pants Minogue wore in the video, and an iconic clothing piece in her career from her single [...] "Spinning Around"; Graham titled their article [...] "Kylie Minogue brings back the hotpants in new Timebomb video". Similar, an editor from The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "he pop princess [...] looks flawless in the new clip, strutting along busy thoroughfares in London's SoHo neighborhood {{in a pair of}} hot pants, before ducking into an alley and stripping down to a barely-there webbed dress." [...] Jenna Rubenstein of MTV said positively, [...] "There may not be much of a plot, but there's a ton of almost-naked Kylie, which <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> we were hoping for anyway."

2500|$|The San Francisco Chronicles Peter Hartlaub {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review. He said, [...] "It doesn't go much of anywhere until the infuriating last 10 minutes, {{when everything is}} sort of tied together while still producing more unanswered questions. The movie seems at times to be told in random order, often with flashbacks, and {{the closest thing to}} a plot is a weak story about the father who keeps confronting the people responsible for his son's drunken-driving death". He pointed out the lack of realism in the script, saying [...] "One incredibly large and intricate torture device in this movie couldn't have been made without four or five subcontractors, but we're supposed to believe a mentally unbalanced ex-junkie who weighs 100 pounds put it together in, at most, a few months". Michael Ordoña of the Los Angeles Times said that [...] "More gore <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> Saw III has to offer", saying that [...] "the first few minutes cram in more graphic brutality than you can shake a bloody, pointed stick at". He listed other problems being [...] "flat dialogue, uninvolving characters and a creeping sameness in the no-brain- required puzzles". He concluded his review saying, [...] "Bottom line, those in the Saw factory know their audience and have brought along the appropriate buckets and bibs. Even devotees, however, may note pacing problems and tire of Jigsaw's selective omnipotence (he can acquire copious amounts of deadly nerve agent but not a bottle of Ativan?). Those who see Saw III are in for ups and downs".|$|E
2500|$|What was an [...] "enclos paroissial" [...] {{was hit by}} bombing {{during the}} 1944 Liberation of France and the Calvary <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> that is left. The parish church of Saint-Pierre, which had been built in 1870 to replace the {{existing}} 17th-century church, was left in ruins and ultimately rebuilt in 1950. The Calvary had been built between 1602 and 1604 to {{mark the end of}} the bubonic plague epidemic of 1598 and has been classified as a [...] "monument historique" [...] since 1889. The Calvary stands in the centre of Plougastel-Daoulas, just by the parish church. The name of the Calvary in Breton translates as the [...] "Cross of the Plague". It was on 23 August 1944 that the area was bombarded by the American forces as they advanced towards Brest. Several of the statues on the Calvary were badly damaged, as were the three crosses. John D. Skilton, an Army Officer and a curator at the Washington Museum in civilian life, was in Plougastel-Daoulas {{at the time of the}} bombing, saw the damage done and resolved to restore the Calvary. When back in the USA, he formed the [...] "Plougastel Calvary Restoration Fund Inc" [...] to raise the funds needed for the Calvary's restoration and, sufficient funds having been raised, the restoration started in 1949 under the direction of the Ministère des Beaux-Arts et des Monuments Historiques who used the services of the sculptor Millet. Further restoration was carried out between 2003 and 2004. The Calvary is 10 metres high. The various scenes depicted are arranged along the lines of the cardinal points. The scenes relating to the birth of Christ and his burial are grouped on the eastern side, whilst on the northern side are scenes dealing with Christ's suffering. On the southern side the scenes deal with Passover, (the [...] "Last supper"), Jesus' washing of Peter's feet and the [...] "chemin de croix" [...] (the path to Calvary). On the western side we encounter scenes of Christ's death and resurrection.|$|E
