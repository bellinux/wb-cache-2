On May 8, 2013, Hong Soon-seok(a Kyunggi provincial {{vice chairman of the}} UPP) gave a guideline to Han Dong-geun(a former Suwon city chairman of the UPP), urging him to break and swallow USB drives in case of emergency like investigators' raid. There is also an instruction for escape, under which RO members <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a hiding place of their own and always possess 100 thousand Korean won in cash. They were also told to evade the investigators' chase by fleeing and exchanging secret passwords when reconnecting a RO member.|$|E
25|$|The {{unemployment}} benefit should be increased and {{limited to one}} year. In this period, people would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a job or education. If {{at the end of}} the year one should not succeed in finding a job, the government will offer one a job for the minimum wage. In order to create more employment, they want to implement the green tax shift which will lower taxes on lower paid labour. This would be compensated by higher taxes on pollution. In order to increase prospects for the underprivileged, it wants to invest in education, especially the vmbo (middle-level vocational education). In order to ensure that migrants have a better chance for jobs, it wants to deal firmly with discrimination, especially on the labour market. The party wants to decrease income differences by making child benefits. The party favours reform of government pensions: after 45 years of employment one should get the right to a pension. If one starts working young, one is able to stop working earlier than if one starts working when one is older. Receiving unemployment or disability benefits is counted as work, as is caring for children or family members. The system of mortgage interest deductions should be abolished over a forty-year period.|$|E
500|$|Ayola {{has since}} {{explained}} that her {{change of heart}} stemmed from becoming a mother. In {{the early years of}} her marriage to fellow actor Adam Smethurst the couple struggled financially, and with the added expense of the birth of their daughter, Ayola had been on the verge of giving up her acting career to begin a business franchise. [...] On joining the cast of Holby City, she disclosed: [...] "I've been someone who's loved the uncertainty of acting. I've loved that one month it's Sahara in Morocco and the next I'm doing a stage play, then it's a six-part telly thing. But last summer I started thinking it would be really nice not to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a job every couple of weeks. It would be nice just to stay put for a while. If I'm going to be a working mum I'd rather just be one rather than be one intermittently. And then Holby came along, so I'm very grateful." ...|$|E

500|$|Other critics, however, {{disliked the}} novel. The Nation critic {{believed}} Hemingway's hard-boiled style was {{better suited to}} the short stories published in In Our Time than his novel. Writing in the New Masses, Hemingway's friend John Dos Passos asked: [...] "What's the matter with American writing these days?.... The few unsad young men of this lost generation will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> another way of finding themselves than the one indicated here." [...] Privately he wrote Hemingway an apology for the review. The reviewer for the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote of the novel, [...] "The Sun Also Rises {{is the kind of}} book that makes this reviewer at least almost plain angry." [...] Some reviewers disliked the characters, among them the reviewer for The Dial, who thought the characters were shallow and vapid; and The Nation and Atheneum deemed the characters boring and the novel unimportant. The reviewer for The Cincinnati Enquirer wrote of the book that it [...] "begins nowhere and ends in nothing." ...|$|E

She was approached about returning to the show in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin. After {{a series of three}} meetings, a year after the birth of her first child, she agreed to assume the role of Kyla, despite being [...] "nervous about signing such a long contract", stating: [...] "I've been someone who's loved the uncertainty of acting.

500|$|In December 2004, Domínguez made {{international}} headlines {{when she}} signed a two-year contract for second division men's team, Atlético Celaya, in Guanajuato, Mexico. Domínguez {{said of the}} signing, [...] "The thing is, that in Mexico we don't have even a decent amateur league for women, so you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> other options... I knew that the decision could go either way, but were expecting a yes. The hard {{thing is going to}} be equaling the physical force of the men, but the technique, the desire, the willpower, those are things that I already have." [...] While the Mexican Football Association did not object, they deferred to FIFA headquarters in Zurich for an official ruling. FIFA ruled against mixed-sex football teams stating, [...] "There must be a clear separation between men's and women's football." [...] Furthermore, a ban was placed on Domínguez for playing in an exhibition game outside the league but still alongside men. [...] "I just wanted to be given the chance to try," [...] Domínguez said. [...] "If I failed I would have been the first to say I can't do it, the first to admit it doesn't work. But at least I would have tried." ...|$|E

2500|$|Of all {{the players}} on the Dodgers roster, general manager Bavasi {{believed}} that the key Dodger of the upcoming 1961 season was Demeter, expecting Don to make a large comeback after his disappointing outing last season. [...] "If Don can show us the Demeter of early 1959, we won't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> added power. We'll have all we need." [...] It was announced on February 14, 1961, that Demeter had signed his new yearly contract with the Dodgers for around $16,000. However, Don would have stiff competition to regain his starting role in center field. Newcomer Willie Davis, coming off a huge season in the Pacific Coast League and last season's number one player of the year as named by The Sporting News, was considered a serious threat to take Demeter's job. By the start of the season, Demeter had his role reduced to coming off the bench.|$|E

The canopy {{work of the}} choir of Winchester contains exquisite carvings of oak and other leaves. The choir stalls of Ely and Chichester and the tomb of Edward III. in Westminster Abbey are all fine examples of this period. Exeter boasts a throne that of Bishop Stapledon (1308–1326) standing [...] high, which remains unequaled for perfection of proportion and delicacy of detail. In France the stalls of St Benoit-sur-Loire, Lisieux, and Évreux are good 14th-century examples. But little Gothic work is now {{to be seen in}} the churches of this country. It is to the museums we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> traces of the old Gothic carvers. The two retables in Dijon Museum, the work of Jacques de Baerze (1301), a sculptor of Flanders, who carved for Philippe le Hardi, Duke of Burgundy, are masterpieces of design and workmanship. The tracery is of the very finest, chiefly gilt on backgrounds of diapered gesso.|$|E

2500|$|Powell {{described}} {{joining the}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) during college {{as one of}} the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had [...] "found himself." [...] According to Powell: It was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what you really <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.|$|E
2500|$|On February 21, 2006, {{the newly}} elected Dover Area School Board voted, {{unanimously}} with one abstention, to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages due to the parents and their lawyers {{as a result of}} the verdict in the case, a large sum of money for a small district. The previous school board had been offered the opportunity to rescind its policy, and avoid paying legal fees, immediately after the lawsuit was filed in 2004, but it declined. The parents' attorneys Pepper Hamilton stated that court records would show that they were entitled to more than $2 million, but were going to accept less than half that amount in recognition of the small size of the school district, and because the school board that voted for the policy had been voted out of office, leaving the new school board [...] "having the bill placed in their laps." [...] The previous school board had been defended without charge by the Thomas More Law Center. Richard Katskee, assistant legal director for Americans United, said of the trial's cost, [...] "Any board thinking of trying to do what the Dover board did is going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a bill in excess of $2 million," [...] and [...] "I think $2 million is a lot to explain to taxpayers for a lawsuit that should never be fought." ...|$|E
