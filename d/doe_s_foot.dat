40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of Metsuke on judo {{throwing}} techniques. Metsuke is a term in Budo, which means how to pay attention to the opponent. Two kinds of Metsuke were employed in the experiments. One of the Metsuke was to pay attention to the whole of the opponent putting the center of the view to the opponent 2 ̆ 7 s chest, and the other was to pay close attention to the opponent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot.</b> Speed and sense of the throwing techniques were analyzed between the two Metsuke.

Five-point rating scales evaluated sense of the throwing techniques, which was strength and uncomfortable feeling. Participants were skillful judo players who participated in the national collegiate judo championships.
