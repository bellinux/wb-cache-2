We proposed a new routing mechanism for a wireless ad-hoc network composed of nodes equipped with multiple network interfaces.

Based on the obtained information, a source node determines a <b>logical</b> <b>path</b> with the maximum available bandwidth to satisfy application-level QoS requirements. In this paper, we evaluated feasibility of the proposal through simulation and practical experiments and confirmed that our proposal effectively transferred multimedia packets over a <b>logical</b> <b>path</b> avoiding congested links.

40|$|Discrete multitone is {{a popular}} {{discrete}} Fourier transform based implementation of multicarrier modulation for wireline communications. This paper examines {{the performance of a}} complex-tap filter bank structure for channel equalization in discrete multitone modulation systems. The structure under study passes the received signal through a number of <b>logical</b> <b>paths.</b> Each path takes care of one data carrying subcarrier. More specifically, each path cascades a finite impulse response frequency selective equalizer and a Goertzel filter computing a single point discrete Fourier transform. The delay on each <b>logical</b> <b>path</b> is individually optimized for best performance. In the presented simulations testing achievable bit rate on an asymmetric digital subscriber line transceiver, the filter bank appears to benchmark the bit rate performance among existing discrete multitone equalization methods. An iterative training procedure, which depends on the second-order statistics of the input and output sequences, is proposed to show the achievablity of performance. 1...|$|R
