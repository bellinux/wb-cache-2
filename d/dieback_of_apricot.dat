Recently, however, another fungus, Eutypa armeniacae (imperfect stage: Cytosporina), was shown to cause the cankers and dieback symptoms previously associated with “dead arm. ” Eutypa dieback has been reported on grapes from several regions of the world and is also an important disease <b>of</b> <b>apricot.</b> Phomopsis viticola is still recognized as the cause of cane and leaf spot and occasional fruit rot...|$|R

This study demonstrated heavy metals led to a significant decrease pollen germination and tube growth <b>of</b> <b>apricot</b> and cherry. There was a reduction in pollen germination and tube elongation as metal concentrations increased. Cu had the highest toxic effect on pollen <b>of</b> <b>apricot</b> while Pb had the least effect.

40|$|The quality <b>of</b> <b>apricots</b> {{today is}} very poor {{due to the}} {{distribution}} system. The longer the distribution time, the worse is the quality.

40|$|Quality <b>of</b> ripened <b>apricot</b> {{depends on}} its {{maturity}} at harvest which was determined in the past subjectively and based on visual ratings. We have explored in this paper the feasibility of two novel nondestructive techniques for rapid quality measurement <b>of</b> <b>apricot</b> and determination <b>of</b> optimal harvest date: acoustic impulse response technique for firmness and reflectance spectroscopy for fruit color. The color parameters L*, a*, b* <b>of</b> freshly harvested <b>apricots</b> ranging from immature to over mature were measured using HunterLab Mini Scan XE Plus spectrophotometer. Among colour parameters CIELAB, a* and hº value are feasible indicators for distinguish different maturity stage <b>of</b> <b>apricot</b> fruit.
