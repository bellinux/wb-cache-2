25|$|I {{have been}} a Catholic and an infidel; I {{have been a}} Roman priest and a hypocrite; I have been a profligate under a cowl. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>that</b> Father Achilli, who as early as 1826, was {{deprived}} of my faculty to lecture, for an offence which my superiors {{did their best to}} conceal; and who in 1827 had already earned the reputation of a scandalous friar. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>that</b> Achilli, who in the diocese of Viterbo in February, 1831, robbed of her honour a young women of eighteen; who in September 1833, was found guilty of a second such crime, {{in the case of a}} person of twenty-eight; and who perpetrated a third in July, 1834, in the case of another aged twenty-four. I am he, who afterwards was found guilty of sins, similar or worse, in other towns of the neighbourhood. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>that</b> son of St. Dominic who is known to have repeated the offence at Capua, in 1834 or 1835; and at Naples again, in 1840, in the case of a child of fiteen. I am he who chose the sacristy of the church for one of these crimes, and Good Friday for another. Look on me, ye mothers of England, a confessor against Popery, for ye 'ne'er may look upon my like again.' <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>that</b> veritable priest, who, after all this, began to speak against, not only the Catholic faith, but the moral law, and perverted others by my teaching. I am the Cavaliere Achilli, who then went to Corfu, made the wife of a tailor faithless to her husband, and lived publicly and travelled about with the wife of a chorus-singer. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>that</b> Professor of the Protestant College at Malta, who with two others was dismissed from my post for offences which the authorities cannot get themselves to describe. And now attend to me, such as I am, and you shall see what you shall see about the barbarity and profligacy of the Inquisitors of Rome.|$|E

25|$|Mendoza {{has been}} {{maintaining}} a personal blog since 2012 and she revealed in April 2017 {{that she is}} planning to release a book {{in the latter part}} of 2017 and her blog is one of her inspirations in writing the book. According to her, the book, which will focus on her personal life, will have no ghostwriters as she will personally write the book herself. In October 2017, her first autobiographical book entitled Yup, <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>That</b> Girl was published by Summit Media and was launched on October 26, 2017. The book's title is based on her Twitter account's bio. After the book launching was declared, the #YupIAmThatGirl trended on Twitter and book authors Lang Leav and Michael Faudet reacted positively to Mendoza's book. Her book was already sold out in just four hours after a bookstore announced its availability.|$|E

It is possible that he was originally buried in the chancel of the Carmelite friary, as he requested, but was re-interred in the nave of St Nicholas at the Dissolution. A number of other stones carry standard tags in Latin or English requesting prayers or simply stating the identity of the internee, but Sir John Smyth's 1460 memorial enjoined [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>that</b> shall you be, Pray for the sowle of me".|$|E
500|$|Except for {{the short}} film <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>That</b> Change whose music was {{composed}} by Sai Karthik, Sukumar chose Devi Sri Prasad to compose the soundtrack and background score for the films he directed. Sukumar worked with cinematographer R. Rathnavelu for Arya, Jagadam, and 1: Nenokkadine. When Raju asked Sukumar about the budget to be allotted to Arya, Sukumar said that he first wants Rathnavelu on board. In an interview to The Hindu in March 2012, Rathnavelu said, [...] "Sukumar's speciality is he can give you five different ways to solve every problem you encounter. He {{can get to the}} crux of the problem and figure out the best possible method to resolve it". Because of their friendship with Sukumar, neither Rathnavelu nor Prasad charged any remuneration for his maiden production venture Kumari 21F. For Arya 2, he collaborated with R. D. Rajasekhar. He worked with Venkat R. Prasad and Vijay C Chakravarthy for 100% Love and Nannaku Prematho respectively.|$|E
500|$|After {{writing and}} {{directing}} a short film <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>That</b> Change produced by Allu Arjun, Sukumar provided {{the story and}} screenplay for Kumari 21F, his maiden feature film as a co-producer which was directed by his assistant Palnati Surya Pratap. He took inspiration from his college days in Razole where a young woman went to a picnic with some young men; a major undertaking for {{a woman at the}} time. Rumours were spread and the woman was labelled as a [...] "loose" [...] character, which stayed in Sukumar's mind. Produced on a budget of 60150 million, Kumari 21F grossed 380 million and became the 12th highest grossing Telugu film of the year. Siddharth Rao of The Times of India stated, [...] "In an industry where a damsel-in-distress-wooed-and-saved-by-an-angry-young-man is the norm, this is refreshing. Kudos to the writer Sukumar for giving yet another off-beat story with characters that can't be put into a box".|$|E

500|$|Babayane and Mshete {{had arrived}} back in Bulawayo in August, {{accompanied}} by Maund, and Lobengula had immediately written again to Whitehall, reaffirming that [...] "If the Queen hears that I have given away the whole country, {{it is not}} so." [...] But this letter only reached the Colonial Office in London in late October, too late to make a difference. Meanwhile, the British appointed an official resident in Bulawayo, as Lobengula had requested; much to the king's indignation, it was Moffat. Maund counselled Lobengula that the concession was legal beyond doubt {{and that he would}} just have to accept it. Lobengula rued the situation to Helm: [...] "Did you ever see a chameleon catch a fly? The chameleon gets behind the fly and remains motionless for some time, then he advances very slowly and gently, first putting forward one leg and then another. At last, when well within reach, he darts out his tongue and the fly disappears. England is the chameleon and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>that</b> fly." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{opened with}} [...] "Baba O'Riley", {{featuring}} piano and synthesizer-processed Lowrey organ by Townshend. The song's title {{pays homage to}} Townshend's guru, Meher Baba, and minimalist composer Terry Riley (and is informally known as [...] "Teenage Wasteland" [...] from {{a line in the}} lyrics). The organ track came from a longer demo by Townshend, portions of which were later included on a Baba tribute album <b>I</b> <b>Am,</b> <b>that</b> was edited down for the final recording. Townshend later said this part had [...] "two or three thousand edits to it". The opening lyrics to the next track, [...] "Bargain", [...] "I'd gladly lose me to find you", came from a phrase used by Baba. Entwistle wrote [...] "My Wife" [...] after having an argument with his wife and exaggerating the conflict in the lyrics. The track features several overdubbed brass instruments recorded in a single half-hour session. [...] "Pure and Easy", a key track from Lifehouse, did not make the final track selection, but the opening line was included as a coda to [...] "The Song is Over".|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{featured}} {{the first in}} a string of guest appearances by actor Rob Lowe, who had recently departed from the ABC drama series Brothers & Sisters. As a joke, Rob Lowe's credit during the opening credits reads [...] "and introducing Rob Lowe". Unlike Scott, Lowe was originally not expected to join the regular cast, but rather make guest appearances in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] and six third season episodes before departing the show. However, after those episodes were filmed, Lowe later joined the show as a regular cast member. Lowe said he loved playing the part, which he described as [...] "a big fat nerd" [...] and [...] "the most positive person in the world [...] unrelenting enthusiasm", adding, [...] "He is also very, very intense and specific. So whether he's ordering how he would like his water or describing the kind of colors he wants on a graph, everything means the world to him." [...] Throughout the episode, whenever he meets someone new, Chris Traeger points directly at their face and slowly repeats their name. Schur said this habit was the first element the writers conceived for the character. In one line of the episode, while describing his exercise regimen and supplements, [...] "Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born. I believe <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>that</b> human being." [...] That line was inspired by Schur's wife, J. J. Philbin, who had recently read an article about that scientific prediction and felt it applied to the character. Parks and Recreation was suffering in the Nielsen ratings when [...] "The Master Plan" [...] aired, and it was hoped Lowe's appearance would help increase viewership. Lowe's performance was heavily publicized in advance of the episode's original broadcast.|$|E

2500|$|In Protestant commentaries it {{is often}} stated that [...] "whenever John reports Jesus as saying ego eimi, a claim to deity is implicit."

For example; [...] "These mighty words come from the Greek words ego eimi, which is more accurately translated, [...] "I AM!". This is also found in some Catholic commentaries.

2500|$|In a 1989 {{interview}} with radio host Timothy White, Townshend apparently acknowledged his bisexuality, referencing the song [...] "Rough Boys" [...] on his 1980 album, Empty Glass. He called the song a [...] "coming out, {{an acknowledgment of}} the fact that I'd had a gay life, and that I understood what gay sex was about." [...] However, in a 1994 interview for Playboy, he said, [...] "I did an interview about it, saying that [...] "Rough Boys" [...] was about being gay, and in the interview I also talked about my [...] "gay life," [...] which—I meant—was actually about the friends I've had who are gay. So the interviewer kind of dotted the t's and crossed the i's and assumed that this was a coming out, which it wasn't at all." [...] Townshend later wrote in his 2012 autobiography Who <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>that</b> he at one point felt as if he was [...] "probably bisexual". Townshend also stated jokingly that he once felt sexually attracted to The Rolling Stones lead singer, Mick Jagger.|$|E

Attiya's efforts to convince the father of the importance of Torah learning fell on deaf ears. The next morning, when the father entered his store, he found Attiya standing there wearing a work apron. The rosh yeshiva explained that he had come to the store early that morning when Ovadia was opening up. He had told the boy that he had found a substitute worker who would work without pay, and sent him back to yeshiva. [...] "You said that you needed someone to help and could not afford to pay. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>that</b> someone. Your son's learning is more important than my time!"
