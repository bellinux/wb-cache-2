5000|$|Rotary kilns {{started to}} be used for lime {{manufacture}} {{at the start of the}} 20th century and now account for a large proportion of new installations if energy costs are less important. The early use of simple rotary kilns had the advantages that a much wider range of limestone size could be used, from fines upwards, and undesirable elements such as sulfur can be removed. On the other hand, fuel consumption was relatively high because of poor heat exchange compared with shaft kilns, leading to excessive heat loss in exhaust gases. Old fashioned [...] "long" [...] rotary kilns operate at 7 to 10 MJ/kg. Modern installations partially overcome this disadvantage by adding a preheater, which has the same good solids/gas contact as a shaft kiln, but fuel consumption is still somewhat higher, typically in range of 4.5 to 6 MJ/kg. In the design shown, a circle of shafts (typically 8-15) is arranged around the kiln riser duct. Hot limestone is discharged from the shafts in sequence, by the action of a hydraulic [...] "pusher plate". Kilns of 1000 tonnes per day output are typical. The rotary kiln is the most flexible of any lime kilns able to produce soft, medium, or hard burned as well as dead-burned lime or <b>dolime.</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{production}} of magnesium metal from the Zefreh dolomite ore of Central Iran using the Pidgeon process. The investigation consisted of mineralogical and chemical characterization of the dolomite ore, calcining, chemical characterization, LOI (loss on ignition) determination, reduction tests on the calcined dolomite (<b>dolime),</b> using Iranian (Semnan) ferrosilicon and mineralogical, and chemical characterization of the reactants and products. Calcining of dolomite samples was carried out at approximately 1400 C in order to remove CO 2, moisture, and other easily volatilized impurities. The <b>dolime</b> was then milled, along with ferrosilicon, thoroughly mixed, and briquetted. The briquettes were heated at 1125 C– 1150 C and 500 Pa in a tube reactor for 10 – 12 hours to extract the magnesium. The ferrosilicon to <b>dolime</b> ratio was determined based on the chemical analyses of the two reactants, using as a guide, and Mintek’s Pyrosim software package. Magnesium extraction varied with ferrosilicon addition and with the <b>dolime</b> used, and reach about 80 % under optimal conditions.

40|$|The present work {{is focused}} on {{thermochemical}} energy storage (TCES) in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants {{by means of the}} Calcium-Looping (CaL) process using cheap, abundant and non-toxic natural carbonate minerals. CaL conditions for CSP storage involve calcination of CaCO in the solar receiver at relatively low temperature whereas carbonation of CaO is carried out at high temperature and high CO concentration to use the heat of reaction for power production by means of a CO closed power cycle. Under these conditions, large CaO particles derived from limestone to be used in industrial processes are rapidly deactivated due to pore-plugging, which limits the extent of the reaction. This is favored by the relatively small pores of the CaO skeleton generated by low temperature calcination, the large thickness of the CaCO layer built upon the CaO surface and the very fast carbonation kinetics. On the other hand, at CaL conditions for CSP storage does not limit carbonation of CaO derived from dolomite (<b>dolime).</b> <b>Dolime</b> is shown to exhibit a high multicycle conversion regardless of particle size, which is explained by the presence of inert MgO grains that allow the reacting gas to percolate inside the porous particles.

40|$|Primary {{magnesium}} is nowadays {{produced in}} China via Pidgeon process. An important {{reaction in the}} process is silicothermic reduction of MgO from <b>dolime</b> near 1200 ºC under pressure of 2 - 10 Pa to generate Mg vapor. Fluorite, ranging 2 - 3 % (mass fraction), is usually mixed with the raw materials to catalyze the reaction. Under the process conditions, CaF 2 in the fluorite may form some fluorides to vaporize, thus polluting air. The fluorides remaining in the solid process waste, the Mg slag, may be dissolved to cause water pollution. In the present study, experiments were performed by using retorts of pilot scale in a maffle furnace to simulate the Pidgeon process for primary Mg production. The test materials, briquettes of 5. 6 - 10 kg made of <b>dolime,</b> ferrosilicon and fluorite, were charged in the retorts and heated under conditions similar to the industry operation. Fluoride minerals in the Mg slag from the simulation experiments were identified by XRD and SEM-EDS techniques. Quantities of some F-containing phases formed in the process under equilibrium condition were calculated by FactSage 6. 2 thermodynamic package. Fluoride distributions were determined to establish an F-balance among the input and output materials. Besides, slag samples from a magnesium plant were also characterized, including leaching test according to EN 12457 - 2. Based on these results, fluoride impacts on the environment were evaluated and discussed. Suggestions were also presented to minimize the environmental impacts from primary Mg production using the Pidgeon process. Godkänd; 2012; 20120410 (yang...|$|E
40|$|A {{small-scale}} testwork {{program was}} carried out in order to investigate certain aspects of thermal extraction of magnesium at atmospheric pressure. Two series of tests were performed in a 100 kVA DC open-arc furnace using <b>dolime</b> or magnesia as the sources of magnesium. In the first series of tests, magnesia-based recipes were charged into the furnace {{at a rate of about}} 3. 5 to 4. 0 kg/h and at temperatures of 1705 to 1872 0 C. Depending on the feed mix, nearly 30 to 40 per cent of the contained magnesium reported to the gas phase, leaving a slag analyzing about 55 to 61 per cent MgO. In the second series of tests, dolime-based feed recipes were reacted at temperatures between 1690 and 1720 0 C and at a feed rate of about 5. 8 kg/h. Depending on the feed recipe, the calculated magnesium extraction ranged from about 80 to 91 per cent, producing a slag containing 5 to 10 per cent MgO...|$|E
40|$|A {{combined}} catalyst and sorbent {{was prepared}} and utilized for steam reforming methane and propane in laboratory-scale systems. The material was prepared {{in the form}} of small spherical pellets having a layered structure such that each pellet consisted of a highly reactive lime or <b>dolime</b> core enclosed within a porous but strong protective shell made of alumina in which a nickel catalyst was loaded. The material served two functions by catalyzing the reaction of hydrocarbons with steam to produce hydrogen while simultaneously absorbing carbon dioxide formed by the reaction. The in situ removal of CO 2 shifted the reaction equilibrium toward increased H 2 concentration and production. The concept was proved by using both a thermogravimetric analyzer and a fixed-bed reactor loaded with the material to reform hydrocarbons. Tests conducted with the fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure and with temperatures in the range of 520 - 650 Â°C produced a product containing a large concentration of H 2 (e. g., 94 - 96 mol %) and small concentration of CO and CO 2. Therefore, the results achieved in a single step were as good as or better than those achieved in a conventional multistep reaction and separation process...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} gene coding for citrate synthase from the gram-positive soil isolate Bacillus sp. strain C 4 (ATCC 55182) capable of secreting acetic acid at pH 5. 0 to 7. 0 {{in the presence}} of <b>dolime</b> has been cloned from a genomic library by complementation of an Escherichia coli auxotrophic mutant lacking citrate synthase. The nucleotide sequence of the entire 3. 1 -kb HindIII fragment has been determined, and one major open reading frame was found coding for citrate synthase (ctsA). Citrate synthase from Bacillus sp. strain C 4 was found to be a dimer (Mr, 84, 500) with a subunit with an Mr of 42, 000. The N-terminal sequence was found to be identical with that predicted from the gene sequence. The kinetics were best fit to a bisubstrate enzyme with an ordered mechanism. Bacillus sp. strain C 4 citrate synthase was not activated by potassium chloride and was not inhibited by NADH, ATP, ADP, or AMP at levels up to 1 mM. The predicted amino acid sequence was compared with that of the E. coli, Acinetobacter anitratum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rickettsia prowazekii, porcine heart, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes...|$|E
40|$|The cement {{industry}} contributes around 5 - 7 % of man-made CO 2 emissions globally {{because of the}} Portland Cement (PC) production. Therefore, innovative reactive magnesia cement, with significant sustainable and technical advantages, has been proposed by blending reactive MgO and hydraulic binders in various proportions. MgO is currently produced from the calcination of magnesite (MgCO 3), emitting more CO 2 than the production of PC, or from seawater/brine which is also extremely energy intensive. Hence this research aims to investigate an innovative method to produce MgO from reject brine, a waste Mg source, through carbon sequestration, by its reaction with CO 2, to provide a comparable low carbon manufacturing process due to the recycling of CO 2. The produced deposits are then calcined to oxides with potential usage in construction industry. The entire system is a closed loop to achieve both environmental optimisation and good productivity. This research focuses on the chemical manufacturing process, integrated with material science knowledge and advancements, instead of concentrating purely on chemistry evaluations. Six series of studies were conducted, utilising MgCl 2, CaCl 2, MgCl 2 -CaCl 2, MgCl 2 -CaCl 2 -NaCl, and MgCl 2 -CaCl 2 -NaCl-KCl to react with CO 2 under alkaline conditions. The precipitates include hydrated magnesium carbonates, calcium carbonates and magnesian calcite. Generated carbonates were then calcined in a furnace to obtain MgO, CaO or <b>dolime</b> (CaO•MgO). All six series of carbonation processes were carried out under a controlled pH level, to study the constant pH’s effect on the process and resulting precipitates. Other controllable factors include pH, temperature, initial concentration, stirring speed, and CO 2 flux rate. In conclusion, the optimum parameters {{for the production of}} the carbonated precipitates are: 0. 25 MgCl 2 + 0. 05 CaCl 2 + 2. 35 NaCl + 0. 05 KCl, 700 rpm stirring speed, 25 oC room temperature, pH= 10. 5, and 500 cm 3 /min CO 2 infusion rate. Reaction time is within a day. These parameters are chosen based on the sequestration level, particle performance morphology and the operational convenience. The optimum calcination parameters are at 800 oC heating temperature with a 4 h retention time...|$|E
