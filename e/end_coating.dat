2500|$|Glass {{containers}} typically receive two surface coatings, {{one at the}} hot end, {{just before}} annealing and one at the cold end just after annealing. At the hot end a very thin layer [...] of tin(IV) oxide is applied either using a safe organic compound or inorganic stannic chloride. Tin based systems {{are not the only}} ones used, although the most popular. Titanium tetrachloride or organo titanates can also be used. In all cases the coating renders the surface of the glass more adhesive to the cold <b>end</b> <b>coating.</b> At the cold end a layer of typically, polyethylene wax, is applied via a water based emulsion. This makes the glass slippery, protecting it from scratching and stopping containers from sticking together when they are moved on a conveyor. The resultant invisible combined coating gives a virtually unscratchable surface to the glass. Due to reduction of in-service surface damage, the coatings often are described as strengtheners, however a more correct definition might be strength-retaining coatings.|$|E

30|$|Optical nanotips {{were first}} {{developed}} as scanning probes in near-field optical microscopes [2]. Such nanoprobes can achieve resolution {{as high as}} λ/ 50, where λ is the wavelength of light [1]. It is important to control aperture size, taper shape, and metal coating to achieve a better performance [13]. The fiber-optic probes were fabricated by laser-heated pulling or chemical etching [14 – 16]. Laser-pulled fiber tips can achieve diameters smaller than 50 nm with small cone angles [14]. Chemical etching tips have larger cone angles and similar apex sizes [15]. However, {{it is often difficult}} to control the etching process. The side of the fiber was further coated with silver, aluminum, or gold films to confine the light [9, 14, 17]. Traditional manufacturing processes still limit the quality of metal-coated fiber probes. Optical throughput of pulled nanoprobes is limited by the sharp taper angle. Chemical-etched tips have higher throughput; however, they do not have a flat distal end as laser-pulled ones which are difficult to form well-defined nanoapertures in shadow evaporation. Moreover, shadow evaporation often leads to either complete or irregular coated tip. Grainy structures of metal thin film increase the distance between the aperture and the sample, which reduce the resolution and intensity. It is also easy to form pin holes at the tapered region that could cause light-leaking. The aperture deviates from ideal circular shape because of grains. A quantitative analysis of probe transmission efficiency becomes difficult. Focused ion beam (FIB) fabrication of nanostructures has been applied on optical fibers for chemical sensing [18]. FIB milling for nanostructure formation allows precise control of size and shape in nanometer accuracy. This paper deals specifically with the metal coating on the formation of nanoaperture at the tip <b>end.</b> <b>Coating</b> materials and angles greatly affect the quality of the nanoprobe. By combining with focused ion beam milling, nanoprobes with well-defined aperture as small as 200 nm have been obtained.

In this work {{we report on the}} leaching of cerium dibutylphosphate, Ce(dbp) 3, from an epoxy coating system as a first step toward a fundamental understanding of the leaching behavior. To this <b>end,</b> <b>coating</b> systems containing various levels of inhibitor loading, ranging from 1 up to 50 wt%, were fabricated. These coatings were characterized using Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTIR), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Leaching experiments were performed by exposing the coating films to water, while the concentration of dissolved Ce(dbp) 3 in this water was monitored in situ using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The leaching of inhibitors showed a clear dependence on the initial inhibitor loading of the coating system. For highly loaded coatings (> 25 wt%) all inhibitors leach out, whereas for a low loading level (< 10 wt%) no leaching was observed. The difference between the high and low loading levels might be the formation of a porous network in the highly loaded coatings due to the dissolution of large Ce(dbp) 3 clusters. Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) we visualized the penetration of a water front into this porous network during the leaching experiments. This water-filled porous network provides an excellent pathway for transport of Ce(dbp) 3. For low levels of inhibitor loadings such a network is absent, and the transport of Ce(dbp) 3 is blocked. The samples containing moderate levels of inhibitor loading showed an increasing amount of leaching for decreasing values of pH. We believe that this pH dependence {{is the result of the}} concurrent leaching of significant amounts of Bisphenol-based coatings residues at low pH since the removal of these residues will also result in an increased porosity of the coating. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Solar lumber drying {{offers several}} {{advantages}} to those desiring an inexpensive means of drying small quantities of lumber. A solar kiln may be easily constructed with readi ly avai lable bui ld ing materials. When {{compared to the}} cost of custom kiln drying, the investment and operating costs of a solar kiln are minimal. When compared to air drying, drying lumber in a solar kiln offers several advantages. A well-designed solar kiln will be 20 to 30 ° F hotter than the outside temperature on sunny days. Thus, solar drying is a much faster process and is capable of drying lumber to moisture contents of 6 to 10 %, particularly in the summer months. It is unusual for air dried lumber to ever reach moisture contents much below 20 % unless it is dried in a heated building. Since solar drying offers protection of the lumber from the elements, the quality of the dry lumber is usually much better than air dried material in terms of seasoning checks and other defects. Solar drying is not without disadvantages. Topmost among these is the method’s dependence upon the weather. Drying rates vary greatly depending upon the outside temperatures and the number of hours of sunshine per day. Lumber dried in 30 days or less during the summer may require an entire winter to dry in a solar kiln. Likewise, {{it is not possible to}} reach the low moisture content (6 - 8 %) desired for furniture making or other quality indoor products by solar drying during inclement seasons of the year. It is also difficult to maintain uniform moisture contents within a charge of solar drying lumber. Thus, it may be advantageous to allow lumber to condition for several weeks in a heated building in order to achieve a desired equilibrium moisture content. There is a greater chance of checking and other seasoning defects with solar drying than with conventional kiln drying. However, defects may be kept to a minimum by following a few simple recommendat ions.

40|$|Companies in the frit, glaze, and {{ceramic colour}} {{producing}} subsector {{know a great}} deal about the different frit-manufacturing process stages such as raw materials milling and mixing, as well as fusing the raw materials mixture to obtain the frit. This knowledge can be used to break new ground in frit applications and to obtain products with high added value, such as bioactive glasses. Bioactive glasses are amorphous materials that are able to interact with bone cells, thanks to surface growth of a hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA) layer when they enter into contact with a biological fluid. This bioactivity, together with their relatively low cost compared to that of the materials used at present, makes such materials particularly attractive for obtaining prosthesis and implant coatings. Among the numerous coating methods, atmospheric plasma spraying is one of the most widely used techniques for industrial-scale deposition of this type of coating owing to its versatility, simplicity, and relatively low cost. This study presents a methodology for obtaining bioactive glass coatings by thermal plasma spraying. The methodology includes: frit synthesis; design, preparation and characterisation of appropriate powders and bioactive glass suspensions for thermal plasma spraying; optimisation of the deposition conditions for the obtainment of coatings from powders as well as from suspensions; and characterisation of the end coatings. It was verified that, after deposition, the resulting coatings exhibited the typical microstructure of layers deposited by thermal plasma spraying. In this case, as feedstock of a glassy nature was involved, the microstructure consisted of a matrix of flattened drops of molten glass, together with rounded pores and cracks. The results obtained also indicated that the amorphous nature of the jetted frit was maintained in the <b>end</b> <b>coating,</b> as was intended. However, low adhesion to the substrate was also observed, it being necessary to use a bonding layer between the substrate and the bioactive glass layer. Consequently, further investigation is needed to improve the bond strength and other properties of these coatings, as well as to evaluate their bioactivity.

Besides, by comparison of the Bragg fiber sensor to a sensor based on a regular multimode fiber with similar outer diameter and length, we find that the Bragg fiber sensor is more sensitive to bending due to presence of mode stripper in the form of the multilayer reflector.
