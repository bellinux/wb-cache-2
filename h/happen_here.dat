He made his Liverpool debut in a league game away to Tottenham Hotspur on 31 August, a game Liverpool won 3–0. Balotelli scored his first Liverpool goal on 16 September, opening a 2–1 Anfield victory against Ludogorets Razgrad in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League. In a match in the same competition on 22 October against Real Madrid, Balotelli was criticised by manager Brendan Rodgers for swapping shirts with opponent Pepe at half time, saying [...] "It's something that doesn't <b>happen</b> <b>here</b> and shouldn't happen here." ...|$|E

500|$|Pet Shop Boys {{released}} a song titled [...] "King's Cross" [...] on the 1987 album Actually and {{the station was}} extensively filmed in for the group's 1988 feature film It Couldn't <b>Happen</b> <b>Here.</b> The band's Neil Tennant explained that the station was a recognisable landmark coming into London, attempting to find opportunities away from the high unemployment areas of Northeast England at the time. The song was primarily about [...] "hopes being dashed" [...] and [...] "an epic nightmare". The group subsequently asked filmmaker Derek Jarman to direct a background video for [...] "King's Cross" [...] for their 1989 tour, which featured {{a black and white}} sequence of juddery camera movements around the local area.|$|E
500|$|Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu called Aagadu a [...] "simple, oft-repeated cop vs. don story", and added, [...] "The {{difference}} {{here is the}} don is reduced to a cardboard. For a mind game to be interesting, both players need to be smart and second guess the opponent’s next move, which doesn’t <b>happen</b> <b>here.</b> If one is looking for gags, Aagadu offers them in plenty. But try an overdose of this formula {{and it could be}} tiring." [...] Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "Though this film has many similarities of Srinu Vaitla’s earlier films, but it’s Mahesh Babu who has the audience’s attention throughout. Watch it for him and more rely on him".|$|E
500|$|Having won both races, Biden made a {{point of}} holding off his {{resignation}} from the Senate so that he could be sworn in for his seventh term on January 6, 2009. [...] He became the youngest senator ever to start a seventh full term, and said, [...] "In all my life, the greatest honor bestowed upon me has been serving the people of Delaware as their United States senator." [...] Biden cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. [...] Biden resigned from the Senate later that day; in emotional farewell remarks on the Senate floor, where he had spent most of his adult life, Biden said, [...] "Every good thing I have seen <b>happen</b> <b>here,</b> every bold step taken in the 36-plus years I have been here, came not from the application of pressure by interest groups, but through the maturation of personal relationships." ...|$|E

500|$|By late June, senior {{counter-terrorism}} official Richard Clarke and CIA director George Tenet were [...] "convinced {{that a major}} {{series of}} attacks was about to come", although the CIA believed that the attacks would likely occur in Saudi Arabia or Israel. In early July, Clarke put domestic agencies on [...] "full alert", telling them that [...] "Something really spectacular is going to <b>happen</b> <b>here...</b> soon." [...] He asked the FBI and the State Department to alert the embassies and police departments, and the Defense Department to go to [...] "Threat Condition Delta." [...] Clarke would later write that [...] "Somewhere in CIA there was information that two known al Qaeda terrorists {{had come into the}} United States... in [...] FBI there was information that strange things had been going on at flight schools in the United States... They had specific information about individual terrorists... None of that information got to me or the White House." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Reiss of Spin {{gave the}} album a mixed review, commenting that [...] "it’s Odd Future at their best, {{blending}} eccentricity, rebellion, and weird humor, with the fearlessness of kids {{convinced that there}} are no consequences to their actions", though noted that [...] "at their worst, they are guilty of every adolescent’s biggest fear - being boring." [...] Ray Rhamen, writer for Entertainment Weekly gave a mixed review, reporting that [...] "robbed of their outsider status, the [...] boys swap horror for hormones on The OF Tape, Vol 2., giddily trading tall tales and witty obscenities. For better or worse, OF might actually be growing up." [...] musicOMH's Andy Baber viewed the album as [...] "an eclectic and solid - if unspectacular - return, which should see their already dedicated fanbase increase", commenting that [...] "Frank Ocean is criminally underused". Mike Madden of Consequence of Sound felt that [...] "too many things <b>happen</b> <b>here,</b> from the Brick Squad-type rave-ups to Ocean's R laments, for it to ever sound like a truly unified, full-length group project." ...|$|E
500|$|Stott withdrew {{support in}} 1970 over the Chowilla Dam, {{a dispute over}} the {{location}} of a dam on the Murray River, and South Australia went to the polls. The dam controversy was not much of an election issue, and attempts by the Democratic Labor Party to portray Dunstan as a communist over his opposition to ongoing Australian support for South Vietnam had little effect. The LCL campaigned heavily on Hall, while Dunstan promised sweeping social reform, artistic transformation and more community services. He said [...] "We'll set a new standard of social advancement that the whole of Australia will envy. We believe South Australia can set the pace. It can <b>happen</b> <b>here.</b> We can do it." [...] Dunstan won the 1970 election easily, taking 27 seats compared with the LCL's 20. Although the share of the votes had been similar to 1968, the dilution of the Playmander had changed the share of the seats. As Labor had attained a majority of the popular vote for a long period, and because malapportionment had been largely ended, the political scientists Neal Blewett and Dean Jaensch said [...] "a Dunstan decade seems assured".|$|E

500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the people on both sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to <b>happen</b> <b>here</b> which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E

2500|$|Churchill {{suffered}} from heart problems for several years, and died on Christmas Eve 1900 {{of heart failure}} in her sleep while staying at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. She was found the following morning in her bed. Her body was transported to the mainland on 28 December, and was buried on 29 December 1900 at Finstock, Oxfordshire. Queen Victoria's personal physician, Sir James Reid, at first withheld the news of Churchill's death as he feared it would upset the frail and labile monarch. When finally told, the queen was shocked and barely ate. She wrote, [...] "The loss to me {{is not to be}} told... and that it should <b>happen</b> <b>here</b> is too sad". Queen Victoria died a month after Churchill's death.|$|E
2500|$|Erin Kimmerle is a {{forensic}} anthropologist and University of South Florida Associate Professor who {{is leading a}} USF team of anthropologists, biologists, and archaeologists exploring the Marianna campus.

Kimmerle commented, [...] "When {{you look at the}} state hospital, the state prisons, the other state institutions at the time, there are very meticulous plot maps you can reference. Or if you are a family member today, you can say, 'Where is my great-aunt buried?' and they can show you exactly where. So, why that didn't <b>happen</b> <b>here,</b> I don't know.
