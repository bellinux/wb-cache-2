5|$|After a long {{absence from}} politics, Marshall {{was called to}} one <b>final</b> <b>act</b> of public service. Upon the death of Martin D. Hardin who had been elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1823 but died before he could take office, Marshall pursued an {{abbreviated}} campaign for the vacant seat and defeated Jeptha Dudley {{by a margin of}} 3 votes. The primary issue of the day was the Old Court – New Court controversy, an attempt by the legislature to abolish the extant Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} new court in retaliation for overturning a replevin law passed in a previous legislative session. Marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election by virtue of his support for the Old Court, which was the prevailing sentiment in his district. His actions in the session, however, appear to have been unremarkable, and he did not seek reelection at the end of his term.|$|E

That {{was to be the}} <b>final</b> <b>act</b> of the match, as referee Massimo Busacca blew for full-time as soon as Xavi took the free kick.|$|E
50|$|Isao's <b>final</b> <b>acts</b> are to {{a certain}} extent nihilistic because he {{performs}} them after he has become aware of their falsehood and futility. In other words, it is a much more profound kind of suicide than the one he had been planning.|$|R
60|$|A wild exaltation, a {{fever of}} enthusiasm lent glamour to the scenes which were daily enacted on the Place de la Revolution, turning the <b>final</b> <b>acts</b> of the tragedies into glaring, lurid melodrama, almost unreal in its poignant {{appeal to the}} sensibilities.|$|R
