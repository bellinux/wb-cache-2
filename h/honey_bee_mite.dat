40|$|The {{reproduction}} of the <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> <b>mite,</b> Varroa destructor in sealed worker bee brood cells represents an important factor for the population development of this parasite in honey bee colonies. In this study, the relative infestation levels of worker brood cells, mite fertility (mites that lay at least one egg) and reproductive rate (number of viable adult daughters per mother mite) of Varroa mite in worker brood cells of Apis m. carnica and Apis m. syriaca were compared in fall 2003 and summer 2004 at two locations in Jordan. The relative infestation levels in sealed worker brood cells ranged from 23 – 32 % in fall and 19 – 28 % in summer. The average fertility of Varroa mite ranged between 90 - 98 % in colonies of A. m. carnica and between 88 - 96 % in A. m. syriaca with minor differences between colonies and locations. The number of total progeny of fertile mites in worker brood cells was 4. 0 in both bee races. The reproductive rate was high with 2. 7 and 2. 6 in both honey bee races. The post-capping period of the worker brood cells differs only slightly between both bee races and between locations (284. 4 h on average, n = 4, 000). Our data reveal surprisingly high mite fertility and reproductive rates in both honeybee races under Mediterranean conditions of Jordan. The possible physiological background of Varroa reproduction {{and the impact of}} mite fertility on the development of Varroa tolerance are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{diversity}} and consequences of viruses present in <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> is critical for maintaining pollinator health and managing the spread of disease. The viral landscape of <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera) has changed dramatically since {{the emergence of the}} parasitic mite Varroa destructor, which increased the spread of virulent variants of viruses such as deformed wing virus. Previous genomic studies have focused on colonies suffering from infections by Varroa and virulent viruses, which could mask other viral species present in <b>honey</b> <b>bees,</b> resulting in a distorted view of viral diversity. To capture the viral diversity within colonies that are exposed to mites but do not suffer the ultimate consequences of the infestation, we examined populations of <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> that have evolved naturally or have been selected for resistance to Varroa. This analysis revealed seven novel viruses isolated from <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> sampled globally, including the first identification of negative-sense RNA viruses in <b>honey</b> <b>bees.</b> Notably, two rhabdoviruses were present in three geographically diverse locations and were also present in Varroa <b>mites</b> parasitizing the <b>bees.</b> To characterize the antiviral response, we performed deep sequencing of small RNA populations in <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> and <b>mites.</b> This provided evidence of a Dicer-mediated immune response in <b>honey</b> <b>bees,</b> while the viral small RNA profile in Varroa mites was novel and distinct from the response observed in bees.

40|$|Abstract Background For years, the {{understanding}} of the pathogenetic mechanisms that underlie <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> viral diseases has been severely hindered {{because of the lack of}} a cell culture system for virus propagation. As a result, it is very imperative to develop new methods that would permit the in vitro pathogenesis study of <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> viruses. The identification of virus replication is an important step towards {{the understanding}} of the pathogenesis process of viruses in their respective hosts. In the present study, we developed a strand-specific RT-PCR-based method for analysis of Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) replication in <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> and in <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> parasitic <b>mites,</b> Varroa Destructor. Results The results shows that the method developed in our study allows reliable identification of the virus replication and solves the problem of falsely-primed cDNA amplifications that commonly exists in the current system. Using TaqMan real-time quantitative RT-PCR incorporated with biotinylated primers and magnetic beads purification step, we characterized the replication and tissue tropism of DWV infection in <b>honey</b> <b>bees.</b> We provide evidence for DWV replication in the tissues of wings, head, thorax, legs, hemolymph, and gut of <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> and also in Varroa mites. Conclusion The strategy reported in the present study forms a model system for studying bee virus replication, pathogenesis and immunity. This study should be a significant contribution to the goal of achieving a better understanding of virus pathogenesis in <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> and to the design of appropriate control measures for bee populations at risk to virus infections. </p...|$|R

40|$|The <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> ectoparasitic <b>mite,</b> Varroa destructor, has a world-wide {{distribution}} and inflicts more damage {{than all other}} known apicultural diseases.

The {{aim of this study}} was to see if this is the case for a unique population of mite-resistant (MR) European <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> on the island of Gotland, Sweden. This population has survived uncontrolled mite infestation for over a decade, developing specific mite-related resistance traits to do so.

Colony background information and winter loss data were obtained from beekeepers who had taken tracheal mite infested samples. A total of 2116 samples from <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colonies of 402 beekeepers were investigated. Infestations were found in 8 % of the beekeeping operations and in 10 % of the samples inspected. In the last years of the survey more than 20 % of apiaries were infested. This increase may be partly explained by tracheal mite infestations found in commercial queen-rearing apiaries. A field experiment with colonies infested at different levels showed that colonies in which 20 % or more of bees are infested with tracheal mites have an increased risk of dying during the winter under Finnish conditions. This infestation level was found among colonies in 92 % of the infested apiaries. Comparison of the tracheal mite prevalence in apiaries with their winter losses indicated that infestations were associated with colony mortality. The results of this survey point to the high pest potential of the tracheal mite in Finland, in contrast to findings on tracheal mites from elsewhere in Europe. Therefore, strategies to prevent further spread of the mite are highly recommended and methods for effective control should be sought. ...|$|R

During an acaricide treatment using Apistan (plastic strips coated with tau-fluvalinate), we analyzed the infection dynamics of deformed wing virus (DWV), sacbrood virus (SBV), and black queen cell virus (BQCV) in adult bees, mite-infested pupae, their associated Varroa mites, and uninfested pupae, comparing these to similar samples from untreated control colonies. Titers of DWV increased initially with the onset of the acaricide application and then slightly decreased progressively coinciding with the removal of the Varroa mite infestation. This initial increase in DWV titers suggests a physiological effect of tau-fluvalinate on the host's susceptibility to viral infection. DWV titers in adult bees and uninfested pupae remained higher in treated colonies than in untreated colonies. The titers of SBV and BQCV did not show any direct relationship with mite infestation and showed a variety of possible effects of the acaricide treatment.

40|$|The viral {{ecology of}} bee {{communities}} is complex, where viruses are readily shared among co-foraging bee species. Additionally, in <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera), many viruses are transmitted – and their impacts exacerbated – by the parasitic Varroa destructor mite. Thus far, the viruses {{found to be}} shared across bee species and transmitted by V. destructor mites are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Recently, a negative-sense RNA enveloped virus, Apis rhabdovirus- 1 (ARV- 1), was found in A. mellifera <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> in Africa, Europe, and islands in the Pacific. Here, we describe the identification – using a metagenomics approach – of ARV- 1 in two bee species (A. mellifera and Bombus impatiens) and in V. destructor mites from populations collected in the United States and Israel. We confirmed the presence of ARV- 1 in pools of A. mellifera, B. impatiens, and V. destructor from Israeli and U.

To estimate the prevalence of ARV- 1 in <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> populations, we screened 104 <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colonies across Israel, with 21 testing ARV- 1 -positive. Tagged-primer-mediated RT-PCR analysis detected the presence of the positive-sense ARV- 1 RNA in A. mellifera and V. destructor, indicating that ARV- 1 replicates in both hosts. This is the first report of the presence of ARV- 1 in B. impatiens and of the replication of a rhabdovirus in A. mellifera and V. destructor. Our data suggest that Varroa mites could act as an ARV- 1 vector; however, the presence of ARV- 1 in B. impatiens (which are not parasitized by Varroa) suggests that it may not require the mite for transmission and ARV- 1 may be shared among co-foraging bee species. Given that ARV- 1 is found in non-Apis bee species, and because “ARV” is used for the Adelaide River virus, we propose that this virus should be called bee rhabdovirus 1 and abbreviated BRV- 1. These results greatly expand our understanding of the diversity of viruses that can infect bee communities, though further analysis is required to determine how infection with this virus impacts these different hosts...|$|R

To elucidate these mechanisms, we analyzed the gene expression profile of uninfested and <b>mite</b> infested <b>bees,</b> under laboratory and field conditions, highlighting the effects of parasitization on the bee's transcriptome under a variety of conditions and scenarios.

Drifting drones facilitate the horizontal transmission of Varroa jacobsoni mites between colonies, especially in modern beekeeping in which managed colonies are kept similarly hived and close together. A great tendency of drones to drift among colonies was observed. A significant correlation was found in the rate of mites per drones and the number of drones in the colonies. It was concluded that the transmission of Varroa jacobsoni among colonies via drifting drones is a common mechanism for the transmission of mites. The relationship between mite load {{and the size of the}} <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> brood host was investigated. The data showed significant statistical differences between the infestation rate of the mite that is, number of female mites per infested pupae and the size of the worker brood nest of its host. With a high number of worker cells in the colony, the mite load is lowered. Feeding activities of V. jacobsoni causes a great impact on A. mellifera colony survival not only through physical damage caused by this mite but also through transmission of various entomopathogenic agents responsible for the outbreak of secondary diseases in the colony. I concluded that mites fed on adult bees during summer time. It appears that the frequency of mite feeding on adult bees at this time is low, suggesting that probably the mite feeds only for maintenance and survival rather than for reproduction...|$|R
40|$|The <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{familiar}} insects in the world, and plays an important role in the global economy providing essential pollination services to crops, fruit trees and vegetables. However, <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> health is severely threatened by the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, which feeds on the hemolymph of pupal and adult bees, resulting in loss of nutrients and circulatory fluids, decreased overall body weight and eventually the death of the bees. To investigate the molecular defense mechanisms of the <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> against varroa <b>mite</b> infestation, we employed DNA microarray analysis to compare gene expression of two contrasting <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colony phenotypes selected from the Saskatraz breeding program. One designated as G 4 is susceptible to the varroa mite, while the other designated as S 88 is highly tolerant to the varroa. Total RNAs were isolated from bees at two different stages, dark-eyed pupa and adult worker, infected or non-infected with varroa mites, and used for DNA microarray analysis. The results showed that distinct sets of genes were differentially regulated in the varroa-tolerant and varroa-susceptible <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> phenotypes, with and without varroa infestation. In both phenotypes, there were more differentially-expressed genes identified at the pupal stage than at the adult stage, indicating that at the pupal stage <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> are more responsive to the varroa infestation than adult bees. In the phenotype comparisons, substantially more differentially-expressed genes were found in the tolerant than susceptible line, indicating that the tolerant phenotype has an increased capacity to mobilize the expression of the genes in response to varroa mite infestation. Based on function, the differentially-expressed genes could be classified into groups that are involved in olfactory signal transduction, detoxification, metabolism and exoskeleton formation, implying several possible mechanisms for the host-parasite interaction and resistance. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm the data obtained from the DNA microarray hybridization. Eleven out of twelve genes selected based on the microarray data showed consistent expression patterns measured by both methods. Overall, comprehensive evaluation of the gene expression of <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> in response to the mite infestation by DNA microarray has revealed several possible molecular mechanisms for the host defense against the pest. Identification of highly differentially expressed genes between the two phenotypes provides potential biomarkers that can be used for breeding <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> resistant to the varroa mite...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} of damaged Varroadestructor Anderson and Trueman (Mesostigmata: Varroidae) {{found on the}} bottom board of hives of the <b>honey</b> <b>bee,</b> Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) {{has been used as}} an indicator of the degree of tolerance or resistance of <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colonies against <b>mites.</b> However, {{it is not clear that}} this measure is adequate. These injuries should be separated from regular dorsal dimples that have a developmental origin. To investigate damage to Varroa mites and regular dorsal dimples, 32 <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> (A. mellifera) colonies were selected from four Iranian provinces: Isfahan, Markazi, Qazvin, and Tehran. These colonies were part of the National <b>Honey</b> <b>bee</b> Breeding Program that resulted in province-specific races. In April, Varroa mites were collected from heavily infested colonies and used to infest the 32 experimental colonies. In August, 20 of these colonies were selected (five colonies from each province). Adult bees from these colonies were placed in cages and after introducing mites, damaged mites were collected from each cage every day. The average percentage of injured mites ranged from 0. 6 to 3. 0 % in four provinces. The results did not show any statistical differences between the colonies within provinces for injuries to mites, but there were some differences among province-specific lines. Two kinds of injuries to the mites were observed: injuries to legs and pedipalps, and injuries to other parts of the body. There were also some regular dorsal dimples on dorsal idiosoma of the mites that were placed in categories separate from <b>mites</b> damaged by <b>bees.</b> This type of classification helps identifying damage to mites and comparing them with developmental origin symptoms, and may provide criteria for selecting bees tolerant or resistant to this mite...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the existence of phenotypic and genotypic variation in the ability of <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colonies to restrain the population growth of the mite Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman, and to asses the relative effect of four characteristics that may confer tolerance to <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> toward the <b>mite.</b> Fifty-eight colonies infested with an equal number of mites were sampled monthly during six months to determine their levels of infestation on adult bees and in worker brood. At the end of this period, 16 colonies were selected to study the effect of grooming behavior, hygienic behavior, brood attractiveness, and host-induced non-reproduction. The infestation-levels in adult bees varied significantly between colonies (range: 6. 6 - 44. 7 %), but no differences were found in the brood infestation levels. The variation between colonies was partially genetic in origin. Grooming behavior explained most of the variation ($r^ 2 = 0. 38 $). Negative correlations were found between the mite population growth and both the total number of mites and the number of injured mites collected from the bottom-boards ($r = - 0. 65 $ and $r = - 0. 76 $, respectively). Differences were found for hygienic behavior but the effect of this mechanism was not clear. No differences were found among colonies for brood attractiveness, or for the effect of the brood on the mite's reproduction...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory bioassays were {{conducted}} to characterize the acute toxicity of 7 monoterpenoids to tracheal mites, Acarapis woodi (Rennie), and their <b>honey</b> <b>bee,</b> Apis mellifera L., hosts. Citral, thymol, carvacrol, α-terpineol, pulegone, d-limonene, and menthol were applied as fumigants to mite-infested <b>honey</b> <b>bees.</b> Thymol and menthol were the most toxic compounds to <b>honey</b> <b>bees,</b> and α-terpineol was the least toxic. Menthol, citral, thymol, and carvacrol were more toxic to tracheal <b>mites</b> than to <b>honey</b> <b>bees.</b> Pulegone, d-limonene, and α-terpineol were more toxic to <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> than to tracheal mites. Menthol was 18. 9 times more toxic to tracheal <b>mites</b> than to <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> at the LC 50 concentrations; however, as the concentration increased, bee mortality increased more rapidly than mite mortality, and menthol was only 5. 7 times more toxic at the LC 90 concentrations.

40|$|Populations of <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> in North America {{have been}} {{experiencing}} high annual colony mortality for 15 - 20 years. Many apicultural {{researchers believe that}} introduced parasites called Varroa mites (V. destructor) {{are the most important}} factor in colony deaths. One important resistance mechanism that limits mite population growth in colonies is the ability of some lines of <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> to groom <b>mites</b> from their bodies. To search for genes influencing this trait, we used an Illumina Bead Station genotyping array to determine the genotypes of several hundred worker bees at over a thousand single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a family that was apparently segregating for alleles influencing this behavior. Linkage analyses provided a genetic map with 1, 313 markers anchored to genome sequence. Genotypes were analyzed for association with grooming behavior, measured as the time that individual bees took to initiate grooming after mites were placed on their thoraces. Quantitative-trait-locus interval mapping identified a single chromosomal region that was significant at the chromosome-wide level (p< 0. 05) on chromosome 5 with a LOD score of 2. 72. The 95 % confidence interval for quantitative trait locus location contained only 27 genes (<b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> official gene annotation set 2) including Atlastin, Ataxin and Neurexin- 1 (AmNrx 1), which have potential neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects. Atlastin and Ataxin homologs are associated with neurological diseases in humans. AmNrx 1 codes for a presynaptic protein with many alternatively spliced isoforms. Neurexin- 1 influences the growth, maintenance and maturation of synapses in the brain, as well as the type of receptors most prominent within synapses. Neurexin- 1 has also been associated with autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia in humans, and self-grooming behavior in mice...|$|R
