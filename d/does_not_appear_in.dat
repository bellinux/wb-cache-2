5|$|According to Cassius Dio, {{the conspirators}} {{approached}} Nerva {{as a potential}} successor prior to the assassination, suggesting {{that he was at}} least aware of the plot. He <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> Suetonius' version of the events, but this may be understandable, since his works were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian. To suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder would have been less than sensitive.|$|E

5|$|Banai <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the Malhari Mahatmya {{originating}} from the Brahmin (high-priest caste) tradition, which glorifies Khandoba as Shiva and de-emphasizes his earthly connections. In contrast, Banai occupies the central {{position in the}} Dhangar folk narrative and Mhalsa's marriage to Khandoba is reduced to a passing mention; Marathas and other settled castes give more importance to Mhalsa.|$|E
5|$|Fleance {{appears in}} Shakespeare's Macbeth. However, only his {{childhood}} is portrayed; {{the rest of}} his story, as it is described in Holinshed's Chronicles, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> Shakespeare's play. Scholars suggest that Shakespeare does not elaborate on Fleance's life after his escape from Scotland to avoid unnecessary distraction from the story of Macbeth himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} the first to mention the {{character}} of Tina, Elaine's actress roommate, although she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> this episode. It is also the first episode to feature Kramer making a sliding entrance into Jerry's apartment, which became a trademark in all the later episodes.

5|$|Film {{historian}} Film News Anandan noticed {{publicity stills}} of Nadodi Mannan on Veerappan's office desk when {{he happened to}} visit the office of Em.Gee.Yar Pictures. He then offered to distribute them to the press. Veerappan agreed knowing that Anandan was then {{a member of the}} South Indian Film Journalists Association. After a few days, stills of the film were published in many magazines. Ramachandran was impressed with Anandan's work and, at Veerappan's suggestion, hired him as the film's public relations officer (PRO). This was Anandan's debut film as a PRO; however, his name <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the opening credits.|$|E

In the same year, he was cast in the role of an Aboriginal caretaker for a film he said was called Sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|In late 1261 Breton {{is noted}} as owing £120 {{in the royal}} records. A {{notation}} next to the debt implies {{that he was a}} canon of Hereford Cathedral at this point, but the Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300 does not identify him as such. Breton <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the records from this point until after the Battle of Evesham in 1265, when he is noted as holding a grant of royal safeguarding.|$|E

5|$|The Ramayana further adds: Kabandha {{spent his}} days near the hermitage of the sage Matanga in the Krauncha forest. There, he spent his time scaring sages. Once, Kabandha {{attacked}} the sage Stulashira, who cursed him to remain in his hideous form for eternity. Upon Kabandha's pleading, the sage reduced his curse and said that Kabandha would be freed of his form, once Rama and Lakshmana sever his arms. So Kabandha waited in that forest for Rama's arrival. Growse suspected the tale to be a later interpolation arguing that it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> all versions/translations of the original Ramayana.|$|E
5|$|The oral {{legends and}} texts {{initiate}} {{a process of}} Sanskritization of the folk deity Khandoba by elevating him to the classical Hindu god Shiva; his two principal wives Mhalsa and Banai are equated to Parvati and Ganga. Banai <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the Sanskrit Malhari Mahatmya, the main scripture related to Khandoba, however it mentions Ganga arriving from heaven. Banai (Ganga) has a quarrel with Mhalsa (Parvati), ultimately ending with the message that both are the same. Some Dhangars consider Banai also to {{be a form of}} Parvati.|$|E
5|$|The role as {{the first}} Felix Leiter was given to Jack Lord. This is Bond and Leiter's first time meeting each other on film and Leiter <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the novel. Leiter returns for many of Bond's future adventures and in the 2006 reboot of the film series, Casino Royale, Leiter and Bond are seen meeting one another again for the first time. This was Lord's only {{appearance}} as Leiter, as he asked for more money and a better billing to return as Leiter in Goldfinger and was subsequently replaced.|$|E

Accordingly, Emilia Clarke, Iain Glen, Harry Lloyd, Richard Madden and Kit Harington all have their names omitted from the opening titles.
