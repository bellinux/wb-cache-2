60|$|These verses are {{preceded by}} a brief account of the lady, in Latin prose, in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted {{language}} of affection. But, without this <b>introductory</b> <b>communication</b> I should myself have had no doubt, after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation, that this man, notwithstanding his extravagant expressions, was a sincere mourner; and that his heart, during {{the very act of}} composition, was moved. These fantastic images, though they stain the writing, stained not her soul,--they did not even touch it; but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf, along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it. This simple-hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse;--that it is not the Muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the Muse. And having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste, it is probable that, in the excess of his modesty, the blankness of his inexperience, and the intensity of his affection, he thought that the further he wandered from Nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort, who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments. The quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion.|$|E

The NCA serves the scholars, teachers, and practitioners who are its members by enabling and supporting their professional interests in research and teaching. Dedicated to fostering and promoting free and ethical communication, the NCA promotes the widespread appreciation {{of the importance of}} communication in public and private life, the application of competent communication {{to improve the quality of}} human life and relationships, and the use of knowledge about communication to solve human problems. The National Communication Association is a nonprofit organization with the goal of promoting the study, criticism, research, teaching, in addition to the application of the artistic, humanistic and scientific principles of communication, Located in Washington, D.C., the organization selects the finest teachers and scholars whose vision and dedication shaped the mission, as well as the spirit of the organization, as leaders of the NCA. Beebe was president of the National Communication Association for the year 2013. During Beebe's presidency in 2013, he focused on strengthening the basic course - calling the <b>introductory</b> <b>communication</b> course [...] "the front porch" [...] of the discipline. In addition to this, he also spent time promoting the NCA to different countries, along with sharing the organizations current philosophy and goals. He added additional resources to the NCA website about internationalism. Russia became a strategic location for promoting the values of the NCA, and during multiple trips there, Beebe became a key component of establishing communication studies programs. His efforts in stressing the importance of education of communication eventually led to the creation of the Russian Communication Association. Currently as a chair member, he is responsible for appointing new leaders and leadership assignments.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the interacting affects of sex-role orientation,, biological sex, and target recipient gender upon levels of self-disclosure. Two measuring instruments were employed in this study: (1) the Bern Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI) which measured subjects' sex-role orientations, and (2) the Jourard Self-Disclosure Questionnaire (JSDQ) which measured subjects' self-disclosure levels to male and female targets. The sample consisted of 200 male and female undergraduate students enrolled in <b>introductory</b> speech <b>communication</b> courses. Six research hypotheses were posited in a linear fashion predicting that sex-role orientations would determine levels of self-disclosure.

40|$|Purpose of the Study. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the basic language usage skills which are needed by students enrolled in the Basic Business Communications course at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and to develop and validate an instrument to measure these skills. ^ Procedures. Selected literature was surveyed to identify language usage skills which might be covered in an <b>introductory</b> business <b>communication</b> course. Data collected from this survey of literature were used to develop a comprehensive composite list of language usage skills. The content validity of the composite list was established by a nine-member jury of experts in the field of business communication. ^ Jury members were asked to indicate those items on the composite list which should be included or omitted from study in an <b>introductory</b> business <b>communication</b> course and which students in such a course should master. The jury responses were used in determining the items to be included in the language skills test. Test items were developed for those items receiving the highest percentage of positive responses from jury members. The test questions were then submitted to the jury of experts for content validation and to determine item clarity and item significance. ^ After the development and validation of the initial test form, the language skills test was taken through three stages of revision to arrive at a final testing instrument. The test was administered to students enrolled in sections of Basic Business Communications at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln during the first and second summer sessions of 1980 and the fall semester of the 1980 - 1981 school year. ^ After each administration of the test, the results were subjected to item analysis statistics to determine how test items functioned with regard to (1) the discrimination power for each item, (2) the difficulty level of each item, and (3) the internal consistency of the testing instrument as measured by coefficient alpha. The item analysis provided statistical data for item retention or deletion. ^ In order to determine the degree of concurrent validity existing between the developed language skills test and an established standardized language skills test, 30 randomly selected students from the final testing group were also given the Cooperative English Test. Student scores from both the developed language skills test and the standardized Cooperative English Test were subjected to the Pearson Product Moment Correlation analysis which computed the degree of correlation between the two tests. ^ Findings and Conclusions. The language skills which jury members considered to be most important in the development of effectively written business communications included various aspects of grammar, sentence construction, word choice, emphasis, tone, paragraphing, capitalization, punctuation, and the expression of numbers. ^ The internal consistency of the final testing instrument as shown by a coefficient alpha of 0. 8359 indicated that the test was reliable and was a suitable instrument for identifying language usage strengths and weaknesses. In addition, a Pearson Product Moment Correlation of 0. 7595 which existed between the developed language skills test and the standardized Cooperative English Test was a further indication that the language skills test was a reliable testing instrument. ^ Based on the findings of this study, the following conclusions were reached: (1) The content of the testing instrument was valid. (2) The instrument was internally consistent and was a reliable testing instrument. (3) A mean score of 52. 0602 from a total of 85 items on the final test form indicated that college students enrolled in the Basic Business Communications course at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln were weak in the area of language usage skills. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Students in <b>introductory</b> <b>communication</b> theory classes {{can benefit}} from a well-planned {{laboratory}} component. Some schools choose not to include a laboratory section at all, while others rely completely on software packages to demonstrate communication concepts. One problem is the difficulty of furnishing student workbenches with enough equipment to handle {{a wide variety of}} experiments ranging from analog baseband to pass-band digital communications. Although such labs are available at many universities, high cost prohibits their use in many smaller departments. This paper describes several common options for communications labs including off-the-shelf instrumentation labs, specialized instructional lab modules, and software-only solutions. Finally, we describe an alternative being studied at the University of Wyoming (UW). It is based on the software radio concept and implemented using inexpensive DSP Starter Kits (DSKs) from Texas Instruments. Students program modulation algorithms on a &quot;transmitter &quot; DSK, and detection algorithms on a &quot;receiver &quot; DSK. Real-world signals are investigated using standard oscilloscopes and spectrum analyzers. Being software based, the system can be adapted to nearly any communication experiment, while also providing an important hardware feel that is missing from purely software-based approaches...|$|E

Newspapers moved online and onto social media, music moved to streaming services, and television moved to streaming video on demand. As television moved online, people have begun to binge?watch television shows. Binge-watching {{is the process of}} watching two or more episodes of a television show in a single sitting. This study explores how television?viewing habits have changed due to the digital mediamorphosis of television. Surveys and focus groups gathered data to find what motivates people to binge?watch television and how these motivations differ from watching television weekly. The research was based in uses and gratifications theory and cultivation theory. 127 undergraduates enrolled in <b>introductory</b> <b>communication</b> courses at Wichita State University took place in the study. The survey found statistically significant differences between binge?watchers and traditional watchers, and the focus groups explored if and how the two watching experiences differed. The study found that binge?watchers reported higher levels of entertainment, relationships with character, escapism, and basis for social interaction than traditional watchers. Because binge?watching involves watching a television show quickly, binge?watchers consume stories more quickly and find higher levels of entertainment, relationships with characters, escapism,and basis for social interaction through the narrative of the television show.

40|$|Rationale and objectives: Multiculturalism {{presents}} linguistic {{obstacles to}} health care provision. We explored the early introduction of "interpreter" role-play exercises in teaching medical undergraduates communication skills. The interpreter role creates a natural barrier in communication providing an active prompt for recognizing learning needs in this area. Methods: Bilingual Cantonese first-year medical students (n = 160) were randomly allocated to either "Observer" or "Interpreter" role plays at a small-group <b>introductory</b> <b>communication</b> skills workshop using a quasi experimental design, counterbalanced across tutors. Students assessed their own skill competence before and, together with {{their perceptions of the}} different role plays' effectiveness, again after the workshop, using an anonymous 16 item Likert-type scale, analysed using ANOVA and MANOVA. Results: Students' assessments of their skills improved significantly following the workshop (F = 73. 19 [1, 156], P = 0. 0009). Students in the observer group reported greater changes in their scores following the workshop than did students in the interpreter group (F = 4. 84 [1, 156], P = 0. 029), largely due to improvement in perceived skill (F = 4. 38 [1, 156], P = 0. 038) rather than perceived programme effectiveness (F = 3. 13 [1, 156], P > 0. 05). Subsequent MANOVA indicated no main effect of observer/interpreter conditions, indicating these differences could be attributed to chance alone (F = 1. 41 [16 141], P > 0. 05). Conclusion: The workshop positively influenced students' perceived communication skills, but the "Interpreter" role was less effective than the "Observer" role in achieving this. Future studies should examine whether interpreter role plays introduced later in the medical programme are beneficial. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{transnational}} diasporas in {{a technological}} {{world that is}} postmodern and posthuman mean both exciting diverse communities and challenging problems.

Responding to the current transnational clashes in flow (information dissemination) and contra flow (surveillance and control of information flow) of our information age, this dissertation builds up a transnational rhetoric and communication model {{that can be used to}} examine the curriculum design, teaching materials, and pedagogy in communication and writing studies, especially in technical communication. In addition, this study investigates the present state of curriculum design, teaching materials, and pedagogies in a southeastern higher education institution.
