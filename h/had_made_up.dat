5|$|The hemmema {{replaced}} the galleys that <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> {{the core of}} the Swedish archipelago fleets until the mid-18th century. Compared to galleys, the hemmema had a deeper draft and was slower under oars, but offered superior accommodation for the crew, carried more stores, was more seaworthy and had roughly ten times as many heavy guns. It could be propelled by either sails or oars but was still smaller and more maneuverable than most sailing warships, which made it suitable for operations in confined waters.|$|E
5|$|After Gaza was {{occupied}} on 7 November, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade (XXI Corps) rode through {{the ruins of}} Gaza to reach Beit Hanun at 13:00; and the 157th Brigade (52nd Division) began the infantry pursuit along the Mediterranean shore, to reach Sheikh Hasan by 12:15. In {{the centre of the}} line the Anzac Mounted Division found a gap on the eastern side of Sheria to begin their pursuit at daylight on 7 November. After being held up at Sheria, the Australian Mounted Division and the 60th (London) Division advanced to capture Huj on 8 November. By that evening, all the Ottoman positions which <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> the Gaza-to-Beersheba line had been captured, and the erstwhile defenders were in full retreat.|$|E
5|$|Greg Glienna did {{not come}} up with the surname Focker; Greg's {{character}} in the original film did not have a last name. The name was written into the script after Jim Carrey {{came up with the idea}} for the Focker surname during a creative session held before he abandoned the project. Once Meet the Parents was submitted for rating evaluation, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) questioned the surname Focker as possibly an expletive and, due to the repetitiveness of the surname throughout the film, the film was in danger of being rated R according to the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. The filmmakers were asked if they <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> the name or if they can prove that such a name exists. The studio submitted to the MPAA a list of real people with the surname Focker which ensured that the film retained a PG-13 rating.|$|E

5|$|In late 2004, a man {{allegedly}} gave Murray's {{father a}} rusty, stained knife {{that belonged to}} the man's brother, who had a criminal past and lived {{less than a mile from}} where the car was discovered. His brother and his brother's girlfriend were said to have acted strangely after the disappearance, and the man's brother claimed he believed the knife had been used to kill Murray. Several days after the knife was given to Fred Murray, the man's brother allegedly scrapped his Volvo. Family members of the man who turned in the knife claimed he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> the story in order to obtain reward money in the investigation, and that he had a history of drug use.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} {{spilled over}} into the next Australian season when an English team formed by Alfred Shaw, James Lillywhite and Arthur Shrewsbury toured. A disagreement between Alexander and Lillywhite led {{to members of the}} Fourth Australians refusing to play against the tourists in certain matches and then being banned by the colonial authorities from playing in others. Having agreed contracts for matches with the colonial authorities, Lillywhite offered Alexander 30% of the gate receipts from the first two Tests, but Murdoch {{and the rest of the}} team insisted on 50%. One outcome was that Australia had to make eleven changes to their team for the second Test after terms could not be agreed with the Fourth Australians. The Fourth Australians <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> the team in the first Test but refused to play in the second Test in which nine debutants were necessary alongside Tom Horan and Sammy Jones.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} general dinosaur faunas {{in the late}} Cretaceous. In the {{northern}} continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were tyrannosaurids and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and pachycephalosaurians. In the southern continents that <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> the now-splitting Gondwana, abelisaurids were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores. Finally, in Europe, dromaeosaurids, rhabdodontid iguanodontians, nodosaurid ankylosaurians, and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent. Flowering plants were greatly radiating, with the first grasses appearing {{by the end of}} the Cretaceous. Grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across North America and Asia. Theropods were also radiating as herbivores or omnivores, with therizinosaurians and ornithomimosaurians becoming common.|$|E

Public debt holders rapidly sold their tesobonos, depleting the Central Bank's reserves, while portfolio investments, which <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> 90% of total investment flows, left the country as fast as they had come in.|$|E

25|$|The {{expulsion}} of the industrious Jews, Moors, and Moriscos {{did nothing to}} advance the Spanish economy. The small scattered groups of Moriscos lived largely by subsistence farming in marginal mountain areas or by unskilled laboring {{in a country that}} had very many underemployed hands. A council set up to investigate the matter in Castile found little effect, but in parts of Aragon and especially Valencia, where half the Moriscos had lived, and <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> a substantial minority of the population, the impact was certainly noticeable for the noblemen who had lost rents.|$|E
25|$|According to Carretta, Vassa's baptismal {{record and}} a naval muster roll {{document}} him as from South Carolina. Carretta interpreted these anomalies as possible evidence that Equiano <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> the account of his African origins, and adopted material from others. But, Paul Lovejoy, Alexander X. Byrd, and Douglas Chambers note how many general and specific details Carretta can document from sources that related to the slave trade in the 1750s as described by Equiano, including the voyages from Africa to Virginia, sale to Captain Michael Henry Pascal in 1754, and others. They conclude he was more likely telling what he understood as fact than creating a fictional account; his work is shaped as an autobiography.|$|E
