5|$|The {{illustrations}} {{provide insight}} <b>into</b> <b>life</b> and festivities at the Heian Palace; which sometimes consisted of {{something as simple}} as games on the lake although those might have been perceived differently at the time of manufacture. Like other picture scrolls on court life such as the Genji Monogatari Emaki or the Pillow Book Emaki (Makura no Sōshi Emaki) they provide valuable information on the architectural shinden-zukuri style (particularly on interiors) which is characterized by a mixture of Tang and traditional Japanese influences.|$|E
30|$|The {{socialization}} <b>into</b> working <b>life</b> in {{an industrial}} sector normally begins with industrial specific vocational education and training (VET) (Schaap et al. 2012). During VET, young individuals socialize <b>into</b> professional <b>life</b> by receiving education and training to become working members of a professional community. VET {{can be understood as}} a socialization process <b>into</b> working <b>life</b> in general, and into work in a specific industrial sector in particular. During construction industry VET, young individuals socialize <b>into</b> working <b>life</b> in the construction industry, and an essential aspect of this socialization is the transmission of implicit knowledge and understandings (Schaap et al. 2012).|$|R

5|$|After the shipwreck, Grill {{remained}} in Canton as resident supercargo for seven years. As such {{he was the}} company's representative in Canton, contacting Chinese merchants as well as buying goods and cargo for the ships. He was supercargo {{for the arrival of}} three more ships of the SIOC: the Stockholms Slott (outward journey) in 1762, the Stockholms Slott (resident supercargo in Canton) in 1765 and the Cron Prins Gustaf (journey home) 1768. One of his tasks in Canton was {{to make sure that the}} Swedish factory at the Thirteen Factories was in good order and maintained. The Swedes rented factories or houses from the mandarins at other locations as well, but the one on 13:e Faktorigatan (the 13th Factory street) operated as their main building. Grills records of the Swedish factory are detailed and provide good insight <b>into</b> <b>life</b> in Canton at that time.|$|E
5|$|Following hospitalization, Shinji {{moves in}} with Misato and settles <b>into</b> <b>life</b> in Tokyo-3. In his second battle, Shinji destroys an Angel but runs away afterwards, distraught. Misato confronts Shinji and {{he decides to}} remain a pilot. The Nerv crew and Shinji must then battle and defeat the {{remaining}} 14 Angels {{in order to prevent}} the Third Impact, a global cataclysm that would destroy the world. Evangelion Unit-00 is repaired shortly afterwards. Shinji tries to befriend its pilot, the mysterious, socially isolated teenage girl Rei Ayanami. With Rei's help, Shinji defeats another Angel. They are then joined by the pilot of Evangelion Unit-02, the multitalented, but insufferable teenager Asuka Langley Soryu, who is German-Japanese and resides in America. Together, the three of them manage to defeat several Angels.|$|E
5|$|In January 1933, the Nazi Party came {{to power}} in Germany. In May, Born became one of six Jewish professors at Göttingen who were {{suspended}} with pay; Franck had already resigned. In twelve years they had built Göttingen into one of the world's foremost centres for physics. Born began looking for a new job, writing to Maria Göppert-Mayer at Johns Hopkins University and Rudi Ladenburg at Princeton University. Offers soon started to pour in, and he accepted one from St John's College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he wrote a popular science book, The Restless Universe, and a textbook, Atomic Physics, that soon became a standard text, going through seven editions. His family soon settled <b>into</b> <b>life</b> in England, with his daughters Irene and Gritli becoming engaged to Welshman Brinley (Bryn) Newton-John (Olivia Newton-John's parents; Born is Olivia's grandfather and Irene is her mother) and Englishman Maurice Pryce respectively.|$|E

5|$|The team {{is called}} {{to the home of}} a man whose heart was removed through a {{makeshift}} operation. They learn that not only did someone call for emergency help shortly after the heart's removal, but the man was found alive by the emergency response team well after his heart was removed, though he eventually died by the time Fringe arrived. Walter (John Noble) and Peter recognize scars on the blood vessels leading to the heart, identifying the victim as one that received a heart transplant. During the autopsy at the lab, Walter concludes that a serum was used to prolong the victim's life well after the heart's removal, a chemical based on his own past research <b>into</b> <b>life</b> restoration.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} the player {{controlling}} the main character, Amaterasu, in a woodcut, watercolor style, cel-shaded environment, {{which looks like}} an animated Japanese ink-illustration (known as ink wash painting, sumi-e) with other styles of art. The gameplay style {{is a mix of}} action, platform, and puzzle gaming genres, and has been noted by many reviewers to have numerous similarities in overall gameplay style to The Legend of Zelda series, an inspiration that director Hideki Kamiya, a self-proclaimed Zelda-fan, has admitted has influenced his general game design. The main story is primarily linear, directed through by Amaterasu's guide Issun, though numerous side quests and optional activities allow for players to explore the game world and take the story at their own pace. By completing quests, side quests and small additional activities (such as making trees bloom <b>into</b> <b>life</b> or feeding wild animals), Amaterasu earns Praise, which can then be spent to increase various statistics of the character, such as the amount of health and number of ink wells for Celestial Brush techniques.|$|E
5|$|While using Dante's terza rima style, {{the poem}} {{continues}} by describing the Battle of Britain. The image of warfare merges with {{the depiction of}} Pentecost, and the Holy Spirit is juxtaposed with the air-raids on London. In the second section, a ghost, representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds, begins talking to the narrator of the poem. The ghost discusses change, art in general, and how humankind is flawed. The only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity, according to the ghost, is to experience purgation through fire. The fire is described {{in a manner similar}} to Julian of Norwich's writing about God's love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of Nessus, a shirt that burns its wearer. Little Gidding continues by describing the eternalness of the present and how history exists in a pattern. The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die <b>into</b> <b>life</b> and be reborn, and that salvation should be the goal of humankind.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{abstract}} artists in Russia became Constructivists believing that art {{was no longer}} something remote, but life itself. The artist must become a technician, learning to use the tools and materials of modern production. Art <b>into</b> <b>life!</b> was Vladimir Tatlin's slogan, and {{that of all the}} future Constructivists. Varvara Stepanova and Alexandre Exter and others abandoned easel painting and diverted their energies to theatre design and graphic works.|$|E

But he also left a legacy {{to those of us}} that remain. At the time of his death, The Lutheran Hour that he founded had become the largest regular broadcast – secular or religious – in the history of radio. His books and transcriptions of those sermons are available online today.|$|E
25|$|After the August 1944 Coup removed Antonescu and aligned Romania {{with the}} Allies, Lecca {{was among the}} {{high-ranking}} Romanian politicians arrested and transported to the Soviet Union. Upon his 1946 return, Lecca was Antonescu's co-defendant in a People's Tribunal case, and was condemned to death. His sentence was commuted <b>into</b> <b>life</b> imprisonment and later reduced by the communist regime. After his release, Lecca wrote memoirs which make various controversial claims, and which minimize his and Antonescu's participation in Holocaust-related crimes.|$|E

25|$|The 1996–97 season started just {{as badly}} as the last, with three {{straight}} losses. However, the introduction of young forward Andrew Fotiadis saw Luton burst <b>into</b> <b>life,</b> as they shot up {{the table with a}} run of eight wins and two draws in eleven games. Tony Thorpe, too, proved to be a revelation, scoring 28 goals to become the division's top scorer. Luton were nearly promoted, but finished in third place on goal difference and then lost to Crewe Alexandra in the play-offs.|$|E
25|$|In 1346, {{when the}} Prince (aged 16) {{was about to}} leave with his father for his first {{campaign}} in France, which culminated in the battle of Crecy, a Council was set up to manage on his behalf his various manors and lordships throughout the country. The transactions of this Council were recorded and have been printed and published by the Public Record Office. Many decisions affecting Risborough were made by this Council rather than by the Prince himself. They give us some insight <b>into</b> <b>life</b> at Risborough in the 14th century.|$|E
