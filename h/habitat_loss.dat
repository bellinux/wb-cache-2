5|$|Although not {{immediately}} threatened, crested and marbled newts suffer from population declines, caused mainly by <b>habitat</b> <b>loss</b> and fragmentation.

40|$|There is an {{important}} pioneer vegetation formation along the Xingu River {{in the area where}} the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam is being constructed that is highly adapted to a seasonally fluctuating water levels. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the habitat and flora of the pioneer formations in the Belo Monte area. The area was divided in three sections for study purposes (Reservoir, Low Flow, and Control) that were expected to experience different degrees of impact from the dam project. The calculations of <b>habitat</b> <b>losses</b> were based on satellite imagery classifications, and a total of 111 plots were established in the three areas for vegetation sampling. <b>Habitat</b> <b>losses</b> of the pioneer formations will total 89. 7 % when the project is fully functional. Forty-five of the 72 recorded species are restricted to single areas. Species richness and diversity were significantly lower in the control area. The completion of the Belo Monte reservoir will result in habitat reductions and will consequently reduce the richness and diversity of pioneer formations. Studies suggest monitoring the populations located in the reduced flow area to determine possible impacts resulting from changes in the regional hydrological cycle caused by the Xingu River dam...|$|R
5|$|Although {{the wild}} {{population}} is in decline because of predation by feral animals and <b>habitat</b> <b>loss</b> caused by human agricultural development, {{the numbers of}} iguanas have been bolstered {{as a result of}} captive-breeding and other conservation programs. Cyclura nubila has been used to study evolution and animal communication, and its captive-breeding program has been a model for other endangered lizards in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 35% of {{echinoderm}} genera became extinct at the K–Pg boundary, although taxa that {{thrived in}} low-latitude, shallow-water environments {{during the late}} Cretaceous had the highest extinction rate. Mid-latitude, deep-water echinoderms were much less affected at the K–Pg boundary. The pattern of extinction points to <b>habitat</b> <b>loss,</b> specifically the drowning of carbonate platforms, the shallow-water reefs in existence at that time, by the extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Around 59 {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} are {{threatened}} with extinction today, about 19% of all species. Most of these are tropical and live on islands. All of the species are threatened by introduced predators, <b>habitat</b> <b>loss,</b> hunting, {{or a combination of}} these factors. In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by <b>habitat</b> <b>loss</b> and introduced feral cats. In some areas, a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown; the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953, and {{may or may not be}} extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown.|$|E
30|$|We {{defined the}} {{potential}} habitat for huemul, where forest edges and ecotone zones (e.g., mainly alpine environments) {{were the most}} important environmental variables, as well as some forest types (e.g., Nothofagus pumilio). <b>Habitat</b> <b>losses</b> were found in the extreme potential distribution areas (northern and southern areas), probably related to the increasing ranch activities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project is to protect, enhance, and {{mitigate}} fish and wildlife resources impacted by Columbia River Basin hydroelectric development. The effort {{is one of several}} wildlife mitigation projects in the region developed to compensate for terrestrial <b>habitat</b> <b>losses</b> resulting from the construction of McNary and John Day Hydroelectric facilities located on the mainstem Columbia River. While this project is driven primarily by the purpose and need to mitigate for wildlife <b>habitat</b> <b>losses,</b> it is also recognized that management strategies will also benefit many other non-target fish and wildlife species and associated natural resources. The Northwest Power Act directs the NPPC to develop a program to ''protect, mitigate, and enhance'' fish and wildlife of the Columbia River and its tributaries. The overarching goals include: A Columbia River ecosystem that sustains an abundant, productive, and diverse community of fish and wildlife; Mitigation across the basin for the adverse effects to fish and wildlife caused by the development and operation of the hydrosystem; Sufficient populations of fish and wildlife for abundant opportunities for tribal trust and treaty right harvest and for non-tribal harvest; and Recovery of the fish and wildlife affected by the development and operation of the hydrosystem that are listed under the Endangered Species Act...|$|R

5|$|Cockatoos {{prefer to}} eat seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers and insects. They often feed in large flocks, {{particularly}} when ground-feeding. Cockatoos are monogamous and nest in tree hollows.

5|$|Curator of Birds Gary R. Graves of the Smithsonian Institution spent 18 years {{scouring}} {{the island for}} evidence of the taxon without success. He is doubtful of its survival as it is diurnal and Jamaica is a popular destination for birdwatchers. The exact cause of the likely extinction is unknown, but predation by introduced mammals, especially the black rat but possibly also the Indian mongoose, {{is thought to be}} a factor. Graves points out that {{there is little evidence that}} <b>habitat</b> <b>loss</b> has played a role. It is noted that this swallow is not affected by being near human disturbance. Graves also added that the swallows adapted to nesting in man-made structures. In general, this swallow is not affected by being near human disturbance.
