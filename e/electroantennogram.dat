50|$|Olfactory receptors on the {{antennae}} bind to free-floating molecules, such {{as water}} vapour, and odours including pheromones. The neurons that possess these receptors signal this binding by sending action potentials down their axons to the antennal lobe in the brain. From there, neurons in the antennal lobes connect to mushroom bodies that identify the odour. The sum of the electrical potentials of the antennae to a given odour can be measured using an <b>electroantennogram.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{teaching}} at the University of Houston, Hardin, along with fellow scientists Balaji Krishnan and Stuart Dryer, investigated circadian rhythms of olfaction in Drosophila. Previous experiments had shown that Drosophila antennae demonstrate circadian rhythms. However, the mechanism for circadian rhythms in the antennae was unknown. To determine the mechanism of rhythms in antennae, Hardin and his team kept wild-type and mutant flies, per01 and tim01, in 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycles and measured olfaction in the antennae with an <b>electroantennogram</b> (EAG), that measures the average output of an insect antenna to its brain for a given odor, over a 24-hour period. Only the wild-type flies demonstrated rhythmicity in the electrical activity, which indicated that circadian rhythms {{were present in the}} olfactory response. In contrast, the mutants showed no cyclic activity. Therefore, Hardin’s team discovered that circadian rhythms control the olfactory response in Drosophila antennae and his results were eventually published in Nature.|$|E

The effect of ZnSO 4 on con-tact chemosensitive sensilla was tested behaviorally using the proboscis extension response and that on olfactory sensilla using <b>electroantennogram</b> recordings. We showed that antennal ZnSO 4 -treat-ment significantly reduced the sugar-elicited proboscis extension response but did not reduce olfac-tory evoked <b>electroantennogram</b> responses.

40|$|Abstract In the cockroach, {{olfactory}} sensitivity {{as measured}} by the amplitude of the <b>electroantennogram</b> (EAG) is regulated by the circadian system. We wished to determine how this rhythm in antennal response was reflected in the activity of individual olfactory receptor neurons. The amplitude of the EAG and the activity of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in single olfactory sen-silla were recorded simultaneously for 3 to 5 days in constant darkness from an antenna of the cockroach Leucophaea maderae. Both EAG amplitude and the spike frequency of the ORNs exhibited circadian rhythms with peak ampli-tude/activity occurring in the subjective day. The phases of the rhythms were dependent on the phase of the prior light cycle and thus were entrainable by light. Ablation of the optic lobes abolished the rhythm in EAG amplitude as has been previously reported. In contrast, the rhythm in ORN response persisted following surgery. These results indicated that a circadian clock outside the optic lobes can regulate the responses of olfactory receptor neurons and further that this modulation of the ORN response is not dependent on the circadian rhythm in EAG amplitude.

40|$|Abstract Background Chemical {{insecticides}} against mosquitoes are a {{major component}} of malaria control worldwide. Fungal entomopathogens formulated as biopesticides and applied as insecticide residual sprays could augment current control strategies and mitigate the evolution of resistance to chemical-based insecticides. Methods Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were exposed to Beauveria bassiana or Metarhizium acridum fungal spores and sub-lethal effects of exposure to fungal infection were studied, especially the potential for reductions in feeding and host location behaviours related to olfaction. Electrophysiological techniques, such as <b>electroantennogram,</b> electropalpogram and single sensillum recording techniques were then employed to investigate how fungal exposure affected the olfactory responses in mosquitoes. Results Exposure to B. bassiana caused significant mortality and reduced the propensity of mosquitoes to respond and fly to a feeding stimulus. Exposure to M. acridum spores induced a similar decline in feeding propensity, albeit more slowly than B. bassiana exposure. Reduced host-seeking responses following fungal exposure corresponded to reduced olfactory neuron responsiveness in both antennal <b>electroantennogram</b> and maxillary palp electropalpogram recordings. Single cell recordings from neurons on the palps confirmed that fungal-exposed behavioural non-responders exhibited significantly impaired responsiveness of neurons tuned specifically to 1 -octen- 3 -ol and to a lesser degree, to CO 2. Conclusions Fungal infection reduces the responsiveness of mosquitoes to host odour cues, both behaviourally and neuronally. These pre-lethal effects are likely to synergize with fungal-induced mortality to further reduce the capacity of mosquito populations exposed to fungal biopesticides to transmit malaria. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Seven-transmembrane receptors {{typically}} mediate olfactory {{signal transduction}} by coupling to G-proteins. Although insect odorant receptors have seven transmembrane domains like G-protein coupled receptors, {{they have an}} inverted membrane topology and function as ligand-gated cation channels. Consequently, the involvement of cyclic nucleotides and G proteins in insect odor reception is controversial. Since the heterotrimeric G o &# 945; subunit is expressed in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons, we reasoned that G o acts together with insect odorant receptor cation channels to mediate odor-induced physiological responses. Results To test whether G o dependent signaling is involved in mediating olfactory responses in Drosophila, we analyzed <b>electroantennogram</b> and single-sensillum recording from flies that conditionally express pertussis toxin, a specific inhibitor of G o in Drosophila. Pertussis toxin expression in olfactory receptor neurons reversibly reduced the amplitude and hastened the termination of <b>electroantennogram</b> responses induced by ethyl acetate. The frequency of odor-induced spike firing from individual sensory neurons was also reduced by pertussis toxin. These results demonstrate that G o signaling is involved in increasing sensitivity of olfactory physiology in Drosophila. The effect of pertussis toxin was independent of odorant identity and intensity, indicating a generalized involvement of G o in olfactory reception. Conclusion These results demonstrate that G o is required for maximal physiological responses to multiple odorants in Drosophila, and suggest that OR channel function and G-protein signaling are required for optimal physiological responses to odors. </p...|$|E

40|$|A morpho-functional {{investigation}} of the sex pheromone-producing area was correlated with the pheromone release mechanism in the female gypsy moth Lymantria dispar. As assessed by male <b>electroantennograms</b> (EAG) and morphological observations, the pheromone gland consists of a single-layered epithelium both in the dorsal and ventral halves of the intersegmental membrane between the 8 th and 9 th abdominal segments. By using the male EAG as a biosensor of real-time release of sex pheromone from whole calling females, we found this process time coupled with extension movements of the ovipositor. Nevertheless, in females in which normal calling behavior was prevented, pheromone release was detected neither in absence nor in presence of electrical stimulation of the ventral nerve cord/terminal abdominal ganglion (TAG) complex. Tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated dextran amine stainings also confirm {{the lack of any}} innervation of the gland from nerves IV to VI emerging from the TAG. These findings indicate that the release of sex pheromone from the glands in female gypsy moths is independent of any neural control exerted by the TAG on the glands, at least by way of its three most caudally located pairs of nerves, and appears as a consequence of a squeezing mechanism in the pheromone-producing area...|$|R

The template for a single iteration, complete with crosswind casting {{both before and after}} the straighter upwind surging portion, was exhibited by males flying upwind to pheromone and experiencing filament contacts just frequently enough to produce successful upwind flight to the source, as hypothesized by an earlier model. Also as predicted, with more frequent filament contact by males, only the straightest upwind portions of the surges were reiterated, producing direct upwind flight with little crosswind casting. <b>Electroantennogram</b> recordings made from males in free flight upwind in a normal point source pheromone plume further support the idea that a high frequency of filaments encountered under the usual pheromone plume conditions promotes only these repeated straight surges. In-flight <b>electroantennogram</b> recordings also showed that when filament contacts cease, the casting, counterturning program begins to be expressed after a latency period of 0. 30 sec.

The pheromone was extracted from female glands, the active component isolated by coupled gas chromatography– <b>electroantennogram</b> detection analysis, characterized by mass spectrometry, and shown to be active in field tests. The seasonal flight pattern was determined for P. georgiana {{as well as for}} three other species, P. anxia (both northern and southern genitalic forms), P. gracilis, and P. postrema. The latter three species were captured in traps baited with L-isoleucine methyl ester. Keywords L-Valine methyl ester. L-Isoleucine methyl ester...|$|E
40|$|Mating {{is costly}} for {{both male and}} female insects and should {{therefore}} only occur if {{it is likely to be}} successful. Within one scotophase, which is the dark period of the light cycle, male moths can only produce one single spermatophore, which is transferred to the female during mating. Remating within the same scotophase would thus be unsuccessful. We tested the hypothesis that newly mated males of the moth Agrotis ipsilon have developed an energy-saving strategy based on the transient inhibition of their sexual behaviour, thus avoiding unsuccessful remating. Agrotis ipsilon males do not copulate more than once during the same scotophase. Moreover, newly mated males do not respond behaviourally to the female sex pheromone although <b>electroantennograms</b> showed that their peripheral olfactory system is fully functional. However, intracellular recordings of antennal lobe neurons showed that the sensitivity for the synthetic sex pheromone blend decreased as compared with that of unmated males. Both the sexual behaviour and the sensitivity of the antennal lobe neurons were restored when tested during the next scotophase. Our results show a fast, transient neuronal plasticity that 'switches off' the olfactory system, which could prevent males from mating unsuccessfully...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The pheromone-mediated upwind {{flight of}} male turnip moths was {{observed}} in a flight tunnel {{at different times of}} day under conditions of a light-dark (LD) cycle, constant darkness (DD), and a shifted photoperiod. Under both LD and DD conditions, a significantly larger number of males flew to the pheromone during both the scotophase and the subjective scotophase than dur-ing the photophase and the subjective photophase for 2 consecutive days. When 1 -day-old moths were transferred to a shifted LD cycle with lights turned off 4 h earlier, male behavioral responses to the pheromone advanced in time accord-ingly by 4 h. This showed that male behavioral responses to the pheromone are under the control of an endogenous oscillator. To further examine the level at which the circadian rhythm of the male behavioral response is regulated, the authors tested the olfactory responses of male antennal receptors to pheromone stimuli by means of <b>electroantennograms</b> (EAG) at different times of day. No sig-nificant variation in the sensitivity of the male antennal response to the pheromone {{was observed in}} terms of time of day. The results suggest that circa...|$|R
40|$|As adults, {{the summer}} (alate virginopara) and autumn (gynopara) winged {{forms of the}} black bean aphid, Aphis fabae, utilise {{different}} host plants, the bean Vicia faba, and the spindle tree, Euonymus europaeus, respectively. <b>Electroantennograms</b> (EAGs) were recorded from the antennae of these aphid forms, reared from a single clone, to thirty five plant volatiles and to paraffin oil extracts from leaves of the two host plants. The EAG peak responses were normalised against the adjacent responses to a standard stimulus ((E) - 2 -hexenal at log 2 dilution). The comparison of different parameters of the EAG responses, i. e. peak, rise and decay, reveals that peripheral olfactory perception of most volatiles is not significantly different between these two forms. In addition, the responses of adult wingless virginoparae to thirteen of the plant volatiles show, with one exception, similar peripheral perception. The results indicate that any odour discrimination between the two alternative host plants by their respective colonisers is not perceived {{at the level of}} the peripheral olfactory receptors. The EAG response profile of A. fabae differs from that of the vetch aphid, Megoura viciae, which also colonises bean...|$|R
