5000|$|Consequently, since NDF is a [...] "non-cash", <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>item</b> {{and since}} the {{principal}} sums do not move, NDF bears much lower counter-party risk.

50|$|In 1994, {{the foreign}} content limit {{was raised to}} 20%. However, by then, mutual fund {{managers}} {{found a way to}} get around this limitation and offer unitholders exposure to foreign markets without using up any of the foreign content quota. They typically did this by holding all fund assets in Canadian treasury bills or similar cash equivalent assets, and using foreign equity index futures or forward contracts with a similar notional value to obtain equivalent market exposure. Since derivatives are generally considered <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>items</b> for accounting purposes, these synthetic foreign funds qualified as 100% Canadian content.|$|R
40|$|We present new stylized {{facts on}} bank and firm {{leverage}} {{during the period}} 2000 – 2009 using internationally comparable micro level data from many countries. We document the following patterns: a) {{there was an increase}} in leverage for investment banks prior to the sub-prime crisis; b) there was no visible increase in leverage for the typical commercial bank and non-financial firm; c) <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>items</b> constitute a big fraction of assets, especially for large commercial banks in the US, whereas investment banks do not report these items; d) the leverage ratio is procyclical for investment banks and for large commercial banks in the US; e) banks in emerging markets with tighter bank regulation and stronger investor protection experienced significantly less deleveraging during the crisis. The results suggest that excessive risk taking before the crisis was not easily detectable because the risk involved the quality rather than the quantity of assets...|$|R

Five main themes arose: <b>disclosure</b> <b>as</b> the battlefield, preparing psychologically to disclose, <b>disclosure</b> <b>as</b> a test of the partner’s love, <b>disclosure</b> <b>as</b> an opportunity for the partner to know them more deeply, and the renegotiation of the relationship narrative...|$|R
30|$|Liquidity {{creation}} {{is a better}} measure of risk compared to loan growth because it includes both on-balance-sheet <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>off-balance-sheet</b> activities in the formula, but loan growth is based on on-balance-sheet activities only. Furthermore, bank liquidity {{creation is}} a more objective measure of risk taking compared with credit growth because liquidity creation gives us an absolute amount of risk transformation. According to liquidity creation, the overall risk taken by Chinese banks shows a declining trend over the period. Moreover, our results are more reliable because we have used data of 197 banks spanning 10  years, but the abovementioned study used the data of just 87 banks covering 8  years only.|$|R

40|$|Japanese {{banks are}} {{promising}} sources of capital {{for developing countries}} wishing to finance a balance of payments gap. This paper shows that Japanese banks are highly capitalized in terms of market value; much of their capital is"hidden capital,"the divergence between accounting and stock market estimates. The authors developed a method for testing hypotheses about two types of hidden capital: the misvaluation of on-balance-sheet items and intangible values that the General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAPP) currently designates to be unbookable <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>items.</b> They construct a model that explains changes in both types of capital functions of holding-period returns earned in Japan on stocks, bonds, yen, and real estate. They apply the model to annual data for 1975 - 89 and a four-class size/charter participation of the Japanese banking system. For each type of hidden capital and each class of bank, the model develops estimates of the stock market, interest rate, foreign exchange, and real estate sensitivities of returns to bank stockholders. Only the stock market sensitivities prove significant, at 5 percent. Time-series regressions show that the large Japanese banks have developed stock market betas over two and {{that the value of}} the bank's beta has come to increase with measures of its size and accounting leverage.

40|$|Section 1 {{begins by}} {{discussing}} credit card usage and {{the levels of}} debt of American consumers. Section 2 outlines the history of TILA, which was promulgated by Congress in 1968, {{as well as the}} enforcement power bestowed by Congress on the Federal Reserve Board to implement TILA. This exploration also includes descriptions of Regulation Z and the Schumer Box requirements that state exactly what information needs to be clearly and conspicuously displayed in credit card application materials as well as how the information is to be displayed for consumers to review. Section 3 discusses the recent Ninth Circuit case Rubio v. Capital One where the court decided the clarity of <b>disclosure</b> <b>as</b> a question of law.

This study also supports Castaldo et al. (2009) in that consumers perceive a company providing CSR <b>disclosure</b> <b>as</b> more reliable and transparent.

30|$|To {{test the}} {{abovementioned}} hypothesis, {{we used the}} data from 197 listed and unlisted Chinese banks spanning 2005 to 2014. First of all, we calculated the dollar amount of liquidity created by using three step mechanism established by Berger and Bouwman (2009 a). We used “cat fat” measure to calculate the overall liquidity created by on-balance-sheet <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>off-balance-sheet</b> activities and “cat nonfat” measure to compute liquidity creation by on-balance-sheet activities only. To address the possible issue of endogeneity, we used system GMM technique to estimate the effect of NPLs on bank liquidity creation. We found that liquidity creation by Chinese banks {{does not depend on}} level of NPLs, i.e., we did not find the evidence of a moral hazard problem in Chinese banks. To be sure about our findings, we repeated the analysis by using random effect, fixed effect, and pool data techniques. The results obtained by different techniques confirmed our finding that {{there is no evidence of}} a moral hazard problem in Chinese banks.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{measures}} and analyzes {{two types of}} hidden capital at Japanese banks: (1) the net undervaluation present in accounting measures of on-balance-sheet assets and liabilities and (2) the net economic value of <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>items.</b> A model is constructed that explains changes in both types of capital as functions of holding that explains changes in both types of capital as functions of holding-period returns earned in Japan on stocks, bonds, yen, and real estate. The model is applied to annual data covering 1975 - 1989 and a four-class size/charter partition of the Japanese banking system. For each type of hidden capital and each class of bank, the model develops estimates of the stock-market, interest-rate, foreign-exchange, and real estate sensitivities of returns to bank stockholders. Only the stock-market sensitivities prove significant at five percent. This finding leads us to investigate {{what happens when we}} analyze Japanese bank stock returns by means of stationary and split-sample market models. Timeseries regressions show that very large Japanese banks have developed stockmarket betas in excess of two and that the value of a bank's beta has come to increase with measures of its size and accounting leverage. Future research will investigate the sensibility of our results to different ways of pooling data from individual banks and to more-sophisticated methods for estimating various parameters. We also plan to extend the analysis by imbedding it in a model of how variations in bank-customer contracting arrangements in Japan affect the returns that can be earned by bank stockholders. ...|$|R

Delayed sample transactions however are based on knowledge of upcoming announcements, material information which is prohibited. ...|$|R
