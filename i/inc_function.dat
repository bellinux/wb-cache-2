40|$|SummaryChlamydia trachomatis is {{a leading}} cause of genital and ocular infections for which no vaccine exists. Upon entry into host cells, C.  trachomatis resides within a membrane-bound compartment—the {{inclusion}}—and secretes inclusion membrane proteins (Incs) that are thought to modulate the host-bacterium interface. To expand our understanding of <b>Inc</b> <b>function(s),</b> we subjected putative C.  trachomatis Incs to affinity purification-mass spectroscopy (AP-MS). We identified Inc-human interactions for 38 / 58 Incs with enrichment in host processes consistent with Chlamydia’s intracellular life cycle. There is significant overlap between Inc targets and viral proteins, suggesting common pathogenic mechanisms among obligate intracellular microbes. IncE binds to sorting nexins (SNXs) 5 / 6, components of the retromer, which relocalizes SNX 5 / 6 to the inclusion membrane and augments inclusion membrane tubulation. Depletion of retromer components enhances progeny production, revealing that retromer restricts Chlamydia infection.

40|$|The Collie Eye Anomaly is a {{congenital}} disorder {{which is}} equally prevalent in males and females, and among all normal coat colors of Collie dogs. Since {{it was first}} described in 1953, many estimates have been made of its prevalence, ranging from 60 % to over 90 %. From 1975 to June 1979 the Canine Eye Registration Foundation, <b>Inc.</b> (CERF) <b>functioned</b> as a registry for the listing of purebred dogs susceptible to hereditary eye diseases which had been examined by approved veterinary ophthalmologists and found {{to be free of}} such disease. During this period CERF received reports on examinations of a total of 17, 302 Collies. Of these, 12, 465 (72 %) were classificed as affected. The anomaly consists {{of a wide range of}} ocular abnormalities. When severe lesions are present, the affected animal suffers from blindness, but in milder cases, which are by far more common, there are often no outward symptoms. Although Collie Eye is bilaterally expressed, it is usually not symmetrical; an individual may be mildly affected in one eye and severely affected in the other eye. Unlike many other congenital eye diseases, the Collie Eye Anomaly is generally non-progressive. Occasionally, retinal detachment may occur later in life, but usually an affected animal's vision does not worsen with age. Presently, the Collie Eye Anomaly is thought by most people to be due to the presence of a simple autosomal recessive gene; affected animals are presumed to be homozygous for this gene. Because the anomaly has such a high prevalence in the breed, it is assumed that most phenotypically normal-eyed dogs are actually genotypically heterozygous...|$|R

Woodswomen guides completed an extensive guide-training program, focusing on leadership styles, group dynamics. Hollis Giammatteo, writing for Ms. magazine, took a leadership course that included climbing Mount Adams in Washington state. According to Giammatteo, Denise Mitten refined Woodswomen's acclaimed leadership program, creating a style stressing ethical and inclusive leadership. For Woodswomen guides, leadership was viewed as a role that encourages appropriate participation, not as a characteristic of a personality type. The idea rigid of goal-setting and the language of right and wrong were removed. Woodswomen guides, for example, would avoid words that connote domination, such as 'attack the trail,' summit assault,' conquer the mountain.'" [...] Rather, they would say things like [...] "'run the rapids,' 'climb the mountain,' or 'let's start hiking.'"

The chemical composition of the particles was monitored by an aerosol mass spectrometer (Aerodyne Research <b>Inc.)</b> as a <b>function</b> of time and the particle size. Smaller particles were found to contain more organics relative to sulfate than the larger ones. In contrast, the water to sulfate mass ratio was not dependent on the particle size. These experimental findings indicate the formation of organic layers on the particles. With the aid of an aerosol dynamic model we demonstrate that the observations are consistent with the formation of multilayered organic films having thicknesses of approximately 10 nm. The results also suggest that the films were formed through condensation of low-volatile oxidation products that did not take up water considerably. Even though dissolution of oxidation products into the particle aqueous phase cannot be conclusively ruled out, the most plausible interpretation of the results is that the monoterpene ozonolysis lead to the formation of organic coatings on aqueous aerosols.

The simulation software SOLID-CT, commercialized by SIGMA-C permits the influence study of photolithography conditions on few microns pieces of OPC masks. To optimize capabilities of SOLID-CT, we have created an interface with a TCAD simulation environment from Synopsys <b>Inc.</b> The main <b>function</b> of the TCAD software is the prediction of transistors electrical characteristics. The aim of developing such an interface between the two simulation software is to create a powerful and user-friendly simulation platform. The SYNOPSIS tools run with a graphical interface called GENESISe from which different modules can be used. These modules permit for instance to plot the simulated transistors, extract electrical device characteristics, and to visualize 3 D topographies. With this interface, SOLID-CT is integrated as a new module usable under GENESISe. One of the advantages of such interface is the opportunity to obtain electrical characteristics and photolithography process simulations in a single user environment. Another one is the possibility to import under SOLID-CT very accurate models of the wafer stack drawn under SYNOPSIS TCAD. Moreover as GENESISe allows drawing simulation trees in really user-friendly way parameters optimization is improved. This paper presents this new interface, which was installed thanks to ISE support between version 6. 5 of SOLID-CT and 9. 5 of GENESISe.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Statins {{represent}} a pivotal treatment in coronary artery disease, offering {{a reduction in}} cardiovascular risk even beyond their lipid-lowering action. However, the mechanism of these "pleiotropic" benefits of statins is poorly understood. Vitamin D has been suggested as a potential mediator of the anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and vascular protecting effects of statins. Aim of {{present study was to}} assess the impact of a high-intensity statin therapy on vitamin D levels and platelet function in patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS: Patients discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy and high-intensity statins after an ACS or elective PCI were scheduled for main chemistry and vitamin D levels assessment at 30 - 90 days post-discharge. Vitamin D (25 -OHD) dosing was performed by chemiluminescence method through the LIAISON(R) Vitamin D assay (Diasorin <b>Inc).</b> Platelet <b>function</b> was assessed by Multiplate(R) (multiple platelet function analyser; Roche Diagnostics AG). RESULTS: Among 246 patients included, 142 were discharged on a new statin therapy or with an increase in previous dose (Inc-S), while 104 were already receiving a high-dose statin at admission, that remained unchanged (Eq-S). Median follow-up was 75. 5 days. Patients in the Inc-S group were younger (p= 0. 01), smokers (p< 0. 001), with a less frequent history of hypercholesterolemia (p= 0. 05), diabetes (p= 0. 03), hypertension (p= 0. 02), or previous cardiovascular events (p< 0. 001). They were more often admitted for an acute coronary syndrome (p< 0. 001) and used less anti-hypertensive drugs or nitrates. Higher total circulating calcium was observed in the Inc-S group (p= 0. 004), while baseline vitamin D levels were similar in the 2 groups (p= 0. 30). A significant reduction in the circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was observed in the Inc-S group. Vitamin D levels increased in the Inc-S patients but not in the Eq-S group (delta- 25 OHD: 23. 2 +/- 20. 5 % vs 3. 1 +/- 4. 7 %, p= 0. 003), with a linear relationship between the magnitude of vitamin D elevation and the reduction of LDL cholesterol (r=- 0. 17, p= 0. 01). Platelet reactivity was significantly lower in the Inc-S patients, when evaluating aggregation with different platelet activating stimuli (arachidonic acid, p= 0. 02, collagen, p= 0. 004, thrombin-activating peptide, p= 0. 07, ADP, p= 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with coronary artery disease, the addition of a high-intensity statin treatment, besides the lipid-lowering effects, is associated to a significant increase in vitamin D levels and lower platelet reactivity, potentially providing explanation of the "pleiotropic" benefits of statins therapy in cardiovascular disease...|$|R

The theoretical framework used will categorize the actions taken {{on the basis of this}} media monitoring into three levels: sense-making, knowledge creation and decision making. In addition, the utilization of social media monitoring will be glanced at. Method: Three companies are researched from differing industries. 12 people from these three companies were interviewed. The research is qualitative by nature and the interview is semi-structured by form. Findings: The findings portray that information from media monitoring is used always in sense making. The second level, knowledge creation does not occur on every instance and decision making may truly be based on media monitoring on a few accounts. This said, the level of utilization of media monitoring outcomes is related to the job description or function of the employee. Social media is still a difficult concept to approach and guidelines in companies for social media monitoring seem to lack. The main benefit of social media monitoring is providing a new channel for feedback, but due to anonymity this information is hardly reacted to...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the New Zealand merino industry has been {{through a period of}} rapid organizational change and marketing innovation over the past decade. This has seen it move away from a publicly regulated spot auction market structure characterised by undifferentiated product receiving pooled equilibrium commodity prices often at a discount to the international market price to a market structure composed of both privately controlled strongly vertically integrated marketing initiatives characterised by tight contractual relationships gaining substantial premiums over the international market place operating concurrently along side the traditional spot auction markets. The emergence of these new marketing structures has thus forced farmers to seriously re-evaluate {{the manner in which they}} identify with and commit to market channel partners. In the mid 1990 's, the merino sector made an initial effort to move out from under the umbrella of the 'public' statutory control of the New Zealand Wool Board (NZWB) to grower control by establishing a merino-specific 'industry good' organization, Merino New Zealand Incorporated (MNZ Inc). MNZ Inc was established to focus on promotion and management of the merino sectors special characteristics and to maximise opportunities for improving returns to merino growers. MNZ Inc acted as a facilitator in the market, working along-side traditional merino grower servicing and broking companies. The new organization successfully undertook increased commercial responsibility under the NZWB, leading to the formation of Merino New Zealand Limited (MNZ Ltd) in 1998, which took over the majority of MNZ <b>Inc's</b> <b>functions.</b> Finally in 2001, MNZ Ltd and Wrightson Ltd's fine wool business entered into a commercial joint venture, which led to the privatization of the activities of MNZ Ltd. This merger established the New Zealand Merino Company (TNZMC), a privately held joint venture that leveraged MNZ Ltd's marketing expertise and supply chain knowledge, with Wrightson's grower relationships and selling expertise, and the NZWB owned New Zealand Merino brand. As a result of these changes, merino growers presently face a very different marketing landscape in which both traditional and new innovative firms offer a variety of marketing arrangements, ranging from direct auction (spot market) to highly vertically-integrated and relationship-intensive contractual arrangements that link growers to final retail brand partners. The evolving market landscape has forced growers to make a conscious decision about their merino wool marketing practices. They must decide whether to continue marketing their clip through their traditional wool brokers and channels, or to switch allegiances and market their clips through an alternative servicing company or broker. Complicating the growers' dilemma even further, successful initiatives and programs initially developed as an industry public good under MNZ Ltd were transferred to TNZMC, where they are now exclusively available to growers who market their clips through TNZMC. As a result, increased dissent and voice can be heard among some members of the New Zealand merino industry who are disgruntled with the organizational changes. These organizational changes have confronted growers with a number of challenges and questions about how closely they identify with and commit to their chosen servicing company and marketing channel. Merino growers responded to the changes in a number of ways: some have exited their usual servicing company and switched the marketing of their clip to an alternative, some have stayed with their usual servicing company but are unhappy, and some others have stayed with their usual servicing company and are happy. The purpose of this research was to determine how growers now identify with and commit to their respective merino wool servicing and broking companies. A mixed methods approach was implemented to effectively analyze large quantities of qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative data collected in 16 unstructured and semi- structured interviews were synthesized into a case study analyzing changes that took place in the industry and the motivations for those changes. This was followed by an analysis of data collected in an enumerated and stratified survey of 131 New Zealand merino growers conducted in January and February 2004 designed specifically how growers identify with and commit to their merino wool servicing and broking company. Using structural equation modelling techniques, the initial results indicate strongly statistically different structures in the ways in which farmers identify and commit to their respective marketing channels. Farmers who remain within the traditional marketing channels do not identify or commit with the channel from a business stand point, only they only identify and commit on personal relationship basis with their broker/trader who markets their wool. They view all business services provided and market outcomes as equivalent and fair as they are operating in a highly competitive spot auction market and therefore neither their broker or themselves can affect outcomes. Alternatively, farmers whom have switch to the highly integrated and contract controlled channels strongly identify and commit to their marketing channel partners on both a business and personal relationship basis. Interestingly, these results show strong positive business commitment when things are going well, but the reverse when perceptions do not meet expectations. Thus these farmers expect their marketing channels out perform expectations and if they do not they become vocal and begin looking for alternatives. Similar, the way in which the commit differs, the new marketing channels provide a mechanism to learn about the marketing opportunities available but also provide the farmers an opportunity by pass the marketing channel if expectations not meet. This places the marketing channel in a precarious catch 22 position of being required to continuously provide up to date information about the market to ensure farmers maintain realistic expectations and thus ensure that they remain but at the same time not give away too much information thereby allowing them to operate by themselves.
