5|$|In {{order to}} promote Rock 'n' Roll Circus, Hamasaki {{conducted}} several commercial endorsement opportunities and expanded several other ventures. Hamasaki opened two special websites to document her preparation for the Rock 'n' Roll Circus concert tour, and additional promotional activity. On {{the day of the}} album's release, Hamasaki was interviewed by Yahoo! Music Japan and Myspace to talk about the album's material and further promotional activity. Hamasaki also received exclusive deals to promote Rock 'n' Roll Circus through mobile phones, including the Japanese services SNS and Utapiku. One day after the album's domestic release, Hamasaki began expanding her online presence by setting up accounts on MySpace, Ustream, and Twitter to promote the album and interact with her fan base. Hamasaki renewed her contract with British cosmetics line Rimmel as an ode to her <b>image</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> album; she was part of several campaigns through 2010.|$|E

The first Shuttle mission, STS-1, had a protruding gap filler that diverted hot gas into the right wheel well on re-entry, resulting in a buckling of the right main landing gear door.|$|E

The pity in the subject comes to viewers subliminally through a visual poem of complexity and power.|$|E
25|$|A TEM is {{composed}} of several components, which include a vacuum {{system in which the}} electrons travel, an electron emission source for generation of the electron stream, a series of electromagnetic lenses, as well as electrostatic plates. The latter two allow the operator to guide and manipulate the beam as required. Also required is a device to allow the insertion into, motion within, and removal of specimens from the beam path. Imaging devices are subsequently used to create an <b>image</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> electrons that exit the system.|$|E
25|$|In {{practical}} helical cone beam X-ray CT machines, {{the source}} and array of detectors are mounted on a rotating gantry while the patient is moved axially at a uniform rate. Earlier X-ray CT scanners imaged one slice at a time by rotating source and one-dimensional array of detectors while the patient remained static. The helical scan method reduces the X-ray dose to the patient required for a given resolution while scanning more quickly. This is, however, {{at the cost of}} greater mathematical complexity in the reconstruction of the <b>image</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> measurements.|$|E

25|$|Fingerprint {{processing}} {{has three}} primary functions: enrollment, searching and verification. Among these functions, enrollment which captures fingerprint <b>image</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sensor {{plays an important}} role. A {{reason is that the}} way people put their fingerprints on a mirror to scan can affect to the result in the searching and verifying process. Regarding to verification function, there are several techniques to match fingerprints such as correlation-based matching, minutiae-based matching, ridge feature-based matching and minutiae-based algorithm. However, the most popular algorithm was minutiae based matching algorithm due to its efficiency and accuracy.|$|E
25|$|The {{still of}} William Hartnell (First Doctor) {{is the first}} image of the actor to be {{presented}} in high-resolution colour. To create the image, director Matt Lossaso sourced a black-and-white <b>image</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> episode The Web Planet (1965), and spent hours placing elements from a double {{over the top of}} the original still in Adobe Photoshop to manipulate the image to colour. Following this, Framestore visual effects supervisor Oliver Bersey added slight edits, before adding subtle 2D manipulations to give a 3D effect. Bersey also created a matte painting of the vast landscape that appears at the end of the trailer.|$|E
25|$|After his death, {{his image}} {{continued}} {{to be used in}} commercials, such as a 2000 campaign for Schick razors using his <b>image</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Tantei Monogatari television series.

In 1998, a film called Yomigaeru Yūsaku: Tantei Monogatari Tokubetsu-hen was released, containing two episodes of the Tantei Monogatari television series and some additional material. In 2009, his second wife, Miyuki Matsuda, produced a tribute film, Soul Red, including clips from his films and interviews with actors such as Andy Garcia, as well as his two sons.|$|E
