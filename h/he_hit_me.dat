500|$|On September 23, 2010, rapper Q-Tip {{confirmed}} {{working on}} Jay-Z's twelfth [...] studio album, with a tentative release in 2011. By May 2012, reports arose {{that he was}} working on new music with Roc Nation producer Jahlil Beats. In an interview with XXL, Beats stated: [...] "Me and Jay-Z been going back and forth. He picked a couple of my joints that he's working on. I don't even wanna say too much about Jay, but we definitely working on some stuff. I haven't even sent him a bunch of beats. I sent him my favorite stuff. <b>He</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> right back like, 'Yo, I'ma go in on this,' or, 'I like this.'" [...] The album development was kept a secret, but The-Dream hinted about a new Jay-Z album in an April 2013 interview with Hot 97.|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "He {{was on a}} mission today, that's for sure. When Jeff Gordon has a good car {{and he has the}} opportunity to beat you, he's going to beat you. He's my hero. I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years." [...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. <b>He</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E
500|$|Massa denied responsibility, {{and agreed}} with the stewards' decision: [...] "I think there's little to say: I had already entered the turn and <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> from behind, {{spinning}} me round." [...] The penalty was largely criticized in the media. GrandPrix.com called the penalty [...] "bizarre", saying that Bourdais [...] "could not just disappear". James Allen of ITV said that in light of FIA race director Charlie Whiting's announcement prior to the race, which indicated that cars exiting the pit-lane would have right of way, the penalty was [...] "ridiculous". French sporting newspaper L'Équipe criticized the stewards for their intervention, saying that both drivers held their lines and the collision was just a racing incident. Mark Blundell, who drove in Formula One for five years, called for former drivers {{to be part of}} the stewards meetings which award penalties: [...] "You can examine pieces of paper, graphs, telemetry, but you don't know what's going on in a driver's brain until you've experienced it." [...] Blundell's suggestion eventually became fact - the 2010 season introduced a system whereby a former F1 driver acted as a steward during each Grand Prix.|$|E
60|$|Afore I {{could put}} my 'ands up <b>he</b> <b>'it</b> <b>me</b> {{hard in the}} mouth, and the next moment we was at it as 'ard as we could go. Nearly every time I <b>hit</b> 'im <b>he</b> wasn't there, and every time <b>'e</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> I wished I hadn't ha' been. When I said I had 'ad enough, 'e contradicted me and kept on, but he got tired of it at last, and, arter telling me wot he would do if I ever walked 'is wife out agin, they went off like a couple o' love-birds.|$|R

5000|$|Ruman {{said during}} a post-race interview, which aired on CBS Sports Network: [...] "Tomy Drissi is the most un{{professional}}, unsportsmanlike, unimaginable, worst driver {{in what he calls}} a professional sport. What he did was unacceptable today, he trashed my car, he blocked us, we were winning the championship, this is the third year in a row <b>he's</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> has a vendetta against me. He's unprofessional and it's unacceptable what happened here today." ...|$|R
2500|$|After leaving Parliament, Johnson {{continued}} {{as a local}} solicitor, and directed his political energies towards animal rights campaigning. He worked with Donald Chapman, a Labour MP, going to campaign against fox hunts, which outraged the huntsman. On 29 October 1959 the Southdown hunt with 14 hounds charged into Johnson's [...] garden at Ditchling in Sussex, wrecking the hedges and damaging crops. When one huntsman dismounted and advanced on Johnson brandishing his riding crop and threatening to [...] "teach him a lesson", Johnson urged the man to hit him and promised to keep {{his hands behind his}} back if he did. Johnson remarked [...] "I told him it would suit me admirably if <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me,</b> as it would show others what hunting people are like." [...] Instead the man rode off.|$|E
2500|$|Jimmy Jacobs, who co-managed Mike Tyson, used a {{synchronizer}} {{to measure}} young Ali's punching speed versus Sugar Ray Robinson, a welter/middleweight who was considered pound-for-pound the best fighter in history. Ali was 25% faster than Robinson, even though Ali was 45–50pounds heavier. Ali's punches produced approximately 1,000pounds of force. [...] "No matter what his opponents heard about him, they didn't realize how fast he was {{until they got}} in the ring with him", Jacobs said. The effect of Ali's punches was cumulative. Charlie Powell, who fought Ali early in Ali's career and was knocked out in the third round, said: [...] "When he first hit me I said to myself, 'I can take two of these to get one in myself.' But {{in a little while}} I found myself getting dizzier and dizzier every time <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me.</b> He throws punches so easily that you don't realize how much they hurt you until it's too late." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{roughly the}} next decade Gordon {{controlled}} Jackson with threats, lies, and routine domestic violence. According to Jackson, [...] "When <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me,</b> the first time I was in shock, I just recalled my ear ringing, just ringing so hard." [...] Gordon confiscated Jackson's passport, transferred her bank accounts into his name, hired bodyguards to watch La Toya constantly and banned her from speaking to or seeing her family, monitoring her every phone call. La Toya's father Joseph stated in his book The Jacksons that he believed Gordon brainwashed La Toya and made her fearful of her own family. Katherine also believed that La Toya had been brainwashed while Gordon claimed that Katherine had tried to kill her daughter. Sister Janet concurred with her parents saying at the time, [...] "I think this guy who is with her has brainwashed her and made her like this... He keeps {{her away from the}} family, and now he's brainwashed her so much she keeps herself away from us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why {{did your}} uncle attach such a cruel {{condition}} to his bounty?' she cried bitterly. 'O, he little thinks how hard <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> <b>me</b> from the grave--me, {{who have never}} done him wrong; and you, too! Swithin, {{are you sure that}} he makes that condition indispensable? Perhaps he meant that you should not marry beneath you; perhaps he did not mean to object in such a case as your marrying (forgive me for saying it) a little above you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'It's</b> me,' <b>he</b> said; <b>'it's</b> <b>me</b> all the time. I wish I'd {{seen this}} before I put on the punk I'm doing now. This is me from the drive off the tee. It's great! Say, what'll you have?' ...|$|R
3000|$|... “When {{he wants}} money {{he can do}} anything. <b>He</b> has <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> so many times. He has been very abusive and later on he has said sorry. But at that time, he owes the money and if I don't {{give it to him}} he becomes {{absolutely}} wild.” [...]...|$|R
2500|$|On December 2, 2006, Quintana fought fellow undefeated Puerto Rican Cotto, {{who moved}} up in weight from Jr. Welterweight. Quintana started the fight boxing and {{connecting}} right jabs, the round concluded with both users exchanging combinations. This pattern {{continued in the}} second round, with Cotto connecting two solid body punches to Quintana. Quintana began the third round connecting a solid jab to Cotto's face, but the round concluded with Cotto connecting several combinations to the body. In the fifth round Cotto had control of the fight's tempo, and connected several combinations to the body, scoring a knockdown while switching between the orthodox and southpaw stances. Between rounds Quintana indicated that {{he was unable to}} continue, the corner wanted to continue but Quintana was unresponsive when the referee asked if he wanted to proceed. The fight was stopped and Cotto was declared the winner, when interviewed Quintana noted that he: [...] "underestimated his velocity. He has very quick hands, you have to give all the respect to Miguel, he's very fast and <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> pretty good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Less than 24 {{hours after}} Jackson's death, [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] was {{released}} by Diddy on his Twitter account. [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] made its debut on the morning radio show [...] "Big Boy's Neighborhood" [...] {{as well as on}} Game affiliate DJ Skee's satellite radio show, [...] "Skeetox." [...] DJ Skee, said of being {{one of the first to}} give the song radio airplay, [...] "I told Game yesterday that Michael Jackson died, and he didn't believe me. He said, 'I'll call you right back. Then this morning, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> with this track, and I immediately started blasting it out." [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] was also released as a digital download. [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] did not chart on any music charts from radio play or digital download sales. [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] was received well by contemporary music critics. Rahman Dukes and Shaheem Reid, of MTV, described [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] as a being a [...] "heartfelt tribute".|$|E
2500|$|On September 23, 2010, Q-Tip {{confirmed}} {{working on}} Jay-Z's follow up album to The Blueprint 3, saying {{the album was}} to hit stores by spring 2011. In May 2012 {{it was reported that}} Jay-Z would work on new music with Roc Nation producer Jahlil Beats. Beats told XXL: [...] "Me and Jay-Z been going back and forth.

[...] The album has been named one of the most anticipated albums of 2013 by Complex Magazine, MTV, and XXL Magazine. Production will come from Jahlil Beats, Kanye West, Rick Rubin, Swizz Beatz, Timbaland, and Pharrell Williams. Jay-Z also made an appearance on Justin Timberlake's comeback single [...] "Suit & Tie" [...] from his third studio album The 20/20 Experience, the song itself was produced by both Jay-Z and Timberlake's mutual friend, Timbaland. During the fifth game of the 2013 NBA Finals, Carter announced his twelfth studio album, Magna Carta Holy Grail, and was released on July 4, 2013. Not long after, Jay-Z confirmed that the hyphen in his stage name would be left out and officially stylized in all capital letters [...] Magna Carta Holy Grail debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 528,000 copies in its first week, which bypassed its predicted debut in the range of 350,000 to 400,000.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't think so," [...] Amuba gasped. [...] "The brute has knocked all {{the breath}} {{out of my}} body; but that's better than if <b>he</b> had <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> in the leg, for I {{think he would have}} broken it had he done so. How is the woman--is she dead?" ...|$|R
2500|$|He told a {{story in}} the words of the great man: [...] "Ah hit George Hirst bang on't kneecap; and Ah'll swear to me dying day he was in front – ball would a knocked all 3 stumps down. But umpire gives it [...] "not out" [...] and then George <b>hits</b> <b>me</b> over the ropes and t'crowd sarcastic like shouts [...] "Ow's That?" [...] and next ball <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> <b>me</b> again over the ropes and crowd shouts [...] "Ow's that?" [...] again so I knocked his middle stump flying in two and Ah brandishes 'em at crowd. [...] And then I runs off field and comes back with six new stumps and gives em to umpire and says, [...] "Here take these, [...] you'll need all bloody lot before Ah've done." [...] And he need four on em, Ah can tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{took me by}} {{the sleeve}} with a nod and a wink, and led me quietly outside Hope Park. But no sooner were we beyond {{the view of the}} promenaders than the fashion of his countenance changed. [...] "You tam lowland scoon'rel!" [...] cries <b>he,</b> and <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> a buffet on the jaw with his closed fist.|$|R
60|$|LARRY. <b>He</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me.</b> [He {{holds up}} his hands] I didn't know I was so strong.|$|E
60|$|When he {{was within}} {{three feet of}} me he aimed a blow at my head. Had <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me,</b> I am certain he would have cracked my skull open.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{explains}} it, then. I don't blame Troop any. I {{just said}} I wouldn't work--on a Banker, too--and of course <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> on the nose, and oh! I bled like a stuck hog." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No {{doubt you}} {{spend much of}} your time in reading, Mistress Ruth,' <b>he</b> remarked. <b>'It</b> puzzles <b>me</b> to think what else you can do so far from town?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No--Paris,' <b>he</b> resumed, <b>'it</b> makes <b>me</b> sick. Pah--l'amour. I detest it. L'amour, l'amore, die Liebe--I detest it {{in every}} language. Women and love, {{there is no}} greater tedium,' he cried.|$|R

6000|$|... "No fear. He'll knock {{us about}} a bit, but he don't want a rope round his neck, you be sure. And he ain't so bad neither, when he's not in the drink. He's sorry <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} funning," [...] says he sullenly. [...] "I didn't mean to hurt Old Hank. But what did <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> for? I'll behave, Snake-eye, if you won't send me home, and if you'll {{let me play}} the Black Scout to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. He {{struck me}} down, and then lit {{the bit of}} tallow candle you see lying there. Then we struggled, and <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> again, {{and that is all}} I know.

6000|$|... 'I {{hated it}} at the time, but I can see it was necessary,' <b>he</b> said. <b>'It</b> brought <b>me</b> into line a bit--and you can't live unless you do come into line somewhere.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Stow it!' <b>he</b> says; <b>'it</b> makes <b>me</b> shiver {{for fear}} {{it might come}} true. I'm not cut out for a respectable cove, and I won't be one neither, if I can help it!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'It</b> reminds me,' <b>he</b> said, <b>'it</b> reminds <b>me</b> {{strongly}} of the Island-Valley of Avilion, where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, nor ever {{wind blows}} loudly; but it lies deep-meadow'd, happy, fair, with orchard lawns....' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You young dog,' {{the skipper}} said, 'you've been shamming {{for the last}} six weeks. I reckon I'll sharpen you up now,' and <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> a heavy blow with a rattan he held in his hand. There was a cry of 'Shame!' from some of the men. As quick as thought the skipper pulled a pistol from his pocket.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he opened}} me {{and looked down}} me, and {{clutched}} hold of my wrist, and then <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> over the chest when I wasn’t expecting it—a cowardly thing to do, I call it—and immediately afterwards butted me with {{the side of his}} head. After that, he sat down and wrote out a prescription, and folded it up and gave it me, and I put it in my pocket and went out.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{took the}} paper he handed out {{and started to}} look at some writing on it which was very indistinct.

6000|$|The {{veins in}} Cramier's {{forehead}} were swollen, {{his face and}} neck had grown crimson.

If he could strangle, and have done with him! ...|$|R
