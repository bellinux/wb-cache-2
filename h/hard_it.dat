5|$|Now Sunderland {{found out}} how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> is to score against this terrific defence of ours. Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. What can I say {{to do justice to}} that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once again they mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors to destroy it.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{moved into}} a very basic ground-floor {{apartment}} in London, on Clarendon Road, Notting Hill. Given how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> was to find decent housing, they decided instead to share with Helge Rubinstein and her husband, the literary agent Hilary Rubinstein, {{who at the time}} was working for his uncle, Victor Gollancz. In 1955 the four of them bought a four-storey, seven-bedroom house in Phillimore Place, Kensington, for ₤6,800, a home they lived in together for 14 years. Williams described it as one of the happiest periods of his life.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} league {{pitching}} appearance of Musial's career occurred as {{a publicity stunt}} during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season. Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season. With Baumholtz batting right-handed {{for the first time}} in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner. The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.|$|E

25|$|After the funeral, Kōichi, Shige and Keizō leave immediately, {{with only}} Noriko not returning. After they leave, Kyōko is angry {{with them and}} voices her {{complaints}} to Noriko about her siblings by deriding them over being selfish to their family. She believes that Kōichi, Shige and Keizō don't care how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> was for their father when he lost their mother. Kyōko believes that strangers and even Noriko would've been more respectful towards her. Noriko responds that while she understands Kyoko's disappointment with her siblings, she also explains that everyone has their own life to lead and that the drift {{between parents and children}} is inevitable. She convinces Kyoko not to be too harsh on her siblings because one day she too will understand how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> is for them to have to take time from both their families and their own lives.|$|E

25|$|The blower {{was driven}} from the rods linking the {{cylinders}} to the wheels, thus the draught was {{proportional to the}} speed of the engine, not to how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> is working as with a blastpipe. It is assumed that either the blower was worked by hand when the engine was standing or the drive wheels were lifted off the rails. Details of the blower design are not known for certain.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{application}} of case-hardening is on screws, particularly self-drilling screws. In {{order for the}} screws {{to be able to}} drill, cut and tap into other materials like steel, the drill point and the forming threads must be harder than the material(s) that it is drilling into. However, if the whole screw is uniformly <b>hard,</b> <b>it</b> will become very brittle and it will break easily. This is overcome by ensuring that only the case is hardened and the core remains relatively soft. For screws and fasteners, case-hardening is achieved by a simple heat treatment consisting of heating and then quenching.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, she {{was cast}} as Andie Walsh in another successful Hughes film called Pretty In Pink (1986). Ringwald's role as Andie {{went on to}} become one of her most recognizable performances. When first asked to be in Pretty in Pink, Ringwald was reluctant, but after seeing how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> was for the producers to find a replacement for her, she decided she would portray Andie in the film. Ringwald was offered a role in another John Hughes film called Some Kind of Wonderful (1987) but she turned down the role as she felt it was too similar to her other films she worked on with Hughes. After Pretty In Pink, Ringwald planned to star in more mature roles. Ringwald was later featured on the cover of Time magazine on May 26, 1986.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between virulence and transmission is complex, and has important {{consequences for the}} long term evolution of a pathogen. Since it takes many generations for a microbe and a new host species to co-evolve, an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially <b>hard.</b> <b>It</b> is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can be passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing and coughing create infectious aerosols).|$|E
25|$|The scene changes {{again to}} a fairy garden with a palace in the {{background}} out of which Ada comes. She sings of how she is willing to sacrifice her immortality and pay the price, however <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> is, necessary to win Arindal (Wie muss ich doch beklagen). Arindal awakens and declares his joy at seeing Ada again, but she announces that he will abandon her the next day. Gernot, Gunther and Morald arrive with companions to fetch Arindal. Those who have not seen her before are struck by Ada's beauty and fear Arindal will not come. A procession of fairies {{comes out of the}} palace and Zemina and Farzana tell Ada that her father has died and she is now queen. Ada tells Arindal that they must part now but she will see him tomorrow. She asks him to swear that whatever happens he will not curse her. He swears it even though she takes back her request. She expresses her fear that they will both go under {{as a result of his}} breaking the oath.|$|E

25|$|The LaGG-3 rapidly {{replaced}} the LaGG-1, although the new fighter {{was too heavy}} for its engine. In fact, Lavochkin, Gorbunov and Gudkov had originally designed their prototype for the powerful Klimov M-106 engine, but {{it proved to be}} unreliable, so they were obliged to install the relatively weak Klimov M-105P. As a result, the LaGG was slow; its top speed was just 575km/h, while its rate of climb, at ground level, was as slow as 8.5 meters/second. The LaGG-3 proved to be somewhat hard to control as it reacted sluggishly to stick forces. In particular, it was difficult to pull out of a dive, and if the stick was pulled too <b>hard,</b> <b>it</b> tended to fall into a spin. As a consequence, sharp turns were difficult to perform. A more powerful version of the engine was installed, but the improvement was small, so the only solution was to lighten the airframe. The LaGG team re-examined the design and pared down the structure as much as possible. Automatic slats were added to the wings to improve climb and maneuverability and further weight was saved by installing lighter armament (most versions used a 20mm ShVAK cannon and a single synchronized 12.7mm Berezin UBS machine gun). But the improvement was slight and, thus, without an alternative powerplant, when the LaGG-3 was first committed to combat in July 1941, it was completely outclassed by the Messerschmitt Bf 109.|$|E
