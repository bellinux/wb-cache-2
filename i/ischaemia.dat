5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to <b>ischaemia</b> of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E

25|$|Avascular {{necrosis}} (aseptic bone necrosis) {{of the hip}} {{and other}} major joints may occur {{as a result of}} <b>ischaemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brain {{ischemia}} {{is characterized}} by insufficient {{blood flow to the}} brain. Studies with ischaemic gerbils indicate that, after a delay, levels of quinolinic acid significantly increase, which correlates with increased neuronal damage. In addition, researchers have found that, after transient global <b>ischaemia,</b> there are microglia containing quinolinic acid within the brain. Following cerebral <b>ischaemia,</b> delayed neuronal death may occur in part because of central microglia and macrophages, which possess and secrete quinolinic acid. This delayed neurodegeneration could be associated with chronic brain damage that follows a stroke.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in 1997 found an inverse association between death from coronary heart disease and frequency of orgasm even given the risk that myocardial <b>ischaemia</b> and myocardial infarction can be triggered by sexual activity.|$|E
25|$|Steroid {{therapy is}} also {{controversial}} {{in many cases}} of CST. However, corticosteroids are absolutely indicated in cases of pituitary insufficiency. Corticosteroid use may have {{a critical role in}} patients with Addisonian crisis secondary to <b>ischaemia</b> or necrosis of the pituitary that complicates CST.|$|E
25|$|Richter's hernia: a hernia {{involving}} {{only one}} sidewall of the bowel, which {{can result in}} bowel strangulation leading to perforation through <b>ischaemia</b> without causing bowel obstruction or any of its warning signs. It is named after German surgeon August Gottlieb Richter (1742–1812).|$|E
25|$|Myocardial {{cells are}} exposed to {{different}} environments. Normal cells may be exposed to hyperkalaemia; abnormal cells may be perfused by normal environment. For example, with a healed myocardial infarction, abnormal cells can be exposed to an abnormal environment such as with a myocardial infarction with myocardial <b>ischaemia.</b> In conditions such as myocardial <b>ischaemia,</b> possible mechanism of arrhythmia generation include the resulting decreased internal K+ concentration, the increased external K+ concentration, norepinephrine release and acidosis. When myocardial cell {{are exposed to}} hyperkaliemia, the maximum diastolic potential is depolarized {{as a result of}} the alteration of Ik1 potassium current, whose intensity and direction is strictly dependent on intracellular and extracellular potassium concentrations. With Ik1 suppressed, an hyperpolarizing effect is lost and therefore there can be activation of funny current even in myocardial cells (which is normally suppressed by the hyperpolarizing effect of coexisting potassium currents). This can lead to the instauration of automaticity in ischemic tissue.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{conditions}} {{affecting the}} bowels include infectious diarrhoea and mesenteric <b>ischaemia.</b> Causes of constipation may include faecal impaction and bowel obstruction, which may in turn {{be caused by}} ileus, intussusception, volvulus. Inflammatory bowel disease is a condition of unknown aetiology, classified as either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, that can affect the intestines {{and other parts of}} the gastrointestinal tract. Other causes of illness include intestinal pseudoobstruction, and necrotizing enterocolitis.|$|E
25|$|Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome, {{also known}} as Wyburn-Mason syndrome, is a rare congential {{arteriovenous}} malformation of the brain, retina or facial nevi. The syndrome {{has a number of}} possible symptoms and can affect the skin, bones, kidneys, muscles, and gastrointestinal tract. When the syndrome affects the brain, people can experience severe headaches, seizures, acute stroke, meningism and progressive neurological deficits due to acute or chronic <b>ischaemia</b> caused by arteriovenous shunting.|$|E
25|$|Other {{factors such}} as toxicants can {{adversely}} impact bone cells. Infections, chronic or acute, can affect blood flow by inducing platelet activation and aggregation, contributing to a localized state of excess coagulability (hypercoagulability) that may contribute to clot formation (thrombosis), a known cause of bone infarct and <b>ischaemia.</b> Exogenous estrogens, also called hormonal disruptors, have been linked with an increased tendency to clot (thrombophilia) and impaired bone healing.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) features/symptoms of Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc {{syndrome}} is highly dependent of the location of the cerebral AVMs and the {{extent of the}} malformation. The most common symptom affecting the CNS is an intracranial hemangioma in the midbrain. Along with hemangiomas, the malformations result in severe headaches, cerebral hemorrhages, vomiting, meningism, seizures, acute strokes or progressive neurological deficits due to acute or chronic <b>ischaemia</b> caused by arteriovenous shunting.|$|E
25|$|The loss of {{red blood}} cell {{elasticity}} {{is central to the}} pathophysiology of sickle-cell disease. Normal {{red blood cell}}s are quite elastic, which allows the cells to deform to pass through capillaries. In sickle-cell disease, low oxygen tension promotes red blood cell sickling and repeated episodes of sickling damage the cell membrane and decrease the cell's elasticity. These cells fail to return to normal shape when normal oxygen tension is restored. As a consequence, these rigid blood cells are unable to deform as they pass through narrow capillaries, leading to vessel occlusion and <b>ischaemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Local {{anesthetic}} toxicity {{is indicated}} by numbness and tingling around the mouth, metallic taste, or ringing in the ears. Additionally, this may lead to seizures, arrhythmias, and may progress to cardiac arrest. This reaction may stem from an allergy, excessive dose, or intravascular injection. Other complications include nerve injury which has an extremely low rate of 0.029-0.2%. Some research even suggests that ultrasound lowers the risk to 0.0037%. The use of ultrasound and nerve stimulation has greatly improved practitioners’ ability to safely administer nerve blocks. Nerve injury most often occurs from <b>ischaemia,</b> compression, direct neurotoxicity, or needle laceration, and inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Heavy metals such as {{lead and}} cadmium have {{been implicated in}} osteoporosis. Cadmium and lead {{promotes}} the synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) which is the major inhibitor of fibrinolysis (the mechanism by which the body breaks down clots) and {{shown to be a}} cause of hypofibrinolysis. Persistent blood clots can lead to congestive blood flow (hyperemia) in bone marrow, impaired blood flow and <b>ischaemia</b> in bone tissue resulting in lack of oxygen (hypoxia), bone cell damage and eventual cell death (apoptosis). Of significance {{is the fact that the}} average concentration of cadmium in human bones in the 20th century has increased to about 10 times above the pre-industrial level.|$|E
25|$|Ischaemia/infarction: if an {{arterial}} thrombus {{cannot be}} lysed {{by the body}} {{and it does not}} embolise, and if the thrombus is large enough to impair or occlude blood flow in the involved artery, then local <b>ischaemia</b> or infarction will result. A venous thrombus {{may or may not be}} ischaemic, since veins distribute deoxygenated blood that is less vital for cellular metabolism. Nevertheless, non-ischaemic venous thrombosis may still be problematic, due to the swelling caused by blockage to venous drainage. In deep vein thrombosis this manifests as pain, redness, and swelling; in retinal vein occlusion this may result in macular oedema and visual acuity impairment, which if severe enough can lead to blindness.|$|E
25|$|As with {{myocardial}} <b>ischaemia</b> {{referred pain}} {{in a certain}} portion of the body {{can lead to a}} diagnosis of the correct local center. Somatic mapping of referred pain and the corresponding local centers has led to various topographic maps being produced to aid in pinpointing the location of pain based on the referred areas. For example, local pain stimulated in the esophagus is capable of producing referred pain in the upper abdomen, the oblique muscles, and the throat. Local pain in the prostate can radiate referred pain to the abdomen, lower back, and calf muscles. Kidney stones can cause visceral pain in the ureter as the stone is slowly passed into the excretory system. This can cause immense referred pain in the lower abdominal wall.|$|E
25|$|The vaso-occlusive {{crisis is}} caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells that obstruct {{capillaries}} and restrict blood flow to an organ resulting in <b>ischaemia,</b> pain, necrosis, and often organ damage. The frequency, severity, and duration of these crises vary considerably. Painful crises are treated with hydration, analgesics, and blood transfusion; pain management requires opioid administration at regular intervals until the crisis has settled. For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manage on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac or naproxen. For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids; patient-controlled analgesia devices are commonly used in this setting. Vaso-occlusive crisis involving organs such as the penis or lungs are considered an emergency and treated with red-blood cell transfusions. Incentive spirometry, a technique to encourage deep breathing to minimise the development of atelectasis, is recommended.|$|E
500|$|In late 2006, the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology {{published}} {{the result of}} studies conducted at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai that showed the beneficial relationship of resveratrol, a compound found in all red wine, in reducing the risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease. The study showed that resveratrol found in Cabernet Sauvignon can reduce levels of amyloid beta peptides, which attack brain cells and {{are part of the}} [...] of Alzheimer's. Resveratrol has also been shown to promote the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides. It has also been shown that non-alcoholic extracts of Cabernet Sauvignon protect hypertensive rats during <b>ischaemia</b> and reperfusion.|$|E

2500|$|Binge {{drinking}} is {{also associated with}} strokes and sudden death. Binge drinking {{increases the risk of}} stroke by 10 times. In countries where binge {{drinking is}} commonplace, rates of sudden death on the weekend in young adults and middle aged people increase significantly. The withdrawal phase after an episode of binge drinking is particularly associated with ischaemic stroke as well as subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracerebral haemorrhage in younger men. In individuals with an underlying cardiac disorder a binge on alcohol increases the risk of silent myocardial <b>ischaemia</b> as well as angina. Binge drinking has negative effects on metabolism, lipid profile, blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, blood pressure and vascular tone and is associated with embolic stroke and acute myocardial infarction. Due to these risks experts believe that it is extremely important to warn people of the risks of binge drinking. Binge-drinking by people otherwise considered to be light drinkers is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems and [...] Binge drinking increases cardiovascular toxicity due to its adverse effects on the electrical conduction system of the heart and the process of atherothrombosis. Excessive alcohol consumption is responsible for an average of 80,000 deaths in the U.S. each year1 and $223.5 billion in economic costs in 2006.2 More than half of these deaths and three-quarters of the economic costs are due to binge drinking1 and 2 (≥4 drinks for women; ≥5 drinks for men, per occasion).|$|E
50|$|Critical limb <b>ischaemia</b> is {{different}} from acute limb <b>ischaemia.</b> Acute limb <b>ischaemia</b> is a sudden lack of {{blood flow to the}} limb, for example caused by an embolus whereas critical limb <b>ischaemia</b> is a late sign of a progressive chronic disease.|$|E
50|$|In {{the worst}} cases acute limb <b>ischaemia</b> {{progresses}} to critical limb <b>ischaemia,</b> {{and results in}} death or limb loss. Early detection and steps towards fixing the problem with limb-sparing techniques can salvage the limb. Compartment syndrome can occur because of acute limb <b>ischaemia</b> because of the biotoxins that accumulate distal to the occlusion resulting in edema.|$|E
