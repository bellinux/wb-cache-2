Assi was very methodical in his lectures, making no digressions to answer questions not germane to the subject under discussion; and whenever such were propounded to him, he put off reply {{until he reached the}} subject to which they related (Yer. Shab. xix. 16d; Yer. Er. vi. 24a).|$|E
25|$|Since its inception, the Anglican communion has {{maintained}} an evening office, {{which is called}} evening prayer (or evensong). There are prescribed forms of the service in the Anglican prayer book. A similar form of the service {{is found in the}} Vespers section of The Lutheran Hymnal. The Anglican breviary contains Vespers in English according to the pre-1970 Roman rite. For <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> service, see above, as in the Roman breviary. The Liberal Catholic Rite also includes Vespers, including the Te Deum {{as an alternative to the}} Magnificat.|$|E
25|$|What {{resulted}} was {{a perfect}} storm that almost completely destroyed the BBS market through 1995. Technically, Internet service offered an enormous advantage over BBS systems, as a single connection to the user's Internet service provider allowed them to contact services around the world. In comparison, BBS systems relied on a direct point-to-point connection, so even dialing multiple local systems required multiple phone calls. Moreover, Internet protocols allowed that same single connection {{to be used to}} contact multiple services at the same time, say download files from an FTP library while checking the weather on a local news web site. In comparison, a connection to a BBS allowed access only to the <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> system.|$|E

The Collector's Edition was revealed on May 11, 2010. It was distributed worldwide and is available for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Its enclosed contents include seven real clay poker chips from the Fallout: New Vegas casinos, {{a deck of cards}} each with a character on them with <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> person, a graphic novel leading up to the events of New Vegas, a Lucky 38 large platinum chip replica, and a making-of documentary.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{drawback}} {{of systematic}} sampling {{is that even}} in scenarios where it is more accurate than SRS, its theoretical properties {{make it difficult to}} quantify that accuracy.

2500|$|The game {{includes}} both the [...] "real world" [...] {{of the camp}} and its surroundings, {{as well as a}} number of [...] "mental worlds" [...] which exist in the consciousness of the game's various characters. The mental worlds have wildly differing art and level design aesthetics, but generally have a specific goal that Raz must complete to help resolve a psychological issue a character may have, allowing the game's plot to progress. Within the mental worlds are censors that react negatively to Raz's presence and will attack him. There are also various collectibles within the mental worlds, including [...] "figments" [...] of the character's imagination which help increase Raz's psi ranking, [...] "emotional baggage" [...] which can be sorted by finding tags and bringing them to the baggage, and [...] "memory vaults" [...] which can unlock a short series of slides providing extra <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> character's backstory. Most of these worlds culminate in a boss battle that fully resolves the character's emotional distress and advance the story. The player is able to revisit any of these worlds after completing them to locate any additional collectibles they may have missed. Raz is given some items early in the game, one that allows him to leave any mental world at any time, and another that can provide hints about what to do next or how to defeat certain enemies.|$|E

2500|$|The key {{characteristic}} of Early Classical figures {{is that they}} are often somewhat stockier and less dynamic than their predecessors. As a result, the depictions gained seriousness, even pathos. The folds of garments were depicted less linearly, thus appearing more plastic. The manner of presenting scenes also changed substantially. Firstly, the paintings ceased to focus on the moment of a particular event, but rather, with dramatic tension, showed the situation immediately before the action, thus implying and contextualising the event proper. Also, some of the other new achievements of Athenian democracy began to show an influence on vase painting. Thus, influences of tragedy and of wall painting can be detected. Since Greek wall painting is almost entirely lost today, its reflection on vases constitutes one of the few, albeit modest, sources of <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> genre of art. Other influences on High Classical vase painting include the newly erected Parthenon and its sculptural decoration. This is especially visible in the depiction of garments; the material now falls more naturally, and more folds are depicted, leading to an increased [...] "depth" [...] of the depiction. The overall compositions were simplified even more. Artists placed special emphasis on symmetry, harmony, and [...] The human figures had returned to their earlier slenderness; often they radiate a self-absorbed, divine serenity.|$|E
