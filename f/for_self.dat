5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage <b>for</b> <b>self</b> consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E
5|$|During {{their stay}} in mosques, these jamaats conduct a daily gasht, which {{involves}} visiting local neighbourhoods, preferably {{with the help}} of a guide. They invite people to attend the Maghrib prayer at their mosque and those who attend are delivered a sermon after the prayers, which essentially outlines the Six Principles. They urge the attendees to spend time in tabligh <b>for</b> <b>self</b> reformation and the propagation of Islam. Also the regular activities like eating, sleeping etc. are also carried out in the mosques.|$|E
5|$|The {{resisting}} Gaza Empire, {{a collection}} of indigenous tribes who inhabited the area that now constitutes Mozambique and Zimbabwe, was defeated in 1895, and the remaining inland tribes were eventually defeated by 1902; in that same year, Portugal established Lourenço Marques as the capital. In 1926, political and economic crisis in Portugal led {{to the establishment of}} the Second Republic (later to become the Estado Novo), and a revival of interest in the African colonies. Calls <b>for</b> <b>self</b> determination in Mozambique arose shortly after World War II, in light of the independence granted to many other colonies worldwide in the great wave of decolonisation.|$|E

40|$|Transition {{matrices}} <b>for</b> <b>selfing</b> and full-sib mating {{were derived}} {{to investigate the}} effect of selection against deleterious mutations {{on the process of}} inbreeding at a linked neutral locus. Selection was allowed to act within lines only (selection type I) or equally within and between lines (type II). <b>For</b> <b>selfing</b> lines under selection type I, inbreeding is always retarded, the retardation being determined by the recombination fraction between the neutral and selected loci and the inbreeding depression from the selected locus, irrespective of the selection coefficient (s) and dominance coefficient (h) of the mutant allele. <b>For</b> <b>selfing</b> under selection type II or full-sib mating under both selection types, inbreeding is delayed by weak selection (small s and sh), due to the associative overdominance created at the neutral locus, and accelerated by strong selection, due to the elevated differential contributions between alternative alleles at the neutral locus within individuals and between lines (for selection type II). For multiple fitness loci under selection, stochastic simulations were run <b>for</b> populations with <b>selfing,</b> full-sib mating, and random mating, using empirical estimates of mutation parameters and inbreeding load in Drosophila. The simulations results are in general compatible with empirical observations...|$|R

25|$|The {{settlers}} eventually freed many {{of these}} slaves.

Meanwhile, Britain passed an imperial law in 1790 that assured prospective immigrants to Canada that they could retain their slaves as property. From 1793, the trade in, but not possession of, slaves was abolished in the colony of Upper Canada. Trading was abolished across the British Empire in 1807 (particularly the Atlantic trade). The institution of slavery was abolished Empire-wide by 1834 (except in India, where it was considered an indigenous institution).|$|E
25|$|Feeling or affective {{reaction}} (vedana) {{is also at}} {{the source}} of the emotions and it is categorized in various ways; as physical or mental, as pleasant, unpleasant or neutral; and as rooted in the different senses. The Buddha also makes a distinction between worldly and unworldly or spiritual feelings, seeing spiritual feelings as superior. Out of these basic immediate reactions as well as our situational context, conceptualization and personal history arise more complex emotions, such as fear, hatred, hope or despair. The Buddhist theory of emotions also highlights the ethical and spiritual importance of positive emotions such as compassion and friendliness as antidotes for negative emotions and as vehicles <b>for</b> <b>self</b> development.|$|E
