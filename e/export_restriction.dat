At the same time, there has also been an increase in <b>restrictions</b> on the <b>export</b> of raw materials which has led policy makers and business people to address free trade of raw materials. This paper provides information on the present situation regarding the use of <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> and international disciplines on these measures. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions</b> are maintained to achieve diverse policy objectives, including environmental protection or conservation of natural resources, promotion of downstream processing industries, controlling inflationary pressures, and for fiscal receipts reasons. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions</b> take various forms such as <b>export</b> duties, quantitative <b>restrictions,</b> and licensing requirements. The number of countries applying export duties over the period 2003 - 2009 was higher than in previous years and that such duties were introduced primarily by developing and least developed countries. Under the current WTO rules, unlike quantitative <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> which are in principle prohibited, there is no substantive discipline on export duties, although there have been efforts to revise this at the multilateral and bilateral levels. The WTO accession process imposes several disciplines. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions</b> have also been discussed during the DDA negotiations in both NAMA (Non-Agricultural Market Access) and agriculture negotiations. Several regional trade agreements (RTAs) went beyond the WTO by including prohibition of <b>export</b> duties. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions,</b> by creating a differential between the price available to domestic processors and the price charged to foreign processors, provide domestic processing industries with an advantage. Although several governments apply <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> to achieve diverse policy objectives, not all rely on such restrictions.

This paper {{examines}} one such barrier, <b>export</b> <b>restrictions,</b> and how it impacts trade and global supply in selected strategic metals and minerals. The metals and minerals examined in the paper are of particular interest for a number of reasons: they are generally geographically concentrated in a few countries, many are used in the production of high-technology goods in strategic sectors and there are few substitutes for these raw materials given the present state of technology. For all these reasons, importing countries are dependent on a reliable supply of these raw materials. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions</b> may be applied for a number of reasons: protection of the environment, preservation of natural resources, protection of downstream industries, or as a response to a number of different market imperfections. This paper examines the motivations for using <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> and finds varying impacts on trade and global supply. In one case, the <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> put into place did not fulfill their objective of environmental protection.

40|$|In {{recent years}} Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan (RUK) became {{major players in}} the {{international}} trade of agricultural products. Especially with regard to grain, the increase of RUK exports certainly helped to improve global food security. However, in 2010 the RUK countries introduced <b>export</b> <b>restriction</b> measures on grains further to major harvest failures due to severe droughts. Due to the importance of the RUK countries for world grain markets, the export restrictions had adverse effects on international food security by adding to instable world grain markets and contributing to spikes in international food prices; however it is not clear to which extent. By replicating the harvest situation of 2010 in RUK, this paper provides a model-based quantitative assessment of the impact of different grain <b>export</b> <b>restriction</b> measures (bans, tariffs, quotas) in RUK on food security by quantifying their impact on world and domestic grains market quantities and prices. For the quantitative analysis AGLINK-COSIMO, a recursive-dynamic, partial equilibrium, supply-demand model, has been applied. Scenario results indicate that if the RUK countries apply ad hoc export restrictions as a response of lower domestic grain availability, the resulting effects on international and domestic grains markets depend on both the specific <b>export</b> <b>restriction</b> measure and the country profile. Results show that especially for a country like Ukraine, i. e. a country usually exporting large shares of its grains production, the introduction of ad hoc export bans or very restrictive export quotas do not only over privilege domestic consumers but have also severe negative effects on the international grains markets by contributing significantly to price increases and thus have adverse effects on global food security.

First, SSL protocol brings considerable burden to the CPU utilization so that performance and speed of the security service is lowered during encryption transaction. Sec-ond, SSL protocol can be vulnerable for cryptanalysis due to the fixed algo-rithm being used. Third, it causes a problem of mutual interaction with other protocols because of the encryption <b>export</b> <b>restriction</b> policy of the U. S. Fourth, it is difficult for developers to learn and use cryptography API for SSL. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose an SSL component based on CBD. The execution of the SSL component is supported by Confidentiality and Integrity component. It can encrypt data selectively and use various mecha-nisms such as SEED and HAS- 160. Also, it can complement the SSL protocols problems and, at the same time, take advantage of component. Finally, in the performance analysis, we present a better result than the SSL protocol as the data size is increased. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} issue of this journal, Bouët (2001) offers a {{contribution}} to the literature dealing with the implication of quantitative restrictions in international oligopolies. The main result of the paper is that When the R-D investment has uncertain consequences on marginal cost, a voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restriction</b> (VER) decreases innovation by the domestic producer as compared to the free trade level. This result holds both under Cournot and Bertrand competition (p. 323). The aim of the present note is to show that, contrary to the author's claim, the qualitative impact of the VER on R-D investment does depend on the mode of market competition in his model. In order to show this, we provide a counter-example that makes use of the linear example developed by Bouët (2001) and solve it for Bertrand competition (instead of Cournot). In this case, a VER increases R-D expenses (instead of decreasing it under Cournot), i. e. depending on the mode of competition, the implication of the VER on the R-D investment are reversed...|$|E

Within the framework of a Markov-switching error correction model, we utilize weekly wheat grower prices of Serbia and world market prices and compare the state of the wheat market prevailing in the time period before the crisis to when the exports controls are effective. Our results suggest that although the degree of market integration and thus the long-run price elasticity do not change during the crisis, the market equilibrium was disrupted and the stability was reduced during the crisis. Also, we find that the price dampening effect of the export restrictions prevailed only in a short time period and that the Serbian wheat grower prices even increased beyond the world market afterwards. wheat market, international market integration, price transmission, Markov-switching vector error correction model, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

This creates a complementarity between the price of food in international markets and export policy. Speci 8 ̆ 5 cally, unilateral actions by exporting countries {{give rise to a}} "multiplier e¤ect": when a shock in the international food market drives up (down) its price, governments respond by imposing export restrictions (subsidies), thus exacerbating the initial shock and soliciting further export activism.

40|$|In {{light of}} the growing {{international}} competition among states and globally operating companies for limited natural resources, <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> on raw materials have become a popular means for governments to strive for various goals, including industrial development, natural resource conservation and environmental protection. For instance, China as a major supplier of many raw materials has been using its powerful position to both economic and political ends. The European Union (EU), alongside economic heavyweights such as the US, Japan and Mexico, launched two high-profile cases against such <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> by China at the WTO in 2009 and 2012.

This argumentation is based on the analysis of pertinent factors such as the economic impact, the ambiguity of WTO law on <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> and the pressure by individual member states on the EU as well as the role of joint complaints at the WTO and political considerations influencing the EU’s decision-making process...|$|R
