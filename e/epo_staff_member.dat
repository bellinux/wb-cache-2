5000|$|Under Battistelli's tenure, the EPO {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the preparatory work for the introduction of the unitary patent, which has yet to come into existence. In this context, Battistelli was listed in 2014 by the Managing Intellectual Property magazine as one of the 50 most influential people in intellectual property. In June 2014, Battistelli's term of office as EPO president was extended for a further three years until 30 June 2018, amidst concerns from the EPO staff. Battistelli's presidency of the EPO has encountered discontent among the staff and has been marked by industrial actions with an escalation of the conflict in 2014. Discontent on the part of staff has been attributed to Battistelli's style of management which, according to reports in the German newspapers Die Zeit and Die Welt, is perceived by staff as being unduly autocratic and unsuited to a European intergovernmental body such as the EPO, and, according to an article in the French newspaper Le Monde, has been brought in relation with suicides among the EPO staff since 2013. Battistelli's management style has also been criticized in the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, and by Philip Cordery, member of the French National Assembly. In an interview to the German business lawyer journal JUVE, Siegfried Bross, former judge at the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, expressed the view that EPO's organization giving its president excessive powers is [...] "principally incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)" [...] and that EPO's president, Benoît Batistelli, acted in 2015 against an <b>EPO</b> <b>staff</b> <b>member</b> [...] "without legal legitimacy".|$|E
5000|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} regarding {{the high number}} of suicides of EPO employees, five in over three years. The EPO President Battistelli dismissed the suggestions -by <b>EPO</b> <b>staff</b> union SUEPO- of a possible link between the suicide and working conditions at the EPO as [...] "totally inappropriate" [...] and accused the staff union of [...] "abusing a personal tragedy and inciting controversy". The <b>EPO</b> <b>staff</b> union SUEPO said that a direct link between the suicide and the working conditions had not been demonstrated but that the Dutch Labour Inspectorate should be given the opportunity of investigating the matter.|$|R

40|$|Oncology care is {{considered}} a stressful occupation. Little {{is known about the}} coping strategies oncology <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> use to deal with the stress of their work. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether a self-protective strategy found in parents of children with cancer is also present in pediatric oncology staff. To explore this assumption, staff members' ratings were compared with the parents' ratings on the need for support and with the children's ratings on experienced pain. We also explored the characteristics which <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> attribute to the children and the parents. A total of 76 <b>staff</b> <b>members,</b> 84 children with cancer, and their 163 parents participated in the study. Both gender and number of years working in oncology care were positively associated with increased self-protective reactions in <b>staff</b> <b>members.</b> Male <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> rated medical procedures and the pain children experience in general as less painful than did female <b>staff</b> <b>members.</b> Their judgements about experienced pain in general and the lumbar puncture procedure in particular tended to be lower than the children's ratings. Female <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> attributed more positive characteristics to children with cancer and their parents than did male <b>staff</b> <b>members.</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>members</b> with more years of experience in oncology tended to rate all three medical procedures as less painful than those with less years of experience, and they also attributed more positive characteristics to the children. <b>Staff</b> <b>members</b> should be observant to their perceptions of children and parents, especially if their experience increase...|$|R

40|$|There {{continues}} to be a gap between the growing multicultural student body and predominantly White faculty and <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> who work with students.

Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and were coded and then categorized into overarching themes that emerged from the data.
