5|$|John Cena and Chris Jericho were {{involved}} in the main rivalry on the Raw brand over the World Heavyweight Championship. At WWE's November Survivor Series, Cena returned to the WWE after a legitimate neck injury (that he sustained at SummerSlam) and defeated Jericho to win the championship. On the November 24 episode of Raw, Jericho defeated Randy Orton and Batista in a Triple Threat match to earn a title match against Cena at Armageddon. Later that night, Chris Jericho attempted to steal Cena's thunder, claiming that he plans on winning back the title at Armageddon. When World Champion, John Cena could even make his much anticipated return to Raw, he then gave Jericho an opportunity to confront him face-to-face, Cena explained the difference between himself and Jericho, stating that he actually cares about the many members of the WWE Universe. After Jericho once again stated his intention to beat Cena at Armageddon and continued to belittle the WWE Universe, Cena snapped. He proceeded to brutalize Jericho, throwing him against the announce table, bludgeoning him with the steel stairs and locking him into an STFU. On the following week's episode of Raw, Jericho made his presence known {{in much the same way}} as Cena did the week before, addressing the audience as he made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> down to the ring. The difference however, was that while Cena welcomed his fans, Jericho made pains to ignore them. He then went on to explain his resentment toward Cena, stating that while away from the WWE since August 2005, Jericho's son grew to be a fan, not of his father, but of John Cena. Now, Jericho hopes to show his son and all of the WWE what a real hero is, by beating Cena for the World Heavyweight Title at Armageddon. Later that night, Cena fought Kane in Raw's main event. Though Jericho attempted to become involved, Cena managed to fight off and then go on to defeat Kane. After the match, Cena chased Jericho, who was attempting to escape. The tables turned, however, when Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Manu emerged to attack Cena, allowing Jericho to lock Cena in the Walls of Jericho.|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{addressed}} {{the people and}} asked Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, the other consul, if he disapproved of the law. Calpurnius Bibulus just {{said that he would}} not tolerate any innovations during his year of office. Caesar did not ask any questions to other officials. Instead he brought forward the two most influential men in Rome, Pompey and Crassus, who were private citizens. They both declared their support for the law. Caesar asked Pompey if he would help him against the opponents of the law. Pompey said that he would and Crassus seconded him. Bibulus, supported by three plebeian tribunes, obstructed the vote. When he ran out of excuses for delaying he declared a sacred period for all the remaining days of the year. This meant that the people could not legally even meet in their assembly. Caesar ignored him and set date for the vote. The senate met at the house of Calpurnius Bibulus because it had not been convened. It planned that Bibulus was to oppose the law so that it would look that the senate was overcome by force, rather than through inaction. On the day of the vote Bibulus forced <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> with his followers to the temple of Castor where Caesar was making his speech. When he tried to make a speech he and his followers were pushed down the steps. There was a scuffle and some of the tribunes were wounded. Bibulus defied some men who had daggers, but he was dragged away by his friends. Cato pushed through the crowd and tried to make a speech, but was lifted up and carried away by Caesar’s supporters. He made a second attempt, but nobody listened to him.|$|E

500|$|According to Bruce, {{the goal}} was to produce an album that was [...] "very {{much a part of the}} Dark Carnival, without it being the seventh Joker's Card". Bang! Pow! Boom! was the first album to focus on this concept since Hell's Pit. The album was later {{revealed}} to be the first Joker's Card of a [...] "second deck." [...] Bang! Pow! Boom! is a character within the Dark Carnival which Bruce describes as a [...] "continuous explosion that stomps <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> blowing [...] evil souls [...] to Hell". The album features a series of skits in which rednecks, pedophiles, and husbands who abuse their wives receive phone calls inviting them to the Dark Carnival, where they are promised US$100,000 for arriving.|$|E
500|$|Hooper has cited {{changes in}} the {{cultural}} and political landscape as central influences on the film. His intentional misinformation, that the [...] "film {{you are about to}} see is true", was a response to being [...] "lied to by the government about things that were going on all over the world", including Watergate, the 1973 oil crisis, and [...] "the massacres and atrocities in the Vietnam War". The [...] "lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things" [...] that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by [...] "showing brains spilled all over the road", led to his belief that [...] "man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, so I put a literal mask on the monster in my film". The idea of using a chainsaw as the murder weapon came to Hooper {{while he was in the}} hardware section of a busy store, contemplating how to speed <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b>|$|E
500|$|In New York City, Carl {{presents}} [...] "Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World" [...] on Broadway, starring Baxter and an imprisoned Kong. Ann {{is played}} by an anonymous chorus girl, and Kong becomes enraged after realizing that the girl on stage is not Ann. After breaking free from his chrome-steel chains, he wrecks the theater and chases Jack. Kong knocks Jack out by stopping his car and flipping it, then encounters Ann again. Kong and Ann share a moment on a frozen pond in Central Park until the army attacks. Kong climbs with Ann onto {{the top of the}} Empire State Building, where he fights off six F8C-5 Helldiver Navy planes, downing three. At the end of the confrontation, Kong is mortally wounded by the gunfire and gazes at Ann for the last time before falling from the building to his death. As Ann is reunited with Jack, civilians, photographers, police and soldiers gather around Kong's corpse. Carl makes <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> takes one last long look at Kong and says, [...] "It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the advent}} of Insane Clown Posse's Second Deck (2009), the {{character}} Bang! Pow! Boom!, a new spirit in the Dark Carnival, was introduced. The character is a demon-like figure that Bruce describes as a [...] "continuous explosion that stomps <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> blowing [...] evil souls [...] to Hell". Though the group originally intended to make the character separate from the Six Joker's Cards, he was revealed {{as part of the}} second set of Joker's Cards.|$|E
2500|$|In the New York Daily News, Burns Mantle {{declared}} that [...] "Oklahoma! really is different – beautifully different. With {{the songs that}} Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, Oklahoma! {{seems to me to}} be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since Edna Ferber's Show Boat". New York World-Telegram critic Burton Rascoe particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that [...] "Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet , is actually the biggest hit of the show. The [...] "Out of My Dreams" [...] and [...] "All Er Nuthin'" [...] dances are such supreme aesthetic delights.... They are spinetingling, out of this world." [...] In The New York Sun, Ward Morehouse commented that [...] "Oklahoma! is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical," [...] as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. [...] "It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B." [...] Lorenz Hart himself [...] "pushed <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> at the after-show party in Sardi's restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life." ...|$|E
