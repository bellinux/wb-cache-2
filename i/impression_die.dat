50|$|It is {{also known}} as <b>impression</b> <b>die</b> forging. Impressions are made in a pair of dies. These {{impressions}} are transferred to the work piece during deformation. A small gap between the dies called flash gutter is provided so that the excess metal can flow into the gutter and form a flash. Flash has got a very important role during deformation of the work piece inside the die cavity. Due to high length to thickness ratio of the flash gutter, friction in the gap is very high. Due to this the material in the flash gap is subjected to high pressure. There is high resistance to flow. This in turn promotes effective filling of the die cavity. In hot forging, the flash cools faster as a result of it being smaller in size. This enhances the resistance of the flash material to deformation resistance. As a result of this, the bulk of work piece is forced to deform and fill the die cavity more effectively - even intricate parts of the die cavity is filled.|$|E
40|$|FORGING is {{a process}} by which a billet of simple cross section is plastically {{deformed}} by applying compressive forces through dies or tools to obtain a more complex shape. In <b>impression</b> <b>die</b> forging, two or more dies are moved toward each other to form a metal billet that is heated to the appropriate forging temperature. This process is capable of producing components of high qual-ity at moderate cost. It offers a high strength-to-weight ratio, toughness, and resistance to impact and fatigue. Forged components find application in the automobile/automotive industry and in air-craft, railroad, and mining equipment. Some parts can be forged in a single set of dies, while others, due to shape complexity an...|$|E

40|$|Intermediate forming {{aimed at}} distributing the {{material}} volume contributes to better {{utilization of the}} material, {{reducing the amount of}} energy required for heating and improving quality by using near-net-shape geometries. A range of different forming operations exists for realizing material distribution. This paper gives an overview of the process technologies used for distributing the material in an intermediate forming stage in forging of light metals such as aluminum, titanium and titan-aluminide, and also illustrates their application areas. The technique of cross wedge rolling is an incremental forming process with open groove and partial force exposure. The wedge shape for forming is generated by using wedge-shaped tools or due to controlled axial feed of simple round tools. Research and technology development in the field of bulk metal forming at the Fraunhofer Institute IWU Chemnitz has resulted in a number of successful applications of cross wedge rolling in preforming. The development of a single cross wedge rolling operation will save other forming operations in the production of titanium aircraft components. A considerable reduction in cycle times and in manufacturing costs {{is the result of the}} shortened process chain. Additionally, the number of ancillary processes, such as heating, adjustment and lubricant application are reduced as well. Another application of cross wedge rolling resulted in enhanced preforming for subsequent flash-poor forging of aluminum powertrain components. The challenges of controlling the material structure and tight temperature requirements were met by a flow-optimized work-piece design in combination with a heated rolling tool. There is evidence demonstrating the bulk metal forming of gamma-titan-aluminide by cross wedge rolling followed by <b>impression</b> <b>die</b> forging using the same heat...|$|E

This technique utilizes a clear poly vinyl siloxane bite registration material to take a small impression without a tray and uses that <b>impression</b> as a <b>die</b> to force the unset light cured dental restorative material into the original anatomy, surface texture and occlusion that the patient had when the procedure started. Then the restorative material is cured through the clear bite registration material creating a hard smooth surface without an air inhibited, layer reducing or eliminating any finishing or polishing, and saving 5 to 10 minutes of chairtime. If the original surface is defective that defect is easily filled in with red border molding wax prior to taking the impression with a clear bite registration material. The lecture utilizes the following cases to teach the technique: Porcelain Veneer Temporization, # 9 Cervical Abrasion, # 3 Mesial-Occlusal, # 19 Mesial-Occlusal,# 13 Mesial-Occlusal, # 22 Rest for Partial Denture, # 6 Large Class 3, Available Products, # 18 Occlusal, # 10 Class 5 (Penetrating Stain), # 9 Class 5 (Gross Caries), # 17 and 18 Occlusal, # 4 Distal-Occlusal (Sectional Matrix), # 12 Distal-Occlusal, # 10 Peg Lateral,and # 30 Occlusal (Marginal Breakdown).

The Toho dub (named Super Spacefortress Macross in Japan) had been created for international sales by a Hong Kong dubbing facility. The better known of the two US releases of the dub is an edited version that was released by Celebrity Home Entertainment's [...] "Just for Kids" [...] label in the late 1980s, renamed Clash of the Bionoids. It has been heavily criticized by fans of the film for extreme cuts [...] - [...] nearly thirty minutes were excised from the movie.

40|$|Statement of the Problem: Understanding about {{impression}} materials, their properties, {{uses and}} manipulation can guide operators towards having more successful restorations. Purpose: The {{aim of this}} in vitro study was to compare the accuracy of a condensation silicone impression material, Optosil, and an addition poly siloxane impression material, Elite-HD. Materials and Method: A laboratory model with two metallic dies was used to make impression. A horizontal notch {{on one of the}} two dies simulated an undercut. Ten impressions were made by each impression material by the putty-wash technique. After pouring <b>impressions</b> with velmix <b>die</b> stone, a total of 20 stone casts were made from both materials. Measurements of casts were compared with the master model. Statistical analyses were performed using t-test. Result: This results of this study showed that the height of die without undercut decreased in both groups. Also the height above the undercut decreased in both groups, which was more obvious in Elite-HD group than Optosil group. The distance between dies increased in both groups, with higher figures for Elite-HD. So, Optosil is a more accurate material for registering inter-abutment distance than Elite-HD. The diameter of die under the undercut decreased in Optosil group and was similar to the master model in Elite-HD. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between these two groups in the distance between abutments (p= 0. 001), the diameter of die under the undercut (p= 0. 014) and the height of  die above undercut(p= 0. 057). Conclusion: Optosil is more accurate in registering inter-abutment distance than Elite-HD, so Optosil is preferred for fixed partial denture impressions. Since Elite-HD showed more accuracy in C measurements than Optosil, it is preferred for single crown impressions...|$|R
40|$|Background: All {{people have}} {{different}} postures while sleeping. Most people will prefer a lateral position. In {{the last days}} and hours before dying, patients are usually {{to be found in}} a supine position. In literature so far it has never been questioned whether the supine position is the most comfortable posture for every dying person and its possible consequences for the quality of dying. Aim: To explore or hospice patients wish to be helped in their natural body posture of preference (NBPP) and whether NBPP contributes to an improvement of quality of dying. Methods: In an explorative observational study, patients with immanent risk of dying were questioned about their favorite position during sleep. Besides they were asked whether they would like to be helped in this position in the last hours of life. After a confirmative answer, patients were assured to be nursed in their favorite posture during their final hours. To evaluate the maintenance of this promise, photographs were taken to capture the wanted position directly following the interview and directly after dying. Findings: 14 out of 22 patients died in their NBPP; 1 person died acutely, 5 patients returned home and 2 patients were still alive at the end of inclusion. All relatives reported that seeing their beloved one dying in a familiar and comfortable posture provided support and comfort. The natural position diminished their relative’s <b>impression</b> of suffering <b>dying.</b> Nurses were positive toward helping patients in their NBPP. Conclusions: This first explorative intervention study about NBPP provides a visualization of concrete wishes and supports the assumption that hospice patients have a need and opportunity for their unique need to be known until the moment of death. Relatives and professionals are positive about this careful personalized intervention to improve comfort in the last hours of the dying patient...|$|R
40|$|Multilayer Flood-welding {{repair of}} hot forging dies {{is a very}} useful {{technique}} which can remarkably enhance the working life of the die. Conventional quenched and tempered dies do not exhibit good resistance to wear. Therefore, these dies are nitrided to improve wear resistance but after the production of few numbers of forgings cracks are produced. Thatâ€™s why here multilayer flood-welding technique has been adapted to improve the die life and to establish the optimum parameters for this technique. In the current work, the modified H 12 hot-work tool steel was weld deposited in the cavity of hot-forging dies and their performance was monitored visually for the die condition and with the macroscopic and microscopic examination. It was analyzed that the thicknesses of the both hard upper â€˜capping layerâ€™ and intermediate â€˜buffer layerâ€™ have a prominent influence on the performance and the life hot forging die. For a particular dimensions and contour of the <b>die</b> <b>impression,</b> there came out an optimal thickness of the capping layer that provided the best performance. Further increase in capping layers thickness exhibited brittle cracking, whereas thinner capping layers produced early wear and plastic deformation. For intermediate buffer layer, {{in order to provide}} adequate backup support to capping layer, a certain minimum thickness level is required. This process minimized the die steel consumption because the thickness of the forging die is not reduced in the process of reworking and ultimately the process is cost effective. Moreover, the Multilayered flood-welded dies were gas nitrided to further enhance the life of the forging die. The results have shown that double stage nitriding process is good for these dies which produced minimum compound layer on the nitrided surface. The die life as a result of nitriding was amazingly increased compared to normal Multilayered flood-welded dies. The dies showed very slow wear and thermal fatigue cracking after the production of large number of forgings. By employing these dies excellent overall surface finish of the forged parts was achieved...|$|R
