The need for multilingual support is increasing every day making virtual worlds a very good example of fields of development where applications supporting multilinguality are becoming an absolute necessity. In order to enhance interoperability between virtual worlds, applications and corpora, it is obvious that standards should come into place. This is the main goal of MLIF and, on a more global perspective, of the Metaverse 1 project. In this paper, we study social interactions in virtual worlds, present some cues to facilitate them, and describe the empirical support that we developed for these theories.

40|$|<b>Language</b> <b>learning</b> {{motivation}} {{is likely to}} be influenced by important individuals surrounding learners, such as their parents (Williams & Burden, 1997). Whereas the potential role of parents in motivating their offspring was identified early on by Gardner and Lambert (1972), there have been relatively few in-depth studies that focus on the role of parents in fostering their children motivation (Bartram, 2006; Kyriacou & Zhu, 2008), even though Bartram (2006) findings suggest that parental attitudes are not only language- but also context-specific. This mixed-methods study investigates the role of parents in <b>fostering</b> <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> motivation of Polish language learners of English. 599 fifteen-year old students attending state schools completed a motivational questionnaire, in which they were asked to report their mothers’ and fathers’ level of education and level of English, and 20 learners participated in semi-structured interviews. MANOVA analyses of the questionnaire data revealed significant differences between students whose mothers and fathers had differing levels of education affecting scores on self-efficacy beliefs, English self-concept, ideal L 2 self, instrumental orientation and self-regulation. The scores tended to increase with the level of mothers’ and fathers’ education. Similarly, there were significant differences on six motivational scales (self-efficacy beliefs, English self-concept, ideal L 2 self, instrumental orientation, intrinsic motivation and self-regulation), when students were divided according to their mothers’ and fathers’ level of English. The scores increased in line with the level of parents’ English as reported by students. Further, the interview data revealed a number of ways, in which parents’ <b>fostered</b> their offspring’s <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> motivation, such as communicating positive attitudes towards studying English; parental encouragement to study English in the form of verbal comments and, to a lesser extent, rewards; actively helping children with their English studies; and stimulating the development of intrinsic motivation by creating positive <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> experiences...|$|R

The United States does not have a coherent, unified national policy on immigrant integration or language access whereas many European countries have explicit goals and funds dedicated to cultural, social and language integration and assimilation. As Michael Fix from the Migration Policy Institute in Washington put it, ?there are widely diversified responses to immigration across the US.

40|$|The European Language Portfolio (ELP) was {{designed}} as a tool that “supports reflective learning and fosters the development of learner autonomy” (Little 2009); it thus supports students in exploring, creating and documenting their own learning paths. This article will investigate an action-oriented approach to learning and teaching in an undergraduate language degree course at the University of Padova, Italy, based on the pedagogical principles of the ELP (Council of Europe 2011). Students who enrol on this degree course arrive with varying degrees of language ability and diverse <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> backgrounds; and due to the disparate nature of their proficiency levels, <b>fostering</b> <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> awareness is crucial. Task-based activities are fundamental to this approach, enabling students to explore and develop their communicative language competences through authentic target language use, and to reflect on their progress through guided self- and peer assessment. In the article, we will showcase examples of tasks which demonstrate the approach adopted. We will first explore how peer assessment of student audio recordings was used in a course where first-year students were aiming to develop their spoken production skills. We will then illustrate how second-year students engaged in self-assessment of their skills in activities designed to explore the language of interaction and production. Finally, we will focus {{on the use of the}} ELP Dossier as a pedagogical tool, with students compiling an “academic” Dossier and reflecting on the choices of work to include in it...|$|R
40|$|With English as an undisputed global lingua franca, {{there is}} long-standing concern in anglophone {{countries}} over {{the lack of}} interest in language learning. In the UK, significant changes in language education policy, a mentality of insularity and the global spread of English have all contributed to a drop in language learning uptake beyond the compulsory stage. While the UK has seen many initiatives aiming to <b>foster</b> <b>language</b> <b>learning,</b> no interventions so far have aimed to change learner attitudes by raising students' language awareness of (a) the spread of English globally, and (b) cognitive benefits of mulitilingualism, and the ubiquity of multilingualism, globally and in the UK. A teaching intervention designed for this purpose was delivered to 97 students aged 12 - 13 in three different state schools in England and Scotland. The effect of the intervention was measured by a pre- and post-questionnaire, with questions closely tailored to the content of the intervention. In addition, qualitative student feedback was gathered after the intervention. Results show significant changes, across the cohort, in two out of three constructs studied, and effects on students' attitude towards language learning. Thus, we conclude that raising anglophone students' awareness of language through raising awareness of cognitive benefits of multilingualism, and the spread of English globally, has the potential to change the attitudes of learners otherwise not interested in language learning...|$|E
40|$|Master of EducationThis {{research}} project came about {{in response to}} two innovations introduced to the language-learning curriculum for the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE), the curriculum for the final two years of secondary schooling in Victoria. These innovations, which gave the teacher more control over oral assessment and introduced a vocationally oriented focus to the generalist curriculum, appeared to offer positive change to the curriculum. Yet a more detailed investigation into {{the structure of the}} curriculum led to a concern that it had the potential to set back rather than advance language learning. Central to this concern {{was the fact that the}} curriculum design seeks to <b>foster</b> <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> for interpersonal communication in an assessment model that is grounded in an outcomes- and competency-based framework, thus bringing together the ambiguity inherent in intercultural communication and the clarity demanded by a curriculum that focuses on behavioural outcomes. A need was identified for language-specific research to investigate the role of intercultural knowledge in communication and to propose a way for this knowledge to be incorporated into the curriculum framework. This {{research project}} took up this challenge with a focus on the Indonesian language. A topic was chosen from the curriculum as the basis for collecting authentic data in Indonesian settings. The topic was 'finding accommodation' and data collection focussed on finding accommodation in a kos, a type of room rental common for single people in Indonesia. Data were collected from research sites in two Indonesian towns over a period of six months in 2001. Four methods of data collection were used: ethnographic interviews, participant observation, comment banks and role-plays. Cultural themes in the data were identified through domain analysis and noticing, and themes identified in one source of data were verified in other sources. One source of data, the kos interview role-plays, was analysed using discourse analysis to help patterns emerge and thus develop a model for a generic text-type for teaching. This research project found that cultural knowledge and values are expressed in the course of communication in a kos interview that are different to what the learner might expect if approaching this text-type from a position grounded in Australian culture; that different norms to Australian norms can be identified and a workable pattern of these norms extracted from the data and incorporated into a framework for meeting the requirements of the VCE curriculum. The model for incorporating intercultural communication into the VCE curriculum proposed in this research project serves as a starting point for further research into the intercultural dimensions of Indonesian interaction in different settings with the aim of enhancing the resources available to teachers of Indonesian in Australia.

Despite {{the many}} changes {{socially}} and politically in our country, {{particularly in the}} educational sphere, large numbers of learners in further education still face disadvantages like a legacy of inferior education and studying in a language other that their primary language, all of which impact on their learning. Recent literature on the experiences of Adult Basic Education and Training (ABET) learner’s experiences of <b>learning</b> in <b>language</b> other than their primary language identifies {{a number of problems}} that impact negatively on students’ performance and learning. The research explores the experiences of ABET learners, <b>learning</b> in a <b>language</b> other than their primary language in order to interprete and arrive at an informed understanding of such experiences. The research strategy in this study is grounded within the interpretative paradigm as the aim is to understand how participants make sense of their realities. i. e. how students make sense of their experiences from their own perspectives. For the purposes of the study, a sample of ABET learners were interviewed. Purposive sampling was used to select participants from diverse languages to serve as “information-rich cases”. Semi- structured interviews aimed at encouraging the respondent’ to engage in conversation intended to elicit respondents’ construction were conducted. The data were analysed using the constant comperative method of data analysis. The main findings of the research is that the ABET learners experience problems when taught in a language which is not their primary language. They feared that they ran a greater risk of labelled as underachievers. They also cited that they have difficulty in manipulating the language in an academic situation. The choice of teacher pedagogy and pace of teaching which exaccebates difficulty in using English was also mentioned by the learners. Another challenge was that they find it easy to use the language in informal context, but struggle with the level of sophistication required for an academic level. There is a need for closer links to be made between learners’ life experiences and lesson content and structure. The curriculum must address the real experiences that adult learners bring with them into the classroom and offer to learners the conceptual tools which they need to make sense of and interprete their experiences in the society. Awareness of students’ experiences could enable educators to exceed guidelines for creating an environment which <b>fosters</b> <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> and to choose relevant course materials and select appropriate teaching methods as well as introduce measures to redress the impact of the legacy of inferior schooling in order to enhance quality learning.

40|$|This {{portfolio}} is {{the culmination of}} two years of study in the Master of Second Language Teaching and represents not only the development of the author’s teaching philosophy but also her professional development as a teacher over that course of time. The teaching philosophy is built on the three pillars of 1) use of the target language, 2) copious use of authentic materials, and 3) teaching the use of the mechanics, or rules of the language. Although understanding of the rules facilitates second <b>language</b> <b>learning,</b> they cannot be <b>learned</b> without using <b>language</b> and language will not really be understood without understanding the attendant culture(s) —which is what makes the use of authentic materials so valuable. Included in support of the author’s teaching philosophy and professional development are three artifacts. The author showcases her research in Dual Language Immersion: Truly Bilingual, Biliterate, and Bicultural Education and what’s in it for US. In the artifact Zwischen Ehrenmord und Familiendrama: Is the call for Integration in Germany one for Transculturation or Cultural Selbstmord?, the author illustrates how the various voices within a culture interact in ways that are constantly remaking the living culture, and how these authentic voices can be used to create a dialogue about not only the evolution of the cultures tied to living languages, but also how they view each other. Finally the author describes what she has learned from the literature and experience about what a teacher can do to <b>foster</b> a <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> environment in Where to Go from Here.

However, parents had differing opinions regarding whether maintaining their children 2 ̆ 7 s home language was related to maintaining their home culture and the benefit to their children 2 ̆ 7 s future careers. Parents reported experiences and strategies used in supporting their children 2 ̆ 7 s home language development. Future research and implications for supporting families were also suggested...|$|R

Our experimental multiliteracies research {{project is a}} collaboration of school and university teachers and researchers following a guided action research paradigm. The study has {{as one of its}} stated objectives the development of multilingual story retelling as a means of inexpensively supporting home <b>language</b> maintenance, <b>fostering</b> <b>language</b> awareness and aiding English as a second <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> in a community of high linguistic diversity. This paper tells our story thus far, focusing on how we have approached the creation of multilingual stories in heterogeneous, urban language classes, discussing stumbling blocks that have forced creative problem-solving and showcasing successes...|$|R
40|$|Literature {{represents}} a unique source of input in English <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> {{and has been}} exploited {{using a variety of}} models and methodologies over the years. While individual sustained reading has long been recognised to support L 2 learning, recent trends have suggested extensive reading be placed within a framework, which integrates response to the text and interaction with peers, to combine reading with debate, discussion, interpretation and reflection. This study {{represents a}} close examination, analysis and evaluation of Literature Circles, which reflect such a model, based on a case study conducted in a private language centre in Vietnam. This investigation aims to seek evidence that opportunities for <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> emerge from within the co-construction of communication fostered by the interaction in learnerled, reader response groups, and are developed through collaboration, interpretation and negotiation of meaning. Classroom recordings of such interaction were analysed, and findings discussed which reflect the belief, based on sociocultural theory, that processes leading to opportunities for language acquisition can be identified as an emergent phenomenon, coconstructed within and interrelated to the support of peers within a social environment. Additional qualitative evidence in the form of learner selfevaluation questionnaires, where performance and experience in LCs were reflected upon, suggests that perceptions of self-efficacy were improved through learner participation, leading to increased motivation and learner autonomy. Literature Circles, creating opportunities for collaborative learning at the interface of <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> and literature, are argued to offer a relevant, pedagogically sound approach to <b>fostering</b> <b>language</b> acquisition in ELT...|$|R
40|$|The Internet has the {{potential}} to provide language learners with vast resources of authentic written, audio, and video materials to supplement lessons. Educators can find a wide assortment of materials for learners to study in class or after class for independent learning and to encourage learner autonomy. More recently, however, the immense popularity of social networking websites has created new opportunities for language learners to interact in authentic ways that were previously difficult to achieve. Advances in technology mean that today, learners of a language can easily interact with their peers in meaningful practice that helps <b>foster</b> <b>language</b> acquisition and motivation. That is, tasks that make use of Web 2. 0 interactivity can significantly raise students’ potential to generate meaningful output and stimulate their interest in <b>language</b> <b>learning...</b>|$|R
