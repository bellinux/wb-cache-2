40|$|Recently, Radon {{transformation}} {{has been}} used to generate barcodes for tagging medical images. The under-sampled image is projected in certain directions, and each projection is binarized using a local threshold. The concatenation of the thresholded projections creates a barcode {{that can be used for}} tagging or annotating medical images. A small number of <b>equidistant</b> <b>projections,</b> e. g., 4 or 8, is generally used to generate short barcodes. However, due to the diverse nature of digital images, and since we are only working with a small number of projections (to keep the barcode short), taking <b>equidistant</b> <b>projections</b> may not be the best course of action. In this paper, we proposed to find n optimal projections, whereas n< 180, in order to increase the expressiveness of Radon barcodes. We show examples for the exhaustive search for the simple case when we attempt to find 4 best projections out of 16 <b>equidistant</b> <b>projections</b> and compare it with the evolutionary approach in order to establish the benefit of the latter when operating on a small population size as in the case of micro-DE. We randomly selected 10 different classes from IRMA dataset (14, 400 x-ray images in 58 classes) and further randomly selected 5 images per class for our tests.

25|$|Also in the 9th century, the Persian {{mathematician}} and geographer, Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi, employed {{spherical trigonometry}} and map projection methods {{in order to}} convert polar coordinates to a different coordinate system centred on a specific point on the sphere, in this the Qibla, the direction to Mecca. Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī (973–1048) later developed ideas which are seen as an anticipation of the polar coordinate system. Around 1025, he describes a polar equi-azimuthal <b>equidistant</b> <b>projection</b> of the celestial sphere.

Contemporary stellate plans of the Bhumija shrines in central India from where the inspiration for this temple came from, were all 32-pointed interrupted types. No temples of the 6-, 12-, or 24-pointed stellate plans are known to exist in Karnataka or Maharashtra, {{with the exception of the}} Doddabasappa temple, which can be described as a 24-pointed uninterrupted plan. In an 'interrupted' stellate plan, the stellate outline is interrupted by orthogonal (right-angle) projections in the cardinal directions, resulting in star points that have been skipped.The Doddabasappa temple marks the mature development of the Chalukyan art which originated from basic dravida architecture of South India. Its departure from conventional dravida plan used in the Virupaksha temple in Pattadakal is so extreme that it would be very difficult to find similarities without detailed examination. A star shape is obtained by rotating a square about its centre. The star points form <b>equidistant</b> <b>projections.</b> The angles and re-entrant angles thus formed make the perimeter of the outerwall of the shrine.|$|R

With an unquantized receiver, coding based on algebraic rotations is known to achieve modulation coding diversity.

Through analysis, we propose specific rotations which result in the codewords having <b>equidistant</b> component-wise <b>projections.</b> We show that the proposed coding scheme achieves maximum modulation diversity with a low-complexity minimum distance decoder.

40|$|This paper uses a 3 D - GIS {{environment}} for simulating a spatial representation of urban canyons {{in place of}} many other high cost -equipment methods for determining Sky View Factors (SVF), allowing also the visualization of urban solar access by sunpaths simulation. The sky view factor is an estimation of the visible area of the sky from an earth viewpoint, being defined as {{the total amount of}} radiation received from a plane surface and that received from the whole radiant environment. In this way the sky area results fro m the limits of the urban canyon generated by urban elements, which is basically a result of a tri-dimensional environment. The tool here developed which is called 3 D SkyView, aimed the substitution of a camera equipped with a 180 º fisheye-lens by an algor ithm of calculation and visualization to be applied on a three-dimensional GIS. The 3 D SkyView extension was generated in Avenuecomputational language, developed in ArcView 3. 2 software, and used its 3 D Analystextension. This first version of 3 D SkyView calculates a new coordinate system for stereographic and <b>equidistant</b> <b>projections</b> of urban areas on a horizontal plan, and calculates SVF values for any observation point inside urban areas. In addition, the results create an environment suitable for sunpaths analysis and visualization of the whole scene desired in a fish-eye-lens 3 D scene representation, as discussed in this paper...|$|R

A designer using the AIA's Graphics Standards book, or other printed {{versions of the}} sunpath diagram must select the nearest latitude, make photocopies of the appropriate sunpath diagram and shading mask protractor, and then overlay the shading mask protractor upon the diagram in the proper orientation. The outline of the shading device is then transcribed upon the shading mask, aligned at the proper orientation for the facade in which the window is being analyzed, and placed on top of the sunpath diagram to determine if a point centered {{at the base of the}} window is exposed to direct sunlight. Obviously, teaching this process to architects and engineers is tedious and error-prone since the students must calculate several angles to ascertain whether or not a given shading device is going to work as planned and then painstakingly transcribe their calculations onto the printed sunpath diagram and shading mask protractor. This paper describes a new MS-Windows-based educational software package that has been developed to fast-track the learning and use of the sunpath diagram and shading mask protractor which is based on previously published equations for plotting the sunpath diagram and shading mask protractor. Examples will be provided that demonstrate some basic configurations of shading devices that are often misrepresented in the standard literature...|$|R
