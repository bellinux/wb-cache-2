2500|$|Nearly all {{detasseling}} {{is done in}} two steps; {{the field}} is first detasseled by machine and then detasseled manually. Machine detasseling itself is typically a two step process.

This is done to make the field more uniform so that a [...] "puller" [...] machine can then come through the corn field when the tassels have started to emerge past the cut leaves and pull the tassel out of the plant.

[...] In September 1903, McKenzie, then 32 years old, applied to the Indian Service and accepted a position as principal teacher at the Wind River Indian Reservation Boarding School at Fort Washakie, Wyoming. In his position as Principal Teacher on the Wind River Boarding School, shared by the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes, McKenzie oversaw instruction of approximately 170 Indian children and taught the most advanced students reading, writing, and arithmetic. As was often the case at Indian boarding schools, teachers performed several functions outside the classroom, and in addition to his teaching and supervisory responsibilities, McKenzie played the organ and piano at chapel and church services, led a band, occasionally supervised the dining hall and fed the school's chickens. By all accounts, McKenzie was well liked by both students and faculty. McKenzie's observations and experience at Wind River provided important information for his dissertation and a new approach toward addressing the Indian problem. At Wind River Reservation, McKenzie began a lifelong association Rev. Sherman Coolidge, an Arapaho Episcopalian priest and missionary. McKenzie often invited Rev. Coolidge and Dr. Charles Eastman to lecture in his classes at Ohio State University and at public events. They also shared their ideas about forming the first national association run by Indians for Indians.|$|E
