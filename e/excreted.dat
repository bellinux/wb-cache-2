5|$|When ingested, {{only about}} 0.05% of {{samarium}} salts is {{absorbed into the}} bloodstream and the remainder is <b>excreted.</b> From the blood, about 45% goes to the liver and 45% is deposited {{on the surface of}} the bones where it remains for about 10 years; the balance 10% is <b>excreted.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2016, {{three new}} major {{metabolites}} of bupropion, all formed exclusively by CYP2C19, were identified. These include 4'-OH-bupropion, erythro-4'-OH-hydrobupropion and threo-4'-OH-hydrobupropion, and represent 24% of {{a dose of}} bupropion <b>excreted</b> in urine. For comparison, bupropion and its three previously known primary metabolites, hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion represent 23% of a dose of bupropion <b>excreted</b> in urine.|$|E

5|$|Lead has no {{confirmed}} biological role. Its prevalence in {{the human}} body—at an adult average of 120mg—is nevertheless exceeded only by zinc (2500mg) and iron (4000mg) among the heavy metals. Lead salts are very efficiently absorbed by the body. A small amount of lead (1%) is stored in bones; the rest is <b>excreted</b> in urine and feces {{within a few weeks}} of exposure. Only about a third of lead is <b>excreted</b> by a child. Continual exposure may result in the bioaccumulation of lead.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{also serve}} a {{protective}} role. Several blood-borne substances, {{such as a}} few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are <b>excreted</b> through the lungs. Drugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified or <b>excreted</b> in the lungs. The lungs filter out small blood clots from veins and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.|$|E
5|$|The metabolites, {{as well as}} some unmetabolized alprazolam, are {{filtered}} out by the kidneys and are <b>excreted</b> in the urine.|$|E
40|$|Animals {{exposed to}} desert and salt-water environments {{must be able}} to <b>excrete</b> waste {{products}} and electrolytes {{and at the same time}} maintain a state of positive water balance.

40|$|In {{addition}} to <b>excreting</b> lignin-degrading peroxidases, the white rot fungus Phanerochaete flavido-alba also <b>excretes</b> a laccase. This protein was purified to homogeneity {{and found to}} have a molecular weight of 94, 000 and an isoelectric point lower than 3. 55. Its UV-visible spectrum is typical of copper-containing proteins...|$|R
40|$|Several mutants of Citrobacter intermedius C 3 lacking {{both the}} ability to {{synthesize}} proline and {{the ability to}} <b>excrete</b> glutamic acid were isolated by treatment with nitrosoguanidine. No revertants for either characteristic were obtained from these mutants. The ability to <b>excrete</b> glutamic acid was transferred to those mutants with very high frequencies in mating experience by using auxotropic <b>excreting</b> strains as donors. Moreover, the ability to synthesize proline was transferred together with the ability to <b>excrete</b> glutamic acid when an <b>excreting</b> strain was used as donor. The transconjugants showed a rapid spontaneous curing of both genetic markers. It was shown by two different methods that a band of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid is present in the cesium chloride gradients corresponding to the wild type and excretor mutants. Nonexcretor mutants described herein lacked such a band. Pro + transformants that were also excretors were obtained with plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid isolated either from wild type or from an excretor mutant. These data strongly indicate that glutamic acid excretion in C. intermedius C 3 is related to the presence of extrachromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid...|$|R
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{cross the}} placenta, enter the fetus, {{and are also}} <b>excreted</b> in breast milk. Chronic {{administration}} of diazepam, another benzodiazepine, to nursing mothers {{has been reported to}} cause their infants to become lethargic and to lose weight.|$|E
5|$|Excess calcium in {{the urine}} (hypercalciuria) occurs due to {{increased}} bone demineralisation with acidosis. Bones {{are mainly composed of}} calcium phosphate. The phosphate reacts with the acid, and the calcium is <b>excreted</b> by the kidneys.|$|E
5|$|In the chaetonotidans, the {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} {{a single pair of}} protonephridia, which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal, usually in the midsection of the body. In the macrodasyidans, there are several pairs of these opening {{along the side of the}} body. Nitrogenous waste is probably <b>excreted</b> through the body wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation. Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum. These cells, termed cyrtocytes, connect to a single outlet cell which passes the <b>excreted</b> material into the protonephridial duct.|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus faecalis strains {{harboring}} the conjugative plasmid pAD 1 <b>excrete</b> a small peptide, iAD 1, which inhibits the sex pheromone cAD 1. Studies {{making use}} of the host strain Streptococcus faecium 9790, which normally does not <b>excrete</b> peptide pheromones, suggest that iAD 1 may be determined directly by pAD 1...|$|R
50|$|In Madagascar, some gecko {{species in}} the genera Phelsuma and Lygodactylus are known to {{approach}} flatid plant-hoppers on tree-trunks from below and induce them to <b>excrete</b> honeydew by head nodding behaviour. The plant-hopper then raises its abdomen and <b>excretes</b> a drop of honeydew almost right onto the snout of the gecko.|$|R

5|$|Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by {{oxidation}} of the morpholine ring, without {{involvement of}} the cytochrome P450 system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive metabolites (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an <b>excreted</b> dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of which {{accounts for more than}} 1% of an <b>excreted</b> dose. Clearance of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men. There is a strong correlation between linezolid clearance and creatinine clearance (CLCR).|$|E
5|$|The kidneys and {{excretory}} {{system are}} {{much the same}} as in other reptiles, but crocodilians do not have a bladder. In fresh water, the osmolality (the concentration of solutes that contribute to a solution's osmotic pressure) in the plasma is much higher {{than it is in the}} surrounding water. The animals are well-hydrated, and the urine in the cloaca is abundant and dilute, nitrogen being <b>excreted</b> as ammonium bicarbonate. Sodium loss is low and mainly takes place through the skin in freshwater conditions. In seawater, the opposite is true. The osmolality in the plasma is lower than the surrounding water, which is dehydrating for the animal. The cloacal urine is much more concentrated, white, and opaque, with the nitrogenous waste being mostly <b>excreted</b> as insoluble uric acid.|$|E
5|$|A {{chelating}} agent is a molecule {{with at least}} two negatively charged groups that allow it to form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead. The chelate that is thus formed is nontoxic and can be <b>excreted</b> in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The {{chelating agent}}s used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally.|$|E
5|$|There are two kidneys located dorsally, {{near the}} roof of the body cavity. Their job is to filter the blood of {{metabolic}} waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians <b>excrete</b> the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, <b>excrete</b> the less toxic product urea. Some tree frogs with limited access to water <b>excrete</b> most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.|$|R

25|$|The {{end-product}} of catabolism {{of protein}} metabolism in animals is nitrogen. Animals must <b>excrete</b> this {{in the form of}} nitrogenous compounds. Ostriches are uricotelic. They <b>excrete</b> nitrogen as the complex nitrogenous waste compound uric acid, and related derivatives. Uric acid's low solubility in water gives a semi-solid paste consistency to the ostrich's nitrogenous waste.|$|R
5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} and <b>excreted</b> by acetic acid bacteria, notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs, water, and soil, and acetic acid {{is produced}} naturally as fruits and other foods spoil. Acetic acid {{is also a}} component of the vaginal lubrication of humans and other primates, where it appears to serve as a mild antibacterial agent.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's The Parts of Animals {{sets out}} enough {{details of his}} views on {{metabolism}} for an open flow model to be made. He believed that at each stage of the process, materials from food were transformed, with heat being released as the classical element of fire, and residual materials being <b>excreted</b> as urine, bile, or faeces.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} implies, the mistle thrush is {{important}} in propagating the mistletoe, an aerial parasite, which needs its seeds to be deposited on the branches of suitable trees. The highly nutritious fruits are favoured by the thrush, which digests the flesh leaving the sticky seeds to be <b>excreted,</b> possibly in a suitable location for germination.|$|E
40|$|There was no {{correlation}} between glutamate dehydrogenase activity {{and the ability to}} <b>excrete</b> glutamic acid in the wild type and two auxotrophic mutants of Citrobacter inter-medius. Differences in the ability to <b>excrete</b> glutamic acid were attributed to mechanisms which regulated the availability of 2 -oxoglutarate, as this intermediate induced the synthesis of glutamate synthase...|$|R

50|$|TEPP {{and most}} of the other {{organophosphates}} are detoxified by oxidation and hydrolysis. Due to this oxidation and hydrolysis the compound gets more polar, which makes it much easier to <b>excrete</b> via the urine. Note that TEPP is a lipophilic compound, so it can diffuse through tissues easily. This makes it hard to <b>excrete</b> TEPP.|$|R
5|$|Bufotenin, {{one of the}} {{chemicals}} <b>excreted</b> by the cane toad, is classified as a class-1 drug under Australian law, alongside heroin and cannabis. The effects of bufotenin {{are thought to be}} similar to those of mild poisoning; the stimulation, which includes mild hallucinations, lasts for less than an hour. As the cane toad excretes bufotenin in small amounts, and other toxins in relatively large quantities, toad licking could result in serious illness or death.|$|E
5|$|Copper is an {{essential}} trace element in plants and animals, but not all microorganisms. The human body contains copper {{at a level of}} about 1.4 to 2.1mg per kg of body mass. Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase, which involves the protein ceruloplasmin, carrying the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is <b>excreted</b> in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5mg a day, vs. about 1mg per day absorbed in the diet and <b>excreted</b> from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} {{molybdenum}} {{can interfere with}} the body's uptake of copper, producing copper deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it also increases the amount of copper that is <b>excreted</b> in urine. Ruminants that consume high levels of molybdenum suffer from diarrhea, stunted growth, anemia, and achromotrichia (loss of fur pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection. The effective copper deficiency, can be aggravated by excess sulfur.|$|E
