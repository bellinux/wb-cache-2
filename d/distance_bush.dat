5000|$|Accordingly, the [...] "flashlight analogy" [...] is used {{to explain}} the inseparability of action and {{knowledge}} present in this theory. One should imagine {{he is in a}} dark field at night with only a flashlight. He can vaguely pick out objects around him, but can't really tell what they are. Is that lump in the <b>distance</b> a <b>bush</b> or a dangerous animal? When he turns on his flashlight, however, he creates a circle of light that allows him to see clearly and act with relative clarity. The act of turning on the flashlight effectively created a new environment that allowed him to interpret the world around him. There is still only a single circle of light, though, and what remains outside that circle is still just as mysterious, unless the flashlight is redirected. With organizational information theory, the flashlight is mental. The environment is located {{in the mind of the}} actor and is imposed on him by his experiences, which makes them more meaningful.|$|R

60|$|On the way up, Lisle {{met with}} a very {{unpleasant}} adventure. He and Hallett had been sent out, with a small party of men, to enter the bush and drive out any of the enemy who might be lurking, {{for the purpose of}} attacking the carriers and rear guard. They went some <b>distance</b> into the <b>bush</b> but, though they came upon tracks that had recently been cut, they saw none of the enemy. Some men were planted on each of these paths; and the two officers, who had followed one a little distance farther into the bush, were on the point of turning, when they heard men cutting their way through the undergrowth behind them.|$|R
60|$|They had halted a short <b>distance</b> {{from the}} <b>bushes,</b> {{and now there}} {{suddenly}} appeared through a rift in the clouds an immense Rainbow.

Steadily, yet with wonderful swiftness, the end of the great bow descended until it rested upon the pink field--almost {{at the feet of the}} little party of observers. Then they saw, dancing gaily upon the arch, a score of beautiful maidens, dressed in fleecy robes of rainbow tints which fluttered around them like clouds.|$|R
50|$|The SADF's success {{eventually}} compelled SWAPO {{to withdraw}} over 200 {{miles from the}} Namibian border, forcing their insurgents to travel great <b>distances</b> across arid <b>bush</b> {{in order to reach}} their targets. Many could no longer carry heavy weapons on these treks, occasionally abandoning them as they marched south. Moreover, serious SWAPO losses were already having a negative effect on morale. ANC operations fared little better. Most high-profile terrorist attacks were foiled or offered negative publicity from a normally sympathetic international stage. While it was clear that popular support was growing and guerrilla skills were being improved upon, affrays on South Africa itself did not seriously disrupt the economy or impact the country's superior military and industrial status.|$|R

50|$|The Indian led us some <b>distance</b> {{into the}} <b>bushes</b> or woods, and there lay down {{with us to}} spend the night. The {{recollection}} of parting with my tender mother kept me awake, while the tears constantly flowed from my eyes. A number {{of times in the}} night, the little boy begged of me earnestly to run away with him, and get clear of the Indians; but remembering the advice I had so lately received, and knowing the dangers to which we should be exposed, in traveling without a path and without a guide, through a wilderness unknown to us, I told him that I would not go, and persuaded him to lie still till morning.|$|R
60|$|The sun had {{set some}} time since, {{but the light}} would not quite die out until just before the dawn, and the pines across the river rose against the green sky in a dark, broken-topped wall. Near his feet the {{bleached}} skeletons of trees, ground by floods and ice, glimmered a livid white, and beyond them the rapid frothed and roared in angry turmoil. The river had shrunk now the melted snow had flowed away, and rocks one seldom saw lifted their black tops above the racing foam. Inshore of the main rush, smooth-worn ledges ran in and out among shallow pools. A short <b>distance</b> ahead, the <b>bush</b> rolled down to the water's edge in a dark mass that threw back in confused echoes the din the river made.|$|R
40|$|As {{human populations}} expand, {{wildlife}} suddenly competes with humans for resources and confrontation arises as a result. Rural Africa {{is typical of}} this problem. We surveyed local owners of small farms within the five villages surrounding Mount Kasigau in Southeast Kenya to quantify losses due to wildlife depredation on both subsistence and cash crops {{as well as to}} discover the patterns and variables influencing farmer-wildlife confrontations in the region. We found no statistically significant correlations among the value of damage per acre, the <b>distance</b> from the <b>bush,</b> or the <b>distance</b> to the nearest water source. We did find statistical significance of threat ranking among elephants, goats, cows, primates, and dikdiks. The most-reported crops that were damaged by wildlife were maize and pigeon peas. In order for human-wildlife conflict to be mitigated, it is imperative that the many factors that affect the issue are understood. This project does not provide solutions to this problem; however, it sets the informational groundwork so appropriate conservation and management policies may be put into place...|$|R
5000|$|October 17, 2007 - Michael Mukasey appears {{before the}} Senate Judiciary Committee, and {{promises}} to block political meddling at the Justice Department, if confirmed as attorney general.

[...] Democratic Senators appreciated Mukasey's promise to impose new rules to limit contacts between politicians and the Justice Department, a promise clearly intended to distance Mukasy from the controversy that enveloped Alberto Gonzales surrounding the dismissal of U.S. attorneys.

60|$|Morgante {{could not}} help {{laughing}} at a candour of this excessive nature. So they went on their way till {{they came to a}} wood, where they rested themselves by a fountain, and Margutte fell fast asleep. He had a pair of boots on, which Morgante felt tempted to draw off, that he might see what he would do on waking. He accordingly did so, and threw them to a little <b>distance</b> among the <b>bushes.</b> The sleeper awoke in good time, and, looking and searching round about, suddenly burst into roars of laughter. A monkey had got the boots, and sat pulling them on and off, making the most ridiculous gestures. The monkey busied himself, and the light-minded drunkard laughed; and at every fresh gesticulation of the new boot-wearer, the laugh grew louder and more tremendous, till at length it was found impossible to be restrained. The glutton had a laughing-fit. In vain he tried to stop himself; in vain his fingers would have loosened the buttons of his doublet, to give his lungs room to play. They couldn't do it; so he laughed and roared till he burst. The snap was like the splitting of a cannon. Morgante ran up to him, but it was of no use. He was dead.|$|R
60|$|The guide {{then went}} a short <b>distance</b> into the <b>bushes,</b> {{accompanied}} by the Indian, where the two cut off the larger stems of several alders and other bushes, using the utmost care {{not to make a}} noise. The ends of these little trees were forced into the mud, outside of the canoes, the depth of the water being very trifling; {{and in the course of}} ten minutes a very effectual screen was interposed between them and the principal point of danger. Much ingenuity and readiness were manifested in making this simple arrangement, in which the two workmen were essentially favored by the natural formation of the bank, the indentation in the shore, the shallowness of the water, and the manner in which the tangled bushes dipped into the stream. The Pathfinder had the address to look for bushes which had curved stems, things easily found in such a place; and by cutting them some distance beneath the bend, and permitting the latter to touch the water, the artificial little thicket had not the appearance of growing in the stream, which might have excited suspicion; but one passing it would have thought that the bushes shot out horizontally from the bank before they inclined upwards towards the light. In short, none but an unusually distrustful eye would have been turned for an instant towards the spot in quest of a hiding-place.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} how a 2015 {{public space}} design competition, {{made available to}} students of landscape architecture in Australia and New Zealand, provided an opportunity for investigations {{to be carried out}} into the experiences, values, and the importance of hangout places in public settings. Following successful and enriching partnerships with Indigenous communities as part of previous design studio teaching and research activities we developed a brief for our current landscape architecture students from the University of Canberra and the University of Melbourne to explore the notion of hangouts, inclusive of Indigenous perspectives. With support from the Local Eden Aboriginal Land Council from the South Coast region of New South Wales (NSW) and the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, we formulated a design brief that involved students spending five days camping at an Aboriginal site of significance known as the Haycock Point Culture Camp. Located at the northern end of the NSW Ben Boyd National Park, the Culture Camp site is a space that has been, for some time, purposefully set aside for the local Aboriginal community to share, celebrate and transmit their knowledge. Consisting of a set of separate family camping sites, each connected to a central meeting place, the campground is located within walking <b>distance</b> of <b>bush</b> foods as well as fishing and diving spots that have been important to the local Aboriginal people for generations. And while the Culture Camp serves as a modern-day hangout, where Aboriginal families typically travel to on weekends and holiday periods, the archaeological record and oral accounts indicated that the site h as been occupied for thousands of years. Indeed, the site represents an old hangout location. Through the act of "hanging out" at the Culture Camp with our students, and by learning about the use and history of the site through the insights of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal knowledge holders, we explore in this paper how the knowledge gained through the experience helped to inform and inspire design thinking about hangout places in both regional and urban contexts. This paper features design concepts developed by students, along with critical reflections on how the fishing, sketching, bushwalking, storytelling, and other camp activities imbued their design approaches with meaning...|$|R
60|$|I {{filled my}} lungs, {{got a good}} hold on my rope, and once more {{launched}} myself on the descent. As it chanced, {{the worst of the}} danger was at an end, and I was so fortunate as to be never again exposed to any violent concussion. Soon after I must have passed within a little <b>distance</b> of a <b>bush</b> of wallflower, for the scent of it came over me with that impression of reality which characterises scents in darkness. This made me a second landmark, the ledge being my first. I began accordingly to compute intervals of time: so much to the ledge, so much again to the wallflower, so much more below. If I were not {{at the bottom of the}} rock, I calculated I must be near indeed to the end of the rope, and there was no doubt that I was not far from the end of my own resources. I began to be light-headed and to be tempted to let go,—now arguing that I was certainly arrived within a few feet of the level and could safely risk a fall, anon persuaded I was still close at the top and it was idle to continue longer on the rock. In the midst of which I came to a bearing on plain ground, and had nearly wept aloud. My hands were as good as flayed, my courage entirely exhausted, and, what with the long strain and the sudden relief, my limbs shook under me with more than the violence of ague, and I was glad to cling to the rope.|$|R
60|$|The Pathfinder had {{no sooner}} given these {{directions}} than the near approach of their enemies rendered profound silence necessary. The Iroquois {{in the river}} were slowly descending the stream; keeping of necessity near the bushes which overhung the water, while the rustling of leaves and the snapping of twigs soon gave fearful evidence that another party was moving along the bank, at an equally graduated pace; and directly abreast of them. In consequence of the <b>distance</b> between the <b>bushes</b> planted by the fugitives and the true shore, the two parties became visible to each other when opposite that precise point. Both stopped, and a conversation ensued, that {{may be said to}} have passed directly over the heads of those who were concealed. Indeed, nothing sheltered the travellers but the branches and leaves of plants, so pliant that they yielded to every current of air, and which a puff of wind a little stronger than common would have blown away. Fortunately the line of sight carried the eyes of the two parties of savages, whether they stood in the water or on the land, above the bushes, and the leaves appeared blended in a way to excite no suspicion. Perhaps the very boldness of the expedient alone prevented an immediate exposure. The conversation which took place was conducted earnestly, but in guarded tones, as if those who spoke wished to defeat the intentions of any listeners. It was in a dialect that both the Indian warriors beneath, as well as the Pathfinder, understood. Even Jasper comprehended a portion of what was said.|$|R
60|$|There {{was near}} {{a mile of}} forest to pass before we came out again in the open country, at about {{a mile and a}} half's {{distance}} from the hamlet. On our left this little forest did not extend more than a hundred rods, terminating {{at the edge of the}} rivulet--or creek, as the stream is erroneously called, and for no visible reason but the fact that it was only a hundred feet wide--which swept close under the broken ground mentioned at this point. On our right, however, the forest stretched away for more than a mile, until, indeed, it became lost and confounded with other portions of wood that had been reserved for the farms on which they grew. As is very usual in America, in cases where roads pass through a forest, a second growth had shot up on each side of this highway, which was fringed for the whole <b>distance</b> with large <b>bushes</b> of pine, hemlock, chestnut and maple. In some places these bushes almost touched the track, while in others a large space was given. We were winding our way through this wood, and had nearly reached its centre, at a point where no house was visible--and no house, indeed, stood within half a mile of us--with the view in front and in rear limited to some six or eight rods in each direction by the young trees, when our ears were startled by a low, shrill, banditti-like whistle. I must confess that my feelings were anything but comfortable at that interruption, for I remembered the conversation of the previous night. I thought by the sudden jump of my uncle, and the manner he instinctively felt where he ought to have had a pistol, to meet such a crisis, that he believed himself already in the hands of the Philistines.|$|R
