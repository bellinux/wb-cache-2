It utilizes highly integrated multi-channel isolating devices to minimize size and reduce assembly time. This single-board solution provides appropriate connector hardware and breakout of required flight signals to individual connectors as needed for various ground support equipment. The board utilizes multi-channel integrated circuits that contain transformer coupling, thereby allowing input and output signals to be isolated from one another while still providing high-fidelity reproduction of the signal up to 90 MHz. The board also takes in a single-voltage <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> input from the ground support equipment and in turn provides a transformer-derived isolated voltage <b>supply</b> to <b>power</b> the portion of the circuitry that is electrically connected to the flight hardware.
