25|$|For initial fluid {{replacement}} colloids or albumin {{is preferred}} {{in people with}} cirrhosis. Medications typically include octreotide or, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>available,</b> vasopressin and nitroglycerin to reduce portal venous pressures. Terlipressin {{appears to be more}} effective than octreotide, but it is not available {{in many areas of the}} world. It is the only medication that has been shown to reduce mortality in acute variceal bleeding. This is in addition to endoscopic banding or sclerotherapy for the varices. If this is sufficient then beta blockers and nitrates may be used for the prevention of re-bleeding. If bleeding continues, balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or Minnesota tube may be used in an attempt to mechanically compress the varices. This may then be followed by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. In those with cirrhosis, antibiotics decrease the chance of bleeding again, shorten the length of time spent in hospital, and decrease mortality. Octreotide reduces the need for blood transfusions and may decrease mortality. No trials of vitamin K have been conducted.|$|E
