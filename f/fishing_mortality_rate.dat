40|$|Abstract. —Natural {{mortality}} can substantially affect {{fish population}} dynamics, but {{the rate is}} difficult to estimate because natural deaths are rarely observed {{and it is difficult}} to separate the effects of natural and <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> on abundance. We developed a new telemetry approach for estimating natural and <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> and applied it to the population of striped bass Morone saxatilis in Lake Gaston, North Carolina and Virginia. Our analyses were based on a sample size of 51 telemetered striped bass that were known to be alive and in Lake Gaston at least 1 month after capture and surgery. Relocations of live fish and fish that died of natural causes were used to estimate natural and <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> and the probability of relocating tele-metered <b>fish.</b> <b>Fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> varied seasonally, but few natural deaths were observed, so the best model incorporated a constant annual instantaneous natural <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> (M; 6 SE) of 0. 14 6 0. 02. With the uncertainty in model selection accounted for, the average annual M was 0. 16 6 0. 04 for 1997 and 0. 12 6 0. 04 for 1998.

40|$|It {{is common}} to model the {{dynamics}} of fisheries using natural and <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> estimated independently using two separate analyses. <b>Fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> is routinely estimated from widely available logbook data, whereas natural mortality estimations have often required more specific, less frequently available, data. However, {{in the case of}} the fishery for brown tiger prawn (Penaeus esculentus) in Moreton Bay, both <b>fishing</b> and natural <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> have been estimated from logbook data. The present work extended the <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> model to incorporate an eco-physiological response of tiger prawn to temperature, and allowed recruitment timing to vary from year to year.

Tag return studies, where the tag is removed regardless of fish disposition, have been used to assess the effectiveness of restoration efforts for these fisheries. We extend the instantaneous rate formulation of tag return models to allow for catch and release as well as harvest. The key point of our methods is that, given an estimate of the tag reporting rate, the <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> (F) is separated into two components: the mortality on harvested fish and the ‘‘mortality’ ’ on tags (because the tags are removed) of fish released alive. The total <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> for untagged fish is the sum of the Fs due to harvest and hooking mortality suffered by fish released alive. Natural mortality rates can also be estimated.
