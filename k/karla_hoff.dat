40|$|This {{paper was}} written for {{presentation}} at the World Bank DEC Lectures on April 21, 2005. It is still highly preliminary and very much a work in progress, not just in its details but also in its structure and even in many basic ideas. Please do not cite. Comments and suggestions are most welcome. I thank <b>Karla</b> <b>Hoff,</b> Boris Pleskovic, and Dani Rodrik for useful discussions and suggestions, but emphasize {{that they are not}} responsible for my interpretations and choices; in fact they will disagree with many if not all of these. 2 The main purpose of most scholarly research, both theoretical and empirical, is to improve our understanding of the phenomena and processes being studied. The work may lead to useful prescriptions for policy, but that is usually the end-point of a long and winding path. Often, however, especially in matters of economic development and growth, the problems under investigation are large and urgent, so practitioners want immediate answers. Academic researchers are also tempted to offer suggestions for policy, however tentative or incomplete. Work on institutions and growth is a case in point. When I present my own theoretical models to audiences, I am almost invariably asked to interpret the results for their polic...|$|E
40|$|The de-collectivization of Vietnamese {{agriculture}} was {{a crucial}} step in the country's transition to a market economy. But the assignment of land-use rights had to be decentralized, and local cadres ostensibly {{had the power to}} capture this process. We assess the realized land allocation against explicit counter- factuals, including the simulated allocation implied by a competitive market-based privatization. Depending on the region, we find that 95 - 99 % of maximum aggregate consumption was realized by a land allocation that generated lower inequality overall, with the poorest absolutely better off. We attribute this outcome to initial conditions at the time of reform and actions by the center to curtail the power of local elites.

40|$|Abstract. The {{theme of}} this article is the {{importance}} – and the many causes – of lowlevel equilibrium “traps. ” Rosenstein-Rodan pointed out that spillovers may cause the return to an activity to increase with the number of others who undertake that activity. If spillovers are strong enough, both low- and high-level equilibria are possible, with no tendency of market forces to lead from the worse to the better state of affairs. This article shows how modern economic theory broadened our view of the sources of spillovers that could lead to "traps " with low innovation and inefficient institutions. Evidence from China is consistent with local underdevelopment traps. The article argues for an “ecological ” perspective on development, where the influences from others in one’s environment are a critical determinant of outcomes. This perspective provides the basis for the distinction between "deep " interventions, which change underlying forces, and "shallow " interventions, which do not. <b>Karla</b> <b>Hoff</b> is a research economist at the World Bank.

We present a dynamic equilibrium model of the political demand {{for the rule of law}} and show that beneficiaries of mass privatization may fail to demand the rule of law even if it is the Pareto efficient "rule of the game. " The reason is that uncertainty about the legal regime can lead to asset stripping, and stripping can give agents an interest in prolonging the absence of the rule of law. <b>Karla</b> <b>Hoff</b> Joseph E.

A remarkable opportunity to observe and try to influence the creation of the rules of the game occurred with the fall of communism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in the period 1989 - 91. At the outset, most observers agreed that were it politically feasible to establish quickly the rule of law to underpin a market economy as or before state enterprises were privatized, it would be desirable to do so. It was, however, argued that it was politically infeasible to do so. Advocates of rapid privatization, no matter how done, said "Not to worry. " They argued that not only was an alternative reform dynamic feasible, but it would actua lly occur. Granting individuals the control of property would create a political constituency for the rule of law, where there is protectio [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Unproductive {{enterprises}} that feed on productive businesses, are rampant in developing countries. These parasitic enterprises take divergent forms, some headed by violent bandits and brutal mafia bosses, others by organized middlemen or smart political insiders. All {{of them seem}} to have the profit motive in common. A consequence of parasitic enterprises is that societies may be locked into a self enforcing configuration of beliefs and practices that result in persistent poverty. In some instances the parasites are former youth gangs or rebel groups that are transformed to criminal enterprises feeding on private businesses (Collier 2000). Such bandits not only extort and control small-scale informal enterprises, street sellers and sweat shops, but the most professional among the plunderers prey on large-scale modern firms. One case in point is the lucrative businesses of kidnapping and extortion in Colombia, where guerrillas collect more than hundred million US dollars per year only from the oil industry alone (Hunter, 1996). Other parasitic enterprises act like a Mafia, providing protection, enforcing contracts, and mediating disputes for money. These enterprises apply force on a commercial basis to collect debt and enforce business contracts. ”Problem solving” that normally belongs to the realm of the state is undertaken by violent entrepreneurs and their gangs, where the targets have to pay tributes to avoid damages. Even though these predatory forms of illegal activities can be found in industrialized countries – with the Sicilian and the We thank Kaushik Basu for productive discussions. We have also benefitted from useful comments by Sam Bowles and <b>Karla</b> <b>Hoff.</b> We are grateful for support from the Norwegian Research Council. 1 Parasites 2 American Mafia the best-known examples– they are more prevalent and more burdensome in developing countries and in the transition economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In the transition countries the institutional vacuum created by the collapse of communism has opened the scene for extortion by such mafia-like parasites. Their activities belong to the growing shadow economy (Campos 2000). One example is private enforcement of business contracts, by threat of violence from criminal gangs, that became routine in the Russian business world in the 1990 s. As Volkov observed, “[b]efore signing formal business contracts, companies acquire information on each other’s enforcement partners (whom do you work with?) ”(Volkov 1999 p. 746). Such criminal gangs can obtain a considerable influence over private businesses. According to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, criminal gangs in 1994 controlled 40, 000 Russian businesses (Volkov 1999). Parasitic enterprises can also be run by middlemen who organize marketing boards with substantial monopsony power, or by wealthy land-owners who provide credit at exploitative interest rates. Political insiders set up their own parasitic {{enterprises that}} private sector companies have to consult and remunerate in order to have certain contracts signed. These activities, sometimes called straddling, are common in Africa. In Kenya, for example, president Moi allowed extensive straddling among politicians and bureaucrats in exchange for loyalty to the government (Bates 1983, Bigsten and Moene 1996). Finally, parasites are not always private enterprises, but can be found as corrupt politicians and bureaucrats who collect bribes and use their positions for own private benefit. All these kinds of parasitic rent appropriation activities that are directed towards private businesses flourish {{in the absence of a}} state that effectively protects property rights, and enforces contracts. Thus parasitic rent appropriation is different from regular rent-seeking that captures activities directed towards an active state undertaking regulations that private businesses wish to avoid or benefit from. While regular rent seeking distort political decisions via wasteful influence activities, parasitic rent appropriation challenges the state’s monopoly of taxation, protection and legitimate violence. In this paper we highlight some of the causes and consequences of these parasitic behaviors. Our basic claim is based on the premise that entrepreneurs of both productive and parasitic enterprises to some extent are drawn from the same limited pool of entrepreneurs. Parasites 3 When this is the case, the rise of parasitic profit opportunities may cause economic stagnation and underdevelopment that in turn enhance the profitability of parasitic enterprises relative to productive enterprises. Thus parasitic rent appropriation may induce stagnation, while stagnation may induce parasitic activities. Together the two links can lead developing economies into a poverty trap. In order to study the consequences of parasitic profit opportunities, we embed parasitic activities within a big-push model of industrialization. Parasitic activities compete for scarce entrepreneurial resources, as in the seminal papers on the misallocation of talent to unproductive activities by Usher (1987), Baumol (1990), Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1991 and 1993), and Acemoglu (1995). 1 First, however we clarify what we mean by a poverty trap and how it is related to the concepts of strategic complementarity.
