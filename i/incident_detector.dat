40|$|Abstract—Accurate Incident {{detection}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} components in Intelligent Transportation Systems. It identifies traffic abnormality based on input signals obtained from different type traffic flow sensors. To date, the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems has urged the researchers in incident detection area to explore new techniques with high adaptability to changing site traffic characteristics. From the viewpoint of evidence theory, information obtained from each sensor can be considered as a piece of evidence, and as such, multisensor based traffic <b>incident</b> <b>detector</b> {{can be viewed as a}} problem of evidence fusion. This paper proposes a new technique for traffic incident detection, which combines multiple multi-class probability support vector machines (MPSVM) using D-S evidence theory. We present a preliminary review of evidence theory and explain how the multi-sensor traffic <b>incident</b> <b>detector</b> problem can be framed in the context of this theory, in terms of incidents frame of discernment, mass functions is designed by mapping the outputs of standard support vector machines into a posterior probability using a learned sigmoid function. The experiment results suggest that MPSVM is a better adaptive classifier for incident detection problem with a changing site traffic environment.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} its survival, an organism {{needs to be}} synchronized to its environment. Thus, properly entrained circadian rhythms are critical for normal health and behavior, as many mood disorders are associated with disrupted circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms are controlled by the oscillating expression of core clock genes, including Per 1, Per 2, and Bmal 1. While this molecular clock is well-established in the body’s master clock, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), there is limited characterization of oscillating molecular clocks in extra-SCN brain regions. Furthermore, there are sex differences in circadian rhythms. Thus, the first study characterized the ubiquitous existence of oscillating molecular clocks (Per 1, Per 2, and Bmal 1 mRNA; in situ hybridization) in the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in male and female rats. It has been proposed that the SCN is able to entrain these extra-SCN molecular clocks through the diurnal rhythm of glucocorticoids (CORT). Adrenalectomy disrupts clock gene expression in the PFC. If a timely peak in diurnal CORT is necessary for normal clock gene rhythm, then untimely stress-induced peaks in CORT may disrupt clock gene expression. There are sex differences in stress. Thus, it was examined if 30 minutes of acute restraint stress could alter clock gene expression in the PFC and PVN {{of male and female}} rats, whether this effect was dependent on the presence of CORT, and if this effect could be modulated by estradiol in female rats. Acute stress selectively and rapidly induces Per 1 mRNA (in situ hybridization) in the PVN and PFC of male and female rats. There were no sex differences, despite greater stress-induced CORT in females. Furthermore, stress-induced Per 1 mRNA was largely independent of CORT in both males and females, as adrenalectomy had limited effects. Additionally, in females, estradiol had no effect, either acutely or permissively, on stress-induced Per 1 mRNA. The selectivity of Per 1 induction suggests that Per 1 may act as an <b>incident</b> <b>detector</b> for the molecular clock to salient cues in the environment in order for the organism to adapt to changes in its environment...|$|E

50|$|Detectors {{to measure}} {{backscattered}} energy are usually silicon surface barrier detectors, {{a very thin}} layer (100 nm) of P-type silicon on an N-type substrate forming a p-n junction.

These pairs can be detected by applying a voltage across the detector and measuring the current, providing an effective measurement of the ion energy. The relationship between ion energy and the number of electron-hole pairs produced will be dependent on the detector materials, the type of ion and the efficiency of the current measurement; energy resolution is dependent on thermal fluctuations.

40|$|From an {{operations}} standpoint, {{the most}} important task of a traffic surveillance system is determining reliably whether the facility is free flowing or congested. The second most important task is responding rapidly when the facility becomes congested.
