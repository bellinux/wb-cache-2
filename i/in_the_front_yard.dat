5|$|At bedtime on Christmas Eve, {{the family}} makes last-minute {{preparations}} at home, Marge tells everyone {{that no one}} can open presents until 7 AM and confiscates all of the alarm clocks. However, Bart drinks 12 glasses of water to wake up early and secretly unwraps his gifts, one of which is a remote-controlled fire truck. Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents beneath it. Bart hides the evidence outside beneath the snow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|E
5|$|The McKenzies had {{a mutual}} {{interest}} in tropical fish {{and had an}} enormous fish pond <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yard.</b> She spoke of heating water electrically to house tropical fish {{at home in the}} early 1920s, and of having given talks on radio 2FC about tropical fish in the days when she was doing electrical contracting work. In January 1933 the American journal Aquariana published an article written by McKenzie concerning 'Some interesting inhabitants of Sydney seashores', in which she recommended keeping sea horses in a salt-water tank.|$|E

40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} view {{of three}} houses on Adams Boulevard between Naomi Avenue and Hooper Avenue, December 11, 1932. The three houses are at center and are fairly small, two-story structures with clapboard walls. Palm trees {{can be seen}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yards,</b> along {{with an assortment of}} other bushes and plants. Adams is visible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> foreground and is wide dirt road. Picture file card identifies the houses as "good Negro houses"...|$|R
60|$|Beside {{the path}} were paper trees, all cut out very neatly and painted a {{brilliant}} green color. And {{back of the}} trees were rows of cardboard houses, painted in various colors {{but most of them}} having green blinds. Some were large and some small, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yards</b> were beds of paper flowers quite natural in appearance. Over some of the porches paper vines were twined, giving them a cozy and shady look.|$|R
25|$|Naguib {{spent his}} {{formative}} years in Sudan, where, as a child, ostriches and monkeys were his playmates, {{in a house}} decorated with hunting trophies like elephant tusks, tiger-skin rugs and rhinoceros and gazelle heads on the wall. Naguib's favourite game, however, was playing at soldiers with his younger brother, Ali. Having built a toy fortress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yard,</b> Naguib would spend hours conquering inches of land with his toy soldiers.|$|E
25|$|When it {{came time}} for the Roosevelt family {{to move out of the}} White House, Alice buried a Voodoo doll of the new First Lady, Nellie Taft, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yard.</b> Later, the Taft White House banned her from her former residence—the first but not the last {{administration}} to do so. During Woodrow Wilson's administration (from which she was banned in 1916 for a bawdy joke at Wilson's expense), Alice worked against the entry of the United States into the League of Nations.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{documentary evidence}} is Tharisapally Copper Plate, {{which refers to}} the construction of the church of Tharisapally in Quilon between 823 and 849 AD. Antonio Gouvea, Portuguese envoy to Malabar, mentions in his 16th-century work Jornada that almost all the churches of Saint Thomas Christians followed the models of Hindu temples of that period, but were distinguished by the huge granite cross <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yard</b> of the church. Despite the external similarity with temples, the structuring of the interior space of the church always followed the East Syrian architectural theology. Thus the contemporary style is formed as an amalgamation of Indian architecture and Assyrian liturgical concepts. The church is arranged east-to-west, with the interior structured into three levels: the madbaha (sanctuary), the qestroma (choir) and the haykla (nave).|$|E
5000|$|In June 2011, a {{controversy}} was created when The Rhino Times published a cartoon by Geof Brooks that featured two African American men in orange prison jumpsuits, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yards</b> of {{what appears to}} be two suburban homes.

5000|$|In June 2014, Leawood city {{officials}} {{shut down a}} Little Free Library due to city ordinance prohibiting free-standing structures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yards</b> of residential homes. [...] The family of the 9-year-old boy who built the structure created a Facebook page to support amendment of Leawood's city code. [...] Another resident of the city who erected a Little Free Library was threatened with a $25 fine. There are discussions among <b>the</b> city's residents <b>in</b> working with <b>the</b> city to amend its code regarding free-standing structures in residents' <b>front</b> <b>yards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The area is also {{fortunate}} in having retained and nurtured so many mature large canopy deciduous trees, many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yards</b> of houses. Within the district, {{there are a}} large number of trees representing over 30 different species. It has been of great benefit to the area that the city and many property owners have worked to ensure that the inevitable removal of older trees from time to time has been accompanied by the planting of new and replacement trees and the encouragement of trees, bushes and other plants generally.|$|R
25|$|The {{last book}} of the Spiderwick Saga, the story starts with the Vargas family going to a family {{therapist}} because of the children's latest strange behaviour, which Nick's father thinks is caused by his remarrying. Meanwhile, sinkholes have been appearing everywhere throughout Florida, where small black serpent-like creatures are vaguely seen by Nick. Under the assumption that these sinkholes are caused by the creatures that the giants were supposed to destroy, the Vargas kids (plus Sandspur) meet up with Jared, Simon and Mallory at Noseeum Jack's house, which is now deserted and has a massive sinkhole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yard.</b> After breaking into the house, they find more of Jack's annotations, which compare the hydra, shown {{as a group of}} intertwined wyrm dragons, to the legend of the Rat King.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Suzanne Karpelès, Secretary General of the Buddhist Studies Association of Phnom Penh in Cambodia, {{arranged}} for a bodhi tree offshoot to be taken from the original bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya under which Gautama Buddha achieved enlightenment, {{to be brought to}} Từ Đàm Pagoda. It was planted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yard</b> of the temple, where it was grown up and become a permanent fixture. In 1951, the temple was the venue for a meeting of 51 notable Buddhist monks from across Vietnam, to create a unified nationwide Buddhist organisation for all of Vietnam. At this meeting Thích Tịnh Khiết was chosen to be the head of Buddhism in Vietnam. It was during this meeting that the internationally designed Buddhist flag was first flown {{on the grounds of the}} pagoda.|$|E
25|$|The madbaha, {{arranged}} in the topmost platform {{at the eastern}} side of the building, represents Heaven. The primary altar is attached to the eastern wall. To the north of the madbaha is the diaqonikon (sacristry); to the south is the baptistery. The madbaha is protected with rails and is veiled by a red curtain most of the time; this is opened during the Holy Qurbana (Eucharist). An oil lamp within the sanctuary is kept glowing at all times to represent the presence of God. The madbaha is connected to the qestroma and haykla by a low-walled path called the sqaqona. The qestroma contains seats for the choir and lower clergy. The haykla contains an elevated platform or bema, which includes an altar, two lecterns for reading, and chairs for higher clergy. Worshipers stand before the altar, with separate seating for men and women. The main entrance is on the western side of the building; a vestibule, pillars, pilasters, and other architectural ornaments adorn the front end, and a flag mast stands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yard.</b> One or two bells are installed in the back yard to signal the timing of ritual services, the death of a church member, or to inform the public of calamities.|$|E
50|$|The {{library is}} located {{on the west side of}} Ross Street {{approximately}} 200 ft north of East Main Street (New York state routes 5 and 33). The neighborhood, just east of the commercial core area of downtown Batavia, is predominantly residential, with some institutional structures. Resurrection Parish Catholic church is to the southwest and another large brick building is to the northwest. Further to the northeast is one of Batavia's schools; St. James' Episcopal Church, also on the Register, is a half-block to the east. The terrain is level and some mature trees grow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yards</b> and along lot lines.|$|R
50|$|The Airview Historic District is a {{district}} of 12 houses built between 1896 and 1930 {{on each side}} of East Main Street <b>in</b> Middletown, Maryland. <b>The</b> district was developed {{to take advantage of the}} Hagerstown and Frederick Railway, which paralleled what was then known as the National Pike, and is an example of a small-scale streetcar suburb. The subdivision was subdivided from the Kefauver farm and included a trolley stop in front of developer Lewis Kefauver's house. The trolley right-of-way is still visible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep setback between the street and <b>the</b> sidewalk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yards</b> of houses on the north side of the street.|$|R
50|$|Under the Site, {{groundwater}} flows towards several private {{drinking water}} wells. In {{recognition of this}} potential threat, in 1991 EPA initiated an interim action (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of an operable unit) to connect the affected residences to Brunswick's municipal water supply. All water connections were completed by December 1992.In the summer 1992, EPA discovered relatively low levels of toxaphene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yards</b> of <b>the</b> residences adjacent to the Site. The residents were temporarily relocated while their yards were excavated and then backfilled with clean fill. The contaminated soil from the residential area was stockpiled on Hercules' property and later stabilized {{with the rest of}} the 009 Landfill.|$|R
500|$|In March 2007, Washington state {{representative}} Larry Seaquist caused a minor controversy {{when he was}} quoted as saying, [...] "These people are {{not the kind of}} people you would want living next door to you. They'd be the ones with the junky cars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yard</b> and would try to slip around the law." [...] The quote was assumed to be an attack on NASCAR fans but Seaquist later claimed that it was directed at ISC.|$|E
500|$|On June 25, 2010, {{the first}} anniversary of Jackson's death, fans {{traveled}} to Los Angeles to pay tribute. They visited Jackson's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, his family home, and Forest Lawn Memorial Park. Many carried sunflowers and other tributes to leave at the sites. Members of the Jackson family and close friends arrived to pay their respects. Katherine returned to Gary, Indiana to unveil a granite monument constructed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yard</b> of the family home. The memorial continued with a candlelight vigil and a special performance of [...] "We Are the World".|$|E
500|$|During {{the rule}} of King Narasimha Varma in the 7th century, the city covered about [...] and had a {{population}} of 10,000. The population increased to 13,000 in subsequent years and the city developed cross patterned links with rectangular streets. The settlements in the city were mostly caste based. During the period of Nandivarma Pallavan II, houses were built on raised platforms and burnt bricks. The concepts of the verandah <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yard,</b> garden in the backyard, ventilation facilities and drainage of rainwater were all introduced for the first time. The centre {{of the city was}} occupied by Brahmins, while the Tiruvekka temple and houses of agricultural labourers were situated outside the city. There were provisions in the city's outskirts for training the cavalry and infantry.|$|E

6000|$|... "The Country of the Gargoyles is all wooden!" [...] exclaimed Zeb; {{and so it}} was. The {{ground was}} sawdust and the pebbles {{scattered}} around were hard knots from trees, worn smooth in course of time. There were odd wooden houses, with carved wooden flowers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yards.</b> <b>The</b> tree-trunks were of coarse wood, but {{the leaves of the}} trees were shavings. The patches of grass were splinters of wood, and where neither grass nor sawdust showed was a solid wooden flooring. Wooden birds fluttered among the trees and wooden cows were browsing upon the wooden grass; but the most amazing things of all were the wooden people--the creatures known as Gargoyles.|$|R
60|$|Gossip raged, of course. Far {{from being}} disturbed, we used it, so to speak, as a handle for our love-making, which was carried on in an {{inferential}} {{rather than a}} direct fashion. Were they saying that we were lovers? Delightful! We laughed at one another <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunshine.... At last we achieved the great adventure of a clandestine meeting and {{went for a walk}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon, avoiding the houses of our friends. I've forgotten which of us had the boldness to propose it. The crocuses and tulips had broken the black mould, <b>the</b> flower beds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yards</b> were beginning to blaze with scarlet and yellow, the lawns had turned a living green. What did we talk about? The substance has vanished, only the flavour remains.|$|R
500|$|Just {{minutes after}} the game ended, Appalachian State {{students}} began celebrating on the two main streets in Boone, North Carolina: King Street and Rivers Street. The group eventually advanced to Kidd Brewer Stadium, Appalachian State's home field, and tore {{down one of the}} goalposts. The students proceeded to carry the goalpost over a mile before depositing it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yard</b> of the school's chancellor, Kenneth E. Peacock. He was fine with this, saying [...] "as good as today was for Appalachian State, they can take it up there and put it down. I can't wait to get there and see it." [...] Several students jumped nude into the duck pond behind ASU's dining hall, a campus tradition for celebrating big football victories. When the team returned to their stadium in buses at 11:00p.m., they were greeted by a crowd of thousands of students and fans. It took the team 20minutes to get from their buses to the locker room due to the crowd. The celebration in Boone was not limited to Appalachian State's campus; the Boone Mall was [...] "flooded" [...] with cars, and a sports apparel shop carrying ASU gear, Sports Fanatic, reported that sales were seven times higher than normal.|$|E

50|$|There {{are a few}} {{explanations}} as to how {{the neighborhood}} received its current name. One is that the mostly transplanted poor Appalachian residents, largely of Scots-Irish descent, who worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearby Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill would grow cabbages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>yards</b> of their houses, so that one could distinctly smell the odor of cooking cabbage coming from the neighborhood. This term was used originally with derision by people outside the neighborhood, but it soon became a label of pride for the people who lived there. A variation of this legend is that a Ford Model T took a sharp turn at one of the main intersections of Cabbagetown, flipped, and spilled its cargo of cabbages across the street. Yet another story involves a neighborhood baseball team, while Atlanta History Center documents show references to the name Pearl Park, after the daughter of a developer who built houses directly to the east of the mill houses near modern-day Pearl Street.|$|R
