2500|$|The typical CTrain station {{outside the}} {{downtown}} core allows for several methods of passenger arrival and departure. [...] Many CTrain passengers travel {{to and from}} suburban stations on feeder bus routes that wind their way through surrounding neighbourhoods. [...] Another popular option is a Park <b>and</b> <b>Ride</b> lot, in which commuters drive to a station by car and then transfer to a CTrain to complete their journey. [...] Alternatively, some CTrain passengers disembark at drop-off zones from vehicles travelling elsewhere; because many of these commuters are conveyed by their spouses, these zones are branded as <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ride</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R

50|$|In August 2011, Mill Creek Residential Trust, in {{cooperation}} with WMATA, began development on a new mixed-use development area known as Alexan Dunn Loring. The project was required to not {{reduce the number of}} parking spaces available to Metro riders.

This area became the primary metro parking lot, while the old parking lot was built into a new parking garage. The new parking garage opened in August 2013.

But Paula had her rights, and did he have the right to go, after what had happened, unless ... unless she went with him? To go now was to <b>kiss</b> <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> away. Surely, since the world of sex decreed that often the same men should love the one woman, and therefore that perfidy should immediately enter into such a triangle--surely, it was the lesser evil to be perfidious to the man than to the woman.|$|R
