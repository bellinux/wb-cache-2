50|$|It is {{important}} not to underestimate the people factors, such as culture, in selecting a quality <b>improvement</b> approach. Any <b>improvement</b> (change) takes time to implement, gain acceptance and stabilize as accepted practice. <b>Improvement</b> must allow pauses between implementing new changes so that the change is stabilized and assessed as a real <b>improvement,</b> before the next <b>improvement</b> is made (hence continual <b>improvement,</b> not continuous <b>improvement).</b>|$|R

40|$|Software {{engineering}} {{has developed}} a broad palette of <b>improvement</b> approaches such as process assessment, software measurement, and quality management. Most of these approaches have emerged in isolation from each other, each having its individual strengths and weaknesses. A discipline of systematic <b>improvement</b> is needed that realises the customised integration of the different <b>improvement</b> approaches according to the specific needs and characteristics of a given software organisation. In order to guide the customisation of <b>improvement</b> programmes, this paper proposes three base practices of systematic <b>improvement</b> that are viewed essential {{for the success of}} every <b>improvement</b> programme: (1) Stabilising of work practices, (2) gaining intellectual control over software development, and (3) sharing and reuse of knowledge and experience. These base practices can guide the systematic planning of <b>improvement</b> programmes without being restricted to the limits of individual <b>improvement</b> paradigms. Furthermore, a framework process and a support infrastructure for systematic <b>improvement</b> are presented. The proposed concepts are supported through empirical findings and experience from industrial <b>improvement</b> programmes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{motivation}} {{behind the}} idea of product focused process <b>improvement</b> {{is to make a}} process <b>improvement</b> program address certain product quality features in an explicit manner. The PROFES methodology [PROFES (2001) ] describes such an <b>improvement</b> program through the notion of a PPD (Product-Process Dependency) repository. A PPD model tells which <b>improvement</b> action will result in the <b>improvement</b> of which product quality. Because of the associated cost, {{only a small number of}} <b>improvement</b> actions can be implemented. Therefore it becomes imperative that we must be sure of the impact of the <b>improvement</b> actions. In this paper, we discuss how Bayesian Networks [Jensen (1996) ] can be used to predict the outcome of PPD models and hence the impact of the associated <b>improvement</b> actions...|$|R
