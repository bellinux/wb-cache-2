5|$|Licinius and Martinianus {{surrendered}} to Constantine at Nicomedia {{on the promise}} their lives would be spared: they were sent to live as private citizens in Thessalonica and Cappadocia respectively, but in 325 Constantine accused Licinius of plotting against <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> them both arrested and hanged; Licinius's son (the son of Constantine's half-sister) was also killed.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Tarrare {{had a huge}} {{appetite}} and by his teens could eat {{a quarter of a}} bullock, weighing as much as Tarrare himself, in a single day. By this time, his parents could not provide for <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> forced him to leave home. For some years after this, he toured the country with a roaming band of thieves and prostitutes, begging and stealing for food, before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling charlatan. Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other. He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of snake meat.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla's mother Julia Domna was {{initially}} left in peace when Macrinus became emperor. This changed when Macrinus {{discovered that she}} was conspiring against <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> her placed under house arrest in Antioch. By this time Julia Domna was suffering from an advanced stage of breast cancer and soon died in Antioch, possibly by starving herself. Afterwards, Macrinus sent Domna's sister Julia Maesa and her children back to Emesa in Syria, from where Maesa set in motion her plans to have Macrinus overthrown. Macrinus remained in Antioch {{instead of going to}} Rome upon being declared emperor, a step which furthered his unpopularity in Rome and contributed to his eventual downfall.|$|E

5|$|Hindman joined Confederate {{refugees}} in the Mexican town of Carlota, where he engaged in coffee planting and attempted to practice law. By April 1867, he was confident enough in the situation at home to return to Arkansas and apply to President Andrew Johnson for a pardon. Hindman's application {{was one of the}} few denied; nonetheless, he attempted to return to his former life. Politics still called to him and, although ineligible to run for office, he came out against the Reconstruction Constitution, which put him in direct conflict with reconstruction authorities. These authorities revived a treason indictment against <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> him arrested. This did not stop Hindman, who went on the political circuit and had some success building an unlikely coalition of newly freed slaves and Democrats.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Zara Yaqob became more despotic. When Takla Hawariat, abbot of Dabra Libanos, criticized Yaqob's beatings {{and murder of}} men, the emperor had the abbot himself beaten and imprisoned, where he died after few months. Zara Yaqob was {{convinced}} of a plot against him in 1453, which led to more brutal actions. He increasingly became convinced that {{his wife and children}} were plotting against <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> several of them beaten. Seyon Morgasa, the mother of the future emperor Baeda Maryam I, died from this mistreatment in 1462, which led to a complete break between son and father. Eventually relations between the two were repaired, and Zara Yaqob publicly designated Baeda Maryam as his successor.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a serious}} {{allegation}} to make against a physician. Reich wrote in his diary that the mother had been attracted to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> made the allegation to damage him. She later committed suicide and Reich blamed himself. If Kahn did have an abortion, Turner wrote, {{she was the first}} of four of Reich's partners to do so: his first wife had several, and his long-term partners Elsa Lindenberg and Ilse Ollendorf (his second wife) each had one at Reich's insistence.|$|E

5|$|Relations between an-Nasir Yusuf and the Bahri Mamluks grew tense {{after the}} former refused to invade Egypt. In October 1257, Baibars {{and his fellow}} Mamluks left Damascus or were {{expelled}} {{from the city and}} together they moved south to Jerusalem. When the governor Kutuk refused to aid them against an-Nasir Yusuf, Baibars deposed <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> al-Mugith Umar, the emir of Karak, pronounced in the khutba at the al-Aqsa Mosque; over the years, al-Mugith Umar had allowed the political dissidents of Cairo and Damascus, who sought protection from either the Mamluk and Ayyubid authorities, a safe haven within his territory.|$|E
5|$|Ruth soon {{realized}} that Fuchs had deceived <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> no intention of making him manager or giving him any significant off-field duties. He later stated that his only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets. Ruth also found out that far from giving him {{a share of the}} profits, Fuchs wanted him to invest some of his money in the team in a last-ditch effort to improve its balance sheet. As it turned out, both Fuchs and Ruppert had known all along that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.|$|E
5|$|The Allies became {{sufficiently}} {{disturbed by}} German plots revolving around the Duke that President Roosevelt ordered covert surveillance of the Duke and Duchess when they visited Palm Beach, Florida, in April 1941. Duke Carl Alexander of Württemberg (then a monk in an American monastery) {{had told the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation that the Duchess had slept with the German ambassador in London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, in 1936, had remained in constant contact with <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> continued to leak secrets.|$|E

5|$|Abu'l-Aswar {{is first}} {{recorded}} by the history of Matthew of Edessa in 1040, when the Armenian nobleman Abirat, who had become embroiled in the dispute between Gagik I's sons Ashot IV and Hovhannes-Smbat III, came to Dvin. Fearful of the latter's displeasure, Abirat with 12,000 horsemen sought Abu'l-Aswar's protection. Abu'l-Aswar initially welcomed Abirat {{and gave him a}} high position, but soon came to mistrust <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> him killed, whereupon Abirat's lieutenant Sare departed for Ani with Abirat's supporters. Despite their kinship, {{at about the same time}} Abu'l-Aswar attacked David of Tashir. The Shaddadid army, numbering an impossible 150,000 according to Matthew of Edessa, captured much of Tashir, but David was able to assemble a broad alliance against Abu'l-Aswar. David himself fielded 10,000 troops, Hovhannes-Smbat III of Ani sent 3,000 men, the King of Kapan sent 2,000, and even the King of Georgia sent 4,000, while David also secured the public backing of the Catholicos of Albania. As a result, Abu'l-Aswar was defeated and evicted from Tashir.|$|E
5|$|At 09:00 on 21 October, US 3/187 RCT {{began to}} advance south {{to clear the}} Sukchon to Yongju road towards Pyongyang. The American paratroopers {{advanced}} on two fronts, with I Company moving along the railway line and K Company along the highway. At 13:00 I Company reached Opa-ri, where it encountered a strong North Korean force estimated as a battalion, equipped with 120mm mortars and 40mm guns. I Company was caught in an ambush. The North Koreans subsequently attacked the paratroopers and after a battle lasting two-and-a-half hours, they overran two American platoons. I Company was forced to withdraw west of the railway to Hill 281 having suffered 90 men missing. Despite their success, the North Koreans subsequently withdrew to their own defensive positions in the high ground around Opa-ri. Amid the fighting, an American medic attached to I Company, Private First Class Richard G. Wilson, was killed while attempting to reach a wounded {{man who had been}} left behind, and he was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. Wilson had repeatedly exposed himself to North Korean fire to render aid to the wounded, and later helped many to safety following the order to withdraw. On hearing that one of the Americans previously thought to be dead had been seen attempting to crawl to safety, {{he went back to the}} battlefield to search for <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> disappeared. Two days later a patrol found Wilson lying dead beside the man he had returned to rescue, having been shot while trying to shield him from further injury.|$|E
5|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Hamilton said it {{had been}} a tough race for him because his car did not feel as good as he hoped. He had also hoped the gap would be closer than it was in qualifying. Webber stated that he enjoyed {{the first part of the}} event and was looking forward to the next race of the season. Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to pass <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in the error of fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers was an example of cause and effect. He wanted to disregard the issue and look forward to the next few races. The team received a warning from the stewards and avoided disqualification because they had recognised their mistake immediately.|$|E

5|$|On lap 21, Rosberg made a {{pit stop}} for the {{intermediate}} tyres, leaving only Ricciardo and Hamilton {{at the front of}} the field on the full wet tyres. Ricciardo made the switch on lap 24, but Hamilton stayed out, opting to remain on the wet tyre until the track dried out enough to go straight to slicks. In the meantime, Verstappen had fought his way back into the top ten, after having started 21st. In the subsequent laps, Ricciardo was able to reduce the gap to Hamilton in the lead, edging as close as half a second by lap 28. Behind the leading pair, Rosberg was third ahead of Pérez and Vettel. The pivotal moment of the race followed on lap 31, when Hamilton changed to slick tyres. When Ricciardo followed suit a lap later, his pit crew were not ready for <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> the wrong tyres, resulting in a long stop, handing the lead to Hamilton, who stayed narrowly ahead of him. Sergio Pérez was another driver who benefited during the second round of stops, emerging in third. Rosberg was left in sixth after both Vettel and Alonso also came out ahead of him after the switch to dry tyres. On lap 34, Ricciardo made an attempt to repass Hamilton on track, but Hamilton successfully defended his position.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Capitals then signed Brashear on July 14, 2006, to a one-year, $1 million contract. The signing was {{to provide}} Alexander Ovechkin with some on-ice protection. Capitals {{management}} felt that Brashear was skilled enough {{not to be a}} liability on the team while bringing an intimidating presence. During the 2006–07 season, the Capitals decided to extend Brashear's contract, signing him to a one-year, $1.1 million contract extension. He was suspended one game by the NHL during the regular season for punching New York Rangers defenceman Aaron Ward following a fight between Brashear and Brendan Shanahan. In the game, Shanahan felt Brashear was taking liberties with Rangers captain Jaromír Jágr, and subsequently challenged Brashear to a fight. Brashear won the fight and motioned as if he was dusting off his hands. Ward then approached <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> words with Brashear, who responded by punching him in the face, earning Brashear a game misconduct for intent to injure and eventually the suspension. At season's end, his point total increased from the previous season to 13 and his 156 PIMs ranked him in the top ten (sixth) in the League for the sixth time in his career. In the 2007–08 season, Brashear played in 80 games for the Capitals, but his offensive production slipped down to eight points while registering only 119 PIMs. However, he served as one of the Capitals' alternate captains. On January 24, 2008, the Capitals once again re-signed Brashear, this time to a one-year, $1.2 million extension.|$|E
5|$|The {{completed}} work, {{titled the}} Book of Mormon, {{was published in}} Palmyra on March 26, 1830, by printer E. B. Grandin. Soon after, on April 6, 1830, Smith and his followers formally organized the Church of Christ, and small branches were established in Palmyra, Fayette, and Colesville, New York. The Book of Mormon brought Smith regional notoriety and opposition from those who remembered his money-digging and the 1826 Chenango County trial. After Cowdery baptized several new church members, the Mormons received threats of mob violence; before Smith could confirm the newly baptized members, {{he was arrested and}} brought to trial as a disorderly person. He was acquitted, but soon both he and Cowdery fled to Colesville to escape a gathering mob. In probable reference to this period of flight, Smith said that Peter, James, and John had appeared to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> ordained him and Cowdery to a higher priesthood.|$|E
