(root mean square) value of the weighted noise signal should be detected and displayed. d) The dynamics of the detector and display device should meet requirements given in 3. e) The overall accuracy of the instrument when being used in its normal range and environmental conditions should be ± |. 0 dB or better. Specific tests for accuracy of various aspects of th...|$|R
