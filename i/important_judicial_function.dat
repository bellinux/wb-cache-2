5000|$|The counts had <b>important</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>functions</b> in Székely Land and the Saxon districts {{subject to}} them. They headed the general {{assemblies}} of each Székely seat {{and the entire}} Székely community. Such an assembly was first recorded in 1344. Thereafter, the assemblies developed into important forums for the administration of justice. Lack Hermán was mentioned as the [...] "judge of the Székelys" [...] {{in the first half}} of the 14th century, evidencing that the counts had acquired significant judicial authority by that time. The medieval judicial system of Székely Land is poorly documented. Available data suggests that the court of Udvarhelyszék was an appellate court, hearing appeals of the decisions of the courts of other seats. Appeals of the decisions of the court of Udvarhelyszék were heard by the count. The courts of justice in the seats were initially presided over by elected officials, the seat judge, and the captain. New officials, known as royal judges, appear in the sources in the 1420s. Appointed by the count, royal judges supervised the activities of the elected officials.|$|R
40|$|Roughly 90 % of all {{international}} {{judicial decisions}} have been issued after 1990. The increasing activity of international courts {{over the past two}} decades is one of the most significant developments within the international legal order. It has repercussions on all levels of governance and unsettles received understandings of the nature and legitimacy of international courts. An important and once even dominant understanding used to hold that international courts are but instruments of dispute settlement whose activities are justified by the consent of the states that created them and in whose name they decide. This understanding eclipses other <b>important</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>functions,</b> underrates problems of legitimacy, and stands in the way of a full assessment of international adjudication. It is modelled around the eminent International Court of Justice and is out of step with recent developments. But what should be put in the place of this received understanding? The book proposes a public law theory of international adjudication, which sees international courts as multifunctional actors who exercise public authority and need democratic legitimacy. The book’s theory’s three main building blocks are: multifunctionality, international public authority, and democracy. The book thus wish to cut to the core of debates about the legitimacy of international adjudication with the driving question: In whose name do international courts decide...|$|R
5|$|In the 18th century, Walmer Castle {{became the}} {{official}} {{residence of the}} Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. The Lord Warden was originally a medieval title linked to five key ports {{along the coast of}} England; the position's prominence had faded, but it still retained <b>important</b> <b>judicial</b> and military <b>functions.</b> When Lionel Sackville, the Duke of Dorset, was appointed to the post in 1708 he decided that the existing residence in Dover Castle was unsatisfactory, probably because of the semi-ruinous state of the castle, and moved into Walmer Castle instead.|$|R
2500|$|After {{many of the}} {{leadership}} of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church were executed, it was fully subordinated to the Patriarch of Constantinople. The millet system in the Ottoman Empire granted a number of <b>important</b> civil and <b>judicial</b> <b>functions</b> to the Patriarch of Constantinople and the diocesan metropolitans. As the higher Bulgarian church clerics were replaced by Greek ones {{at the beginning of the}} Ottoman domination, the Bulgarian population was subjected to double oppressionpolitical by the Ottomans and cultural by the Greek clergy. [...] With the rise of Greek nationalism in the second half of the 18th century, the clergy imposed the Greek language and a Greek consciousness on the emerging Bulgarian bourgeoisie. [...] The Patriarchate of Constantinople became its tool to assimilate other peoples. [...] At the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, the clergy opened numerous schools with all-round Greek language curriculum and nearly banned the Bulgarian liturgy. [...] These actions threatened the survival of the Bulgarians as a separate nation and people with its own, distinct national culture.|$|R
