25|$|The liquid feed (at {{the bottom}} {{left in the}} diagram) is pumped up to the {{required}} elevated pressure and is joined by a stream of hydrogen-rich recycle gas. The resulting liquid-gas mixture is preheated by flowing through a heat exchanger. The preheated feed then flows through a fired heater where the feed mixture is totally vaporized and heated to the required elevated temperature before entering the reactor and flowing through a fixed-bed of catalyst where the <b>hydrodesulfurization</b> reaction takes place.|$|E
25|$|As {{indicated}} above, many metal ions {{react with}} hydrogen sulfide {{to give the}} corresponding metal sulfides. This conversion is widely exploited. For example, gases or waters contaminated by hydrogen sulfide can be cleaned with metal sulfides. In the purification of metal ores by flotation, mineral powders are often treated with hydrogen sulfide to enhance the separation. Metal parts are sometimes passivated with hydrogen sulfide. Catalysts used in <b>hydrodesulfurization</b> are routinely activated with hydrogen sulfide, and the behavior of metallic catalysts used {{in other parts of}} a refinery is also modified using hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
