She later recounted her surprise that nobody from the studio was there to meet her at the train. [...] In fact, a studio employee had waited for her, but left because he saw nobody who [...] "looked like an actress". She failed her first screen test, but was used in several screen tests for other actors. In a 1971 interview with Dick Cavett, she related the experience with the observation, [...] "I was the most Yankee-est, most modest virgin who ever walked the earth. They laid me on a couch, and <b>I</b> <b>tested</b> fifteen men...They all had to lie {{on top of me}} and give me a passionate kiss. Oh, I thought I would die. Just thought I would die." [...] A second test was arranged for Davis, for the 1931 film A House Divided.

Second, <b>I</b> <b>test</b> the hypothesis that in the observed jazz world edge weights contribute less to the increase in the probability of closure, compared to a randomly rewired jazz world. In other words, jazz musicians tolerate openness of higher weight triads more than expected. I constructed randomly rewired jazz worlds that follow the principle of objectively possible counterfactuals. I generated random jazz worlds that could have happened within hard constraints that one can read from the data, and from practices of jazz musicians. Third, <b>I</b> <b>test</b> the hypothesis that forbidden triads are over-represented in observed jazz sessions, compared to jazz sessions in the rewired jazz worlds. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>test</b> the hypothesis that forbidden triads contribute to success at the session level, even if we take all conceived alternative explanations into account, including unobserved heterogeneity related to the identity of the band leader.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Moran's I {{statistic}} is {{the most}} popular test for spatial dependence. When spatial weights matrices are substantially varying over time, Moran's <b>I</b> <b>test</b> based on a time invariant spatial weights matrix may cause substantial bias. This paper first investigates Moran's <b>I</b> <b>tests</b> for spatial dependence in panel data models where spatial weights matrices can be time varying. Based on time varying and time invariant spatial weights matrices, the empirical size and power of Moran's <b>I</b> <b>tests</b> for spatial dependence are evaluated and compared. Monte Carlo results indicate that size of Moran's <b>I</b> <b>tests</b> based on time varying and misspecification of time invariant spatial weights matrices have not significant difference, especially compared with misspecification time invariant spatial weights matrices, power of Moran's <b>I</b> <b>tests</b> for spatial dependence with time varying spatial weights matrices is much higher. TV-Moran tests are superior to NTV-Moran tests with the misspecification of invariant spatial weights matrix, with larger power...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—One-dimensional arrays with {{subscripts}} {{formed by}} induction variables in real programs appear quite frequently. For most famous data dependence testing methods, checking if integer-valued solutions exist for one-dimensional arrays with references created by induction variable is very difficult. The <b>I</b> <b>test,</b> {{which is a}} refined combination of the GCD and Banerjee tests, is an efficient and precise data dependence testing technique to compute if integer-valued solutions exist for one-dimensional arrays with constant bounds and single increments. In this paper, the non-continuous <b>I</b> <b>test,</b> which {{is an extension of}} the <b>I</b> <b>test,</b> is proposed to figure out whether there are integer-valued solutions for one-dimensional arrays with constant bounds and non-sing ularincrements or not. Experiments with the benchmarks that have been cited from Livermore and Vector Loop, reveal that there are definitive results for 67 pairs of one-dimensional arrays that were tested...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the relation between negative or positive qualitative troponin <b>I</b> <b>test</b> and the short term prognosis of patients presenting to emergency department with chest pain or angina equivalent symptoms. Methods: we assessed the qualitative rapid troponin I in patients with chest pain or angina equivalent symptoms after at least 4 hours and then we followed the patients in 72 hours after presentation for adverse events such as death, CCU admission, fatal arrhythmias and heart failure. Results: After comparing qualitative troponin <b>I</b> <b>test</b> results and adverse events, we concluded that the troponin I was significantly more positive in patients with adverse events (i. e. CCU admission, fatal arrhythmias and heart failure) (P= 0. 031).

60|$|P.S. Well, anyway, I've cured the chronometer. After {{knocking}} {{about the}} sea for eight squally, rainy days, {{most of the}} time hove to, I succeeded in catching a partial observation of the sun at midday. From this I worked up my latitude, then headed by log to the latitude of Lord Howe, and ran both that latitude and the island down together. Here <b>I</b> <b>tested</b> the chronometer by longitude sights and found it something like three minutes out. Since each minute is equivalent to fifteen miles, the total error can be appreciated. By repeated observations at Lord Howe I rated the chronometer, finding it to have a daily losing error of seven-tenths of a second. Now it happens that a year ago, when we sailed from Hawaii, that selfsame chronometer had that selfsame losing error of seven-tenths of a second. Since that error was faithfully added every day, and since that error, as proved by my observations at Lord Howe, has not changed, then what under the sun made that chronometer all of a sudden accelerate and catch up with itself three minutes? Can such things be? Expert watchmakers say no; but I say that they have never done any expert watch-making and watch-rating in the Solomons. That it is the climate is my only diagnosis. At any rate, I have successfully doctored the chronometer, even if I have failed with the lunacy cases and with Martin's yaws.|$|E
