40|$|Using a {{specific}} and quantitative enzymatic-identification procedure, the polysaccharide chitin {{has been found}} {{in a wide range of}} animal species. It is used by protozoans, mainly ciliates, to build up cyst walls. It also constitutes the bulk of the stalks or stems of most hydrozoan colonies, but it is rarely produced by Scyphozoa (jellyfishes) and Anthozoa, and is absent in sponges. Chitin is the main structural polysaccharide of most invertebrates belonging to the Protostomia. Arthropods are the best known and most important chitin-producing animals; the <b>dry</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> of their cuticles can contain up to 80 % chitin. Besides the arthropods, relatively large amounts of chitin may be found in the setae of annelids (from 20 to 38 % of dry weight), in the skeleton of the colonies of Bryozoa and in the shells and other structures (jaws, radulae, gastric shield) of many mollusc species (up to 7 % of the <b>dry</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in gastropods and bivalve shells, and up to 26 % in cephalopods). Chitin is only absent in free and parasitic flatworms (Platyhelminthes), nemerteans, sipunculids and leeches. In some other groups, such as nematodes and rotifers, chitin is present only in the egg envelopes. Chitin synthesis has never been observed in echinoderms or vertebrates, but the tubes of some Pogonophora contain 33 % chitin, while tunicates secrete a chitinous peritrophic membrane. From an ecological point of view, besides crustaceans and molluscs, marine benthic animals are a rich source of chitin. Despite their small size, bryozoan and hydrozoan colonies yield a large biomass with relatively substantial amounts of chitin. Some bryozoans play a role in the epuration of fresh water and produce a considerable biomass of chitin-containing colonies as well. The proportion of "free" chitin, i. e., not bound to other organic molecules, is generally low (less than 10 %), although it can account for 80 % of the total chitin in mollusc shells...|$|E

30|$|In natural waters, {{amino acids}} may reach 30 – 40  % of the {{dissolved}} organic nitrogen (DON), (Tuschall and Brezonik 1980), {{and they may}} be found as excretion products of living organisms, as hydrolysis product of oligo-peptides or formed by transamination reaction (De Stefano et al. 2000). Amino acids participate in the synthetic and respiratory metabolism of the organisms and represent, together with sugars, an important food and energy source for heterotrophic microorganisms (Campbell and Goldstein 1972). Buffle et al. (1988) measured the percentages of combined amino acids, after hydrolysis, with respect to <b>dry</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> finding 33, 55 to 75, 55.4 and 13 to 26  % for marine zoo- and phytoplankton, bacteria, mollusks, and macrophytes, respectively. It was found that marine organisms may uptake glycine and α-alanine even when salinity decreases to about 12. At lower levels, the animals continue to survive, but free amino acids may not be acquired, probably due to reduced osmotic regulation processes (Stephens 1972). Similarly, increasing the salinity, the availability of free amino acids decreases for their complexation with macro components of seawater (e.g. Ca 2 +). This discussion emphasizes the importance of speciation studies in natural fluids, in fact the knowledge of reliable stability constants, solubility data and accurate thermodynamic information is strictly necessary to solve analytical problems in industrial, environmental and biological fields, such as optimisation of purification and separation processes (Berthon 1995; Nagai et al. 2008).|$|E

Biosecurity measures were adopted during daily management tasks to prevent cross contamination between treatments. The effectiveness of the treatments was evaluated by microbiological analysis performed before and after treatment applications, as well as by broiler performance results. Live performance results were similar between both treatments when broilers were reared on new litter.

There was a negative relationship between forage qualityrelated with quantity-related traits. Thirty-three QTLs controlling different studied traits were identified. Phenotypic variance explained by these QTLs varies from 7. 07 to 39. 04 %. Highest LOD scores were obtained for the leaf to stem ratio on chromosome 2 H. QTLs of forage quality (total digestible nutrient, <b>dry</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> digestibility, leaf to stem ratio, seed to forage ratio and number of tiller per plant) and quantity (plant height, forage wet and dry matter) indexes were found on chromosomes 1 H, 2 H, 3 H, 4 H, 5 H, 6 H and 7 H. Most of mapped QTLs appear to be fairly stable between locations and can become candidates for marker-assisted selection...|$|E

The experimental design was divided into two periods named period 1 and period 2 respectively of 35 d each, and consisting of 3 different phases. Dur- ing each period all animals were subject to an adaptation phase of 14 d (phase 1); during phase 2 (18 d) and phase 3 live yeast was administered (T) or not (C). Phase 3 consisted in a three days individual fecal collection period all the groups, in order to determine <b>dry</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> crude protein, crude fat, NDF and ADF apparent digestion rates using acid insoluble ash (AIA) as internal marker (Bergero et al., 2005).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the effect of supplementation of nitrogen and sulfur in Bioethanol solid waste fermentation by a consortium of Trichoderma viride and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to <b>dry</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> crude protein and non-protein nitrogen. Experimental design used was a complete-random design factorial 3 x 3 patterns. The treatment consists of; first factor (N 1 = 0 %, N 2 = 1. 5 %, N 3 = 3 %) and the second factor (S 1 = 0 %, S 2 = 0. 02 %, S 3 = 0. 04 %) in which each treatment was repeated three times. The results showed that there was an interaction in the Bioethanol solid waste which was fermented by a mixture of Trichoderma viride and Saccharomyces cerevisiae on <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> and <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> The addition of nitrogen at a dose of 3 % produced <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> and <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> within the average value of 65. 56 % and 63. 81 %. The addition of sulfur at a dose of 0. 04 % produced <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> and <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> within the average value of 59. 67 and 57. 58 %. The addition of 1. 50 % nitrogen without giving sulfur can increase the crude protein content of the substrate (P < 0. 05) significantly, whereas the non-protein nitrogen content of each treatment have different effects and not real. The results showed 1. 5 % urea to provide optimal results...|$|R

Maize varieties were harvested at the early-milk, milk and dough stages and were ensiled in 1. 5 liter special jars equipped with a lid that enabled gas release only. The jars were stored at 25 ± 2 ºC under laboratory conditions. Silages were sampled for chemical and microbiological analyses on day 45 after ensiling. In additions in vitro <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> digestibility of the silages were determined with enzymatic methods. The result of the study indicated that fermentation characteristics, nutritional and cell wall composition, <b>dry</b> and <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> yield and digestibility <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> were affected by harvest stage and cultivars...|$|R
