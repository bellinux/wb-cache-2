5000|$|A {{bill of lading}} is a legal {{document}} used in {{the transportation}} industry between a shipper of a particular good and a carrier detailing the type, quantity and destination of the good being transported. This document must accompany the shipped goods and be signed by an authorized representative from the carrier and the shipper. The bill of lading {{can serve as a}} Proof of Delivery when the goods are delivered to the destination and signed for by the consignee. These statements reflect either the shipper's representations to the carrier or the carrier's notations from its own <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods.</b> If the bill of lading specifically notes the defective condition of the goods or their packaging, it is [...] "claused" [...] or [...] "fouled." [...] If no defects are noted, it is called a [...] "clean" [...] bill of lading.|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of a system for the withholding of taxes prior to the final clearance of these goods by Customs would strengthen the revenue capacity of the VAT and the tariffs to raise revenues. This system would allow the Customs Department to maintain the same powers of inspection and completion of final assessment as at the present time. The change would be that prior to clearance the importers would pay a customs withholding tax (CWT) through their banks based on an estimation of the taxes due. The estimate of the taxes due would be prepared by the Surveyor after carrying out an <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> {{at the point of}} export. imports, withholding taxes, customs, Indonesia...|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> major {{function}} <b>of</b> CHIEF is {{to manage}} the data behind import and export movements and calculate revenues due on those movements. CHIEF accepts customs declarations from traders (possibly via CSPs - see below), validates the data, and if valid records it. It profiles the data sent and will award a [...] "route of entry" [...] to the declaration. This describes the steps that must occur for the movement to be permitted, and may include automatic clearance for trusted traders or a physical <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> or paperwork for other traders.Having accepted declaration data, CHIEF and the inventory system that is managing <b>the</b> physical movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> communicate (without involving the trader).|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} how RFID and NFC could improve current customs processes to fight illicit trade. During the import process, customs officers have to evaluate which consignments are inspected and, when an inspection takes place, whether {{intellectual property rights}} have been infringed. We propose and evaluate new micro processes that leverage <b>the</b> dualexistence <b>of</b> products and logistic units in order to enable easier, faster and more reliable <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> <b>The</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> improved processes is analyzed with an example case...|$|R
