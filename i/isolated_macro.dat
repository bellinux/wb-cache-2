40|$|International audienceThe extreme {{vulnerability}} of soil organic carbon to climate {{and land use}} change emphasizes {{the need for further}} research in different terrestrial ecosystems. We have studied the aggregate stability and carbon dynamics in a chronosequence of three different land uses in a south Chilean Andisols: a second growth Nothofagus obliqua forest (SGFOR), a grassland (GRASS) and a Pinus radiata plantation (PINUS). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of Al as soil organic matter stabilizing agent in this Andisol. In a case study, we linked differences in carbon dynamics between the three land use treatments to physical protection and recalcitrance of the soil organic matter (SOM). In this study, C aggregate stability and dynamics were studied using size and density fractionation experiments of the SOM, ? 13 C and total carbon analysis of the different SOM fractions, and mineralization measurements. The results showed that electrostatic attractions between and among Al-oxides and clay minerals are mainly responsible for the stabilization of soil aggregates and the physical protection of the enclosed soil organic carbon. Whole soil C mineralization rate constants were highest for SGFOR and PINUS, followed by GRASS. In contrast, incubation experiments of <b>isolated</b> <b>macro</b> organic matter fractions showed that the recalcitrance of the SOM decreased in another order: PINUS > SGFOR > GRASS. We concluded that physical protection of soil aggregates was the main process determining whole soil C mineralization.

40|$|International audienceExtreme {{sensitivity}} of soil organic carbon (SOC) to climate {{and land use}} change warrants further research in different terrestrial ecosystems. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the link between aggregate and SOC dynamics in a chronosequence of three different land uses of a south Chilean Andisol: a second growth Nothofagus obliqua forest (SGFOR), a grassland (GRASS) and a Pinus radiata plantation (PINUS). Total carbon content of the 0 - 10 cm soil layer was higher for GRASS (6. 7 kg C m - 2) than for PINUS (4. 3 kg C m - 2, while TC content of SGFOR (5. 8 kg C m - 2) was not significantly different from either one. High extractable oxalate and pyrophosphate Al concentrations (varying from 20. 3 - 24. 4 g kg - 1, and 3. 9 - 11. 1 g kg - 1, respectively) were found in all sites. In this study, SOC and aggregate dynamics were studied using size and density fractionation experiments of the SOC, ? 13 C and total carbon analysis of the different SOC fractions, and C mineralization experiments. The results showed that electrostatic sorption between and among amorphous Al components and clay minerals is mainly responsible for the formation of metal-humus-clay complexes and the stabilization of soil aggregates. The process of ligand exchange between SOC and Al would be of minor importance resulting in the absence of aggregate hierarchy in this soil type. Whole soil C mineralization rate constants were highest for SGFOR and PINUS, followed by GRASS (respectively 0. 495, 0. 266 and 0. 196 g CO 2 -Cm - 2 d - 1 for the top soil layer). In contrast, incubation experiments of <b>isolated</b> <b>macro</b> organic matter fractions gave opposite results, showing that the recalcitrance of the SOC decreased in another order: PINUS>SGFOR>GRASS. We deduced that electrostatic sorption processes and physical protection of SOC in soil aggregates were the main processes determining SOC stabilization. As a result, high aggregate carbon concentrations, varying from 148 till 48 g kg - 1, were encountered for all land use sites. Al availability and electrostatic charges are dependent on pH, resulting in an important influence of soil pH on aggregate stability. Recalcitrance of the SOC did not appear to largely affect SOC stabilization. Statistical correlations between extractable amorphous Al contents, aggregate stability and C mineralization rate constants were encountered, supporting this hypothesis. Land use changes affected SOC dynamics and aggregate stability by modifying soil pH (and thus electrostatic charges and available Al content), root SOC input and management practices (such as ploughing and accompanying drying of the soil) ...|$|E
40|$|Regionalization is an {{exceptionally}} complex and contradictory matter, {{and at the}} same time becoming very challenging in the last few years in conditions of accelerated changes in the world. It is believed that regionalization today is an unavoidable strategic action of directing development processes on a territory. One of the aims of regionalization is to bring economic, demographic and social development processes into accord. Discordance of demographic transition courses with economic development caused prominent changes and complex development problems on the territory of Serbia, which indicate that appropriate attention should be devoted to demographic occurrences and processes in the approach to its regionalization. Proceeding from this fact, the goal of this paper was to identify the problems of regional differentiation of geoterritory and determine the place and role of demographic regionalization in the procedure of scientific knowledge, territory differentiation and organization of geoterritory; to set the general definition of regionalism from the demographic aspect, in the sense of theoretical concept based on empirical research, so as to obtain a scientific framework for research and functional approach to recognizing contemporary problems of development and organizing population; to decide on principles and elements, and point out to the content, purpose and goals of identifying demo geographic regions, in a way which would be adequate for planning regional development and organizing geoterritories. Such a set research goal required that the total problem of demo geographic regionalization is set on a wider theoretical, but analytical context, which is defined by mutual dependence of demo geographic with other regional systems, as well as with global questions of regionalism and integration ways. Demo geographic regionalization is carried out on the basis of numerous research findings and corresponding empirical results, with an idea that it serves as a basis for macro regionalization, general geographic or administrative-management regionalization, as a "foundation" for territory planning or development policy. Global and specific perception of numerous relevant components of regionalization had been carried out, with a favorable circumstance and significant basis being the following research up to now: "Outline of constant regions for demographic research" and the study of the Geographic Institute "Demographic bases for regionalization of Serbia". Unlike demographic regionalizations, this paper insisted on demo geographic as a more complex approach, and a concrete contribution of this paper refers to defining basic principles and elements of regionalization whereby in the process of delimiting regions, numerous geographic, natural geographic, anthrop geographic, territory-economical and territory functional relations and connections, occurrences and processes were articulated apart from demographic. Although not shown in the paper, regionalization of various demographic, territorial-demographic and demo economic traits were carried out for the purpose of research, which were to show to what extent, in what direction, according to which principles and in what way it is possible to carry out demographic regionalization in Serbia. It should be noted that most research on the topic of demographic regionalization indicate that the importance of certain elements of regionalization is variable and that is dependent on the regional level, and that the population change during demographic transition imposes a necessity for introducing new indicators and elements of regionalization. Having in mind all the stated elements, territorial-functional relations, realized territorial-demographic structure of Serbia and tendencies of demographic courses, as well as territorial plan of <b>isolated</b> <b>macro</b> regional centers, confirming the homogeneity of demographic development of various regions, but also researching migration flows under the influence of push and pull factors during the process of industrialization, urbanization and land reclamation, the only possible demo geographic regionalization of Serbia was presented. The isolated regions are homogeneous in the sense of functional interdependence, because each represents a region which is territorially-functionally connected to a regional center; and heterogeneous of structure, because each region represents a symbiosis of urban, rural and transitional type of structure, which are a result of differentiation of development and demographic processes, and which imply a corresponding demographic development, dynamics and composition of population. The goal of this paper was to give theoretical-methodological frameworks and a broader basis for integration of certain territorial units into unique demo geographic regions of Serbia, which would still be in the function of complex regional research and regional planning. Anything more than that (especially from the aspect of micro or macro regionalization) would require a team work of a larger number of experts, an extensive statistical-analytical and research project, as well as sound knowledge of various local conditions, historical-geographic and civilization events which often require deviation from consistent application of formulated criteria and measures for regionalization. This means that the given proposals should be understood as a principled scheme, a general framework of the demo geographic regionalization of Serbia on the basis of interdependence of natural and economic wholes, their geographic-transportation and economic-gravitational connection, development processes and demographic courses. Every concrete requirement in future practice of planning or organization of geo-territory would require defining goals and principles of regionalization as well...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we report}} on the {{epidemiologic}} investigation in a Swiss powdered infant formula production facility after a batch of Powdered Infant Formula (PIF) was found to be contaminated with Cronobacter (C.) sakazakii during a routine testing of packed products of a Swiss PIF brand ready for distribution. Epidemiological investigation on isolates originating from PIF batches from the production unit by macro restriction typing quickly (PFGE) identified an isolate showing a pattern identical to the ones originating from the packed product, suggesting this strain being the source of contamination. To obtain an overview on the heterogeneity of strains isolated within this production unit 115 C. sakazakii isolates, which were routinely collected between August 2015 and September 2016, were characterized by PFGE and serotyping. In addition, Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) was performed on 11 selected <b>isolates.</b> <b>Macro</b> restriction analysis revealed the presence of two main clusters (C 1,C 2) containing multiple isolates from various sources and time points with the oldest isolates dating back to October and August 2015 respectively. Of interest, within both clusters isolates were identified showing identical PFGE patterns but different serotypes. Moreover, MLST analysis on selected isolates revealed that isolates showing identical PFGE types may exhibit different MLSTs and/or serotypes. Our data suggest that application of one of the latter two typing methods bears the risk that strains may incorrectly be considered “epidemiologically unrelated”. Based on these results the application of PFGE using the primary (and the secondary) restriction enzyme is recommended for trace back studies...|$|R

40|$|Studies on the {{distribution}} of Mucor ramannianus in coniferous woodland and heathland soils of a podsolic nature resulted in the amassing of a number of <b>isolates.</b> <b>Macro</b> and micro morphological observations on these isolates revealed that they could be placed in five distinct groups, A -E. A study of the growth reactions of the isolates under a number of different cultural conditions showed that they also differed physiologically. The isolates could be placed in the same five groups on physiological grounds, as well as on morphological grounds. A study of the growth factor requirements of the species revealed that some isolates were heterotrophic for thiamin, whilst others were autotrophic or incompletely autotrophic for this vitamin. One isolate required some other growth factor, but its exact requirement was not discovered. Variation within the species was thus shown to occur at morphological, physiological and biochemical levels, the last two being related to the morphology of the isolates. Crossing experiments between isolates of the same and different groups produced negative results, i. e. zygospores were not produced. A spontaneous imitation of an autotrophic isolate resulted in sectors which required thiamin for growth. These mutant sectors were exactly similar in morphology, physiology and biochemistry to the isolates of the heterotrophic group. Thus a connection between two of the groups was discovered. Following the observation of occasional hyphal fusion and anastomosis in this species, the possibility of heterokaryosis being a means of variation within the species was considered. Induced biochemical mutants were obtained by use of X-rays and ultra-violet light. Heterokaryons were produced between certain of these mutants and the spontaneous mutant. Investigations into {{the distribution}} of M. ramannianus have revealed that there is a relationship between the type of distribution shown by a particular isolate of the species and the group to which that isolate belongs. <p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{solution}} of a composite periodic longitudinal bar is investigated {{in the framework of}} the homogenization and stochastic techniques. A two scale asymptotic homogenization technique is used to provide the equivalent mechanical characterization of the bar. Such approach <b>isolates</b> a <b>macro</b> and micro-scale problem. The macro-scale problem describes the dynamics of the bar, while the micro-scale problem supplies the equivalent Young modulus and density. The micro-scale is made of two different materials: the portion of each material in the micro-scale is known in a statistical sense and a probability density function (pdf) is assumed to take into account such uncertainty. Consequently, the macro-scale material properties are random and their probability density functions are calculated in closed form. The random properties of the material represent the coefficients of the governing equation of the bar. The pdf of the solution (eigensolution) is obtained analytically. A Monte-Carlo simulation provides an alternative solution compared to the provided one...|$|R

S. non-financial corporate sector. Using the estimated “risk shock ” process as an input to a baseline DSGE financial-accelerator framework, I assess how well the model explains business-cycle fluctuations in the financial conditions of non-financial firms. In the model, risk shocks calibrated to micro data can account for {{virtually all of the}} business-cycle volatility of leverage, debt, and equity. In terms of aggregate quantities, however, pure risk shocks account for only a small share of GDP fluctuations in the model, less than two percent. Instead, it is standard TFP shocks that explain virtually all of the model’s real fluctuations. Hence, the results suggest a type of dichotomy present at the core of a standard class of DSGE financial frictions models: risk shocks lead to large financial fluctuations, but these are largely <b>isolated</b> from <b>macro</b> fluctuations...|$|R
