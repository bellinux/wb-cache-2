5|$|Hippeastrum {{has yielded}} at least 64 <b>isoquinoline</b> alkaloids, which include anti-parasitic (e.g. candimine) and psychopharmacological {{activity}} {{due to their}} high alkaloid content. One alkaloid isolated from Hippeastrum vittatum (montanine) has demonstrated antidepressant, anticonvulsant and anxiolytic properties.

5|$|As {{with all}} Amarylidaceae genera, Narcissus {{contains}} unique <b>isoquinoline</b> alkaloids. The first alkaloid {{to be identified}} was lycorine, from N. pseudonarcissus in 1877. These are considered a protective adaptation, and are utilised in the classification of species. Nearly 100 alkaloids {{have been identified in}} the genus, about a third of all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, although not all species have been tested. Of the nine alkaloid ring types identified in the family, Narcissus species most commonly demonstrate the presence of alkaloids from within the Lycorine (lycorine, galanthine, pluviine) and Homolycorine (homolycorine, lycorenine) groups. Hemanthamine, Tazettine, Narciclasine, Montanine and Galantamine alkaloids are also represented. The alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time, location, and developmental stage. Narcissus also contain fructans and low molecular weight glucomannan in the leaves and plant stems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isoquinoline</b> is a heterocyclic {{aromatic}} organic compound. It is {{a structural}} isomer of quinoline. <b>Isoquinoline</b> and quinoline are benzopyridines, which {{are composed of}} a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring. In a broader sense, the term <b>isoquinoline</b> is used to make reference to <b>isoquinoline</b> derivatives. 1-Benzylisoquinoline is the structural backbone in naturally occurring alkaloids including papaverine. The <b>isoquinoline</b> ring in these natural compound derives from the aromatic amino acid tyrosine.|$|E

25|$|The Pictet–Gams {{reaction}} and the Pictet–Spengler reaction are both {{variations on the}} Bischler–Napieralski reaction. A Pictet–Gams reaction works similarly to the Bischler–Napieralski reaction; the only difference being that an additional hydroxy group in the reactant provides a site for dehydration under the same reaction conditions as the cyclization to give the <b>isoquinoline</b> rather than requiring a separate reaction to convert a dihydroisoquinoline intermediate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isoquinoline</b> is a colorless {{hygroscopic}} liquid {{at room temperature}} with a penetrating, unpleasant odor. Impure samples can appear brownish, as is typical for nitrogen heterocycles.

It is also soluble in dilute acids as the protonated derivative.|$|E
