Today s choices obviously will have significant long-term consequences for space development.

40|$|The {{iconography}} of ancient art {{has to do}} with making propositions about what that art depicts. Stylistic studies, in contrast, make propositions about the sharedness of formal properties with other objects. These can be done separately. Although many iconographic analyses of ancient art proceed with little or no consideration of style, I argue that the two modes of analysis are interdependent. I offer a methodological case that stylistic analysis is logically prior to iconography study in the domain of ancient art. This observation argues for a distinctively staged approach to the {{iconography of}} ancient objects, one in which detailed stylistic study is a necessary prerequisite to success in determining the referents of representations. In this chapter, I wish to make what is really a fairly simple methodological point concerning the relationship between the iconography of ancient art and the study of style. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> is wort...|$|E

Mr. Marinetti's fathers and grandfathers freed Italy from prisons and torture chambers, places where people were held by force.

With the Restoration came in all at once the mechanico-corpuscular philosophy, which, with the increase of manufactures, trade, and arts, made every thing in philosophy, religion, and poetry objective; till, at length, attachment to mere external worldliness and forms got to its maximum,--when out burst the French revolution; and with it every thing became immediately subjective, without any object at all.

Recently, some of Kaitakushi's pictures were used to chronicle phases of the pioneer days in Hokkaido. About 5, 000 of the most often requested photographs taken during the Meiji or Taisho era were selected and categorized in 1992. However,there are so many pictures that remain to be catalogued, such as photographs taken by Toyoji HIKITA; fondly known as Hikita pictures. In the first chapter, I show an outline of the Hikita Pictures. The Hikita Pictures were taken from 1900 - 1940. The chapter features three characteristic <b>points.</b> <b>The</b> first is the sheer volume. About 6, 000 negatives out of 6, 900 negatives made of glass were selected for paper prints. <b>The</b> second <b>point</b> is that even though these negatives made of glass are very valuable, they have been provided for public viewing. <b>The</b> third <b>point</b> {{has to do with the}} fact that Hikita left many notes about the pictures that specified when and where the picture was taken and provided details about the things in <b>the</b> photographs. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> third <b>point</b> is <b>the</b> most important because the notes also help us understand how each picture is connected to the others. In the second chapter, I confirm the objects in the Hikita picture database. The contents of the Hikita Pictures, half of which is specimens of sea creatures. The remainder varies between photographs of people and landscapes. This paper focuses on the remainder, because it includes the pictures of Chishima, or Karahuto, and other prized photographs. Although the Hikita pictures are quite intriguing, they have rarely been used. This is due to the fact that they have not been properly catalogued. However,there is a database in place of the catalogue and it serves as a reliable reference. I finished making the database, so in the third chapter, I describe how it was constructed and is used. Its main function is to help search for pictures that are used as references, and change the order according to one's preference. Referencing using the database, Hikita Pictures is <b>the</b> most effective, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> To demonstrate how the database works, I select the 35 pictures that were taken in Etorohu in August 1938, and using the reference notes, or by changing the order, I can find out the purpose of the trip, or know the location or the time that the photograph was taken...|$|R

Can we therefore define this disease? I have synthesised a definition which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> covers <b>the</b> salient <b>points.</b> “Cancer is <b>the</b> uncontrolled or asynchronous growth of abnormal cells arising from a change in the cells DNA”. Let me explain this. Normal cells grow in a very controlled and synchronous manner. In going from a child to an adult hormones and other factors control the rate of growth of bones, muscles, etc [...] They do this in a very controlled way by influencing the genetic material in the cell, viz. DNA. In adults there is also constant cell growth in, for example, skin and blood cells where new cells are replacing dead or old cells, again in a very controlled fashion. Many factors, which I will be discussing shortly, can disrupt this controlled cell growth and can further cause cells which normally are static or grow very slowly to enter into a state of high rates of cell growth. These cells which arc now growing in an uncontrolled fashion have been changed by these factors so that they no longer resemble the normal cells in the tissue in which they are found. They can therefore be regarded as abnormal cells...|$|R
40|$|Description of Event: This {{event was}} put on by the {{assistant}} professor of art education, Stephanie Danker (our professor!). Most {{of the people that}} were in attendance of the lecture were art students, professors and community members of Miami University. This was a lecture style, where she had a PowerPoint that she used in order to share information with the audience. She spoke mostly about the contemporary movements in crafts, such as handwork. She touched greatly on feminism and the different “waves” that it has. The firs thing that she spoke about in her lecture, was the “ 4 important aspects of crafts”, which included act or activity of making, skilled knowledge, craftpersonshift (which is a general and neutral term for craftmanshift) and apprenticeship. During the length of the presentation, she {{did a good job of}} incorporating different artists and bringing in real examples and movements they have participated in. Response/Analysis of Event: During the lecture, I experienced a lecture with a topic that the lecturer felt very strongly about. This fact made it very enjoyable to sit through, the fact that the topic was so important to her. Overall, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> main <b>point</b> of <b>the</b> lecture was to introduce the topic of art and how it applies to women (especially throughout generations). The main thing that I got out of the lecture, was the fact that even though times are changing and technology is certainly improving, crafts need to stay in our culture as a way of meditation, relaxation, socializing and a way to keep family values and traditions. Finally, she concluded with the reasons on why we should reclaim crafts: sustainability, entrepreneurship, activism, leisure and relaxation, creating community and saving money. Connections to Art:This lecture clearly revolved around art. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this topic could definitely be passed on to future students to stress the importance of keeping art current and in use. It is important to reiterate the fact to students that crafts are away for people to spread cultures, traditions, use as a form meditation and relaxation. Even though I did not attend the workshop section of this speaker, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> techniques learned (text and textiles to practice sashiko and kanth) could be taught to the students. It could be used in the classroom to introduce the idea of sustainability. Reflections:Overall, I thoroughly enjoined the lecture. It was a great way to learn about modern craft and the way it pertains to today’s culture and education. The thing I most enjoyed learning about was all of the different movements and event that’s have been put on in order to explain these topics. I also enjoyed the idea that people have been making their own products and clothing in order to demonstrate rebelling against mass producing and the simple idea of just decorating with their own crafts. I really enjoyed the quote towards the end by Rochelle Smith that stated “Making things by hand serves as a compliment, or antidote, to being in cyberspace”...|$|R

The pillars and the censers had gone; and near me a score of sleepers lay wrapped in disordered robes, their upturned faces looking to my imagination like hollow masks; and a chill dawn was shining down upon them from a long window I had not noticed before; and outside the sea roared. I saw Michael Robartes lying at a little distance and beside him an overset bowl of wrought bronze which {{looked as though it}} had once held incense. As I sat thus, I heard a sudden tumult of angry men and women's voices mix with the roaring of the sea; and leaping to my feet, I went quickly to Michael Robartes, and tried to shake him out of his sleep. I then seized him by the shoulder and tried to lift him, but he fell backwards, and sighed faintly; and the voices became louder and angrier; and there was a sound of heavy blows upon the door, which opened on to the pier. Suddenly I heard a sound of rending wood, and I knew it had begun to give, and I ran {{to the door of the}} room. I pushed it open and came out upon a passage whose bare boards clattered under my feet, and found in the passage another door which led into an empty kitchen; and as I passed through the door I heard two crashes in quick succession, and knew by the sudden noise of feet and the shouts that the door which opened on to the pier had fallen inwards. I ran from the kitchen and out into a small yard, and from this down some steps which descended the seaward and sloping side of the pier, and from the steps clambered along the water's edge, with the angry voices ringing in my ears. This part of the pier had been but lately refaced with blocks of granite, so that it was almost clear of seaweed; but when I came to the old part, I found it so slippery with green weed that I had to climb up on to the roadway. I looked towards the Temple of the Alchemical Rose, where the fishermen and the women were still shouting, but somewhat more faintly, and saw that there was no one about the door or upon the pier; but as I looked, a little crowd hurried out of the door and began gathering large stones from where they were heaped up in readiness for the next time a storm shattered the pier, when they would be laid under blocks of granite. While I stood watching the crowd, an old man, who was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> voteen, <b>pointed</b> to me, and screamed out something, and the crowd whitened, for all the faces had turned towards me. I ran, and it was well for me that pullers of the oar are poorer men with their feet than with their arms and their bodies; and yet while I ran I scarcely heard the following feet or the angry voices, for many voices of exultation and lamentation, which were forgotten as a dream is forgotten the moment they were heard, seemed to be ringing in the air over my head.|$|R

Unfortunately, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> script was funnier than the actual film came out to be, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we were all on a {{different}} page. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> director wanted to make more of an action film or a heist film than he wanted to make a comedy, and Jim Kouf - he was also <b>the</b> writer - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that he shied away from the comedy of it, which is unfortunate because if we had gone that way <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> film would have been more satisfying." ...|$|R
