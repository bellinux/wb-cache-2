40|$|Abstract: This paper aims {{to develop}} new {{methodology}} for the Brazilian beef and <b>dairy</b> <b>sectors</b> incorporating different levels of productivities in the Brazilian Land Use Model (BLUM), analyzing land use dynamics. Several datasets combinations were used and supply and demand equations were re-estimated. Historical database developed in this paper shows that the livestock sector increased productivity levels per hectare (in both beef and <b>dairy</b> <b>sectors),</b> being an important land releaser for other agricultural uses. Even in frontier regions, the occupation process was followed by productivity increase. When technologies were implemented in BLUM, results show that {{there were significant differences}} on land use in 2030, reducing land for pasture compared to BLUM previous version. In this sense, the study concludes that: using average productivity levels on modeling can overestimate pastureland; migration between technologies (lower to higher levels) will continue in the future; and, finally, market and agents' behavior changes might be incorporated in land use economic models, so they can reproduce empirical evidences...|$|R

40|$|Corn and soybean {{meals are}} major feed {{ingredients}} for livestock producers. The {{first part of}} the research studies the effects of renewable fuel standard mandate on the U. S. beef and <b>dairy</b> <b>sectors.</b> A dynamic and recursive partial equilibrium model was developed to study the effect of renewable fuel standards on beef and <b>dairy</b> <b>sectors.</b> The study finds that feed cost shocks have significant impact at feedlot level and relatively less effect for cow-calf and milk producers. No major changes were found at the retail level. Given the projected corn prices are expected to be lower in the coming decade than the record high price observed in 2011, the results also suggest that the higher returns provide economic incentives for expansion of the beef and <b>dairy</b> <b>sectors</b> in the future. The second part of the research employs an application of hedonic pricing model for whole algae and post-extracted algae residue meal for aquaculture. Prices and nutritional characteristics of commonly applied aquaculture feed ingredients are used to determine the value of whole algae and post extracted algae residue based on its dietary composition. The research finds that whole algae will have value higher than that of soybean meal and lower than that of menhaden fishmeal. The results also indicate that post extracted algae residue will have value lower than that of soybean meal and menhaden fishmeal. The third part of this research estimates the economic feasibility of biofuel production and high value squalene from a tobacco biomass. Pro-forma stochastic financial statements were constructed and the feasibility of multi-year financial projects were evaluated. The results suggest the commercialization of biofuel production from tobacco is unrealistic. The results also indicate the economic feasibility of high value squalene is realistic under the certain conditions...|$|R

40|$|Tariff rate quotas (TRQs) are a {{means by}} which non-EU {{suppliers}} of agri-food products can be given preferential access to EU markets within a regulated framework of quotas at tariff rates below the Most Favoured Nation rates bound in the GATT. TRQs are common in governing trade in the meat and <b>dairy</b> <b>sectors</b> of the EU, although they apply {{to a wide range of}} other agricultural commodity and processed agri-food products. Brexit poses a complex set of problems regarding TRQs in terms of how the respective parties should divide up jointly undertaken commitments within the WTO, since TRQs have been negotiated by the Commission on behalf of all EU Member States. Whilst individual quota allocations can be allocated to specific third country suppliers, individual Member States receive no specific allocation of the global product TRQ either in total, or from any named preferential supplier. The article outlines the nature of TRQs in the meat and <b>dairy</b> <b>sectors</b> of the EU, and how a simple partitioning of existing quotas between the EU- 27 and the UK is unlikely to resolve the complex issue of access rights of third countries to both markets.
