If any node detects route failure, then it immediately informs the source about the route failure to avoid unnecessary activation of congestion control. When the network layer detects disruption in the route due to mobility, then it informs the source using a route failure notification (RFN) message. On receiving the RFN message, each intermediate node must prevent other packets from passing through the <b>failed</b> <b>route.</b> In addition, if at any intermediate node an alternate route to the destination is available, then the intermediate node must divert the traffic onto this path and discard the RFN message; otherwise, the intermediate node forwards the RFN message towards the source node.|$|E

In a multihop wireless ad hoc network, {{the quality of}} transferring real-time video streams could be seriously degraded, since every intermediate node (IN) functionally like relay device does not possess large buffer and sufficient bandwidth.

In the proposed I-EPD, an IN can intelligently determine whether a buffered video packet should be early discarded. For the purpose of validation, we implement the I-EPD on Linux-based embedded systems.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is to construct a minimum cost set of vehicle routes that visits all customers and satisfies demands without violating the vehicle capacity constraints. The Stochastic Vehicle Routing Problem (SVRP) results when one or more elements of the VRP are modeled as random variables. In this paper, we present a set-partitioning-based modeling framework for the VRP with stochastic demands (VRPSD). The framework can be adapted easily for routing problems with randomness in other problem elements, such as random customers and random travel times. We formulate the VRPSD as a two-stage stochastic program and introduce an extended recourse strategy in which vehicles are allowed to serve additional customers from <b>failed</b> <b>routes</b> prior to returning to the depot or to serve customers from <b>failed</b> <b>routes</b> on a new route after returning to the depot. Computational experiments show that route plans generated using the new recourse function perform quite well, especially for problems with few customers per route, where cost savings of roughly 5 % are possible. ...|$|R

30|$|In {{wireless}} ad hoc networks nodes {{are free}} to remain static or move as well as can join or leave the network without any restriction. Owing to this freedom, wireless ad hoc networks have a dynamic topology. As a result, two types of problems arise. One is frequent route failure, which leads to packet loss because of which TCP {{takes a long time}} to recover from these losses and its performance decreases. There will be no transmission on the connections of the <b>failed</b> <b>route</b> until a new path is computed, and the instantaneous throughput of TCP becomes zero. Therefore, frequent route failure means a lot of time is wasted in a network, just for searching new routes. During the path recovery process, there may be retransmission timeout (RTO) resulting in packets' retransmission followed by an activation of the slow start algorithm of congestion control. In slow start phase, the cwnd size is set to one segment which is the minimum amount of data require to transmit over the TCP connection, which causes the poor utilization of the network resources. The second type of problem is network partition where the sender and receiver end up being located in separate networks as a result of route failure. Network partition can be more serious than simple route failure if it remains unresolved for a long time, say longer than several RTO.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Underwater {{wireless}} communications among un-derwater sensor nodes enable {{a large number}} of scien-tific, environmental and military applications. For example, autonomous underwater vehicles will enable exploration of deep sea resources and gathering of scientific data for collaborative missions. In order to make underwater applications possible, real-time communication protocols among underwater devices must be enabled. Because of the high attenuation and scattering effect of radio and optical waves, respectively, these underwater devices are based on acoustic wireless technology. The unique characteristics of underwater acoustic channel- such as distance-dependent limited bandwidth and high propagation delays, require new, efficient and reliable communication protocols over multiple hops to network multiple devices which may be either static or mobile. This paper proposes a new low overhead ad hoc routing protocol designed for underwater acoustic sensor network. The protocol performs route discovery when needed in an on-demand manner. It also characterises a route maintenance phase which tries to recover a <b>failed</b> <b>route.</b> Detection of route failure can generate a lot of routing traffic. The proposed protocol tries to minimize this routing traffic by detecting failure in a more intelligent way either by monitoring network data traffic (if present) or generating lazy acknowledgements (if necessary). Reducing routing traffic minimizes the chance of packet collisions which in turn increases data packet delivery ratio. The performance of the proposed protocol is measured in terms of network throughput, packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay and control overhead. The results are compared to those obtained using similar on-demand routing protocols. Simulation results show that the reduction of routing traffic can improve the performance of the network...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Maintaining the routing {{information}} for an infrastructure less network of MANET is {{considered as a}} complicated task. So many protocols deals with this routing updates like AODV, DSR, and TORA. During this route construction sometimes the route failure occurs & route repairing mechanism has to be initiated whenever it is required. Now this <b>failed</b> <b>route</b> has to be replaced before the loss of data. Considering AODV there are two approaches which deal with this link breakage. Link breaks between the routes can be handled either by reformation of new shortest route from the source to destination (Complete Source Repair), or intermediate route (Partial Local Route Repair) is formed. One of the key challenges {{in this context is}} that which one of the two is best and when to apply which of the two route repair strategies. In existing algorithm standard AODV uses a fixed hop count based threshold as a basis for deciding when to invoke Local Repair or Source Repair in case of a link break. The problem arises with this type of repairing mechanism is that the network is not clear that at which time what algorithms needs to be applied. So some condition has to be identified on the basis of which the decision can be taken. Also the decision must be pre-emptive so that the loss of data can be avoided before occurrence. This work proposes a novel Threshold Alarm Based Preemptive Route Repair Algorithm (TAB-PRRA) for Multi-Hop Local repair in AODV. It focuses on measuring those parameters which provides prior information (Preemptive) of link failure before its occurrence and also if the link break occurs that the network must know the time to start the route discovery...|$|E

40|$|In this {{manuscript}} {{we deal with}} securing routing protocols of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) against packet dropping misbehavior. More specifically, we propose a solution to protect control packets of reactive source routing protocols against. Most current proposals focus on data packets. Nonetheless, dropping control packets may be beneficial for selfish nodes and malicious ones as well. For example, simply by dropping RREQ (Route Request) packets a selfish node could exclude itself from routes and thereby avoid receiving data packets to forward. Similarly, a malicious could drop RERR (Route Error) packets to keep the use of <b>failed</b> <b>routes,</b> potentially resulting in a denial of service. Our solution could be intergraded with any source routing protocol. For the implementation in this work, we have chosen {{one of the most}} secure protocols, namely ENDAIRA.
