500|$|On January 10, 1956, Presley {{made his}} first {{recordings}} for RCA in Nashville. Extending the singer's by now customary backup of Moore, Black, and Fontana, RCA enlisted pianist Floyd Cramer, guitarist Chet Atkins, and three background singers, including first tenor Gordon Stoker of the popular Jordanaires quartet, {{to fill out the}} sound. The session produced the moody, unusual [...] "Heartbreak Hotel", released as a single on January 27. Parker finally brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's Stage Show for six appearances over two months. The program, produced in New York, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. After his first appearance, on January 28, introduced by disc jockey Bill Randle, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of Carl Perkins' rockabilly anthem [...] "Blue Suede Shoes". In February, Presley's [...] "I Forgot to Remember to Forget", a Sun recording initially released the previous August, {{reached the top of the}} Billboard country chart. Neal's contract was terminated and, on March 2, Parker became Presley's manager. Gladys Presley was worried about how the fans were reacting to Presley and had hardly been to any of her son's performances because she was worried he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>hurt,</b> she remarked to him repeatedly: [...] "Elvis, the Colonel is going to work you to your death. It ain't right." ...|$|E
2500|$|The buildup to Steven's exit {{involved}} in a bisexual love triangle storyline between him, Stacey and Christian Clarke (John Partridge), who is the gay brother of Jane. On-screen, Steven and Stacey's friendship progressed into something more serious in March 2008, when they shared a kiss. Steven later decided {{he was ready to}} lose his virginity to Stacey, and took Ian's advice [...] "to try to name the England football team and substitutes as a technique for pacing himself," [...] which Sidwell has described as, [...] "a really funny scene to film [...] my favourite comedy moment since joining the show." [...] Speaking of the character's impending exit, he added: [...] "Steven loves Stacey as a friend, and would do anything for her. He misreads loving someone as being 'in love', though. Things aren't right between them, and he can't put his finger on the reason why. That's what's going to lead him to question his sexuality..." [...] On-screen, Steven was unable to consummate his love for Stacey, and after an emotional rant, he kissed Christian. The filming of the storyline posed difficulties for Aaron Sidwell; {{in an interview with the}} Daily Star he explained, [...] " [...] a really good friend of mine, so kissing her was weird, but we just got on with it! But I found it really challenging to kiss [...] because I'm not gay [...] I saw the conflict teenagers go through when they're struggling to come to terms with their sexuality. [...] is a cracking scene and I'm really pleased with it." [...] The storyline progressed with Steven denying his homosexual tendencies, leading Christian to continuously try and [...] "out" [...] him. John Partridge, has commented, [...] "Christian knew Steven was gay from the outset. He noticed Steven had tendencies that he himself had as a young man – and his gaydar is very good [...] Christian didn't ask to be kissed by Steven but now that it's happened he wants the boy to admit that he's gay. He basically wants to help him. Steven doesn't want to be gay and Christian knows how he feels. Coming out is hard for any young man [...] Christian's worried that Stacey is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>hurt.</b> He knows that when you're gay, you're gay. That's it. There's nothing you can do about it and if you try to hide it, people get hurt." [...] After the truth was revealed to Stacey, Steven falsely claimed to Ian that Christian had attempted to seduce him – a means of revenge for Christian's rejection. The following episode, Christian was banished from the Beales lives by Ian, although the truth eventually came out and Ian, despite initial concerns, was shown to be supportive of Steven's sexuality. The plot has been described as [...] "controversial" [...] and gay actor John Partridge has confessed that he had worries about it initially: [...] "A gay man having any sort of relationship with an 18-year-old boy is a bit contentious. However, I think it has been handled really well." ...|$|E

Joe Girardi, the Yankees manager said, [...] "I think it was uncalled for, it's spring training and you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> people <b>hurt</b> and we got Cervelli hurt."

The band played the opening chords of [...] "All Star" [...] throughout {{a significant portion of}} Harwell's rant. The incident was covered by major media outlets, including TMZ, Gawker, and USA Today. Harwell later apologized for the incident in an interview with The Herald-Mail. Event organizer Jason Ornstein explained that he asked Harwell if he wanted him to have the DJs make an announcement instructing the crowd not to throw bread but according to Ornstein, Harwell [...] "stormed on stage and took matters into his own hands." [...] He continued [...] "It wasn't like anyone was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>getting</b> <b>hurt</b> by throwing bread up in the air ... We just had to laugh at it, because he just really made a fool of himself." ...|$|R

[...] and policemen begin to shoot, somebody is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>hurt.</b> The man from Pompton, N.J., who always wears an overcoat in July, had turned up in a Broadway hotel drinking hot Scotches and enjoying his annual ray from the calcium. Philanthropists were petitioning the Legislature to pass a bill requiring builders to make tenement fire-escapes more commodious, so that families might die all together of the heat instead of one or two at a time. So many men were telling you about the number of baths they took each day that you wondered how they got along after the real lessee of the apartment came back to town and thanked 'em for taking such good care of it. The young man who called loudly for cold beef and beer in the restaurant, protesting that roast pullet and Burgundy was really too heavy for such weather, blushed when he met your eye, for you had heard him all winter calling, in modest tones, for the same ascetic viands. Soup, pocketbooks, shirt waists, actors and baseball excuses grew thinner. Yes, it was summertime.|$|E

The whole package is still pretty good, but it’s difficult to ignore that particular misstep." ... That aside, {{this is a pretty}} decent horror experience. The film runs a little long, but part of that is due to the film’s patience. The film isn’t just trying to shock people. It builds atmosphere and constructs horrific situations that are meant to genuinely disturb. It isn’t just about ghosts popping out of nowhere. It’s more about the creeping realization that there are some things in this world that aren’t quite right, and people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>hurt</b> because of it. Laranas’ meticulously composed frames make great use of the interplay between light and shadow, setting up an eerie atmosphere that permeates every second of the film.....|$|E

The kids were never going to die that night, and they’re not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>hurt</b> trying to jump back onto the train. But Bob’s Burgers manages to create suspense in both episodes while still being very, very funny." [...] Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10, saying [...] "Shame that the episode didn’t just stick with the adults as the whole train robbery bit with the kids wasn’t all that exciting. The three gang up with Regular-Sized Rudy who is stuck in the juice caboose while his dad is on a date to liberate the bars of chocolate {{from the front of the}} train. It’s a deeply silly idea and seemed, as ever, just an excuse for the kids to toss off as many weird asides as they could. Though a success in that regard, I probably laughed less at this episode than any of the 14 that preceded it. A better batting average than most sitcoms, to be sure, but a slight disappointment for one of TV’s finest half-hours." ...|$|E

5000|$|To say Wilson was a {{successful}} horse jockey is an understatement. With his passion for racing {{he was able to}} achieve success from an early age, starting his thirty-five year career in 1972 when he achieved his first win as a teenager racing quarter horses in Oklahoma. Wilson had a 4,939-win career, which ranks him twentieth all time amongst jockeys. He also won 4,250 seconds and 3,461 thirds. His most winning mount was a female filly by the name of Xtra Heat. He was able to achieve thirteen wins and two second-place finishes with this particular mount. Wilson fondly refers to her as “all heart, one in a million.” Wilson has seven Triple Crown mounts from his career, which is considered a great accomplishment. The best day of Wilson’s career was a six win day at Philadelphia Park. He had seven classic mounts in his career. These include five mounts in the Preakness at Pimlico Race Course and two Kentucky Derby mounts. In 2005 he was nominated for the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award for high standards of professional conduct in racing and life. However it was awarded to Ray Sibille.

Throughout the first phase of her career, Carey's albums predominantly consisted of pop and adult contemporary ballads. Rainbow mixed hip hop and R&B-flavored upbeat songs with softer and lyrically intense ballads resembling those that Carey had previously recorded. [...] "Heartbreaker", Carey's first collaboration with Jay-Z, used a sample from [...] "Attack of the Name Game," [...] recorded by Stacy Lattisaw, as its hook. The loop originated from [...] "The Name Game" [...] by Shirley Ellis; Ellis and co-writer Lincoln Chase are credited as songwriters on the track. Carey incorporated the hook into the song's melody, and added instrumentation. Lyrically, the song chronicles the heartbreak the protagonist feels after learning of her lover's infidelity. [...] "Thank God I Found You" [...] features vocals from Joe and 98 Degrees, as well as songwriting and production from Carey and Lewis. According to Carey, the song reflects on events in her own life at the time, with the lyrics describing the completion the protagonist feels after [...] "finding" [...] their lover.
