In the {{background}} of the cutthroat flume of the second stem II station in the Ye River hub of Shijiazhuang, the model test is selected to analyse the hydraulic characteristics of the cutthroat flume. The results show that: (1) The influencing factors on the discharge coefficient in the calculating formula for flow deduced by theory are drawn, the discharge coefficient of the <b>free</b> <b>outflow</b> is relevant to the head above weir and the height of weir, and that of the submerged outflow has relevance to the height of weir and the upstream and downstream water level; (2) the critical condition for the submergence of cutthroat flume is determined, when the ratio of the water depth in the downstream and upstream is less than 0. 76, the flow is <b>free</b> <b>outflow,</b> otherwise it is submerged outflow; (3) Based on the regression analysis, the empirical formula of discharge coefficient for the <b>free</b> <b>outflow</b> and submerged outflow are obtained, and the precision is proved to be reasonable by the error analysis...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Haemoglobin {{saturation}} is an obligatory oxygen parameter in {{the assessment}} of neonatal oxygenation. Although, pulse oximetry is currently one of the major methods in the determination of haemoglobin saturation, capillary blood saturation is still present in the diagnostic process. As well known, haemoglobin saturation value of capillary blood is insufficiently accurate, {{but not as much as}} the difference in relation to the values determined by pulse oximetry. Until now published studies have reported that capillary samples are obtained according to a protocol by the principle of <b>free</b> blood <b>outflow,</b> which is practically almost unachievable in the neonate. Objective Determination of the reference values of oxygen saturation (ScO 2) and partial pressure (pcO 2) of capillary blood by squeezing of the foot. The determination of difference between ScO 2 and pulse oximetry (SpO 2). Methods In 134 term newborns, we determined SpO 2. Subsequently, we measured the values of ScO 2 and pcO 2 from the same extremity. While withdrawing a capillary sample, we exerted multiple squeezing of the foot. The mean value of ScO 2, pcO 2, SpO 2 and the difference between ScO 2 and SpO 2 were determined. Results Mean ScO 2 value was 80. 5 } 8. 5 %, pcO 2 was 48. 2 } 11. 4 mm Hg and SpO 2 was 98 } 1. 9 %. The difference between ScO 2 and SpO 2 values was 17. 5 } 8. 6 % (t= 23. 568; p= 0. 000). Conclusion There is a statistically highly significant difference between the values of ScO 2 and SpO 2. Having the knowledge of this difference can increase the accuracy of clinical evaluation and further diagnostics. Comparison in up-to-now conducted studies suggests that the squeezing of the foot for obtaining a capillary sample in relation to <b>free</b> blood <b>outflow</b> does not bear any significant influence on the resultant values of haemoglobin saturation. ...|$|R
40|$|We use {{a global}} {{chemical}} transport model (GEOS-Chem) {{to estimate the}} impact of transpacific transport of mineral dust on aerosol concentrations in North America during 2001. We have implemented two dust mobilization schemes in the model (GOCART and DEAD) and find that the best simulation of North American surface observations with GEOS-Chem is achieved by combining the topographic source used in GOCART with the entrainment scheme used in DEAD. This combination restricts dust emissions to year-round arid areas but includes a significant wind threshold for dust mobilization. The model captures the magnitude and seasonal cycle of observed surface dust concentrations over the northern Pacific. It simulates the <b>free</b> tropospheric <b>outflow</b> of dust from Asia observed in the TRACE-P and ACE-Asia aircraft campaigns of spring 2001. It reproduces the timing and distribution of Asian dust outbreaks in North America during April–May. Beyond these outbreaks we find persistent Asian fine dust (averaging 1. 2 mgm 3) in surface air over the western United States in spring, with much weaker influence (0. 25 mgm 3) in summer and fall.

A precise and numerically efficient approximation is presented for the mathematical model, based on Richards' nonlinear and degenerate equation {{expressed in terms}} of effective saturation using the Van Genuchten-Mualem ansatz. The main difference with other methods is the utilization of a nonlocal condition based on mass balance. The method is suitable for determination of soil parameters, including the saturated conductivity, via the solution of an inverse problem in an iterative way. First, the fully saturated sample is centrifugated with a <b>free</b> <b>outflow</b> boundary during some time interval. Next, the output boundary is sealed and the sample is centrifugated for a prescribed time interval, or up to the creation of an equilibrium. Finally, the centrifugation is continued with a <b>free</b> <b>outflow</b> boundary. This procedure can be repeated to increase the information to drive the inverse problem.

40|$|A zero inertia {{mathematical}} model {{as described by}} Strelkoff and Katopodes (1977 b) was used to simulate irrigations in blocked-end or ponded sloping borders. The model {{is based on the}} assumption that inertia is negligible. A linearization method was then used to decrease the difficulty and expense of the solution. The resulting mathematical expressions were solved with a double sweep technique. Border irrigations were simulated, using the model, for selected intake families (soil infiltration characteristics), required depths of infiltration, discharge rates, lengths, times of application, slopes, and roughness values. The output from the model, including the depth of infiltration, the maximum depth of flow at the upper end of the border, the maximum depth of ponding at the downstream end and the application efficiency, was used to develop the design charts for ponded sloping irrigation borders. These were combined with the operational input parameters to provide the design charts for a given intake family, slope and roughness. Since the same input parameters apply, the design charts developed can be used for ponded or <b>free</b> <b>outflow</b> borders. In cases of <b>free</b> <b>outflow</b> borders, ponding is replaced by runoff. Ponding can improve application efficiency over <b>free</b> <b>outflow</b> borders, provided that ponding affects a significant length of the border. Where runoff can not be reused, ponding or end-blocking a border strip is recommended. The maximum potential application efficiencies, on ponded borders, with adequate irrigation and minimum deep percolation were determined, with respect to intake family, required depth of infiltration, slope, roughness and length of run. A sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect of infiltration showed that it is better to underestimate than to overestimate infiltration. The effects of roughness and slope on irrigation efficiencies and depth of ponding were also studied.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that clinical and biochemical {{essential fatty acid}} deficiency (EFA) might occur from the feeding of eucaloric, fat-free diets was tested in two experiments in healthy men. In Study I, eight men were given fat-free, eucaloric diets containing 80 % of calories as glucose and 20 % as amino acid hydrolysates by a constant drip over a 24 -h period. The diets were fed in succession for periods of 2 wk each, either through a superior vena cava catheter or via a nasogastric tube. EFA deficiency was detected by decreases in linoleic acid and {{by the appearance of}} 5, 8, 11 -eicosatrienoic acid in lipid fractions of plasma. Linoleic acid decreased significantly during 2 wk of the fat-free diet given intravenously from 48. 8 to 9. 8 % (percent of total fatty acids) in cholesterol esters, from 21. 2 to 3. 2 % in phospholipids, from 9. 6 to 2. 0 % in free fatty acids, and from 14. 1 to 2. 6 % in triglycerides. Eicosatrienoic acid, normally undetectable, appeared 0. 6 % in cholesterol esters, 2. 5 % in phospholipids, 0. 2 % in free fatty acids, and 2. 3 % in triglycerides. EFA deficiency occurred similarly during the nasogastric feeding. In Study II a subject received the same diet continuously by the nasogastric route for 10 days followed by a 24 -h fast. He was then given the fat-free diet intermittently in three meals per day for 3 days. Finally, he was repleted with a diet containing 2. 6 % linoleic acid. By the 3 rd day of the continuous nasogastric feeding, linoleic acid had fallen significantly and eicosatrienoic acid had appeared in plasma lipid fractions as in Study I. These findings were accentuated by day 10. Adipose tissue fatty acid composition did not change. <b>Free</b> fatty acid <b>outflow</b> from adipose tissue was presumably suppressed during the 10 days of continuous feeding. With increased <b>free</b> fatty acid <b>outflow</b> during fasting and intermittent feeding, linoleic acid rose and eicosatrienoic acid decreased.

40|$|The {{processes}} and sources contributing to Asian pollution outflow over the Pacific are examined {{with a global}} 3 -D model analysis of CO observations from the TRACE-P aircraft mission (February-April 2001), and by using the model to place the TRACE-P observations in an interannual (1994 - 2001) and seasonal context. The major process driving Asian pollution outflow during the TRACE-P period (spring) is frontal lifting ahead of southeastward-moving cold fronts (the leading edge of cold surges) and transport in the boundary layer behind the cold fronts. Orographic lifting over central and eastern China combines with the cold fronts to promote the transport of Chinese pollution to the <b>free</b> troposphere. <b>Outflow</b> of seasonal biomass burning in Southeast Asia during spring takes place mostly by deep convection but also by northeastward transport and frontal lifting, mixing with the anthropogenic outflow. Boundary layer outflow over the western Pacific is largely devoid of biomass burning influence. European and African (biomass burning) plumes in Asian outflow during TRACE-P were weak (less than 60 ppbv and 20 ppbv CO, respectively) and were not be detectable in the observations because of superposition of the much larger Asian pollution signal. Spring 2001 (La Nina) was characterized by unusually frequent cold surge events in the Asian Pacific rim and strong convection in Southeast Asia, leading to unusually strong boundary layer outflow of anthropogenic emissions and convective outflow of biomass burning emissions in the upper troposphere.

40|$|The {{chemistry}} {{of the natural}} atmosphere and the influence by long-range transport of air pollution are key issues in the atmospheric sciences. Here we present two intensive field measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in late {{spring and summer of}} 2003 at Mt. Waliguan (WLG, 36. 28 ° N, 100. 90 ° E, 3816 m a. s. l.), a baseline station in the northeast part of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Most VOC species exhibited higher concentrations in late spring than in summer. A typical diurnal variation was observed with higher nighttime levels, in contrast to results from other mountainous sites. Five different air masses were identified from backward trajectory analysis showing distinct VOC speciation. Air masses originating from the central Eurasian continent contained the lowest VOC levels compared to the others that were impacted by anthropogenic emissions from China and the Indian sub-continent. The data were compared with the TRACE-P (Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific) data to examine the inflow and outflow of air pollution over the China sub-continent. The results show that the free troposphere over China may be affected by the inflow from the Eurasian continent in spring, and the emissions in China may not have a significant influence on the <b>free</b> tropospheric <b>outflow.</b> A photochemical box model based on the Master Chemical Mechanism (version 3. 2) and constrained by a full suite of measurements was developed to probe the photo{{chemistry of}} atmosphere at WLG. Our results show net ozone production from in-situ photochemistry during both late spring and summer. Oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) by the hydroperoxyl radical (HO 2) dominates the ozone production relative to the oxidation by the organic peroxy radicals (RO 2), and the ozone is primarily destroyed by photolysis and reactions with the HO x (HO x = OH + HO 2) radicals. Ozone photolysis is the predominant primary source of radicals (RO x = OH + HO 2 + RO 2), followed by the photolysis of oxygenated VOCs and hydrogen peroxides. The radical losses are governed by the self and cross reactions among the radicals. The findings can provide insights into the background chemistry and the impacts of pollution transport on the pristine atmosphere over the Eurasian continent...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that rapid {{vertical}} transport of air from urban plumes through deep convective clouds can cause substantial enhancement {{of the rate}} of O 3 production in the free troposphere. Simulation of convective redistribution and subsequent photochemistry of an urban plume from Oklahoma City during the 1985 PRESTORM campaign shows enhancement of O 3 production in the <b>free</b> tropospheric cloud <b>outflow</b> layer {{by a factor of}} almost 4. In contrast, simulation of convective transport of an urban plume from Manaus, Brazil, into a prestine free troposphere during GTE/ABLE 2 B (1987), followed by a photochemical simulation, showed enhancement of O 3 production by a factor of 35. The reasons for the different enhancements are (1) intensity of cloud vertical motion; (2) initial boundary layer O 3 precursor concentrations; and (3) initial amount of background free tropospheric NO(x). Convective transport of ozone precursors to the middle and upper troposphere allows the resulting O 3 to spread over large geographic regions, rather than being confined to the lower troposphere where loss processes are much more rapid. Conversely, as air with lower NO descends and replaces more polluted air, there is greater O 3 production efficiency per molecule of NO in the boundary layer following convective transport. As a result, over 30 percent more ozone could be produced in the entire tropospheric column in the first 24 hours following convective transport of urban plumes...|$|R

High and low right atrium (RA) free wall, isthmus, right ventricle (RV) <b>free</b> wall and <b>outflow</b> tract lesions were studied macroscopically and microscopically five days after lesion formation in seven pigs. Shape, size, thrombus formation, and ablation parameters were compared. The effect of minimal, medium and high wall contact was assessed by a contact measurement utility for magnetic catheters. Results. All 14 RA free wall lesions were transmural with a similar epicardial and endocardial surface area. In the RV, the epicardial area usually appeared to be smaller than the endocardial area with standard catheters. Isthmus lesions were difficult to assess transmurality. There {{was no difference in}} endocardial area: standard 39 mm(2) (range 16 to 82 mm(2)) vs. magnetic 36 mm(2) (range 23 to 111 mm(2)). If the catheter tip was perpendicular to the tissue, magnetic lesions were more often round or oval, while standard lesions were more often elongated (p< 0. 05). When the catheter tip was parallel to tissue, lesions always tended to be elongated. Microscopic characteristics were similar. The contact utility was not useful. Average impedance (p< 0. 0001) and energy delivered (p< 0. 05) were less with magnetic catheters. Conclusion. Lesions from magnetically steered catheters are transmural of similar size, but with less variability than standard catheter lesions when the tip is perpendicular to the tissue. Magnetic lesions are associated with lower impedance and energy delivery. This suggests a more stable tip-to-tissue contact...|$|R
40|$|Glaucoma is {{the second}} leading cause of {{blindness}} worldwide, affecting approximately 67 million people and costing the US healthcare system an estimated 2. 5 billion annually. The greatest risk factor for the diagnosis and progression of glaucoma is high eye pressure. All glaucoma medications and procedures are designed to reduce eye pressure, slowing disease progression and preserving vision. The eye’s aqueous humor nourishes avascular tissues in the anterior segment. It also maintains the eye’s geometry by pressurizing the globe, facilitating its ability to focus light on the retina. The balance between aqueous humor production and uptake {{is responsible for the}} pressure within the eye. Most glaucoma medications are designed to reduce pressure by increasing aqueous humor outflow, and surgeries are designed to enhance or bypass exiting outflow pathways. But, the effects of medications and procedures on a patient by patient basis on outflow remain speculative. Here, techniques for the non-invasive direct mapping and measurement of aqueous humor outflow in the living human eye are proposed. Mapping provides morphometric insights and measurements of the components of the outflow system, while the flow technique is the first to provide direct measurements of <b>outflow,</b> <b>free</b> of the assumptions plaguing other modalities. “Virtual casting” of the outflow system yields 3 D maps from which terminal branches are identified. Doppler measurements quantify velocity within those branches. Total aqueous humor outflow is determined by integrating calculated flow across all identified terminal branches. These technologies can be adapted to existing FDA approved OCT clinical scanners. Clinical application of these technologies may improve the management of glaucoma by reducing the time needed to determine and implement optimal therapeutic strategies, thereby preserving vision in glaucoma patients...|$|R
40|$|Analogue models or scale {{experiments}} of estuaries {{and short}} tidal basins are notoriously difficult to create {{in the laboratory}} {{because of the difficulty}} to obtain currents strong enough to transport sand. Our recently discovered method to drive tidal currents by periodically tilting the entire flume leads to intense sediment transport in both the ebb and flood phase, causing dynamic channel and shoal patterns. However, it remains unclear whether tilting produces periodic flows with characteristic tidal properties that are sufficiently similar to those in nature for the purpose of landscape experiments. Moreover, it is not well understood why the flows driven by periodic sea level fluctuation, as in nature, are not sufficient for morphodynamic experiments. Here we compare {{for the first time the}} tidal currents driven by sea level fluctuations and by tilting. Experiments were run in a 20  [*]×[*]  3  m straight flume, the Metronome, for a range of tilting periods and with one or two boundaries open at constant head with <b>free</b> inflow and <b>outflow.</b> Also, experiments were run with flow driven by periodic sea level fluctuations. We recorded surface flow velocity along the flume with particle imaging velocimetry and measured water levels along the flume. We compared the results to a one-dimensional model with shallow flow equations for a rough bed, which was tested on the experiments and applied to a range of length scales bridging small experiments and large estuaries. We found that the Reynolds method results in negligible flows along the flume except for the first few metres, whereas flume tilting results in nearly uniform reversing flow velocities along the entire flume that are strong enough to move sand. Furthermore, tidal excursion length relative to basin length and the dominance of friction over inertia is similar in tidal experiments and reality. The sediment mobility converges between the Reynolds method and tilting for flumes hundreds of metres long, which is impractical. Smaller flumes of a few metres in length, on the other hand, are much more dominated by friction than natural systems, meaning that sediment suspension would be impossible in the resulting laminar flow on tidal flats. Where the Reynolds method is limited by small sediment mobility and high tidal range relative to water depth, the tilting method allows for independent control over the variables flow depth, velocity, sediment mobility, tidal period and excursion length, and tidal asymmetry. A periodically tilting flume thus opens up the possibility of systematic biogeomorphological experimentation with self-formed estuaries...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} soil hydraulic properties of a weathered tropical soil (Oxisol) using a medium-sized column with undisturbed soil is presented. The method {{was used to}} determine fitting parameters of the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity functions of a soil column in support of a pesticide leaching study. The soil column was extracted from a continuously-used research plot in Central Oahu (Hawaii, USA) and its internal structure was examined by computed tomography. The experiment was based on tension infiltration into the soil column with <b>free</b> <b>outflow</b> at the lower end. Water flow through the soil core was mathematically modeled using a computer code that numerically solves the one-dimensional Richards equation. Measured soil hydraulic parameters were used for direct simulation, and the retention and soil hydraulic parameters were estimated by inverse modeling. The inverse modeling produced very good agreement between model outputs and measured flux and pressure head data for the relatively homogeneous column. The moisture content at a given pressure from the retention curve measured directly in small soil samples was lower than that obtained through parameter optimization based on experiments using a medium-sized undisturbed soil column...|$|E
40|$|In the paper, the {{phenomenon}} of hysteresis which can develop in a supercritical channel flow approaching an obstacle is analyzed, and a simple theory to predict the occurrence of hysteresis is described. The results of an in-depth theoretical and experimental study of the case of flow under a vertical sluice gate in a rectangular channel are then presented. Possible flow regimes {{in the vicinity of}} a gate are classified {{on the basis of the}} nondimensional gate opening and the Froude number of the undisturbed approaching flow. It is shown that within a wide range of flow parameters both undisturbed and <b>free</b> <b>outflow</b> conditions may exist for the same gate opening. Within this range, the actual regime depends on the previous history of the flow, thus implying the hysteretic character of the flow. It is worth noting that a subcritical approaching flow may also exhibit such a hysteretic behavior provided the Froude number is greater than approximately 0. 8. This occurrence, which has not previously been reported in the literature, is probably a result of the contraction affecting the flow issuing from under the gate. The results of an extensive series of experiments, performed over a wide range of flow parameters, are detailed in the paper and confirm theoretical predictions...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of circumbinary disks under the gravitational influence of the binary using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the impact of disk and binary parameters on the dynamical aspects of the disk. To distinguish between physical and numerical effects we apply three hydrodynamical codes. First we analyse in detail numerical issues concerning the conditions at the boundaries and grid resolution. We then perform a series of simulations with different binary (eccentricity, mass ratio) and disk parameters (viscosity, aspect ratio) starting from a reference model with Kepler- 16 parameters. Concerning the numerical aspects {{we find that the}} inner grid radius must be of the order of the binary semi-major axis, with <b>free</b> <b>outflow</b> conditions applied such that mass can flow onto the central binary. A closed inner boundary leads to unstable evolutions. We find that the inner disk turns eccentric and precesses for all investigated physical parameters. The precession rate is slow with periods (T_prec) starting at around 500 binary orbits (T_bin) for high viscosity and large H/R where the inner hole is smaller and more circular. Reducing α and H/R increases the gap size and T_prec reaches 2500 T_bin. For varying binary mass ratios q_bin the gap size remains constant whereas T_prec decreases for increasing q_bin. For varying binary eccentricities e_bin we find two separate branches in the gap size and eccentricity diagram. The bifurcation occurs at around e_crit≈ 0. 18 where the gap is smallest with the shortest T_prec. For e_bin smaller and larger than e_crit the gap size and T_prec increase. Circular binaries create the most eccentric disks. Comment: 20 pages, 25 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|E
40|$|Metal {{composites}} {{are ever}} more readily used as structural materials, {{due to their}} properties. Therefore, {{in spite of their}} difficult processing, their use constantly grows (e. g. SGL Carbon Poland S. A.). In consequence, the amount of their wastes grows too. Since the social pressure aimed at improving the quality of environment has recently intensified and the significance of the technologies enabling recovery of secondary materials has increased, the interest in recycling of metal composites also grew, irrespective of all the difficulties related thereto. One of the groups of metal composites includes the composites with saturated reinforcement. They may be recycled only with the method of components separation. The simplest way for this consists in choosing an appropriate environment in which the recycling occurs so as to enable <b>free</b> <b>outflow</b> of melted matrix from capillaries of the porous reinforcing profile. As an effectiveness measure of the process not only the yield of the melted metal but also its quality should be considered. The paper presents results of the studies on recycling of a group of composite materials with saturated reinforcement of various structures and chemical compositions. The environments including salt mixtures chosen for the considered composites reinforced with pressed fibre profiles satisfy the first and the most important quantity criterion. i. e. allow for achieving the required metal yield. For the composite of the highest yield level the quality of melted metal was analyzed which showed that the environment selected this way meets also another criterion that enables obtaining high quality alloys, thus allowing for their direct use in the process of reinforcing the composite casts. On the other hand, {{in the case of the}} composites reinforced with sinters the first criterion has not been met and, therefore, the metal quality in this case has not been assessed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} various {{magnitudes}} of gravitational {{force on the}} natural flickering frequency and the emission indexes of NO{sub x} and CO of an unsteady laminar methane diffusion flame are investigated numerically. This is done by solving the low Mach number formulation of the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations. A staggered mesh in cylindrical coordinates with a numerical algorithm that is accurate to second order in both time and space is used. <b>Free</b> <b>outflow</b> boundary conditions that allow mass to enter or exit the computational domain are employed in this study. This allows {{the placement of the}} outer boundary of the computational domain close to the region of interest. For a given number of grid points, it is then more computationally efficient to utilize a relatively fine grid, which reduces numerical dissipation to a minimum. In order to solve this elliptic time-dependent reacting flow problem rapidly, the complex chemical mechanism is simplified by using the concept of a flamelet model originally developed for non-premixed turbulent combustion. By using a flamelet library, the solution of only one additional transport equation, that for the mixture fraction, is required. This enables us to avoid solving the energy and species equations, which would necessitate the resolution of chemical time and spatial scales that are much smaller than the characteristic fluid time scale. The first five seconds of the formation of a diffusion flame under various gravitational constants is simulated in this study. Following the approach used by other researchers, linear stability analysis is applied to gain insight into the physical nature of the flickering behavior. Instantaneous and time-averaged emission indexes (EI) of NO{sub x} and CO are determined at the exit plane of the computational domain. It is found that as the gravitational forces increase, the mean NO{sub x} emission index decreases, while that for CO increases...|$|E
