500|$|Despite his almost {{complete}} lack of musical training, and taking inspiration from what little Western music he had heard, Takemitsu began to compose in earnest {{at the age of}} 16: [...] "... I began [...] music attracted to music itself as one human being. Being in music <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>my</b> raison d'être as a man. After the war, music was the only thing. Choosing to be in music clarified my identity." [...] Though he studied briefly with Yasuji Kiyose beginning in 1948, Takemitsu remained largely self-taught throughout his musical career.|$|E
500|$|In November 2001, {{she became}} the first person other than a {{president}} to deliver the weekly presidential radio address. She used the opportunity to discuss the plight of women in Afghanistan leading up to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, saying, [...] "The brutal oppression of women is a central goal of the terrorists." [...] Her husband was originally to give the address but he felt that she should do it; she later recalled, [...] "At that moment, it was not that <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>my</b> voice. Instead, it was as if my voice found me." [...] Her words summarized one of the goals and moral rationales of the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and it became one of the more famous speeches of his administration. In May 2002, she made a speech to the people of Afghanistan through Radio Liberty. [...] In March 2005, she made the first of three trips to that country as First Lady.|$|E
500|$|Under his {{new stage}} name, LL Cool J (an acronym for Ladies Love Cool James), Smith {{was signed by}} Def Jam, {{which led to the}} release of his first {{official}} record, the 12-inch single [...] "I Need a Beat" [...] (1984). The single was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes. Smith later discussed his search for a label, stating [...] "I sent my demo to many different companies, but it was Def Jam where <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>my</b> home." [...] That same year, Smith made his professional debut concert performance at Manhattan Center High School. In a later interview, LL Cool J recalled the experience, stating [...] "They pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my DJ, Cut Creator, started playing.... As soon as it was over there were girls screaming and asking for autographs. Right then and there I said 'This is what I want to do'." [...] LL's debut single sold over 100,000 copies and helped establish both Def Jam as a label and Smith as a rapper. The commercial success of [...] "I Need a Beat", along with the Beastie Boys' single [...] "Rock Hard" [...] (1984), helped lead Def Jam to a distribution deal with Columbia Records the following year.|$|E

500|$|The transfer, in 2007, {{coincided with}} an upturn in Ebsary's career. After {{a slow start}} in the new WNCL season—Western Australia lost their first five matches—Ebsary became more productive. She scored 30 of 141 and took 1/16 in a low-scoring win over New South Wales in the sixth match. In the last double-header of the season, against Queensland, she made {{consecutive}} half-centuries {{for the first time}} in her career. In the first match she made 72 before taking 4/46 to help secure a 104-run win, before scoring 62 the next day to lay the foundation for a five-wicket win. Ebsary scored 236 runs at 29.50; her previous best WNCL aggregate was 149. However, she did have trouble in running between the wickets; three of her eight dismissals were run outs. She took eight wickets at 33.87 at an economy rate of 4.43 and had a workload more than 50% heavier than in previous seasons. Ebsary was not as successful in the fledgling Twenty20 format; in two matches for the season, her first in the most abbreviated form of cricket, she scored 33 runs at 16.50 and conceded 51 runs at an economy rate of 7.46 without taking a wicket. Ebsary later said [...] "Looking back, the move to the West has been the best thing for my cricket...After settling our line-up, it gave me a chance to let loose at the top of the order and helped my confidence to be aggressive at the batting crease...Under the leadership of Avril Fahey, the West Aussies were very welcoming and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>my</b> groove at the top of the order." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1958 {{the first}} major U.S. {{exhibition}} of his work {{was held at the}} Zoë Dusanne Gallery in Seattle. Traveling home to participate proved revelatory to Koenig: [...] "I saw the West again. Here was all this space and light you couldn't see in Europe.

2500|$|However, he {{very quickly}} {{noticed that a}} burgeoning folk scene was emerging, {{centered}} around the Baggot StreetMerrion quarter of Dublin's city centre. [...] "As soon as <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>my</b> feet there, I thought, 'That's it, goodbye acting!'". After discovering Irish music through Séamus Ennis on Peter Kennedy's BBC programme As I Roved Out and through Ciarán Mac Mathúna on Raidió Éireann, Irvine studiously spent many hours at the National Library, scouring old songbooks like the Child Ballads and Sam Henry's Songs of the People, as well as A.L. Lloyd's Penguin Book of English Folk Songs. He also drew inspiration from Ewan MacColl, notably the songs he wrote for his radio-ballads.|$|E
2500|$|In the meantime, the {{government}} {{put in place}} a [...] "militia" [...] of special constables called the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies (OMS) of volunteers to maintain order in the street. A special constable said: [...] "It was not difficult to understand the strikers' attitude toward us. After a few days <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>my</b> sympathy with them rather than with the employers. For one thing, I had never realized the appalling poverty which existed. If I had been aware of all the facts, I should not have joined up as a special constable". It was decided that Fascists {{would not be allowed to}} enlist in the OMS without first giving up their political beliefs, as {{the government}} feared a right-wing backlash so the fascists formed the so-called [...] "Q Division" [...] under Rotha Lintorn-Orman to combat the strikers.|$|E

2500|$|Kertész {{was born}} in Budapest, Hungary, in 1929, the first child of Margit Muresian and Miklós Kertész. His sister, Vera, was born four years later. Miklós Kertész, born in Szécsény, Hungary into a large Jewish family, was the {{director}} of a leather-works and died of appendicitis in 1938. An energetic, intellectually gifted woman, Margit Muresian Kertész went to work to support her family. Despite strictures against women working professionally in Hungarian society {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, Margit was steadily promoted until she ran the office where she was employed. At an early age Kertész showed a great affinity for music, and began violin lessons. [...] "When I was six and started music," [...] he told a High Fidelity interviewer, [...] "it was 1935 and cruel things were going on in Europe [...] [...] [...] <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>my</b> `exile' in music, practicing the piano, the fiddle, and writing little compositions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor Dayne was {{a singer}} for a musical {{piece in the}} film, and Joey Travolta and Jeff Lass served as songwriters. The film was narrated by Graham Nash. The film's {{production}} company was Normal Films. Joey Travolta first met Cross at a program Travolta led teaching the art of filmmaking to children with special needs. Travolta, an autism activist, helped educate Cross about filmmaking, and assisted him in getting his message out to a wider audience. Joey Travolta is a former special education teacher, {{and at the time}} of the film's production operated a children's film and acting workshop called Entertainment Experience. [...] "So I mentored him with lights and the camera and editing. He did all the interviewing and research. I kind of worked one-on-one with him," [...] said Travolta of his work with Taylor Cross. Joey Travolta started the organization Actors for Autism, which assists those with the condition to create films. [...] "I dedicated my life to this. I love working with kids and I love making films," [...] said Travolta to The Bakersfield Californian. Travolta commented on the impact of the film: [...] "It was like a domino effect. And <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>my</b> calling." [...] After his experiences working on the film, Travolta began to teach film to autistic children at camps in California, Florida, and Michigan.|$|E
2500|$|The year 1913 was for Bourguiba an {{important}} one: Working harder on his studies, he obtained his Certificat d'études primaires which dispensed him of military servitude {{by order of}} a beylical decree and to the grand relief of his father. Not only did his son avoid his fate just like his other sons, {{but he was also}} permitted to pursue his education in the Sadiki College, receiving financial coverage for his studies, which included [...] "shelter, food, clothing, school supplies and even free hammam every 15 days for six years" [...] until he graduated. However, his joy did not last: On October 1, he went back to Tunis in order to start the year in Sadiki College but {{during the first week of}} November 1913, [...] "the superintendent called me out of class and announced me the death of my mother", Bourguiba stated in 1973. [...] "I immediately returned to Monastir where <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>my</b> whole family surrounding my mother lying on the deathbed [...] The death of my mother had deeply shaken me. I was indelibly marked". As for him, no other event has been rougher that his mother's death: Neither his future remoteness in Bordj le Bœuf years later, nor his imprisonment in the Fort Saint-Nicolas in Marseille nor even his exile in Cairo. He stated that he had at least made her proud by obtaining his certificat d'étude primaire.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2011, Crabapple {{was living}} in a studio near Zuccotti Park. [...] Occupy Wall Street protesters had begun to use the Park as a camp to stage their movement, artists began {{creating}} posters and Crabapple decided to contribute work and engage in the movement. [...] "Before Occupy I felt like using my art for activist causes was exploitive of activist causes," [...] she told the Village Voice. [...] "I think what Occupy let me do was it allowed me to instead of just donating money to politics or just going to marches, it allowed me to engage my art in politics." [...] Artists and journalists who had {{come from all over the}} world to report on the protests were using Crabapple's apartment as an [...] "impromptu salon" [...] for the Occupy movement. In Discordia (2012), British journalist Laurie Penny remembered how [...] "Occupy Wall Street had set up camp two streets away from Crabapple's apartment in Manhattan and we'd just spent a sleepless week documenting arrests. [...] Molly perched at her desk churning out protest posters and handing them to activists to copy and wheat-paste all over the financial district...After three days, the word went out that there was an apartment near the protest camp where you could find hot drinks, basic medical attention and a place to charge your gadgets and file copy. The flat became a temporary sanctuary for stray activists and journalists" [...] "I started doing protest posters," [...] Crabapple recalled. [...] "And in doing these, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>my</b> voice." [...] Author Matt Taibbi called Crabapple [...] "Occupy's greatest artist", [...] noting the use of the [...] "vampire squid" [...] theme in her Occupy artwork. [...] Crabapple, a fan of Taibbi's writing, had read his 2009 Rolling Stone article, [...] "The Great American Bubble Machine". [...] In the article, Taibbi referred to Goldman Sachs as [...] "a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money." [...] When Crabapple used Taibbi's metaphor as a stencil depicting a vampire squid and released it for anyone to use, it went viral throughout the Occupy movement.|$|E
