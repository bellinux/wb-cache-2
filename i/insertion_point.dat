25|$|However, {{given the}} very real {{possibility}} of a limp, constant and/or debilitating pain, complicated treatment and impaired mobility later in life, careful developmental monitoring is indicated and early intervention is often the result. The worst possible consequence of non treatment is developing early arthritis, sometimes even during teenage years. All treatment aims to delay the onset of arthritis, but no treatment is fully successful in avoiding it; and, all available treatments bear the risk of inflicting equivalent damage. Most unfortunately, studies have as yet {{been unable to find}} a method of predicting outcomes in either the surgical/orthopedic treatment of the condition in infants and young children, or the surgical treatment of these early treatments' negative outcomes later in life (such as arthritis, avascular necrosis, trochanteric bursitis, and bone spurs of up to 2cm just medial of the gluteus maximus <b>insertion</b> <b>point</b> on the greater trochanter due to excessive friction).|$|E
25|$|Not until 1927 {{were there}} once again plans for {{conversion}} to electric operations. Now, however, high tension alternating current, at a frequency of 16 Hz, {{was to be}} used. This offered, amongst other things, the advantage of requiring only one electrical <b>insertion</b> <b>point,</b> near Visp, which would drastically reduce the costs of electrical systems {{in comparison with the}} original plans. Consideration was also given to adopting completely the SBB current system at 15,000 volts without alteration, but that idea quickly had to be abandoned. In particular, the Rhätische Bahn, which since 1913 had been operating electric traffic at 11,000 volts AC on the Engadine Line, stressed the benefits of using lower voltage than the SBB voltage. Whereas light weight air cooled transformers could be used on the Engadine Line, a heavy oil cooling system would be necessary for 15,000 volt operations, and that would greatly have increased the weight of the VZ locomotives. Additionally, the use of a single phase current system would make problem free through traffic possible in the event of electrification of the Furka Oberalp Bahn. These advantages led to the decision to use a voltage of 11,000 volts also on the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn.|$|E
25|$|During the Paitilla Airfield operation, another Navy SEAL group, {{consisting}} of four divers and men on Zodiac attack boats, {{was assigned to}} sabotage Noriega's heavily armed gunboat, Presidente Porras, while it was tied to a pier on the canal. The plan called for the divers to plant explosives {{on the bottom of}} the boat, using Draeger rebreathers, which do not give off exhalation bubbles, for added secrecy. The divers were transported by several combat rubber raiding craft to an <b>insertion</b> <b>point</b> located in a grove of mangrove trees roughly one hundred fifty yards away from the target. The divers entered the water and approached the boat in separate pairs, attached the explosives, and began exfiltrating. As they were leaving, several PDF guards began dropping grenades and shooting into the water, forcing the SEALs to take cover under the pier. Due to this diversion, the divers were still in the area when the bombs went off, and were able to confirm that the ship was destroyed. As the divers were heading back to the rendezvous point, they heard a large ship approaching overhead, and were forced to descend to forty feet, dangerous due to the increased toxicity of the pure oxygen used in the Draeger at greater pressures. However, no divers experienced any ill effects, and both pairs were picked up by several raiding craft, and were transported back to Rodman Naval Base.|$|E

500|$|Day of Defeat: Source {{is set in}} World War II, {{specifically}} the European Theatre in 1944. Players join the forces of either the United States Army or the German Wehrmacht and compete {{against each other in}} a variety of game modes. Players select from one of six classes to play as, each with its own role within the team. Player characters cannot take much damage, and in some circumstances can be killed by a single bullet, forcing players to make use of cover to stay alive.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop an algorithm for automated generation of non-penetrating strings between <b>insertion</b> <b>points</b> and to evaluate its feasibility for estimating length changes of the medial patellofemoral ligament during normal knee flexion. Three-dimensional knee models were generated from computed tomography (CT) scans of 10 healthy subjects. The knee joint under weight-bearing was acquired in four flexion positions (0 °- 120 °). The path between <b>insertion</b> <b>points</b> was computed in each position to quantify string length and isometry. The average string length was maximal in 0 ° of flexion (64. 5  ±  3. 9  mm between femoral and proximal patellar point; 62. 8  ±  4. 0  mm between femoral and distal patellar point). It was minimal in 30 ° (60. 0  ±  2. 6  mm) for the proximal patellar string and in 120 ° (58. 7  ±  4. 3  mm) for the distal patellar string. The <b>insertion</b> <b>points</b> were considered to be isometric in 4 of the 10 subjects. The proposed algorithm appears to be feasible for estimating string lengths between <b>insertion</b> <b>points</b> in an automatic fashion. The length measurements based on CT images acquired under physiological loading conditions may give further insights into knee kinematics...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Speech {{segmentation}} is {{an important}} part for speech recognition, synthesizing and coding. Statistical based approach detects segmentation points via computing spectral distortion of the signal without prior knowledge of the acoustic information proved {{to be able to give}} good match, less omission but lot of <b>insertion.</b> These <b>insertion</b> <b>points</b> dropped segmentation accuracy. Approach: This study proposed a fusion method between statistical and connectionist approaches namely the divergence algorithm and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) with adaptive learning for segmentation of Malay connected digit with the aim to improve statistical approach via detection of <b>insertion</b> <b>points.</b> The neural network was optimized via trial and error in finding suitable parameters and speech time normalization methods. The best neural network classifier was then fusion with divergence algorithm to make segmentation. Results: The results of the experiments showed that the best neural network classifier used learning rate of value 1. 0 and momentum rate of value 0. 9 with data normalization based on zero-padded. The segmentation using fusion of statistical and connectionist was able to reduce <b>insertion</b> <b>points</b> up to 10. 4 % while maintaining match points above 99 % and omission point below 0. 7 % within time tolerance of 0. 09 second.

2500|$|Despite these improvements, Word 2013 {{stopped using}} ClearType. The reasons invoked are, {{in the words}} of Murray Sargent: [...] "There is a problem with ClearType: it depends {{critically}} on the color of the background pixels. This isn’t a problem if you know a priori that those pixels are white, which is usually the case for text. But the general case involves calculating what the colors should be for an arbitrary background and that takes time. Meanwhile, Word 2013 enjoys cool animations and smooth zooming. Nothing jumps any more. Even the caret (the blinking vertical line at the text <b>insertion</b> <b>point)</b> glides from one position to the next as you type. Jerking movement just isn’t considered cool any more. Well animations and zooms have to be faster than human response times in order to appear smooth. And that rules out ClearType in animated scenarios at least with present generation hardware. And in future scenarios, screens will have sufficiently high resolution that gray-scale anti-aliasing should suffice." ...|$|E
2500|$|GMV {{is meant}} to be light and fast and deliver {{soldiers}} from a drop zone far from enemy air defenses or indirect fire systems. Five vehicles would carry a platoon headquarters, three rifle squads, and a weapons squad. The vehicle is seen as a [...] "21st century jeep" [...] to move troops around during an initial attack faster than the enemy can counter them with heavy weapons. Both the GMV and LRV are to replace sling-loaded Humvees in this role (but not for other units). Interest in the effort is expected on the scale of the U.S. Special Operations Command program to replace the Ground Mobility Vehicle, which also sought to replace a Humvee-based vehicle with a lighter and more air-mobile design. Airborne infantry brigades would use the vehicles to rush forces from their airborne <b>insertion</b> <b>point</b> to seize an objective, which would become a forward airfield for reinforcing and deploying heavier follow-on forces.
