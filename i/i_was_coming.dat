5|$|Despite {{being located}} in remote Scapa Flow, Battleship Division Nine {{was unable to}} avoid a global killer that struck just as World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> to a close. Spanish Influenza—which killed {{millions}} worldwide in 1918–1919—did not spare the Grand Fleet. By late fall, an average of seven men per day were dying of the virus throughout the Fleet, and some ships were so badly affected that they were practically unmanageable. Though they were not as badly hit {{as some of the}} British vessels, the American battleships were not immune. By early November, only Florida was not in quarantine, and Arkansas had 259 cases, with 11 deaths.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

Is it because I'm the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree that I was smarter than the rest?" ...|$|E

All right, don't remonstrate, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>coming</b> over to lunch--I can't hear you--never mind what people will say. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>coming</b> over to lunch at one o'clock, mind you <b>are</b> in.

500|$|In {{the final}} minute of play, with Phil Esposito, Yvan Cournoyer and Peter Mahovlich out on the ice, Paul Henderson stood up at the bench and called Mahovlich off the ice as he was skating by. [...] "I jumped {{on the ice and}} rushed {{straight}} for their net. I had this strange feeling that I could score the winning goal", recalls Henderson. Bobby Clarke was supposed to replace Esposito, but Phil didn't come off ("There was no way <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> off the ice in that situation" [...] Esposito said). Cournoyer picked up a puck that had been passed around the boards by the Soviets in a clearing attempt. He missed Henderson with a pass, but two Soviets mishandled the puck in the corner and Esposito shot the puck on Tretiak.|$|E
500|$|Smith had {{attempted}} to go to rehab several times, but {{found that he was}} unable to relate to the popular treatments for addicts that used a twelve-step program basis for treatment. [...] "I couldn't do the first step [...] I couldn't say what you were supposed to say and mean it." [...] In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center, [...] "What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you're on a drip bag, but the only thing that's in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I'm not psychotic." ...|$|E

He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{becoming}} {{a model to}} support her acting career, Guillory waited tables at a club. In an interview in 2000, she said about the experience [...] "Supporting my acting habit with waitressing {{was probably the most}} useful thing I've done." [...] During her time as a model, she studied acting at the New World School of the Arts and the Paris Conservatoire, also taking small television and film roles in The Future Lasts a Long Time (1996), The Rules of Engagement (1999), Star! Star! (1999), Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang) (2000), The 3 Kings (2000), and Two Days, Nine Lives (2000). During this time, Guillory decided to go on with her acting career because [...] "I was so scared of going to university and being with people my own age again, having been with that tiny little sect of girls in Norfolk whose daddies were farmers and politicians, who didn't trust me and didn't know where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> from".|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Keri {{confirmed}} a clean {{version of}} the song would be included on her album. Some lyrical modifications were made. The line [...] "I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] was replaced by [...] "I got the kind of lovin' that'll keep you out the streets", and the word [...] "fuck" [...] was replaced with the word [...] "thug", while in others it was removed altogether. Ross told Jason Rodriguez of MTV News: [...] "When I got the record, I most definitely {{knew she was going}} to another level and I was excited for [...] I love to see the creative side. She's a sexy female and I think she showed that. When I think of Janet Jackson when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> up and she was doing her Control thing, I loved it. So if that's the feeling that young people [...] or whoever is feeling the music, if that's the inspiration they get, I think it's dope." ...|$|E
500|$|On 25 November 2012, Debbie Schipp {{from the}} Herald Sun {{reported}} that Anderson {{would return to}} Home and Away in December to shoot [...] "a handful of episodes" [...] to be broadcast during the following year. Schipp revealed that there was [...] "intense speculation" [...] about how the writers would get around the fact that Charlie died on-screen in January. Of her return, Anderson explained [...] "I told my mum and dad that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> back, and they almost fell off their chairs. They said: 'Hang on, didn't Charlie die?' It's hilarious, because this time twelve months ago I was keeping it the biggest secret from everyone as to whether Charlie would live or die, and now I'm {{in the same boat}} again as far as not giving anything away." [...] The actress added that the return storyline was outlined {{a couple of months ago}} and she just knew that she wanted to do it. Charlie returned on 17 June 2013.|$|E

500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the album}} Untouchables leaking onto the Internet, Take a Look in the Mirror was {{released}} on a Friday, November 21, 2003 – four days earlier than its original release date. The album therefore received a weekend's worth of sales, {{which resulted in a}} poor showing on the Billboard 200. During its first full week, Take a Look in the Mirror soared ten places from number nineteen to number nine, increasing the album's total sales to 179,000. It is the first album self-produced by Korn. The band explained that they wanted fans to hear the music as it should be. The album presented different styles and themes compared to previous albums. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis related: [...] "The whole album is about love, hate and my hate of people and just losing my mind. The previous albums I did, I think the last three, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> from a place of hurt. And I just finally {{got to the point where}} I'm done hurting and I'm just pissed off about it now. It's turned back to just sheer hate and anger. And it definitely comes across on the album." [...] MTV News said that Davis convinced his fans that they [...] "will be shocked, particularly with the album's second track, 'Break Some Off,' which he called 'brutal'." [...] Korn released the single [...] "Did My Time" [...] on July 22, 2003, which was used to promote the film but did not appear on the soundtrack to [...] due to unspecified legal issues. The single debuted and peaked at number thirty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Korn's first and only top-forty hit in the United States. [...] "Did My Time" [...] gave Korn another Grammy nomination in the Best Metal Performance category.|$|E

He took the first four wickets to fall as the England side held on for a draw.

And, I thought, I knew Jimmy , I {{knew he was a}} like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things.

Several singles and three albums as The JAMs followed (their debut, 1987; the follow-up, Who Killed The JAMs?; and compilation Shag Times) before a change of direction saw the duo mutate into dance and ambient music pioneers, The KLF. Along the way, the duo scored their first British number one hit single as The Timelords with the Gary Glitter/Dr. Who novelty-pop mash-up [...] "Doctorin' the Tardis", claimed to be sung by Cauty's 1968 Ford Galaxie American police car.|$|E
