25|$|The {{majority}} of Crawley buses feature a light blue base {{with a dark}} blue roof which swoops down at the front. It also has a white stripe separating the roof from the base, and a light blue lower <b>dash</b> <b>panel.</b> The Fastway livery is a silver base with navy blue cantrail panels and a navy blue lower front panel. Some older buses feature light blue with a dark blue roof and skirt panels along with a dark blue lower <b>dash</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
25|$|For the 1990 model year, changes {{included}} larger protective laminate {{in front}} of rear wheels, lower redline (owing to the heavier crank with cylinders 2 & 5 counterbalanced), redesigned steering wheel with cruise control relocated to a stalk on the right side. In addition to an airbag and airbag indicator light on dash, {{there was also a}} redesign of the left side switch panel, which replaced one of the coin slots with the dimmer. Lower <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> became a two piece design, which was also much heavier than the previous one piece panel owing to a change in material. Finally the memory lever on the steering column was removed.|$|E
25|$|The Venturer II had {{a common}} front profile for all models, {{together}} with a standard <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> featuring a four-part radiator grille with a central cross within an oval outline which also embraced the headlamps. A rear-end revision marked {{the launch of the}} Venturer III in 1954, and the following year a version was produced for underfloor-engined chassis with the entrance ahead of the front axle. This required a return to a more vertical front profile, and meant that there were now three variants of the Venturer – front engined, underfloor-engined with a centre entrance and underfloor-engined with a front entrance. This three-variant approach, established with the Venturer, continued throughout the life of the succeeding Consort model and into the Embassy era, although the relative importance of the three versions varied significantly over the years.|$|E
5000|$|These four-wheeled, {{double-deck}} tramcars {{were the}} mainstay of the Glasgow tram fleet from electrification until the late 1950s (only being withdrawn due to the imminent closure of the system). Over 1000 were built between 1898 and 1924. They were progressively modernised in four phases, although not all went through each phase. The first cars were open-top unvestibuled four-wheelers (phase one). They then received top covers with open balconies (phase two), platform vestibules and roll-top draught covers (phase three) and finally fully enclosed top covers (phase four). Electrical equipment and running gear was also upgraded at each modernisation phase. The earlier cars had rounded front <b>dash</b> <b>panels,</b> but later cars which were built with vestibule glazing from new had hexagonal profile <b>dash</b> <b>panels.</b> When early cars were upgraded to receive vestibule glazing they retained their round <b>dash</b> <b>panels,</b> and latterly the main visual difference within the fleet was between the [...] "round dash" [...] and [...] "hex dash" [...] variants. A few cars were also cut down to single deckers for use on the Clydebank - Duntocher route which passed under low railway bridges.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{features a}} new grille, front bumper, headlamps, taillights, rear bumper and new wheel covers. The interior sports {{a more modern}} look as well as better visibility and usability, new instrument cluster design and metallic-finish <b>dash</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} was revised {{with a new}} center console, lower <b>dash</b> <b>panels</b> (to meet U.S. regulations) and a single monopod gauge cluster (with electronic gauges). For the North American market a model dubbed the Graduate was added in tribute to the car's famous appearance in the 1967 film, The Graduate, starring Dustin Hoffman.|$|R
500|$|Nissan's Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians is a sine-wave {{sound system}} that sweeps from 2.5 kHz {{at the high}} end to a low of 600 Hz, a range that is easily audible across age groups. Depending on the speed and whether the Leaf is {{accelerating}} or decelerating, the sound system will make sweeping, high-low sounds. For example, when the Leaf is started the sound will be louder, and when the car is in reverse, the system will generate an intermittent sound. The sound system ceases operation when the Nissan Leaf reaches [...] and engages again as the car slows to under [...] For the 2011 Leaf, the driver could turn off sounds temporarily through a switch inside the vehicle, but the system automatically reset to [...] "On" [...] at the next ignition cycle. The system is controlled through a computer and synthesizer in the <b>dash</b> <b>panel,</b> and the sound is delivered through a speaker in the front driver's side wheel well. [...] Nissan said that there were six or seven finalist sounds, and that sound testing included driving cars emitting various sounds past testers standing on street corners, who indicated when they first heard the approaching car. Nissan removed the ability to disable the pedestrian alert between model year 2011 and 2012 in anticipation of the U.S. ruling to be issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.|$|E
2500|$|... 1977 {{model year}} minor changes [...] {{included}} {{a more modern}} round gauge cluster to replace the long sweeping speedometer, and a revised <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> which changed to a flatter design. [...] Some new colors were offered (as {{with the rest of}} the divisions) and some small trim added. A separate brochure was printed for the Concours while the [...] "1977 Nova" [...] brochure detailed only base and Custom versions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{air-cooled}} Villiers 10D [...] engine had a {{unit construction}} three-speed manual gearbox without reverse. This had an output of [...] at 4,400rpm which the manufacturers claimed gave a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton unladen. The engine unit sat in an alloy cradle {{ahead of the}} front wheel, together forming part of its support. Both front wheel and engine were sprung {{as part of the}} trailing link front suspension system, which was fitted with a single coil spring and an Andre Hartford friction damper. The rear wheels were rigidly mounted to the body on stub axles with suspension provided by low pressure [...] "balloon" [...] type tyres. Starting was achieved by using a pull handle mounted under the <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> and connected by cable to a modified kick-start lever on the engine. The steering comprised a system of pulleys and a cable usually referred to as [...] "bobbin and cable", connecting a conventional steering wheel to the front steering unit. The bobbin and cable steering arrangement was replaced by a rack and pinion system in October 1950. Brakes were provided on only the rear wheels; they were conventional drum brakes operated by a system of cables and rods.|$|E
2500|$|... 1997 – Manual {{transmission}} {{available on}} turbo models. Restyled front bumper and grey (instead of black) taillight surrounds. Restyled headlights, now black {{on the inside}} with chrome rings (all chrome previously) and a clearer lens. All 1997 labeled as 15th Anniversary model. New grey <b>dash</b> <b>panels</b> to replace the previous black. Japanese production stopped in September.|$|R

50|$|Thermoforming {{differs from}} {{injection}} molding, blow molding, rotational molding {{and other forms}} of processing plastics. Thin-gauge thermoforming is primarily the manufacture of disposable cups, containers, lids, trays, blisters, clamshells, and other products for the food, medical, and general retail industries. Thick-gauge thermoforming includes parts as diverse as vehicle door and <b>dash</b> <b>panels,</b> refrigerator liners, utility vehicle beds, and plastic pallets.|$|R
2500|$|Due to {{significant}} noise reduction typical of electric vehicles that travel at low speeds, the 2011 Leaf includes digital warning sounds, one for forward motion {{and another for}} reverse, to alert pedestrians, the blind, and others of its presence. For this purpose Nissan created the Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians (VSP) system, which was also used in Nissan Fuga hybrid. The system developed makes a noise easy to hear for those outside {{in order to be}} aware of the vehicle approaching, but the warning sounds do not distract the car occupants inside. Nissan explained that during the development of the sound, they studied behavioral research of the visually impaired and worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists. The sine-wave sound system sweeps from 2.5kHz at the high end to a low of 600Hz, an easily audible range across age groups. Depending on the speed and if the Leaf is accelerating or decelerating, the sound system makes sweeping, high-low sounds. The sound system ceases operation when the Nissan Leaf reaches [...] and engages again as car slows to under [...] For the 2011 model, the driver could turn off sounds temporarily through a switch inside the vehicle, but the system automatically reset to [...] "On" [...] at the next ignition cycle. The system is controlled through a computer and synthesizer in the <b>dash</b> <b>panel,</b> and the sound is delivered through a speaker in the front driver’s side wheel well. Nissan removed the ability to disable the pedestrian alert between model year 2011 and 2012 in anticipation of the U.S. ruling to be issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} has MG Metro {{front seats}} trimmed in Connolly Leather hide, VDO instruments in an ERA-designed <b>dash</b> <b>panel,</b> pile carpeting, and a sunroof.|$|E
50|$|Southdown {{specified}} the <b>dash</b> <b>panels</b> of the Cavalier {{on their}} batch. The return of North Western was maybe a surprise {{as they were}} a major supporter of the 11m Alexander Y type, but they obviously wanted something shorter (and a bit classier) for their extended tours, their two Leopard L2 had illuminated offside and nearside name badges under the second bay.|$|R
25|$|The Nash Ambassador and Statesman {{continued}} with overhead- valve and L-head sixes respectively. Hudson and Nash cars had different front suspensions. Trunk lids were interchangeable but other body panels, rear window glass, <b>dash</b> <b>panels</b> and braking systems were different. The Hudson Hornet and Wasp, and their Nash counterparts, had improved ride and visibility; also better fuel economy {{owing to the}} lighter unitized Nash body.|$|R
50|$|The 1964 season short Cavaliers for BET fleets Greenslades (10 Reliance) and Devon General Grey Cars (8 Reliance) were notable {{in being}} to 7 ft 6in width and having Grenadier style <b>dash</b> <b>panels.</b> Grey Green took eleven, Leopard L2, Crump of Pinner took another Reliance and Hutchings & Cornelius with one Reliance became the last new {{customer}} for the Cavalier. 31 {{of the short}} version were built in its final season.|$|R

Some older buses feature light blue with a dark blue roof and skirt panels along with a dark blue lower <b>dash</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} trim was also changed, {{with the most}} notable differences being {{the introduction of a}} separate instrument cluster, instead of the gauges installed in the <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> in earlier cars.|$|E
50|$|It began {{life as the}} Premiere 320 {{which was}} then updated to the Prima when the Premiere was {{replaced}} by the Paragon. The Prima was then modified with the Paragon lower <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> and rear panel and rechristened the Profile.|$|E
50|$|In {{an effort}} to lessen the {{perceived}} distance {{to the base of}} the windshield, a ridge was added to the interior <b>dash</b> finishing <b>panel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1979 - As for 1978 {{but with}} revised <b>dash</b> <b>panels</b> and the {{discontinuance}} of the 460 engine. To {{mark the end}} of the full-size luxury car segment through them, Lincoln introduces the [...] "Collector's Series" [...] for the Mark V coupe and Continental sedan, with many options made standard. There is information that suggests that the first 500 [...] "Collector's Series" [...] Mark V coupés were built with the 460 engine. There are certainly a few surviving examples of early cars fitted with factory 460's.|$|R
5000|$|To {{celebrate}} BMW Motorsport 20th anniversary, BMW {{had built}} 20 specially equipped Euro-spec M5s in late 1992. These, {{based on the}} 3.8 L engine were only in Mugello Red (274) and {{had a number of}} aesthetic trim upgrades such as carbon fiber <b>dash</b> <b>panels</b> and special rear view mirrors. Unique seat center & door trim fabric was matched with Alcantara. Alcantara was also used on the steering wheel, shift lever & parking brake lever. Red seatbelts with [...] "BMW Motorsport" [...] were also included.|$|R
50|$|Like later Spectras, {{the body}} is of low floor design and has the same lower <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> as the single decker Kinetec. Like the Kinetec, this bus again uses the chassis maker's (MAN's) front with the East Lancs Olympus body.|$|E
5000|$|The AD {{retained}} the new [...] "stovebolt" [...] 194 CID L six-cylinder engine from the Series AC, but with bigger intake valves and smaller exhaust valves, {{along with a}} new manifold, raised power from [...] to [...] The suspension now included hydraulic shock absorbers and the fuel gauge was moved from the tank to the <b>dash</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
50|$|A CVT was optional, and was {{available}} in a stretched-wheelbase version with seven seats, called the Cube³. With a CVT, the steering wheel button controls and the sport wheel button on the <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> are located next to the hazard flasher switch. In mid-2005, the cube had an optional upgrade with the new HR-series 1.5 L engine from the Nissan Tiida.|$|E
50|$|A {{dashboard}} (also called <b>dash,</b> instrument <b>panel</b> (IP), or fascia) is {{a control}} panel located directly {{ahead of a}} vehicle's driver, displaying instrumentation and controls for the vehicle's operation.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{the sixth}} batch of tramcars delivered. These open cars were {{purchased}} from G.F. Milnes & Co., in 1898 and only No. 24 has been lost, {{and this was}} in the 1930 fire at Laxey. Of those remaining, car 25 was stripped of her trucks and motors in 2003 and these have since been fitted to the [...] "new" [...] dedicated works car, now known as car 34. Also, car 26 has been out of service for many years, and 27 is a permanent way [...] "hack" [...] having more recently received a striped yellow and black paint scene to her <b>dash</b> <b>panels,</b> and prior to this a somewhat makeshift windscreen.|$|R
5000|$|These {{lightweight}} trailers {{were purchased}} in 1894 {{for the opening}} of the new part of the line between Groudle Glen and Laxey Station and were of lightweight construction; of the four supplied only two survive today, with 38 and 39 having been lost in the Laxey Car Sheds fire of 1930 and not replaced. Happily though No. 37 remains as part of the active fleet in particular used to accompany Car No. 2 as part of the [...] "vintage" [...] set during enthusiasts events. The other surviving member of the class, No. 36 remains in store at Homefield Bus Garage having been out of use for many years the car shed at Laxey until its roof was removed. The remaining servicable trailer carries a plain red livery and does not carry any operating titles, just the fleet number on the <b>dash</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 1996 models {{add more}} {{standard}} features to include standard air conditioning, daytime running lamps, {{and a new}} <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> featuring revised gauges with passenger-side airbag. The new base engine was a 2.4-liter four-cylinder [...] "2.4L Twin Cam" [...] that replaced the 2.3-liter Quad 4. There were little changes other than reduced trim levels and options for the final two model years.|$|E
50|$|The XK140's walnut {{dashboard}} {{was replaced}} by one trimmed in leather. On the early drophead coupés, the aluminium centre <b>dash</b> <b>panel,</b> which was discontinued after June 1958, had an X pattern engraving similar to the early 3.8 E-Type. Thinner doors gave more interior space. On the front parking lights, which were located atop the wings (fenders), a little red light reminded the driver the lights were on.|$|E
50|$|Right Hand Drive {{cars were}} {{manufactured}} in Canada for export to some {{countries such as}} Australia, UK, etc., until 1969. They used {{a version of the}} 1965 Impala <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> until 1969. Australian models were assembled in Australia from kits as this lessened tax on the cars. A similar arrangement applied in New Zealand although the bodies were supplied from Canada already welded, painted and trimmed.|$|E
50|$|The {{reworked}} interior includes {{new materials}} for the door, console and <b>dash</b> <b>panels,</b> a new steering wheel and seats, and {{a wide range of}} trim packages with both leather and cloth seating. The refreshed interior also features a new instrument cluster featuring a 7-inch (180mm) TFT (Thin Film Transistor) display. The available 8.4 inch UConnect touchscreen radio with available navigation has been revised, now including UConnect Apps. Mechanically, the 3.6L Pentastar V6 and the 5.7L/6.4L HEMI engines remained the same. All engines are now backed by the ZF 8HP 8-Speed Automatic transmissions co-produced by ZF (previously only V6 models used the ZF 8-speed). There have been revisions to the chassis components, including Electric Assist Power Steering, which replaces the previous models Electro-Hydraulic Assist Power Steering. New aluminum rear differentials now use 4 mounting bolts for rigidity. AWD is no longer available on 5.7L R/T models.|$|R
50|$|Hudson {{automobiles}} {{were more}} fully equipped than competitive makes, and all Hudson models received door arm rests, twin air-horns, ashtrays, windshield wipers, stop lights, locking glove box, sealed beam headlights, and deep pile carpeting. Commodore and Commodore Customs added foam rubber seat cushions (Hudson {{was the first}} automaker to introduce foam seat cushions), door-step courtesy lights, rear arm rest (sedans) and gold etched lettering on the <b>dash</b> board <b>panel.</b>|$|R
50|$|All models got new, flatter <b>dash</b> trim <b>panels,</b> {{black on}} the lower two trims and aluminum-look on the fancier two. Base models {{received}} the flatter stainless hubcaps, and Stepsides got new squared-off taillights with built-in backup lights and side markers, while the rear fenders were smoothed out where the old side markers were. Fuel doors were added on models equipped with a bed to hide the previously exposed fuel caps.|$|R
