5|$|Despite her {{publicity}} and popularity, Mansfield had no quality film roles after 1959. She was also unable to <b>fulfill</b> <b>a</b> third {{of her time}} contracted to Fox because of her repeated pregnancies. Fox stopped viewing her as major Hollywood star material, and started loaning her out to foreign productions {{until the end of}} her contract in 1962. She was first loaned out to English studios and then to Italian studios for a series of low-budget films, many of them obscure and some considered lost.|$|E

He initiated the Indian Placement Program, which helped many Native American students gain education in the 1960s and 1970s while they stayed with LDS foster families.|$|E

5|$|Rhinogradentia is {{a fictitious}} order of mammal invented by German {{zoologist}} Gerolf Steiner. Members of the order, known as rhinogrades or snouters, {{are characterized by}} a nose-like feature called a nasorium, which evolved to <b>fulfill</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of functions in different species. Steiner also created a fictional persona, naturalist Harald Stümpke, who is credited as author of the 1957 book Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia (translated into English in 1967 as The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades). According to Steiner, {{it is the only}} remaining record of the animals, which were wiped out, along with all the world's Rhinogradentia researchers, when the small Pacific archipelago they inhabited sank into the ocean due to nearby atomic bomb testing.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of Branham's followers {{to his death}} was one of shocking disbelief. In the confusion immediately following his death, expectations developed that he would rise from the dead. His funeral was held on December 29, 1965, but his burial was delayed indefinitely. The press surmised {{that this was a}} result of Branham's expected resurrection. He was finally buried on April 11, 1966, the day after Easter Sunday, which was accepted reluctantly by his followers.

There is also a positive statistical correlation between self-harm and emotional abuse. Self-harm may become a means of managing and controlling pain, in contrast to the pain experienced earlier in the person's life of which they had no control over (e.g., through abuse).|$|E

All of Ooo is soon engrossed in the radio broadcast, unbeknownst to Jake.|$|E
5|$|Aaron Copland wrote Connotations to <b>fulfill</b> <b>a</b> {{commission}} from Leonard Bernstein for {{the opening}} concert of the New York Philharmonic's new home in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Since this hall was slated as {{the first part of}} Lincoln Center for completion, its inauguration was considered especially momentous.

Noted composers would also attend included Samuel Barber, Henry Cowell, Roy Harris, Walter Piston, Richard Rodgers, William Schuman and Roger Sessions. United States President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie had also been invited. Their initial inability to attend caused some consternation, since they had voiced their support for American culture. At the last minute, Jackie Kennedy said she would be there.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} status as the largest {{warships}} in the U.S. Navy, the deployment of an aircraft carrier can <b>fulfill</b> <b>a</b> symbolic role, not {{just in terms of}} a deterrent to an enemy, but often as a diplomatic tool, in strengthening relations with allies and potential allies. The latter of these functions can take place either as a single visit to a country, in which senior naval officers are allowed to observe the operating of the carrier and to interact with its senior officers, or as part of an international task force. This can be in combat operations, such as NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, or other deployments involving training, such as Exercise RIMPAC. In addition, carriers have participated in international Maritime security operations, combating piracy in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Somalia.|$|E

5|$|Bosh {{eventually}} {{chose to}} follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management. There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so. Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, {{but by the end}} of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced him that he was ready for the NBA. He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he made the right decision to pursue a professional career. He said he intends to obtain a college degree in the future, to <b>fulfill</b> <b>a</b> promise made to his mother.|$|E
5|$|Five former Rams players also {{jumped to}} the Browns in 1946: center Mike Scarry, tackle Chet Adams and backs Gaylon Smith, Tommy Colella and Don Greenwood. Their move {{gave rise to a}} legal battle with the Rams, who left Cleveland for Los Angeles shortly after winning the 1945 NFL {{championship}} rather than compete with the Browns. Reeves, the Rams' owner, filed an injunction against Adams in federal court after he signed with the Browns, claiming the tackle unlawfully broke his contract to play for the Rams. Adams argued he had no obligation under his contract to play for the Rams because the team had changed to the Los Angeles Rams following the move. At the end of August 1946, federal judge Emerich Freed denied the Rams' injunction, allowing Adams to play for the Browns. The judge rejected the Rams' contention that Adams had signed to play for Reeves, not a specific team. He ruled the Cleveland Rams had ceased to exist, and that Adams therefore was not bound to <b>fulfill</b> <b>a</b> contract with the Los Angeles Rams.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with recommendations {{made by the}} California's Department of Education, Rocklin Unified School District students are taught using a standards-based curriculum; each student much <b>fulfill</b> <b>a</b> set of essential skills before {{they are allowed to}} pass the class. The program is initially implemented in district elementary schools. For some classes, like English, essential skills may be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade on assigned essays or tests. In classes like mathematics, Essential Skills must be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade in specific skills on cumulative tests. In addition, WHS policy does not allow F or D grades. Any grade below a grade of C is considered a No Mark (NM) or a No Credit (NC); the class must then be repeated to get a passing grade. This plan attempts to prepare students for the California High School Exit Exam, or CAHSEE test, which they are expected to pass prior to graduation; CAHSEE is provided to students during their second year. The test covers grade 6–10 language arts concepts, as well as pre-algebraic and Algebra I mathematics.|$|E

5|$|It is {{generally}} accepted by historians that Andrianjaka did indeed succeed {{to the throne}} around 1610 or 1612 after his older brother's claim {{was rejected by the}} public. All speculation about fanorona and royal summons aside, Ralambo may have chosen Andrianjaka based on the simple fact that {{he was the son of}} Ralambo's first wife. Ralambo's father, Andriamanelo, had established rules of succession by which Ralambo's first son by his first wife must rule after his father in order to <b>fulfill</b> <b>a</b> mandate established by his Vazimba antecedents Rafohy and Rangita. The passing over of Andriantompokoindrindra in favor of his younger brother was partially mitigated by the establishment of a royal tradition maintaining that all reigning descendants of Andrianjaka would henceforth be required to marry a princess directly descended from Andriantompokoindrindra, thereby preserving the royal status of descendants in both brothers' bloodlines.|$|E
5|$|Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement is a poem {{written by}} English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1796. Like his earlier poem The Eolian Harp, the poem {{discusses}} Coleridge's understanding {{of nature and}} his married life, which was suffering from problems that developed after the previous poem. Overall, the poem focuses on humanity's relationship with nature in its various aspects ranging from experiencing an Edenic state to having to abandon a unity with nature in order to <b>fulfill</b> <b>a</b> moral obligation to humanity. The discussion of man's obligation to each other leads into a discussion on {{the difference between the}} life of a philosopher and the life of a poet. By the end of the poem, the narrator follows the philosophical path {{in a manner similar to}} what Coleridge sought to do. The response to the poem from critics was mostly positive with many of them emphasizing the religious aspects of the poem in their analysis.|$|E
