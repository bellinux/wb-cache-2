40|$|We are {{concerned}} with fully nonlinear elliptic equations on complex manifolds and search for technical tools to overcome difficulties in deriving a priori estimates which arise due to the nontrivial torsion and curvature, {{as well as the}} general (non-pseudoconvex) shape of the boundary. We present our methods, which work for more general equations, by considering a specific equation which resembles the complex Monge-Ampere equation in many ways but with crucial differences. Our work is motivated by recent increasing interests in fully nonlinear equations on complex manifolds from geometric problems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a frequency domain {{test of time}} reversibility, the REVERSE test. It {{is based upon the}} bispectrum. We analytically establish the asymptotic distribution of the test and also explore its finite-sample properties through Monte-Carlo simulation. Following Ramsey and Rothman (1996), who demonstrated that the problem of business cycle asymmetry can be stated as whether macroeconomic fluctuations are time irreversible, in our application we use the REVERSE test as a frequency domain test of business cycle asymmetry. Our empirical results show that time irreversibility is the rule rather than the exception for a representative set of macroeconomic time series for five OECD countries. * The authors thank the participants of the 1996 symposium of the Society for Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>comment...</b>|$|R
