25|$|Shastri's {{sudden death}} {{has led to}} {{persistent}} conspiracy theories that he was poisoned. The first inquiry into his death, conducted by the Raj Narain Inquiry, as {{it came to be}} known, however did not come up with any conclusions, and today no record of this inquiry exists with the Indian Parliament's library. It was alleged that no post-mortem was done on Shastri, but the Indian government in 2009, claimed it did <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> of a medical investigation conducted by Shastri's doctor and some Russian doctors. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) revealed that there was no record of any destruction or loss of documents in the PMO having a bearing on Shastri's death. The Russian butler attending on Shastri {{at the time of his}} death was arrested for suspected poisoning but released later as per the news source. It was maintained that Shastri had died of cardiac arrest but his family insisted he was poisoned.|$|E
