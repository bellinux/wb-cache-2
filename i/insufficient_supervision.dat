40|$|Background: Acute {{inpatient}} {{care in the}} UK is being subjected to increasing critical scrutiny, highlighting concerns about content and quality. There is an absence of clarity and consensus on what acute {{inpatient care}} is for, adding to difficulties in developing this service sector. Aim: To define the function of acute psychiatric wards. Methods: Interviews were conducted with multidisciplinary staff (13 Ward Managers, 14 F Grade nurses, 11 Occupational Therapists and 9 Consultant Psychiatrists), on rationales for admission, their care and treatment philosophy, and the roles of different professionals. Results: Patients are admitted because they appear likely to harm themselves or others, {{and because they are}} suffering from a severe mental illness, and/or because they or their family/community require respite, and/or because they have <b>insufficient</b> support and <b>supervision</b> available to them in the community. The tasks of acute inpatient care are to keep patients safe, assess their problems, treat their mental illness, meet their basic care needs and provide physical healthcare. These tasks are completed via containment, 24 -hour staff presence, treatment provision, and complex organisation and management. Conclusions: Professional education, audit, research and the structuring of services all need to be oriented towards these tasks.

This study attempts to identify factors {{that may lead to}} the excessive use of force by police at protest demonstrations. A review of the literature revealed nine factors that may influence police behaviour: the presence of aggressive and violent protesters, high levels of officer stress, high levels of officer aggression, a loss of professional self-control, the influence of personal problems and the attitudes of individual officers, the influence of peer relations and the police sub-culture, <b>insufficient</b> and inadequate <b>supervision,</b> inadequate training and equipment, and insufficient and inaccurate communication, information, and planning. An analysis was conducted of six investigative reports of alleged excessive use of force by police at protest demonstrations. The results indicate that the predominant factor that led to the excessive use of force was insufficient and inaccurate communication, information, and planning by police and security personnel. Limitations of this thesis include the small number of official inquiry reports available; the subjective nature of coding, scoring, and ranking of factors; and the possibility that not all the factors that were identified in this study were considered by investigators of each of the six events as having contributed to the excessive use of force.

40|$|Introduction: Ethiopia {{launched}} a nationwide Health Extension Program (HEP) in 2003 {{with a view}} to addressing major health problems of the country by mainly focusing on essential promotion, preventive and selected high impact curative services that target households. The country’s health care service depends on close to 39, 000 Health Extension Workers (HEWs). Deployment of HEWs alone was reported to be was not enough to achieve better health outcome. Motivating such a workforce is an important element that deserves attention of all stakeholders. This study explored factors affecting HEWs motivation in rural, urban and pastoralist districts of Ethiopia in 2012. Methods: In this qualitative study, 19 people were interviewed: 12 HEWs and seven key informants from rural, urban and pastoralist districts of Ethiopia. Data on factors motivating and de-motivating HEWs as well as government HEP coordinators’ perceived support to HEWs motivation were gathered and analyzed. Results: Supportive supervision, continuing education, career structure and salary have been identified by rural HEWs as major motivating factors while they found competing interests such as marriage and family issues, absence of housing, and unrealistic performance expectation as factors inhibiting their motivation. The major factors found to be de-motivating for pastoralist HEWs were absence of transportation, poor <b>supervision,</b> <b>insufficient</b> training and lack of capacity among others. Absence of career development and limited recognition were also mentioned as de-motivating for urban HEWs. Conclusion: HEWs play a pivotal role in Ethiopia’s HEP.

Thestudy was conducted amongst EAPA-SA members to benchmark and explore the practice of the management and administration standard as prescribed by EAPA-SA Standards, as well as to identify any operational challenges in adhering to the above standards. A literature review outlines the history of EAPs in South Africa, the definition of concepts, discussions on the seven categories of management and administration standard as well as the theoretical framework upon which the study was grounded namely, General Systems Theory (GST). A quantitative, exploratory research approach was applied to identify and benchmark challenges in the field of practice, in implementing the management and administration standard of the EAPA-SA. The population included EAPA-SA members from both the public and private sectors. A structured questionnaire was administered electronically, using Qualtrics software. The research findings indicated that EAPA-SA members are aware of the standards document of EAPA-SA and make reference to the document on a regular basis during their practice. Positive highlights include the professional development activities that were considered, proper management of confidentiality and recordkeeping as well as knowledge of and compliance with the ethical requirements as outlined by Standards Committee of the EAPA-SA.

Recent research has shown that rework is the significant cause for schedule and cost overruns, quality deviations, poor safety, and client and contractor dissatisfaction in the building construction industry. Reducing rework is widely regarded as an effective way of improving construction performance in terms of productivity, cost, schedule, quality and safety. The research presented in this paper uses multiple completed building projects to identify the significant variables that contributed to rework. Rework factors’ identification and categorization are carried out on the basis of rework performing groups in the design and construction process and best practices are proposed in considering the stages of design and construction. This research develops generalized best practices and checklists, which are intended to reduce rework by managing construction building projects for the purpose of performance and productivity improvement.

However, {{with the rapid}} growth of the Web 2. 0, ranking over {{multiple}} interre-lated and heterogeneous objects becomes a common situation, e. g., the heterogeneous academic network. In this scenario, one may have much training data for some type of objects (e. g. conferences) while only very few for the interested types of objects (e. g. authors). Thus, the two important questions are: 1) Given a networked data set, how could one borrow supervision from other types of objects in order to build an accurate ranking model for the interested objects with <b>insufficient</b> <b>supervision?</b> 2) If there are links between different objects, how can we exploit their relationships for improved ranking performance? In this work, we first propose a regularized framework called HCDRank to simultaneously minimize two loss functions related to these two domains. Then, we extend the approach by exploiting the link information between heteroge-neous objects. We conduct a theoretical analysis to the proposed approach and derive its generalization bound to demonstrate how the two related domains could help each other in learning ranking functions.

In recent years, reports of this complication have been increasing, apparently in a geometrical progression: 8 %, 18 %, and 74 % were reported between 1976 to 1979, 1980 to 1983, and 1984 to 1987, respectively. Sixty-one percent occurred in patients aged 60 years or older. Most of the patients (84 %) were seriously ill, which compounded their complications. Seventy-four percent of all injuries were committed by house staff; the narrow bore tube with guide wire was used in 77 % of cases. Less than reliable methods were used to confirm tube position in most instances. The presence of cuffed endotracheal tubes did not offer protection. The patients on mechanical ventilation tended to deteriorate if they developed a pneumothorax once the malpositioned tubes were removed. Of the cases reviewed for this report, 18 deaths occurred; 72 % being {{directly related to the}} tube injuries. Lack of awareness, inadequate confirmatory methods, and <b>insufficient</b> <b>supervision</b> accounted for most of these preventable complications. Educating house/nursing staff {{in the use of the}} new tubes, closer supervision, and the application of equal measures of care and caution as employed in other invasive and potentially dangerous procedures are recommended to avoid disastrous outcome...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{probability}} {{and severity}} of effects of induced demand are because {{of the interaction between}} a range of factors that can affect physicians and patients behavior. It is also affected by the laws of the markets and organizational arrangements for medical services. This article studies major factors that affect the phenomenon of induced demand with the use of experts′ experiences of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Methods: The research is applied a qualitative method. Semi-structured interview was used for data generation. Participants in this study were people who had been informed in this regard and had to be experienced and were known as experts. Purposive sampling was done for data saturation. Seventeen people were interviewed and criteria such as data "reliability of information" and "stability" were considered. The anonymity of the interviewees was preserved. The data are transcribed, categorized and then used the thematic analysis. Results: In this study, thematic analysis was conducted, and 77 sub-themes and 3 themes were extracted respectively. The three main themes include infrastructural factors, social factors, and organizational structural factors affecting induced demand. Each of these also has some sub-themes. Conclusions: Results of this research present a framework for analyzing the major causes of induced demand. The causes identified here include complexity of medicine, information mismatch between service providers and consumers, clinical uncertainty, false beliefs, advertisements, <b>insufficient</b> <b>supervision,</b> scarcity of clinical guidelines, weakness of education system, and ignorance of medical ethics. These findings help policymakers to investigate the induced demand phenomenon clear-sighted...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the role of}} WECs in providing managerial support to CSSs in Kibondo district in Kigoma region. Three objectives were involved, to analyze the role of WECs in relation to CSSs, examine challenges of WECs in supporting CSSs and examine strategies employed by WECs in supervising the CSSs in Kibondo district. The study employed qualitative approach by using a case study design. Data were gathered by interviews, focus group discussions and documentary review, and were analyzed by content review. WECs were responsible in coordinating the implementation of education and training policy in CSSs in the ward. It was noted that, WECs were not prepared with new role to CSSs. The insufficient cooperation with HOSs and teachers, low incentives and meager salary, poor working environment and less of qualifications of WECs that affect managerial support to CSSs. Cross checking and inspecting teachers’ attendance register, and class journals, were among of the strategies employed by WECs in supporting managerial to CSSs. Management of CSSs through WECs is debatable because, most of WEC’s functions to secondary schools contradict with that of HOSs. Management of CSSs is complex and a situational process and WECs were not prepared to coordinate secondary schools. Strategies employed by WECs to CSSs were aimed at controlling teachers’ and HOSs attendance instead of encouraging and raising their morale in attending, teaching and general management of the CSSs. Poor management in CSSs continued to exist due to <b>insufficient</b> <b>supervision</b> in schools. The study recommends that government should improve among others WECs’ incentives, working environments and employ qualified WECs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Quality of {{supervision}} {{is a major}} predictor for successful PhD projects. A survey showed that almost all PhD students in the Health Sciences in Denmark indicated that good supervision was important for the completion of their PhD study. Interestingly, {{approximately half of the}} students who withdrew from their program had experienced <b>insufficient</b> <b>supervision.</b> This led the Research Education Committee at the University of Copenhagen to recommend that supervisors further develop their supervision competence. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore PhD supervisors’ self-reported needs and wishes regarding the content of a new program in supervision, with a special focus on the supervision of PhD students in medical fields. Methods A semi-structured interview guide was developed, and 20 PhD supervisors from the Graduate School of Health and Medical Sciences at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen were interviewed. Empirical data were analysed using qualitative methods of analysis. Results Overall, the results indicated a general interest in improved competence and development of a new supervision programme. Those who were not interested argued that, due to their extensive experience with supervision, they had no need to participate in such a programme. The analysis revealed seven overall themes to be included in the course. The clinical context offers PhD supervisors additional challenges that include the following sub-themes: patient recruitment, writing the first article, agreements and scheduled appointments and two main groups of students, in addition to the main themes. Conclusions The PhD supervisors reported the clear need and desire for a competence enhancement programme targeting the supervision of PhD students at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences. Supervision in the clinical context appeared to require additional competence. Trial registration The Scientific Ethical Committee for the Capital Region of Denmark.
