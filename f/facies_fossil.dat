The early to mid-Miocene (23 - 14 Mya) is a compelling interval to study as global temperatures and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations {{were similar to those}} projected for coming centuries. Importantly, this time interval includes the Miocene Climatic Optimum, a period of global warmth during which average surface temperatures were 3 - 4 °C higher than today. Miocene sediments in the ANDRILL- 2 A drill core from the Western Ross Sea, Antarctica, indicate that the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) was highly variable through this key time interval. A multiproxy dataset derived from the core identifies four distinct environmental motifs based on changes in sedimentary <b>facies,</b> <b>fossil</b> assemblages, geochemistry, and paleotemperature. Four major disconformities in the drill core coincide with regional seismic discontinuities and reflect transient expansion of grounded ice across the Ross Sea. They correlate with major positive shifts in benthic oxygen isotope records and generally coincide with intervals when atmospheric CO 2 concentrations were at or below preindustrial levels (∼ 280 ppm). Five intervals reflect ice sheet minima and air temperatures warm enough for substantial ice mass loss during episodes of high (∼ 500 ppm) atmospheric CO 2 These new drill core data and associated ice sheet modeling experiments indicate that polar climate and the AIS were highly sensitive to relatively small changes in atmospheric CO 2 during the early to mid-Miocene...|$|E
40|$|During the Sedimentation of the {{platform}} carbonate deposits of the Korallenoolith Formation (middle Oxfordian to early Kimmeridgian) small buildups ofcorals formed in the Lower Saxony Basin. These bioconstructions are restricted to particular horizons (Untere Korallenbank,ßorigenuna-Bank Member etc.) and represent patch reefs and biostromes. In this study, the development of <b>facies,</b> <b>fossil</b> assemblages, spatial distribution of fossils, and reefs of the ßorigenuna-Bank Member (upper Middle Oxfordian) in the Süntel Mts and the eastern Wesergebirge Mts is described; the formation of reefs is discussed in detail. Twelve facies types are described and interpreted. They vary between high-energy deposits as well winnowed oolites and quiet-water lagoonal mudstones. Owing to the significance of biota, micro- and macrofossils are systematically described. The reefs are preserved in growth position, are characterized by numerous corresponding features and belong to a certain reef type. According to their size, shape and framework, they represent patch reefs, coral knobs (sensu James, 1983), coral thrombolite reefs (sensu Leinfelder et al., 1994) or “Klein- and Mitteldickichte” (sensu Laternser, 2001). Their growth fabric corresponds to the superstratal (dense) pillarstone (sensu Insalaco, 1998). As {{the top of the}} ßorigenuna-Bank displays an erosional unconformity (so-called Hauptdiskontinuität), the top of the reefs are erosionally capped. Their maximum height amounts to at least the maximum thickness of the ßorigenuna-Bank which does not exceed 4 metres. The diversity of coral fauna of the reefs is relatively low; a total of 13 species is recorded. The coral community is over- whelmingly dominated by the thin-branched ramose Thamnasteria dendroidea (Lamouroux) that forms aggregations of colonies (77 ?. dendroidea thickets). Leafy to platy Fungiastrea arachnoides (Parkinson) and Thamnasteria concinna (Goldfuss) occur subordinately, other species are only of minor importance. In a few cases, the reef-core consisting of Th. dendroidea thickets is laterally encrusted by platy F. arachnoides and Th. concinna colonies, and microbial carbonates. This zonation reflects probably a succession of different reef builders as a result of changing environmental conditions (allogenic succession). Moreover, some reefs are overlain by a biostrome made of large Solenopora jurassica nodules passing laterally in a nerinean bed. Mikrobial carbonates promoted reef growth and favoured the preservation of reef organismn in their growth position or in situ. They exhibit a platy, dendroid, or reticulate growth form or occur as downward-facing hemispheroids. According to their microstructure, they consist of a peloidal, clotted, or unstructured fabric (predominately layered and poorly structured thrombolite as well as clotted leiolite) (sensu Schmid, 1996). Abundant endo- and epibiontic organisms (bivalves, gastropods, echinoids, asteroids, ophiuroids, crabs etc) are linked to the reefs. With regard to their guild structure, the reefs represent occurrences at which only a few coral species serve as builder. Moreover, microbial carbonates contribute to both building and binding of the reefs. Additional binder as well as baffler are present, but not abundant. According to the species diversity, the dweller guild comprises by far the highest number of invertebrate taxa. The destroyer guild chiefly encompasses bivalves. The composition of the reef community was influenced by the habitat structure of the Th. dendroidea thickets. Owing to the increase in encrusting organisms and other inhabitants of the thickets, the locational factors changed, since light intensity and hydrodynamic energy level and combined parameters as oxygen supply declined in the crowded habitat. Therefore a characteristic succession of organisms is developed that depends on and responds to changing environmental conditions („community replacement sequence“). The succession allows the differentiation of different stages. It started after the cessation of the polyps with boring organisms and photoautotrophic micro-encrusters (calcareous algae, Lithocodium aggregatum). Following the death of these pioneer organisms, encrusting and adherent organisms (serpulids, „Terebella“ species, bryozoans, foraminifers, thecideidinids, sklerospongid and pharetronid sponges, terebratulids), small mobile organisms (limpets), and microbial induced carbonates developed. The final stage in the community replacement sequence gave rise to small cryptic habitats and organisms that belong to these caves (cryptobionts, coelobites). The habitat conditions especially favoured small non-rigid demosponges (“soft sponges”) that tolerate reduced water circulation. Reef rubble is negligible, so that the reefs are bordered by fossiliferous micritic limestone passing laterally in micritic limestone. Approximately 10 % of the study area (outcropping florigemma-Bank) corresponds to reefal deposits whereas the remaining 90 % encompass lagoonal inter-reefal deposits. The reef development is a good example for the interaction between reef growth, facies development and sea-level changes. It was initiated by a sea-level rise (transgression) and corresponding decrease in the hydrodynamic energy level. Colonization and reef growth took place on a coarse-grained Substrate composed of oncoids, larger foraminifers and bioclasts. Reef growth took place in a calm marine lagoonal setting. Increasing abundance of spherical coral morphs towards the Northeast (section Kessiehausen, northwestem Süntel Mts) reflects higher turbidity and a facies transition to coral occurrences of the ßorigenuna-Bank Member in the adjacent Deister Mts. The reef growth was neither influenced by stonns nor by input of siliciclastic deposits, and took place in short time - probably in only a thousand years under most probably mesotrophic conditions. The mass appearance of solenoporids and nerineids in {{the upper part of the}} ßorigenuna-Bank Member point to enhanced nutrient level as a result of regression. In addition, this scenario of fluctuations in nutrient availability seems to be responsible for the cessation of reef corals. The sea level fall reached its climax in the subaerial exposure and palaeokarst development of the florigemma-Bank. The reef building corals are typical pioneer species. The blade-like, flattened F. amchnoides colonies are characterized by their light porous calcium carbonate skeleton, which is a distinct advantage in soft bottom environment. Thus, they settled on soft bottom exposing the large parts of its surface to the incoming light. On the other hand, in response to their light requirements they were also able to settle shaded canopy structures or reef caves. Th. dendroidea is an opportunistic coral species in very shallow, well illuminated marine environment. Their thin and densely spaced branches led to a very high surface/volume ratio of the colonies that were capable to exploit incoming light due to their small thamasterioid calices characterized by “highly integrated polyps”. In addition, sideward coalescence of branches during colony growth led to a wave-resistant framework and favoured the authochthonous preservation of the reefs. Asexual reproduction by fragmented colonies promoted reef development as Th. dendroidea thickets laterally extend over the sea floor or new reefs have developed from broken fragments of parent colonies. Similar build ups with Th. dendroidea as a dominant or frequent reef building coral species are known from the Paris Basin and elsewhere from the Lower Saxony Basin (Kleiner Deister Mts). These buildups developed in well-illuminated shallow water and encompass coral reefs or coral thrombolite reefs. Intra- and inter-reef deposits vary between well-winnowed reef debris limestone and mudstones representing considerably calmer conditions. Solenoporid, nerineids and diceratides belong to the characteristic fossils of these occurrences. However, diceratides are missing in theflorigemma-Bank Member. Th. dendroidea differs in its colonization of low- to high-energy environment from recent ramose scleractinian corals (e. g., Acropora and Porites sp.). The latter are restricted to agitated water habitats creating coral thickets and carpets. According to the morphologic plasticity of Th. dendroidea, thick-branched colonies developed in a milieu of high water energy, whereas fragile, wide- and thin-branched colonies prevail in low-energy settings. Due to its relatively rapid growth, Th. dendroidea was able to keep pace with increased Sedimentation rates. 68 benthonic foraminiferan species/taxa have been recognized in thin sections. Agglutinated foraminifers (textulariids) predominate when compared with rotaliids and milioliids. Numerous species are restricted to a certain facies type or occur in higher population densities, in particular Everticyclammina sp., a larger agglutinated foraminifer that occurs in rock building amounts. Among the 25 reef dwelling foraminiferal species, a few were so far only known from Late Jurassic sponge reefs. Another striking feature is the frequency of adherent foraminiferal species. Fauna and flora, in particular dasycladaleans and agglutinated foraminifers, document palaeobiogeographic relationships to the Tethys and point to (sub) tropical conditions. Moreover, in Germany this foraminiferan assemblage is yet uncompared. In Southern Germany similar tethyan type assemblages are not present in strata as young as Middle Tithonian. Während der Sedimentation der Plattformkarbonate des Korallenoolith (Mittleres Oxfordium bis Unteres Kimmeridgium) entstanden im Niedersächsischen Becken auch kleine Biokonstruktionen aus Korallen. Sie sind an wenige Horizonte (u. a. Untere Korallenbank und florigemma-Bank) gebunden und bilden Fleckenriffe und Biostrome. In dieser Arbeit wird die fazielle Ausbildung der florigenwia-Bank (höheres Mittleres Oxfordium) einschließlich des Liegenden und Hangenden im Süntel und östlichen Wesergebirge unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der Riffe untersucht. Es werden 12 Faziestypen beschrieben, deren Spektrum zwischen hochenergetischen, gut ausgewaschenen Kalkoolithen und niederenergetischem lagunären Kalklutit variiert. Aufgrund der großen Bedeutung biogener Komponenten erfolgt ebenso eine systematische Bearbeitung der Mikro- und Makrofossilien. Die Riffe sind weitgehend autochthon überliefert. Sie weisen eine Vielzahl übereinstimmender Merkmale auf und gehören einem Rifftyp an. Es sind Fleckenriffe und Riffknospen (sensu James, 1983), Korallen-Thrombolith-Riffe (sensu Leinfelder et al., 1994) bzw. Klein- und Mitteldickichte (sensu Latemser, 2001). Ihr autochthones Riffgefüge entspricht dem superstratalen (dense) Pillarstone (sensu Insalaco, 1998). Die Riffe werden nach oben durch eine Erosionsfläche (Hauptdiskontinuität) begrenzt. Ihre ursprüngliche Höhe dürfte kaum die maximale Mächtigkeit der florigenwia-Bank von 4 m überschritten haben. Die buschförmige Thamnasteria dendroidea (Lamouroux) dominiert die Korallenfauna und bildet heckenartige Vorkommen (Th. dendroidea-Gestrüppe). Fungiastrea arachnoides (Parkinson) und Thamnasteria concinna (Goldfuss) mit horizontalplattiger Wuchsform sind ebenfalls wichtige Riffbildner, andere Korallenarten sind nur untergeordnet vertreten. Aus der seitlichen Inkrustierung der Th. dendroidea-Gestrüppe durch F. arachnoides- und Th. concinna-Stöcke resultiert eine Zonierung der Riffe, die wahrscheinlich eine zeitliche Aufeinanderfolge von sich an einem Standort ablösenden Riffbildner- Vergesellschaftungen als Folge von Umweltveränderungen widerspiegelt (allogene Sukzession). Typisch ist zudem die Überlagerung der Riffe durch große Solenoporayz/rass/ca-Knollen. Mikrobielle Karbonate haben den Aufbau der Riffe erheblich unterstützt, indem sie die Korallenstöcke inkrustieren. Sie treten in flächiger, dendroider und reticulater Wuchsform sowie als Hemisphäroid-Mikrobialithe auf und haben eine peloidale oder dichte Mikrostruktur (vorwiegend lagige und strukturarme Thrombolithe sowie klumpige Leiolithe) (sensu Schmid, 1996). Die Riffe waren der Lebensraum einer artenreichen Fauna endo- und epilithischer Organismen sowie epi- und endofaunaler Benthonten (Muscheln, Schnecken, Seeigel, Seesterne, Schlangensterne, Krebse u. v. m.). In bezug auf ihre Gildenstruktur stellen sie gute Beispiele für Vorkommen dar, in denen nur wenige Korallenarten als Riffbildner auftreten und mikrobielle Karbonate eine Doppelfunktion als Bildner und Binder erfüllen. Weitere Binder und auch Sedimentfänger haben keine Bedeutung. Die Bewohner-Gilde ist durch Artenreichtum gekennzeichnet. Als Zerstörer waren vor allem Bohrmuscheln aktiv. Der Aufbau der Riffgemeinschaft wird erheblich durch die Th. dendroidea-Ge strüppe, die eine charakteristische Mikrohabitat- Struktur aufweisen, beeinflusst. Infolge der biogenen Anlagerung veränderten sich in den Gestrüppen die Standortbedingungen für die Besiedler, da Lichtintensität und Hydrodynamik abnahmen und sich an die Wasserbewegung gekoppelte Parameter, z. B. Sauerstoffzufuhr, verschlechterten. Deshalb ist eine charakteristische Abfolge stets wiederkehrender Organismen, die an die jeweiligen Lebensbedingungen angepasst sind, ausgebildet („community replacement sequence“ bzw. autogene Sukzession). Die Sukzession lässt sich in Stadien einteilen und wird nach dem Absterben der Korallen- Polypen durch Bohrorganismen und photoautotrophe Mikroinkmstierer (u. a. Kalkalgen) eingeleitet. Den Pionierorganismen folgen weitere inkrustierende oder auf Hartsubstrat angeheftete Organismen (Serpeln, Terebellen, Bryozoen, Foraminiferen, Thecideen, sklerospongide und pharetronide Schwämme, Terebrateln), vagile Benthonten (Napfschnecken) sowie durch die Aktivität von Mikroben erzeugte mikrobielle Karbonate. Auch Napfschnecken haben sich als vagile Benthonten durch morphologische Anpassung („Kleinwiichsigkeit“) die Gestrüppe als Lebensraum erschlossen. Im finalen Stadium boten kryptische Mikrohabitate eine Nische für Coelobiten. Zu ihnen gehören kleine Demospongier mit unverbundenen Megaskleren („Weichschwämme“), die als aktive Filtrierer geringe oder fehlende Wasserzirkulation tolerieren. Die Riffe lieferten während ihres Wachstums kaum Schutt. Sie sind von fossilreichem mikritischen Kalkstein umgeben, der seitlich rasch in nahezu fossilleeren mikritischen Kalkstein übergeht. Etwa 10 % der Fläche des Untersuchungsgebietes entspricht Rifffazies, die restlichen 90 % entsprechen lagunären Zwischenriffablagerungen. Das Auftreten der Riffe ist an eine bathymetrische Vertiefung des Ablagerungsraumes (Transgression) und an das Nachlassen der Hydrodynamik gekoppelt. Riffwachstum setzte auf grobkörnigem Lockersubstrat ein. Die Riffe entwickelten sich unter weitgehend uniformen Ablagerungsbedingungen in einem sehr flachen, niederenergetischen Ablagerungsraum mit instabilen Karbonatschlammböden. Durch die größere Häufigkeit von knollig-kugeligen Korallenwuchsformen in der Lokalität Kessiehausen sind im nordöstlichen Süntel höhere Wasserenerergieverhältnisse und fazielle Übergänge zu Korallenvorkommen der/ 7 origemma- Bank im Deister dokumentiert. Das Riffwachstum fand unbeeinflusst von Sturmereignissen und siliziklastischem Eintrag vom Festland statt. Es erfolgte in geologisch kürzester Zeit - wahrscheinlich in ca. 1000 Jahre. Insgesamt sind mesotrophe Bedingungen während des Riffwachstums anzunehmen. Im höheren Abschnitt der florigemma-Bank zeichnet sich durch die Massenentfaltung von Solenoporen und Nerineen eine Erhöhung der Nährstoffkonzentration infolge Regression ab. Sie ist wohl auch für das Absterben der Riffkorallen verantwortlich. Die regressive Phase erreichte mit dem Trockenfallen und der Paläoverkarstung derflorigemma-Bank ihren Höhepunkt. Die riffbildenden Korallen sind ausgewiesene Pionierformen. Die horizontal-foliosen, aufgrund des maschenartigen Aufbaus sehr leichten Kolonien der formkonservativen F. arachnoides sind hochtolerant gegenüber instabilem Substrat. Sie wachsen direkt auf Weichboden und nutzen die volle Lichtintensität oder besiedeln dank ihres geringen Lichtbedarfs auch überhängende Riffbereiche und Riffhohlräume. Th. dendroidea ist eine opportunistische Koralle des lichtdurchfluteten Flachwassers. Durch ihre filigranen Äste weisen die ramosen Kolonien ein besonders großes Oberfläche/Volumen-Verhältnis auf. Ihre kleinen thamnasterioiden Kelche mit „hochintegrierten Polypen“ waren vorzüglich befähigt, Licht „einzufangen“. Seitliches Verschmelzen der Äste während des Koloniewachstums rief ein wellenresistentes Riffgerüst hervor und begünstigte die in situ-Überlieferung der Riffe. Vegetative Vermehrung durch Fragmente trug erheblich zu ihrem Erfolg bei, indem sich die Riffe seitlich ausbreiteten oder neue Riffe initiiert wurden. Vergleichbare Vorkommen, in denen Th. dendroidea wichtiger Riffbildner ist, die Korallenfauna dominiert oder nahezu monospezifische Gestrüppe aufbaut, sind aus dem Pariser Becken und dem Kleinen Deister (Niedersächsisches Becken) bekannt. Sie entstanden im intensiv lichtdurchfluteten Flachwasser von nur wenigen Metern Wassertiefe und repräsentieren Korallen-Riffe oder Korallen-Thrombolith-Riffe. Assoziierte Sedimente variieren zwischen gut ausgewaschenem Riffschuttkalkstein und niederenergetischem Kalklutit. Solenoporen, Nerineen und Diceraten zählen zu den charakteristischen Fossilien dieser Vorkommen, letztere fehlen in der florigemma-Bank. Th. dendroidea unterscheidet sich durch die Besiedlung nieder- bis hochenergetischer Habitate von formverwandten rezenten Steinkorallen (z. B. Acropora- und Porites- Arten). Letztere sind an wellenexponierte Standorte adaptiert, wo sie Korallenhecken aufbauen. Im hochenergetischen Milieu wurde die Bruchempfindlichkeit durch die Ausbildung robuster, derbästiger Th. dendroidea-Kolonien reduziert, während an niederenergetischen Standorten filigrane, diinnästige Kolonien vorherrschten. Infolge raschen vertikalen Wachstums hielten die Kolonien einiger Vorkommen auch mit hohen Sedimentationsraten schritt. In Dünnschliffen ließen sich 68 Foraminiferenarten/-taxa nachweisen. Agglutinierende, darunter zahlreiche Formen mit großem, komplex gebauten Gehäuse, dominieren gegenüber Hyalinschalern und Milioliden. Zahlreiche Arten sind durch eine ausgeprägte Milieuabhängigkeit gekennzeichnet oder kommen in hohen Individuendichten vor. Es sind 25 riffbewohnende Arten belegt, von denen einige bisher nur aus oberjurassischen Schwammriffen bekannt waren; bemerkenswert ist die Vielzahl von an Hartsubstrat festgehefteten Arten. Fauna und Flora, insbesondere Dasycladaceen und sandschalige Foraminiferen, zeigen enge paläobiogeographische Beziehungen zur Tethys auf, woraus sich (sub) tropische Bedingungen folgern lassen. Für die Zeit des Oxfordium ist diese Foraminiferenfauna innerhalb von Deutschland einmalig. In Süddeutschland stellen sich vergleichbare tethyale Faunen erst im Mittleren Tithonium ein...|$|E

The kimberlite magma transporting the diamonds from the upper mantle erupted through a sequence ofKaroo-aged rocks before the deposition ofthe Kalahari Sands. This eruption has been radiometrically dated at early Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian-Coniacian). When volcanism ceased, a succession of epiclastic crater lake sediments was deposited above the kimberlite plug. Analysis of these sediments, which mostly comprise the results of mudflows and debris flows and fmer sediments during quiescenttimes, suggests that most of the sediments within the crater were deposited rapidly as mass flows, and were therefore mobilised soon after the volcanic eruption.

The foraminiferal–algal community is dominated by fusulinids and calcareous algae, but was soon replaced by the phylloid algal community. With an increase of terrestrial input, the phylloid algal community was again replaced by the bryozoan community. Near the end of the Middle Permian, with a decrease of terrestrial input, the bryozoan fossil community disappeared while the Ungdarella community became dominant.

Both the <b>facies</b> and <b>fossil</b> content of the bed (ammonites, belemnites, brachiopods, bivalves, crinoids, stromatolite structures and planktic foraminifera) are indicative of marine sedimentary conditions. However, the revision of biostratigraphic data, as well as taphonomic analysis, confirm the presence of a basin-extent stratigraphic and registratic gap involving at least the upper Lamberti and Mariae zones. Taphonomic features shown by ammonite internal moulds, such as disarticulation surfaces, truncation surfaces, phosphate infilling, and in some cases ellipsoidal abrasion facets and annular furrows, are evidence of taphonomic reelaboration. The latter abrasion features indicate that ammonite reelaborated moulds stood for long time on the sea bottom after being exhumed and were abraded by the action of shallow directional currents under extremely shallow intertidal to even supratidal conditions, resulting in a probable widespread sub aerial exposure of the platform. All this supports the hypothesis of the boundary bed being formed in punctuated sedimentary events during lower and, most probably, early middle Oxfordian. These data are of primary importance to understand the palaeogeographic setting of the northeastern Iberian Platform at the turn of Middle-Upper Jurassi...|$|R

The northern border of the group is in contact with the Imaura group (=Torinosu group) in fault. The southern border of the group is cut by the Butsuzo line and comes into contact with the Matoya group in the Shimanto terrain. It is composed mostly of sandstone and chert with mudstone, alternations of sandstone and mudstone, and schalstein. Several limestone lenses are intercalated in the schallstein. The general trend of the group is ENE-WSW and dips steeply (50 °- 70 °) to the north. The following foraminifer fossils were discovered by the author from a limestone lens at the south-western part of the Aonomine-san, Shima Peninsula. Yabeina sp. indet. Reichelina sp. indet. Kahlerina sp. indet. Pachyphloia sp. indet. The first (Yabeina. sp. indet.) is abundantly contained in the limestone lens, being very similar to Yabeina globosa from the Upper Permian of Japan (Akasaka limestone, Gifu Pref.; Wakasugi group, Tokushima Pref.; Yonagu formation, Kumamoto Pref.; Kwanto-mountainland). From the above mentioned data, the present group is correlative with the Upper Permian (Yabeina zone).

The near-field Gippsland sea level (GSL) curve shares many similarities to the far-field New Jersey sea level (NJSL) estimates.

In this work, we clarify the generation and development of that basin during the Late Campanian–Late Maastrichtian through construction of the sequence of stratigraphic frameworks. That is based on the identification of <b>facies</b> associations, <b>fossils</b> assemblages, and parasequences analyses, stacking patterns and depositional system orders or the geometry of deposits. Also, we identify the type and duration of the sequence boundaries, the gap causes and their durations, in different tectonic zones, as well as along the Zagros trend.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{describe}} ‘baksteenkalk’, an erratic silicified bioclastic carbonate of the Upper Sandbian {{from the eastern}} part of the Netherlands. To date, baksteenkalk has received little attention among palaeontologists. This is to be regretted on two grounds. First, baksteenkalk contains a varied fossil flora and fauna comprising many species, several of which are not or only rarely found in coeval rocks. Second, owing to a complicated silicification process, fossils, in particular algae, have preserved exceptional anatomical details. The primary aim of this study is to arouse the interest of professional, in particular, Estonian, palaeontologists in baksteenkalk. Based on lithology and fossil assemblage (most conspicuously, with regard to the algal flora), two basic types of baksteenkalk are distinguished. A list of species, differentiated for both types, is provided. It is argued that baksteenkalk reflects the ecology of a shallow, subtropical, epicontinental sea. The distribution of erratics, <b>facies</b> and <b>fossil</b> content point to an origin within the North Estonian Confacies Belt, probably west of Estonia. Baksteenkalk survived as an erratic because it was already silicified at its place of origin. A potential source of silica may have been Upper Ordovician bentonite layers. The causes and mechanisms of the silicifi­cation process which gave shape to baksteenkalk are not yet understood, however. The palaeontology of baksteenkalk is compared with that of two other erratic Sandbian silicified carbonates of Baltic origin: German Backsteinkalk and ‘Lavender-blue Hornstein’...|$|R

40|$|Main articleThe Orapa {{kimberlite}} pipe, {{situated in}} north-central Botswana, is well-known for its rich reserves of diamonds. It is indeed {{one of the}} largest and richest diamond mines in the world. The kimberlite magma transporting the diamonds from the upper mantle erupted through a sequence ofKaroo-aged rocks before the deposition ofthe Kalahari Sands. This eruption has been radiometrically dated at early Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian-Coniacian). When volcanism ceased, a succession of epiclastic crater lake sediments was deposited above the kimberlite plug. Analysis of these sediments, which mostly comprise the results of mudflows and debris flows and fmer sediments during quiescenttimes, suggests that most of the sediments within the crater were deposited rapidly as mass flows, and were therefore mobilised soon after the volcanic eruption. Buried within the fine-grained sediments is a unique assemblage of fossils including flowering plants and many whole-bodied insects. The fossils are commonly exquisitely preserved in extremely fine-grained mudstone. Interpretation of the sedimentary <b>facies</b> and <b>fossils</b> is that the mid-Cretaceous climate of central Botswana was temperate, seasonal and wet, and the area surrounding the crater was forested. The fossils represent the recovery of the biota of the area after the violent eruptions of Orapa and other nearby kimberlite fissures and pipes. The fossils have contributed considerably to our understanding of mid-Cretaceous insects and flowering plants and suggest intimate relationships between the two at an early stage in the radiation of flowering plants. It seems that southern Gondwana (including southern Africa) was a centre of diversification for both insects and angiosperms in the mid-Cretaceous.

The study area is restricted to the Gaza and Middle-to Khan Younis Governorates of the Gaza Strip. The Gaza Strip is a southwestern part of the Coastal Plain of Palestine. To accomplish these aims, data collected from field observations of outcropping rocks, boreholes, and hydrogeological wells has been used. The logging of selected sections paid attention to genetic facies associations. A generalized stratigraphic cross section has been established. It shows that the Kurkar Group (Gaza Formation) {{in the study area}} consists of five informal, descriptive lithostratigraphic units (Unit-A through Unit-E). These units are mainly made of calcareous sandstones (Kurkar) and separated by mudstone (Hamra) subunits. These mudstone subunits are lense-like, and their lateral extensions and thicknesses decrease upwards of the succession. Sedimentologically, four facies associations have been described and interpreted, namely, Kurkar, Hamra, swamp, and alluvial, plus dune sands and recent soils. The Kurkar <b>facies</b> association represented <b>fossil</b> dunes of aeolian origin pushed forward by the sea, whereas, Hamra palaeosols are polygenetic and originated in humid environments...|$|R

The Triassic succession of this unit is composed of a lower meta-detrital formation overlain by an upper meta-car- bonate formation divided in six members. In the latter, a Ladinian–Carnian-rich fossil association has been found (foraminifers, algae, bivalves, microproblematica, trace <b>fossils).</b> <b>Facies</b> {{analysis has}} enabled the recognition of 22 facies of platform origin. This succession accumulated as a subsiding margin-type carbonate platform with homoclinal ramp geometry (Anisian?–Ladinian) evolving into a fault- block-type platform with a steeper-margined geometry (Ladinian–Carnian). Slope deposits of this latter platform show a prism-like geometry with progradational patterns and include syn-sedimentary structures associated with normal faults capped by younger beds. The {{results of the present}} research indicate that the architecture of the plat- form studied has been controlled mainly by climate and oceanic factors during the development of the ramp, and by syn-sedimentary extensional tectonics during the develop- ment of the steeper-margined platform.

Braided alluvial facies associations contain charred conifer woods (family Pinaceae) possibly derived from upland forest fires, and abundant charred angiosperm woods, flowers and inflorescences (families Lauraceae and ?Platanaceae) derived from riparian gallery forest fires (Unit 2). Retrogradational coastal salt marsh facies associations contain abundant charred conifer wood (families Cheirolepidiaceae and Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae) derived from fires in halophytic backswamp forest, and rare pinaceous charred cones and lauraceous angiosperm wood washed downstream from fires further inland (Units 3 – 4). Progradational coastal facies associations within an estuary mouth setting contain abundant charred conifer wood (family Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae), common taxodiaceous conifer and angiosperm leaves, fern rachises, and lycopsid stems derived from fires in mesic backswamp taxodiaceous forests and supra-tidal fern-lycopsid thickets (Unit 5). Growth rings in angiosperm and conifer woods, leaf physiognomy and computer models indicate that climate was equable, warm and humid, {{but that there}} was a short annual dry season; most fires probably occurred during these annual drought periods.

40|$|The {{study of}} modern {{carbonate}} systems is commonly helps in improving <b>facies</b> interpretation in <b>fossil</b> reefs and in providing analogues of sediment distribution {{depending on the}} specific platform configuration (i. e. rimmed shelves and isolated carbonate platforms). This paper deals with a geomorphological and sedimentological study of the Glorieuses Archipelago, an isolated carbonate platform located between {{the northern tip of}} Madagascar and Mayotte. The dataset consists of Digital Terrain Model, satellite imagery, and box-sediment samples. Analyses of grain-size and composition of carbonate grains are used to characterize the distribution and heterogeneity of sediment accumulated on the isolated platform. Main results show that the Glorieuses Archipelago is organized in distinctive morphological units, including a reef flat developed along the windward side, an apron, and a semi-enclosed (12 m and up to 15 m water depth). The lack of carbonate mud in sediments deposited on the archipelago {{can be explained by the}} direct connection between the lagoon and the open ocean. The main carbonate grains include Halimeda segments, coral fragments, large benthic foraminifers, red algae, and molluscs. According to the shape and the position of intertidal sandwaves, the current arrangement of moderately sorted fine to medium sands appears to be strongly influenced by tidal currents. The in-situ sediment production, accumulation and transport on the platform finally contribute to carbonate sand export to distinct deep marine areas depending on wind regimes and currents...|$|R
40|$|The Upper Rhine Graben (URG) is {{a complex}} rift and wrench basin about 300 km long, 35 to 50 km wide and filled with up to 3500 m of Eocene to Quaternary sediments. Middle to Late Eocene {{lacustrine}} and saline deposits cover an area of c. 7500 km² of the central and southern segment of the URG. Thicknesses vary from a few metres of palustrine limestone to more than 1000 m of halite-bearing marls. Lithofacies associations include bedded halite-bituminous marl alternations with salic paleosols, laminated marls with poor freshwater fauna, partly with intercalated paleosol horizons, poorly bedded marls with paleosols and sandstone beds, and palustrine limestone with pisolites and freshwater gastropods. An marginal facies belt of cyclic channelized alluvial conglomerates, sandstones and rooted overbank mudstones is typically only a few kilometres wide and rapidly replaced by block conglomerates of steeply sloped fan-delta deposits close to the rift margins. There is a first-order shift of facies boundaries in the Eocene succession, indicating rapid transgressive drowning of the internal parts of the basin in the Lutetian and successive progradation of fluviolacustrine environments during the Priabonian. Paleosol <b>facies</b> and <b>fossil</b> content do not show {{significant changes in the}} overall climate regime over this transgressive-regressive cycle, spanning almost 10 Ma. Thus, we attribute this first-order cycle trend mainly to early syn-rift tectonics creating accommodation space and its subsequent autocyclic fill-up. In any of these facies there is evidence for high-frequency cyclic variations in lake level and salinity, e. g. by alternations of halite deposits and fossiliferous freshwater marls, recurring pedogenic overprint on laminated hypolimnion deposits, and subaqueous green clay intercalations within successions of palustrine carbonates. They suggest rapid lake level oscillations between deep freshwater lake phases and intense droughts, reducing the open-water surface to a small and shallow salt lake in the deepest parts of the Graben. The time scale of these oscillations is poorly constrained. According to the maturity of the paleosols, time intervals seem to represent cycles well within the Milankovich frequency band, i. e., 10 e 4 to 10 e 5 yr, and thus suggest a climatic control on these small-scale cycles...|$|R

TITLE: FACIES ANALYSIS, DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS AND SEQUENCE STRATIGRAPHY OF THE STE.

Genevieve Limestone consists of shallow marine carbonates deposited in a carbonate ramp platform. Sequence stratigraphic classification of these sediments has proved challenging due to low gradients, heterogeneous facies distribution and variable thermal related basin subsidence. The {{purpose of this}} study is facies analysis and recognition of important stratigraphic surfaces and facies trends to sub-divide the Ste. Genevieve succession into transgressive-regressive cycles (sequences) of various orders in outcrop (Johnson and Union Counties) and subsurface (southwest Franklin and Williamson County) of Southern Illinois.

These assemblages include diverse Ovetian archaeocyaths, trilobites, small shelly fossils, calcimicrobes, trace fossils and stromatolites. Trace fossils are still poorly known, and thus they are the main objective of this work. Ichnological data are obtained from the Arroyo de Pedroche 1, Arroyo de Pedroche 2 and Puente de Hierro sections. Trace fossils include the ichnogenera Bergaueria, aff. Bilinichnus, Cochlichnus, aff. Cosmorhaphe?, Cylindrichnus, Dactyloidites, Dimorphichnus, Diplichnites, Monocraterion, Palaeophycus, aff. Phycodes, Planolites, Psammichnites, Rusophycus, Skolithos, Torrowangea and Treptichnus, as well as faecal pellets, meniscate trace fossils and others. They are abundant in shales and sandstones, and indicate important changes in the benthic conditions with respect to the underlying Torrearboles Formation. Changes in fossil assemblages within Member I of the Pedroche Formation indicate palaeoccological disruptions, which led to the disappearance of numerous archaeocyath species and the decrease of stromatolite biodiversity. This was followed by dominance of trilobite and brachiopod assemblages, accompanied by trace fossils of the Psammichnites ichnosp. A ichnoassociation. This biotic turnover (Pedroche event) occurred at {{the lower part of the}} archaeocyath Zone III, within the Bigotina bivallata biozone.

40|$|The Pirro Nord palaeontological and archaeological {{locality}} {{has been}} the object of recent field research to investigate the fossil content of its Early Pleistocene vertebrate palaeocommunities, and to understand {{the genesis of the}} karst network and related deposits that delivered the lithic industry representing the earliest human occupation of Europe known so far, spanning 1. 7 - 1. 3 Ma. The succession of the Pirro 10 site has been described in terms of <b>facies</b> and <b>fossil</b> vertebrate content of the 37 distinguished Sedimentary Units (SU). On the whole, the succession is made of chemical and clastic sediments that include debris fall and alluvial deposits. SU are distinguished according to lithology, colour, discontinuities, lamination, fossil concentration, and taphonomical parameters. Palaeomagnetic data and biochronological characteristics refer the Pirro 10 site to the latest Late Villafranchian Mammal Age of the Italian biochronological mammal scale. The fossil content is quite homogenous. Common taxa are Axis eurygonos, Hystrix refossa, Ursus etruscus, Canis mosbachensis together with small mammal remains mainly represented by Chiroptera and the arvicolid Microtus (Allophaiomys) ex gr. ruffoi. A significant change in the taxonomic record occurs in SU 22 and 108, where a clear increase of Equus altidens and Bison (Eobison) degiulii remains indicates shifting towards drier and more open environments and possibly deteriorating local climatic conditions. In general, for all phases, taphonomic evidence suggests that (1) bone accumulation results from carcass transport into the cave system by accident, (2) skeletons were decomposed and partially disarticulated near the cave entrance, (3) the cave environment caused corrosion, desquamation and pitting, and (4) bones were moved within the cave system by water flow, usually for short distances. Pirro 10, Pirro 13 and all karst structures of the Pirro Nord locality during Early Pleistocene were part of a complex interconnected karst system. Dissolution was more effective along the highly fractured corezones of the Pliocene fault that bounded the "Apricena horst" to the south, where Pirro 10 gallery and Pirro 13 shaft are located. At that time, Pirro 10 was developed within the vadose zone whereas Pirro 13 represented a vertical structure connecting the surface to an underground karst floor. In general, the filling of Pirro 10 indicates fluctuations of the base level: water flow circulation in phreatic and epiphreatic conditions led to the deposition of clastic sediments, whereas flowstones reflect base level lowerings.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Previous {{studies of}} the {{sequence}} stratigraphic distribution of fossils {{have focused on the}} record of relatively abundant marine invertebrates. Only a handful of studies have examined how sequence stratigraphic architecture influences the occurrence of vertebrates, particularly large and rare tetrapods. The Jurassic Sundance Formation of the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, USA, contains a rich suite of invertebrate and vertebrate fossils, including large and rare marine reptiles, and this allows the sequence stratigraphic controls on the distribution of these groups to be compared. The Sundance Formation consists of four depositional sequences, with the lower two being carbonate dominated and the upper two siliciclastic dominated. Two incised valley fills are also present. The presence of multiple depositional sequences and strongly erosional sequence boundaries is the likely cause of the complicated lithostratigraphic nomenclature of the Sundance. Invertebrates (mollusks and echinoderms) in the Sundance conform to well-established patterns of occurrences, including strong <b>facies</b> control and <b>fossil</b> concentrations at maximum flooding surfaces, in the upper portion of parasequences, and within lags overlying sequence boundaries. As expected from their rarity, marine reptiles (ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and pliosaurs) show a weaker connection to sequence stratigraphic architecture. Nonetheless, they do display facies control and are found primarily in offshore mudstone, rather than shoreface and estuarine sandstone. They are also more common at hiatal surfaces, including a zone of concretions at the maximum flooding surface and in lag deposits overlying sequence boundaries. These associations suggest that sequence stratigraphic architecture may be a useful approach for discovery of marine vertebrates and that sequence stratigraphic context should be considered when makin...|$|R
