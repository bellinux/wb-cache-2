In this compound, which is stable at room temperature, the carbene atom {{is connected to}} two carbon atoms, in a three-member ring that retains the aromaticity and geometry of the cyclopropenylidene ring. This example demonstrated {{that the presence of}} <b>heteroatoms</b> next to the carbene is not necessary for stability, either.|$|E

25|$|Many analogues of {{pyridine}} {{are known}} where N {{is replaced by}} other <b>heteroatoms</b> (see figure below). Substitution of one C–H in pyridine with a second N {{gives rise to the}} diazine heterocycles (C4H4N2), with the names pyridazine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine.|$|E

The <b>heteroatom</b> includes boron, aluminum, nitrogen, phosphorus or arsenic which {{is either a}} IIIA Or a VA group element. The recorded time of mass spectra show that stabilities of the cluster anions {{are affected by the}} composition of the <b>heteroatom</b> The MA group <b>heteroatom</b> tends to bind with even sizes of carbon atom and the VA group atom selects odd sizes. The even (odd alternation is attributed to the linear configuration of the cluster anion s with the <b>heteroatom</b> {{at the end of the}} chain...|$|R
50|$|The <b>heteroatom</b> {{is assumed}} to have its {{standard}} bonding number for organic chemistry while the name is being constructed. The halogens have a standard bonding number of one, and so a heterocyclic ring containing a halogen as a <b>heteroatom</b> should have a formal positive charge. In principle, lambda nomenclature {{could be used to}} specify a non-standard valence state for a <b>heteroatom</b> but, in practice, this is rare.|$|R

25|$|In organic chemistry, in {{addition}} to oxidation, reduction or acid-base reactions, {{a number of other}} reactions can take place which involve covalent bonds between carbon atoms or carbon and <b>heteroatoms</b> (such as oxygen, nitrogen, halogens, etc.). Many specific reactions in organic chemistry are name reactions designated after their discoverers.|$|E
25|$|Both {{hydrogenation}} and dehydrogenation of LOHCs requires catalysts. It {{was demonstrated}} that replacing hydrocarbons by hetero-atoms, like N, O etc. improves reversible de/hydrogenation properties. The temperature required for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of drops significantly with {{increasing numbers of}} <b>heteroatoms.</b> Among all the N-heterocycles, the saturated-unsaturated pair of dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole (12H-NEC) and NEC has been considered as a promising candidate for hydrogen storage with a fairly large hydrogen content (5.8wt%). The figure on the top right shows dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of the 12H-NEC and NEC pair. The standard catalyst for NEC to 12H-NEC is Ru and Rh based. The selectivity of hydrogenation can reach 97% at 7 MPa and 130°C-150°C. Although N-Heterocyles can optimize the unfavorable thermodynamic properties of cycloalkanes, {{a lot of issues}} remain unsolved, such as high cost, high toxicity and kinetic barriers etc.|$|E
25|$|In heterocyclic {{aromatics}} (heteroaromatics), {{one or more}} of {{the atoms}} in the aromatic ring is of an element other than carbon. This can lessen the ring's aromaticity, and thus (as in the case of furan) increase its reactivity. Other examples include pyridine, pyrazine, pyrrole, imidazole, pyrazole, oxazole, thiophene, and their benzannulated analogs (benzimidazole, for example). In all these examples, the number of π-electrons is 6, due to the π-electrons from the double bonds as well as the two electrons from any lone pair that is in the p-orbital that is in the plane of the aromatic π system. For example, in pyridine, the five sp2-hybridized carbons each have a p-orbital that is perpendicular to the plane of the ring, and each of these p-orbitals contains one π-electron. Additionally, the nitrogen atom is also sp2-hybridized and has one electron in a p-orbital, which adds up to 6 p-electrons, thus making pyridine aromatic. The lone pair on the nitrogen is not part of the aromatic π system. Pyrrole and imidazole are both five membered aromatic rings that contain <b>heteroatoms.</b> In pyrrole, each of the four sp2-hybridized carbons contributes one π-electron, and the nitrogen atom is also sp2-hybridized and contributes two π-electrons from its lone pair, which occupies a p-orbital. In imidazole, both nitrogens are sp2-hybridized; the one in the double bond contributes one electron and the one which is not in the double bond and is in a lone pair contributes two electrons to the π system.|$|E
25|$|Heterocycles {{are often}} {{activated}} towards cation-π binding when the lone pair on the <b>heteroatom</b> is in {{incorporated into the}} aromatic system (e.g. indole, pyrrole). Conversely, when the lone pair does not contribute to aromaticity (e.g. pyridine), the electronegativity of the <b>heteroatom</b> wins out and weakens the cation-π binding ability.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2002 The {{effects of}} <b>heteroatom</b> (or group) {{substitution}} in several delocalized x systems are discussed. A {{brief review of}} {{the various types of}} <b>heteroatom</b> substitutions which preserve an isoelectronic valence space is presented. In the second chapter, a rationalization is presented for why silabenezene readily dimerizes, whereas the isovalent phosphabenzene does not. The next chapter is concerned with <b>heteroatom</b> substitution of the central carbon atom of trimethylenemethane radical cation and trimethylenemethane radical anion, both of which possess doublet ground states. The question addressed is whether an isovalent species with <b>heteroatom</b> substitution might have a quartet ground state.

500|$|A {{large number}} of {{organoboron}} compounds are known and many are useful in organic synthesis. Many are produced from hydroboration, which employs diborane, [...] B2H6, a simple borane chemical. Organoboron(III) compounds are usually tetrahedral or trigonal planar, for example, tetraphenylborate, − vs. triphenylborane, B(C6H5)3. However, multiple boron atoms reacting with each other {{have a tendency to}} form novel dodecahedral (12-sided) and icosahedral (20-sided) structures composed completely of boron atoms, or with varying numbers of carbon <b>heteroatoms.</b>|$|E

500|$|Hydrogen forms a {{vast array}} of {{compounds}} with carbon called the hydrocarbons, and an even vaster array with <b>heteroatoms</b> that, because of their general association with living things, are called organic compounds.

Millions of hydrocarbons are known, and they are usually formed by complicated synthetic pathways that seldom involve elementary hydrogen.|$|E
50|$|A common dynamic {{covalent}} building motif is {{bond formation}} between a carbon {{center and a}} <b>heteroatom</b> such as nitrogen or oxygen.

25|$|Heteroarenes {{can also}} undergo borylation under iridium-catalyzed conditions, however, site-selectivity {{in this case}} is {{controlled}} by electronic effects, where furans, pyroles, and thiophenes undergo reaction at the C–H bond alpha to the <b>heteroatom.</b> In this case selectivity is suggested to occur through the C–H bond alpha to the <b>heteroatom</b> because it is the most acidic C–H bond and therefore the most reactive.|$|R

2500|$|The {{characteristics}} of the cyclic hydrocarbons are again altered if <b>heteroatoms</b> are present, which can exist as either substituents attached externally to the ring (exocyclic) or {{as a member of}} the ring itself (endocyclic). In the case of the latter, the ring is termed a heterocycle. [...] Pyridine and furan are examples of aromatic heterocycles while piperidine and tetrahydrofuran are the corresponding alicyclic heterocycles. The heteroatom of heterocyclic molecules is generally oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen, with the latter being particularly common in biochemical systems.|$|E
2500|$|A cumulene is a {{hydrocarbon}} {{with three}} or more cumulative (consecutive) double bonds. They are analogous to allenes, only having a more extensive chain. The simplest molecule in this class is butatriene (H2C=C=C=CH2), which is also called simply cumulene. Unlike most alkanes and alkenes, cumulenes tend to be rigid, comparable to alkynes, which makes them appealing for molecular nanotechnology. Polyynes are another kind of rigid carbon chains. [...] Cumulenes are found in regions of space where hydrogen is rare (see astrochemistry). Cumulenes containing <b>heteroatoms</b> are called heterocumulenes; an example is carbon suboxide.|$|E
2500|$|As first {{described}} by Hartwig, alkanes can be selectively borylated with high selectivity {{for the primary}} C–H bond using Cp*Rh(η4-C6Me6) as the catalyst. Notably, selectivity for the primary C–H bond is exclusive even {{in the presence of}} <b>heteroatoms</b> in the carbon-hydrogen chain. The rhodium-catalyzed borylation of methyl C–H bonds occurs selectively without a dependence on the position of the heteroatom. Borylation occurs selectively at the least sterically hindered and least electron rich primary C–H bond in a range of acetals, ethers, amines, and alkyl fluorides. [...] Additionally, no reaction is shown to occur in the absence of primary C–H bonds, for example when cyclohexane is the substrate.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} where there is an {{electron}} activating group (EAG) near aliphatic C–H bonds, the EAG will donate electron density to the adjacent C–H bonds to promote oxidation at that site. [...] In the case at the right the cyclopropane EAG activates the aliphatic C–H bonds adjacent to it via hyperconjugation (oxygen and nitrogen <b>heteroatoms</b> can also do this). The bonds highlighted in red will undergo oxidation preferentially to other C—H bonds in the molecule. [...] The observed product is shown {{on the right and}} consists of a carbonyl in place of the two aliphatic C–H bonds. Other oxidants such as TFDO and DMDO have also been shown to oxidize aliphatic C—H bonds selectively via stereoelectronic activation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{functional}} groups is central in organic chemistry, {{both as a}} means to classify structures and for predicting properties. [...] A functional group is a molecular module, and the reactivity of that functional group is assumed, within limits, to be the same in a variety of molecules. Functional groups can have decisive influence on the chemical and physical properties of organic compounds. Molecules are classified {{on the basis of their}} functional groups. Alcohols, for example, all have the subunit C-O-H. All alcohols tend to be somewhat hydrophilic, usually form esters, and usually can be converted to the corresponding halides. [...] Most functional groups feature <b>heteroatoms</b> (atoms other than C and H). Organic compounds are classified according to functional groups, alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines, etc.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} useful {{chemical}} properties of n-BuLi {{is its ability to}} deprotonate a wide range of weak Brønsted acids. [...] t-Butyllithium and s-butyllithium are more basic. n-BuLi can deprotonate (that is, metalate) many types of C-H bonds, especially where the conjugate base is [...] stabilized by electron delocalization or one or more <b>heteroatoms</b> (non carbon atoms). [...] Examples include acetylenes (H-CC-R), methyl sulfides (H-CH2SR), thioacetals (H-CH(SR)2, e.g. dithiane), methylphosphines [...] (H-CH2PR2), furans, thiophenes and ferrocene (Fe(H-C5H4)(C5H5)). In addition to these, it will also deprotonate all more acidic compounds such as alcohols, amines, enolizable carbonyl compounds, and any overtly acidic compounds, to produce alkoxides, amides, enolates and other -ates of lithium, respectively. The stability and volatility of the butane resulting from such deprotonation reactions is convenient, but can also be a problem for large-scale reactions because of the volume of a flammable gas produced.|$|E
5000|$|One {{consequence}} of this natural polarization of molecules is that 1,3- and 1,5- <b>heteroatom</b> substituted carbon skeletons are extremely easy to synthesize (Aldol reaction, Claisen condensation, Michael reaction, Claisen rearrangement, Diels-Alder reaction), whereas 1,2-, 1,4-, and 1,6- <b>heteroatom</b> substitution patterns {{are more difficult to}} access via [...] "normal" [...] reactivity.

Task-specific semi-organic crystals combine functions for three different purposes: the carbon and <b>heteroatom</b> source, a foaming agent (CO 2) and an in situ generable template (NaCl). Insights to the decomposition pathway were gained through FTIR/MS coupled TGA and an ultrafast out-of-furnace heating procedure and the products were analysed with (HR) SEM/TEM, EELS, FTIR, and N 2 sorption. The resulting macroporous carbon foams are excellent supports for metallic nanoparticles due to their hierarchical structure, high surface area and tuneable <b>heteroatom</b> contents.

50|$|Azoles are a {{class of}} five-membered heterocyclic {{compounds}} containing a nitrogen atom {{and at least one}} other non-carbon atom (i.e. nitrogen, sulfur, or oxygen) as part of the ring.

One, and only one, lone pair of electrons from each <b>heteroatom</b> in the ring is part of the aromatic bonding in an azole. Names of azoles maintain the prefix upon reduction (e.g., pyrazoline, pyrazolidine). The numbering of ring atoms in azoles starts with the <b>heteroatom</b> that is not part of a double bond, and then proceeds towards the other <b>heteroatom.</b>|$|R
