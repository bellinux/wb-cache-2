In the first half, Eden Hazard gave Chelsea the lead, later doubled by a Filipe Luís free kick, the full-back's first for Chelsea.

In November 2005, Hawass suggested a three-month loan of the Rosetta Stone, while reiterating the eventual <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> permanent return. In December 2009, he proposed to drop his claim for the permanent return of the Rosetta Stone if the British Museum lent the stone to Egypt for three months for the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum at Giza in 2013. These requests were refused.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E

Villagers can be swayed by everything from assistance with day-to-day tasks to being terrorised by fireballs and lightning storms. Artefacts (special objects that glow in their owner's colour) and missionary disciples can be used to impress villagers. Villagers become bored with repetitive attempts to impress them. For example, if boulders fly overhead too frequently, their effect is lost. This forces the player to use multiple methods to convert a village.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'í teachings are in {{some ways}} similar to other monotheistic faiths: God is {{considered}} single and all-powerful. However, Bahá'u'lláh taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through Manifestations of God who are the founders of major world religions throughout history; Buddha, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. As such, Bahá'ís regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose, though varied in social practices and interpretations. There is a similar emphasis on the unity of all people, openly rejecting notions of racism and nationalism. At the heart of Bahá'í teachings is the <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> unified world order that ensures the prosperity of all nations, races, creeds, and classes.|$|E

5|$|Donaldson {{was called}} {{up by the}} England National Game XI, who {{represent}} England at non-League level, for a European Challenge Trophy match against Belgium in November 2005. He was named in the initial 35-man squad for the Four Nations Tournament in May 2006, but {{did not make the}} final 18-man squad. Donaldson finally made the cut when being named in the final 16-man squad for the team to play the Netherlands in November 2006. He made his debut in this match, coming on as a substitute in the last 15 minutes, in which he set up Craig Mackail-Smith for the final <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 4–1 victory. Donaldson was included in the squad to play Northern Ireland in February 2007, although York manager McEwan contemplated withdrawing Donaldson from the squad, after his comeback for York against Altrincham in February 2007. Donaldson eventually started against Northern Ireland, but was substituted after 50 minutes for Paul Benson, who scored England's only goal two minutes after coming on in a 3–1 defeat. This was the final of two caps he earned for England National Game XI.|$|E

The following month Brandon scored the only <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 1–0 win over non-league Worcester City in the FA Cup second round to earn Huddersfield a tie with Premiership champions Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Two days later, Brandon received another red card, as both he and David Mirfin were sent off {{in the final minute}} of a 2–2 draw with Milton Keynes Dons.

5|$|In 1787, Hamilton {{served as}} assemblyman from New York County in the New York State Legislature and {{was chosen as}} a {{delegate}} for the Constitutional Convention by his father-in-law Philip Schuyler. Even though Hamilton had {{been a leader in}} calling for a new Constitutional Convention, his direct influence at the Convention itself was quite limited. Governor George Clinton's faction in the New York legislature had chosen New York's other two delegates, John Lansing, Jr. and Robert Yates, and both of them opposed Hamilton's <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strong national government. Thus, whenever the other two members of the New York delegation were present, they decided New York's vote, to ensure that there were no major alterations to the Articles of Confederation.|$|E
