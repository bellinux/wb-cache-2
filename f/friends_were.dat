5|$|His {{resting place}} {{is at the}} Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery, in Pyongyang.

According to Gabroussenko, Cho's untimely death in 1951 may have spared him his reputation from that loss of official recognition. With the exception of a period in the 1970s when Cho's name was barely mentioned in official publications, his legacy has benefited from continued popularity in North Korea.|$|E
