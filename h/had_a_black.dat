5|$|All matches of the Campeonato Brasileiro 2007 {{started with}} a minute of silence, while all players wore black armbands. Brazilian Formula One driver Felipe Massa <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> stripe {{on top of his}} helmet during the 2007 European Grand Prix, to commemorate the victims. Rubens Barrichello also had stripes on his helmet, and the two Red Bull Racing drivers David Coulthard and Mark Webber had small Brazilian flags on their helmets {{referring}} to the accident.|$|E
5|$|The non-streamlined Nos. 6230–6234 {{were painted}} {{in a special}} version of the {{standard}} crimson lake livery. The locomotives were lined out in gold bordered with fine red lines. Serif lettering and numerals in gold leaf and vermillion shading were applied. Handrails and sundry small external fittings were chrome-plated, as were the nameplates, which <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> background.|$|E
5|$|Chester Rock Light was a {{light in}} Chester, Connecticut on the Connecticut River. It was built in 1889 {{as part of a}} $15,000 {{appropriation}} by the United States Congress. The 21-foot (6.4 meter) tall wooden hexagonal pyramidal tower <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> lantern with a 6th order Fresnel lens. The light was first lit on July 1, 1889. The tower was replaced in 1912 by a skeleton tower that was subsequently modified in 1927. Records do not show the deactivation or destruction of the light, but it was believed to have been removed in the 1930s. In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut wanted to build a replica of the structure for use as a daymark.|$|E
50|$|The sleepy orange <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> forewing cell {{spot on the}} upperside, the upperside of the hindwing <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> {{marginal}} border, and the hindwing is not pointed.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 30 mm. The wings are white with broad black margins. The forewings <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> line along the costa and the hindwings <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> {{spot on the}} costa.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} muriqui, B. arachnoides, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> solid <b>black</b> face, distinguishing it {{from the}} northern species, B. hypoxanthus, which <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> face mottled with pink.|$|R
5|$|The {{day after}} the violence; flowers, scarves and shirts were laid outside the Elland Road gates in tribute. The statue of former Leeds United captain Billy Bremner which was outside the stadium also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> armband placed on it {{as a symbol of}} the club mourning. Leeds United {{installed}} a brass plaque in Elland Road to remember those who had been killed in the violence. Leeds' Premier League match against Arsenal the Sunday before the second leg was marked by Arsenal players laying flowers at all four corners of Elland Road and a minute's silence being held before the match started in respect for the death of the two Leeds fans.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} fourth batches of {{streamlined}} locomotives, Nos. 6225–6229 and 6235–6244, were painted in crimson lake, with banding in gold lined with vermilion and black. Nameplates <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> background. LMS shop grey was carried briefly in service on No. 6229 Duchess of Hamilton from 7 September 1938 until its return to Crewe Works later that year. It was then painted crimson lake and disguised as No. 6220, {{in preparation for the}} 1939 visit to the New York World's Fair. Lettering and numerals for both Caledonian blue and crimson lake liveries were in a newly created style of unshaded sans-serif.|$|E
5|$|The {{vehicles}} of each patrol adopted their own markings. The New Zealand 'R' Patrol used a green Hei-tiki {{with a red}} tongue painted {{on the right side}} of the bonnet of the vehicle, and on the left a Māori place name beginning with the letter 'R' (for example, 'Rotowaro'). The 'T' Patrol vehicles <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> Kiwi over green 'grass' and a Māori name starting with 'Te' (for example, 'Te Anau') in the corresponding places. The 'W' Patrol vehicles had a Māori name or word starting with 'W' painted on their vehicles.|$|E

5|$|After a {{successful}} (8–1–1) football season in 1955, Tech {{was invited to}} play in the 1956 Sugar Bowl in New Orleans against the University of Pittsburgh. It would be the school's fifth straight bowl appearance under renowned coach Bobby Dodd. Pittsburgh <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> starting player, fullback Bobby Grier, but as Tech had played a 1953 game against a desegregated Notre Dame team, and the University of Georgia had very recently played out-of-state games against desegregated opponents, president Van Leer and the Tech Athletic Association saw the game's contract as acceptable. However, racial tension in the South was high following the recent Brown v. Board of Education decision. Georgia Governor Marvin Griffin had privately given Dodd his support, but he surprised the campus and the state on Friday, December 2, 1955 by bowing to pressure from segregationists and sending a wire to the Georgia Board of Regents chairman, Robert O. Arnold, requesting not only that Tech not play the game, but that all University System of Georgia teams play only segregated games.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{competition}} {{as varied as}} television and football, baseball attendance at all levels declined. While the majors rebounded by the mid-1950s, the minor leagues were gutted and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams dissolved. Integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> player on the roster. That year, the Major League Baseball Players Association was founded. It was the first professional baseball union to survive more than briefly, but it remained largely ineffective for years. No major league team had been located west of St. Louis until 1958, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. The majors' final all-white bastion, the Boston Red Sox, added a black player in 1959. With {{the integration of the}} majors drying up the available pool of players, the last Negro league folded the following year. In 1961, the American League reached the West Coast with the Los Angeles Angels expansion team, and the major league season was extended from 154 games to 162. This coincidentally helped Roger Maris break Babe Ruth's long-standing single-season home run record, one of the most celebrated marks in baseball. Along with the Angels, three other new franchises were launched during 1961–62. With this, the first major league expansion in 60 years, each league now had ten teams.|$|E

25|$|To {{celebrate}} the Bicentennial celebrations in 1988, new vehicle registrations received plates from YRS-000 to YSP-999 that <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> {{outline of the}} new Parliament House in the middle, flanked by 1788 {{on the left and}} 1988 on the right. As these special plates become evermore rarer, they are sought after and particularly valuable. Remakes have been done in current embossing style.|$|E
500|$|The English-language {{place name}} [...] "Black Swan" [...] occurs as a {{descriptive}} toponym in four states, usually as a [...] "name cluster". Queensland <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Creek near Gladstone, together with nearby Black Swan Island and <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Rock further south near Shoalwater Bay; another Black Swan Creek near Maryborough; and <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Lagoon inland on the Darling Downs near Warwick. New South Wales <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Anabranch adjoining <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Lagoon {{on the north}} side of the Murray River in the Corowa Shire. In South Australia's arid north, there is <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Swamp just north of Roxby Downs and <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Waterhole further north of the old Overland Telegraph line. Tasmania <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Island near the wild South West Cape. Given the broad sweep of the black swan's natural habitat, the presence of only nine distinctive place names or name clusters within that range indicates the rarity of [...] "Black Swan" [...] as a toponym. New Zealand also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Stream in the South Auckland district.|$|R

25|$|As of 2000, Central Harlem <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> {{community}} comprising 77% of the population; {{however, the}} black population is declining as many African Americans moved out {{as more and more}} immigrants began to move in. Central Harlem is the most famous section of Harlem and thus is commonly referred to simply as Harlem. Central Harlem is home to the famous Apollo Theater.|$|E
25|$|Tallahassee has {{traditionally}} been a Democratic city, {{and is one of}} the few cities in the South known for progressive activism. It has <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> mayor and black state representative. The city has voted Democratic throughout its history with a high voter-turnout. As of April 2007, there were 85,343 Democrats and 42,230 Republicans in Leon County. Other affiliations accounted for 22,284 voters.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, music {{producer}} Phil Spector {{conducted the}} band at {{a show in}} San Francisco where the Righteous Brothers was also appearing, and he was impressed enough with the duo to want them to record for his own label Philles Records. All the songs previously produced by Spector for Philles Records featured black singers, and the Righteous Brothers would become his first white vocal group. However they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> vocal style, termed blue-eyed soul, that suited Spector.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a medium}} large grosbeak {{with a large}} bill. The male <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> head and bright yellow upper parts. The female is less brightly {{coloured}} and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> smaller <b>black</b> cap.|$|R
50|$|The {{village weaver}} is a stocky 15-17 cm bird {{with a strong}} conical bill and dark reddish eyes. In the {{northern}} part of its range, the breeding male <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> head edged by chestnut (typically most distinct on the nape and chest). Towards the southern part of its range, the amount of black and chestnut diminish, and the breeding males of the southernmost subspecies only <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> face and throat, while the nape and crown are yellow. In all subspecies the breeding male <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> bill, black and yellow upperparts and wings, and yellow underparts.|$|R

25|$|The {{closing credits}} for the {{programme}} varied series by series. The first series used peeling labels featuring {{the names of}} the cast and crew, mirroring the opening sequence, but these had to be updated with every new episode, making the process very time-consuming; from the second series the credits switched to a standard rolling format. The third series featured additional symbols. For the fourth series, these designs were replaced with white lettering on a black background. The fifth series <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> and white background, but the sixth series reverted to the black one. For the seventh series, the credits scrolled against a freeze frame of the final scene.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they had}} {{acquired}} some immunity in their homeland, Africans were {{more resistant to}} these tropical fevers than were the Europeans. As the rice industry was developed, planters continued to import African slaves. By about 1708, South Carolina <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> majority. Coastal Georgia developed a black majority after rice cultivation expanded there in the mid-18th century. Malaria and yellow fever became endemic. Fearing these diseases, many white planters and their families left the Lowcountry during the rainy spring and summer months when fevers ran rampant. Others lived mostly {{in cities such as}} Charleston rather than on the isolated plantations, especially those on the Sea Islands.|$|E
25|$|The {{general manager}} {{who would be}} {{eventually}} successful in breaking the color barrier was Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Rickey himself had experienced the issue of segregation. While playing and coaching for his college team at Ohio Wesleyan University, Rickey <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> teammate named Charles Thomas. On one particular road trip through southern Ohio his fellow player was refused a room in a hotel. Although Rickey {{was able to get}} the player into his room for that night, he was taken aback when he reached his room to find Thomas upset and crying about this injustice. Rickey related this incident as an example of why he wanted a full de-segregation of the nation, not only in baseball.|$|E
