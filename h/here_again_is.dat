25|$|Selah {{is used in}} Iyaric Rastafarian vocabulary. It can {{be heard}} {{at the end of}} spoken-word {{segments}} of some reggae songs. Its usage <b>here,</b> <b>again,</b> <b>is</b> to accentuate the magnitude and importance of what has been said, and often is a sort of substitute for Amen. Notable, according to Rastafarian faith, is also the word's similarity with the incarnated god and savior Selassie (Ethiopia's former emperor Haile Selassie).|$|E
25|$|Producing {{deuterium}} by fission is also difficult. The problem <b>here</b> <b>again</b> <b>is</b> that deuterium is {{very unlikely}} due to nuclear processes, and that collisions between atomic nuclei {{are likely to}} result either in the fusion of the nuclei, or in the release of free neutrons or alpha particles. During the 1970s, cosmic ray spallation was proposed {{as a source of}} deuterium. That theory failed to account for the abundance of deuterium, but led to explanations of the source of other light elements.|$|E
2500|$|The Double Cube Room: The {{great room}} of the house. It is , [...] and [...] It was created by Inigo Jones and Webb circa 1653. The pine walls, painted white, are {{decorated}} with great swags of foliage and fruit in gold leaf. The gilt and red velvet furniture complements the collection of paintings by Van Dyck {{of the family of}} Charles I and the family of his contemporary Earl of Pembroke. Between the windows are mirrors by Chippendale and console tables by William Kent. The coffered ceiling, painted by Thomas de Critz, depicts the story of Perseus. <b>Here</b> <b>again</b> <b>is</b> another anomaly which makes one question the true involvement of Jones: [...] the great Venetian window, centrepiece of the south front and centrepiece of the double cube room, is not the dead centre of the room's outer wall; [...] the other windows in the room are not symmetrically placed; [...] and the central fireplace and Venetian window are not opposite each other as the proportions of a room designed as an architectural feature in itself would demand.|$|E

It is not a simple European view which makes honest Doubt worth a dozen of the Creeds. And it is in direct opposition to the noted writer who holds that the man of simple faith is worth ninety-nine of those who hold only to the egotistic interests of their own individuality. This dark saying means (if it mean anything), that the so-called moral faculties of man, fancy and ideality, must lord it over the perceptive and reflective powers,a simple absurdity! It produced a Turricremata, alias Torquemada, who, shedding floods of honest tears, caused his victims to be burnt alive; and an Anchieta, the Thaumaturgist of Brazil, who beheaded a converted heretic lest the latter by lapse from grace lose his immortal soul.|$|E

Bouille walks trustfully towards the Regiment de Salm, speaks trustful words; but <b>here</b> <b>again</b> <b>is</b> answered by the cry of forty-four thousand livres odd sous. A cry waxing more and more vociferous, as Salm's humour mounts; which cry, as it will produce no cash or promise of cash, ends in the wide simultaneous whirr of shouldered muskets, and a determined quick-time march on the part of Salm--towards its Colonel's house, in the next street, there to seize the colours and military chest. Thus does Salm, for its part; strong in the faith that meum is not tuum, that fair speeches are not forty-four thousand livres odd sous.|$|E

Now, <b>here</b> <b>again</b> <b>is</b> the duplicate Wulfric--permit me to call it your Wulfric; and if you will compare the two you'll find, I think, that though your Wulfric is a great deal smaller than the original one, taken as a whole, yet on one diameter, the diameter from the letter U in Wulfric to the letter R in Rex, it is nearly an eighth of an inch broader than the specimen I have there figured. Well, sir, you may cut as much as you like off a coin, and make it smaller; but hang me if by cutting away at it for all your lifetime you can make it an eighth of an inch broader anyhow, in any direction." ...|$|E
60|$|Within this scheme, {{which makes}} the State {{the source of all}} energy, and the final legatee, what will be the nature of the {{property}} a man may own? Under modern conditions--indeed, under any conditions--a man without some negotiable property is a man without freedom, and the extent of his property is very largely the measure of his freedom. Without any property, without even shelter or food, a man {{has no choice but to}} set about getting these things; he is in servitude to his needs until he has secured property to satisfy them. But with a certain small property a man is free to do many things, to take a fortnight's holiday when he chooses, for example, and to try this new departure from his work or that; with so much more, he may take a year of freedom and go to the ends of the earth; with so much more, he may obtain elaborate apparatus and try curious novelties, build himself houses and make gardens, establish businesses and make experiments at large. Very speedily, under terrestrial conditions, the property of a man may reach such proportions that his freedom oppresses the freedom of others. <b>Here,</b> <b>again,</b> <b>is</b> a quantitative question, an adjustment of conflicting freedoms, a quantitative question that too many people insist on making a qualitative one.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Here,</b> <b>again,</b> <b>is</b> an Elephant story {{which is}} almost as tough as the animal's hide, {{but we have no}} right to disbelieve it, for it is told by very respectable writers. During the war between the East Indian natives and the English, in 1858, there was an Elephant named Kudabar Moll the Second,--his mother having been a noted Elephant named Kudabar Moll. This animal belonged to the British army, and his duty was to carry a cannon on his back. In this way he became very {{familiar}} with artillery. During a battle, when his cannon was posted on a battery, and was blazing away at the enemy, the good Kudabar was standing, according to custom, a few paces {{in the rear of the}} gunners. But the fire became very hot on that battery, and very soon most of the gunners were shot down, so that there was no one to pass the cartridges from the ammunition wagon to the artillery-men. Perceiving this, Kudabar, without being ordered, took the cartridges from the wagon, and passed them, one by one, to the gunner. Very soon, however, there were only three men left, and these, just as they had loaded their cannon for another volley, fell killed or wounded, almost at the same moment. One of them, who held a lighted match in his hand, called as he fell to the Elephant and handed him the match. The intelligent Kudabar took the match in his trunk, stepped up to the cannon, and fired it off! ...|$|E

Yes, but great art is popular, as bread and water are to children fed by a father. And vile art is popular, as poisonous jelly is, to children cheated by a confectioner. And {{it is quite possible}} to make any kind of art popular on those last terms. The color school may become just as poisonous as the colorless, in the hands of fools, or of rogues. Here is a book I bought only the other day,--one of the things got up cheap to catch the eyes of mothers at bookstalls,--Puss in Boots, illustrated; a most definite work of the color school--red jackets and white paws and yellow coaches as distinct as Giotto or Raphael would have kept them. But the thing is done by fools for money, and becomes entirely monstrous and abominable. <b>Here,</b> <b>again,</b> <b>is</b> color art produced by fools for religion: here is Indian sacred painting,--a black god with a hundred arms, with a green god on one side of him and a red god on the other; still a most definite work of the color school. Giotto or Raphael could not have made the black more resolutely black, (though the whole color of the school of Athens is kept in distinct separation from one black square in it), nor the green more unquestionably green. Yet the whole is pestilent and loathsome.|$|E
6000|$|Half of the Minotaur is gone {{to shreds}} in this manner; but the attack upon it, too, is spent: {{what is to}} be done with the other half of the monster, which is again alive; which still stands, and polypus-like has {{arranged}} a new life for itself, a new front against the Galgengrund yonder? Friedrich brings his right wing into action. Rapidly arranges right wing, centre, all of the left that is disposable, with batteries, with cavalry; for an attack on the opposite or southeastern end of his monster. If your monster, polypus-like, come alive again in the tail-part, you must fell that other head of him. Batteries, well in advance, begin work upon the new head of the monster, which was once his tail; fresh troops, long lines of them, pushing forward to begin platoon-volleying:--time now, I should guess, about half-past two. Our infantry has not yet got within musket-range,--when torrents of Russian Horse, Foot too following, plunge out; wide-flowing, stormfully swift; and dash against the coming attack. Dash against it; stagger it; actually tumble it back, in the centre part; take one of the batteries, and a whole battalion prisoners. <b>Here</b> <b>again</b> <b>is</b> a moment! Friedrich, they say, rushed personally into this vortex; rallied these broken battalions, again rallied and led them up; but it was to no purpose: they could not be made to stand, these centre battalions;--"some sudden panic in them, a thing unaccountable," [...] says Tempelhof; [...] "they are Dohna's people, who fought perfectly at Jagersdorf, and often elsewhere" [...] (they were all in such a finely burnished state the other day; but have not biting talent, like the grass-devils): enough, they fairly scour away, certain disgraceful battalions, and are not got ranked again till below Wilkersdorf, above a mile off; though the grass-devils, on both hands of them, stand grimly steady, left in this ominous manner.|$|E
