According to anomaly literature, lower analyst forecast dispersion has been found to induce higher excess return, which our data supports <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Swiss <b>stock</b> <b>market.</b> By linking variance of earnings per share, analyst forecast dispersion and stock performance we provide an insightful explanation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> excess <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> returns of family firms.
