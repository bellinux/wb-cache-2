5|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} a sustainable development of ethanol production, in September 2009 the government issued by decree a countrywide agroecological land use zoning to restrict sugarcane growth in or near environmentally sensitive areas. According to the new criteria, 92.5% of the Brazilian territory is not suitable for sugarcane plantation. The government considers that the suitable areas are more than <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the future demand for ethanol and sugar in the domestic and international markets foreseen for the next decades.|$|E
5|$|Since {{electrical}} energy cannot easily {{be stored in}} quantities large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses.|$|E
5|$|In 1566, {{the capital}} city of Valletta was founded on the Sciberras Peninsula, which did not have a good water supply. Rainwater {{collected}} within the city was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the needs of its population. Water had to be carted from springs to the city, but this became difficult {{by the end of the}} 16th century, when the city had become the largest settlement in Malta. At the time, there were also fears of an Ottoman attack on Malta, so a steady water supply to the capital was a priority for the military authorities in the case of a siege.|$|E

5|$|The Mint struck 500 million {{coins in}} {{anticipation}} of considerable public demand, but the Susan B. Anthony dollar was poorly received, {{in part because of}} confusion caused by its similarity in size and metallic composition to the quarter. Despite its poor reception, the coins eventually began seeing use in vending machines and mass transit systems, gradually depleting the surplus. In 1997, Congress passed a law authorizing the mintage of a new gold-colored one dollar coin depicting Sacagawea, but production could not begin quickly <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> demand. As a stopgap measure, until the new Sacagawea dollar coin could be issued, the Susan B. Anthony dollar was struck again in 1999 after an eighteen year hiatus; the series was retired the following year.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being an}} internationally {{successful}} film, Let the Right One In was not submitted by Sweden for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The details surrounding the film's eligibility for the award resulted in some confusion. Being released on 24 October 2008, the film {{would normally be}} eligible for submission for the 82nd Academy Awards. However, the producers decided to release it on 24 September as a seven-day limited run only in Luleå. This would be exactly <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the criteria for the 81st Academy Awards instead. When the Swedish Film Institute on 16 September announced that Jan Troell's Everlasting Moments had been selected instead of Let the Right One In, the Luleå screenings were cancelled. Despite {{the fact that the}} film was released within the eligibility period for the 82nd Academy Awards, it wasn't among the films considered because the Swedish Film Institute doesn't allow a film to be considered twice.|$|E

25|$|The only {{currency}} strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> {{the rising}} demands for international currency transactions was the U.S. dollar. The {{strength of the}} U.S. economy, the fixed relationship of the dollar to gold ($35 an ounce), and {{the commitment of the}} U.S. government to convert dollars into gold at that price made the dollar as good as gold. In fact, the dollar was even better than gold: it earned interest and it was more flexible than gold.|$|E
25|$|The {{strike was}} the nation's first statewide strike keeping more than 40 percent of Florida {{teachers}} at home.

40|$|This report {{uses the}} Self-Sufficiency Standard {{developed}} by Dr. Diana Pearce at the University of Washington {{to analyze the}} extent to which Oregon households earn <b>enough</b> money <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> their basic needs without a public subsidy. This standard, a vast improvement on the federal poverty level, accounts for differences in the cost of living based on family structure, age of children, and county of residence. Dr. Pearce has defined the income required <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> basic needs for every county in Oregon and a number of household types. A large number of Oregon households not considered poor by the federal poverty level nevertheless do not earn <b>enough</b> income <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> their basic needs. In this report, we use census data to sort households into those that meet versus those that don’t meet the Self-Sufficiency Standard and describe how basic socioeconomic factors such as family structure and householder sex, race/ethnicity, education, and work affect {{the extent to which}} households earn <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make ends <b>meet...</b>|$|R

While they work on other items such as tablecloths and other items of clothing, the most popular and most valued remains the huipil.

The 11th Air Assault Division (Test) was activated in February 1963 specifically to test the concept, and its commander (Major General Harry Kinnard) was given a great deal of control over the unit's organization and training (from selecting officers for command positions to an almost unlimited budget and scope of operations). Over the next two years, Kinnard's division conducted a number of exercises and maneuvers to demonstrate that airmobility was practical and flexible <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the vision of the board's final report.|$|E
25|$|The company's {{proposed}} routes {{were not}} comprehensive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the corporation's aspirations, so they built two further lines. One was an extension from Milehouse to Peverell, {{the other was}} a line from Camel's Head to Saltash Passage. This was not initially connected to the line from Morice Town as the wooden bridge across Camel's Head Creek was not able to accommodate tram lines, so a small depot was provided at Camel's Head. The corporation leased its lines to the Devonport and District company in 1903. The company opened a tea room at Little Ash near Saltash Passage and offered round-trip tickets, with the journey to the tea room being by tram in one direction and by boat in the other.|$|E

While once common, they are now typically only worn when engaged in traditional outdoor sports, such as shooting or golf. The length and design is closely related to the plus-fours (and plus-sixes etc.) worn for sport, but differ in having no bagginess.
