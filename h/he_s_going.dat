The assumptions {{that we make}} {{are the same as}} the Black-Scholes ones and the resulting pricing equations are Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type equations or parabolic free boundary PDE's which can be solved via finite difference methods. 1 1 Introduction: the Vanilla Passport Option The Passport Option is {{an insurance}} against trading loss. The noteholder is allowed to `trade' a particular asset (of price S) during the life of the Option, T. The number of assets he 'holds' at a particular time t is denoted q and can be positive (if the noteholder thinks the asset price is going to go up) or negative (if <b>he</b> thinks <b>S</b> is <b>going</b> to go down). There is however a constraint (specified in the contract) on q, this is the position limit C: jqj C. So q can be any value in [; C] and it is the noteholder who decide [...] ...|$|R

There is overlap with the NRQM work and the semigroup work. Perhaps {{the most important of these}} results are the Trotter–Kato theorems (discussed below briefly after Theorem 3.7) and the definition of fractional powers for generators of (not necessarily self-adjoint) semigroups. There are also connections between quantum statistical mechanics and contraction semigroup on operator algebras. To keep this review within bounds, we will not discuss this work.|$|R
