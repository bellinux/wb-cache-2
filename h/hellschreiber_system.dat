5000|$|FuG120/FuG120k Bernhard: The [...] "Bernhard/Bernhardine" [...] {{system was}} a nightfighter/day fighter radio-navigation system. Primary {{intended}} to guide fighters into the bomber streams rather than against individual aircraft. The ground station (FuSAn 724/725) [...] "Bernhard" [...] was the VHF rotating directional-beacon ground-station. It continuously transmitted the station identifier and the antenna azimuth (bearing) in Hellschreiber-format. The FuG 120 [...] "Bernhardine" [...] was the airborne <b>Hellschreiber</b> <b>system</b> that prints the data stream from the selected Bernhard station. The HF receiver {{for the system}} was the EBL3 from the FuBL 2 ILS system. Operating Frequency: 30 - 33.1 MHz, Transmitter power: 2 × 500 Watt (FuSAn 724) or 2 x 5000 Watt (FuSAn 725). Antenna rotational speed: 12 degrees per second (2 revolutions per minute). Accuracy: initially ±1°, then improved to ±0.5°. The system was initially deployed in 1941/42 however work was stopped until 1944. Deployment was started to try and produce a [...] "jam proof" [...] system. A later version (deployed at about 3 sites) alternated between sending angular information and text message instructions which allowed a simple form of data link between the fighter direction stations and the fighters. FuG 120k: This version was developed as the original unit was bulky and expensive. In return for considerable reduction is size and weight azimuth measurement was reduced to approx. 4 degrees.|$|E
