40|$|Macroscopic {{emission}} models use {{average speed}} as a sole traffic-related explanatory variable. Research, however, {{has demonstrated that}} the use of average speed as a single traffic-related explanatory variable is insufficient in estimating vehicle emissions. The objective {{of this paper is to}} attempt to quantify, using simple examples, the impact of vehicle stops on fuel consumption and emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. This study indicates that the vehicle fuel consumption rate is more sensitive to cruise speed levels than to vehicle stops. The aggressiveness of a vehicle stop, as represented by the vehicle's acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>level,</b> does have a significant impact on vehicle emission rates. Specifically, HC and CO emission rates are highly sensitive to the level of acceleration when compared to cruise speeds in the range of 10 to 120 km/h. Alternatively, the impact of <b>deceleration</b> <b>levels</b> on all measures of effectiveness is relatively small. Noteworthy is the fact that at high speeds the introduction of vehicle stops involving extremely mild <b>deceleration</b> and acceleration <b>levels</b> can actually reduce vehicle emission rates...|$|R

40|$|The figure {{depicts the}} aspects of a {{proposed}} deceleration-limiting design for crash walls {{at the sides of}} racetracks and highways. The proposal is intended to overcome the disadvantages of both rigid barriers and kinetic-energy-absorbing barriers of prior design. Rigid barriers can keep high-speed crashing motor vehicles from leaving roadways and thereby prevent injury to nearby persons and objects, but they can also subject the occupants of the vehicles to <b>deceleration</b> <b>levels</b> high enough to cause injury or death. Kinetic-energy-absorbing barriers of prior design reduce <b>deceleration</b> <b>levels</b> somewhat, but are not designed to soften impacts optimally; moreover, some of them allow debris to bounce back onto roadways or onto roadside areas, and, in cases of glancingly incident vehicles, some of them can trap the vehicles in such a manner as to cause more injury than would occur if the vehicles were allowed to skid along the rigid barriers. The proposed crash walls would (1) allow tangentially impacting vehicles to continue sliding along the racetrack without catching them, (2) catch directly impacting vehicles to prevent them from injuring nearby persons and objects, and (3) absorb kinetic energy in a more nearly optimum way to limit <b>decelerations</b> to <b>levels</b> that human occupants could survive...|$|R
40|$|The latest {{braking system}} {{architectures}} for Hybrid (HEV) and Full Electric Vehicles (EV) feature {{the adoption of}} the X-by-wire solutions, namely electro-hydraulic (EHB) and electro-mechanical (EMB) braking systems, aimed at providing additional flexibility to the distinctive functions of brake blending and regeneration. Regenerative brakes still need to be supported by conventional friction brakes because of failures occurrence, fully-charged battery conditions, and unexpected variations of the tire-road friction coefficient. In order to achieve a smooth coordinated action between the regenerative and the conventional friction brakes, the brake linings coefficient of friction (BLCF) needs to be monitored. The main contribution of this work lies on the estimation of the BLCF using a tire-model-less approach. In particular, two different observer designs are proposed and compared. Whereas the proposed approach does not rely on any fixed tire modelization, the state estimation is robust against variations in the road friction characteristics and tire uncertainties caused by inflating pressure variations, wear, and aging. The functionality of the developed observers is tested in IPG CarMaker® by employing an experimentally validated EV, equipped with four onboard motors and an EHB system. Braking events are simulated at different <b>deceleration</b> <b>levels</b> on both dry and wet surfaces. Finally, the compensation function against variations in the BLCF is implemented in the EHB controller to achieve constant <b>deceleration</b> <b>levels.</b> Authors envisage that the precise knowledge of the BLCF will contribute to enhance the braking performance and to actively monitor the brake pad wear under different working conditions...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{show that}} {{the proper design of}} {{clearance}} intervals has significant implications for intersection safety.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper quantifies and models the impact of wet pavement surface and rainy weather conditions on driver perception-reaction times (PRTs), <b>deceleration</b> <b>levels,</b> and traffic signal change interval durations. A total of 648 stop-run records were collected as part of the research effort for a 72 km/h (45 mi/h) approach speed where participant drivers encountered a yellow indication initiation at different distances from the intersection. The participant drivers were randomly selected in different age groups (under 40 years old, 40 to 59 years old, and 60 years of age or older) and genders (female and male). Using the gathered data, statistical models for driver PRT and <b>deceleration</b> <b>levels</b> were developed, considering roadway surface and environmental parameters, driver attributes (age and gender), roadway grade, approaching speed, and time and distance to the intersection at the onset of yellow. Inclement weather yellow timings were then developed and summarized in lookup tables as a function of different factors (driver age/gender, roadway grade, speed limit, precipitation level, and roadway surface condition) to provide practical guidelines for the design of yellow signal timings in wet and rainy weather conditions. The results indicate that wet roadway surface conditions require a 5 percent increase in the change interval and that rainy conditions require a 10 percent or more increase in the duration of the change interval. These recommended change durations can also be integrated within the Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) initiative to provide customizable driver warnings prior to a transition to a red indication...|$|R

40|$|Beginning with {{excavations}} {{during the}} 1970 s, Vindija Cave (Croatia) has yielded significant Middle and Upper Paleolithic fossil and archaeological finds. We report on seven recently identified hominid fossils, a newly associated partial hominid cranial vault from <b>level</b> <b>G</b> 3, nine possible bone retouchers, and a revised {{interpretation of the}} Mousterian artifact assemblage from the site. This new information reinforces {{our knowledge of the}} complex biocultural phenomena revealed in unit G and earlier deposits at Vindija. Six of the new hominid fossils derive from stratigraphic units G and I, while one lacks exact provenience. All specimens preserving diagnostic anatomy are from Neandertals. One of the postcranial remains, a radius fragment which exhibits Neandertal-like anatomy, comes from <b>level</b> <b>G</b> 1 and is congruent with the previously established association of Neandertals with an early Upper Paleolithic industry at the site. The partial cranial vault represents the most complete Neandertal from Vindija. The possible retouchers derive from unit G.

30|$|The {{average in}} service {{deceleration}} achieved with manual driving during braking of the Metrocars has been measured at 0.5  m/s 2 by previous work, {{well below the}} full service braking figure of around 1.3  m/s 2 [43]. For ATO, the London Underground Central Line {{can be used as}} a point of comparison. This uses a target deceleration of 0.75  m/s 2 when running above ground and 1.15  m/s 2 in underground sections. The full service maximum here is also around 1.3  m/s 2, and this provides an illustration of the differences in <b>deceleration</b> <b>levels</b> for manual driving and ATO referred to above. However, when the Central line ATO system was first introduced, there were significant issues with low wheel/rail adhesion levels on above-ground sections, with wheel slide under braking resulting in unacceptable levels of wheel flats and station overruns. Low adhesion conditions on the line are most commonly reported during autumn, typically due a combination of light rain and fallen leaves on the rails. When these conditions are present, the ATO target deceleration is reduced to 0.55  m/s 2, in addition to other mitigation measures such as railhead treatment [44].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an {{analytical}} prediction and numerical simulation {{of the behavior}} of square crash box structures having hole at corners on dynamic axial crushing are studied. The focus of the present theoretical prediction is to calculate the mean crushing force and maximum crushing force during the folding process subjected to axial impact loading. Then, the effect of hole size to the crushing response of square crash box structures was also evaluated. For validation, an explicit non-linear commercial finite element code LS-DYNA was used to predict the response of the structures subjected to axial crushing. It was found that results of numerical method and theoretical prediction were in good agreement. The results showed that, by inserting holes at corners, the folding can be controlled to be always started from the hole, and peak crush load on the first fold can be reduced significantly. Meanwhile, the decreasing of mean crushing force is insignificant compared to the one without holes. Hence, the characteristic of impact energy absorption in a progressive buckling can be improved, the damage in passenger compartment can be minimized, and the <b>deceleration</b> <b>level</b> can be kept in safe level to prevent injury of the passenger...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of brake forces between {{front and rear}} axles of a vehicle is typically specified such that {{the same level of}} brake force coefficient is imposed at both front and rear wheels. This condition is known as ‘ideal’ distribution and it is required to deliver the maximum vehicle deceleration and minimum braking distance. For subcritical braking conditions, the deceleration demand may be delivered by different distributions between front and rear brak- ing forces. In this research we show how to obtain the optimal distribution which minimises the pitch angle of a vehicle and hence enhances driver subjective feel during braking. A vehi- cle model including suspension geometry features is adopted. The problem of the minimum pitch brake distribution for a varying <b>deceleration</b> <b>level</b> demand is solved by means of a model predictive control technique. To address the problem of the undesirable pitch rebound caused by a full-stop of the vehicle, a second controller is designed and implemented independently from the braking distribution in use. An extended Kalman filter is designed for state esti- mation and implemented in a high fidelity environment together with the model predictive control strategy. The proposed solution is compared with the reference ‘ideal’ distribution as well as another previous feed-forward solution...|$|R
