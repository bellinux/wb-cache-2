Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and {{are believed to have}} created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.|$|E

Competition was suspended during the war, and upon the restart they rejoined the Hampshire League in the North Division before moving to an enlarged County Division in the 1920–21 season. It was while in this division that they won their most prestigious title to date, the league championship in 1924–25.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is the most}} social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours. Its social {{organisation}} is unlike {{that of any other}} carnivore, bearing closer resemblance to that of cercopithecine primates (baboons and macaques) with respect to group-size, <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structure,</b> and frequency of social interaction among both kin and unrelated group-mates. However, the social system of the spotted hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to kills, mating opportunities and the time of dispersal for males depending on the ability to dominate other clan-members. Females provide only for their own cubs rather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. Spotted hyena society is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.|$|E
40|$|Items in {{real-world}} recommender systems exhibit certain <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures.</b> Similarly, user pref-erences {{also present}} <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures.</b> Re-cent {{studies show that}} incorporating the explicit hi-erarchical structures of items or user preferences can improve the performance of recommender sys-tems. However, explicit <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures</b> are usually unavailable, especially those of user prefer-ences. Thus, there’s {{a gap between the}} importance of <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures</b> and their availability. In this paper, we investigate the problem of explor-ing the implicit <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures</b> for recom-mender systems when they are not explicitly avail-able. We propose a novel recommendation frame-work HSR to bridge the gap, which enables us to capture the implicit <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures</b> of users and items simultaneously. Experimental results on two real world datasets demonstrate the effective-ness of the proposed framework. ...|$|R

However, the inherent structural aspect of such encodings has not received strong attention till lately, when the requirement for mining tasks, like clustering/classification methods, similarity ranking, etc., on <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures</b> has been raised. The key point to perform such tasks is the design of a structural distance metric to quantify the structural similarity between <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures.</b> The chapter will study distance metrics that capture the structural similarity between <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures</b> and approaches that exploit structural distance metrics to perform mining tasks on them...|$|R

5|$|In {{its first}} year, the Referendum Party had little {{established}} organisation and largely remained a concept with limited concrete presence. Goldsmith's finances had allowed its appearance {{to be accompanied}} with mass publicity but it lacked the standard machinery of a political party, such as a mass membership or politically experienced personnel. To counter this problem, Goldsmith sought to create a sophisticated administrative centre and to secure the expertise {{to carry out a}} political campaign, establishing his headquarters in London. By October 1995, the party had established a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structure</b> consisting of three tiers: the centre, region and constituency. Operating the centre was Goldsmith and a cabinet whose membership included Lord McAlpine, who was a former treasurer of the Conservative Party, and two former members of the Conservative Central Office staff. The centre had around 50 staff, who relayed Goldsmith's instructions through to the ten regional co-ordinators, who in turn transmitted them to the prospective candidates in the constituencies. This top-down and undemocratic structure concentrated decision making with Goldsmith and the centre and provided little autonomy for the regions and constituencies, although this was deemed necessary to ensure efficiency in its campaign.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{fabrication}} of <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures</b> by combining bottom-up self-assembly of block copolymer supramolecular assemblies with top-down three-beam interference laser ablation methods. To fabricate the shorter length {{scale in the}} <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures,</b> we use supramolecular assemblies (SMAs) of azobenzene compounds hydrogen bonded with poly(vinyl pyridine) blocks of polystyrene-block-poly(vinyl pyridine) block copolymers. The SMAs form phase separation nanostructures by solvent vapor annealing. The longer length scale of the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures</b> is fabricated by three-beam interference laser ablation on the phase separated nanostructures of the SMAs. The ablation process is induced by single laser shots with 35 ns pulse duration. Tuning of both length scales is feasible by changing the interference conditions and chemical composition of the SMAs, which enables efficient and straightforward fabrication of <b>hierarchical</b> photonic <b>structures...</b>|$|R

To {{the best of our}} knowledge, it is the first report on the controlled synthesis of metal copper <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures.</b> All of the products synthesized in the presence and absence of surfactants, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), were face-centered cubic copper, characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), indicating the surfactant-independent crystal structure. However, supplementing surfactants is helpful to construct <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures</b> and exerts an important influence on copper morphologies. The absence of surfactants {{led to the formation of}} the nubby structures, while the use of surfactants resulted in the synthesis of the flower, dendrite, and sphere-like hierarchical morphologies.

The values of the characteristic parameters such as roughness, skewness, kurtosis, correlation length, and power spectrum density show that the surface morphologies of the cylindrically <b>hierarchical</b> <b>structures</b> not only were affected significantly by Zn 2 + concentration of the growth solution but also were anisotropic due to different curvature radii of the optical fiber core at side and front view...|$|R
