5|$|Every prime, non-split {{alternating}} knot or link complement has {{a subdivision}} rule, with some tiles {{that do not}} subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement. The subdivision rules show what the night sky would look like to someone living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.|$|E

How many pearls are necessary to make <b>a</b> <b>knotted</b> necklace, say <b>a</b> trefoil <b>knot?</b> We show that 15 pearls are sufficient, and that to make <b>a</b> <b>knotted</b> necklace which can {{be put in the}} shallowest-possible show-case (a box with a glass-lid), 16 pearls are necessary and sufficient...|$|R
25|$|A pointe shoe employs two fabric {{ribbons and}} an elastic band to secure {{it to the}} foot. Most {{of the work of}} {{securing}} shoes to feet is done by the ribbons. The two ribbons wrap around the dancer's ankle in opposite directions, overlapping one another so as to form a cross at the front. The ends are then tied together <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>knot,</b> which is then tucked under the ribbon {{on the inside of the}} ankle to hide it from view. The elastic band—which traverses the front of the ankle below the ribbons—keeps the heel of the shoe in place against the foot when the dancer is en pointe.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> chemistry, <b>a</b> {{molecular}} <b>knot,</b> or knotane, is a mechanically-interlocked molecular {{architecture that}} {{is analogous to}} <b>a</b> macroscopic <b>knot.</b> <b>A</b> molecular <b>knot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> trefoil <b>knot</b> configuration is chiral, having at least two enantiomers. Examples of naturally formed knotanes are DNA and certain proteins. Lactoferrin has an unusual biochemical reactivity compared to its linear analogue. Other synthetic molecular <b>knots</b> have <b>a</b> distinct globular shape and nanometer sized dimensions that make them potential building blocks in nanotechnology. The first knot was synthesised by Jean-Pierre Sauvage in 1989.|$|R
