In 1790, Jessop and his partner Outram began to manufacture edge-rails. Jessop became {{a partner in the}} Butterley Company in 1790. The first public edgeway (thus also first public railway) built was Lake Lock Rail Road in 1796. Although {{the primary purpose of the}} line was to carry coal, it also carried passengers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1823, {{there were}} calls for tramways {{to be built}} {{from the head of}} the canal to Swadlincote and Church Gresley. It took the {{committee}} {{two and a half years}} to decide to proceed, and the [...] Swadlincote Railway was opened on 21 July 1827. It was built with double tracks, and used edge rails, similar to modern railways, rather than the [...] "L"-shaped tram plates of the Willesley system. The cost of £4,262 was financed by a mortgage, which was paid off less than a year after opening. The Ticknall branch was extended in 1829, when a line from it to Dimsdale was authorised and built. The Coleorton Railway, which was run by an independent company, and used edge rails, opened in 1833. Negotiations between the two companies resulted in a connecting line being built between Cloud Hill and Worthington Rough, which used a type of rail called a [...] "rib rail", where the vertical flange of Outram's [...] "L"-shaped rail was made much wider, so that wagons with flanged wheels could use it as an <b>edge</b> <b>rail.</b> The Ashby engineer was asked to prepare a quotation for the conversion of the entire Willesley system to rib rails in 1837, but there is no record as to whether this work was carried out.|$|E
5000|$|The company engineer, Edward Barber, {{designed}} a combination tramplate which provided an <b>edge</b> <b>rail,</b> {{and a special}} [...] "combination" [...] wheel that could run on a standard gauge <b>edge</b> <b>rail</b> track or the narrower tramplate track.

The technical progress—and their own line's shortcomings—were noted by Portland and he personally visited the Ardrossan Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway {{to evaluate the}} benefits of <b>edge</b> <b>rails.</b>|$|R

50|$|The first <b>edge</b> <b>rails</b> {{used in a}} wagonway were on the Charnwood Forest Canal, in {{the section}} between Nanpantan and Loughborough.|$|R
5000|$|In 1815 {{the wooden}} track system was altered to use cast iron fish bellied <b>edge</b> <b>rails,</b> {{retaining}} {{a single line}} with passing places. Alexander Scott described it in 1824: ...|$|R
50|$|Cast iron <b>edge</b> <b>rails</b> {{were used}} by Thomas Dadford junior when {{building}} the Beaufort and Blaenavon lines to the Monmouthshire canal in 1793. These were rectangular, 2.5 in in width with a depth of 3 in and 4 ft in length, and required flanges on the wagon wheels. The same year, Benjamin Outram used <b>edge</b> <b>rails</b> on the Cromford Canal. T-shaped beams {{were used by}} William Jessop on the Loughborough-Nanpantan line in 1794, and his sons used I-shaped beams in 1813-15 on a railway from Grantham to Belvoir Castle. Samples of these rails are held in the Science Museum, London.|$|R
5000|$|The {{track gauge}} was [...] The <b>edge</b> <b>rail</b> was in 15 ft {{sections}} of {{malleable cast iron}} at , with five fish-belly webs. The rails were supported on stone blocks, being held in iron chairs. Some of the stone blocks were obtained from the Avon and Gloucestershire company's quarry near Keynsham.|$|E
5000|$|Another form of rail, the <b>edge</b> <b>rail,</b> {{was first}} used by William Jessop on a line which was opened {{as part of the}} Charnwood Forest Canal between Loughborough and Nanpantan in Leicestershire in 1789. This line was {{originally}} designed as a plateway on the Outram system, but objections were raised to rails with upstanding ledges or flanges being laid on the turnpike road. This difficulty was overcome by paving or [...] "causewaying" [...] the road up {{to the level of the}} top of the flanges. In 1790, Jessop and his partner Outram began to manufacture edge-rails. Another example of the <b>edge</b> <b>rail</b> application was the Lake Lock Rail Road used primarily for coal transport. This was a public railway (charging a toll) and opened for traffic in 1798. The route started at Lake Lock, Stanley, on the Aire & Calder Navigation, near Wakefield, and ran to Outwood, a distance of approximately 3 mi. Edge-rails (with a side rack) were also used on the nearby Middleton-Leeds rack railway (a length of this rail is on display in Leeds City Museum).|$|E
5000|$|The {{track gauge}} was [...] this was {{commonly}} employed in South Wales, {{with which the}} engineering of the mines had close contact at that time, and edge rails were used: a considerable technical advance, and the first such use in Cornwall. (The Poldice and other tramways had used plateways, in which the plates are flanged and the wagon wheels are plain; in an <b>edge</b> <b>rail</b> system, the flanges are on {{the wheels of the}} vehicles.) The rails were wrought iron, carried in cast iron chairs supported on granite blocks.|$|E
5000|$|However MacDermot {{states that}} after March 1865 “much {{of the line}} was relaid with ‘compound <b>edge</b> <b>rails</b> or tramplates of a {{peculiar}} character,’ doubtless akin to the Monmouthshire Railway’s combined rail and tramplate.” ...|$|R
25|$|In 1796 {{the system}} 8,230 yards of main line, 2,800 yards of bye way (i.e. sidings and passing loops) and 1,370 yards of check rails. About 1810 the track was {{converted}} {{to the use}} of iron <b>edge</b> <b>rails.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{short-lived}} {{alternative was}} the fish-bellied profile, first used by Thomas Barnes (1765-1801) at Walker Colliery, near Newcastle in 1798, which enabled rails {{to have a}} longer span between blocks. These were T-section <b>edge</b> <b>rails,</b> three feet long and laid on transverse stone sleepers. These were still made of cast iron.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, in the Western Valley, Charles Hodges the {{contractor}} was making rapid {{progress in the}} conversion to <b>edge</b> <b>rail.</b> One line was open on the Ebbw Vale branch and {{the greater part of}} the Blaina branch was complete by September. The following May, the Management Committee were told that the Eastern Valley and Western Valley lines were complete, with the exception of Nine Mile Point, which were to be proceeded with immediately. The line from Risca to Nine Mile Point was completed by November 1855 but not opened to passenger traffic until the Sirhowy Railway did so ten years later.|$|E
5000|$|John Blenkinsop {{thought that}} the {{friction}} would be too low of metal wheels on metal rails, so he built his locomotives for the Middleton Railway in 1812 with a 20 tooth, 3 ft diameter cog wheel (pinion) {{on the left side}} that engaged in rack teeth (two teeth per foot) on the outer side of the rail, the metal [...] "fishbelly" [...] <b>edge</b> <b>rail</b> with its side rack being cast all in one piece, in three feet (one yard) lengths. Blenkinsop's system remained in use for 25 years on the Middleton Railway, but it became a curiosity because simple friction was found to be sufficient for railroads operating on level ground.|$|E
50|$|The M&KR used stone block {{sleepers}} with Birkinshaw's patent {{malleable iron}} rails. At this early date {{the technology of}} rail configuration had not matured, but John Birkinshaw had secured a patent in 1820 for a T-section fish-bellied <b>edge</b> <b>rail</b> of malleable iron. His patent specified {{that they should be}} formed by passing through rollers—as they were fish-bellied, presumably only the head was shaped in the rollers. Cast iron, as used until then, is brittle and ill-suited to heavy railway use; malleable iron is heat treated after casting and is able to withstand shocks. The Stockton and Darlington Railway was the first public railway to adopt Birkinshaw's rail; the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway was either the second or the third public railway.|$|E
50|$|There {{must have}} been some belated dissatisfaction with the plateway as a design, for this branch was built using fish-belly <b>edge</b> <b>rails</b> set in iron chairs spiked to stone blocks, and to a track gauge of , {{preventing}} through running on to the main line. It was horse-operated throughout its working life.|$|R
50|$|Trevithick was {{disappointed}} by the response and designed no more railway locomotives. It was not until 1812 that twin-cylinder steam locomotives, built by Matthew Murray in Holbeck, successfully started replacing horses for hauling coal wagons on the <b>edge</b> <b>railed,</b> rack and pinion Middleton Railway from Middleton colliery to Leeds, West Yorkshire.|$|R
50|$|Technical {{progress}} in railways had developed <b>edge</b> <b>rails,</b> which {{were capable of}} carrying heavier wheel loads, {{and it is likely}} that an edge railway had been built alongside {{the lower part of the}} Carmarthenshire alignment before 1832, by which time the now-outmoded Carmarthenshire Tramroad had fallen into disuse north of Felin Foel.|$|R
50|$|The first railway on the island, {{dating from}} 1806, was a horse-worked plateway from Cros-ny-Cuirn to Balladwail, a port {{south-east}} of Crovan's Gate, {{which is no}} longer rail-connected. Pack horses brought copper ore from a mine in the mountains down to Cros-ny-Cuirn, where it was loaded into wagons for the journey to the port. In 1820 the Crovan's Gate Mining Company extended the line up the valley to the mine by building a series of five inclined planes. At the same time, {{the rest of the}} 1806 line was rebuilt with fish-belly <b>edge</b> <b>rail.</b> The line continued in use until the Skarloey Railway was built, after which it was abandoned, although the overgrown remains can still be seen to this day.|$|E
50|$|The Eastern and Western Valley {{sections}} were not connected at Newport, due to objections from the Town Council to street running. An application {{was made in}} 1852 within a Parliamentary Bill to stop up the canal from the Mill Pond to Potter Street lock near the dock, and to seek more capital. A total of £200,000 was required to complete the conversion in the Western Valley, to provide a depot for carriages, locomotives and other stock, together with all the necessary buildings, workshops and essential machinery. The Bill was approved, allowing the money to be raised by the issuing of £150,000 of new share stock. The railway link between Mill St and Dock Street stations was authorised; the section of canal {{there was to be}} closed, and any carrier had the right to demand free carriage from the new canal terminus to the dock by the Company in compensation for the loss of the canal section. All the existing tramroads had to be converted to <b>edge</b> <b>rail</b> and the independent users would be allowed three months by the Company to alter their stock.|$|E
5000|$|In 1823, {{there were}} calls for tramways {{to be built}} {{from the head of}} the canal to Swadlincote and Church Gresley. It took the {{committee}} {{two and a half years}} to decide to proceed, and the 3 mi Swadlincote Railway was opened on 21 July 1827. It was built with double tracks, and used edge rails, similar to modern railways, rather than the [...] "L"-shaped tram plates of the Willesley system. The cost of £4,262 was financed by a mortgage, which was paid off less than a year after opening. The Ticknall branch was extended in 1829, when a line from it to Dimsdale was authorised and built.

50|$|Plateways were {{particularly}} favoured in South Wales and the Forest of Dean, {{in some cases}} replacing existing <b>edge</b> <b>rails.</b> Other notable plateways included the Hay Railway, the Gloucester and Cheltenham Railway, the Surrey Iron Railway, the Derby Canal Railway, the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway, the Portreath Tramroad in Cornwall and lines at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire.|$|R
5000|$|Salamanca was {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} steam locomotive, built in 1812 by Matthew Murray of Holbeck, for the <b>edge</b> <b>railed</b> Middleton Railway between Middleton and Leeds. It {{was the first}} to have two cylinders. It was named after the Duke of Wellington's victory at the battle of Salamanca which was fought that same year.|$|R
50|$|However, in 1812, Matthew Murray and John Blenkinsop had {{produced}} the first twin cylinder steam locomotive, Salamanca, for Middleton Colliery railway near Leeds, using a pinion engaging with teeth along the iron <b>edge</b> <b>rails</b> track (first rack railway). This {{had been the}} first steam locomotive railway to work successfully, but the system was complex and expensive.|$|R
50|$|Because a stiff wheel {{rolling on}} a rigid rail {{requires}} far less energy per ton-mile moved than road transport (with a highly compliant wheel on an uneven surface), railroads are highly {{suitable for the}} movement of dense, bulk goods such as coal and other minerals. This was an incentive to experiment with many configurations and shapes of wheels and rails. In the late 1760s, the Coalbrookdale Company began to fix plates of cast iron to the upper surface of the wooden rails. These (and earlier railways) had flanged wheels as on modern railways, but another system was introduced, in which unflanged wheels ran on L-shaped metal plates - these became known as plateways. John Curr, a Sheffield colliery manager, invented this flanged rail, though the exact date of this is disputed. The plate rail was taken up by Benjamin Outram for wagonways serving his canals, manufacturing them at his Butterley ironworks. Meanwhile, William Jessop, a civil engineer, had used a form of <b>edge</b> <b>rail</b> successfully for an extension to the Charnwood Forest Canal at Nanpantan, Loughborough, Leicestershire in 1789. Jessop became {{a partner in the}} Butterley Company in 1790. The flanged wheel eventually proved its superiority due to its performance on curves, and the composite iron/wood rail was replaced by an all-metal rail, with its vastly superior stiffness, durability, and safety.|$|E
40|$|Although in {{one sense}} this {{is a study in}} {{regional}} or local history, its findings have much wider implications which are of national significance. Britain gave to the world the Industrial Revolution and, as a corollary, the railway. Evidence which throws new light on the evolution of railways is therefore of high importance to historians and archaeologists of industry. Such evidence, it is suggested, is presented in this thesis. It relates mainly to the evolution of that most essential component of any railway, its track, and to the industrial archaeology of what was the leading iron-producing region of its day. From the 1790 s into the 1840 s South Wales and, in particular, the Heads of the Valleys was much the largest producer of iron in Britain. To feed the works with raw materials there was a major system of railroads and tramroads which, except perhaps for the North-eastern coalfield, was by far the most extensive in Britain and therefore in the world. Even the tramroads of Shropshire, though tight-packed, were much smaller in extent. As it turned out, the North-east had the greatest influence on the Railway Age, with South Wales not remaining in the vanguard of progress for long. However, it was in South Wales that the first all-iron <b>edge</b> <b>rail</b> was used, and South Wales developed the tramroad to its highest form. Here too, among the precursors of the Railway Age, elements of the public railway were forged. There are three components to the South Wales network. First, the feeders which ran from the limestone quarries of the northem outcrop to the furnaces can be followed for about 100 km in total. Although a fair proportion of this distance is now buried by tarmacced roads, within the quarries themselves lie around 20 km of traceable routes. Second, a quite different set of lines led to the furnaces from the coal and iron ore mines, which lay closer than the quarries to the ironworks; but if underground track were included their mileage would be huge. Third, the exit lines from the ironworks to the ports, canals and nearby markets (as far away as Kington and Hereford) add a further 190 km. Another guide to the enormous mileage built comes from the 10, 500 tons of rails cast at Ebbw Vale between 1808 and 1816. If these were 3 ft plates of a fairly standard 45 lb apiece, they would total nearly half a million, or enough to complete about 220 km of tramroad. This from only one ironworks over a mere nine years. So rich an area can only be studied in detail bit by bit. This thesis is therefore restricted to the limestone feeders of the northern outcrop, which archaeologically are the most fruitful. Most of the exit lines have been obscured by later railways; the coal and iron ore feeders are either underground and inaccessible or, where on the surface, have often been tipped over by later workings or destroyed by land reclamation. The limestone quarry feeders therefore provide the best opportunity to record early railways in South Wales. Many of the quarries which supplied the works remain as they were abandoned nearly a century ago. These vast monuments cover an area in excess of 4. 5 square kilometres. The importance of the archaeology of the quarrying industry has been established by English Heritage with the publication of a Step I report as part of the Monuments Protection Programme. But the future of the South Wales quarries is not assured. Many could be re-developed through the Interim Development Orders granted in 1947, {{at a time when they}} were regarded as eyesores with no particular relevance to our past. Owners of largely unproductive areas of moorland are constantly looking for ways of increasing income. Quarrying for roadstone offers a lucrative return, and provides some jobs in largely rural communities which, theoretically, stimulate local economies. In the relevant counties output, mostly for roadstone, grew from 1, 343, 000 tons in 1895 to 15, 515, 000 in 1974. 3 It is this threat which in part prompted this study. Although a great deal of attention has been devoted to the history of railways in South Wales (as in the rest of Britain) after 1830, relatively little has been given to their evolution. While previous studies have established the outline - notably Macdermot, Marshall, Lee, Barrie, Clinker, Baxter, Rattenbury and Hughes - these were mainly related to identifying the subject or concentrated on existing lines and documentary sources. Limestone railways have been largely ignored (with the partial exception of Rattenbury and Hughes), and little industrial archaeological survey has hitherto been done. My work, then, breaks new ground. It is intended as a contribution not to business or economic history, but rather to industrial archaeology and the history of technology. As such it combines extensive fieldwork with a detailed study of the history of limestone feeders from documentary sources, some printed but mostly in the National Library of Wales, Gwent Record Office and similar repositories. The result throws a completely new light on the artefacts of early railways, and especially on their permanent way. This has allowed for the first time a provisional typology to be made, and improved our understanding of the influences at work...|$|E
50|$|The new engines {{were too}} heavy to run on wooden rails or plate-way, and iron <b>edge</b> <b>rails</b> were in their infancy, with cast iron exhibiting {{excessive}} brittleness. Together with William Losh, Stephenson improved the design of cast iron <b>edge</b> <b>rails</b> to reduce breakage; rails were briefly made by Losh, Wilson and Bell at their Walker ironworks. According to Rolt, Stephenson managed {{to solve the problem}} caused by the weight of the engine on the primitive rails. He experimented with a steam spring (to 'cushion' the weight using steam pressure acting on pistons to support the locomotive frame), but soon followed the practice of 'distributing' weight by utilising a number of wheels or bogies. For the Stockton and Darlington Railway Stephenson used wrought iron malleable rails that he had found satisfactory, not withstanding the financial loss he suffered by not using his own patented design.|$|R
25|$|In 1790 Jessop founded, {{jointly with}} {{partners}} Benjamin Outram, Francis Beresford and John Wright, the Butterley Iron Works in Derbyshire to manufacture (amongst other things) cast-iron <b>edge</b> <b>rails</b> – a design Jessop had used successfully on a horse-drawn railway scheme for coal wagons between Nanpantan and Loughborough, Leicestershire (1789). Outram {{was concerned with}} the production of ironwork and equipment for Jessop's engineering projects.|$|R
5000|$|William Jessop {{had used}} <b>edge</b> <b>rails</b> cast in three foot lengths, with [...] "fish-bellying" [...] to give greater {{strength}} {{along the length}} of the rail on a line between Nanpantan and Loughborough, Leicestershire in 1789. However, after he became a partner in Benjamin Outram and Company (Butterley Iron Works) he designed the Surrey Iron Railway and the Kilmarnock and Troon Railways as plateways.|$|R
50|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>rails</b> {{required}} a close match between rail spacing and {{the configuration of}} the wheelsets, and the importance of the gauge was reinforced. Railways were still seen as local concerns: there was no appreciation of a future connection to other lines, and selection of the track gauge was still a pragmatic decision based on local requirements and prejudices, and probably determined by existing local designs of (road) vehicles.|$|R
