However <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> {{that this is}} an inference from name alone, and does not constitute historical evidence of any fighting force raised by a Cornish hundred.|$|E
25|$|Gode argues, additionally, {{that the}} western {{languages}} are the unofficial languages of international science, medicine, and technology, and therefore an IAL based on them provides the best access to that literature. Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that a more neutral vocabulary, perhaps even an a priori one, would be less offensive to some non-Europeans.|$|E
25|$|Piérola {{has been}} criticised {{because of his}} sectarianism, {{frivolous}} investment, bombastic decrees, lack of control in budget, but <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that he put forth an enormous effort to obtain new funds and to mobilize {{the country for the}} war. Basadre considers his work an act of heroism, abnegation in a country invaded, politically divided, militarily battered and economically bloodless.|$|E

25|$|Kenya's {{failure in}} the above tournament is perhaps {{indicative}} of how they failed to capitalise on their World Cup success, though <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> {{that not all of}} that failure was on the field. Although Kenya were given plenty of matches against national A sides, and played in the Carib Beer Cup in the West Indies in 2004, Kenya only played two ODIs in the three years after the Sharjah tournament, against India and Pakistan in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy.|$|E
25|$|Violence in Portuguese schools {{became an}} {{educational}} {{issue for the}} first time during the 1990s, mainly through the persistence of parental associations and teacher claims. However, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that {{this was not the first}} time that violence appeared in Portuguese schools as a significant situation. After the 25 de Abril revolution of 1974 the occurrence of violent situations reached the highest point. This was a politically socialized and framed violence, quite different from the kind of violence we can find today. That one had political programs, this one is quite anomic. Its origin is very diverse, from poverty to psychological problems. Theft, random or systematic physical aggression, bullying, destruction of school or teachers properties are realities which become current in many schools.|$|E
25|$|All of {{this would}} go to waste however, when Henry VI died of a fever in Messina on 28 September 1197. Following his death many of the higher ranking nobles {{abandoned}} the crusade to protect their interests in the Holy Roman Empire. When civil war broke out shortly after, the crusade found itself leaderless and in 1198 the crusaders retreated back to Tyre and sailed for home. The result was that the crusade had the detrimental effect of destroying Byzantium's dignity and wealth whilst failing to assist her against the Turks. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> however that the Byzantines after 1180 entertained no serious plans to reclaim Anatolia from the Turks, so how much territory Henry VI or his predecessor Frederick I seized may have been of little consequence in the long run.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that Kremmerz’s work of {{promulgation}} came {{up against}} a number of obstacles, some of which came from the esoteric world itself, from areas still bound by a conservative and elitist vision of ancient wisdom and its transmission.|$|R
25|$|While the Persians {{were making}} headway in their {{conquest of the}} eastern provinces, Phocas chose to divide his {{subjects}} rather than unite them against {{the threat of the}} Persians. Perhaps seeing his defeats as divine retribution, Phocas initiated a savage and bloody campaign to forcibly convert the Jews to Christianity. Persecutions and alienation of the Jews, a frontline people in the war against the Persians helped drove them into aiding the Persian conquerors. As Jews and Christians began tearing each other apart, some fled the butchery into Persian territory. Meanwhile, it appears that the disasters befalling the Empire led the Emperor into a state of paranoia — although <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that there were numerous plots against his rule and execution followed execution. Among those individuals who were executed was the former empress Constantina and her three daughters.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study of}} the Amerindian ancestry of Argentines was headed by Argentine {{geneticist}} Daniel Corach of the University of Buenos Aires. The {{results of this study}} in which DNA from 320 individuals in 9 Argentine provinces was examined showed that 56% of these individuals had at least one Amerindian ancestor. Another study on African ancestry was also conducted by the University of Buenos Aires in the city of La Plata. In this study 4.3% of the 500 study participants were shown to have some degree of African ancestry. Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> here that this type of genetic studies -meant only to search for specific lineages in the mtDNA or in the Y-Chromosome, which do not recombine- may be misleading. For example, a person with seven European great-grandparents and only one Amerindian/Mestizo great-grandparent will be included in that 56%, although his/her phenotype will most probably be Caucasian.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote that}} {{watching}} it left him [...] "reeling with turmoil and confusion, {{with feelings of}} sadness and despair," [...] and called it a [...] "thoroughly painful and depressing experience - but, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said,</b> {{one that has been}} powerfully written, directed and acted." [...] He awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that this [...] "slick, riveting, viscerally scary film about what in other hands would be a decidedly unsalable subject, namely death," [...] is [...] "both quaint and devastating." [...] However, Desson Thomson of The Washington Post felt disappointed with the film that is [...] "ultimately flat on its surrealistic face, the victim of too many fake-art sequences." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Jacob's Ladder is so 'dark' it sucks Robbins right down with it. By the time Jacob is being strapped to a bed and wheeled down a hospital corridor strewn with bloody limbs, it's hard to care whether the Orwellian image is a hallucination or not. You just want out." [...] Kim Newman called the film [...] "effectively the blunt remake" [...] of Carnival of Souls.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the album's legacy {{as one of the}} most influential recordings of all time, Modern Sounds also had an effect on Charles's later work. According to writer Nate Guidry, the recording marked the zenith of Charles's popularity and success. By the mid-1960s and continuing into the 1970s and 1980s, the majority of his musical output was focused onto more middle of the road and pop releases, featuring less of his recognizable, trademark soul and R, and more of the crossover and fusion tendencies of Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music. On the album's influence, columnist Spencer Leigh of The Independent stated that [...] "Numerous artists followed Charles's lead, but <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that Charles himself repeated the trick much too often." [...] The period of releases following Modern Sounds, which includes the musician's later recording years as well, has been recognized by music writers and critics as a [...] "critical slide" [...] and the weakest in his recording career. Several of the LP albums from this period have yet to be reissued and have remained rare among record collectors, if not out of print. Charles's final studio album Genius Loves Company (2004) would later be released shortly after his death, and proved to be a comeback success, in terms of sales and critical response, as it quickly became Charles's first top-10 album in forty years and the best-selling record of his career.|$|E

2500|$|Christopher Shea {{wrote for}} The Washington Post that [...] "In the end, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said,</b> {{the profusion of}} {{proposals}} in Nudge, however worthy, and the countless summaries of studies supporting them grow a bit wearisome.

2500|$|Complexes {{that have}} {{unfilled}} or half-filled orbitals often show {{the capability to}} react with substrates. [...] Most substrates have a singlet ground-state; that is, they have lone electron pairs (e.g., water, amines, ethers), so these substrates need an empty orbital {{to be able to}} react with a metal centre. [...] Some substrates (e.g., molecular oxygen) have a triplet ground state, which results that metals with half-filled orbitals have a tendency to react with such substrates (<b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that the dioxygen molecule also has lone pairs, so it is also capable to react as a 'normal' Lewis base).|$|E
2500|$|... {{although}} one doesn't {{want to be}} too hard on Haig ... who has been well calumniated already ... <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that it now appears was that one thing the war was testing was {{the usefulness of the}} earnest Scottish character in a situation demanding the military equivalent of wit and invention. Haig had none. He was stubborn, self-righteous, inflexible, intolerant—especially of the French—and quite humourless ... Indeed, one powerful legacy of Haig's performance is the conviction among the imaginative and intelligent today of the unredeemable defectiveness of all civil and military leaders. [...] Haig could be said to have established the paradigm.|$|E
