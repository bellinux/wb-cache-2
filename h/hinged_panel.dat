25|$|Bösendorfer {{pioneered the}} {{extension}} of the typical 88-key keyboard, creating the Imperial Grand (Model 290), which has 97 keys (eight octaves). Ferruccio Busoni initially ordered this innovation in 1909 as part of a custom piano as he wanted to transcribe an organ piece that extended to the C below the standard keyboard. This innovation worked so well that this piano was added to regular product offerings and quickly became one of the world's most sought-after concert grands. Because of the 290's success, the extra strings were added to Bösendorfer's other line of instruments such as the 225 model, which has 92 keys. The extra keys, at the bass end of the keyboard, were originally hidden beneath a <b>hinged</b> <b>panel</b> mounted between the piano's conventional low A and the left-hand end-cheek to prevent their being struck accidentally during normal play; more recent models have omitted this device and simply have the upper surface of the extra natural keys finished in matte black instead of white to differentiate them from the standard 88.|$|E
2500|$|While earlier [...] "short-body" [...] Hueys were a success, the Army {{wanted a}} version that could carry more troops. [...] Bell's {{solution}} was to stretch the HU-1B fuselage by [...] and use the extra space to fit four seats next to the transmission, facing out. Seating capacity increased to 15, including crew. [...] The enlarged cabin could also accommodate six stretchers and a medic, two more than the earlier models. [...] In place of the earlier model's sliding side doors with a single window, larger doors were fitted which had two windows, plus a small <b>hinged</b> <b>panel</b> with an optional window, providing enhanced access to the cabin. The doors and hinged panels were quickly removable, allowing the Huey to be flown in a [...] "doors off" [...] configuration.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Gwendolen!" [...] {{said the}} small Isabel, {{in a tone}} of astonishment, while she held open a <b>hinged</b> <b>panel</b> of the {{wainscot}} {{at the other end of}} the room.|$|E

50|$|Later, other {{variants}} {{that built}} upon the basic design, appeared - {{such as the}} Elliot trap used in Europe and Australasia. The Elliot trap has simplified the design slightly and is made from just 7 <b>hinged</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
25|$|The organ {{was built}} in 1973 by the Liverpool firm of organ builders, Rushworth and Dreaper, {{replacing}} an earlier organ made by the same firm. It is a locally unusual example of an organ with baroque voicing, and, {{in place of the}} usual swell louvres, it features opening doors with carved <b>hinged</b> <b>panels.</b> This organ was rebuilt by Peter Collins in 2008.|$|R

5000|$|Lépine is also {{credited}} {{for introducing}} hand-setting {{at the back}} of the watch and the hunter case (or savonette) that completely covers a dial with its spring-loaded <b>hinged</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Polyptychs {{typically}} display one [...] "central" [...] or [...] "main" [...] {{panel that}} is usually {{the largest of the}} attachments, while the other panels are called [...] "side" [...] panels, or [...] "wings". Sometimes, as evident in the Ghent and Isenheim works, the <b>hinged</b> <b>panels</b> can be varied in arrangement to show different [...] "views" [...] or [...] "openings" [...] in the piece.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary design {{proposed}} for large, lightweight telescope shroud or light shield carried to orbit in single Space Shuttle cargo load. Shroud concept applied on Earth in portable, compactly storable displays or projection screens. Large telescope shroud includes four deployable masts erecting eight walls of <b>hinged</b> <b>panels</b> of polyimide film. Panels stored fanfolded before deployment and threaded on guide wires unwinding from spools and remain taut during deployment...|$|R
5000|$|Another barrier {{design has}} been {{produced}} from Form Designs Australia, {{who were also}} involved {{in the trial of}} the Eco Shark Barrier. The [...] "Bionic Barrier" [...] was designed to overcome {{some of the issues that}} arose in the trial, including increasing flexibility with <b>hinge</b> <b>panels</b> to adapt to tides and swell. [...] The structural performance of this design could not be assessed although it potentially improves the current system.|$|R
50|$|A Liseuse desk is a {{medium-sized}} writing {{table with a}} small <b>hinged</b> <b>panel</b> in the middle which can spring up by {{the aid of a}} mechanism or be propped up at a desired angle to facilitate reading, or writing on its slanted surface. Many have lateral panels which swing out on both sides to give a larger desk surface.|$|E
5000|$|As {{in every}} Bristol saloon since the 404, a {{compartment}} accessed via a <b>hinged</b> <b>panel</b> between {{the front of}} the driver's door and the rear of the front wheel arch housed the battery, fuse panel, windscreen wiper motor and brake servos. [...] A similar panel {{on the other side of}} the car housed the spare wheel and jack.|$|E
50|$|Bumpers and Magna wheels were {{standardised}} on all Austin's de luxe {{models in}} September 1932 {{and in addition}} there were all round price reductions. In August 1933 a new Ascot saloon was announced with chassis improvements and the same changes as made to the Twelve-Four range. The new Ascot had a new separate compartment for the spare tyre and its <b>hinged</b> <b>panel</b> forms a luggage platform when lowered.|$|E
5000|$|Panels {{of varying}} {{sizes and shapes}} with {{flexible}} <b>panels</b> or <b>hinges</b> between <b>panels</b> such as Tog'l, Jovo Click 'N Construct, Zaks, and Polydron.|$|R
5000|$|The font is {{octagonal}} {{and carved}} with initials and date [...] "EM 1662". The octagonal wooden font {{cover with a}} central finial has <b>hinged</b> <b>panels</b> on four sides. Doorways to the parvis stairs and rood loft stairs are in the south wall of the south aisle and the south wall of the north aisle respectively. The three chancel windows contain stained glass by Patrick Reyntiens installed in 1962. The church contains memorials to Edward Cole (d. 1757) and George Maplesden (d. 1688).|$|R
50|$|Tents {{are usually}} owned by families, {{although}} a few tents, such as the preacher's, are owned by the camp committee. A boarding tent with six sleeping rooms offers food, and a confectionery is located outside the circle. At {{the center of the}} circle is the tabernacle. Originally a long shed, two arms were added to make it cruciform in shape, with three arms used for seating while a fourth serves as a chancel. <b>Hinged</b> <b>panels</b> open to allow a view into the tabernacle from outside. Benches outside accommodate overflow.|$|R
5000|$|This single drawer, however, is a dummy. It is a <b>hinged</b> <b>panel</b> {{which is}} meant to be folded in, {{at the same time as}} half of the hinged top surface is folded back on to the top of the other half, {{revealing}} an inner desktop surface of normal height, with small drawers and pigeonholes in the back. In certain spinet desks the inner desktop surface can be drawn out a few inches, adding working space.|$|E
50|$|The VL2B saw {{the light}} source {{upgraded}} to a HTI-400SE, short arc discharge lamp, driven by the upgraded APS400 PSU. A very pale blue dichroic filter was replaced with 3200°K tungsten correction and the beam iris motor replaced with one of a higher resolution. VL2B luminaires can be distinguished {{by the absence of}} ventilation louvres on the rear panel of the head; which were replaced by a <b>hinged</b> <b>panel,</b> through which to access the new lamp base for bulb changes and line-up.|$|E
50|$|Equipment for {{the lunar}} {{exploration}} was {{carried in the}} Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA), a drawer mounted on a <b>hinged</b> <b>panel</b> {{dropping out of the}} lefthand forward compartment. Besides the astronaut's surface excavation tools and sample collection boxes, the MESA contained a television camera with a tripod; as the commander opened the MESA by pulling on a lanyard while descending the ladder, the camera was automatically activated to send the first pictures of the astronauts on the surface back to Earth. A United States flag for the astronauts to erect on the surface was carried in a container mounted on the ladder of each landing mission.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the upper floor of the building is arranged with a central hall running parallel to Quay Street which houses the stair and provides access to the rooms. The lower floor, has been subject to major alterations which have modified the floor plan. Most significantly walls have been removed and, in some places realigned, to form a large reception area, to which access in gained via the entrance doorway from the ground floor verandah. This doorway is fitted with four glazed <b>hinged</b> <b>panels</b> which are centre opening.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house is}} a -story frame house on a full, raised basement. The house was covered in clapboards. The {{house is a}} [...] "Charleston-type" [...] house built to take {{advantage}} of summer breezes. It has two-story porch or veranda that wraps around three sides of the house. There are two sets of stairs leading from ground level to the first floor. These lead through French doors to either the parlor or the drawing room. Some of the second floor windows have <b>hinged</b> <b>panels</b> below to allow access to the veranda.|$|R
5000|$|The new Huey was {{designated}} UH-1D by the US Army {{and as the}} Model 205 by Bell. The enlarged cabin could also accommodate six stretchers, double that of the earlier models, making the [...] "Delta" [...] a good MEDEVAC aircraft. In place of the earlier model's sliding side doors with a single window, larger doors were fitted which had two windows, plus a small [...] "hinged panel" [...] with an optional window, providing access to the cabin. The doors and <b>hinged</b> <b>panels</b> were quickly removable and the Huey could be flown in that configuration.|$|R
50|$|Its {{fuselage}} {{was built}} around four spruce longerons and was rectangular in section. The extreme nose was a duralumin dome, the central region was ply covered and fabric covered the tapering rear section. Its three seats were in tandem, with the pilot in front over the wing leading edge, a passenger behind over {{the centre of}} gravity and a third seat, which could be fitted with dual control, in the rear. A windowed cabin top was envisaged but {{does not appear in}} the few published photographs of the Duverne-Saran, so {{it may not have been}} fitted. The fuselage design made it easy to modify; for example, a <b>hinged</b> <b>panel</b> in the side could admit patients on a stretcher.|$|E
5000|$|Riddell Revolution helmets are {{a line of}} {{football}} helmets. The helmet brand {{is the most popular}} model in use in the National Football League, used by 83% of the players in the league as of 2008. [...] The most recent model in the Revolution line is the Speedflex helmet. This model can come equipped with Riddell's HITS Technology, which consists of a sensor in the helmet that relays data regarding the severity of each hit to a computer system. The Speedflex also features a built-in <b>hinged</b> <b>panel</b> located on the front near the top. In head-on collisions, this panel gives by up to a quarter of an inch (6 mm), helping to absorb the impact.|$|E
50|$|The Godfrey Ludwig House {{stands on}} the west side of SR 32 in {{northern}} Waldoboro, roughly midway between the town center and that of neighboring Jefferson. The house is a 1-1/2 story brick Cape style house, with a side gable roof, end chimneys, and a granite foundation. The brick walls are painted white. Its street-facing front facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by recessed sidelight windows. A wood frame ell with cross-gable roof extends from the rear of the main block. The interior of the house follows a center hall plan. The halls side walls are fitted with special <b>hinged</b> <b>panel</b> sections, making it possible to create a single large chamber out of the hall and the flanking parlors.|$|E
5000|$|As in a [...] "secretaire a abattant" [...] or in a Fall {{front desk}} the main working surface or desktop is hinged and lifted {{completely}} from the horizontal to the vertical {{in order to}} lock up the desk, forcing the user to gather up and store all papers and implements beforehand. Unlike the secretaire a abattant however, the Wooton desktop hides {{only a few of}} the small drawers and nooks. The real lockup is done by closing two massive <b>hinged</b> <b>panels</b> which are themselves as deep as the desk and are like it filled with small drawers and nooks of all sizes.|$|R
50|$|The {{cargo bed}} can vary in size {{according}} to whether the vehicle is optimized for cargo utility or passenger comfort. Most have fixed side walls and a hinged tailgate. Cargo beds are normally found in two styles: step-side or fleet-side. A step-side bed has fenders which extend {{on the outside of}} the cargo area. A fleet-side bed has wheel-wells inside the bed. The first fleet-sided truck was the 1955 Chevrolet Cameo Carrier. Early trucks had wood plank beds, which were replaced by steel by the 1960s. Some European-style trucks use a drop-side bed with a flat tray with <b>hinged</b> <b>panels</b> rising up on the sides and the rear.|$|R
5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} folding patterns that have flat-folded states, {{it does not}} describe the folding process needed to reach that state. For some folding patterns, {{it may be necessary}} to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For rigid origami (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for <b>hinged</b> <b>panels</b> of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|R
5000|$|While earlier [...] "short-body" [...] Hueys were a success, the Army {{wanted a}} version that could carry more troops. Bell's {{solution}} was to stretch the HU-1B fuselage by 41 in and use the extra space to fit four seats next to the transmission, facing out. Seating capacity increased to 15, including crew.

The doors and hinged panels were quickly removable, allowing the Huey to be flown in a [...] "doors off" [...] configuration.|$|E
5000|$|The extreme wedge {{body shape}} was {{possible}} {{due to the}} engine's flat horizontally opposed cylinder layout shared by all Subarus in 1985. Extensive wind tunnel testing was used to lower wind resistance and even [...] "aircraft type" [...] door handles were used that were totally flush with {{the outside of the}} door. To open the door, it was required to push a <b>hinged</b> <b>panel</b> out of the release mechanism's opening. There is one 22 inch windshield wiper, when not in use tucks under the hood, and rubber spoilers before each wheel well opening doubled as [...] "mud guards" [...] but really acted to direct airflow smoothly past the tires and wheels. The result {{was one of the most}} aerodynamic production cars of its time with a coefficient of drag or Cd. of 0.29, improved fuel economy, and a quieter ride due to reduced amounts of wind noise.|$|E

5000|$|The Wilton Diptych (...) {{is a small}} {{portable}} diptych of two <b>hinged</b> <b>panels,</b> {{painted on}} both sides, now in the National Gallery, London. It is an extremely rare survival of a late Medieval religious panel painting from England. The diptych was painted for King Richard II of England who is depicted kneeling before the Virgin and Child in {{what is known as}} a donor portrait. He is presented to them by his patron saint, John the Baptist, and by the English royal saints Edward the Confessor and Edmund the Martyr. The painting is an outstanding example of the International Gothic style, and the nationality of the unknown artist is probably French or English.|$|R
5000|$|Bragg {{was devoted}} to the ideal of public education, {{and one of her}} most {{successful}} initiatives in Charleston was what became known as [...] "Bragg Boxes" [...] or [...] "Bragg's Boxes." [...] Founded on the idea of bringing the museum to people who, for whatever reason, couldn't come to the museum, the Bragg Boxes were circulating exhibits that were sent out to students in both urban and rural areas beginning in around 1913. Wooden boxes with <b>hinged</b> <b>panels,</b> they opened into [...] "miniature stage sets" [...] or dioramas on either local natural history (green-painted boxes) or cultural history (red-painted boxes). They were accompanied by teaching materials—often developed by Bragg herself—and objects that could be handled by the students. She created over five dozen of these boxes altogether.|$|R
