5|$|Research {{and studies}} were {{initiated}} {{to find a}} safe method to destroy the materials and it was discovered they could be incinerated safely under special conditions of temperature and <b>dwell</b> <b>time.</b> However, these herbicides were expensive and the Air Force wanted to resell its surplus instead of dumping it at sea. Among many methods tested, a possibility of salvaging the herbicides by reprocessing and filtering out the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) contaminant with carbonized (charcoaled) coconut fibers. This concept was then tested in 1976 and a pilot plant constructed at Gulfport.|$|E
5|$|Since June 2009, {{when two}} Red Line trains {{collided}} and killed nine people {{due in part}} to malfunctions in the ATC system, all Metro trains have been manually operated. The current state of manual operation has led to heavily degraded service, with new manual requirements such as absolute blocks, speed restrictions, and end-of-platform stopping leading to increased headways between trains, increased <b>dwell</b> <b>time,</b> and worse on-time performance. Metro originally planned to have all trains be automated again by 2017, but those plans were shelved in early 2017 in order to focus on more pressing safety and infrastructure issues.|$|E
5|$|Organofluorines exhibit biopersistence {{due to the}} {{strength}} of the carbon–fluorine bond. Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), which are sparingly water-soluble owing to their acidic functional groups, are noted persistent organic pollutants; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are most often researched. PFAAs have been found in trace quantities worldwide from polar bears to humans, with PFOS and PFOA known to reside in breast milk and the blood of newborn babies. A 2013 review showed a slight correlation between groundwater and soil PFAA levels and human activity; there was no clear pattern of one chemical dominating, and higher amounts of PFOS were correlated to higher amounts of PFOA. In the body, PFAAs bind to proteins such as serum albumin; they tend to concentrate within humans in the liver and blood before excretion through the kidneys. <b>Dwell</b> <b>time</b> in the body varies greatly by species, with half-lives of days in rodents, and years in humans. High doses of PFOS and PFOA cause cancer and death in newborn rodents but human studies have not established an effect at current exposure levels.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the factors that determine the <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> in a visual search task, that is, the duration the gaze remains fixated on an object. It {{has been suggested that}} an item’s similarity to the search target should be an important determiner of <b>dwell</b> <b>times,</b> because <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> are taken to reflect the time needed to reject the item as a distractor, and such discriminations are supposed to be harder the more similar an item is to the search target. In line with this similarity view, a previous study shows that, in search for a target ring of thin line-width, <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin linewidth Landolt C’s distractors were longer than <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on Landolt C’s with thick or medium linewidth. However, <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> may have been longer on thin Landolt C’s because the thin line-width made it harder to detect whether the stimuli had a gap or not. Thus, it is an open question whether <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin line-width distractors were longer because they were similar to the target or because the perceptual decision was more difficult. The present study de-coupled similarity from perceptual difficulty, by measuring <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin, medium and thick line-width distractors when the target had thin, medium or thick line-width. The results showed that <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> were longer on target-similar than target-dissimilar stimuli across all target conditions and regardless of the line-width. It is concluded that prior findings of longer <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin linewidthdistractors can clearly be attributed to target similarity. As will be discussed towards the end, the finding of similarity effect...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} the tables, <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> in some cases can reach also values above 90  sec. The reason {{lies in the fact}} that these values {{represent}} the converging <b>dwell</b> <b>times,</b> i.e. the <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> reached at the end of the evolution of the snowball effect, which, as mentioned before, magnifies the involved quantities.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Dose plans {{generated}} with optimization models hitherto used in HDR brachytherapy {{have shown}} a tendency to yield longer <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> than manually optimized plans. Concern has been raised for the corresponding undesired hot spots and various methods to mitigate these have been developed. The hypotheses of this work are a) that one cause for the long <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> {{is the use of}} objective functions comprising simple linear penalties and b) that alternative penalties, being piecewise linear, would lead to reduced length of individual <b>dwell</b> <b>times.</b> Methods: The characteristics of the linear penalties and the piecewise linear penalties are analysed mathematically. Experimental comparisons between the two types of penalties are carried out retrospectively for a set of prostate cancer patients. Results: While most dose-volume parameters do not differ significantly between the two types of penalties significant changes {{can be seen in the}} <b>dwell</b> <b>times.</b> On the average, total <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> were reduced by 4. 2 %, with a reduction of maximum <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> by 30 %, using the alternative penalties. Conclusion: The use of linear penalties in optimization models for HDR brachytherapy is one cause for undesired longer <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> appearing in mathematically optimized plans. By introducing alternative penalties significant reduction in <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> can be achieved for HDR brachytherapy dose plans. Although various constraints as to reduce the long <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> have been developed our finding is of fundamental interest in showing the shape of the objective function to be one reason for their appearance...|$|R

3000|$|That is, {{when the}} support of ∼T_D [...] increases, lower values of <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> are {{considered}} possible, and for these lower values of <b>dwell</b> <b>times,</b> higher values of maximum capacity are calculated as possible as well.|$|R
30|$|In particular, the {{proposed}} methodology estimates <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> at station by considering, as input, passenger flows, station configurations and a function expressing {{the dependence of}} <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> {{on the number of}} passengers at the most loaded door.|$|R
50|$|The main {{predictor}} of <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> will vary widely by mode, time, and line. However, <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> will, in most cases, probably be {{most affected by}} the number of passengers needing to board and alight from a vehicle.|$|R
25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors {{can be applied}} {{for a short time}} with an overvoltage, also called a surge voltage. The surge voltage indicates the maximum voltage value within the temperature range that may be applied during the lifetime at a frequency of 1000 cycles (with a <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> of 30 seconds and a pause of 5 minutes and 30 seconds in each instance) without causing any visible damage to the capacitor or a capacitance change of more than 15%.|$|E
25|$|Bilevel {{trains are}} {{claimed to be}} more energy efficient, and may have a lower {{operating}} cost per passenger. A bilevel car may carry about {{twice as many as}} a normal car, without requiring double the weight to pull or material to build. However, a bilevel train may take longer to exchange passengers at each station, since more people will enter and exit from each car. The increased <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> makes them most popular on long-distance routes which make fewer stops (and may be popular with passengers for offering a better view).|$|E
25|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of copper is its propensity to stain light-colored building materials, such as marble or limestone. Green staining is particularly visible on light-colored surfaces. Lead-coated copper {{can result in}} a black or gray stain that may blend well with lighter building materials. Staining can be reduced by collecting runoff in gutters and directing it away from the building via downspouts or by designing drip edges to help reduce the amount of copper laden moisture that comes into contact with material below. Coating the adjacent surface of the porous material with a clear silicone sealant also reduces staining. Staining may not develop in areas of rapid run-off due to the short <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> of water on the copper.|$|E
30|$|The {{choice of}} a metro network was no accident: due to the close {{distance}} between two successive stations, <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> are frequently comparable to travel times. Thus, {{the need to provide}} a reliable estimation of <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> becomes even more important.|$|R
30|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to improve urban railway lines {{capacity}} analysis considering the uncertainty associated to <b>dwell</b> <b>times.</b> In these type of lines <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> have an important impact on capacity because there are frequent stops, and running times are quite stable due {{to the use of}} automatic driving systems.|$|R
30|$|In addition, also station {{layout and}} rail {{operations}} affect <b>dwell</b> <b>times.</b> The former includes {{the position of}} access/egress facilities on the platform [34] and train stop type (e.g. short stop or large stations [35]). The latter (i.e. rail operation) presents a relationship of reciprocal influence with <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> at stations, which are key factors in order to optimise the reliability of rail systems [36, 37, 38, 39]. <b>Dwell</b> <b>times</b> {{play an important role}} especially in propagating delays [40, 41, 42, 43]. Indeed, when a first delay occurs, if the timetable is neither stable nor flexible enough, the perturbation propagates and generates secondary delays, reducing service quality and hence passenger satisfaction. In this context, a careful estimate of <b>dwell</b> <b>times,</b> as a function of passenger flows, is the most critical task in order to design a robust timetable and make it able to absorb delays by avoiding disturbance propagation.|$|R
25|$|Architectural copper is, however, {{susceptible}} to corrosive attack under certain conditions. Oxidizing acids, oxidizing heavy-metal salts, alkalis, sulfur and nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and some sulfur and ammonium compounds can expedite copper corrosion. Precipitation {{in areas with}} a pH less than 5.5 may corrode copper, possibly before a patina or protective oxide film has the time to form. Acidic precipitation, known as acid rain, is due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion, chemical manufacturing, or other processes that release sulfur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. Erosion corrosion may occur when acidic water from a non-copper roof that does not neutralise the acidity, such as tile, slate, wood, or asphalt, falls on a small area of copper. Line corrosion can occur if the drip edge of an inert roofing material rests directly on copper. A solution to this may be to raise the lower edge of the shingles with a cant strip, or to provide a replaceable reinforcing strip between the shingles and the copper. Proper water-shedding design and detailing, which reduces the <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> of acidic water on metal surfaces, can prevent the majority of atmospheric corrosion problems.|$|E
25|$|Ground {{was broken}} {{on the project}} in November 1997. Four new {{stations}} {{were added to the}} system: the SFO station, South San Francisco, San Bruno, and Millbrae. The Millbrae station has a cross-platform connection to Caltrain, {{the first of its kind}} west of the Mississippi. The $1.5 billion ($ billion adjusted for inflation) extension of BART southward to San Francisco International Airport's (SFO) Garage G, adjacent to the International Terminal, was opened to the public on June 22, 2003. The right of way had been served by Muni's 40 San Mateo interurban (previously the San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway) streetcar line until 1949. The airport extension between SFO and Millbrae station was initially hosted a shuttle service which operated with two train operators—one on each end of the train—between the San Bruno and Millbrae stations to reduce <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> at SFO during peak hours. The train entered the SFO stub-end station under the control of the primary operator and exited in the opposite direction towards Millbrae controlled by the secondary. Since SFO is now the terminus of the line that serves it, this practice was discontinued as it would not reduce the in-transit time for any trips.|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} study we {{attempted}} to validate a new implicit measure of theory of mind: the self-paced slide show. Many children may possess the ability to perform theory of mind tasks, but may lack the performance abilities to demonstrate their skills to others.

We assessed implicit ability with the measurement of <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> to slide shows depicting the events of classic false belief tasks. The <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> of the children moving through the slide shows were measured; children with a theory of mind should have increased <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> to the slides depicting events relevant to mental states, and in particular to those violating their expectations regarding how actors ought to behave. We predicted that children without a theory of mind should move through the slide shows and have equal <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on all slides even when a character breaks the expected beliefs.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{information}} acquisition strategies of expert and competent non-expert intensive care physicians during two simulated diagnostic scenarios involving respiratory distress in an infant. Specifically, the information acquisition performance of six experts and 12 competent non-experts was examined using an eye tracker during the initial 90 seconds of the assessment of the patient. The results indicated that, in comparison to competent non-experts, experts recorded longer mean fixations, irrespective of the scenario. When the <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> were examined against specific areas of interest, the results revealed that competent non-experts recorded greater overall <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on the nurse, where experts recorded relatively greater <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on the head and face of the manikin.

2500|$|Accordingly, {{several studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that the presentation of emotionally arousing stimuli (compared to neutral stimuli) results in enhanced memory for central details (details central to the appearance or meaning of the emotional stimuli) and impaired memory for peripheral details. Also consistent with this hypothesis are findings of weapon focus effect, in which witnesses to a crime remember the gun or knife in great detail but not other details such as the perpetrator's clothing or vehicle. In laboratory replications it was found that participants spend a disproportionate amount of time looking at a weapon in a scene, and this looking time is inversely related to the likelihood that individuals will subsequently identify the perpetrator of the crime. Other researchers have suggested arousal may also increase the duration of attentional focusing on the arousing stimuli, thus delaying the disengagement of attention from it. [...] Ochsner (2000) summarized the different findings and suggested that by influencing attention selectivity and <b>dwell</b> <b>time,</b> arousing stimuli are more distinctively encoded, resulting in more accurate memory of those stimuli.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2010, the high-energy laser {{was used}} {{in-flight}} to intercept, although not destroy, a test Missile Alternative Range Target Instrument (MARTI) in the boost phase of flight.

Less than an hour after that first missile had been destroyed, a second missile—a solid-fuel design—had, as announced by the MDA, been [...] "successfully engaged", but not destroyed, and that all test criteria had been met.

2500|$|What {{makes this}} {{magnesium}} blockade of the NMDAR channel particularly significant {{in terms of}} LTP induction is that the block is membrane voltage-dependent. [...] The basis of this voltage dependence is relatively straightforward. [...] The NMDAR channel is a transmembrane protein; that is, it spans the cell membrane. As such, it also spans the electric field generated by the membrane potential. [...] The magnesium binding site within the NMDAR channel is physically located within this electric field. [...] Magnesium ions carrying a double positive charge can be acted upon by the field. [...] When the cell is hyperpolarized, magnesium is stabilized inside the channel (i.e. the two positive charges on the magnesium ion are attracted toward the negative pole of the electric field, which points toward {{the inside of the}} cell). [...] As a cell is depolarized, the field effect on the magnesium ion weakens, and the <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> of magnesium ions within the channel decreases. [...] Thus, the kinetics of the binding reaction between magnesium and the NMDAR channel are such that magnesium periodically unbinds and leaves the channel, only to be replaced by another magnesium ion. [...] During the (very brief) time that the magnesium is absent from the open channel, other ions (such as sodium and calcium) can flow through the channel. [...] However, when the cell is more hyperpolarized, the bound state of magnesium is stabilized and it leaves the channel less often and for a shorter period of time (on average). [...] When the cell is less hyperpolarized, the magnesium leaves the channel more often and stays away for longer (on average). [...] Hence, the magnesium blockade of the open NMDAR channel is membrane voltage-dependent.|$|E
