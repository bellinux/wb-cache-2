5|$|General {{elections}} were again held in Zimbabwe on 30 March 2008. The official results required a runoff between Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader; the MDC challenged these results, claiming widespread <b>election</b> <b>fraud</b> by the Mugabe government.|$|E
5|$|Powell Clayton, a 35-year-old former Brigadier General in the Union Army who {{remained}} in Arkansas after marrying an Arkansas woman, was elected governor as a Republican in April, 1868. The election was scarred with irregularities. For example, the return of votes in Pulaski County exceeded the number of registered voters. Also, the registrars, who controlled the distribution of ballots, admitted that they had given ballots to voters from other counties if they could show a valid registration certificate. Both sides claimed <b>election</b> <b>fraud</b> and voter intimidation: armed parties had been stationed on roads to keep voters away from the polls. General Gillem, commander of the military district that included Arkansas, wrote to General Grant {{that it would take}} months to sort out which side had committed the greater <b>election</b> <b>fraud.</b>|$|E
5|$|Presidential {{elections}} were again held in 2002 amid allegations of vote-rigging, intimidation and fraud.

5|$|Another colony lost by Spain in 1898 was Cuba, but {{as freedom}} for Cuba {{had been a}} major purpose of the war, it was not annexed by the U.S., but was, {{after a period of}} occupation, given {{independence}} in 1902. <b>Election</b> <b>fraud</b> and corruption followed, as did factional conflict. In September 1906, President Tomás Estrada Palma asked for U.S. intervention. Taft traveled to Cuba with a small American force, and on September 29, 1906, {{under the terms of the}} Cuban–American Treaty of Relations of 1903, declared himself Provisional Governor of Cuba, a post he held for two weeks before being succeeded by Charles Edward Magoon. In his time in Cuba, Taft worked to persuade Cubans that the U.S. intended stability, not occupation.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{supported}} Ernst, and Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover campaigned in {{the state}} on his behalf. Ernst had opposed a bonus for veterans of World War I, an unpopular position in Kentucky, and at 68 years old, his age worked against him. Barkley contrasted his impoverished upbringing with Ernst's affluent lifestyle as a corporate lawyer, and also attacked him for supporting Michigan Senator Truman Handy Newberry, who resigned due to allegations of <b>election</b> <b>fraud.</b> Republican voters were angered that Ernst did not support Republican Kentucky Congressman John W. Langley when Langley was charged with illegally aiding a large bootlegging operation in Louisville. Ernst tried to resurrect the issues of Barkley's support for the coal tax and opposition to parimutuel betting, but in the general election, Barkley won {{by a vote of}} 287,997 to 266,657.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{government}} formulated procedural regulations ostensibly {{designed to}} ensure results and ballots were correctly accounted for and to prevent <b>election</b> <b>fraud.</b> In reality however, the votes were counted without independent supervision, which resulted in Diệm being credited with 98.2% of the vote. The prime minister tallied 605,025 votes in Saigon, although only 450,000 voters were registered in the capital. Diệm's tally exceeded the registration numbers in other districts. French newspapers claimed that {{only half of the}} registered voters in Saigon had actually voted, and that the rest had boycotted the election, implying that more than 60% of the votes in the capital were not authentic. Defenders of Diệm claim this was due to recently arrived, mostly Catholic, refugees from North Vietnam who voted without being enrolled, rather than large-scale ballot stuffing.|$|E

5|$|Diệm {{addressed}} the Parliament of Australia and was made an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George, {{one of the}} highest imperial honours that can be bestowed on a non-British subject—at the time, Australians were also British subjects. Diệm did not engage in substantive political discussions with the Australian leaders and {{he spent most of his}} time at public functions. He was universally extolled by the media, which praised him for what they perceived to be a successful, charismatic, democratic and righteous rule in South Vietnam, overlooking his authoritarianism, <b>election</b> <b>fraud</b> and other corrupt practices. The Australian Catholic leadership and media were particularly glowing towards the South Vietnamese head of state. A member of Vietnam's Catholic minority and the brother of Vietnam's leading archbishop, Diệm had pursued policies in Vietnam favoring his co-religionists. He exempted the Catholic Church from land redistribution, gave them more aid and job promotions, and allowed Catholic paramilitaries to attack Buddhists, who formed the religious majority.|$|E
