50|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>disability</b> {{is defined}} by the WHO as a {{reduction}} in ability to hear sounds in quiet and background noise (compared to people with normal hearing), which is caused by a hearing impairment. Several studies have investigated whether self-reported hearing problems (via questionnaires and interviews) were associated with the results from PTA. The findings of these studies indicate that in general, the results of PTA correspond to self-reported hearing problems (i.e. <b>hearing</b> <b>disability).</b> However, for some individuals this is not the case. Therefore, the results of PTA cannot be used to ascertain an individual's <b>hearing</b> <b>disability.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the first case of {{educational}} practice for children with disabilities in Okinawa Prefecture. It was a class specifically targeted at children with visual or <b>hearing</b> <b>disabilities</b> and was developed in Tokeshi elementary school by Ishun Yonamine, the principal of the school at the time. This paper attempts to clarify the actual status of the class, using mainly a report by Yonamine, which was found recently in an old issue of educational magazine. The report was based on his experiences with educational practice for children with visual or <b>hearing</b> <b>disabilities.</b> The results of this study were as follows; 1) It is likely that the practice of special class started in 1906, because the head of Nakagami County ordered Tokeshi elementary school to decrease the children who could not enter school and Yonamine had been much interested in educating these children with special needs. 2) The students of the class were those with visual or <b>hearing</b> <b>disabilities</b> in the school district, and 3) The class was closed down in 1908 when Yonamine went to Tokyo to study education for children with visual or <b>hearing</b> <b>disabilities.</b> While he was studying in Tokyo, he was forced to transfer from Tokeshi elementary school to a different school.
