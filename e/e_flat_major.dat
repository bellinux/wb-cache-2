500|$|The second {{movement}} in four sections {{consists of an}} [...] "exposition", a fast fugue, a slow fugue and a brief coda. The music bursts in at B major and continues with great conflicts between instruments, until a broad, calm theme {{is found in the}} slow fugue. At the closure it pivots on the dominant of <b>E</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> key; various parameters collide and “fall together” into an uplifting 23-bar conclusion.|$|E
500|$|The second Part {{begins in}} G minor, a key which, in Hogwood's phrase, brings {{a mood of}} [...] "tragic presentiment" [...] to the long {{sequence}} of Passion numbers which follows. The declamatory opening chorus [...] "Behold the Lamb of God", in fugal form, {{is followed by the}} alto solo [...] "He was despised" [...] in <b>E</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major,</b> the longest single item in the oratorio, in which some phrases are sung unaccompanied to emphasise Christ's abandonment. Luckett records Burney's description of this number as [...] "the highest idea of excellence in pathetic expression of any English song". The subsequent series of mainly short choral movements cover Christ's Passion, Crucifixion, Death and Resurrection, at first in F minor, with a brief F major respite in [...] "All we like sheep". Here, Handel's use of Nò, di voi non vo'fidarmi has Sedley Taylor's unqualified approval: [...] " [...] bids the voices enter in solemn canonical sequence, and his chorus ends with a combination of grandeur and depth of feeling such as is at the command of consummate genius only".|$|E
500|$|... (Holy), in {{contrast}} with other compositions of mass and Requiem where it is often illustrated with great vocal and instrumental forces (particularly Verdi's Requiem), is here expressed in extremely simple form. The sopranos sing softly in a very simple rising and falling melody of only three notes, which the male voices repeat, accompanied by arpeggios on the harp and a dreamy rising melody in the violins (sometimes just a solo violin). The pattern appears several times, with the melodies increasing in ambitus, and the volume reaching forte on [...] "" [...] (the highest). The orchestra changes tone, the dreamy accompaniment is replaced by firm and powerful major chords with a horn fanfare marked forte, and the male voices declare [...] "" [...] (praise in the highest). This is answered by the sopranos in diminuendo, and the music softens and reverts to the dreamy harp arpeggios that it began with as the violin melody floats upwards to the final note in <b>E</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> and the full choir repeats,with the altos finally joining: [...] "".|$|E
5000|$|... "Cirrus Minor" [...] has {{an unusual}} chord sequence: <b>E</b> minor, <b>E</b> <b>flat</b> augmented, G <b>major,</b> C# minor 7, C major 7, C minor 7 and B 7. The chords are {{built around the}} chromatically {{descending}} bass line. The B 7, C major 7 and G major chords are the only chords which fit into the functional context of the E minor key. This chord sequence gives the song a very surreal atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|Sally’s arietta has {{a rounded}} binary form, {{with the first}} section {{characterized}} by a repetitive eighth note pattern on the words “I want to buy that hat of peacock feathers!” The line is sung over pulsating <b>E</b> <b>flat</b> and B <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> triads. The second section shifts to a bi-tonal suggestion of a C <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> melody over an A <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> accompaniment, {{before returning to the}} original driving eighth note theme.|$|R

50|$|The first {{phrase of}} this concerto begins ambiguously.

2500|$|In Giorgio Pestelli's view, Sacchini's music did {{not attempt}} to match the early Romanticism of the libretto: [...] "Guillard had very {{promptly}} presented Sacchini with a libretto full of early romantic sensibility, embracing the ideas of nature and night , the attraction of terror, Ossian, and the Breton forests. But this romanticism did not affect the music, which remains oriented towards the heroic style, with four-square cadences and wide intervals. Only in the choruses of the bards are more interesting protractions noticeable, as in the 'Symphonie douce et majestueuse' in <b>E</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> in Act II, which is tinged with the priestly and masonic solemnity that was to re-echo in Mozart's Die Zauberflőte two years later." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goss {{composed}} {{a small amount}} of orchestral music in this period. Two overtures, in F minor and <b>E</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major,</b> written circa 1824, were performed and published in 1827, with considerable success. He composed incidental music for John Banim's melodrama The Serjeant's Wife, performed at the English Opera House on 24 July 1827. The Observers sole comment on the composer's contribution was, [...] "The music, which is by Mr. Goss, neither delights nor offends." [...] Thereafter, Goss avoided orchestral composition, declining a request from the Philharmonic Society of London for another orchestral piece in 1833. As a composer, Goss became known for his vocal music. His solo songs and glees were much performed and were well reviewed in the musical press.|$|E
2500|$|Especially {{important}} is Rachmaninoff's use of unusually widely spaced chords for bell-like sounds: this occurs in many pieces, {{most notably in}} the choral symphony The Bells, the Second Piano Concerto, the <b>E</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> Étude-Tableaux (Op.33, [...] ), and the B-minor Prelude (Op.32, [...] ). [...] "It {{is not enough to}} say that the church bells of Novgorod, St Petersburg and Moscow influenced Rachmaninov and feature prominently in his music. This much is self-evident. What is extraordinary is the variety of bell sounds and breadth of structural and other functions they fulfil." [...] He was also fond of Russian Orthodox chants. He uses them most perceptibly in his Vespers, but many of his melodies found their origins in these chants. The opening melody of the First Symphony is derived from chants. (The opening melody of the Third Piano Concerto, on the other hand, is not derived from chants; when asked, Rachmaninoff said that [...] "it had written itself".) ...|$|E

50|$|This sound clip is {{a recent}} example of CWM and {{demonstrates}} the variety available within these boundaries: Strength will rise (Everlasting God). With {{the exception of one}} 2/4 bar shortly before the chorus, rhythmic variety is achieved by syncopation, most notably in the short section leading into the chorus, and in flowing one line into the next. The use of a pedal note at the opening secures the piece firmly in B <b>flat</b> <b>major,</b> and the whole piece uses only four chords: B <b>flat</b> (tonic), <b>E</b> <b>flat</b> (subdominant) and G minor (submediant), and just two references to F (dominant) as it leads into the chorus.
