25|$|Only biopsy of {{suspicious}} lesions in {{the brain}} or elsewhere is considered useful for a definitive diagnosis of neurosarcoid. This would demonstrate granulomas (collections of inflammatory cells) rich in <b>epithelioid</b> cells and surrounded by other immune system cells (e.g. plasma cells, mast cells). Biopsy may be performed to distinguish mass lesions from tumours (e.g. gliomas).|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} English-language case reports found that serious adverse events associated with acupuncture are rare, but that acupuncture is not without risk. Between 2000 and 2011 the English-language literature from 25 countries and regions reported 294 adverse events. The majority of the reported adverse events were relatively minor, and the incidences were low. For example, a prospective survey of 34,000 acupuncture treatments found no serious adverse events and 43 minor ones, a rate of 1.3 per 1000 interventions. Another survey found there were 7.1% minor adverse events, of which 5 were serious, amid 97,733 acupuncture patients. The most common adverse effect observed was infection (e.g. mycobacterium), {{and the majority of}} infections were bacterial in nature, caused by skin contact at the needling site. Infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting. Other adverse complications included five reported cases of spinal cord injuries (e.g. migrating broken needles or needling too deeply), four brain injuries, four peripheral nerve injuries, five heart injuries, seven other organ and tissue injuries, bilateral hand edema, <b>epithelioid</b> granuloma, pseudolymphoma, argyria, pustules, pancytopenia, and scarring due to hot-needle technique. Adverse reactions from acupuncture, which are unusual and uncommon in typical acupuncture practice, included syncope, galactorrhoea, bilateral nystagmus, pyoderma gangrenosum, hepatotoxicity, eruptive lichen planus, and spontaneous needle migration.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} main {{histological}} subtypes of malignant mesothelioma: <b>epithelioid,</b> sarcomatous, and biphasic. <b>Epithelioid</b> and biphasic mesothelioma make up approximately 75-95% of mesotheliomas {{and have been}} well characterized histologically, whereas sarcomatous mesothelioma has not been studied extensively. Most mesotheliomas express high levels of cytokeratin 5 regardless of subtype.|$|E

50|$|<b>Epithelioid</b> sarcoma (especially {{advanced}} stage, recurrent, or metastasized disease) {{has been}} shown to be resistant to traditional cancer therapies, necessitating further exploration of novel treatment methods and techniques. Because of the relatively poor response of <b>epithelioid</b> sarcoma to traditional cancer treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation), new treatment strategies are being looked to.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Epithelioid</b> sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma is an {{exceedingly}} rare vascular tumor of intermediate grade that was first described by Steven Billings, Andrew Folpe, and Sharon Weiss in 2003. These tumors are {{so named because}} their histologic appearance {{is very similar to}} that of <b>epithelioid</b> sarcoma, a more malignant tumor with which they are commonly mistaken.|$|E
50|$|<b>Epithelioid</b> histiocytes (<b>Epithelioid</b> cells) are {{activated}} macrophages resembling epithelial cells: elongated, with finely granular, pale eosinophilic (pink) cytoplasm and central, ovoid nucleus (oval or elongate), {{which is}} less dense {{than that of a}} lymphocyte. They have indistinct shape contour, often appear to merge into one another and can form aggregates known as giant cells.|$|E
5000|$|The perineurium is {{composed}} of connective tissue, which has a distinctly lamellar arrangement consisting of roughly seven to eight concentric layers. The perineurium is cellular, and {{is composed}} of perineurial cells, which are <b>epithelioid</b> myofibroblasts. Perineurial cells are {{sometimes referred to as}} myoepithelioid due to their <b>epithelioid</b> and myofibroblastoid properties including tight junctions, gap junctions, external laminae and contractility.|$|E
50|$|<b>Epithelioid</b> sarcoma most {{commonly}} strikes young adults, yet no age group is immune. The disease {{has a tendency}} to develop local recurrences and metastasis thereafter to regional lymph nodes, lung, bone, brain, and other locations, including the scalp. Generally speaking, <b>epithelioid</b> sarcoma has a high rate of relapse after initial treatment and tends to recur locally (at or near the original tumor site). <b>Epithelioid</b> sarcoma also demonstrates lymphatic spread (in 22-48% of cases), and metastasis (in 21-63% of cases). These events, as well as advanced stage (progression) and grade (aggressiveness), are predictive of an overall worse outcome. The overall five-year survival rate for <b>epithelioid</b> sarcoma is anywhere from 25 to 78%. Importantly, the 10-year and 15-year survival rate drops off significantly. Associated with a more positive outcome are younger age, female vs. male sex, distal vs. proximal location, smaller tumor size, and negative margins upon tumor resection.|$|E

50|$|The Sonic {{hedgehog}} and Notch signaling pathways {{are also}} suspected to be up-regulated in <b>epithelioid</b> sarcoma. These cell signaling pathways control cellular proliferation and differentiation. They are {{also involved in}} cancer stem cell coordination and disease invasiveness and metastasis. Hhat inhibitors (such as RU-SKI 43) block the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway by inhibiting hedgehog palmitoyl acytl-transferase. Current trials are investigating Notch inhibitors against <b>epithelioid</b> sarcoma.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} genetic {{mutation}} (found in 80-90% of <b>epithelioid</b> sarcomas) is the inactivation of the SMARCB1 gene, or {{the loss of}} INI-1 function, which {{is thought to be}} a major contributor to disease progression. <b>Epithelioid</b> sarcoma typically contains chromosome 22q11.2 mutations or deletions and 8q gains, particularly i(8) (>q10). Aberrations of 18q and 8q, as well as recurrent gains at 11q13, have also been observed. The SMARCB1 gene (also termed BAF47, INI1, or hSNF5) is located on chromosome 22q11.2 and codes for a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Loss of SMARCB1 function is the most common genetic mutation observed in <b>epithelioid</b> sarcoma, and this dysfunction is likely a major driver of disease progression. SMARCB1 is a core protein subunit of the 15 subunit SWI/SNF (or BAF) complex involved in regulating the nucleosome architecture of our genome and {{has been shown to be}} a potent tumor suppressor gene, meaning that its primary role is to control cell division and to even halt division under appropriate circumstances (i.e. signals to over-replicate). As this tumor suppressor is commonly inactivated in <b>epithelioid</b> sarcoma, cell division can fail to appropriately halt, resulting in unregulated cellular growth and the formation of cancer tumors. Several research teams are currently developing techniques to reverse this loss of genetic function characteristic of <b>epithelioid</b> sarcoma.|$|E

50|$|Cyclin D1 is {{a protein}} {{requisite}} for cell cycle progression {{and has been}} shown to be up-regulated in <b>epithelioid</b> sarcoma. Cyclin D-1 is a regulator of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6). It {{has been shown to}} interact with the retinoblastoma protein (a tumor suppressor gene), CDK4 and CDK6, thyroid hormone receptor beta, and nuclear receptor coactivator 1, among others. Cyclin D and CDKs promote cell cycle progression by releasing transcription factors that are important for the initiation of DNA replication. Abnormal levels of cyclin D-1 may promote rapid cell division in <b>epithelioid</b> sarcoma.|$|E
50|$|Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, such as vorinostat, {{have shown}} some promise in <b>epithelioid</b> sarcoma. Researchers in Texas are {{investigating}} {{whether or not}} HDAC inhibitors can reverse the loss of INI1 function that is characteristic of <b>epithelioid</b> sarcoma. HDAC inhibitors work by blocking events involved in DNA replication and, therefore, in cell division. Blocking HDAC {{has been shown to}} encourage cancer cells to enter apoptosis. Interestingly, several dietary phytochemicals {{have been shown to be}} effective HDAC inhibitors. These include sulphorphane, indole-3-carbinol, and phenethyl isothiocyanates, found in broccoli, kale, and watercress, and epigallocatecehin-3-gallate, found in green tea.|$|E
