5|$|As far as {{the ground}} water {{necessary}} for the conversion could penetrate, the pyrite-carbonate was converted to a usable brown <b>hematite</b> iron ore along the outcrops and near the bedrock surface.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hematite</b> ore was {{converted}} to pig iron in charcoal-fired stone blast furnaces that were constructed throughout the Juniata River region near the workable ore deposits from the Marcellus and other formations.|$|E
5|$|Pots and vessels {{were also}} recovered. Pots {{were used for}} cooking, while the large vessels for food import from Oman and Mesopotamia. Artifacts found there {{indicates}} the location. These include a cuneiform inscription and <b>hematite,</b> both of which link to Mesopotamia; steatite bowls to Oman; and carnelian beads, a stone weight and a few potsherds to the Indus Civilization.|$|E
5|$|Elcor sat atop {{a bed of}} {{taconite}} {{consisting of}} a uniform mixture of about 30% iron, interspersed with pockets of high-grade ore, {{a part of the}} Biwabik iron formation. The Biwabik iron formation is a large sheet of iron-bearing sediment deposited during the Precambrian era {{on the bottom of the}} Animikie Sea. This iron-bearing rock extends under Lake Superior from the Mesabi and Vermilion Iron Ranges, to the Gogebic Iron Range from northern Wisconsin into the Marquette Range of the upper peninsula of Michigan, and west to the manganese-rich ore of the Cuyuna Iron Range. Michigan's steel-blue high grade ores were quite different from the Mesabi ore, which was soft brown <b>hematite.</b> There is iron in other areas of Minnesota, but no longer in quantities that are practical to mine.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} from the CRISM team reported on 9 to 10 different classes of minerals formed in the presence of water. Different types of clays (also called phyllosilicates) were found in many locations. The physilicates identified included aluminum smectite, iron/magnesium smectite, kaolinite, prehnite, and chlorite. Rocks containing carbonate were found around the Isidis basin. Carbonates belong to one class in which life could have developed. Areas around Valles Marineris were found to contain hydrated silica and hydrated sulfates. The researchers identified hydrated sulfates and ferric minerals in Terra Meridiani and in Valles Marineris. Other minerals found on Mars were jarosite, alunite, <b>hematite,</b> opal, and gypsum. Two to five of the mineral classes were formed with the right pH and sufficient water to permit life to grow.|$|E
5|$|Mars is a {{terrestrial}} planet {{that consists of}} minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. The surface of Mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of <b>hematite</b> and olivine have been found. Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.|$|E
5|$|Metallic or native iron {{is rarely}} {{found on the}} surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are {{pervasive}} and represent the primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen, silicon, and aluminium. Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as <b>hematite</b> (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and siderite (FeCO3). Many igneous rocks also contain the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite and pentlandite.|$|E
5|$|Several {{minerals}} {{used for}} paint pigments were excavated from Chetro Ketl, including charcoal, shale, malachite, iron oxides, <b>hematite,</b> limonite, gypsum, and azurite. Twined sandals, and bones from the ferruginous hawk {{and the great}} horned owl have been found there. The relative lack of exotic material uncovered at Chetro Ketl, such as shells, copper bells, and macaw feathers, may indicate its lesser importance compared to Pueblo Bonito, where those items {{have been found in}} abundance. Because Chetro Ketl has only been partially excavated definitive conclusions remain elusive. In 1937, W. W. Postlethwaite, who had for three seasons directed Hewett's excavation of Chetro Ketl's great kiva, oversaw the final work at the site conducted by the University of New Mexico and the School of American Research.|$|E
5|$|The large armlet of pierced gold (opus interrasile) showed {{traces of}} <b>hematite</b> {{on the reverse}} side, which {{probably}} would have been used as a type of jeweller's rouge. This is the earliest known and documented use of this technique on Roman jewellery. Gilt items showed the presence of mercury, indicating the mercury gilding technique. The black inlay on the cast silver tigress shows the niello technique, but with silver sulphide rather than lead sulphide. The settings of stones where garnet and amethyst remain, in the body chain, have vacant places presumed to be where pearls were set, and show elemental sulphur as adhesive or filler.|$|E
5|$|Five single {{sheets of}} bark paper were found {{associated}} with the codex, they had no stucco coating and were brown and water stained. Two of these had adhered to the codex {{and the other three}} may have once been with the codex but had separated. One of these sheets had a painted line in the same red <b>hematite</b> pigment used in the codex itself. A smaller sheet of bark paper was attached to the lined sheet and this smaller piece was submitted for radiocarbon dating. This testing produced a date for the sheet of AD 1230 ± 130; this would date the document {{to the end of the}} Early Postclassic period (c. 950–1200) and would make the codex the oldest known surviving Mesoamerican codex. The lack of incrustations or insect damage to the codex suggests that, if genuine, it was stored inside a container for hundreds of years. The overall damaged state of the codex conflicts with the good preservation of surviving parts; it may be that the damaged codex was deliberately decommissioned as a ritual object, rather than being simply discarded.|$|E
5|$|Uplift {{from the}} Laramide paused {{briefly in the}} Eocene. Meandering streams flowed slowly over the {{resulting}} broad and almost featureless plains. Periodic but extensive floods inundated large areas perhaps once every 1,000 years; spreading mud, cobbles and fine silt over the plains. Erosion incised these deposits between flood events and plant growth was abundant. Oxidation of the iron {{in the mud and}} silt turned the soil into <b>hematite,</b> giving it a pink and red hue. These sediments were later lithified into the up-to- -thick Pink Member of the locally Eocene-aged Claron Formation (previously called the Wasatch Formation). Channelized conglomerates of this member can be easily seen in Red Canyon along State Route 12 while its silt and mudstones compose most of the park's fragile and colorful spires called hoodoos. Geologist Clarence Dutton called the iron oxide-rich lower member of the Claron the Pink Cliffs series due to its colorful appearance.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic of the Roman times iron {{industry}} were huge centers of metallurgy. One such concentration of ironworks, in Świętokrzyskie Mountains, which already produced iron on an industrial {{scale in the}} 1st century AD, in the 2nd and 3rd centuries became Barbaricum's largest. It may {{have been responsible for}} the majority of the iron supplied for barbarian weapon production during the Marcomannic Wars. The iron product was obtained in rather small, single-use smelting furnaces. One furnace's iron output was from a few to 20kg, which required 10 to 200kg of ore and the same amount of charcoal. The satisfaction of so much need for charcoal caused significant deforestation of the areas surrounding the iron centers. Not only turf, but also <b>hematite</b> ores were utilized, which involved building mines and shafts to provide access. The furnaces in Świętokrzyskie Mountains were grouped into large complexes, located in forested areas, away from human settlements. There could have had been as many as 700,000 smelting furnaces built in that area; one big concentration of the Przeworsk culture's spent furnaces (2nd-3rd centuries) was located in Nowa Słupia, Kielce County. The second largest iron production center functioned at that time in Masovia, west of Warsaw, with the total number of furnaces there, in which only turf ores were used, estimated at up to 200,000. They were operated as very large complexes, with several thousand furnaces at a time located near populated areas, where intermediate products were processed further. Those two great concentrations of metallurgical industry produced iron largely for long distance trade; to fulfill local requirements and on smaller scale iron was obtained at a number of other locations.|$|E
5|$|Each page of {{the codex}} has been painted on one side with a {{standing}} figure facing left. Each figure holds a weapon and most grip a rope leading to a restrained captive. Colours used on the codex include <b>hematite</b> red, black, blue-green, a red wash and a brown wash, all upon a strong white background. The left-hand side of each page {{is marked by a}} column of day signs; where this column is complete these total thirteen in all. Each day sign is associated with a bar-and-dot numerical coefficient. Six pages depict a figure bearing weapons and accompanied by a captive (pages 1–4, 6 and 9), two pages (5 and 8) both depict a figure hurling a dart at a temple. Page 7 of the codex shows a passive warrior {{standing in front of a}} tree. Page 11 depicts a death god with a javelin, pointing his weapon at a water vessel containing a snail. Page 10 is a badly damaged fragment with the subject largely obliterated. Based on the surviving portion, Michael Coe thought it depicted a standing figure wearing a waterbird headdress and bearing an atlatl. The figures represented on each page differ from those on the other Maya codices and are far more similar to the Mixtec codices and Toltec art styles of central Mexico. The heads of the death gods painted in the Grolier Codex are almost identical to those represented in the Laud Codex and Fejérváry-Mayer Codex, including the red colouring of the portion of the teeth closest to the gums.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, <b>hematite,</b> and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E
5|$|The {{preliminaries}} to the furnace's construction {{began in}} 1885, when Valentine and Thomas, an old ironmaking firm of Bellefonte, {{decided to sell}} off its properties. These then consisted of Bellefonte Forge, on Logan Branch just south of Bellefonte, and Bellefonte Furnace, a cold blast charcoal iron furnace lying about a mile south of the town, also on Logan Branch, as well as holdings in local iron ore mines. Both plants were served by the Bellefonte, Nittany and Lemont Railroad, {{a subsidiary of the}} PRR. The ironworks and ore lands were bought on August 2, 1886, for $400,000, by the Valentine Ore Land Association, whose principals organized the Centre Iron Company to erect a new iron furnace on the site of Bellefonte Furnace, which was to be torn down. A $600,000 mortgage was immediately raised on the properties, to supply the purchase money and funds for rebuilding the furnace. The leaders of the company included Edmund Blanchard, W. M. Stewart, and B. K. Jamison, a Philadelphia banker. The plant was built in 1887, and the Nittany Valley Railroad was built to supply it with ore. It became necessary to raise additional funds, and in 1887, the Pennsylvania Railroad purchased $75,000 worth of bonds in exchange for exclusive rights to rail traffic to and from the furnace. The first load of ore was delivered by the Nittany Valley on February 28, 1888, and the furnace went into blast on March 4, 1888. The company was originally headed by Jamison, but by 1890, James B. Coryell was president and Jamison vice-president. At this time, the furnace had one 70-foot (21-meter) stack and three hot-blast stoves, with a capacity of 30,000tons (27,200tonnes) of iron per year. Ore was supplied from local <b>hematite</b> deposits, and the furnace was fuelled by Connellsville coke. In the same year, however, the failure of Jamison's bank precipitated the closure of the furnace by the sheriff on November 15, 1890. It was subsequently sold under foreclosure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hematite</b> is colored {{black to}} steel or silver-gray, brown to reddish brown, or red. It is mined {{as the main}} ore of iron. Varieties include kidney ore, martite (pseudomorphs after magnetite), iron rose and specularite (specular <b>hematite).</b> While the forms of <b>hematite</b> vary, they all have a rust-red streak. <b>Hematite</b> is harder than pure iron, but much more brittle. Maghemite is a hematite- and magnetite-related oxide mineral.|$|E
25|$|Ochre is a clay that is {{colored by}} varying amounts of <b>hematite,</b> varying between 20% and 70%. Red ochre {{contains}} unhydrated <b>hematite,</b> whereas yellow ochre contains hydrated <b>hematite</b> (Fe2O3 • H2O). The principal use of ochre is for tinting {{with a permanent}} color.|$|E
25|$|Ores most {{commonly}} used in Tannerre were red <b>hematite</b> (Fe2O3)O3), one of several iron oxides. <b>Hematite</b> also contains traces of titanium (Ti), aluminium (Al), manganese (Mn) and water (H2O). (local <b>hematite</b> bearing a 70% iron content) and limonite (FeO(OH).nH2O),O is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. an hydroxide <b>hematite</b> (here with 60% iron content). Marcasite, an iron sulfide (FeSFe2), was little used.|$|E
25|$|Hematite's {{popularity}} in jewelry {{was at its}} highest in Europe during the Victorian era. Certain types of <b>hematite</b> or iron oxide-rich clay, especially Armenian bole, {{have been used in}} gilding. <b>Hematite</b> is also used in art such as in the creation of intaglio engraved gems. Hematine is a synthetic material sold as magnetic <b>hematite.</b>|$|E
25|$|Huge {{deposits}} of <b>hematite</b> {{are found in}} banded iron formations. Gray <b>hematite</b> is typically found in places that can have still standing water or mineral hot springs, {{such as those in}} Yellowstone National Park in North America. The mineral can precipitate out of water and collect in layers {{at the bottom of a}} lake, spring, or other standing water. <b>Hematite</b> can also occur without water, however, usually as the result of volcanic activity.|$|E
25|$|West <b>Hematite</b> {{used the}} Code Letters LRGF from 1930 and KLCS from 1934. Irish Pine used the Code Letters EINQ.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, ferric oxides in {{the form}} of {{crystalline}} grey <b>hematite</b> that probably required water for its formation have been found.|$|E

25|$|In the Middle Ages,Barrow {{was a small}} hamlet with Furness Abbey, on the {{outskirts}} of the modern-day town, controlling the local economy before its dissolution in 1537. The iron prospector Henry Schneider arrived in Furness in 1839 and, with other investors, opened the Furness Railway in 1846 to transport iron ore and slate from local mines to the coast. Further <b>hematite</b> deposits were discovered, of sufficient size to develop factories for smelting and exporting steel. By the late 19th century, the Barrow <b>Hematite</b> Steel Company-owned steelworks was the world's largest.|$|E
25|$|The mound zone {{consists}} of laminated massive to brecciated pyrite, sphalerite (+/-galena), <b>hematite,</b> and barite. The mound can {{be up to}} several tens of metres thick and several hundred metres in diameter.|$|E
25|$|The Clinton Formation, {{a band of}} red <b>hematite</b> {{across the}} county, led to a {{thriving}} iron industry during the 19th century. Furnaces were located in the Towns of Ontario and Wolcott.|$|E
25|$|Enhanced {{magnetic}} coercivities for <b>hematite</b> {{have been}} achieved by dry-heating a 2-line ferrihydrite precursor prepared from solution. <b>Hematite</b> exhibited temperature-dependent magnetic coercivity values ranging from 289 to 5,027 Oe. The origin of these high coercivity values has been interpreted {{as a consequence of}} the subparticle structure induced by the different particle and crystallite size growth rates at increasing annealing temperature. These differences in the growth rates are translated into a progressive development of a subparticle structure at the nanoscale. At lower temperatures (350–600°C), single particles crystallize however; at higher temperatures (600-1000°C), the growth of crystalline aggregates with a subparticle structure is favored.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} {{structure of}} a-hematite {{was the subject}} of considerable discussion and debate in the 1950s because it appeared to be ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of around 1000 K, but with an extremely tiny magnetic moment (0.002 µB). Adding to the surprise was a transition with a decrease in temperature at around 260 K to a phase with no net magnetic moment. It was shown that the system is essentially antiferromagnetic, but that the low symmetry of the cation sites allows spin–orbit coupling to cause canting of the moments when they are in the plane perpendicular to the c axis. The disappearance of the moment with a decrease in temperature at 260 K is caused by a change in the anisotropy which causes the moments to align along the c axis. In this configuration, spin canting does not reduce the energy. The magnetic properties of bulk <b>hematite</b> differ from their nanoscale counterparts. For example, the Morin transition temperature of <b>hematite</b> decreases with a decrease in the particle size. The suppression of this transition has also been observed in some of the <b>hematite</b> nanoparticles, and the presence of impurities, water molecules and defects in the crystals were attributed to the absence of a Morin transition. <b>Hematite</b> is part of a complex solid solution oxyhydroxide system having various contents of water, hydroxyl groups and vacancy substitutions that affect the mineral's magnetic and crystal chemical properties. Two other end-members are referred to as protohematite and hydrohematite.|$|E
25|$|The 1902 annual {{general meeting}} {{confirmed}} that the expansion was complete, voted a similar dividend and re-elected William Johnson Galloway and Charles Rought as directors; it also noted that an order for a blowing machine from Carnforth <b>Hematite</b> was being processed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hematite</b> is an antiferromagnetic {{material}} below the Morin transition at 250kelvin (K) or -9.7degrees Fahrenheit (°F), and a canted antiferromagnet or weakly ferromagnetic above the Morin transition and below its Néel temperature at 948 K, above {{which it is}} paramagnetic.|$|E
25|$|Nickel {{mineralisation}} in the regolith, in {{the upper}} saprolite typically exists as goethite, <b>hematite,</b> limonite and {{is often associated with}} polydymite and violarite, nickel sulfides which are of supergene association. Within the lower saprolite, violarite is transitional with unaltered pentlandite-pyrite-pyrrhotite ore.|$|E
25|$|Marquette {{continues}} to be a shipping port for <b>hematite</b> ores and, today, enriched iron ore pellets, from nearby mines and pelletizing plants. About 7.9 million gross tons of pelletized iron ore passed through Marquette's Presque Isle Harbor in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Clay-sized <b>hematite</b> {{crystals}} {{can also}} {{occur as a}} secondary mineral formed by weathering processes in soil, and along with other iron oxides or oxyhydroxides such as goethite, {{is responsible for the}} red color of many tropical, ancient, or otherwise highly weathered soils.|$|E
25|$|Minerals {{produced}} through {{hydrothermal alteration}} and weathering of primary basaltic minerals are also present on Mars.
