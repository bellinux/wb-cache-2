6000|$|... "You {{laugh at}} me; {{but you need}} not. I play for you because <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> terribly. If I sent you those flowers, {{it was not to}} be rude. It was my {{gratitude}} for the pleasure of your face." [...] His voice actually trembled. And, looking down, Gyp answered: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes--yes!... Marcia, {{you are a}} brave woman. You {{have the}} courage of the great women of history. I can no longer love; but <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> from my soul!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you?" [...] cried Hadden. [...] "Well, I {{must say}} <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you.</b> You're a regular sage. It's {{what you call}} Pythagoreanism, isn't it? if I haven't {{forgotten}} my philosophy." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{you came}} to-night, so calm and self-possessed, <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> <b>you</b> as I'd never <b>admired</b> <b>you</b> before.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{then you}} {{came along and}} you were so good to me. And <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> <b>you</b> because you were clever {{and it was so}} heavenly to have someone I could put my trust in. I loved you. I never thought it could come to an end. And without any fault of mine at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{was very}} pert {{with you all}} day,--and I don't think I'm pert naturally,--taking you up about the landscape, and twitting you about the Saguenay scenery and legends, you know. But I thought {{you were trying to}} put me down,--you are rather down-putting at times,--and <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> <b>you,</b> and <b>I</b> couldn't bear it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is meant}} to be severe, Miss Bonner, and I have not {{deserved}} it from you. What has brought me to you but that <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> above all others?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How splendid!" [...] Miss Gleason exclaimed. [...] "Do {{you know}} that <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> for giving up,--for knowing when to give up? So few women do that! Is n't he magnificent?" ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. I {{have the}} {{greatest}} affection for you. <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> and of course I'm grateful to you. But if I thought I {{was in love with}} you I was mistaken.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Francis {{is a very}} judicious parent," [...] Miss Amory whispered. Don't {{you think}} so, Miss Bell? I shan't call you Miss Bell--I shall call <b>you</b> Laura. <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> <b>you</b> so at church. Your robe was not well made, nor your bonnet very fresh. But you have such {{beautiful}} grey eyes, and such a lovely tint." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have known}} you {{for so many}} years now, Peter, and I don't know of anybody whose {{character}} <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> more. <b>You</b> are so generous--quixotic in fact. You {{are one of the few}} really unselfish men I have ever met. You are always thinking of other people. Whatever it cost you, I know you would not hesitate to give up anything if you felt that it was for someone else's happiness. <b>I</b> do <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> so for it. One meets so few young men nowadays who consider anybody except themselves.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Jack. [Nervously.] Miss Fairfax, {{ever since}} I met <b>you</b> <b>I</b> have <b>admired</b> <b>you</b> {{more than any}} girl [...] . I have ever met since [...] . I met you.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{discovered}} {{an excellent way}} of punishing me," [...] he said manfully, [...] "and I submit. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> the more. So I am paying you a compliment when I whisper that I know you knew." ...|$|E
6000|$|BERTRAND. Of course, I know you're clever; <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> {{down to the}} ground, and I'll starve without you. But I can't stand it, and I'm off. Good-bye: {{good luck}} to you, old man! {{and if you want}} the bundle---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... [With a smile.] Did {{you want}} me to tell you that in so many words? <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you,</b> and I trust you. I should be very happy if George could grow into so brave and honest a man as you.|$|E
60|$|LADY. Oh! (Jumping up.) Oh, General I've not beaten <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> do <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> so. (He {{laughs and}} pats her cheek.) This time {{really and truly}} without shamming, I do you homage (kissing his hand).|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing. I ain't {{looking for}} to have {{anything}} done for me. You need to have something done for you, I guess, by the looks of you. You seem dead beat out. Aren't you awful tired? I've been listening to that woman jawing you till I felt like rising up and giving her a large and wholesome piece of my mind. I don't know how you kept your patience with her, but I can tell <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> <b>you</b> for it, and I {{made up my mind}} I'd tell you so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ask me why}} I {{sent for}} you," [...] the banker went on. [...] "It was {{primarily}} because I hoped to impress upon you the folly of marrying my daughter. And {{in spite of all}} the injury and injustice you have done me, I do not forget that you were once in a relationship to me which has been unique in my life. <b>I</b> trusted <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> <b>you,</b> for your ability, for your faculty of getting on with men. At that time you were wise enough not to attempt to pass comment upon accidents in business affairs which are, if deplorable, inevitable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see that}} you do, and <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> for it; but, Miss Dunstable, you cannot always live so," [...] and Mr Moffat {{looked at her in}} a manner which gave her the first intimation of his coming burst of tenderness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, Mr. Fitzpiers," [...] said Grace, earnestly. [...] "It {{is not so}} at all. I {{know from}} seeing your light at night how deeply you meditate and work. Instead of condemning you for your studies, <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> very much!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... --Do {{you believe}} in Jesus? I believe in man. Of course, I don't know if {{you believe in}} man. <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you,</b> sir. I admire the mind of man {{independent}} of all religions. Is that your opinion about the mind of Jesus? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But why? Perhaps {{you know}} some good reason to the contrary; for <b>I</b> heard he <b>admired</b> <b>you</b> very much when he met you last year." ...|$|R
6000|$|Granville {{held the}} dying man's hand still more gently than ever. [...] "Sir Gilbert," [...] he said, leaning over him with very tender eyes, [...] "no event on earth could ever {{possibly}} alter Gwendoline's love for me, or {{my love for}} Gwendoline. I know you can't live. This shock has been too much for you. But if {{it will make you}} die any the happier now to know that Gwendoline and I will still be one, I give you my sacred promise at this solemn moment, that as soon as she likes I will marry Gwendoline." [...] He paused for a second. [...] "I don't understand all this story just yet," [...] he went on. [...] "But of one thing I'm certain. The sympathy of every soul in court to-day went with you as you spoke out the truth so manfully. The sympathy of all England will go with you to-morrow when they come to learn of it.... Sir Gilbert, till this morning <b>I</b> never <b>admired</b> <b>you,</b> much as <b>I</b> love Gwendoline. As you made that confession just now in court, <b>I</b> declare, <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> <b>you.</b> With all the greater confidence now will I marry your daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Young man," [...] he remarked, [...] "there are {{not many}} in this country whom I can trust. You're one of them. There's a sort of {{solidity}} about <b>you</b> that <b>I</b> rather <b>admire.</b> <b>You</b> {{are not likely to}} break out and do silly things. Do you care for adventures?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's worth any woman's {{while to}} be admired as <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you.</b> Miss Tarrant, of whom we were speaking, {{affected}} me, as you say, in this way--that I think more highly still, if possible, of the sex which produced such a delightful young lady." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} have done the right thing," [...] she wrote back, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> for it." [...] But he thought she did not admire him {{sufficiently}} for it, {{and he did not}} answer her letter, so it was the last that passed between them.|$|E
6000|$|Josie's blush {{and smile}} betrayed {{her before she}} said, with a look full of girlish adoration and humility: 'I couldn't help it; <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> so much. I {{know it was a}} liberty; but as I couldn't get in myself, I loved to think my posies pleased you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{seen you}} {{repeatedly}} upon the stage," [...] he told her, [...] "and, though musical comedy is rather {{out of my}} line, <b>I</b> have always <b>admired</b> <b>you</b> immensely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear lady!" [...] I cried, {{drawing a}} deep breath, [...] "I implore {{you in this}} strait, listen to what I urge. Why fight your battle alone? Why refuse assistance? <b>I</b> have <b>admired</b> <b>you</b> so long--I am so eager to help you. If only you will allow me to call you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not very well," [...] he returned, growing very serious. [...] "You {{know that}} as well as I do. You must know, dear Miss Starbrow, that <b>I</b> have <b>admired</b> <b>you</b> for a long time. Perhaps you also know that I love you. Miss Starbrow, will you be my wife and make me happy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{appreciate}} that in you!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I wished {{you to know}} it. I wished you to know," [...] she added, a little unsteadily, [...] "how much <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> for what you are doing. They are afraid of you--they will crush you if they can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I {{am quite}} surprised,’ {{he said at}} last. ‘People tell you the French are insincere. Now, I think your sincerity is beautiful. I {{think you have a}} noble character. <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> very much. I am very {{grateful}} for your kindness to—to one so young,’ and he offered me his hand.|$|E
60|$|I esteem you, I {{love you}} as a friend; <b>I</b> <b>admire</b> <b>you,</b> I love {{you as a}} woman, beyond any one in all the circle of creation; I know I shall {{continue}} to esteem you, to love you, to pray for you, nay, to pray for myself for your sake.|$|E
6000|$|... "Although {{the flowers}} <b>I</b> much <b>admire,</b> [...] <b>You</b> know papa did say [...] He won't be home again, Squire, [...] Till all have passed away." ...|$|R
5000|$|Former World Heavyweight Champion Tommy Burns was referee in {{the third}} fight. At the end, he caught Langford's hand and said to him, [...] "Sam, this is the hardest I ever had to do in my life. <b>I</b> always <b>admired</b> <b>you</b> and never thought to see you beaten, but I {{have to give the}} {{decision}} against you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{seen the}} house! Well;--there's {{something}} in that. The house is all there, I can tell you. I'm {{not a bit}} afraid but what you'll like the house. But if we were engaged, I could do everything for you. Where would you be, going into San Francisco all alone? Oh, Miss Melmotte, <b>I</b> do <b>admire</b> <b>you</b> so much!' ...|$|R
