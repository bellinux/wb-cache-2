5|$|By January 2017, Long War Studios {{announced}} they {{have changed their}} name to Pavonis Interactive, and among other projects, are working with Firaxis to bring a new mod, Long War 2, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as the original Long War, to XCOM 2. The Long War 2 mod was released on January 19, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Narihira {{was not a}} {{profound}} poet. His surviving poems are mainly occasional, and even when the expression suggests deeply felt emotion, its worldly manner keeps his poetry from attaining {{the grandeur of the}} best Man'yōshū poems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein.</b> He is nevertheless of historical importance as one who maintained the traditions of the waka during the long night of the dominance of poetry in Chinese.|$|E
5|$|The {{mobile phone}} {{version of the}} game is {{primarily}} a beat 'em up with role-playing elements. Unlike the console versions the game plays as a side-scroller <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as the 1992 X-Men arcade game. There are five selectable characters, and players upgrade each through experience points earned. Players control one character at a time, and can switch to another at the press of a button.|$|E
2500|$|On May 1, 2006, RIM was sued by Visto for {{infringement}} of four patents. [...] Though the patents {{were widely}} considered invalid and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>veins</b> as <b>the</b> NTP patents – with a judgement going against Visto <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.K. – RIM settled <b>the</b> lawsuit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States on July 16, 2009, with RIM agreeing to pay Visto US$267.5 million plus other undisclosed terms.|$|R

5|$|In early 2009, McCann {{received}} a brief {{to create a}} new campaign for the latest entrant into the Halo series, a first-person shooter called Halo 3: ODST. It would be the first game in the franchise not to feature the series' protagonist, the Master Chief. McCann returned with a pitch for a campaign <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as Believe, aiming to humanize the soldiers featured in the Halo universe. The project was greenlit, and McCann brought back several collaborators from Believe to handle this new campaign, now given the working title of The Life.|$|E
5|$|Stereotypical and {{historically}} inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views {{of indigenous peoples}} and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they {{contribute to the development}} of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein,</b> we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Jareth also underwent some significant developments {{during the early}} stages of pre-production. According to Henson he was originally meant to be another puppet creature <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as his goblin subjects. Henson eventually decided he wanted a big, charismatic star to play the Goblin King, and decided to pursue a musician for the role. Sting, Prince, Mick Jagger, and Michael Jackson were considered for the part; however, it was ultimately decided that David Bowie would be the most suitable choice.|$|E
50|$|His playing career {{continued}} <b>in</b> much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> through senior tournaments. He was {{a multiple}} Welsh Doubles Championship finalist, a Wales international player and captained his county side.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as Far Cry {{and other}} {{games of the}} genre, Red Ocean could be {{considered}} a traditional FPS. The game tries to introduce some innovative elements like water effects including rooms that flood and underwater diving sequences.|$|R
50|$|Several former ToyFare staffers, such as Doug Goldstein, Tom Root, and Matthew Senreich, {{went on to}} {{help create}} the Adult Swim program Robot Chicken with actor Seth Green. <b>The</b> show is <b>in</b> much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> of humor as Twisted ToyFare Theatre.|$|R
5|$|The {{criticism}} {{against the}} artistic freedom of giving a personal {{interpretation of a}} distant historic event, could have been directed at many other historic paintings of the 19th century. The criticism against Midvinterblot would be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> during the following years. Larsson retorted that he would happily delegate the task to a younger talent—but he made a second version in oil (№ 237) in which he made the temple wider and where he added an executioner in the centre. The sets of characters were more closely assembled and the frieze-like quality was enhanced.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{theory to}} Syme's {{has been put}} forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was {{probably}} a satirical poet, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always {{in the context of}} Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.|$|E
5|$|Aratus sent an embassy to Antigonus III in 226BC {{seeking an}} {{unexpected}} alliance {{now that the}} reformist king Cleomenes III of Sparta was threatening the rest of Greece in the Cleomenean War (229–222BC). In exchange for military aid, AntigonusIII demanded the return of Corinth to Macedonian control, which Aratus finally agreed to in 225BC. In 224BC, AntigonusIII's forces took Arcadia from Sparta. After forming a Hellenic league <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as PhilipII's League of Corinth, he managed to defeat Sparta at the Battle of Sellasia in 222BC. Sparta was occupied by a foreign power {{for the first time}} in its history, restoring Macedonia's position as the leading power in Greece. Antigonus died a year later, perhaps from tuberculosis, leaving behind a strong Hellenistic kingdom for his successor PhilipV.|$|E
50|$|There is also {{evidence}} of an Anacreontic Society having existed at St Andrews University <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 18th Century <b>in</b> much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as <b>the</b> Anacreontic Society of London. However, due to the club's informal nature, detailed accounts of the group are sparse.|$|R
5000|$|The comedy crosses a {{broad range}} of genres common to Japanese film, in a similar fashion to Kitano's 1995 parody Getting Any?

5000|$|As one {{journalist}} wrote, [...] "some {{have chosen}} a short, but sweet, route, while others have been incredibly elaborate in their surprise." [...] David D. of the blog Uproxx considered {{it to be the}} highest degree of rickrolling given how [...] "incredibly obnoxious" [...] the theme song is when it is played out of nowhere during a clip, but also called it a knock-off of <b>the</b> parts <b>in</b> WWE Slam City where John Cena and his theme song are also sometimes presented at an unexpected moment. The meme has also been labeled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>veins</b> as those of Dragon Ball Z, Shrek and Randy Orton's [...] "RKO from outta nowhere" [...] Vines.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{supporting}} {{tour for}} Love Letter, Kelly underwent emergency throat surgery in July 2011 to drain an abscess on one of his tonsils. He recovered, and in August, announced that his next album will be called Black Panties, a sexually charged album <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> of his 1993 debut album, 12 Play. However, he deviated from that plan in January 2012 by announcing Write Me Back as his next album. He recorded the album at Sylvester Stone Studios and The Chocolate Factory in Chicago, and at MilkBoy The Studio in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Events {{under the}} Ski Flying World Cup have several {{differences}} to the Ski Flying World Championships. The latter is an isolated tournament, or one-off event, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as the Ski Jumping World Championships and Winter Olympics, whereas the Ski Flying World Cup {{is part of}} the overall Ski Jumping World Cup season, and uses the same points system. These points contribute towards both Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup standings; the former being effectively a 'mini season' within the latter. However, a feature shared with the Ski Flying World Championships is that the starting order switches over from the Ski Jumping World Cup standings to the Ski Flying World Cup standings after the first competition of the latter, and remains that way for all subsequent events.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} part of a {{movement}} by Gregory to turn away from the East, and look to the Western parts of the old Roman Empire. After Gregory, a number of his successors as pope continued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein,</b> and maintained papal support for the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. The missionary efforts of Augustine and his companions, along with those of the Hiberno-Scottish missionaries, were the model for the later Anglo-Saxon missionaries to Germany. The historian R. A. Markus suggests that the Gregorian mission was a turning point in papal missionary strategy, marking the beginnings of a policy of persuasion rather than coercion.|$|E
50|$|Till fjälls ("To the Mountains") is {{the first}} {{full-length}} album by Swedish folk metal band Vintersorg. Stylistically this continued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> musical <b>vein</b> as <b>the</b> previous album, Hedniskhjärtad, with black metal-style riffs, harsh vocals and blast beats interspersed with folk melodies, acoustics, and atmospherics.|$|R
50|$|With {{the supreme}} {{dominance}} by Railway Union of <b>the</b> league <b>in</b> <b>the</b> twenties, {{it was a}} very fine achievement of Monkstown to win four 'Mills' cups during the decade. <b>The</b> thirties continued <b>in</b> much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> with two 'Mills' wins with, however, a slump to Senior 'B' by 1938.|$|R
50|$|In early 2006, Hem's third album, No Word From Tom, was {{released}} by Nettwerk. <b>In</b> much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as <b>the</b> band's EP I'm Talking With My Mouth, No Word From Tom showcased a collection of cover songs, live versions of original songs from prior albums, and some new material.|$|R
5|$|Although the Achaean League {{had been}} {{fighting}} Macedonia for decades, Aratus sent an embassy to Antigonus III in 226 BC seeking an unexpected alliance now that the reformist king Cleomenes III of Sparta was threatening the rest of Greece in the Cleomenean War (229–222 BC). In exchange for military aid, Antigonus III demanded the return of Corinth to Macedonian control, which Aratus finally agreed to in 225 BC. Antigonus III's first move against Sparta was to capture Arcadia {{in the spring of}} 224 BC. After reforming a Hellenic league <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as Philip II's League of Corinth and hiring Illyrian mercenaries for additional support, Antigonus III managed to defeat Sparta at the Battle of Sellasia in 222 BC. For the first time in Sparta's history, their city was then occupied by a foreign power, restoring Macedonia's position as the leading power in Greece. Antigonus died a year later, perhaps from tuberculosis, leaving behind a strong Hellenistic kingdom for his successor Philip V.|$|E
5|$|Ibira {{initially}} pictured Karas as {{a horror}} {{story with a}} vengeance theme. It had a simple plot similar to the manga, Dororo. The protagonist karas is on a quest, slaughtering mikuras to recover the body parts of his murdered lover. Until he recovers all the parts, he assembles them into a katana to kill the mikuras. The final version of Karas {{was more of a}} superhero action story, and originally intended for three leading heroes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as the Japanese period drama, Sanbiki ga Kiru!. The characters Otoha, Nue, and the human detective Kure were the leads but the final version primarily focused on Otoha. The presentation of Karas differs in several ways from typical anime. The show maintains a serious tone and never indulges in slapstick, exaggerated facial expressions, or super deformed characters. It avoids heavy expositions. Dialogue tends to be short and viewers have to infer what is going on based on very little presented information. The team had left out substantial amounts of information from the show, printing them in a booklet of the final DVD package.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, RedOctane, {{a company}} {{specializing in the}} {{manufacture}} of unique game controllers, was inspired to create Guitar Hero based on RedOctane's experience creating hardware for Konami's Guitar Freaks arcade game. They enlisted Harmonix, who previously developed several music video games, for development assistance. The first game in the series was made on a budget of $1 million. The series became extremely successful, leading to the acquisition of RedOctane by Activision in 2007. Harmonix was acquired by MTV Games and went on to create the Rock Band series of music games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as Guitar Hero. Activision brought Neversoft (primarily known for their Tony Hawk series of skateboarding games) on board for future development duties. Additional companies, such as Budcat Creations and Vicarious Visions have assisted in the adaptation of the games for other systems.|$|E
50|$|Heavens Above! is a 1963 British satirical comedy film {{starring}} Peter Sellers, {{directed by}} John and Roy Boulting, who also co-wrote along with Frank Harvey, from an idea by Malcolm Muggeridge. It is <b>in</b> much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as <b>the</b> earlier collaboration between Sellers, Harvey and the Boultings, I'm All Right Jack.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} awarded 4 stars in an Allmusic review by Jason Ankeny who states [...] "Musty Rusty follows <b>in</b> much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as Lou Donaldson's {{previous}} LPs for Blue Note... Donaldson originals like [...] "Hippity Hop" [...] {{and the title}} tune crackle with energy, and the melodic ingenuity of Green's guitar solos astounds".|$|R
5|$|He was {{replaced}} by Christopher Joseph Ward (C.J. Ramone), who performed with the band until they disbanded. Dee Dee initially pursued a brief career as a rapper under the name Dee Dee King.

5|$|The {{music of}} SaGa 1 was {{composed}} by Nobuo Uematsu, {{and that of}} SaGa 2 by Uematsu and Kenji Ito, while the music of SaGa 3 was composed by Ryuji Sasai and Chihiro Fujioka. Uematsu has stated that while SaGa 1s music could be made of better quality, the emphasis was on enjoying the game, and not solely its appearance or sound. The Game Boy's sound hardware was {{different from that of}} the Famicom, which Uematsu was used to composing for at the time, with new stereo and waveforms and only three notes; as a result, Uematsu struggled with deciding how to work with these, developing new themes for the music in the process despite SaGa 1s director Akitoshi Kawazu's desire to have the music be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as Square's preceding Final Fantasy titles. Uematsu has stated that the Game Boy was a system he would like to compose for again. SaGa 2 was the first soundtrack or album that Kenji Ito worked on.|$|E
5|$|While {{living in}} Vidal, Wyatt and Josie were visited by Billy Breakenridge, the former Tombstone deputy under John Behan. He pressed Wyatt for details about {{his time in}} Tombstone to add to his book Helldorado: Bringing Law to the Mesquite. Breakenridge was {{assisted}} by Western novelist William MacLeod Raine, who since 1904 had published more than 25 novels about Western history. The book was published in 1928 before Wyatt died. It depicted Wyatt as a thief, pimp, crooked gambler, and murderer. Breakenridge wrote that the Earps and Doc Holliday aggressively mistreated the guiltless cowboys until they were forced into a fatal confrontation. His description of the 1881 O.K. Corral gun fight stated that the Clanton and McLaury brothers were merely cowboys who had been unarmed and surrendered but the Earp brothers had shot them in cold blood. Wyatt and Josie protested that the book's contents was biased and more fiction than fact. Earp complained about the book {{until his death in}} 1929, and his wife continued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> afterward.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Hassinger still {{owned the}} rights to The Electric Prunes's name, and was {{encouraged}} {{by the success of}} Mass in F Minor, which prompted him to assemble a new line-up. He was steered toward the Colorado group, Climax, by Rich Fifield. Fifield had worked in fellow Colorado band, Hardwater (previously the surf rock band The Astronauts), which was managed by Poncher, and produced an album with Axelrod. The new Electric Prunes line-up included Climax members Richard Whetstone (vocals, guitar), John Herron (organ), and Mark Kincaid (guitar) with Brett Wade (bass guitar), who was recommended by The Collectors. With the group restructured, Axelrod, again, composed all the material for their next album, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as the previous effort, and centered it around the Jewish prayer, Kol Nidre. The album, titled Release of an Oath, utilized several session musicians including Howard Roberts, Carol Kaye, and Earl Palmer, and saw Whetstone as the only band member to contribute to the recordings. Although the album was considered more cohesive and progressive than its predecessor, it failed to chart upon its release in November 1968. Afterwards, Axelrod returned to his past position at Capitol Records, and The Electric Prunes toured as a supporting act for bands such as Steppenwolf, Canned Heat, and New Buffalo Springfield.|$|E
5000|$|Budakhan Mindphone is a 1999 album by Squarepusher, {{released}} on Warp Records. It follows <b>in</b> much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as its predecessor, Music Is Rotted One Note, {{and is often}} classified as an EP due to its relative brevity—the cover refers to it as [...] "a mini-album". It reached number 183 on the UK Albums Chart.|$|R

25|$|Blast of Silence (Axed My Baby for a Nickel) was {{released}} the following year, continuing <b>in</b> much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as Visions of Excess and with appearances {{by many of}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> personnel. It included covers of two songs written by Little Feat's Lowell George, both sung by Syd Straw. The record also featured prominent guest appearances by Matthew Sweet, Don Dixon, Peter Holsapple and T-Bone Burnett.|$|R
