5|$|A {{plea for}} a review by the Constitutional Tribunal was sought as a last-ditch attempt {{to stave off the}} {{execution}} of drug trafficker Shanmugam Murugesu. Shanmugam's lawyer contended that his client's right to equal protection under Article 12 of the Constitution had been infringed. Referring to cases of six recent offenders similarly convicted under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Shanmugam's lawyer drew {{attention to the fact that}} those offenders had imported more than 700grammes of cannabis, an offence which attracted the death penalty, but were eventually charged with possessing less than 500grammes of cannabis which resulted only in a jail sentence. In contrast, Shanmugam, who had imported 1,029.8grammes of cannabis, did not have the amount reduced and was sentenced to death. The plea was rejected by the President on 12 May 2005, one day before the <b>execution</b> <b>date.</b>|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{filed an}} appeal disputing the {{constitutionality}} of his first-degree murder conviction with the Utah Supreme Court. His attorney argued that Parsons had already been convicted of another charge for the crime, making his murder conviction a violation of double jeopardy. On October 16, 1989, the court unanimously upheld the conviction and rejected his appeal {{on the grounds that}} Parsons should have raised that objection before he waived his right to a trial with his guilty plea. On March 5, 1990, District Judge J. Philip Eves rejected Parsons' complaint that he was denied his right to legal counsel while in prison and set his <b>execution</b> <b>date</b> for April 30, 1990. A new team of attorneys, which included Gregory Sanders and Ronald Yengich of the Rocky Mountain Defense Fund, took up Parsons' appeal that he had ineffective counsel during his trial. On January 12, 1994, the Utah Supreme Court rejected Parsons' petition for a writ of habeas corpus.|$|E

40|$|Static {{scheduling}} {{consists in}} compile-time mapping of operations onto logical <b>execution</b> <b>dates.</b> However, scheduling {{so far only}} applies to static control programs, i. e. roughly to nests of do (or for) loops. To extend scheduling to dynamic control programs, one needs a method that 1) is consistent with unpredictable control ows (and thus unpredictable iteration domains) 2) is consistent with unpredictable data ows, and 3) permits speculative execution.

These paintings depicting brutal events during the German occupation of Poland are exceptional for the intensity of feeling they provoke.

25|$|The {{defendants}} petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, {{alleging that}} the proceedings {{that took place in}} the Arkansas state court, while ostensibly complying with trial requirements, satisfied these only in form. They argued that the accused were convicted under pressure of the armed mob, with blatant disregard for their constitutional rights, and that pre-trial publicity had prejudiced the proceedings. The defense team had originally intended to file this petition in federal court, but the only sitting judge was assigned to other judicial duties in Minnesota at the time and would not return to Arkansas until after the defendants' scheduled <b>execution</b> <b>date.</b> The state chancery court issued the writ.

50|$|King is also {{a staunch}} proponent {{of the death penalty}}. When many states voluntarily {{suspended}} executions during U.S. Supreme Court litigation over lethal injection, King continued to seek setting <b>execution</b> <b>dates</b> in Alabama. King's support of the death penalty created a controversy when, in 2007, a district attorney in suburban Birmingham supported commuting the death sentence of an accomplice in a case in which the actual shooter had escaped the death penalty because he was a juvenile. King received support in the controversy from the victim's family, and from death penalty supporters, for his efforts to seek the death penalty for the accomplice. The incident led a wide, bipartisan coalition of local district attorneys, as well as newspaper editorials, to criticize King.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we study}} the {{following}} theoretical scheduling problem: {{the tasks of}} a given application have to be statically distributed and executed on the heterogeneous servers of a multi-user system on a wide area, heterogeneous network, such as Internet. The application is divided into a set of communicating tasks that may be executed on at least one, and possibly several, servers. The processing time of each task depends on the server processing it, and the communication delay between two tasks depends on the communicating servers. Task duplication is allowed. We propose an efficient algorithm that first uses a PERT-like algorithm to compute the earliest <b>execution</b> <b>dates</b> of each task and then build an optimal static solution for this scheduling problem, with a low number of tasks duplications...|$|R
