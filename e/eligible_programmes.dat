40|$|Purpose – The {{extent to}} which {{research}} into the design and development of environmental health indicators (EHIs) has translated into operational programmes is unclear. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify EHI initiatives worldwide, distil the EHIs and draw lessons from the experience. Design/methodology/approach – A systematic internet-based review was undertaken. Programmes were selected for inclusion if they: first, had the ability to monitor both the physical environment and associated health outcomes; and second, the parent agency had the ability to influence policies related to the environment and health. Findings – The small number of <b>eligible</b> <b>programmes</b> indicates EHI initiatives are not yet well established, especially in developing countries. The use of indicators was also limited by uncertainties in the exposure-response relationships that they implied, and the consequent inability to translate the indicators into a common measure of health impact. In addition, there is no information on the {{extent to which}} the indicators have been applied in decision making, nor on the policy implications of using indicators. Practical implications – More effort is needed to encourage the development and use of more balanced and informative sets of indicators, and to evaluate their use and outcomes in terms of health benefits. Originality/value – The time is right for a substantial review paper on EHIs as they are now being used by a number of organisations and to the knowledge this is the first review of operational EHI programmes worldwide...|$|E

40|$|In a sharp regression-discontinuity design (RDD) the {{participation}} status deterministically {{depends on whether}} a preprogramme characteristic is above or below a specified threshold. The attractiveness of such a design rests on close similarities with a formal experiment. Nevertheless, it is of limited applicability since participation into a programme is seldom determined according to this rule. Besides, {{in the presence of}} heterogeneous effects a sharp RDD only allows identification of mean effects for individuals around the threshold for participation. Two results are presented in this paper, and they both partially overcome the two limitations described above. We show that when individuals self-select into participation conditional on some eligibility criteria a sharp RDD provides a natural framework to define a specification test for the non-experimental estimation of programme effects for participants away from the threshold. We also show that, in this set-up, the regularity conditions required for the identification of the mean counterfactual outcome for participants marginally <b>eligible</b> for the <b>programme</b> are essentially the same as in a sharp RDD...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimated}} {{road safety}} effect of an alcolock programme and its cost-benefit ratio. It {{is estimated that}} {{a quarter of the}} fatal road crashes in the Netherlands is caused by the use of alcohol. Three-quarters of these crashes are caused by offenders with a blood alcohol content (BAC) exceeding 1. 3 g/l. Despite increased police enforcement of drink-driving, this situation has hardly changed since the year 2000. The number of road deaths that are caused by heavy offenders has in recent years been around 150 per annum. To achieve a more effective approach towards heavy drinkers in traffic the Dutch government has decided to introduce an alcolock programme in 2010. With this approach the Netherlands follow the United States, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Finland and France. Serious offenders will be forced to have an alcolock installed in their car. If they fail to do so, their driving license will be revoked. An alcolock is a breath tester which functions as an ignition interlock. Not until the driver's breath has registered free of alcohol, he or she can start the vehicle motor. Compulsory participation in the programme will be for a minimum of two years. arious international evaluation studies have indicated that recidivism is on average 75 % less among drivers with an alcolock than among offenders whose license has been suspended. If all heavy offenders were <b>eligible</b> for the <b>programme,</b> there would approximately be 13, 500 per year. And if they could participate in the programme immediately, an estimated two thirds would indeed take part. But in fact the most serious offenders are not <b>eligible</b> for the <b>programme.</b> They are the novice drivers with a BAC of 1. 8 g/l or higher, 'experienced' drivers with a BAC of 2. 1 g/l or higher, and suspects who refuse to cooperate with the breath analysis. Moreover, the largest part of the remaining group is first has to face a suspension or a withdrawal. An annual number of approximately 2, 200 offenders are expected to start the programme. If another 10 % of the participants drop out during the programme, there will a permanent number of approximately 4, 000 drivers who take part in the programme. The programme would then save three to five road deaths on an annual basis. This number of lives saved can go up to eight to ten per year if drivers are not allowed to leave the programme until they have shown to be capable of separating the use of alcohol and traffic participation. In that case there might eventually be a permanent number of 6, 000 participants in the programme. The annual benefits of the programme could then amount to € 110 million (€ 11 million per life saved), while the costs are less than € 10 million. Moreover, the costs are paid by the participants themselves. When judicial and administrative legal measures are tuned to the programme, in the somewhat more distant future an annual saving of 30 to 35 road deaths seems possible...|$|R
40|$|The current {{government}} has substantially increased {{the use of}} means-tested tax and benefit programmes {{to try to help}} people on low incomes. An important early example of this was the replacement in October 1999 of Family Credit (FC), a benefit providing support for low-income working parents, by Working Families' Tax Credit (WFTC). WFTC was delivered differently from FC, it was described as a tax credit rather than a benefit, and it was also much more generous than its predecessor. However, the efficacy of using means-testing to help people on low incomes is limited by {{the fact that many of}} the people <b>eligible</b> for means-tested <b>programmes</b> do not take them up. Because of this, one of the government's stated aims when introducing WFTC was to encourage take-up, arguing that as a tax credit rather than a welfare benefit, it will reduce the stigma associated with claiming in-work support, and encourage higher take-up. In this paper we try to answer the question of whether the replacement of FC by WFTC did indeed encourage take-up. We also try and identify more generally what factors are important in explaining non-take-up of FC and WFTC, in particular quantifying the effect of entitlement level and examining the effects of people's knowledge of, and attitudes towards, in-work support. Our approach is an econometric one, investigating the relationship between take-up of FC/WFTC and a variety of explanatory variables in two micro-data-sets, the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and the Families and Children Survey (FACS). ...|$|R

Design: The project {{was part of a}} larger, 2 -year cross-sectional study. Setting: Full-day kindergarten classrooms across London, Ontario, Canada. Methods: Participants included 113 young children (mean age[*]=[*] 4. 69 [*]years; standard deviation [SD][*]=[*] 0. 66 [*]years) from <b>eligible</b> full-day kindergarten <b>programmes.</b> Participants’ {{physical activity}} and sedentary data were collected using Actical accelerometers worn for five consecutive days during school hours only.

Results: Participants mean activity rates (i. e. sedentary time, light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA] and total physical activity [TPA]) during school hours were similar across both formats. Participants’ overall daily {{physical activity and}} sedentary time did not significantly differ across school schedule type (p[*] 3 ̆e[*]. 05); however, participants adhering to the traditional schedule accumulated significantly more TPA outdoors than those following the balanced day schedule. Conclusion: Neither schedule format appeared to be superior with regard to supporting overall daily physical activity nor minimising sedentary time in school, although children adhering to the traditional schedule format did accumulate more physical activity during periods of outdoor play. Regardless of schedule type, steps are warranted to encourage additional movement (and minimise sedentary behaviours) in the school setting by school and public health officials...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To examine parents’ {{experiences}} of receiving feedback {{from a child}} weight screening programme in the UK Background: Launched in England in 2005, the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) is a mandatory school-based height and weight surveillance programme. Routine feedback on children’s height and weight is provided to all parents. Previous research highlights parental concerns over weight-related feedback and the effects it has on them and their child, particularly if their child is overweight. Methodology: A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted to identify relevant quantitative, qualitative or mixed-methods studies related to parental feedback on child weight and screening programmes. Study design features, context, methodology and outcomes were extracted. Due {{to the nature of}} the included papers a meta-analysis was not appropriate; all studies were narratively analysed. Results: Seven studies were eligible for inclusion, which included three mixed-methods, two qualitative, and two cohort studies, representing the {{experiences of}} 3, 182 parents. One of the included studies was of good quality and the remaining six were of moderate quality. Five themes were generated from the data: parental perceptions of weight and health; healthy lifestyles and behaviour change; feedback method and structure; impact on the child; and, measures and credibility. Parents’ experiences of weight-related feedback was mixed, with some reporting positive outcomes, to others reporting upset and distress. In some cases parents’ experiences were associated with the weight category reported. Conclusions: This review identified the potential benefits of providing parents with feedback focused on lifestyle changes as opposed to weight. Piloting such forms of feedback may provide useful insights for future programme delivery. Parents’ preferences for feedback may be further understood by conducting public involvement research, establishing how parents of children <b>eligible</b> for such <b>programmes</b> would like to receive the feedback...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Preventative {{medicine}} {{has become increasingly}} important in efforts to reduce the burden of chronic disease in industrialised countries. However, interventions that fail to recruit socio-economically representative samples may widen existing health inequalities. This paper explores the barriers and facilitators to engaging a socio-economically disadvantaged (SED) population in primary prevention for coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods The primary prevention element of Have a Heart Paisley (HaHP) offered risk screening to all <b>eligible</b> individuals. The <b>programme</b> employed two approaches to engaging with the community: a) a social marketing campaign and b) a community development project adopting primarily face-to-face canvassing. Individuals living in areas of SED were under-recruited via the social marketing approach, but successfully recruited via face-to-face canvassing. This paper reports on focus group discussions with participants, exploring their perceptions about and experiences of both approaches. Results Various reasons were identified for low uptake of risk screening amongst individuals living in areas of high SED {{in response to the}} social marketing campaign and a number of ways in which the face-to-face canvassing approach overcame these barriers were identified. These have been categorised into four main themes: (1) processes of engagement; (2) issues of understanding; (3) design of the screening service and (4) the priority accorded to screening. The most immediate barriers to recruitment were the invitation letter, which often failed to reach its target, and the general distrust of postal correspondence. In contrast, participants were positive about the face-to-face canvassing approach. Participants expressed a lack of knowledge and understanding about CHD and their risk of developing it and felt {{there was a lack of}} clarity in the information provided in the mailing in terms of the process and value of screening. In contrast, direct face-to-face contact meant that outreach workers could explain what to expect. Participants felt that the procedure for uptake of screening was demanding and inflexible, but that the drop-in sessions employed by the community development project had a major impact on recruitment and retention. Conclusion Socio-economically disadvantaged individuals can be hard-to-reach; engagement requires strategies tailored to the needs of the target population rather than a population-wide approach. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study utilises a biographical {{approach}} {{in order to}} understand the reported individual health and wellbeing outcomes of the Personal Best Volunteering Training Programme for a group of six people. Only candidates, who were not in education or training or were economically inactive, were <b>eligible</b> for the <b>programme.</b> All students on the Personal Best Volunteering Training Programme have experienced social exclusion either through drug and or alcohol addiction or mental illness. Their spoken biographies were collected in the spring of 2012; some six to twelve months after the participants had completed the course. The participant biographies set the research within a social and chronological context. Work by Marmot (2006) maintains that health outcomes are unequally distributed throughout the population and are influenced by personal autonomy and social participation, while the most vulnerable groups in society are recognised as the hardest to reach in terms of health promotion. This research links the factors which influence health with the recognised benefits of volunteering; which includes enhanced interpersonal skills, increased social networks and the development of personal characteristics (Musick and Wilson 2005). Volunteering research to date has centred on people who already possess extensive personal, social and economic resources. This research demonstrates that socially excluded individuals experience similar benefits. The findings indicate that the participants reported wide-ranging health and wellbeing benefits, enhanced communication and team working skills, the development of employability skills, improved and extended social networks. However the most significant and pervasive benefit of volunteering for this group of individuals was the development of positive self-concept and enhanced self-esteem. A key recommendation of this study is that socially excluded people should not merely be the recipients of volunteer services but have the opportunity to be prepared and actively involved in the delivery of such services. This work suggests that the PBVTP was a success largely because it was specifically designed to meet the needs of people not in education, training or employment and it recommends that volunteering courses should continue to be offered to socially excluded individuals, however to ensure further success, this study endorses the development and provision of a bespoke course explicitly design for these individuals. <br/...|$|R

In this report, we will not describe in detail the programme or the methodology of the proposed evaluation, as this was done in IFS-Econometria-SEI (2003 a). The main aim of the document is to discuss the first, baseline survey that was collected for this evaluation. While the baseline survey cannot, by definition, be used to perform impact evaluation, {{towards the end of the}} report we exploit the slightly peculiar way in which the programme was started and have a first very preliminary glance at some of the impacts that the programme might have. The methodological caveats on interpreting these results should be taken very seriously. This report does not contain an extensive ‘fieldwork’ report. This is included in SEI (2003). Analogously, we do not discuss extensively the operation of the programme and the evidence that emerged on related issues and on targeting. These issues are covered in IFS-Econometria- SEI (2003 b, 2003 c). We will be referring to some of the issues raised in those reports, however. This report is divided into five chapters. In Chapter 1, we briefly summarise the main features of the programme and its proposed evaluation. A more detailed description of both of these aspects is contained in IFS-Econometria-SEI (2003 a). Here, however, we give some details on the expansion of the programme and on the features of this expansion that allow a first and preliminary analysis of the impact of the programme. In Chapter 2, we describe the statistical methodology that will be used in the report. This includes the methodology for the data description that constitutes the largest part of the report and for the preliminary impact evaluation. Chapter 3 {{describes the}} baseline survey. This chapter is divided into several sections, each referring to a particular module. In each section, we first describe the ‘treatment’ population – that is, the households <b>eligible</b> for the <b>programme</b> that were living in villages targeted by the programme. We then move on to the population living in ‘control’ villages – that is, in villages that were not targeted by the programme and yet are, nonetheless, reasonably similar to the treatment villages.

40|$| {{still had}} medical problems. One third stated they had {{psychological}} problems, {{almost the same}} percentage as before their detention. Almost eighty per cent received social benefits after their detention. Particularly the respondents who had served their sentences in a closed prison appeared to be highly dependent on social benefits afterwards. Around one third stated that they supplemented the benefit with income earned through illegal jobs and criminal activities. More than seventy per cent had debts. After their discharge, several drug addicts who had had {{a place to live}} before detention appeared to have become homeless. On the other hand, the number of respondents in the relatively favourable categories four and five rose slightly, while some respondents were no longer addicted after detention. Still, the group that ultimately remained addicted and lost their income from work was the larger one. Although some favourable changes can be discerned, therefore, most of the changes {{in the lives of the}} respondents appear to be negative. Changes after discharge mainly drove respondents in the direction of the first, least favourable category and to a lesser extent in the direction of the more successful categories four and five. This increased the gap between the respondent groups. Chapter 7 describes how the respondents fared after detention in relation to the law. Two years after discharge, thirty per cent of the respondents had not been convicted again. More than half of the respondents from semi-open prisons had not been convicted again, while approximately one fifth of the respondents from closed prisons had not been convicted again. After discharge, the respondents from closed prisons were convicted significantly more often to prison sentences than the semi-open prison group. Around forty per cent of the respondents were not convicted to any prison sentence after discharge. A relatively large number of this group had served their sentences in semi-open prisons. Around twenty per cent were convicted to community service. Ten per cent of the respondents — all from closed prisons — still had cases pending against them before the subdistrict court. More than forty percent still had cases pending against them before the district court. Around half had no cases pending against them, either before the subdistrict or the district court. This group had a relatively high number of respondents from semi-open prisons. There were persistent offenders in all categories. Repetition of offences was higher in categories in which addictions played an important role. In the first three categories, a relatively large number of respondents had been convicted again to a prison sentence since their discharge. The first category had the highest percentage of repeat offenders (86 %). The respondents from the first three categories were also to a relatively high degree involved in cases that were still sub judice. Chapter 8 discusses developments that occurred after the field work stage of the research. In this period (1995 - 1999), the number of unconditional short-term sentences decreased — both in absolute numbers and in relation to long-term sentences. Nevertheless, the short sentence still made up more then seventy per cent of the total number of prison sentences pronounced in 1997. Although the numbers of short sentences and community sentences are nearing each other, this is a very gradual process. For the time being, the number of short sentences greatly exceeds the number of community sentences. On 1 January 1999, the Penitentiaire Beginselenwet Gevangeniswezen (PBW: Penitentiary System Act) came into force. This act replaces the Beginselenwet Gevangeniswezen (Prison Act) of 1953. The PBW is formulated in accordance with the principles formulated in the Werkzame Dententie (Detention that Works) memorandum. A remarkable principle of the PBW is that it no longer distinguishes between short-term prisoners and those that serve long sentences. In the old act, this distinction was one of the starting-points of the differentiation system. The new act no longer adheres to this criterion. A distinction is still made, however, on the basis of the number of days of the sentence that are still to be served. Werkzame Detentie (1994) introduced the standard regime, which made detention considerably harder for the majority of prisoners. An even more sober regime was introduced on 1 November 1996. This so-called ‘austere regime’ is a variant of the limited community regime. It offers the minimum statutory activities in a day programme of no more than eight hours. There is no evening programme. The maximum number of days under the austere regime has been set to sixty days. This regime is intended for the following groups of detainees: those that have been arrested so that they may serve an unconditional prison sentence, those serving alternative sentences, and suspects from the so-called nuisance category who have been given a short sentence as part of accelerated criminal proceedings. One of the principal instruments for realising the reintegration of prisoners into society has undoubtedly been the introduction of the ‘penitentiary programme’. Only prisoners that have been convicted to a prison sentence of which the unconditional period is at least one year are <b>eligible</b> for this <b>programme</b> (art. 4, section 2 sub a PBW); short-term prisoners are excluded from it. On 27 July 1998, a legislative proposal was submitted to give community service an independent status beside the prison sentence and the fine (TK 1997 - 1998, 26 114, nos. 1 - 2). As far as severity is concerned, community service should take up a middle position between the two other main forms of punishment. The proposal also provides a legal basis for compulsory training sentences for adults and relaxes the regulations for community sentence offers and subsequent assent. The maximum number of hours of community service remains 240, while the maximum for a combination community/compulsory training sentence is 480 hours. The proposal also allows mixing community service with fines and prison sentences and enables the court to impose an alternative community sentence for all criminal offences punishable with prison sentences or a fine and for all offences punishable with detention. In more cases than provided for under the old legislation, the public prosecutor will be able to demand a community sentence with a maximum of 120 hours or offer such a sentence in the form of a transaction. Effectively, this severs the link between community service and short-term imprisonment (TK 1997 - 1998, 26 114, no. 3 : 1 - 3). The aid to prisoners has also changed in some respects. In view of the capacity allocated to the probation service and the number of offenders, the probation service intends to devote its efforts to clients whose resocialisation will also have a social effect. This means that the level of social nuisance and repeat offending should decrease and that the clients should be able to function adequately in society again. In practice, this means that the probation service will only provide aid for ‘motivated’ clients. In addition, more attention will be paid to clients in the 16 - 25 age bracket, because it is expected that this group is still susceptible to attempts at behavioural change. In 1997, a government-sponsored evaluation study appeared in the United States into the effectiveness of punishment and therapeutic treatment of delinquents (Sherman et al. 1997). One of the conclusions of this study is that three methods have been proven effective for decreasing the number of repeat offences. Firstly, several programmes concentrating on resocialisation proved effective. One of the characteristics of these programmes is that they are highly structured. Furthermore, they concentrate on the development of social skills, improving the level of education, and teaching other skills that are useful for the labour market. The programmes employ psychological techniques to achieve behavioural change (Sherman, 1997 : 442). In the Netherlands, a programme with a similar approach is the ‘Stelselmatige Dader Aanpak’ (Systematic Perpetrator Approach) project, which has been running for some time. Secondly, therapeutic communities for drug addicts within a penitentiary setting appear to have a positive impact on reoffending (Sherman, 1997 : 442 - 443). This concerns projects that strongly resemble the ‘Drang op Maat’ (Flexible Compulsion) and ‘Strafrechtelijke Opvang Verslaafden’ (SOV: Counselling Addicted Offenders) projects. Thirdly, incapacitation is regarded as an effective means for preventing repeated offences. A prerequisite for the success of this measure is that those incapacitated should mainly be multiple offenders. If, however, less serious offenders were to be detained for long periods or even for life, the costs would outweigh the benefits. Determining which offenders should be incapacitated is still a major problem in criminal justice (Sherman, 1997 : 442 - 443). The enforcement of short-term imprisonment in closed and semi-open prisons mainly affects individuals on the fringe of society: addicts, the homeless, and the unemployed. In the past, individuals were considered either corrigible or incor- rigible. Today, many shortterm prisoners are labelled with the less-than-fortunate term ‘revolving door case’. On the one hand, this term seems applicable to persistent offenders who come into conflict with the law again and again. On the other hand, this creates a false impression of a judiciary system swamped by such cases without the legal authorities having any influence on this. However, the policy of the legal authorities itself contributes to the ‘production’ of this type of prisoners in two ways. Firstly, several social problems have increasingly become the domain of the Ministry of Justice. Secondly, repeat offenders are increasingly subjected to more severe punishments. Repeated imposition of short sentences will often contribute to offenders sliding even further downhill towards the fringes of society and increase the number of the down-and-out.
