40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are examined {{in an analysis}} of habitual late payment of trade credit by UK small firms. Multivariate logistic regression is employed to test the influence of variables expected to discriminate between small firms which pay late habitually and those which never or only occasionally pay late. Case studies extend quantitative analysis by validating interpretation of the results and providing explanations for unexpected outcomes. The results provide strong evidence of a financing demand for habitual late payment. There is a positive relationship between habitual late payment and difficulty obtaining bank finance and late payment by debtors and a negative relationship with the use of long term sources of finance. The influence of relationships between customer and supplier is shown to be complex. A concentrated supplier base is shown to be positively associated with late payment and case studies provide evidence that this is because increased knowledge of suppliers' credit management procedures is used to pay late without penalties. The implications of this result for the large number of firms that do not enforce their statutory right to <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> are highlighted.

The contract is based on Orgalime SE 01 with modifications taken from NTK 05 {{as to how to}} handle variations and the criteria for delivery. In the discussions in order to find the most probable outcome, one of the challenges has been to determine which exact contractual regulation is applicable to the subject matter, as the modifications that have been made, have not made use of the entire regulation from NTK, but only parts of it. Through a cost-income and project valuation analysis, it is determined which elements which has contributed to the largest decreases in contract value and it is shown that Orgalime is very contractor-friendly as concerns <b>interests</b> <b>on</b> <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> which is even far above the contractor s cost of capital. In order to establish a new contract document for the contractor to use on similar projects internationally, an analysis has been made of excisting internationational standards for EPC contracts, where a comparative analysis between FIDIC Silver Book and Orgalime Turnkey Contract has been made. It was found, not unexpectingly, that the Orgalime Turnkey Contract is much more contractor-friendly than the FIDIC alternative. There is made a detailed analysis of the Orgalime Contract with a set of proposed changes based on the experience from the previous projects.

The justifications for enacting this Act were the illiquidity of the business sector and the implementation of the EU Directive <b>on</b> combating <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> in commercial transactions. Yet, the Act includes several differences in comparison to the regime envisaged in the Directive. The time limits governing the performance of monetary liabilities in transactions between economic operators (undertakings) are identical with those in the EU Directive; however, the Act does not regulate payment in installment and does not provide for an extension of time limits unless expressly agreed. On the other hand, public authorities have a few privileges: time limits for commercial transactions between public authorities and economic operators are identical with the time limits for transactions between economic operators (whereas in the Directive time limits for public authorities are shorter); contracts on perennial procurement are exempt from compliance with this Act; and particular categories of public authorities should comply with the general time limits for commercial transactions as of 1 January 2016. Additionally, considering the prescribed misdemeanor sanctions applicable in cases where the debtor has failed to pay within the prescribed time limits, the purpose of the Financial Discipline Act remains unclear.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a survey of}} the literature on the determinants of inter-firm credit and on its implications for the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Theoretical explanations for trade credit can be divided in two categories: a) theories based on real functions performed by trade credit; b) theories based on transaction and financial motivations. The former category includes theories that interpret the supply of trade credit as a tool to achieve a variety of marketing objectives (to build customer relationships, as a guarantee for product quality, as a mechanism for price discrimination, as a response to demand variability). The latter category includes theories that consider trade credit as a tool to reduce transaction costs (as a substitute for money) or as a financial alternative to bank credit or to other forms of financing. The paper also examines the macroeconomic implications of these theories, with special reference to the relations between trade credit and monetary policy.
