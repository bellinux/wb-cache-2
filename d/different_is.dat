Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive's policy-making powers, {{as it is for}} public authorities, acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it is the job of the courts to determine whether an authority's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something <b>different</b> <b>is</b> a just exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|What makes Yoshi's Island DS <b>different</b> <b>is</b> the {{addition}} of five babies for Yoshi to carry, each bestowing a different ability — Baby Mario allows Yoshi to dash and makes special 'M' blocks appear, and can grab Super Stars to become Super Baby Mario, and grants ricocheting eggs; Baby Peach allows Yoshi to float and fly on wind currents and grants a more forgiving timing to use Yoshi's flutter jumping abilities effectively; Baby Donkey Kong can grab and swing on vines and ropes, grants a special dash attack, allows Yoshi's eggs to explode as per Yoshi's Story (but they do so on impact) and allows Yoshi to push objects faster; Baby Wario uses his magnet to attract metal objects and allows Yoshi's eggs to bounce; and Baby Bowser spits fireballs, but the Yoshi carrying him cannot make eggs, though the eggs Yoshi already carries can bounce. The last three babies tend to make the timing for Yoshi's flutter jumping less forgiving and slow down his movement a little bit. The need to switch babies at key points adds a puzzle element to the game.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, {{the notion}} of {{permutation}} relates to the act of arranging {{all the members of}} a set into some sequence or order, or if the set is already ordered, rearranging (reordering) its elements, a process called permuting. These differ from combinations, which are selections of some members of a set where order is disregarded. For example, written as tuples, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). These are all the possible orderings of this three element set. As another example, an anagram of a word, all of whose letters are <b>different,</b> <b>is</b> a permutation of its letters. In this example, the letters are already ordered in the original word and the anagram is a reordering of the letters. The study of permutations of finite sets is a topic in the field of combinatorics.|$|E
25|$|Like other settled, agrarian {{societies}} in history, {{those in the}} Indian subcontinent have been attacked by nomadic tribes throughout its long history. In evaluating the impact of Islam on the sub-continent, one must note that the northwestern subcontinent was a frequent target of tribes raiding from Central Asia. In that sense, the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions were not dissimilar {{to those of the}} earlier invasions during the 1st millennium. What does however, make the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions <b>different</b> <b>is</b> that unlike the preceding invaders who assimilated into the prevalent social system, the successful Muslim conquerors retained their Islamic identity and created new legal and administrative systems that challenged and usually in many cases superseded the existing systems of social conduct and ethics, even influencing the non-Muslim rivals and common masses to a large extent, though the non-Muslim population was left to their own laws and customs. They also introduced new cultural codes that in some ways were very different from the existing cultural codes. This led to the rise of a new Indian culture which was mixed in nature, though different from both the ancient Indian culture and later westernised modern Indian culture. At the same time {{it must be noted that}} overwhelming majority of Muslims in India are Indian natives converted to Islam. This factor also played an important role in the synthesis of cultures.|$|E

I don't think that what I did here was out of character for Scully. The only thing <b>different</b> <b>is</b> that the audience hadn't seen it before." [...] Initially, Anderson called up Morgan and asked him to write a story wherein Scully [...] "fall hard" [...] for another man, which leads to an [...] "intense kind of romantic or passionate relationship".

Further more, Stasiweski noted that while [...] "the fun, quirky music videos that pop-up can make this long half-hour worth watching [...] the 10 or so minutes in between numbers aren’t groundbreaking comedy." [...] Chris Schonberger from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a largely positive review. He called the new series [...] "the funniest hour of comedy on television" [...] and noted that the performance of Rhys Darby as Murray Hewitt was excellent, calling his character [...] "scene-stealing". Finally, Schonberger positively compared the episode to the 2004 comedy film Napoleon Dynamite, writing, [...] "Indeed, the whole pilot vaguely reminded me of Napoleon {{in the way that the}} characters just sort of lurk around and pour their limited energy into absurd activities".|$|E
500|$|USA Today praised Laurie's {{performance}} and the repercussions of the season-four finale, stating [...] "a carry-over from last season's brilliant finale, House is firmly in the forefront.

The New York Daily News noted that [...] "The show pays more attention to relationships we care about, hints at a sensible number of new ones that show some promise, and thus doesn't rely on obscure medical mysteries to carry the whole dramatic burden", and noted that [...] "the prognosis for this season could be better than last season seemed to foreshadow". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times highlighted the performances of the cast, especially Michael Weston as detective Lucas Douglas, calling him a [...] "delightful addition". She concluded, [...] "So <b>different</b> <b>is</b> the premiere that the savvy House (and Fox) viewer may expect the revelation that it was all a fever dream. That {{does not seem to be}} the case, and one assumes that Laurie and the writers will be bringing a different version of their now-iconic character back to Princeton. Not too different, of course, but different enough." [...] Conversely, The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan disliked Weston's character, calling him [...] "An unwelcome distraction... an irritating pipsqueak". She continued saying [...] "House used to be one of the best shows on TV, but it's gone seriously off the rails". The Sunday Times felt that the show had [...] "lost its sense of humour". The focus on Thirteen and her eventual involvement with Foreman also came under particular criticism.|$|E
