5|$|Zinc oxide as {{a mixture}} with about 0.5% iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) is called {{calamine}} {{and is used}} in calamine lotion. Two minerals, zincite and hemimorphite, have been historically called calamine. When mixed with <b>eugenol,</b> a ligand, zinc oxide <b>eugenol</b> is formed, which has applications as a restorative and prosthodontic in dentistry.|$|E
5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, {{the size and}} shape of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, the {{fragrance}} of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), <b>eugenol</b> and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, semisynthetic {{vanillin}} {{derived from the}} <b>eugenol</b> found in clove oil was commercially available.|$|E
25|$|A {{study found}} that Ef. surinamensis males have a marked {{preference}} for the compound vanillin, compared to 1.8 cineole and <b>eugenol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many natural aromatics, such as oakmoss absolutes, basil oil, rose oil {{and many}} others contain allergens or {{carcinogenic}} compounds, the safety of which is either governed by regulations (e.g. allowed methyl <b>eugenol</b> levels in the EU Cosmetics Regulation (Entry 102, Annex III of the EU Cosmetics Regulation.) or through various limitations set by the International Fragrance Association.|$|E
25|$|Several {{historical}} {{varieties of}} laudanum exist, including Paracelsus' laudanum, Sydenham's Laudanum (also known as tinctura opii crocata), benzoic laudanum (tinctura opii benzoica), and deodorized tincture of opium (the most common contemporary formulation), among others. Depending on the version, additional {{amounts of the}} substances and additional active ingredients (e.g. saffron, sugar, <b>eugenol)</b> are added, modifying its effects (e.g., amount of sedation, or anti-tussive properties).|$|E
25|$|Other caustic {{medications}} include <b>eugenol</b> and chlorpromazine. Hydrogen peroxide, used {{to treat}} gum disease, is also capable of causing epithelial necrosis at concentrations of 1–3%. Silver nitrate, sometimes used for pain relief from aphthous ulceration, acts as a chemical cauterant and destroys nerve endings, but the mucosal damage is increased. Phenol is used during dental treatment as a cavity sterilizing agent and cauterizing material, {{and it is also}} present in some over-the-counter agents intended to treat aphthous ulcerations. Mucosal necrosis has been reported to occur with concentrations of 0.5%. Other materials used in endodontics are also caustic, {{which is part of the}} reason why use of a rubber dam is now recommended.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} causes of {{toothache}} and its diagnosis is a specialist topic, meaning that attendance at a dentist is usually required. Since {{many cases of}} toothache are inflammatory in nature, over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help (unless contraindicated, such as [...] with a peptic ulcer). [...] Generally, NSAIDs are as effective as aspirin alone or in combination with codeine. However, simple analgesics may have little effect on some causes of toothache, and the severe pain can drive individuals to exceed the maximum dose. For example, when acetaminophen (paracetamol) is taken for toothache, an accidental overdose {{is more likely to}} occur when compared to people who are taking acetaminophen for other reasons. Another risk in persons with toothache is a painful chemical burn of the oral mucosa caused by holding a caustic substance such as aspirin tablets and toothache remedies containing <b>eugenol</b> (such as clove oil) against the gum. Although the logic of placing a tablet against the painful tooth is understandable, an aspirin tablet needs to be swallowed to have any pain-killing effect. Caustic toothache remedies require careful application to the tooth only, without coming into excessive contact with the soft tissues of the mouth.|$|E
2500|$|Kreteks are {{cigarettes}} {{made with}} a complex blend of tobacco, cloves, and a flavoring [...] "sauce". It was first introduced in the 1880s in Kudus, Java, to deliver the medicinal <b>eugenol</b> of cloves to the lungs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{demand for}} vanilla {{flavoring}} has long exceeded {{the supply of}} vanilla beans. , the annual demand for vanillin was 12,000 tons, but only 1,800 tons of natural vanillin were produced. The remainder was produced by chemical synthesis. Vanillin was first synthesized from <b>eugenol</b> (found in oil of clove) in 1874–75, less than 20 {{years after it was}} first identified and isolated. Vanillin was commercially produced from <b>eugenol</b> until the 1920s. Later it was synthesized from lignin-containing [...] "brown liquor", a byproduct of the sulfite process for making wood pulp. Counterintuitively, though it uses waste materials, the lignin process is no longer popular because of environmental concerns, and today most vanillin is produced from the petrochemical raw material guaiacol. Several routes exist for synthesizing vanillin from guaiacol.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment {{is usually}} symptomatic, (i.e., {{analgesic}} medications) {{and also the}} removal of debris from the socket by irrigation with saline or local anesthetic. Medicated dressings are also commonly placed in the socket; although these will act as a foreign body and prolong healing, they are usually needed due to the severe pain. Hence, the dressings are usually stopped once the pain is lessened. Examples of medicated dressings include antibacterials, topical anesthetics and obtundants, or combinations of all three, e.g., zinc oxide and <b>eugenol</b> impregnated cotton pellets, alvogyl (<b>eugenol,</b> iodoform and butamen), dentalone, bismuth subnitrate and iodoform paste (BIPP) on ribbon gauze and metronidazole and lidocaine ointment. A systematic review of the efficacy of treatments for dry socket {{concluded that there was}} not enough evidence to discern the effectiveness of any treatments. People who develop a dry socket typically seek medical/dental advice several times after the dental extraction, where the old dressing is removed, the socket irrigated and a new dressing placed. Curettage of the socket increases the pain and has been discouraged by some.|$|E
2500|$|Natural [...] "vanilla extract" [...] is {{a mixture}} of several hundred {{different}} compounds in addition to vanillin. [...] Artificial vanilla flavoring is often a solution of pure vanillin, usually of synthetic origin. Because of the scarcity and expense of natural vanilla extract, [...] synthetic preparation of its predominant component has long been of interest. [...] The first commercial synthesis of vanillin began with the more readily available natural compound <b>eugenol.</b> [...] Today, artificial vanillin is made either from guaiacol or lignin.|$|E
2500|$|Other common {{preventative}} measures {{center on}} reducing sugar intake. One way {{this is done}} is with sugar replacements such as Xylitol or Erythritol which cannot be metabolized into sugars which normally enhance S. mutans growth. Various other natural remedies have been suggested or studied to a degree, including [...] deglycyrrhizinated licorice root extract, Tea tree oil, Macelignan (found in nutmeg), Curcuminoids (the main components of turmeric), and <b>eugenol</b> (found in bay leaves, cinnamon leaves and cloves). Additionally various teas have been tested for activity against S. mutans and other dental benefits.|$|E
2500|$|Kretek: Kretek are {{cigarettes}} {{made with}} a complex blend of tobacco, cloves and a flavoring [...] "sauce". It was first introduced in the 1880s in Kudus, Java, to deliver the medicinal <b>eugenol</b> of cloves to the lungs. The quality and variety of tobacco {{play an important role}} in kretek production, from which kretek can contain more than 30 types of tobacco. Minced dried clove buds weighing about one-third of the tobacco blend are added to add flavoring. In 2004 the United States prohibited cigarettes from having a [...] "characterizing flavor" [...] of certain ingredients other than tobacco and menthol, thereby removing kretek from being classified as cigarettes.|$|E
2500|$|The various basils {{have such}} {{different}} scents because the herb {{has a number}} of different essential oils that come together in different proportions for various breeds. The strong clove scent of sweet basil is derived from <b>eugenol,</b> the same chemical as actual cloves. The citrus scent of lemon basil and lime basil reflects their higher portion of citral, which causes this effect in several plants including lemon mint, and of limonene, which gives actual lemon peel its scent. African blue basil has a strong camphor smell because it contains camphor and camphene in higher proportions. Licorice basil contains anethole, the same chemical that makes anise smell like licorice, and in fact is sometimes called [...] "anise basil." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{than being}} grown for their beauty, {{species such as}} P.graveolens are {{important}} in the perfume industry and are cultivated and distilled for their scents. Although scented pelargoniums exist which have smells of citrus, mint, pine, spices or various fruits, the varieties with rose scents are most commercially important. Pelargonium distillates and absolutes, commonly known as [...] "scented geranium oil" [...] are sometimes used to supplement or adulterate expensive rose oils. The oils of the scented pelargoniums contain citronellol, geraniol, <b>eugenol,</b> alpha pinene and many other compounds. The edible leaves and flowers are also used as a flavouring in desserts, cakes, jellies and teas. Scented-leafed pelargoniums {{can be used to}} flavor jellies, cakes, butters, ice cream, iced tea and other dishes, The rose-, lemon- and peppermint-scents are most commonly used. Also used are those with hints of peach, cinnamon and orange. Commonly used lemon-scented culinary species include P.crispum and P.citronellum. Rose-scenteds include P.graveolens and members of the P.graveolens cultivar group. Other species and cultivars with culinary use include the lime-scented P.‘Lime’, the lemon balm-scented P.‘Lemon Balm’, the strawberry-lemon-scented P.‘Lady Scarborough’ and the peppermint-scented P.tomentosum.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 and 1999, Chopra, {{along with}} two co-workers, Drs. Margaret Haydon and Gerard Lambert, testified to the Canadian Senate Standing Committee on Agriculture and Forestry that they were {{pressured}} by senior supervisors to approve multiple drugs of questionable safety, including Bovine Growth Hormone (rBST) and Baytril, which {{in the words of}} Chopra, [...] "is even more controversial. It's a critical antibiotic, one that produces cross-resistance against a critical antibiotic necessary for human use called ciprofloxacin. It's from the same class of drugs. When it is used in poultry, beef, turkeys, pigs, or whatever, then it causes cross-resistance in the intestines of those animals. Then those bacteria, like salmonella, campylobacter, or E. coli, get transferred to people and cause disease and death of immense order." [...] Prior to the mad cow disease crisis in Canada, Chopra warned the government that the current handling of feed to cows was inadequate. [...] Following this, Chopra, Haydon, Lambert and colleague Chris Bassude complained to the Public Service Integrity Officer (PSIO) office, a federal investigative body {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Treasury Board of Canada, indicating again that they were pressured by their seniors to pass a number of veterinary drugs, including Tylosin, Revalor H, Synergistin Injectable Suspension, Baytril, rBST, Carbodex and <b>Eugenol,</b> without proof of human safety. The PSIO case was initially dismissed in 2003, but the ruling was appealed to the Federal Court of Canada.|$|E
2500|$|The staves {{are then}} heated, {{traditionally}} {{over an open}} fire, and, when pliable, are bent into the desired shape of the barrel and held together with iron rings. Instead of fire, a cooper may use steam to heat up the staves but this tends to impart less [...] "toastiness" [...] and complexity to the resulting wine. Following the traditional, hand worked style, a cooper is typically able to construct one barrel in a day's time. Winemakers can order barrels with the wood {{on the inside of}} the barrel having been lightly charred or toasted with fire, medium toasted, or heavily toasted. Typically the [...] "lighter" [...] the toasting the more oak flavor and tannins that are imparted. Heavy toast or [...] "charred" [...] which is typical treatment of barrels in Burgundy wine have an added dimension from the char that medium or light toasted barrels do not impart. Heavy toasting dramatically reduces the coconut note lactones, even in American oak, but create a high carbon content that may reduce the coloring of some wines. During the process of toasting, the furanic aldehydes in the wood reach a higher level of concentration. This produces the [...] "roasted" [...] aroma in the wine. The toasting also enhances the presences of vanillin and the phenol <b>eugenol</b> which creates smokey and spicy notes that in some wines are similar to the aromatics of oil of cloves.|$|E
