5|$|The album's {{original}} cover art by Burton Silverman features a watercolour {{portrait of a}} long-haired, bearded man in shabby clothes. The idea for the cover came from a photograph Anderson's wife took of a homeless man on Thames Embankment, and Anderson later felt it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> have used the photograph rather than commission the painting. Ian Anderson recalls posing for a photograph for the painting, though Silverman claims it was a self-portrait. The artwork was commissioned and purchased by Chrysalis Records head Terry Ellis. Artist Silverman claims the art was only licensed for use as an album cover, and not for merchandising; and approached the band seeking remuneration for its further use. Silverman and Anderson have different accounts of level of enmity involved in this. The original artwork for both {{the front and back}} covers are now privately owned by an unknown family, apparently having been stolen from a London hotel room.|$|E
25|$|The FTC's {{decision}} {{to pursue the}} case came in for some criticism. Some commentators, who thought the case title was humorous enough to make extended references to the Superman comics in their commentary, questioned whether the commission's action against a retailer who did not deceive any American consumers was a wise use of its limited resources, and whether it might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> prosecute him in Britain. Another, {{in the course of}} criticizing the failings of the European Union's Data Protection Directive when it came to dealing with cloud computing, did not criticize the enforcement action as such but showed that it pointed out how much more work needed to be done in ensuring compliance with the Safe Harbor Program.|$|E
25|$|Oberst (Colonel) Leibrock, {{commander}} of BRIR 6, {{had been taken}} prisoner; after the war, he published {{a report on the}} fate of the regiment. He wrote that the regiment had not been placed under the command of the 28th Reserve Division and 12th Division, until the British-French preparatory bombardment had begun, {{that there had been a}} lack of material to build dug outs and obstacles and the work could not be done in daylight. The regiment had been split, battalions assigned elsewhere and companies had been used piecemeal as reinforcements. On 1 July, the commander lost telephone communication with most of the regiment and had no control over the supply of food and ammunition. Leibrock wrote that it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> move the regiment into line as a unit and move neighbouring units sideways. The infantry had fought a determined defensive battle and had been overwhelmed. In 2005, Sheldon wrote that the 2nd Army had lost the initiative on the Somme during the preliminary bombardment, rather than on 1 July and that the defence of the area south of the Albert–Bapaume road was conducted in an atmosphere of crisis, in which units were thrown into battle to plug gaps rather than as formed units, which increased German loses.|$|E

She also felt {{that it was}} a severe misjustice to the original storyline. Fans who were opposed to the storyline called it [...] "the re-rape", and ABC aired public service announcements (PSAs) during the Todd and Marty sex scene for their viewers. Berry supported ABC's use of the PSAs, but felt that they were used to justify the storyline and stated that it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> not have presented it in the first place. [...] Lynn Parrish, a spokesperson for Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), which was not consulted by the show's writers, spoke out against the [...] "re-rape" [...] storyline.

500|$|The Los Angeles Times praised Rudd's {{performance}} while criticizing his storyline and the mystery-of-the-week. While {{stating that}} Kristen Bell {{is usually the}} scene stealer, the reviewer thought that Rudd took on that role in this episode. However, the reviewer called his mystery [...] "an excuse just to get Rudd on the screen." [...] Missy Schwartz of Entertainment Weekly was also positive towards the episode particularly Rudd's performance and the episode's subplots. While criticizing the case-of-the-week's ending as anticlimactic, she thought that Rudd's singing was better than expected. The reviewer also lauded the comedic portions of the subplots, particularly the scene in which Dick compares himself to a lion and Mac and Veronica compare their romantic interests to cafeteria food. Brill Bundy of Zap2it was mostly positive towards the episode, particularly praising Rudd's comedic timing and the episode's use of supporting series regulars such as Mac and Piz. He also commented positively {{on the development of}} the romantic storyline between Piz and Veronica, stating that it was realistic. However, the reviewer did not think that the mystery involving Rudd's character was necessary and that it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> not have a mystery at all.|$|E
500|$|The obverse of {{the half}} dollar depicts Liberty, who is {{scattering}} fruits and flowers from a cornucopia held by a small, nude child. Behind them, the sun sets beyond San Francisco's Golden Gate, as yet unadorned by its bridge. Tom La Marre, in his 1987 article on the Panama–Pacific issue, pointed out that miners regarded the Golden Gate {{as a sign of}} good luck, and suggested it might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> depict it on a gold coin. The cornucopia, according to Burdette, demonstrates the advancement in trade brought by the canal, though the 1915 Report of the Director of the Mint states it [...] "signif the boundless resources of the West". [...] The obverse is based on Barber's earlier work, especially his medals for the annual Assay Commission. A representation of waves lies between the sun and the date, representing the maritime themes of the exposition. San Francisco's mint mark, S, is {{to the left of the}} date. [...] The reverse depicts an eagle atop a Union shield, flanked by branches of olive, symbolizing peace, something Swiatek and Breen found ironic given the coin's issuance during World War I, and oak, the latter a choice which they were at a loss to explain. The 1915 Mint Director's report deemed the oak branch an [...] "emblem of strength". Burdette notes that Barber's original design flanked the shield with two dolphins, representing the two oceans joined by the canal, instead of branches, and speculates, [...] "McAdoo either did not understand the allegory, did not care for it, or simply did not like aquatic mammals on coins". McAdoo may also have been suffering from a surfeit of dolphins, as the dollar and octagonal $50 pieces bear them—the ones on the half dollar were removed and replaced by the branches.|$|E

500|$|Based {{on common}} misconceptions and {{stereotypes}} about men in nursing, Greg's profession is repeatedly {{brought up by}} Jack Byrnes in a negative context and the character of Greg Focker {{has come to be}} one of the best known film portrayals of a male nurse. Even though men dominated the profession in earlier times, there has been a feminization of the nursing profession over the course of the last century which has caused men in nursing to often be portrayed as misfits by the media. A common stereotype is that of a man who accepts a career in nursing as an unfortunate secondary career choice, either failing to become a physician or still trying to become one. Such stereotyping is due to a presumption that a man would prefer to be a physician but is unable to become one due to lack of intelligence or non-masculine attributes. Jack Byrnes is often seen openly criticizing Greg's career choice per his perception of nursing being an effeminate profession. In their book Men in Nursing: History, Challenges, and Opportunities authors Chad O'Lynn and Russell Tranbarger present this as an example of a negative portrayal. Commenting on the same issue but disagreeing, Barbara Cherry in her book Contemporary Nursing: Issues, Trends, & Management called the portrayal of Greg as a nurse [...] "one of the most positive film portrayals of men who are nurses" [...] and commented that Greg [...] "humorously addresses and rises above the worst of all stereotypes that are endured by men in this profession." [...] Sandy and Harry Summers in the book Saving Lives: Why the Media's Portrayal of Nurses Puts Us All at Risk postulate that Greg's character, although intelligent and firm in his defense of his profession, [...] "might have done more to rebut the stereotypes" [...] while also reporting that [...] "some men in nursing" [...] expressed their opinions that it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> not present the stereotypes at all.|$|E

2500|$|A {{marginal}} note by Tolkien from {{around this time}} (the late 1950s) suggested that Gil-galad might be the son of Fingon. This suggestion was taken up by Tolkien's son and literary executor Christopher Tolkien in the published version of The Silmarillion, which states that Gil-galad {{is the son of}} Fingon. After the Dagor Bragollach and the ruin of Beleriand which results in the death of his grandfather Fingolfin, then High King of the Noldor, Fingon becomes the High King and sends a young Gil-galad to the Havens of the Falas under Círdan. This idea of Gil-galad being sent to the Havens was derived from material which the elder Tolkien had written at the time when he saw Gil-galad as the son of Finrod. After the disaster of the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the title passes to Fingon's brother Turgon. Morgoth assaults the Falathrim in great force after that battle but Círdan and Gil-galad manage to flee in their ships to the Isle of Balar. When tidings come to Balar about the sack of Gondolin and the death of Turgon, Gil-galad becomes the King. Gil-galad's name in the chapter [...] "Aldarion and Erendis" [...] in the Unfinished Tales was also changed by the younger Tolkien in order to keep consistency with the published version of The Silmarillion.—in the original version of that work he was noted as a son of Finrod. Christopher later stated in The Peoples of Middle-earth that this decision to make Gil-galad a son of Fingon was an editorial mistake on his part, and did not represent his father's conception of the character. [...] He suggested that it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> have left Gil-galad's parentage obscure.|$|E

2500|$|Season two {{received}} generally positive reviews but {{was criticized}} by commentators and fans {{for a much}} slower pace, less engaging storyline and lack of focus compared to the first season. Milo Ventimiglia stated that [...] "when there's {{a little bit of}} a delay, there's not that instant, rewarding scene or moment or episode... people get impatient, so it has been extremely important for them to strike a balance between giving and getting." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Heroes creator Tim Kring commented on criticisms of season two, and the series' 15% decline in ratings. Kring said that he felt he had made mistakes with the direction of season two. He had thought that the audience was looking for a [...] "build-up of characters and the discovery of their powers", when viewers were instead looking for [...] "adrenaline." [...] Kring also outlined what he felt were problems with plot development, stating that season two [...] "took too long to get to the big-picture story", explaining that Peter's vision of the viral armageddon should have occurred in the first episode instead of the seventh. He feels that it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> introduce new characters within the context of the main storyline, as with Elle, rather than in unattached arcs such as that of Maya and Alejandro. Kring also admitted that he should have resolved the [...] "Hiro in Japan" [...] storyline much more quickly, and that the romantic stories were not working well. With regard to Claire and West, and Hiro and Yaeko, he said, [...] "I've seen more convincing romances on TV. In retrospect, I don't think romance is a natural fit for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the {{crossover}} as a whole, Oliver Sava at The A.V. Club {{felt the}} episodes did [...] "admirable work advancing the overarching narrative while maintaining each show's distinct perspective" [...] along with being [...] "a {{hell of a}} lot of fun, and it's significantly expanded the scope of the Arrowverse by bringing in an extraterrestrial enemy... There's an entire universe to explore, and this crossover has opened the door for the CW's DC shows to go cosmic in the future." [...] Ed Gross for Empire stated, [...] ""Invasion" [...] is the proverbial mixed bag. As a crossover, it does an extremely effective job in bringing the characters from four different shows together, the rapport between them feeling natural and oftentimes genuinely funny... The real problem with [...] "Invasion" [...] is that it was intended to be, and was promoted as, a massive adventure, but in reality the whole Dominators storyline was rather underwhelming. Part of that is creative – it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> get a fuller understanding of who these beings really are and how they're able to know the long-term effects of Flashpoint; plus the resolution seems awfully pat... and lacks the resolutionary scope that was expected." [...] Despite some of the criticism, Gross gave the crossover 4 stars out of 5. Collider.com's Allison Keene said, [...] "On the positive side, the interactions among cast members of the four shows – Supergirl, The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow – were as delightful as ever. Though Arrow is often the anchor, The Flash usually sets the tone for the crossovers, and so the other shows incorporate its light-hearted, witty banter and a fast-paced action and editing... But on the negative side, the crossovers can also starkly highlight each show's weaknesses," [...] concluding, [...] "There are things [...] "Invasion!" [...] as a whole did really well, and others it didn't, with each series' strengths and weaknesses being highlighted and tested. But with each new expansion, there are things the shows can learn from, and it remains fun for fans".|$|E
