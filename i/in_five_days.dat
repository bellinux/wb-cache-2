5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, the player character's {{parachute}} fails to open. Awakening hours later, the character finds almost all his equipment inoperable. Reaching the pyramid on foot {{hours after the}} rest of the team entered the structure, the player must complete the team's mission before the god awakens <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>days.</b> In the pyramid, the player finds bodies of squad-mates, the remains of Spanish-speaking treasure hunters, and fallen members of a Nazi expedition from the 1930s who were looking for a secret weapon but never returned. Additional plot elements can be revealed by speaking to these dead, enabled by an item attainable early in the game, the yellow crystal.|$|E
5|$|Director Rob Bowman {{initially}} {{thought that}} the episode could be filmed <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>days,</b> two fewer than usual. However, it was actually filmed in three days after pressure from Paramount with two spent only on the sickbay set. He later said that he simply shot the framework for the clips to be added in later, and never saw a final cut of the episode. Production assistant Eric A. Stillwell was responsible for selecting the clips {{that went into the}} episode, with 21 different clips included. The prop used on Riker to fight the infection was created from drawings by designer Rick Sternbach.|$|E

The film then broke the UK opening weekend record, taking £15.5million ($25million) in its first weekend, surpassing the previous record of £14.9million held by Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. It earned a further £14million in France and Sweden—where it opened on the same day. The weekend gross of the equivalent of $10.6million in France was a record for the series, surpassing what Casino Royale made <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>days</b> by 16%. The $2.7million gross in Sweden was the fourth-highest opening for a film there.|$|E

5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>days</b> of violence that started on July 27, 1919. On that hot summer day, on a segregated Chicago beach, a white man was throwing rocks at black swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully held them off.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October 1912, Mawson {{outlined}} the summer sledging program. Mertz and Ninnis {{were assigned to}} Mawson's own party, which would use the dogs to push quickly {{to the east of}} the expedition's base in Commonwealth Bay, towards Victoria Land. The party departed Cape Denison on 10 November, heading first to Aladdin's Cave, and from there south-east towards a massive glacier encountered by Aurora on the outward journey. Mertz skied ahead, scouting and providing a lead for the dogs to chase; Mawson and Ninnis manoeuvred the two dog teams behind. They reached the glacier on 19 November; negotiating fields of crevasses, it was crossed <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>days.</b> The party made quick progress once on the plateau again, but they soon encountered another glacier, far larger than the first. Despite strong winds and poor light, Mertz, Mawson and Ninnis reached the far side on 30 November.|$|E
5|$|On December1, Epsilon began a {{northeast}} motion due to {{an approaching}} trough, {{and the next day}} it attained hurricane status. After turning to the east, it developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, meaning it had a circular eye, a ring of convection, and had few fluctuations in its intensity. On December5 Epsilon attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h), and the next day it turned to the south and southwest. Late on December7, the winds dropped below hurricane status for the first time <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>days,</b> making Epsilon the longest-lasting December hurricane on record. Stronger wind shear caused rapid weakening, and the storm could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone late on December8. The next day the remnant circulation of Epsilon dissipated.|$|E

5|$|The {{next three}} {{game for the}} All Blacks would be played <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>days.</b> The All Blacks scored 13 tries, and Jimmy Hunter five of them, as they ran up a 47–0 victory over Oxford University. Their next match, two days later, was against Cambridge University. The Scotland Test was approaching, and the All Blacks decided to rest several players, Hunter, Billy Stead, Selling and George Gillett. Cambridge's kicking game, and fast backs helped them to {{restrict}} the score to 14–0 to the All Blacks. Two days later the All Blacks faced Richmond, and scored five tries to register a 17–0 victory. Their last game before the Scotland Test was against a Bedford XV in Richmond. There were four All Black tries in the first half, and six in the second. The final score was 41–0; the All Blacks had now scored over 600 points on tour.|$|E
5|$|Civilians in Masan posed an {{unexpectedly}} dangerous {{problem for the}} UN forces. The town had a large community of Communist sympathizers and agents. At {{the peak of the}} North Korean offensive, Han Gum Jo, manager of the Masan branch of the Korean Press Association, confessed that he was chief of the South Korean Labor Party in Masan and that he had been funneling information to the North Koreans through a Pusan headquarters. Additionally, the chief of the Masan prison guards was found to be the head of a Communist cell that included seven of his subordinates. This, and other counterintelligence information, came to light {{at a time when the}} most intense fighting was in progress only a few miles away. Kean considered the situation so dangerous that he ordered Masan evacuated of all people except police, public officials, railroad and utility workers, and necessary laborers and their families. Evacuation was to be completed <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>days.</b> On September 10 and 11 alone the 25th Division evacuated more than 12,000 people by Landing Ship Tank (LST) from Masan.|$|E
5|$|Despite its mixed {{critical}} reception, The Phantom Menace was {{a financial}} success, breaking many box office records in its debut. It broke s {{records for the}} largest single-day gross for taking more than $28 million in the opening day and fastest to gross $100 million <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>days.</b> It grossed $64.8 million in its opening weekend, the second-ever highest at the time. It also became the quickest film to reach the $200 million and $300 million marks, surpassing Independence Day (1996) and Titanic (1997) respectively. The Phantom Menace was 1999's most successful film, earning $431.1 million in North America and $493.2 million in other territories, taking $924.3 million worldwide. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 84.8 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run. At that time, the film was the third highest-grossing film in North America behind Titanic and Star Wars (1977), and the second highest-grossing film worldwide behind Titanic without adjusting for inflation of ticket prices. When adjusted for ticket price inflation, it ranked as the 19th-highest-grossing film domestically, making it the fourth Star Wars film {{to be in the}} Inflation-Adjusted Top 20. Outside North America, the film grossed over $10 million in Australia ($25.9 million), Brazil ($10.4 million), France and Algeria ($43 million), Germany ($53.9 million), Italy ($12.9 million), Japan ($109.9 million), Mexico ($12 million), Spain ($25 million), and the United Kingdom and Ireland ($81.9 million).|$|E

5|$|In Oman, {{production}} of desalinated water was interrupted, as both of Oman's desalination plants failed. The first, Ghubrah, lost supplies of natural gas, halting production; while the second, Barka, sustained a damaged switchgear due to flooding. These plants provided water to Muscat's 631,000residents and surrounding areas, triggering severe water shortages across eastern Oman. To rectify the situation, officials used water tanks. The water returned to near normal <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>days,</b> {{as the two}} plants returned to service. Additionally, electricians worked quickly to repair the power outages across the region. Five days after Gonu hit, utilities were restored to most of Muscat and the coastal provinces. The Omani army assisted residents in returning to their houses. Even though the Omani government did not request any international aid, the United States offered assistance through naval ships in the area; this was eventually rejected. The country lost an estimated $200million (2007USD) in oil exports. In the months after the storm, the government allocated funds {{for the removal of}} debris and trees, as well as restoration of roads in tourist areas. Additionally, the National Committee for Civil Defence set up 139buildings to provide temporary housing for 8,192people. Services such as water and electricity were gradually restored, and people returned to their homes. By two weeks after the storm's passage, most of those remaining in shelters were from Qurayat, one of the most severely affected villages.|$|E
5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>days.</b> Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with a}} U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>days.</b> Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} continued patrol activity around Old Baldy Hill and Pork Chop Hill into 1953, digging {{tunnels and}} building a network of outposts and bunkers on and around the hill. In April, the North Korean Army began stepping up offensive operations against UN forces. During the Battle of Porkchop Hill, the Chinese 67th and 141st divisions overran Pork Chop Hill using massed infantry and artillery fire. The hill had been {{under the control of}} the 31st Infantry. The 31st counterattacked with reinforcements from the 17th Infantry and recaptured the area the next day. On 6 July the North Koreans and Chinese launched a determined attack against Pork Chop resulting <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>days</b> of fierce fighting with few meaningful results. By the end of July, five infantry battalions from the 31st and 17th were defending the hill, while a Chinese division was in position to attack it. During this standoff, the UN ordered the 7th Infantry Division to retreat from the hill in preparation for an armistice, which would end major hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.A4850, and {{one more}} on 28 April. This last day's {{fighting}} left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>days,</b> including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot {{it out in a}} head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine on the brink of seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.|$|E
5|$|Upon its digital {{release in}} April2010, Seili debuted at {{number one on}} the Finnish Albums Chart.
