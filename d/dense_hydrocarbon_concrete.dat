The goal is to obtain the high energy density of gaseous hydrogen fuel for combustion while still achieving the volumetric efficiency of much <b>denser</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fuels. A 1. 6 MW arc heater was modified to run on gaseous hydrocarbons, and a diagnostic chamber was developed to provide quantitative meas-urements of the products of pyrolysis. An electrical fault in the 1. 6 MW power supply occurred early in the test program, thus the experimental data were obtained by using a commercial plasma cutting torch that was modified to run on methane.

40|$|Microbial lipids offer a {{promising}} feedstock for renewable biofuels. However, {{one of the}} major concerns with their conversion from lipids into suitable fuels is the high sterol content of the lipid. This is especially problematic for lipids obtained from oleaginous yeasts, as there are some indications that the sterol content could inhibit catalyst performance during hydrotreating. In this investigation a sterol-rich model feedstock (a 50 : 50 mixture of cholesterol and rapeseed oil, “RC 50 ”) and an unrefined microbial lipid derived from the oleaginous yeast Metschkownia pulcherrima were converted to a diesel-like fuel in a single step via catalytic cracking. Far from reducing catalyst performance the cracking of the sterol groups liberated hydrogen, resulting in a reduction in the olefin content as well as an increase in the aromatic content of the fuel. The cracking of RC 50 over Pd/C resulted in a fuel with a comparable product distribution to ultra-low sulphur diesel (ULSD), with high levels of linear alkanes and approximately 10 wt% aromatics. Cracking of unrefined yeast lipid over Pd/C was shown to result in an energy <b>dense,</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fuel suitable for marine applications (unblended) or a road transport fuel at 50 % v/v blends with ULSD...|$|R
40|$|A single-event microkinetic {{model for}} the {{catalytic}} hydroconversion of hydrocarbons on Pt/H-US-Y bifunctional zeolite catalysts developed for low-pressure vapor phase conditions was extended to cover high-pressure vapor phase and liquid phase conditions. The effect of {{the density of the}} bulk hydrocarbon phase on the physisorption {{as well as on the}} protonation steps of the reaction network was accounted for explicitly and can be interpreted in terms of "compression" of the hydrocarbon sorbate inside the zeolite pores and "solvation" of the catalyst framework by the <b>dense</b> bulk <b>hydrocarbon</b> phase. The bulk phase density effect on the physisorbed state is described via a single excess free enthalpy of physisorption. A <b>dense</b> bulk <b>hydrocarbon</b> phase destabilizes the sorbate molecules inside the catalyst pores. An expression of the excess free enthalpy of physisorption involving the fugacity coefficient and a zeolite dependent factor allows description of physisorption data. Typical excess free enthalpy values are in the range 1. 5 - 5. 1 kJ mol(- 1) increasing with carbon number in the series of C 5 -C 16 alkanes. At high-pressure vapor phase and liquid phase conditions, the excess standard protonation enthalpy is estimated at - 7. 8 kJ mol(- 1) leading to relatively more stable carbenium ions at dense bulk phase conditions. As a result of the excess physisorption and protonation properties, the lightest hydrocarbons in mixtures are more competitive at dense phase conditions and their conversion is enhanced compared to low-density conditions. status: publishe...|$|R

NROSS couples electricity and transportation fuel production in a single operation, reduces lifecycle carbon emissions from the fuel produced, improves economics for the nuclear plant, and enables a major shift toward a very-low-carbon electricity grid. The nuclear reactor driving an NROSS system would operate steadily at full power, providing steam for shale heating in closed steam lines {{when the price of}} electricity is low and electricity to the grid when the price of electricity is high. Because oil shale has low thermal conductivity, heat input to the shale can be cycled as needed without disrupting the steady increase in average temperature. The target average shale temperature of 350 °C would be reached over 2 years using two heating stages in the baseline configuration driven by light water reactors. First stage heating brings the shale to an intermediate temperature, assumed to be 210 °C in this study. The second heating stage isolates the steam delivery line from the reactor and uses electricity, purchased when prices are low, to increase steam temperature and bring the shale to 350 °C. This capacity to absorb low price electricity mitigates the tendency for electricity prices to collapse to zero, or potentially negative values, during periods of peak wind and solar output. The analysis herein shows that liquid fuels produced by a baseline NROSS would have the lowest life cycle greenhouse gas impact of any presently available fossil liquid fuels and that operation as part of an NROSS complex would increase reactor revenues by 41 % over a stand-alone baseload reactor. The flexible, dispatchable electricity provided by NROSS could also enable the transition to a very-low-carbon grid in which renewables are widely deployed and the NROSS provides variable output to balance their uncontrolled output to meet demand. Fully deployed, NROSS could require tens or hundreds of reactors. Large fleet operations and local mass production of the necessary hardware could bring about substantial reductions in system cost as development proceeds, potentially offering a pathway to jump start and maximize the realization of the mass production cost savings envisioned for small modular reactors. The development pathway to achieve large scale NROSS deployment will be complicated, however, requiring involvement from many government agencies, a demonstration system, and a complex commercialization effort with partnered nuclear vendors, utilities, and petroleum system developers. by Daniel Joseph Curtis.

However, a penetration of the hardened cement materials by Trichlorethylene effects an extraction of water and a coarsening of the pore structure. In addition to this, chloride ions are produced in the structure of cement bound materials by the decay of Trichlorethylene.

Impedance measurements were made using a horizontal plane of 12 electrodes positioned at regular intervals around {{the centre of the}} column. A 2 D inversion algorithm, which incorporated the cylindrical geometry of the column, {{was used to}} reconstruct resistivity and phase images from the measured data. Differential time-lapse images of DNAPL movement past the plane of electrodes were generated by the cell-by-cell subtraction of resistivity and phase baseline models from those associated with the DNAPL release stage of the experiment. The DNAPL pulse was clearly delineated as resistive anomalies in the differential time-lapse resistivity images. The spatial extent of the resistive anomalies indicated that in addition to vertical migration, some lateral spreading of the DNAPL had occurred. Residual contamination could be detected after quasi-static conditions were reestablished. Residual DNAPL saturation was estimated from the resistivity model data by applying Archie's second equation. Despite significant measured phase changes due to DNAPL contamination, the differential phase images revealed only weak anomalies associated with DNAPL flow; these anomalies could be seen only in the initial stages of the experiment during peak flow through the plane of electrodes. ...|$|R
40|$|The Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and Alkaline Membrane Fuel Cell (AMFC) are two {{technologies}} that may enable {{more efficient and}} scalable conversion of chemical energy stored in a given fuel. Electrical power is provided from these devices when the chemical energy stored in the respective fuel(s) and oxidant(s) are electrochemical converted to electrical power, {{which can be used}} to perform external work. The SOFC and AMFC are attractive as energy conversion devices because they present opportunities to use a variety of energy <b>dense</b> and easy-to-store <b>hydrocarbons</b> fuels, such as methane and primary alcohols, respectively. Oxygen from ambient air is available as an oxidant for both devices. However, both of these technologies have limitations in the forms of performance, degradation, stability, reliability, and cost. ^ Complex heterogeneous architectures are used to support the transport and reaction processes; however, these architectures introduce many of these limitations in these systems. The functional processes that these architectures support are not only complex, but occur and are coupled across a variety of time and length scales. From an engineer 2 ̆ 7 s perspective, the coupling of the transport and reaction processes is realized at the fundamental level of the complex heterogeneous structures.

40|$|From far-ultraviolet (FUV) {{spectra of}} B stars {{taken with the}} Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT) and Voyager space observations, we {{determine}} the far-ultraviolet extinction by Galactic dust and hydrogen absorption in the local spiral-arm clouds towards HD 25443 (B 0. 5 III), HD 37903 (B 1. 5 V), and HD 200775 (B 3 Ve). We find that the (n (H)) = 1. 3 cu cm and number fraction (f = 0. 31) of H atoms in molecular hydrogen relative to the total hydrogen indicates a mostly diffuse medium toward HD 25443. We also determine f = 0. 56 for the gas in the photodissociation region (PDR) in front of HD 37903 and f approximately equals 0. 36 for the HD 200775 PDR. The inferred ratios of N(H 2) /I(CO) = 2. 4 to 2. 8 x 10 (exp 20) /K(km/s) /sq cm for cool gas in dark clouds agree with previous canonical estimates of N(H 2) /I(CO) = 2 to 3 x 10 (exp 20) /K(km/s) /sq cm and {{support the use of}} the ratio for determining masses of molecular clouds. We find that the shape and strength of the HD 25443 FUV extinction is the same as a diffuse-medium mean extinction (R(sub nu) = 2. 95) extrapolated from mid-UV wavelengths (normal). The HD 37903 FUV extinction through a bright H 2 photodissociation region is higher than a mean FUV extinction(R(sub nu) = 4. 11), as is the HD 200775 extinction. Another star from the literature rho Oph, probes the dense medium and exhibits an FUV extinction of normal mean strength (R(sub nu) = 4. 55) but steeper shape. The normal FUV -extinction of HD 25443 implies that the small FUV-extinction dust in the diffuse medium forms in p art from larger grains as the grains shatter under shocks. The normal strength of the rho Oph FUV-extinction indicates that the minute dust condenses onto or coagulates into larger grains in the dense medium. The high extinction deviation of the HD 37903 PDR (and HD 200775 PDR) shows that FUV radiation from hot stars with T(sub eff) approximately equals 20, 000 to 23, 000 K in PDRs can evaporate some of the FUV-extinction dust from grain surfaces. In contrast, previously measured extinctions in Galactic H(+) (H II) regions shows that FUV radiation at T(sub eff) greater than 25, 000 K can destroy some of the dust in H(+) regions. Thus, some of the FUV-extinction dust is highly volatile. We find that the dust carrier of the variable FUV-extinction is correlated (r = 0. 99) with the mid-IR (12 micrometers) radiation from hydrocarbon dust. The volatile FUV-extinction component could thus be due to minute hydrocarbon dust particles or macromolecules, probably PAHs, which are known to condense onto larger grains in the dense medium. Larger grains compsed of PAHs clustered into a solid could thus produce the steep FUV extinction of the rho Oph dense medium. After exposure to FUV photons wihtin approximately 1 pc of HD 37903, PAHs with about 30 carbon atoms would evaporate off the larger grains, increasing gaseous PAH abundance by approximately 14 %. Also, after receiving shocks in the diffuse medium toward HD 25443, the larger hydrocarbon grains would shatter into PAH molecules. In summary, as the Galactic medium cycles betwee n the diffuse and <b>dense</b> medium, <b>hydrocarbon</b> dust cycles into and out of larger grains under the influence of shocks, radiation, and condensation...|$|R
