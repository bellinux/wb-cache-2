25|$|Fire Fighter (White helmet) is {{the lowest}} rank of {{operational}} fire personnel, {{but they are the}} most important, because they make up the numbers. These fire-fighters can be trained <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a more highly ranked person but they do not usually take a leadership role at an incident.|$|E
25|$|Between June 2000 and September 2004, Chechen insurgents added {{suicide attacks}} to their tactics. During this period, {{there have been}} 23 Chechen related suicide attacks in and outside Chechnya. The {{profiles}} of the Chechen suicide bombers have varied <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> {{the circumstances surrounding the}} bombings, most of which targeted military or government-related targets.|$|E
25|$|The early 1980s {{were very}} {{different}} from the rest of the decade, with some carryovers from the late 1970s. The early 1980s saw a minimalist approach to fashion, with less emphasis on accessories, and practicality considered <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> aesthetics. Clothing colors were subdued, quiet and basic; varying shades of brown, tan, and orange were common.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the {{slightest}} predilection left. I assure you I attach {{not the least}} importance to any opinions. The result of the varieties of boredom I have undergone, is a conviction (unless conviction is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment I entertain on the subject), that any set of ideas will do <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> good <b>as</b> any other set, and <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> harm <b>as</b> any other set. There's an English family with a charming Italian motto. What will be, will be. It's the only truth going!' ...|$|R
25|$|The elder sibling {{also may}} harm {{the younger one}} by {{controlling}} access to the food delivered by the parents. A-chicks always receive food before B-chicks. Although subordinate chicks beg <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> their dominant siblings, the older chicks are able to divert the parents' attention to themselves, as their large size and conspicuousness serve as more effective stimuli.|$|E
25|$|The devocalization {{procedure}} {{does not}} take away a dog's ability to bark. Dogs will normally bark <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> before the procedure. After the procedure the sound will be softer, typically about half as loud as before, or less, {{and it is not}} as sharp or piercing. So while the procedure does not stop barking or silence the animal completely, it is effective in reducing the sound level and sharpness of the dog's bark.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{spirituality in}} the period before Jesus was highly {{corporate}} and public, based mostly on the worship services of the synagogues, which included the reading and interpretation of the Hebrew Scriptures and the recitation of prayers, and on the major festivals. Thus, private spirituality was strongly influenced by the liturgies and by the scriptures (e.g., {{the use of the}} Psalms for prayer), and individual prayers often recalled historical events <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> they recalled their own immediate needs.|$|E

25|$|Justice Rehnquist, {{writing for}} the majority, held first {{that the fact that}} Camden adopted the discriminatory {{ordinance}} in its capacity as a municipality does not render it immune from review under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Secondly, he held that even though the ordinance discriminates against New Jerseyans who are not Camden residents <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> it discriminates against out-of-state citizens, New Jersey citizens at least have the chance to remedy the problem through the political process (the state legislature). Out-of-state residents have no such option.|$|E
25|$|Reflecting {{the nature}} of Bilingualism in Canada, Question Period is bilingual. Questions may be posed in either English or French and {{responses}} may be in either official language. Although English was the primary language in parliament in its early days, French is now spoken <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> English. Simultaneous interpretation is provided on English and French broadcasts of Question Period, on many news networks, {{as well as the}} Cable Public Affairs Channel (CPAC). Transcripts of Question Period are published in both official languages in the Canadian Hansard, as with any other proceedings in the House of Commons and its committees.|$|E
25|$|In 1935 {{he participated}} on the {{beginnings}} of FORJA (Fuerza de Orientación Radical de la Joven Argentina – Force of Radical Orientation of the Young Argentina), a group whose position has been classified as “peoples nationalism”. It was centered in the problematic Argentina and Latin America and on its discussions suggested “reconquer the political Sunday from our own land” since it considered the country was still under a colonial situation. It supported neutrality in WWII {{on the premise that}} was no great interest was in play in Argentina or Latin America, {{it was more of a}} rejection position towards fascism <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> communism.|$|E

25|$|Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb {{considered}} the royal treasury {{to be held}} in trust for the citizens of his empire. He made caps and copied the Quran to earn money for his use,. Aurangzeb constructed a small marble mosque known as the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) in the Red Fort complex in Delhi. However, his constant warfare, especially with the Marathas, drove his empire to the brink of bankruptcy <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the wasteful personal spending and opulence of his predecessors. Aurangzeb knew he would not return to the throne after his final campaign against the Marathas in 1706, in which he was joined by newly emerging commanders in the Mughal army such as Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha, Saadat Ali Khan and Asaf Jah I, and Daud Khan.|$|E
25|$|All in all, Bannerman made six {{trips to}} England, and {{he enjoyed the}} actual touring of the Mother Country <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he did playing cricket there; indeed, many of his most memorable {{experiences}} occurred in places where his contribution on the field was negligble. He played {{in three of the}} most historically important matches of his era - the match with the M.C.C. in 1878 that the Australians won in less than a day, that first-ever Test in 1880 and the Ashes-igniter at the Oval in 1882, in which he had one of the better games amongst the batsmen, scoring nine for a strike-rate of 10.34 in the first innings, and a boundary-less thirteen from an hour and ten minutes in the second, holding up one end while Massie launched his famous assault from the other.|$|E
25|$|Marciano is {{commonly}} {{remembered as a}} swarmer due to his use of constant pressure in the ring, but {{he has also been}} called a slugger and a brawler; he was essentially all three. A late starter in the sport with little training and a short amateur career, he lacked the skills and finesse of most heavyweight champions, but he made up for it in brute force and raw power. Early in his career, he was notorious for his punching power, holding 11 first-round knockouts to his name. As the opposition got better, Marciano relied on his incredible stamina, relentlessness, and ability to fight rough and swarm on the inside to get him through fights <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the power. He sometimes went entire fights being pummeled by opponents such as Jersey Joe Walcott, Ezzard Charles, and Archie Moore, but came on strong as his opponent faded. He was also noted for hitting his opposition on their arms while they were blocking. Although this did not score points, over the rounds, it made their arms numb and essentially useless. Rocky faced criticism over his career for poor foot movement and for taking too many shots: he used weaving, but was often caught coming in. This, however, did not matter because he was able to take the shots. He is now known for having one of the best chins in boxing history, being knocked down just twice in his entire career, both times more to do with poor balancing rather than being dazed.|$|E

500|$|Foster's theorem {{is quite}} general. [...] In particular, {{it applies to}} {{distributed}} element networks, although Foster formulated {{it in terms of}} discrete inductors and capacitors.

500|$|Though {{the modest}} Yankovic himself laughs off the notion, {{we can all}} agree that [...] "Another One Rides the Bus" [...] embodies the anarchic spirit of punk rock <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> {{anything}} Johnny Rotten or The Clash ever recorded. It's the essence of punk: an enraged, defiant malcontent with a long list of grievances screaming his pain to an indifferent world. [...] Yankovic came to symbolize a curiously ubiquitous fixture of new wave: the enraged geek.|$|E
500|$|Dreyer had {{prepared}} a Danish {{version of the}} film {{which was based on}} the German version with Danish subtitles and title cards. The distributor could not afford to have the title cards completed in the manner they appear in the German version, which were instead finished with a more simple style. The distributor also wanted to make the pages in the book shown in the film as plain title cards which Dreyer did not allow, saying that [...] "the old book is not an text in the ordinary sense, but an actor. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the others." ...|$|E
