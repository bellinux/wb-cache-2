5|$|Although ministers are {{entitled}} to obtain views from other departments or ministries when making decisions, they must consider objections and not disable themselves from exercising their <b>discretion.</b> <b>In</b> H. Lavender and Son Ltd. v. Minister of Housing and Local Government (1969), the Housing Minister's decision was quashed because he had, by his stated policy, delegated to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food the effective decision on any appeal where the latter had an objection.|$|E

5|$|Limiting the {{availability}} of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 x 500mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 x 500mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's <b>discretion.</b> <b>In</b> Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively. Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers {{had a significant effect}} in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.|$|E

Gage's decision to act promptly {{may have been}} influenced by information he received on April 15, from a spy within the Provincial Congress, telling him that although the Congress was still divided on the need for armed resistance, delegates were being sent to the other New England colonies to see if they would cooperate in raising a New England army of 18,000 colonial soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Singapore {{is defined}} by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore to mean the Executive branch of government, which is made up of the President and the Cabinet of Singapore. Although the President acts in her {{personal}} <b>discretion</b> <b>in</b> the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, her role is largely ceremonial. It is the Cabinet, composed of the Prime Minister and other Ministers appointed on his advice by the President, that generally directs and controls the Government. The Cabinet is formed by the political party that gains a simple majority in each general election.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Naimski, {{as a head}} of the State Protection Office, {{started the}} process of {{screening}} people suspected of being Communist collaborators in Poland. In June that year he helped Antoni Macierewicz prepare a list of 64 members {{of the government and}} parliament who were named as spies in the police records; these included Wałęsa, then the Polish president. Wałęsa's name was included on the list after a wrenching internal debate about the virtues of honesty versus political <b>discretion.</b> <b>In</b> response to the publication of this list, President Wałęsa immediately engineered the fall of prime minister Jan Olszewski and the dismissal of Interior Minister Macierewicz. A parliamentary committee later concluded Wałęsa had not signed an agreement with the secret police.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal {{expanded}} the scope of judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive <b>discretion.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to the subjective test, the objective test permits the court to examine whether the decision-maker's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes specified by the ISA. The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test was only part of the obiter dicta of the case. The ratio decidendi of the case was based on narrower technical grounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of ministerial discretion, it has been {{established}} in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works (1943) that it is not unlawful for a civil servant to take a decision on behalf of the minister, even where a statute confers discretion on a minister. Parliament will expect only that the power is to be exercised by an appropriate official. However, the minister is ultimately responsible for decisions taken on his or her behalf. While there has been discussion in case law about whether a minister should be required to personally exercise <b>discretion</b> <b>in</b> decisions that affect a person's liberty, the courts have usually been reluctant to hold so. Such a requirement, however, has been made by way of statutes which require the minister to act personally.|$|E

5|$|Relations between Reddy and Desai soon soured {{over the}} latter's {{promotion}} of his son, Kanti Desai, {{in politics and}} over Desai's communication with Chief Ministers Vengala Rao and Channa Reddy {{on the issue of}} land ceilings in Andhra Pradesh. Following mass defections from the Janata Party and from the cabinet, Morarji Desai's 30-month-old government ended in July 1979 after he handed in his resignation to Reddy before a no-confidence motion could be tabled against his government in Parliament. Reddy's actions following Desai's resignation have been much debated. His decision to accept Desai's resignation before an alternative government created a ministerial vacuum in the executive according to H. M. Seervai. The faction of the Janata Party supporting Desai continued to have the support of 205 MPs as opposed to Charan Singh's 80 MPs. Reddy used presidential <b>discretion</b> <b>in</b> choosing Charan Singh as the next Prime Minister over a contending claim from Jagjivan Ram, the leader of the Janata Party.|$|E
5|$|The Veterans Administration (VA), {{charged with}} {{implementing}} {{the provisions of}} the G.I. Bill, denied benefits to blue-discharge veterans, despite the Bill's explicit language that made only a dishonorable discharge grounds for denying benefits to a veteran. In 1945, the VA issued a directive that all blue-discharges for homosexuality would be denied benefits. On December 22, 1955, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an appeal from Raymond W. Longernecker, who had been denied his G.I. Bill benefits by the VA because of his blue discharge. The Court found that the VA had <b>discretion</b> <b>in</b> awarding benefits and that Congress had specifically foreclosed the courts from overruling it. Nevertheless, the Court noted that the denial of benefits should only have occurred if Longernecker had been dishonorably discharged and that the VA Administrator was acting without authority in treating a blue discharge as if it were dishonorable.|$|E
5|$|The {{capabilities}} and reactionary {{nature of the}} judges have been criticized. The main complaint reportedly made by Saudis privately is that judges, who have wide <b>discretion</b> <b>in</b> interpreting the Sharia, have no knowledge, and are often contemptuous, of the modern world. Reported examples of judges' attitudes include rulings banning {{such things as the}} children’s game Pokémon, telephones that play recorded music, and sending flowers to hospital patients. Saudi judges come from a narrow recruitment pool. By one estimate, 80% of the 600+ Saudi judges and almost all senior judges come from Qasim, a province {{in the center of the}} country with less than 5% of Saudi's population, but known as the strict religious Wahhabi heartland of Saudi Arabia. Senior judges will only allow like-minded graduates of select religious institutes to join the judiciary and will remove judges that stray away from rigidly conservative judgments.|$|E

5|$|The {{drawing up}} {{of a regular}} season {{schedule}} had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league's inception. The crux {{of the problem was}} the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team's win-loss record. The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the sole <b>discretion</b> <b>in</b> developing the league's schedule. He utilized this responsibility to, early in the season, pit the weaker teams against other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams. His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{executive}} {{authority of}} Singapore is vested in the President and is exercisable by him {{or by the}} Cabinet of Singapore or any Minister authorized by the Cabinet. However, the President normally plays a nominal and largely ceremonial role {{in the executive branch}} of government. Although the President acts in his personal <b>discretion</b> <b>in</b> the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, he is otherwise required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet. It is the Cabinet that has the general direction and control of the Government. As Singapore follows the Westminster system of government, the legislative agenda of Parliament is determined by the Cabinet. At the start of each new Parliamentary session, the President gives an address prepared by the Cabinet that outlines what the Cabinet intends to achieve in the session.|$|E
5|$|The governor's {{powers are}} {{enumerated}} {{in the state}} constitution. There have been four constitutions of Kentucky—adopted in 1792, 1799, 1850, and 1891, respectively—and each has enlarged the governor's authority. Among the powers appropriated to the governor in the constitution are the ability to grant pardons, veto legislation, and call the legislature into session. The governor serves as commander-in-chief of the state's military forces and is empowered to enforce all laws of the state. The officeholder is given broad statutory authority to make appointments to the various cabinets and departments of the executive branch, limited somewhat by {{the adoption of a}} merit system for state employees in 1960. Because Kentucky's governor controls so many appointments to commissions, the office has been historically {{considered one of the most}} powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, the governor's influence has been augmented by wide <b>discretion</b> <b>in</b> awarding state contracts and significant influence over the legislature, although the latter has been waning since the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the Autobiography, modern {{scholars}} tend {{to treat}} him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure {{in the composition of}} the work. He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial <b>discretion</b> <b>in</b> favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy. However, MalcolmX biographer Manning Marable considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable argues that a critical analysis of the Autobiography, or the full relationship between MalcolmX and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.|$|E
5|$|When {{a public}} {{authority}} fetters its discretion, it {{can either be}} said to have failed to exercise its discretionary power or to have been subject to external influences. In the Singapore High Court decision Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), two distinct forms of fettering of discretion were recognized: fettering of discretion through rigid adherence to a policy, and fettering of discretion by an unlawful delegation of authority. These two forms of fettering of discretion have been said to represent two elements defining the concept of <b>discretion</b> <b>in</b> administrative law – the first form relates to freedom of choice, and second form the notion of one's personal discretion.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{governor}} controls so many appointments to commissions—approximately 2,000 {{according to a}} 1992 estimate—the office has been historically {{considered one of the}} most powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, {{the governor}} is given wide <b>discretion</b> <b>in</b> awarding state contracts, further augmenting his influence. In the second half of the 20th century, attempts were made to curb the use of the governor's appointment power for political patronage. During his second term in office, Happy Chandler issued an executive order creating a merit system that forbade the hiring or firing of state employees for political reasons; his successor, Bert T. Combs, pushed a new merit system through the legislature, protecting it from abolition by executive order. Despite the presence of the merit system, many governors have been criticized for abusing their appointment power. In 2005, Ernie Fletcher and several members of his administration were indicted for violating the merit system in their hiring practices; the charges were later dropped as part of an agreement with the prosecutor, Attorney General Greg Stumbo.|$|E
