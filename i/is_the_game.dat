5|$|Famitsu {{praised the}} idea of making a game based around trials, which they found to be innovative, and found it exhilarating and fun to uncover witnesses' lies. Thomas Bowskill at Nintendo Life said that the game had changed his idea of what can make for a great game, and called it a masterpiece. Carrie Gouskos at GameSpot said that the game revitalized the {{adventure}} game genre. Michael Cole at Nintendo World Report said that the game's design and interface would make it a good choice for non-gamers as well. Bowskill called the investigation sections tedious and boring at times, but said that they were outweighed by the feeling of accomplishment from solving the cases. Craig Harris at IGN felt that the main issues with the game were its linearity, and how the puzzles are simple because of how the player can stop a witness testimony at any time. Cole, too, felt that the game was very linear, and that it was unclear how to proceed at certain points. He said that, because of how story-driven it <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> has low replay value; he still felt that players might want to replay it after a few years.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{consistently}} highlighted its comedic achievement. Game Informer said it {{is frequently}} hilarious, ranking it among the best comedic games ever released. IGN praised The Stick of Truth for its witty and intelligent satire of the role-playing genre, while others said {{that as well as}} being consistently funny, the game was suitably boisterous, shocking, provocative, self-effacing, and fearless in its desire to offend. Many reviewers agreed that much of the content was more appealing to South Park fans; some jokes are lost on the uninitiated but others said that enough context was provided for most jokes to be funny regardless of players' familiarity with the source material. IGN said that it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> South Park fans have always wanted, but some reviewers said that without the South Park license, the game's shallowness would be more obvious.|$|E
5|$|The player, as Yumetaro, must {{venture into}} the {{alternate}} dimension to rescue his new owner. The player character can jump and spawn stars above the horn on his head. The star is a central mechanic to the game, being necessary to defeat enemies found while also doubling as a platform, capable of being ridden to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. The player must make their way through six stages and six bosses to complete the game. Once the sixth boss is defeated, it is revealed that the girl is still missing and the game restarts from the beginning. To truly complete Gimmick!, the player must find a hidden area in each stage where a magic item resides. If one can obtain each all the magic items without losing every life (i.e. using no continues), a secret stage will appear in which an extra boss must be beaten. Only after this boss is defeated <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> completed in full, with a cutscene showing Yumetaro rescuing the girl and leading {{her back to the}} real world.|$|E
5000|$|Four players {{may play}} at once {{with one of}} four {{selectable}} characters: Sinbat (not a misspelling of [...] "Sinbad"), Ramaya, Goldor or Datta. Sinbat <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> young, handsome hero, Ramaya <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> young, attractive female, Goldor <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> muscle character, {{who appears to be}} older than Sinbat and Ramaya, and Datta is a spiritual-looking bald man.|$|R

25|$|Two-handed pinochle is the {{original}} pinochle game, while partnership, auction, and all other variants are derived from it. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> most similar to {{the original}} bezique game, whence pinochle derived. The only significant difference in its rules from bezique is the scoring.|$|E
25|$|Games drawn {{under the}} fifty-move rule before the endgame are rare. One example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> Filipowicz versus Smederevac, Polanica Zdrój 1966, which was drawn on move 70 without any captures having {{been made in}} the whole game and with the last pawn having been moved on move 20.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>game</b> {{received}} mostly positive reception. In general, <b>the</b> pros <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> art style, addictive gameplay, and multiplayer functionality. The {{most common}} cons <b>were</b> that <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>was</b> unoriginal and its repetitive gameplay.|$|R
50|$|Although {{relatively}} few copies <b>were</b> released, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> has received favorable reviews. Often cited <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> appealing graphics, sense of humor, and effective {{teaching of the}} various aspects of Chess.|$|R

25|$|There {{are also}} some {{computational}} models which focus on protein–protein interactions and networks. There are also tools which are used for T and B cell epitope mapping, proteasomal cleavage site prediction, and TAP– peptide prediction. The experimental data is very much important to design and justify the models to predict various molecular targets. Computational immunology tools <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> between experimental data and mathematically designed computational tools.|$|E
25|$|Players become fourth-party developers, {{allowing}} for more open source models of game design, development and engineering. Players also create modifications (mods), {{which in some}} cases become just as popular as the original game {{for which they were}} created. An example of this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> Counter-Strike, which began as a mod of the video game Half-Life and eventually became a very successful, published game in its own right.|$|E
25|$|The {{series has}} science fiction and horror elements, and {{philosophical}} and supernatural themes. A recurring theme {{is the concept}} of morphogenetic fields, which is explored in different ways in each game, and is the main theme of the first game. The second game focuses on game theory, specifically on the prisoner's dilemma. The third game's main theme is morality, and it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in the series with the largest focus on philosophy.|$|E

25|$|The game can be {{generalized}} to an m,n,k-game in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on an m'n board, {{with the goal of}} getting k of their own color in a row. Tic-tac-toe is the (3,3,3)-game. Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization of tic tac toe. It can also {{be generalized}} as a nd game. Tic-tac-toe <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> where n equals 3 and d equals 2. If played properly, the game will end in a draw making tic-tac-toe a futile game.|$|E
25|$|In {{this case}} {{there are two}} pure Nash equilibria: either both swerve to the left, or both swerve to the right. In this example, it doesn't matter which side both players pick, {{as long as they}} both pick the same. Both {{solutions}} are Pareto efficient. This is not true for all coordination games, as the pure coordination game in Fig. 3 shows. Pure (or common interest) coordination <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> where the players both prefer the same Nash equilibrium outcome, here both players prefer partying over both staying at home to watch TV. The {Party, Party} outcome Pareto dominates the {Home, Home} outcome, just as both Pareto dominate the other two outcomes, {Party, Home} and {Home, Party}.|$|E
25|$|The score {{achieved}} {{for each}} and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score, and the player with the lowest score wins in stroke play. Stroke play <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> most commonly played by professional golfers. If there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament, a playoff takes place between all tied players. Playoffs either are sudden death or employ a pre-determined number of holes, anywhere from three to a full 18. In sudden death, a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match. If at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre-determined number of holes, then play continues in sudden death format, where {{the first player to}} win a hole wins the tournament.|$|E

50|$|Tracy Ham <b>was</b> named <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> most {{valuable}} player. Ham threw for 213 yard and rushed for a touchdown. Stamps slotback Dave Sapunjis <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> outstanding Canadian hauling in eight passes for 113 yards.|$|R
25|$|Coordination {{games are}} {{closely linked to}} the {{economic}} concept of externalities, and in particular positive network externalities, the benefit reaped from being in the same network as other agents. Conversely, game theorists have modeled behavior under negative externalities where choosing the same action creates a cost rather than a benefit. The generic term for this class of game is anti-coordination game. The best-known example of a 2-player anti-coordination game <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> of Chicken (also known as Hawk-Dove game). Using the payoff matrix in Figure 1, a game is an anti-coordination game if Bnbsp&>nbsp&A and Cnbsp&>nbsp&D for row-player 1 (with lowercase analogues b > d and c > a for column-player 2). {Down, Left} and {Up, Right} are the two pure Nash equilibria. Chicken also requires that Anbsp&>nbsp&C, so a change from {Up, Left} to {Up, Right} improves player 2's payoff but reduces player 1's payoff, introducing conflict. This counters the standard coordination game setup, where all unilateral changes in a strategy lead to either mutual gain or mutual loss.|$|E
25|$|No-limit hold 'em {{has grown}} in {{popularity}} and is the form most commonly found in televised tournament poker and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> played in the main event of the World Series of Poker. In no-limit hold 'em, players may bet or raise any amount over the minimum raise up {{to all of the}} chips the player has at the table (called an all-in bet). The minimum raise is equal {{to the size of the}} previous bet or raise. If someone wishes to re-raise, they must raise at least the amount of the previous raise. For example, if the big blind is $2 and there is a raise of $6 to a total of $8, a re-raise must be at least $6 more for a total of $14. If a raise or re-raise is all-in and does not equal the size of the previous raise (or half the size in some casinos), the initial raiser cannot re-raise again (in case there are other players also still in the game). In pot-limit hold 'em, the maximum raise is the current size of the pot (including the amount needed to call).|$|E

Virginia Tech {{wide receiver}} Dyrell Roberts <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> second-leading receiver. He caught four passes for 44 yards. Tech's second-most proficient receiver was running back Darren Evans, who caught three passes for 22 yards. Evans <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> leading rusher, having carried the ball 31 times for 114 {{yards and a}} touchdown. On the opposite side, Boston College running back Montel Harris led the Eagles {{on the ground with}} nine carries for 34 yards.|$|R

[...] "Bill" [...] Alexander refused to allow his team to take the field if Ward played.
