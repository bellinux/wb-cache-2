40|$|Previous {{record of}} Xenobalanus globicipitis in Indian Ocean {{is from the}} South African coast (Natal and Saldhana Bay). A {{specimen}} of X. globicipitis, 22. 5 mm in length, was found attached to the fluke of a <b>finless</b> <b>black</b> <b>porpoise</b> (Neomeris phocoenoides) caught oflE Karwar by R. V. Varuna, and this finding extends considerably the known range of distribution of this species...|$|E
40|$|On 12 th November 1959, 17 {{porpoises}} were {{landed in}} a large shore seine, locally known as Rampani, and two {{more of the same}} variety in another, operated {{side by side with the}} former, at Malpe on the South Kanara Coast. The animals measured from about 3 £ to 5 feet in length and were characteristically greyish black throughout except for a slightly paler ventral side. The smallness in size, beakless condition, the prominent blunt rounded head and the absence of a triangular dorsal fin clearly indicate that the animal is the <b>Finless</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Porpoise,</b> Neomeris phocaenoides (Cuvier). Their occurrence in such large numbers at one place is of interest since previous records show that they are seldom seen more than two at a time. The species has a wide distribution in the Indo-Pacific ranging from Cape of Good Hope to Japan and is often known to ascend the estuaries of larger rivers...|$|E
40|$|<b>Finless</b> <b>black</b> <b>porpoises</b> {{are common}} in the nearshore waters and dead ones were washed ashore on many {{occasions}} along the Palk Bay coast around Mandapam and Rameswaram. On 31. 01. 2001, a female <b>black</b> <b>porpoise,</b> Neophocaena phocaenoides (Fig. 1) was landed at Sangumal (Palk Bay) near Rameswaram. Its total length and weight were 150 cm and 40 kg respectively. In the neck region the flesh was eaten by stray dogs. The porpoise was caught by gill net locally called as Vali Valai, operated off Rameswaram in the Palk Bay {{at a depth of}} 14 to 18 m...|$|R
50|$|Marine {{habitats}} include coral reefs, tidal salt marshes, mangroves and sea-grass kelp beds. Marine species include Mollusca, approximately 150 {{species of}} fish including carangids, emperors, snappers and sweet lips as well as barracuda, goatfish, grouper, lizard fish, rabbit fish, shark and thread fins. There are also Chinese white dolphin, dugong, grey dolphin and <b>black</b> <b>finless</b> <b>porpoise.</b>|$|R
50|$|At least 88 bird species, {{including}} the globally threatened Malaysian plover (Charadrius peronii) and Asiatic dowitcher (Limnodromus semipalmatus), {{can be found}} within the site, as well as 82 fish species, 18 reptiles, three amphibians, and 17 mammal species. These include the dugong (a vulnerable species), white-hand gibbon (Hylobates lar), the endangered serow (Capricornis sumatraensis), and the <b>black</b> <b>finless</b> <b>porpoise</b> (Neophocaena phocaenoides).|$|R
40|$|A <b>black</b> <b>porpoise,</b> Neophocaena phocaenoides Gi Cuvier {{was caught}} in a dol net {{operating}} off Seemar bunder, Gujarat. The animal is locally called "Gonio. " Local enquiry revealed that though there is no regular or targeted fishery for dolphins or porpoises, there have been stray occurrences of these mammals being captured by dol nets operated in the area. The nets { 16 m long) are usually operated at a depth of 8 m. The locals utilize the oil extracted from these animals for application on their wooden boats...|$|R
6000|$|... "But not too hot here," [...] remarked Ebony, {{going to}} a pool a little further from the fountain-head, where the water had cooled somewhat. There the negro dropped his simple garments, and was soon rolling like a <b>black</b> <b>porpoise</b> in his warm bath. It was only large enough for one, but close to it was another small pool big enough for several men. There Mark and Hockins were soon disporting joyously, while the Secretary looked on and laughed. Evidently he did not in the {{circumstances}} deem warm water either a necessity or a luxury.|$|R
60|$|Tim fell asleep. Bill Wrenn lay {{quiet and}} let memory color {{the sky above}} him. He {{recalled}} the gardens of water which had flowered in foam for him, strange ships and nomadic gulls, and the schools of sleekly <b>black</b> <b>porpoises</b> that, for him, had whisked through violet waves. Most of all, he brought back the yesterday's long excitement and delight of seeing the Irish coast hills--his first foreign land--whose faint sky fresco had seemed magical with the elfin lore of Ireland, a country that had ever been to him the haunt not of potatoes and politicians, but of fays. He had wanted fays. They were not common on the asphalt of West Sixteenth Street. But now he had seen them beckoning in Wanderland.|$|R
40|$|The flnless <b>black</b> <b>porpoise,</b> Neophocaena phocaenoides G. Cuvier {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the Indo-Pacific ranging from Cape of Good Hope to Japan and China and often known to ascend the estuaries of larger rivers. In India, this species is fairly common along the coasts of Bombay, Madras and Trivandrum. Since, porpoises are considered as endangered marine mammals, strict regulations have been imposed by the Government authorities for their conservation and management. Incidental catch of porpoises reported in the west coast is {{more than in the}} east coast of India as may be seen from the published information. It appears that propoise, Neophocaena phocaenoides frequents the coastal waters and gets captured on many occasions. More recently, incidental catch of porpoises are on the increase in Mandapam region...|$|R
40|$|Observations on the {{stranded}} {{marine turtles}} and mammals in {{a stretch of}} 10 km at Gahirmatha Beach, Orissa during 1983 to 1987 are reported here. The washed ashore marine turtles were due to the result of turtles getting entangled and drowned in fishing operations conducted off Paradip and adjacent area, the carcasses drifting northwards and ashore at Oahirmatha. In 1983 around 7 S 00 olive ridley Lepidochelys olivacea were washed ashore and the curved carapace length in cm varied from 51 - 72 (62. 2) and the carapace width in cm varied from 48 - 63 (57. 8). The number of stranded turtles was reduced to 360 in 1987 and {{this is due to}} the effective steps taken to enforce the Widlife (Protection) Act by the State Forest Departments. Strandings of Humpback dolphin Soma chinensis, Snubfln dolphin Orcaella brevirostris and <b>Finless</b> <b>black</b> propoise Neophocaena phocoenoides were also recorded. Mortality of nesting females during arribada could have an adverse effect on the breeding population of olive ridley visiting the rookery and consequently on recruitment. A careful study is needed to take preventive and precautionary regulatory measures to be adopted in specific type of fishing operations during the nesting season of olive ridley...|$|R
60|$|They {{were brought}} to the field of Marzun-Katai, and with the Black Boneens to aid, they fought a fight that has never been set down in the newspapers. In response, many believe, to the fervent prayers of Father Dennis, the enemy not only elected to fight in the open, but made a {{beautiful}} fight, as many weeping Irish mothers knew later. They gathered behind walls or flickered across the open in shouting masses, and were pot-valiant in artillery. It was expedient to hold a large reserve and wait for the psychological moment that was being prepared by the shrieking shrapnel. Therefore the Mavericks lay down in open order on the brow of a hill to watch the play till their call should come. Father Dennis, whose duty was in the rear, to smooth the trouble of the wounded, had naturally managed to make his way to the foremost of his boys and lay like a <b>black</b> <b>porpoise,</b> at length on the grass. To him crawled Mulcahy, ashen-gray, demanding absolution.|$|R
50|$|Most {{photographs}} of Burmeister's porpoises are taken of dead specimens {{and show the}} animal to be coloured black. This phenomenon {{gave rise to the}} earlier common name, <b>black</b> <b>porpoise.</b> However live individuals are typically a dark grey color. They turn black {{in just a few minutes}} after death. The underside varies in colour but is usually a lighter grey. Burmeister's are about 150 cm long when fully mature and weigh 50 - 75 kg. The maximum recorded weight is that of a female at 105 kg. They have a shallow indentation at their blowhole set just in front of the eyes. The shape and placement of the dorsal fin is unusual for a cetacean - it is triangular rather than curved and points backwards more than upwards. It is located about three quarters of the way along the back - further back than any other dolphin or porpoise. These features are sufficient to distinguish the porpoise from the similar-sized Chilean dolphin which is found in the porpoise's Pacific range.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} mercury (Hg) {{concentrations}} in different tissues (liver, muscle, kidney, blubber and brain) of harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena {{found dead in}} the Black Sea between 1997 and 1999, mainly bycaught in fishing nets (n = 79). Total Hg and organic Hg (MeHg) were determined. The main factor affecting Hg accumulation was, as expected, age, with MeHg concentration increasing with age. Accumulation of high concentrations of inorganic Hg in the liver was probably due to a slow demethylation process implying the formation of tiemannite (HgSe). In older adults, liver concentrations reached 35 µg g - 1 dry weight ('ppm') total Hg and 3 µg g - 1 dw MeHg. A geographical comparison with existing data from other regions showed a generally low Hg contamination of <b>Black</b> Sea <b>porpoises,</b> one order of magnitude lower than, e. g. in the North Sea...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{traffic is}} {{threatening}} cetaceans {{on a local}} and global scale. The Istanbul Strait {{is one of the}} busiest waterways, with up to 2, 500 vessels present daily. This is the first study to assess the magnitude of short- and long-term behavioural changes of the endangered <b>Black</b> Sea harbour <b>porpoises</b> (Phocoena phocoena relicta) in the presence of marine vessels within the Istanbul Strait. Markov chains were used to investigate the effect of vessel presence on the transition probability between behavioural states (diving, surface-feeding and travelling), and to quantify the effect on the behavioural budget and bout length (duration of time spent in a given state) of porpoises. Further, the changes on swimming directions of porpoises in relation to vessel speed and distance was investigated using generalized linear models. In vessel presence, porpoises were less likely to remain in a given behavioural state and instead more likely to switch to another state. Because of this, the bout length of all three behavioural states decreased significantly in the presence of vessels. The vessel effect was sufficiently large to alter the behavioural budget, with surface-feeding decreasing significantly in the presence of vessels. However, when taking into account the proportion of time that porpoises were exposed to vessels (i. e. 50 %), the measured effect size was not large enough to significantly alter the animals' cumulative (diurnal) behavioural budget. Additionally, vessel speed and distance had a significant effect on the probability of porpoises showing a response in their swimming directions. The southern and middle sections of the Istanbul Strait, which have the heaviest marine traffic pressure, had the lowest porpoise sightings throughout the year. Conversely, northern sections that were exposed to a lesser degree of marine traffic hold the highest porpoise sightings. The effect shown in this study in combination with increasing human impacts within the northern sections should be considered carefully and species-specific conservation actions, including establishment of protected areas, should be put in place to prevent the long-term consequences of marine traffic on the <b>Black</b> Sea harbour <b>porpoise</b> population...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{migration}} of harbour porpoises towards more polluted areas like the North Sea and their sensitivity towards pollution, {{there is a}} need for proper conservation measures for this species. As a consequence, knowledge about the pollutant 2 ̆ 7 s kinetics is required. The present study is the first to investigate the kinetics of PBDEs in marine mammals using PBPK modeling as a non-destructive tool for describing the chemical 2 ̆ 7 s kinetics in a protected animal species. The models were developed and parameterized using data from the literature and <b>Black</b> Sea harbour <b>porpoises</b> through computer optimization. The predictability of these models in time was assessed by reverse dosimetry modeling using data from North Sea porpoises (1990 - 2008). From these predictions, PBDE 99 levels were found to decrease the fastest, followed by PBDE 153, 47 and 100. Results show that the PBPK models can be applied for harbour porpoises from different regions and also simulate time trends...|$|R
40|$|Study of {{the genetic}} {{population}} structure and the demographic history of the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) has been nearly comprehensive throughout its distribution in North Atlantic, most studies using the mitochondrial control region as a genetic marker. Although these studies have shown population structure {{in some parts of}} the North Atlantic, mitochondrial DNA is a single, maternally inherited locus and therefore insufficient to fully characterize population structure and history. Polymorphism at 11 microsatellite loci was analyzed in harbour porpoises collected throughout the range of the species in the Central and Eastern North Atlantic from the Iberian peninsula northward to Arctic waters (Portugal, Spain, bay of Biscay, Irish waters, English Channel, the southern bay of the North Sea, Norway, Faroe Islands, and Iceland) and also along the coasts of the Black Sea (Turkey, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Georgia). Multilocus tests for allele frequency differences and population structure estimates indicate complete genetic isolation between Atlantic and <b>Black</b> Sea <b>porpoises.</b> No fine population structure was observed within the Black Sea, and this population displayed a low genetic diversity compared to those of Atlantic. These results can be interpreted in the light of the demographic history of this relict population and the strong founder effect and bottleneck it may have undergone in its past evolution. In Eastern North Atlantic waters, microsatellite data revealed fine scale partitioning {{of the genetic}} variation. These results will be compared to the pattern previously reported based on the analysis of the mtDNA control region, and seem to correlate with variation in oceanographic features.

40|$|There are two {{porpoise}} {{stocks in}} the northern Black Sea: the north-western (Odessa Gulf) and northeastern (Crimean and Caucasian waters); in addition, another stock is in the Sea of Azov. The Azov porpoises are distinct in their body size and biology. This research {{was conducted on the}} skulls of stranded sexually mature porpoises from the north-eastern Black Sea, north-western Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. In the north-eastern Black Sea samples, both present-day and old-time, the sexual dimorphism of the skull size was not significant, whereas in the Sea of Azov the females were significantly larger than males. The Azov skulls were strongly different from those from the Black Sea: they were larger, proportionally wider and had the wider rostra; also, there was no significant chronological variation within the Black Sea. The Azov and Black Sea samples were classified with the 100 % success with four variables. The northwestern Black Sea skulls were somewhat intermediate in their characteristics between the Azov and northeastern Black Sea samples, but they were classify ed together with other Black Sea specimens. The difference between the Azov and Black Sea skulls was greater than between many North Atlantic populations, despite the extreme geographical proximity of the two stocks. The low variation within the Black Sea supports the earlier conclusions on the lack of genetic variation: all the Black Sea stocks are expected to be genetically similar sub-populations, whereas the Azov and Marmara stocks possibly represent the genetically distant populations. The <b>porpoises</b> from the <b>Black</b> Sea and the Sea of Azov equally show the traits which characterize the subspecies Phocoena phocoena relicta, but the <b>Black</b> Sea <b>porpoises</b> appear to be more paedomorphic in terms of ontogenetic trajectories...|$|R
40|$|Perfluorooctane {{sulfonate}} (PFOS) {{and other}} perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFAS) were determined in liver, kidney, muscle, brain, and blubber samples of 31 harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena relicta) of different {{age and sex}} stranded along the Ukrainian coast of the Black Sea. In all individuals and in all tissues, PFOS was the predominant PFAS, accounting for on average 90 % of the measured PFAS load. PFOS concentrations were the highest in liver (327 +/- 351 ng/g wet wt) and kidney (147 +/- 262 ng/g wet wt) tissue, and lower in blubber (18 +/- 8 ng/g wet wt), muscle (41 +/- 50 ng/g wet wt), and brain (24 +/- 23 ng/g wet wt). No significant differences could be determined between males and females, nor between juvenile and adult animals (p > 0. 05). Perfluorononanoic acid, perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid, and perfluorododecanoic acid could be detected in liver tissue of approximately 25 % of the individuals. Perfluorobutane sulfonate, perfluorobutanoic acid, and perfluorooctanoic acid were not detected {{in any of the}} porpoise livers. Although we investigated a potential intraspecies segregation according to the source of prey, using stable isotopes, no statistically significant correlation between PFOS concentrations and stable isotopes could be determined. It is, however, noteworthy that the contamination by PFOS in the <b>Black</b> Sea harbor <b>porpoises</b> is comparable to levels found in porpoises from the German Baltic Sea and from coastal areas near Denmark and, therefore, might pose a threat to this population.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{whether there is}} evidence of widespread niche partitioning based on environmental factors in the Black Sea and tested the hypothesis that physiographic factors may be employed as predictors. It addresses poorly researched areas with good habitat potential for the only three cetacean subspecies living in this area: the Black Sea short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis spp. ponticus), the Black Sea bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus spp. ponticus) and the <b>Black</b> Sea harbour <b>porpoise</b> (Phocoena phocoena spp. relicta). Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to analyse data collected from multiple sources. In total, 745 sightings of the three species between 1998 and 2010 throughout the Black Sea were included. The analysis found depth and sea surface temperature {{to be the most important}} variables for separating the occurrence of the three species. Common dolphins occurred mainly in deep waters and in areas where the sea surface temperature was low, bottlenose dolphins were distributed primarily in shallower and warmer waters than common dolphins, and harbour porpoises were distributed in shallower waters with lower sea surface temperature than bottlenose dolphins. This study suggests strong niche segregation among the three cetacean species. The study is also the first contribution to the basic information of cetacean species distribution and habitat preferences in the Black Sea as a whole. Knowledge of the distribution of the three dolphin species in the study area is essential to establish conservation measures for these populations. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
