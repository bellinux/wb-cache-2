In 1912 he was <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> business by his youngest brother, Herbert, and his eldest son, Alfred, followed by his second son, Vernon, in 1913. In 1912 Dunhill introduced the white spot trademark to its pipes.|$|E
5|$|Vomag of Plauen began {{producing}} the Sd.Kfz. 9 in 1940 and Tatra <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{last years of}} the war. 855 were on hand on 20 December 1942. 643 were built in 1943 and 834 in 1944. Approximately 2,500 were built in total.|$|E

5|$|Antón, as expected, {{was named}} as the squad {{leader for the}} Vuelta a España. His goal was overall success. He was <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> squad by fellow Giro d'Italia stage winner Nieve, Martínez, Verdugo, Txurruka, Oroz, Isasi, Azanza and Cazaux. Nieve commented a day into the Vuelta that he would ride solely to support Antón, {{despite the fact that}} both had won Giro stages and he (Nieve) had {{actually}} finished the race higher overall.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the colonial}} period, the Pine Bush {{continued}} to be tapped for its natural resources, with water becoming a target for development. The Patroon Creek, roughly where three feeder streams <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heart of the Pine Bush along Albany's northern border, was dammed in 1850 to form Rensselaer Lake waterworks.|$|E
5|$|As {{political}} tensions escalated in {{the years}} leading to World War II, the Belgian government again announced its intention to remain neutral {{in the event of}} war in Europe. The military was reorganised into a defensive force and the country left several international military treaties it had <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of World War I. Construction began of defences in the east of the country. When France and Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, Belgium remained strictly neutral while mobilising its reserves.|$|E

5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{demand that the}} airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|At 11 am a {{disturbance}} {{started in the}} chapel at Strangeways Prison when some 300 prisoners attacked staff. Those prisoners then gained access to the chapel roof and then broke into the living accommodation in the main prison.

5|$|Breckinridge's front {{regiment}} was the 10th Kentucky Mounted Rifles, {{under the}} command of Col. Benjamin Caudill. Caudill's men dismounted and fired into the Union cavalry, inflicting minor casualties. As the rest of Breckinridge's troops began to arrive on the scene, Stoneman's soldiers secured elevated positions overlooking the river. Breckinridge observed that these hills were the best defensive positions in the area, ordering his front regiments to eliminate Union resistance on the hills. The rest of Giltner's Brigade also <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> charge, routing the Union soldiers and allowing the Confederate forces to use the defensive positions themselves.|$|E

5|$|Daimler-Benz and Krupp {{were the}} main {{builders}} of the Sd.Kfz. 8 during the war, but Krauss-Maffei produced 315 in 1940—41 and Škoda <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last years of the war. 1615 were on hand on 20 December 1942. 507 were built in 1943 and 602 in 1944. Approximately 4000 were built in total. The Sd.Kfz. 8 was used by Czechoslovakia after the war, {{but it is not}} known if production continued at Škoda or when they were finally discarded.|$|E
5|$|Ensemble Studios worked {{together}} with Big Huge Games to develop The Asian Dynasties, Age of Empires IIIs second expansion. This {{was the first}} joint venture for both teams. The reason for them doing so was compatible schedules: Ensemble Studios was busy with other projects—particularly Halo Wars—while Big Huge Games' real-time strategy team had few projects at that time. Big Huge Games {{did most of the}} work, but Ensemble Studios designers Greg Street and Sandy Petersen <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brainstorming, and had control over the final product. Both studios had roles in testing the game before its release.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Monteux had {{felt that he}} should leave the SFSO. He had two main reasons: he {{believed}} that a conductor should not remain in one post for too long, and he wished {{to be free to}} accept more invitations to appear with other orchestras. He resigned from the SFSO {{at the end of the}} 1952 season. He briefly reappeared on the podium at the War Memorial Opera House within a year, as co-conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's coast-to-coast American tour, at Munch's invitation. Almost all the members of the SFSO were in the audience, and <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ovation given to their former chief.|$|E

5|$|From January–April 1955, Iowa made an {{extended}} cruise to the Mediterranean Sea as the flagship of the Commander, 6th Fleet. She departed on a midshipman training cruise on 1 June, and upon her return entered Norfolk for a four-month overhaul. Afterward, Iowa continued intermittent training cruises and operational exercises, until 4 January 1957 when she departed Norfolk for duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Upon completion, Iowa embarked midshipmen for a South American training cruise and <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> International Naval Review off Hampton Roads, Virginia on 13 June.|$|E
5|$|From here Alcibiades <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{siege of}} Byzantium along with Theramenes and Thrasyllus. A {{portion of the}} {{citizens}} of the city, demoralized and hungry, decided to surrender the city to Alcibiades for similar terms as the Selymbrians had received. On the designated night the defenders left their posts, and the Athenians attacked the Peloponnesian garrison in the city and their boats in the harbor. The portion of the citizenry that remained loyal to the Peloponnesians fought so savagely that Alcibiades issued a statement {{in the midst of the}} fighting which guaranteed their safety and this persuaded the remaining citizens to turn against the Peloponnesian garrison, which was nearly totally destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, OPEC {{lost its}} two newest members, who had <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-1970s. Ecuador withdrew in December 1992, {{because it was}} unwilling to pay the annual US$2million {{membership}} fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under the OPEC quota, although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. Iraq has remained a member of OPEC since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was {{not a part of}} OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's daunting political difficulties.|$|E
