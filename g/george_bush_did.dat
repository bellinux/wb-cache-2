I also was a little surprised about the stent since I remember that George Bush had been a regular avid runner during his presidency. He ran regular 8 -minute miles, which impressed me. I like to jog and am a couple of years younger than George Bush {{but there was no way}} that I could keep up his pace. Although I disagreed with most of his political policies, I could admire his personal dedication to exercise. It is always a bit of a shock to hear of someone who exercises regularly having heart troubles. So, why exercise? I know enough about atherosclerosis to know that it is an insidious disease often without symptoms. Most coronary atherosclerosis even when severely advanced often has few symptoms. It is often missed on routine screening treadmill stress tests and even with coronary angiography the extent of the disease can be underestimated. Also, there is a strong component of genetics in coronary atherosclerosis and it is definitely more common as we age. Is it inevitable if we live long enough? The news flash about <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> make me think more about the role of exercise in prevention and treatment of coronary atherosclerosis. How worthwhil...|$|E
40|$|Let us {{begin at}} the beginning: The presidential pardon power is plenary. If a good President uses it to clear the record of civil rights protesters, convicted years ago, let us say, of {{trespassing}} on federal land, neither the Congress nor the courts may sit in review. If a wicked President uses it to shield white supremacists from a courageous federal prosecutor, there is no recourse. If the President uses {{the power to make}} amends for the society 2 ̆ 7 s unwillingness to acknowledge religious differences, as President <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> on Christmas Eve of 1992, no entity but the public can bring him to brook; and if he uses it to prevent the prosecution of those who carried out a controversial and probably illegal policy, as President Bush also did on Christmas Eve of 1992, that is his right. In particular, there is nothing even constitutionally fishy in the President 2 ̆ 7 s use of the pardon power to frustrate the will of the other branches, or to limit their ability to inquire into executive affairs—as President Bush plainly did when he granted pardons to several of the major figures in the Iran-Contra scandal. To say that it cannot be used that way is as silly as saying that the Congress should not use its legislative power to criminalize policy disputes with the executive branch—the rather thin explanation that President Bush offered for his last-minute decision...|$|E
