40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that the way the world is con-ceptualized for {{language}} is language dependent and the result of negotiation between language users. This is investigated in a computer experiment in which a popu-lation of arti¯cial agents construct a shared language to talk about a world that can be conceptualized in multi-ple and possibly con°icting ways. It is argued that the establishment of a successful communication system re-quires that feedback about the communicative success is propagated to the ontological level, and thus that lan-guage shapes the way we conceptualize the world for communication. <b>Introduction</b> <b>and</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Question</b> Language and communication involve many aspects o...|$|E
40|$|<b>Introduction</b> <b>and</b> <b>research</b> <b>question</b> Health {{care systems}} are {{important}} elements of western European welfare states. Earlier research indicates that public health care has always been warmly welcomed {{and supported by the}} public, even in periods of retreat of the welfare state due to retrenchment policies. Using data from 1973, Ardig (1995) reviewed comparative evidence on the public opinion concerning health services in seven European countries and the United States. He found that citizens considered good medical care 'very important' and its provision an 'essential' responsibility of the government. Even though the welfare state was said to suffer from a legitimacy crisis from the mid- 70 's onwards; the results of the survey showed no traces of this crisis. Neither did the results of a profound trend-study on welfare attitudes by Coughlin (1980). Despite a considerable ambivalence among the public towards some programs, his findings clearly showed that some of the most expensiv...|$|E

40|$|To {{what extent}} can {{different}} forms of social capital help immigrants make headway on the labour market? An answer to this pressing question begins here. Taking the Netherlands and Germany as case studies, the book identifies two forms of social capital that may work to increase employment, income and occupational status and, conversely, decrease unemployment. New insights into the concepts of bonding and bridging arise through quantitative research methods, using longitudinal and cross-sectional data. Referring to a dense network with ‘thick’ trust, bonding is measured as family ties, coethnic ties and trust in the family. Bridging is seen in terms of inter-ethnic ties, thus implying a crosscutting network with ‘thin’ trust. Immigrant Performance in the Labour Market reveals that although bonding allows immigrants to get by, bridging enables them to get ahead.

This paper analyses how different coordinationmodes and different multiobjective decisionmaking approaches interfere {{with each other in}} hierarchical organizations. The investigation is based on an agent-based simulation. We apply a modified NK-model in which we map multiobjective decision making as adaptive walk on multiple performance landscapes, whereby each landscape represents one objective. We find that the impact of the coordination mode on the performance and the speed of performance improvement is critically affected by the selected multiobjective decision making approach. In certain setups, the performances achieved with the more complex multiobjective decision making approaches turn out to be less sensitive to the coordination mode than the performances achieved with the less complex multiobjective decision making approaches. Furthermore, we present results on the impact of the nature of interactions among decisions on the achieved performance in multiobjective setups. Our results give guidance on how to control the performance contribution of objectives to overall performance and answer the question how effective certain multiobjective decision making approaches perform under certain circumstances (coordination mode and interdependencies among decisions). 1. <b>Introduction</b> <b>and</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Question</b> During the last decades, changes in environmental condition...|$|E

40|$|<b>Introduction</b> <b>and</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Questions</b> The <b>research</b> area {{of urban}} {{simulation}} methods has grown notably in recent decades. Most {{of the research}} topics that concern urban simulation have concentrated on defining the complexities of urban environments with certain rules and algorithms. However, cities are getting more complex and changes to them are being made at greater speed. Therefore, current urban simulation modeling approaches based on rules and protocols are still struggling to reduce {{the gap between the}} virtual simulation environment and the real cities, since the behavior of citizens is frequently unpredictable and continuously adapting. In this context, research is necessary to develop more fundamental simulation methods that can handle these complexities and changes, leading to new design decision support systems. Therefore, this research was motivated with the following questions: What is the origin of the complexities and transformations of the urban environment? How can we approach the origin to deal with the urban complexities and transformations? To answer these questions, we hypothesize that the diverse human intentions are the origin of the issues that result from all of the complexities and changes of the cities. General Objectives As a result, we propose a participatory simulation environment that brings human intention into the urban simulator: a crowdsourcing [1] simulation platform that is operated by the people's participation. To achieve this crowdsourcing urban sustainability simulation environment, we must address the following research issues: categorization of urban sustainability indicators and technologies, inducing mass participations, and an implementation of social network services. Furthermore, we aim at using mobile computing devices, such as smart phones, as a terminal to the simulation environment. Fundamental Goals Our goal is to enable people to share urban information at any time and to compare each other's contributions through the crowdsourcing urban simulation platform. The information will be returned to the citizens to support their sustainability-aware life. The simulation platform also gives a chance not only to compare each other's levels of sustainability, but also to give self-satisfaction through an altruistic contribution for a sustainable future. Thus, people shall utilize the simulator in order to predict their individual or cities's future sustainability. Meanwhile, the user data will be collected and delivered to the central server in order to analyze the urban sustainability. Consequently, we can measure the urban sustainability based on a real human interaction, and compare individuals as well as cities. The whole process of this research is presented as a new paradigm of an urban simulator that reflects the urban complexities and the inconstant human mind changes. Specific Objectives of This Paper This paper will represent strategies of the crowdsourcing urban simulation which can make a paradigm shift of urban simulation and shall define the customized sustainable indicators for the initial steps of this research. It shows how as system for can communicate with the public using the current technologies: high performance mobile media, social network services and wide-area geospatial information systems. Furthermore, for the first step of this research, the paper defines the urban sustainability indicators, and their categorization is generalized and translated into simpler ways to support the citizen's intuitive understanding. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{presentation}} {{will demonstrate}} how the project ‘Foodprints’ was created from {{a platform of}} artistic <b>and</b> design-based <b>research</b> with empirical methods for data from unique urban-agro sites, multi-disciplinary input, quantitative analysis, literature, {{and the art of}} cooking in sensory design. The presentation demonstrates the project’s aspirations to instigate change on 3 levels: urban planning, design approaches and city inhabitant levels. It will also serve as an <b>introduction</b> <b>and</b> discourse into <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> currently explored in my doctoral. ‘Foodprints’ is a biologically-centered design and discussion toolkit for developing an urban food strategy amongst city designers, inhabitants and planners. The project applied concepts taken from biomimicry, systems thinking and scenario building to support development for new urban food models that could function mimicking the remarkable efficiencies found in nature. The toolkit produced a methodology to map the behavior of citizens, politics, architecture, logistics, food, farming and ecology within the urbanscape. It envisioned the city as a multi-organism, not as a fragmented site, and devised a catalyst to help navigate through the diversely complex issues surrounding urban agriculture and individual’s food relationships, creating a discussion platform for food, its stakeholders, urban metabolism, and opportunities towards a resilient future. Although ‘Foodprints’ was primarily aimed as a tool for developers, planners, architects and others in the built environment professions, it could also be used as an educational tool that could further be adopted in schooling, workshops, and everyday discourse about urban food logistics. Particular consideration was paid to urban planning policy for instigating ‘food strategies’ into policy-making as much as energy, water and waste have become. The project worked in collaboration with the Stockholm Resilience Centre in Sweden, KTH and FoAM to narrow down our catalyst framework typologies to 8 themes. The presentation will discuss each typology, docked also in its relevance to research on planetary boundaries and ecosystem services by the resilience centre. The methodology had strong foundations in artistic <b>and</b> design-based <b>research.</b> We explored whether and how to make these research typologies a serious consideration in built environment fields. We examined imaginative approaches to challenge urban planning mindsets by using diverse strategies both as inspiration and dissemination...|$|R
40|$|Maintaining {{balance is}} a task that healthy adult humans perform {{effortlessly}} throughout the day. However, when people age, or when they develop a neurological disease (e. g. Parkinson’s disease; PD) {{the risk of a}} fall increases, showing the complexities of maintaining balance. In this thesis, I investigated how both legs work together to maintain balance, both in healthy subjects and in people with PD. Chapter 1 provides a general <b>introduction</b> <b>and</b> introduces the <b>research</b> <b>questions.</b> Chapter 2 reviews {{the state of the art}} regarding gait <b>and</b> balance <b>research</b> in PD. It confirmed the high risk of falling in PD patients and it suggested that this could be due to asymmetries in motor performance, impaired integration of sensory signals and a difficulty of switching between sensory modalities. Chapter 3 describes a newly developed method to identify the balance control contribution of the hip and ankle joints of both legs separately, using closed‐loop system identification methods. Two separate mechanical perturbations were applied and the participants’ responses were determined with a dual forceplate and motion capture. The method was successfully applied in healthy subjects and a PD patient and showed that multisegmental balance control can be reliably identified using two independent perturbations. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 focused on the balance control contribution of each leg in PD patients. It was established that balance control can be asymmetrical in PD patients. However, it seemed that asymmetrical balance control was not related to clinical outcome measures such as freezing of gait. Interestingly, it was shown that PD patients can compensate for their most affected leg, by increasing the balance control contribution of the least affected leg. This could paradoxically increase the balance asymmetry. Chapter 7 investigated whether healthy subjects are capable to suppress erroneous sensory information of each leg separately. To this end, the balance of healthy volunteers was perturbed by rotating the support surface of each foot through the ankle joint axis. The results showed that subjects suppressed the sensory information of the most perturbed leg, independent of the other leg. Chapter 8 discusses the general findings of this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Expenditures on the {{salaries}} of public sector employees constitute a very important component of public expenditures, currently around CZK 200 billion annually in the Czech Republic. Adjusting the remuneration of employees in public administration (sector) is therefore an important option for increasing the efficiency of use of public funds. The assessment of {{the current system of}} public sector employee remuneration and a proposal for some specific changes to be made to it is the focus of this dissertation. The primary aim of my dissertation is to analyze the system of remuneration of employees of public and private sectors, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Within the primary target there is also a decomposition analysis, which indicates whether the employees are discriminated against in any of the sectors. The secondary objective is to make recommendations for the system of remunerating public sector employees of the in order to increase its efficiency in terms of public spending while maintaining its incentive function. The work is divided into five chapters. The first chapter, entitled "Theoretical Foundations," provides an overview of the relevant literature, the fundamental basis in economic theory, and issues of the Mincer wage equation, which is then later used as the basis for regression and decomposition analyses, and mainly describes in detail the decomposition method that is used to explain the difference in the salary level in the private and the public sector. These decomposition methods represent, together with quantile regression, the main tool used to meet the objectives of this work. The second chapter, entitled "The Remuneration of Public Sector Employees," describes the structure of the remuneration of employees of the public sector. The data shows that the current system produces results in the form of salaries that do not correspond to the market. The third chapter, called "Regression Model," builds on the analysis performed on data from QSAE, which was discussed {{in the second part of}} the previous chapter, and its purpose is to prepare the documents for verification and deepen their conclusions. The fourth chapter, called "Regression and Decomposition Analysis," is based on the regression model assembled in the previous chapter, and describes the results of the regression decomposition analysis performed on the described sample data. This chapter verifies the hypotheses set out in the <b>introduction</b> <b>and</b> answers <b>research</b> <b>questions.</b> The fifth <b>and</b> final chapter, entitled "Interpretation of the Results and Recommendations," focuses on the interpretation of the results, the proposed regulation of remuneration, and recommendations for further research. The main finding of this work is that the system of remuneration of public sector workers is set so that, while the overall average brings quite comparable results in terms of the salary as the entire labor market, it is not throughout the distribution. The performed regression analysis showed that both the public and private sectors evaluate the same things differently (different values of the regression coefficients of variables), and both at the average and along the entire distribution. We can say that the mechanism of the remuneration of employees of the public sector is different from that of the market. This fact is confirmed by the significantly higher coefficient of determination of the regression model of the public sector. Regarding possible discrimination in wages, the analysis showed that employees in the public sector may in contrary to the preposition of positive discrimination be positively discriminated against only up to approximately fifteenth percentile. From fifteenth percentile they are discriminated against negatively. This was confirmed by the decomposition analysis performed on the average salaries, which indicates that public sector employees are, at this level, negatively discriminated against (if the public sector employees have the same regression coefficients as private sector employees, their earnings increase). Finally, this conclusion is confirmed by the dummy variable, which represents belonging to the private sector when the value of its corresponding regression coefficients, in quantile regression analysis along the distribution, evolves from negative to positive and is significantly increasing. The thesis also shows how the system of remunerating public sector employees can be adjusted to reward employees in a way that is comparable with the market...|$|R
