25|$|The northwestern wine {{regions are}} {{particularly}} prone {{to the effects}} of the hurricane force winds known as the Zonda which blows from the Andes during the flowering period of early summer. This fierce wind of hot, dry air can disrupt the flowering process and severely reduce potential yields. Most of the growing season is dry with the lack of humidity limiting the risk and hazard from various grape diseases and <b>fungal</b> <b>rot.</b> Many vineyards operate without the need for any chemical spraying, a condition conducive to organic viticulture. The periodic occurrence of the El Niño phenomenon can have a sharp influence on climate condition during a growing season-such as the case during the 1998 vintage when prolong heavy rains brought by El Niño led to widespread rot and fungal disease.|$|E
25|$|Emmer wheat (triticum dicoccum) was {{initially}} {{the most widespread}} variety of wheat, as it grew well in the warm climate and was resistant to <b>fungal</b> <b>rot.</b> It was high yielding, with large grains and relatively high amounts of gluten, and bread made from emmer wheat flour was thus fairly light in texture. However, emmer required time-consuming pounding or roasting to remove its husk, and during the Iron Age, durum wheat (triticum durum), a descendent of emmer, gradually replaced emmer and became the favored grain for making fine flour. Durum grew well in the rich soil of the larger valleys of the central and northern areas of the country, where rainfall exceeded 225 millimeters per year, was higher yielding than emmer, and its grains released more easily from the chaff. It could therefore {{be separated from the}} husk without roasting or pounding first, thus reducing the work required for threshing, and also leaving most of the grains whole, which was better for longer storage.|$|E
25|$|Woodpeckers {{use their}} chisel-like bills to {{excavate}} their cavity nests, {{a process which}} takes, on average, about two weeks. Cavities are normally excavated on the downward-facing side of a branch, presumably {{to make it more}} difficult for predators to access the nest, and to reduce the chance that rain floods the nest. There is also some evidence that <b>fungal</b> <b>rot</b> may make the wood on the underside of leaning trunks and branches easier to excavate. Most woodpeckers use a cavity for only a single year. The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker is an exception; it takes far longer—up to two years—to excavate its nest cavity, and may reuse it for more than two decades. The typical woodpecker nest has a short horizontal tunnel which leads to a vertical chamber within the trunk. The size and shape of the chamber depends on species, and the entrance hole is typically only as large as is needed to allow access for the adult birds. While wood chips are removed during the excavation process, most species line the floor of the cavity with a fresh bed of them before laying their eggs.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Although its {{importance}} as vegetable, {{a considerable amount}} of onion bulbs is lost in storage. That's why storage condition {{is one of the most}} important issues to maintain post-harvest quality. For this purpose, a factorial experiment based on randomized complete block design with two factors and three replicates was carried out. The factors were storage conditions of onion bulbs with five levels (4 oC in the seed storage apparatus, 25 and 30 oC without using rosemary leaves and branches in the incubator, and 25 and 30 oC using rosemary leaves and branches in the incubator) and storage times with ten levels (10 consecutive weeks). The storage feedbacks of bulbs in terms of the weight loss (WL) and the average bud length (ABL) of bulbs were analyzed. The storage of bulbs at 25 oC using rosemary fresh leaves and branches inside each bag of bulbs after 10 weeks resulted in the lowest weight loss and average bud length, and significantly controlled the post-harvest <b>fungal</b> <b>rotting</b> and improved the shelf life of bulbs. The findings of this study indicated the high potential of rosemary fresh leaves and branches, which can be considered as an alternative strategy to control post-harvest <b>fungal</b> <b>rotting</b> and to improve the storage life of bulbs considering its simplicity and efficacy in decreasing the storage cost, the weight loss and sprouting without causing any environmental toxicity...|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{potential}} for some crop weeds {{to be used as}} a food source, many can also prove harmful to crops, both directly and indirectly. Crop weeds can inhibit the growth of crops, contaminate harvested crops and often spread rapidly. They can also host crop pests such as aphids, <b>fungal</b> <b>rots</b> and viruses. Cost increases and yield losses occur as a result. Striga, one of the main cereal crop weeds in Sub-Saharan Africa, commonly causes yield losses of 40-100% and accounts for around $7 billion in losses annually. Around 100 million hectares of land in Sub-Saharan Africa are affected by striga. Barnyard grass has been identified as a culprit in global rice yield losses and certain species have been known to mimic rice.|$|R

40|$|Queensland {{fruit fly}} (Bactrocera tryoni) {{is a major}} orchard pest in Australia. Adult flies lay their eggs into ripe fruit, {{resulting}} in larval infestation {{and the spread of}} bacterial and <b>fungal</b> <b>rots.</b> The role of these microbes in fruit fly ecology is only now being elucidated, with much of the emphasis to date focusing on bacterial communities. In our study, we explored the diversity of yeast species associated with B. tryoni adults and larvae. We found larvae were highly associated with budding yeasts of the genera Hanseniaspora and Pichia across several fruit species. In feeding trials using two yeast species, one species was highly beneficial to larval development and survival whilst the other provided no nutritional benefit. Moreover, adult flies were deterred by the odours produced by the beneficial yeast. Although these findings appear counter-intuitive we discuss how they fit with our understanding of the ecology of this insect, and how this new knowledge could lead to improved monitoring and control of fruit flies in Australia...|$|R

Lumber samples from ethylene treated rubberwood (TRW) and from untreated rubberwood (URW) were compared mainly for their resistance to fungi, {{differences in the}} chemical composition between TRW and URW, and the antifungal activities of their aqueous extracts. The TRW had significantly higher lignin and extractives contents than the URW, but the TRW had comparatively poor resistance to <b>fungal</b> <b>rotting.</b> The white rot fungus Ganoderma lucidum and the brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum striantum caused in vitro significantly higher mass loss in TRW than in URW.

The aqueous wood extracts strongly inhibited growth of G. lucidum, with lesser effects on the other fungi tested. Caffeine was detected in the TRW, but not the URW.

The efficacy of the best timing of insecticide application to control fumonisin contamination was on average 93 %, compared to the untreated control. Contamination levels of these mycotoxins increased moving to either an earlier or later treatment; furthermore an earlier insecticide application showed lower fumonisin contamination than a treatment applied after the adult flight peak. The production of maize kernels and maize-based foods that do not exceed the maximum international and EU permitted levels for fumonisins could be enhanced by an appropriate insecticide treatment against the second generation ECB.

Rot fungi have been shown to infect fruit in the orchard throughout the season, become la-tent, then resume growth as the fruit begin to ripen postharvest and antifungal chemicals in the skin begin to break down (Prusky et al., 1983). Infection may also take place at flower-ing, and probably at harvest (Everett et al., 1999). Infection in the packing line is also pos-sible.

This is to maintain a constant and additive improvement to the quality of the avocado fruit, small increments that together result in a large improvement in quality.
