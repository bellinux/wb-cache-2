R.adusta, found with conifers, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> less acrid taste, and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} extent to which the {{educational}} attainments of a generation are reproduced in Great Britain. We address a very specific question [...] what was the effect, among people born around the middle of the 20 th century, of <b>having</b> acquired <b>a</b> University degree on the probability of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> child who also acquires a degree? We consider the two central processes involved: the effect of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> degree on whether or not <b>a</b> person <b>had</b> <b>a</b> child and, conditional on having at least one child, the effect of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> degree on whether at least one child acquired a degree. We find a strong and persistent negative effect of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> degree on the chances of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> child but, among those who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> child, the possession of <b>a</b> degree <b>had</b> <b>a</b> large positive effect on the probability of that child also acquiring a degree. These two effects largely cancel out and thus <b>having</b> <b>a</b> degree <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very small effect on the chances of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> child who also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> degree. One major advantage of adopting the prospective approach used here is that it helps to better answer questions concerning the intergenerational effects of changes in education...|$|R
