5000|$|The Scottish <b>demersal</b> <b>fleet</b> {{has been}} facing {{economically}} difficult times {{for several years}} due to the decline of cod and haddock in the North Sea, which were the mainstay of catches. The fleet has declined from around 800 vessels in 1992 to just over 400 in 2004. This sector catches a diverse range of species and, although cod and haddock are important components, togetheraccounting for 40% of the total landings, in absolute value they represent only a modest turnover of £55m. Commercial performance of the sector {{has been dominated by}} the difficulties over cod, particularly in recent years with the implementation of the European [...] "Cod Recovery Plan", but have also been affected by a scarcity of haddock and other demersal species. In recent years much of the demersal industry has been supported by the abundant 1999 year-class of haddock.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a data envelopment model is {{presented}} to evaluate short term investment decisions in the Dutch beam trawl and <b>demersal</b> <b>fleet.</b> We investigated how short run profit drives investment decisions and how a data envelopment analysis {{can be used to}} show what the optimal level of capital use is and how investment in variable and fixed inputs can optimize the output of the sector. The degree of capital utilization {{can be seen as a}} measure of whether firms should invest or disinvest in their capital assets. Capital utilization also measures to which extent idle and excess capacity is present in a firm. Differences in capital utilization mainly depend on the degree in which a firm can adjust fixed capital in the short run. It therefore should be a key economic parameter to evaluate the performance of a sector. We measured the physical capital utilization for the Dutch beam trawl and <b>demersal</b> <b>fleet</b> for 2005 and decomposed the capacity utilization into technical efficiency, economic capital utilization and optimal capacity idleness. Furthermore we illustrated how the economic capacity measure can be used to predict investment decisions in the fleet. Results show that economic capital utilization inefficiency is on average 13 %, which indicates that landings could have been 13 % higher then they were if the fleet operated 100 % efficiently. About 1 % of the capacity utilization inefficiency is caused by idle/excess capacity. This very low percentage indicates that there are few indivisibilities in the input for the Dutch beam trawl and <b>demersal</b> <b>fleet.</b> Based on short term profit maximization it is clear that it is optimal to make as much use of the available capital as possible. The remaining 12 % can be attributed to economic capacity inefficiency and technical inefficiency in the fleet. Vessels with a low capital utilization are more likely to disinvest than vessels with a high capital utilization. Vessels with a capital utilization that is higher than unity almost always will choose to invest...|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the extent to which area-based management may have influenced the fishing efficiency of the Danish and Dutch <b>demersal</b> <b>fleets</b> harvesting cod, plaice and sole in the North Sea. Special consideration is given to the `plaice box', a restricted area where fishing is prohibited to towed-gear fleets of horsepower exceeding 300 hp. An index of fishing power is calculated as the log-ratio between the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of any vessel and some survey abundance index. Annual trends in fishing are calculated as the year-effect derived from a general linear model (GLM) analysis of the index of fishing power. The fishing efficiency of Danish gill-netters and, to some extent, Danish seiners, has overall increased inside the `plaice box', whilst remaining relatively stable outside. However, the fishing efficiency of the other exemption fleets has apparently been subject to little change. Overall, it is not possible to determine the extent to which the `plaice box' has contributed to the fishing efficiency dynamics of the exemption fleets. However, some of the results of this study bear out the conclusions from recent investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{aggregate}} extraction intensity and the distance to extraction sites {{on the distribution of}} fishing effort were investigated for a broad selection of French and English <b>demersal</b> <b>fleets</b> operating in the Eastern English Channel. The most prominent result was that most fleets fishing near to aggregate extraction sites were not deterred by extraction activities. The fishing effort of dredgers and potters could be greater adjacent to marine aggregates sites than elsewhere, and also positively correlated to extraction intensity with a lag of 0 – 9 months. The distribution of fishing effort of French netters remained consistent over the study period. However, it is of note that the fishing effort of netters has increased substantially in the impacted area of the Dieppe site (where it is correlated to extraction intensity with a lag of 6 months), while slightly deceasing in the intermediate and reference areas. The attraction of fishing fleets is likely due to a local temporary concentration of their main target species. However, knowledge of their life-history characteristics and habitat preferences suggests that some of these species could be particularly vulnerable to aggregate extractions in the longer term...|$|R

40|$|Discards {{represent}} one of {{the most}} important issues within current commercial fishing. It occurs for a range of reasons and is influenced by an even more complex array of factors. We address this issue by examining the data collected within the Danish discard observer program and describe the factors that influence discarding within the Danish Kattegat <b>demersal</b> <b>fleet</b> over the period 1997 to 2008. Generalised additive models were used to assess how discards of the 3 main target species, Norway lobster, cod and plaice, and their subcomponents (under and over minimum landings size) are influenced by important factors and their potential relevance to management. Our results show that discards are influenced by a range of different factors that are different for each species and portion of discards. We argue that knowledge about the factors influential to discarding and their use in relation to potential mitigation measures are essential for future fisherie...|$|E
40|$|A {{reduction}} of unwanted catches {{is a key}} element of the Common Fisheries Policy reform proposal (EC, 2010). To achieve this, a landing obligation (or discard ban) will be introduced, prohibiting the at-sea disposal of quota-regulated species. Instead these catches shall be brought back to shore and counted against a quota, where applicable. In 2014, upon request by the ministry, more clarity was sought on how catch quotas could be calculated and what they would look like for the most relevant fish species of the Dutch demersal fishery. The report of that study (Miller et al. 2014) provided an overview of total allowable catch allocations (TAC), national quota, landings and discards statistics for some of the most-relevant quota-regulated species caught by the Dutch <b>demersal</b> <b>fleet.</b> A number of scenarios of how the new catch quotas could be calculated were presented. The theoretical implications of these alternative scenarios for the Dutch fleet were described under the assumption of no change in relative stability. In 2015, the Ministry of Economic Affairs requested an update of Miller et al. (2014), and this report is the result of that update...|$|E
40|$|The landing {{obligation}} policy {{was one of}} the major innovations introduced in the last Common Fisheries Policy reform in Europe. It is foreseen that the policy will affect the use of fishing opportunities and hence the economic performance of the fleets. The problem with fishing opportunities could be solved if single-stock total allowable catches (TACs) could be achieved simultaneously for all the stocks. In this study, we evaluate the economic impact of the {{landing obligation}} policy on the Spanish <b>demersal</b> <b>fleet</b> operating in the Iberian Sea region. To generate TAC advice, we used two sets of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) reference points, the single-stock MSY reference points defined by ICES and a set of multistock reference points calculated simultaneously using a bioeconomic optimization model. We found that the impact of the landing obligation is time and fleet dependent and highly influenced by assumptions about fleet dynamics. At fishery level, multistock reference points mitigate the decrease in the net present value generated by the implementation of the landing obligation. However at fleet level, the effect depends on the fleet itself and the period. To ensure the optimum use of fishing opportunities, the landing obligation should be accompanied by a management system that guarantees consistency between single-stock TACs. In this regard, multistock reference points represent an improvement over those currently in use. However, further investigation is necessary to enhance performance both at fleet level and in the long term. Versión del edito...|$|E

This report uses the method presented in Chapter 5 of Effects of seabed protection on the Frisian Front and Central Oyster Grounds (Van Oostenbrugge et al. 2015) to update the reports already published by Wageningen Economic Research on fishing activity on the proposed closed areas on the Central Oyster Grounds and Frisian Front (Oostenbrugge, Bartelings et al. 2013, Oostenbrugge and Hamon 2014, van Oostenbrugge and Hamon 2014, Oostenbrugge, Turenhout et al. 2016, Oostenbrugge, Turenhout et al. 2016). The effort, value and landings by the Dutch, British, Danish, German, Belgian, Swedish and French fishing fleets are presented for a five-year period (2010 - 2015) and show variations over the last years without a clear trend. Value of landings and gross value added of the Dutch, British and Belgian fleets have been fluctuating over the past years but there was a clear upward trend for Danish and German fleets. Sweden and France have not been active in the area over the 2010 - 2015 period.

40|$|The South African horse {{mackerel}} (Trachurus trachurus capensis) fishery began in 1950. It currently {{consists of a}} demersal/midwater trawl fleet (concentrated on the South coast) and a pelagic purse-seine fishery (concentrated on the West Coast). Adult {{horse mackerel}} are taken as a by-catch by the <b>demersal</b> trawl <b>fleet</b> and as a targeted catch by the midwater trawl fleet. Juvenile horse mackerel are taken as a by-catch by the pelagic purseseine fleet. Previous stock assessments for this fishery include a surplus production model (Punt 1989, 1992), and a Beverton-Holt yield-per-recruit approach (Butterworth and Raubenheimer 1992; Butterworth and Clarke 1996).

40|$|Evaluations of {{the effects}} of {{management}} measures on fish populations are usually based on the analyses of population dynamics and estimates of fishing mortality from stock assessments. However, this approach may not be applicable in all cases, in particular for data limited stocks, which may suffer from uncertain catch information and consequently lack reliable estimates of fishing mortality. In this study we develop an approach to obtain proxies for changes in fishing mortality based on effort information and predicted stock distribution. Cod in the Kattegat is used as an example. We use GAM analyses to predict local cod densities and combine this with spatio-temporal data of fishing effort based on VMS (Vessel Monitoring System). To quantify local fishing impact on the stock, retention probability of the gears is taken into account. The results indicate a substantial decline in the impact of Danish <b>demersal</b> trawl <b>fleet</b> on cod in the Kattegat in recent years, due to a combination of closed areas, introduction of selective gears and changes in overall effort...|$|R
40|$|Two {{species of}} megrim occur in Irish waters but Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis {{constitutes}} {{the bulk of}} the catch by the Irish <b>demersal</b> <b>fleet.</b> Megrim is exploited as a by-catch of gadoid fisheries and is particularly associated with fisheries for Nephrops, angler and ray. Over the past 25 years megrim landings from the ICES divisions adjoining Ireland have fluctuated between 6, 000 and 21, 000 tonnes but there has been a gradual upward trend of which Ireland has taken an increasing share, rising to 1, 800 tonnes in 1980. Spain exerts most influence in this fishery, being the location of the main market for megrim as well as having the greatest catching power. The most significant developments in the exploitation of megrim over the past twenty years are identified as the establishment of the European Exclusive Fishery Zone in 1977 and the entry of Spain to the Community in 1986. The importance of division Vlla as a producer of megrim has declined and the main fisheries for the species are in divisions VlIg-k. This assessment of the species is based on material gathered in 1989 and 1990 when length frequency data from the landings were collected from the west and south coasts. Lengths of approximately 8, 000 megrim from landings from all divisions were collected in 1989, 28, 000 the following year, and 1, 400 were aged in the two years. Samples of the landings are comparable with graded exports from the fleet. The most intensive work was undertaken on a Nephrops and mixed whitefish fishery in Vllj. Megrim discards (round) are estimated to weigh 13. 2 % of landings (gutted). Few megrim of less than 20 cm were captured and no 0 group megrim was encountered. A growth curve is calculated for females and for females and males combined. For males the to value is outside the range of that parameter recorded elsewhere. Males are however a small proportion of the total, their higher mortality and slower growth giving them a skewed frequency distribution and reducing their contribution to the landings. Catch curves provided values for Z of 0. 45 and 0. 49 for females and combined sexes. Yield per recruit curves indicate exploitation is close to F max for females and on the negative slope for the sexes combined...|$|E

This report uses the method presented in Chapter 5 of ‘Effects of seabed protection on the Frisian Front and Central Oyster Grounds’ (Van Oostenbrugge et al. 2015) to update the reports already published by Wageningen Economic Research on fishing activity on the proposed closed areas on the Cleaver Bank and Frisian Front (Hamon et al. 2013; Oostenbrugge and Hamon 2014). The effort, value and landings by the Dutch, British, Danish, German, Belgian, Swedish and French fishing fleets are presented for a five year period (2010 - 2015) and show variations over the last years but generally show a decline in effort in both areas. Value of landings and gross value added show an upward trend for the Dutch fishery in the Cleaver Bank (with a low point in 2013) but a downward trend for the British, German and Belgian fleets and for the Frisian Front. Main target species of the Cleaver Bank are plaice, targeted by the beam trawl fleet, followed by mackerel, cod and whiting {{in the rest of the}} <b>demersal</b> <b>fleet.</b> On the Frisian Front, gillnets target mainly sole and cod. The total value of landings has remained relatively stable on the Cleaver Bank between € 1. 6 m and € 2 m over years (with the exception of the low 2013 value at € 0. 7 m) while it remained low for the Frisian Front around € 17, 000 per year on average for the fleets from the countries considered. Within fleets, the dependency of individuals on the areas to be closed can greatly vary although the value of landings in the proposed closures represent less than 1 % of the total value of landings for the Dutch fleet.

40|$|Background: This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} subsidies on the profitability and ecological stability of the North Sea fisheries over the past 20 years. It shows the negative impact that subsidies can have on both the biomass of important fish species and the possible profit from fisheries. The study includes subsidies in an ecosystem model of the North Sea and examines the possible effects of eliminating fishery subsidies. Methodology/Principal Findings: Hindcast analysis between 1991 and 2003 indicates that subsidies reduced the profitability of the fishery even though gross revenue might have been high for specific fisheries sectors. Simulations seeking to maximise the total revenue between 2004 and 2010 suggest {{that this can be}} achieved by increasing the effort of Nephrops trawlers, beam trawlers, and the pelagic trawl-and-seine fleet, while reducing the effort of demersal trawlers. Simulations show that ecological stability can be realised by reducing the effort of the beam trawlers, Nephrops trawlers, pelagic- and <b>demersal</b> trawl-and-seine <b>fleets.</b> This analysis also shows that when subsidies are included, effort will always be higher for all fleets, because it effectively reduces the cost of fishing. Conclusions/Significance: The study found that while removing subsidies might reduce the total catch and revenue, it increases the overall profitability of the fishery and the total biomass of commercially important species. For example, cod, haddock, herring and plaice biomass increased over the simulation when optimising for profit, and when optimising fo...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a global}} {{comparative}} study of user-participation in fisheries management, a neo-institutional economic framework analysis {{is applied to the}} South African Deep-Sea Hake Fishery to evaluate past and present co-management arrangements. It is postulated that the comprehensive partnerships that exist will struggle to remain legitimate and “functional” during major changes in the access rights regime. The government is re-distributing quota to new entrants and “previously disadvantaged ” South Africans, resulting in competition between the established <b>demersal</b> trawl <b>fleet</b> and a new longline sector for access rights. The established industry is currently undertaking re-structuring via investment schemes, joint ventures and share agreements. The relationship between “rights to resource ” and “user-participation in management ” is one where, due to uncertainty, the participants are investing in negotiating security of tenure rather than in co-management arrangements. The current re-structuring and institutional changes are thus impacting on the extensive interaction that existed in the past between the industry and the government. Over the last two decades, extensive government-industry commitments to rebuilding, has reversed the declining trends in CPUE observed in the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s, and the hake stock off the west coast of South Africa is now managed at sustainable levels. The challenge in the future is for the government to engage in co-management arrangements, which replicate the successful agreements of the past with all the stakeholders; that is, both the established industry and the new participants.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this report is to present the science {{developed}} within the VECTORS project to improve {{the understanding of the}} key processes driving the behaviour of human agents utilising a variety of EU maritime domains. While particular {{attention has been paid to}} the spatial interactions between fishing activities and other human uses (e. g., maritime traffic, offshore wind parks, aggregate extractions), the behaviour of non-fishing sectors of activity has also been considered. Various quantitative and semi-qualitative approaches have been pursued to gain better insight into behavioural drivers based on past data, and also forecast how human agents would react if access was constrained by either management (e. g. Marine Protected Areas – MPA), or the installation of a new operator. This report covers the North Sea and Eastern Channel, and also one area of the Baltic Sea: the Gdansk Bay. Fine-scale catch and effort data by fishing vessel, fishing trip, gear used and ICES rectangle visited have been made available for the French, Dutch, English and German fleets. The VECTORS WP 2. 3 team has also collected data from the non-fishing sectors of activity, in particular, aggregate extractions and maritime traffic. The objective of collecting data for non-fishing sectors is to produce a Spatial Overlap Metric measuring the constraint exerted by other sectors of activity on fishing. Comprehensive aggregate extraction and shipping intensity metrics could then be derived dynamically at a fine spatial and temporal resolution. For the other sectors potentially competing for space with fishing (e. g., wind farms, oil/gas extractions, aquaculture), and also for protected areas, a static overlap metric has been set to the surface occupied by the plant or area protected. In order to apply common methodologies and codes across different case studies, whilst abiding by confidentiality issues around these data, it has been decided to develop a common exchange format to collate the data used in subsequent analyses; five tables have then been produced. Two complementary types of approaches have been carried out to analyse and/or model the mechanisms of human behaviour, which are hereby referred to as quantitative and qualitative research. Quantitative research consisted of analysing fishing decision-making processes based on existing data and then making forecasts building on scenarios, while qualitative research consisted of interviewing stakeholders from different sectors of activity to get their views on both their past and likely future behaviour. Different methodological approaches have been pursued by different institutes, and these were applied to several case studies wherever possible. Modelling the current and past dynamics of fishing vessels: The understanding of the dynamics of fishing vessels is of great interest to define sustainable fishing strategies and to characterize the spatial distribution of the fishing effort. It is also a prerequisite to anticipate changes in fishermen’s strategy in reaction to management rules, the economic context or the evolution of exploited resources. In this context, analysis of individual vessel's trajectories offers promising perspectives to describe behaviour during fishing trips. A hidden Markov model with two behavioural states (steaming and fishing) was developed to infer the sequence of non-observed fishing vessel behaviour along the vessels' trajectory based on GPS records. Conditionally to the behaviour, vessels movements were modelled by a discrete time solution of a (continuous time) stochastic differential equation on vectorial speeds. The model's parameters and the sequence of hidden behavioural states were estimated using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, coupled with the Viterbi algorithm that captures the most credible joint sequence of hidden states. A simulation approach was performed, that outlined the importance of contrast between the model’s parameters as well as the influence of path length to allow good estimation performances. The model was then fitted to four original GPS tracks recorded with a time step of 15 minutes derived from voluntary fishing vessels operating in the Channel within the IFREMER's RECOPESCA project. Results showed differences in parameter estimation depending on the gear used, on both the speeds during fishing operations and the Markovian transitions between behaviours. Results also suggested the benefits of future inclusion of variables such as tidal currents within the ecosystem approach of fisheries. Hidden Markov models are well suited to describe jointly fishing boat movement and associated fishing activities. They allow us to estimate the sequence of activities (i. e. fishing, travelling) along a trajectory, as well as the movement parameters (speed, turning angle) associated with each activity. Normally, these models are developed to characterize the spatial dynamics of fishing vessels that belong to a specific fishery with a given métier. However, because of the large variability that exists in fishing practices, some adaptations in the modelling structure are needed when the spatial dynamics of one or several fishing fleets present a mixture of métiers with distinct traits of movement and trajectory. A procedure was developed to capture the variability of fishing practices and associated vessel trajectories. Fishing trips were characterized by their métiers, which were identified for each gear by clustering landing profiles (in value). Fishing boat trajectories were described using movement parameters (speed, acceleration, turning angles, straightness) estimated from GPS positions recorded along the tracks. A principal component analysis was performed to provide a detailed description of the different trajectory patterns in relation with fishing trip specificities (i. e. vessel, gear, métier). Hidden Markov models were then fitted for some selected fishing trips. Two types of models were considered. The basic one was a 2 states model with behavioural activities corresponding to fishing and traveling. The second one presented a number of fishing states depending on the number of métiers identified for the trip. Fitting performance was compared based on DIC and estimated confidence intervals for the parameters. This procedure was applied to a set of volunteer vessels participating in the RECOPESCA project from IFREMER in the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel for years 2011 - 2012. We show that fishing trip activities, such as métiers, were structuring variables for trajectories, which helped to specify properly hidden Markov models. Discrete choice models building in a random utility function (RUMs) have also been used to aid understanding and modelling of fleet dynamics and to anticipate how fishing effort is re-allocated following any permanent or seasonal closure of fishing grounds, given the competition for space with other active maritime sectors. A first Random Utility Model (RUM) was developed and initially applied to determine how fishing effort is allocated spatially and temporally by the French demersal mixed fleet fishing in the Eastern English Channel. The spatial resolution of this investigation was that of an ICES rectangle (30 ’ x 60 ’). The explanatory variables chosen were past effort i. e. experience or habit, previous catch to represent previous success, % of area occupied by spatial regulation, and by other competing maritime sectors. Results showed that fishers tended to adhere to past annual fishing practices, except for the fleet targeting molluscs which exhibited within year behaviour influenced by seasonality. Furthermore, results indicated generally that maritime traffic may impact negatively on fishing decision. Finally, the model was validated by comparing predicted re-allocation of effort against observed effort, for which there was a close correlation. The method was also applied to the Dutch beam trawl fleet (2008 - 2010). The Dutch fleets’ activity was well captured by the model which included only biological and economic drivers. Predictions were accurate and followed the seasonal patterns well. To predict the long term changes in fishing activity additional factors, such as the competition for space with other marine users, should be included and changes in fish distribution should be linked to the current model. A second Random Utility Model (RUM) was developed using a finer spatial resolution (15 ’ x 15 ’) and initially applied to analyse the determinants of English and Welsh scallop-dredging fleet behaviour, including competing sectors operating in the eastern English Channel. Results show that aggregate activity, maritime traffic, expected costs, English inshore 6 and French sovereign 12 mile nautical limits negatively impact the choice of fishers, and conversely that past success, expected revenues and fishing within the 12 nautical mile limit have a positive effect on their utility. The model has potential application for Marine Spatial Planning (MSP). This RUM was also used to evaluate the interactions of fishing effort allocation and shipping for the Dutch <b>demersal</b> <b>fleet</b> fishing in the English Channel, this analysis of the French and UK fleets was also undertaken for Dutch seiners operating in the Eastern Channel. The parameters associated with the gross revenue all had positive parameter estimates for the means, as is expected from fishers seeking to maximise net revenues. The parameters associated with costs were also positive, which is striking, given that one would expect a cost minimization. The positive estimates could be caused by the trips to Dutch harbours that are in the data set. The closed area parameters are both negative, reflecting the fact that fishing is not allowed in these areas. The parameters associated with the shipping lanes had negative estimates, as in the French and English case, but these estimates did not differ significantly from zero. Other spatially-explicit statistical analyses have been conducted to evaluate, separately, the impacts of aggregate extraction and maritime traffic. In terms of marine aggregate extractions, the effects were investigated of both aggregate extraction intensity and the proximity to dredging sites on the distribution of fishing effort, for a broad selection of French and English demersal fleets operating in the Eastern Channel. The most striking result was that for most of the fishing fleets and aggregate extraction sites, neither dredging intensity, nor the proximity to the extraction site, had a deterring effect on fishing activities. To the contrary, the fishing effort of dredgers and potters could be larger in the vicinity of marine aggregates sites than in their neighbourhood and also positively correlated to extraction intensity with a lag of 0 to 6 months. The fishing effort distribution of French netters was overall space-invariant over the whole time period under investigation. However, it is important to note that the fishing effort of netters has increased substantially in the impacted area of the Dieppe site (where it is correlated to dredging intensity with a lag of 6 months), whilst remaining almost constant in the intermediate and reference areas. The attraction of fishing fleets is likely due to a local and temporary concentration of their main target species. However, knowledge on the vulnerability and life-history characteristics of these species to aggregate extractions suggests that over-extending the licensed areas would be detrimental to them and to their related fisheries in the longer term. In relation to maritime traffic, we investigated whether fishermen’s effort and catch information could be used to inform on species distributions and if the observed effort (and catches) could be constrained by other activities, such as maritime traffic. In this first attempt to correlate fish distribution observed during a scientific survey and fishing catches via linkage of VMS and logbooks data there was a good correlation between the observed biomass in October by a scientific survey and fishing location targeting the different demersal species in the Eastern Channel. Fleets seem attracted by areas identified to have high abundance densities. For most of the species, maritime traffic seems to be a perturbation for the fishing activities. However, in the case of the red mullet fishery, vessels seem to avoid traffic lanes except when they expect high fish densities. They then may take the risk of fishing inside the traffic lanes or in areas of high marine traffic densities. Eliciting the perspectives of fishers: To validate the outcomes of fleet dynamics models a survey was undertaken of French and Dutch fishers operating in the Eastern Channel and in the German Bight. In the Eastern Channel, French fishers did not feel constrained in the amount of space they had available for fishing. The one who did, cited Natura 2000 and shipping lanes as constraining factors, and said this directly influenced his fishing patterns. Four agreed that they conflicted at times with other fishers (all Dutch purse seiners) over space while one mentioned conflicts with coast guards. One also cited aggregate extraction (when completed) as resulting in no fishing anymore in that area. In the German Bight, Dutch fishers considered that their fishing ground in the German Bight shrank in the past 10 years. They have to fish more intensively now on less available fishing grounds. They have to face sometimes unsafe situations near oil rigs and wind farms. Finally, fishers do not think they have any influence on the increase of competition for space but would like to have more. Closed areas (including real time closures), wind farms and Natura 2000 areas have restricted their activities spatially as well as, to a lesser degree, oil rigs, shipping, and mussel cultures. -German Bight Dutch fishers earn less and catch less targeted species. They have to adapt their fishing pattern. It is crowded now and less safe. Fishers expect more large-area restrictions of a permanent character in the near future in the German Bight but will continue fishing since they feel they have no choice. Interviews were also conducted with representatives of the main sectors of activity (including fishing but also non-fishing sectors) in the Eastern Channel, the Dogger Bank and the Gdansk Bay. The pressure on spatial usage of European regional seas by various stakeholder groups is intense. In all case study sites, the majority of stakeholders feel this pressure will only increase in the future, primarily due to proposals and plans for offshore wind farms, the newest entrants to these busy seas. In some case study areas, such as the eastern English Channel and Dogger Bank, applications have already been approved with construction planned; in the German Bight wind farms already exist and at least in the Dutch part new proposals have been made. In others, such as the Gulf of Gdansk, such developments are further away, and unlikely to happen soon due to legal constraints, yet the uncertainty of impacts, such as on fishing, is a cause of great concern. Of all the stakeholder groups, the fisheries group was the only one addressed by all surveys and thus can be compared across all case study areas: eastern English Channel, the Dogger Bank, the German Bight, and the Gulf of Gdansk. Fishing is one of the oldest activities in all four of the case study areas and though fishers in each area tend to use different gears and face different pressures, there are a number of similarities among them. These pressures include: regulatory pressures, competition with other users, and area restrictions. Modelling the future dynamics of fishing vessels: Having analysed the key determinants of fishers’ and other stakeholders’ decision-making behaviour, the future effects of increased resource-based competition (resulting from a discard ban combined with restrictive individual fish quotas) or of new area-based constraints (e. g., implementation of new wind farms or enforcement of new legally-binding closed areas) were evaluated in the short- and/or the long-term using bio-economic models. The short-term economic effect of implementing wind farms in combination with closed areas was studied in the North Sea using an Individual Stress Level Analysis (ISLA). In this study we used the spatial data of the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) coupled with logbooks to assess the stress potentially caused by closure of fishing areas. The stress was expressed in financial terms as the percentage of current revenue obtained from catch coming from areas to be closed. It is therefore not a loss but more a measure of the level of reallocation of fishing needed to maintain the current revenue. We used the A 2 (“National enterprise” scenario) and B 1 (“Global community scenario”) VECTORS scenarios to design potential closures due to wind farms, nature conservation areas and maritime traffic in the North Sea and we calculated the stress caused by the closures on the Dutch and German 2010 fishing fleets. The scenarios investigated envisage large closures leading to stress levels of 7 to 15 % for the Dutch fleet and 3 to 5 % for the German fleet. Almost all of the Dutch vessels would be impacted by the closures (more than 90 % of vessels in both cases) while the German fleet would be slightly less impacted (around 55 % of vessels impacted for A 2 and 65 % for B 1). All Dutch harbours would have seriously impacted vessels (> 15 % of revenue) for both scenarios, although the proportion of those vessels would be higher in B 1 scenario, especially in the southern harbours. The German harbours would be less impacted with only Büssum showing hosting impacted vessels. We then examined the longer-term effects of fishers competing for resources and/or space. First, we explored the potential effects of a discard ban in mixed fisheries management using the French mixed fisheries in the Eastern English Channel as a model system (DSVM IBM model). The model evaluates a time series of decisions taken by fishers to maximize profits within management constraints. Compliance to management was tested by applying a tax for exceeding the quota, which was varied in the study. We then evaluated the consequences of individual cod quota in both scenarios, with respect to over-quota discarding, spatial and temporal effort allocation and switching between métiers. Individual quota management without a discard ban hardly influenced fishers’ behaviour, as they could fully utilize cod quota and continue fishing other species while discarding cod. In contrast, a discard ban forced fishers to reallocate effort to areas and weeks where cod catch is low, at the expense of lower revenue. In general, a restrictive policy for individual quota for cod needs to be combined with a discard ban and a high tax to reduce over-quota discarding. Second, we evaluated the long-term bio-economic effects of a closed area, using the FISHRENT model, for a variety of scenarios. Regulations and changes in market and environmental conditions may change the profitability of one fishery and can lead to reallocation of fishing effort. The extent of this effort displacement will depend on the relative profitability of the alternative options for the fleet segments affected. When fishing areas and fleet segments are heterogeneous, simple aggregate effort models such as those based on the ideal free distribution theory may provide inaccurate predictions. A bio-economic optimization and simulation model was applied to explore how the different conditions of A 2 (“National enterprise” scenario) and B 1 (“Global community scenario”) could impact the fishing effort allocation and the distribution of benefits across fleet segments from different nations. In the model the optimization of net profits determines the effort adjustment and the investment behaviour of fleet segments, which i...|$|E
40|$|Decisions made by {{fisheries}} managers strongly {{influence the}} overall resource use and environmental impacts {{associated with the}} seafood product from capture fisheries. These findings come from Life Cycle Assessments (LCA), a method that aims at quantifying all relevant resource use and environmental impacts throughout {{the life cycle of}} a product. In this way, important hot spots or improvement potentials can be found. The integrated systems perspective can assist to avoid shifts in impacts between production phases or environmental concerns. LCA is at present a well-established tool to assess environmental impacts of products, but there is no uptake of LCA-based methods or results in fishing policies. Methods for assessing fisheries-specific impacts within the LCA framework are however incomplete. One part of the research therefore addressed indicators related to pressures on marine ecosystems from discard to be used in seafood LCAs. Swedish fisheries on the west coast were evaluated using the trophic indicators mean trophic level (MTL) and primary production required (PPR). PPR could to some extent reflect properties of ecosystem resource use as PPR from the total catch, including discards, varied considerably between fisheries. Still, it was shown {{that it is difficult to}} interpret both indicators in relation to what is known about the ecosystems and the desired properties of the metrics. Complementing metrics of potential pressures on biodiversity are needed. The Swedish IUCN Red List of Threatened Species for fish was evaluated for this purpose. The Red List was found to be coherent with other assessments of vulnerability of fish to exploitation. Different fishing practices also showed different pressures on threatened fish species (aggregated as VEC). VEC together with PPR may thus be used in seafood LCA. Another part of the research explored LCA-based approaches as integrated decision support to form an overall sustainable fisheries management. Studies comprised of Swedish <b>demersal</b> trawling <b>fleets.</b> In the Nephrops fishery, a trade-off was found from promoting species-selective trawls. Local protection of depleted fish stocks comes with an increase in seafloor area swept, fuel use and associated emissions per landed kilo. Even if the overall fuel efficiency of the Swedish <b>demersal</b> trawling <b>fleet</b> has improved between 2002 and 2010, selective trawling required higher fuel use per kilo landing than the equivalent of less selective practices. Improved fuel efficiency was seen from stock rebuilding of the Eastern Baltic cod. However, in another study, the situation of the Eastern Baltic cod fishery was found to have deteriorated in recent years. Selection towards larger size classes has resulted in detrimental ecological consequences, reverberating into poor fish yield and economy. If overall improvements of the present situation are sought for, fisheries management needs to decrease mesh size and effort in the Eastern Baltic cod fishery, as well as include more metrics to assess sustainability. LCA-based methods can provide integrated decision support to inform various seafood policies, and integrate more objectives than is currently done in a fisheries policy context. To foster an overall sustainable seafood production, fisheries managers however need to acknowledge their role in this development. Altogether, stronger effort cuts and shifts in gear are proposed, while stressing the importance to use LCA-based assessments in order to avoid shifting from one environmental pressure to another...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperIn the UK, {{individual}} quotas {{are imposed}} on the <b>demersal</b> whitefish trawl <b>fleet.</b> Many of the key whitefish stocks are at historically low levels, and there is pressure on the industry to adjust to remove the current excess capacity.

In this paper, a translog cost function is used to estimate the returns to scale and 'optimal' scale for the UK demersal whitefish trawlers operating in 2001. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) {{is also used to}} provide estimates of technical efficiency and capacity utilisation that are used {{in the development of the}} long run cost function.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the changes in}} the Dutch <b>demersal</b> fishing <b>fleet</b> since the 1950 s revealed that competitive interactions among vessels and gear types within the constraints imposed by biological, economic and fisheries management factors are the dominant processes governing the dynamics of fishing fleets. Double beam trawling, introduced in the early 1960 s, proved a successful fishing method to catch deep burying flatfish, in particular sole. In less than 10 years, the otter trawl fleet was replaced by a highly specialised beam trawling fleet, despite an initial doubling of the loss rate of vessels due to stability problems. Engine power, size of the beam trawl, number of tickler chains and fishing speed rapidly increased and fishing activities expanded into previously lightly fished grounds and seasons. Following the ban on flatfish trawling within the 12 nautical mile zone for vessels of more than 300 hp in 1975 and with the restriction of engine power to 2000 hp in 1987, the beam trawl fleet bifurcated. Changes in the fleet capacity were related to the economic results and showed a cyclic pattern with a period of 6 ¿ 7 years. The arms race between fishers was fuelled by competitive interactions among fishers: while the catchability of the fleet more than doubled in the ten years following the introduction of the beam trawl, a decline in catchability was observed in reference beam trawlers that remained the same. Vessel performance was not only affected by the technological characteristics but also by the number and characteristics of competing vessels...|$|R
40|$|As quota {{and fishing}} effort {{restrictions}} become tighter, and fuel costs spiral, {{it is likely}} that fishing time will further reduce and therefore the design pressure on fishing vessels of the future will be to improve efficiency when steaming and to retain optimum thrust when trawling. Rules and regulations have shaped our modern trawlers. The necessary fullness for carrying fish is accentuated by the imposition of restrictions in length. While it is generally accepted that there is a penalty in fuel consumption relating to this evolution this study sets out to quantify it. This paper describes the development of a “green trawler” designed to incorporate the highest level of efficiency available in a practical form for use in the <b>demersal</b> fishing <b>fleet.</b> Results from field tests on existing trawlers and towing tank tests on the green trawler design are presented. Comparison is made between a typical demersal trawler, at sea and in the test tank, and the green trawler. The model tests were designed to confirm that the design concept was fuel efficient; and to determine the potential for increased fuel efficiency if certain regulatory restrictions on fishing vessel design parameters were lifted. Savings of 30 % on fuel consumption could be achieved with relatively modest length increases. Additional savings of 10 to 20 % can be achieved by reducing the drag of hull appendages, for example, better alignment of bilge keels. The study concludes by introducing the concept of “Green Tonnage” as an option that should be considered by the EU and Member States, whereby vessel owners would be allowed additional GT’s for new builds over and above existing limits without being penalized. This should be strictly on the basis that no increase in effective fishing effort results...|$|R
40|$|Northern-Central Adriatic Sea. Dynamic {{simulations}} {{were based}} on a spatial ecological model previously calibrat?ed with time series of data. Scenarios regarding spatial management were evaluated with the establishment of two marine protected areas, respectively, in the Pomo pit and the northern region. In addition, three tem?poral simulations of temporary closures and overall reduction of fishing effort of <b>demersal</b> and pelagic <b>fleets</b> (bottom, mid-water trawls and purse seines) were also considered. Simulations were run for 45 years (1975 - 2020), including the calibration period (1975 - 2002), and changes in biomass and catch of marine resources were analyzed. Our results confirm that current fishing management in the Adriatic Sea does not have clear beneficial impacts for the recovery of exploited resources, which will remain depleted in 2020 if "business as usual" continues. Simulations of alternative management suggest that both protected areas could be ben?eficial for fish population recovery predicting an increase in the biomass of commercial fish and predatory organisms. Simulations of temporary closures and overall reduction of fishing effort also show significant benefits for several commercial resources. We argue that both management measures may be effective tools to recover exploited ecosystems of the Northern-Central Adriatic Sea and halt the decline of marine resources...|$|R
5000|$|In South Africa, hake is {{targeted}} by four distinct fisheries: the offshore and inshore demersal trawl fisheries, and the hake longline and hake handline sectors. The offshore demersal trawl fishery {{is by far}} the biggest of the four. Approximately 84% of the hake total allowable catch (TAC) is allocated to the offshore demersal trawl fishery. The inshore trawl and hake longline fisheries are each allocated approximately 6% of the TAC and the handline fishery presently accounts for about 3% of the allocation, although this has not been caught in recent years. [...] Trawling for hake takes place in a near continuous band on well-established grounds that extend from the Namibian border on the west coast to the extreme eastern part of the Agulhas Bank off the south-east coast. [...] Exploitation is predominantly at depths of between 300 to 800m on the west coast and less than 200m on the south coast. [...] The offshore <b>demersal</b> trawl <b>fleet</b> consists of 52 trawlers. Twenty-seven fresh fish trawlers preserve hake on ice and return it to shore for processing, while 18 freezer vessels produce frozen headed and gutted (H&G) hake. Seven more sophisticated freezer trawlers produce frozen fillets at sea [...] The gear configuration consists of “otter trawls” - gear towed along the seabed with trawl doors (or otter boards) keeping the mouth of the net open. Trawlers generally tow their nets at 3.5 knots for one to three hours, mainly in daylight when targeting hake [...] Trawling occurs mainly over sandy sediments, but areas of muddy substrate and coarser, gravely substrates are also trawled [...] A five-year (2014-2019) benthic trawl experiment is currently underway [...] The purpose of the experiment is to determine the environmental impact of demersal trawling in South African waters. It is being implemented by SADSTIA in partnership with the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries, the University of Cape Town, the South African Environmental Observation Network and the South African National Biodiversity Institute. The catch of the offshore demersal trawl sector amounts to approximately 130 000 tonnes per year (2013 catches) [...] although this has varied between 118 and 166 000 tonnes, and consists of approximately 90% M. paradoxus and 10% M. capensis. The main bycatch species are kingklip (Genypterus capensis) and monk (Lophius vomerinus). Trawler owners and operators produce a mix of fresh and frozen products, supplying them to retail and food-service markets both locally and internationally. The main export markets are in Europe, Australia and the United States.|$|R
40|$|High-resolution {{fisheries}} data from integrated logbook and Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) records have revealed a detailed spatial {{structure in the}} species composition of the retained catches of the Irish <b>demersal</b> otter trawl <b>fleets.</b> Hierarchical cluster {{analysis was used to}} define 8 clusters with relatively homogenous species compositions. These clusters formed 34 distinct spatial regions in the waters around Ireland. Identification of these regions can be useful for a number applications, including spatial stratification of commercial or survey data, defining and characterising fishing grounds for marine spatial planning, evaluation of closed areas and prediction of how fishing effort might be re-allocated following a closure. A casestudy is presented that explores options to reduce cod (Gadus morhua) catches by implementing seasonal closures in two of the 34 regions. Cod are caught by demersal trawlers in a mixed fishery and the catches often exceed the quota, resulting in discarding of marketable fish. Two regions were identified that had relatively low effort and high cod landings. The effects of closing these regions during {{the first quarter of the}} year were explored. Cod catches were likely to be reduced by 8 - 22 % while only 3 - 9 % of the annual demersal otter trawl effort would be displaced. Whiting catches were also likely to be reduced, the change in catches of some other species depended on the assumed effort displacement.
