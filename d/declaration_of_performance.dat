In this study, 130 samples taken from 81 stone types belonging to 13 types of petrographic families were tested according to the EN 14231 Standard, taking different finishes into consideration, during a ten year period in the Marble Laboratory of Politecnico di Torino (Italy). A high number of pendulum friction tests (1, 560) were conducted on 780 samples, and more than 7, 000 readings were taken. On {{the basis of the}} obtained results, significant relations were found between the tested petrographic families and the types of finishes. A high correlation between open porosity, quartz content, and slipperiness of the stones with honed surface finishes was found. Moreover, the importance of the petrographic characterization of the stone, in relation to the declared surface finish, emerged as each petrographic family responded differently (according to its composition) to the action of the finishing abrasive...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} be able to draw up a <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Performance,</b> {{manufacturers}} have to go through a process which includes phases of documentation, third party verification and finally certification.

50|$|Depending on the {{applicable}} assessment procedure, the manufacturer must provide technical documentation describing {{in detail the}} construction product, its method of production, eventual test reports performed at third party laboratories (ITT - initial type test), their classification of the results (classification report) and eventual extensions (EXAP - extended application report). This first phase {{is followed by a}} factory audit, with which the appointed notified body verifies if the quality system of the manufacturer at his factory can assure over time constancy in order to preserve for the serial production the declared essential characteristics of the tested specimen. A positive audit leads to the issuing by the notified body of the Certificate of Constancy of Performance with which the manufacturer is authorized to issue the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Performance</b> for his certified construction product.|$|E

30|$|Apart from hazard {{pictograms}} or the ingredient lists, legally required {{information on the}} packaging are, for example, labels for electric and electronic articles [27]. The construction products Regulation [28] foresees an indication of substances of very high concern in the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> for construction products. Furthermore, harmful chemicals are regulated in the toy safety Directive [29], in the Directive regarding medical devices [30], in the Directive regarding active implantable medical devices [31], in the Directive regarding in vitro diagnostic medical devices [32], and in the packaging Directive [33]. Toys for children usually fulfill stricter criteria concerning harmful substances than most other articles, {{but they are not}} necessarily free of them [29]. Products for children like textiles or personal care products are not liable to fulfill stricter standards compared to products for adults, and hence they can contain harmful substances. There are legal provisions for medical devices [30 – 32]; however, they might contain harmful substances at higher concentrations compared to everyday products, because their applications are often exempted from the REACH [34] and CLP provisions.|$|E
