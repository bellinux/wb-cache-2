Our specific aim is to examine the ecological consequences of hydrological change, including emergent issues such as climate change, and focus on the coastal plains in higher rainfall zones where the majority of the Western Australian population resides. Here we argue that human-driven and/or climatically driven hydrological change deserve greater attention, since they: i) directly escalate the risk of extinction for some components of the biota, or ii) are underlying and/or contributing factors in the manifestation of other threats to the biota, and may complicate or exacerbate some of those threats (such as fire, Phytophthora and the spread of weeds).

After it was shown that both absorption bands {{belong to the same}} species of aggregates and to a common excitonic system the shift of the absorption and fluorescence bands under very high hydrostatic pressure as well as the fluorescence anisotropy and the polarization dependent absorption of aligned aggregates indicated that those aggregates probably have a cylindical structure. A concrete model for this structure that was developed {{on the basis of the}} spectroscopic characteristics shows the micellar character of these aggregates. In contrast to the so far assumed incoherent energy migration in the aggregates of TDBC/C 8 the coherent exciton dynamics could be proved by three laserspectroscopic measurement techniques in ps time resolution (APE, TCPP, and TCSPC). Wavelength- and temperature- dependence of the dephasing was attributed to the phonon coupled intraband relaxation. In addition the number of molecules over which one exciton is delocalized on the cylindric aggregates of TDBC/C 8 was found to be comparable to that on the linear J-aggregates of PIC and of TDBC. Based on the <b>exceptional</b> <b>loss</b> of fluorescence-anisotropy at low temperature a very efficient energy conduction was concluded that could be technically used by applying cylindrical dye aggregates as artficial light harvesting systems in dye sensitised solar cells...|$|E
30|$|The Chilean {{evergreen}} rainforest in the Valdivian Rainforest Ecoregion (35 – 48 ° S) is a unique, but endangered, ecosystem. It {{is one of}} the world’s 25 biodiversity hotspots due to its {{abundance of}} vascular plant and vertebrate species and high degree of endemism, as well as a conservation priority due to it undergoing <b>exceptional</b> <b>loss</b> of habitat (Myers et al. 2000; Olson and Dinerstein 1998). This loss is caused basically due to illegal logging and inappropriately conducted legal selective cutting (cut the best and leave the worst; sensu Nyland (2002)), which destroy the multi-aged stand structure of these old-growth forests, leading to thousands of hectares of degraded forests (Moorman et al. 2013; Donoso 2013; Schütz et al. 2012; Myers et al. 2000; Olson and Dinerstein 1998). Old-growth forests of the evergreen forest type harbour the highest tree species richness in Chile and consist of a mixture of mostly shade-tolerant and moderately shade-tolerant (hereafter referred to as “mid-tolerant”) broadleaved evergreen hardwood species and some conifers of the Podocarpaceae family (Donoso and Donoso 2007). The biodiversity associated with the structural and compositional attributes of these old-growth forests must not only be maintained in reserves (Moorman et al. 2013; Bauhus et al. 2009) but also in managed forests, combining the needs of the local population for forest products with biodiversity conservation (Moorman et al. 2013). A promising way to address this is the development of a silviculture regime that: (a) maintains forest attributes that are close to the natural state of old-growth forests; and (b) allows stakeholders to benefit from timber harvesting.|$|E

The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the effect of pH in a wide range on Pcoll loss of the top silt loamy soil rich in organic matter and P for the successful description and prediction of P transport. Materials and methods In batch experiment, soil samples were shaken with deionized water in a wide range of pH from 1. 4 to 9. 9 for 24 h. Then water-dispersible colloids (WDCs) were extracted by pre-centrifugation, microfiltration, and ultracentrifugation processes orderly and determined gravimetrically. The Pcoll values at each pH were calculated as the difference between the concentration of total P in non-ultracentrifuged and ultracentrifuged samples. The same method was applied for the released colloidal mineral elements (Al, Fe, Ca, Si, Mg, Mn). Colloid morphology and P distribution on colloid surface were directly illustrated by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) mapping scanning analyses. Results and discussion Over pH 4. 6 - 6. 0, the released Pcoll was below 5. 5 mg?kg- 1 soil, while up to 66. 8 mg?kg- 1 soil and 28. 5 mg?kg- 1 soil at pH 1. 4 and 9. 9, respectively, indicating that both high and low pH values enhanced the mobilization of Pcoll. At the low pH, the potential loss of Pcoll mainly resulted from the dissolution of inorganic encasing cement such as Al oxides and clay mineral. However, besides electrostatic repulsion, dissolution of organic coating at high pH enhanced the Pcoll release as revealed by the SEM-EDS results. The P was heterogeneously distributed on the WDCs and might be associated with soil organic matter, Al oxides, Fe oxides (oxyhydroxide), and clay mineral at the low pH, while mainly with Fe oxides and less clay mineral at the high pH. Conclusions Both high and low pH enhanced colloid and Pcoll releases. This study first visually revealed that the dissolution of organic cement at high pH enhanced the release of WDCs and their facilitated Pcoll release. The <b>exceptional</b> <b>loss</b> risk of Pcoll may be caused by soil acidification due to the dissolution of inorganic cements, especially in Al-rich soils, and by the enhanced high soil pH due to the dissolution of organic coating in the organic matter-rich soils.

40|$|The Guadalupe Nipomo Dunes Complex (GNDC) {{is located}} within the California Floristic Province, a {{biodiversity}} hotspot characterized by high rates of endemism and <b>exceptional</b> <b>loss</b> of habitat. In 1980, the US Fish and Wildlife Service described the GNDC as, “the most unique and fragile ecosystem in the State of California,” and ranked it first {{on a list of}} 49 habitat areas needing state protection. It is the largest coastal dune area in California and {{it is one of the}} last remaining, relatively intact ecosystems of its type and size in the western United States. The growing recognition of species decline and the limited number of dollars allocated to conservation and restoration have led to development of new conservation planning software and conservation strategies. Marxan and Zonation were selected for this project due to their worldwide acceptance in biodiversity conservation planning as well as their specialization in identifying priority zones for conservation. This document describes the unique use of conservation planning software to select areas for resource allocation. It outlines the process of selecting conservation targets, the habitats and species important to overall health of an ecosystem, by using the expert involvement approach. Most importantly, this document outlines areas of high biodiversity that will later be used to allocate resources for the preservation and protection of biodiversity within the Guadalupe Nipomo Dunes Complex. Introduced species are the second-leading cause (after habitat degradation/loss), causing or contributing to the decline in species abundance and diversity. Ehrharta calycina Smith has become highly invasive in the coastal dune communities of Central and Southern California and currently holds a “high” CAL-IPC inventory rating, defined as a species with severe ecological impacts on physical processes, plant and animal communities and vegetation structure as well as reproductive biology and other attributes conducive to moderate to high rates of dispersal and establishment. Ehrharta calycina is a prolific seeder and stores its seeds annually in the soil, collecting a substantial seedbank. Little is known about E. calycina outside its native range, as its invasion into California coastal ecosystem is fairly recent. A field experiment in the Guadalupe Nipomo Dunes Complex assessed the contribution of seeds originating from the seedbank as compared to seeds from above ground either dropping from maternal plants or blown in from outside the plots to the establishment of new E. calycina cover. After a nine month perios, new E. calycina cover from both sources was not significantly different. Visible coverage of E. calycina began 77 days (November 24, 2015) after plot installation. After nine months of surveying, coverage reached 19 % in the Seedbank Present treatment and 21 % in the Seedbank Absent treatment. There was no significant effect associated with the slope and aspect of the experimental locations. This experiment will aid in management of this invasive species by educating land managers to focus on preventing current seed production of established individuals as those sources of seed were as important as those originating in the seedbank. Stimulating germination of seeds from the seedbank with a concomitant management strategy such as herbicide application or physical removal will likely be the most effective methods for dealing with seeds in the seedbank...|$|E
40|$|Southeast Asia {{experiences}} an <b>exceptional</b> <b>loss</b> {{of natural}} habitat {{due to a}} deforestation rate that strongly increased during the last decades. The first consequence {{is the loss of}} many animal and plant species, threatened by their habitat degradation and by the loss of interactions necessary to the survival of the whole ecosystem. Large mammals and birds populations, the principal dispersal agent of some plant species, already collapsed massively due to hunting and habitat fragmentation and now threaten to die out. Among the large frugivorous species, primates are particularly vulnerable. Only few species, such as macaques, are able to survive in some man-made habitats, due to their opportunistic life-style. But, in the long term, habitat destruction, hunting and capture for local trade threaten their survival. The extinction of primates in Southeast Asian forests would be disastrous for many plant species as primates are among the major seed-dispersal agents. 	The study of Macaca, the only Cercopithecinae genus in Southeast Asia, could provide {{a better understanding of the}} role of cheek-pouched monkeys in tropical rainforest maintenance and restoration. In this study, we chose to focus on northern pigtailed macaques (Macaca leonina) as few studies were carried out on this species, making data concerning its ecology and behavior highly limited. Their seed dispersal capacity, although unknown, is potentially high and pigtailed macaques could be as good seed dispersers as sympatric frugivores. They seem to eat a large number of fruits of many plant species, process seeds with care, and range daily over large areas. Moreover they could have a role in forest maintenance and regeneration given that they seem to eat species with all seed sizes, belonging to all plant life forms present in the forest, and they are able to cross various habitat types (primary as well as secondary forests). 	After providing an outline of our current knowledge on seed dispersal by Cercopithecinae species and their specific role in forest regeneration, our aim was to highlight the importance of northern pigtailed macaques on seed dispersal and thus on forest regeneration by studying (1) how their eco-ethological characteristics can make them effective dispersers, from a quantitative and a qualitative point of view, (2) how the influence of biotic factors, such as resources and predation, on their activities and movements may impact their seed dispersal effectiveness, and (3) what role Macaca spp. can have in a seed dispersal assemblage. 	While following a troop of northern pigtailed macaques habituated to humans in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, we recorded their behavior, travels, and consumed items, from dawn to dusk. Moreover, we studied the spatio-temporal distribution of fruits included in their diet, and the characteristics of their sleeping sites. Finally, we performed germination and viability tests on ingested seeds. 	Results showed that northern pigtailed macaques could disperse thousands of seeds, up to 58 mm in length, coming from the 126 fruit species they eat. Especially, they could disperse them from primary to secondary forest, thanks to handling techniques such as swallowing, spitting and dropping. Finally, the seed passage through their digestive tract mostly had a neutral or positive effect on seed germination and viability. Macaques observed in this study satisfied therefore most requirements defining effective seed dispersers in both quantitative and qualitative terms and we can conclude to the potential importance of Macaca leonina in the tropical rainforest regeneration. 	To confirm the seed dispersal effectiveness of M. leonina, we needed to make sure that its ranging behavior did not negatively affect dispersed seeds. Moreover, given the importance of human food in their diet, we wondered if this resource had a negative impact on seed dispersal. Our results showed that northern pigtailed macaques adapted their ranging pattern according to fruit availability. Moreover, during fruit scarcity, they shifted their diet from frugivorous to omnivorous with an important part of human food. However, human food did not seem to have an impact on seed dispersal in high fruit abundance periods where macaques had a large home range, traveled long distances and ate mainly fruits. However, in low fruit abundance periods, macaques decreased their home range size, traveled shorter distances and ate mainly human food. This latter could have a negative impact on the seed dispersal of some rare fructifying species. However, these species were eaten by many other animal species able to provide good dispersal services. 	Then, we showed that sleeping sites characteristics and pre-sleep behavior in M. leonina were influenced by the proximity of resources and the risk of predation. Given that macaques used few sleeping sites, defecated when they woke up and that all troop members slept concentrated in a small area, we think that they created a high seed density below the sleeping trees. This may be harmful for some seed species but may be beneficial for the ecosystem. Moreover, this pattern may be shown in other effective seed dispersers in the park. So as harmful for seeds it may be, it does not make pigtailed macaques less effective than other frugivores. 	Finally, we demonstrated that Macaca species are important associates in the seed dispersal assemblage found in Southeast Asian forests. Indeed they may disperse most plant species, usually more efficiently dispersed by other frugivores, and thus provide a significant complement in term of dispersal quantity. Moreover, they are sometimes the only frugivores able to disperse the seeds of some species, mainly large-seeded and/or protected ones, and may thus bring them a vital dispersal service...|$|E
40|$|On 26 December 1999, the {{windstorm}} "Lothar" hit {{large parts}} of western and central Europe. In Switzerland, windthrow losses reached 12. 7 Mio m(3) of timber, corresponding to 2. 8 times the annual national timber harvest. Although these <b>exceptional</b> <b>losses</b> were due to extreme peak velocities, recent changes in tree nutrition may have increased forest susceptibility. Previous controlled environment experiments revealed that wood density (associated with wood stiffness) tends to increase in elevated CO 2, and to decrease when N-availability is enhanced (e. g., by soluble N-deposition). Such changes in wood quality could theoretically influence the risk of wind damage. We used the "Lothar" windstorm as a "natural experiment" to explore links between damage and wood properties. In 104 windthrow sites across the Swiss Plateau, more than 1, 600 wood cores from (1) broken, (2) uprooted and (3) still standing (not damaged) spruce trees (Picea abies) were collected in February and March 2000. Wood properties, treering width and chemistry of the wood samples were analysed. Broken trees showed wider treerings in the decade 1990 - 99 compared to non-broken trees (either uprooted or undamaged trees). Broken trees also showed lower non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentration in sapwood, reflecting active structural carbohydrate sinks associated with fast growth. There was also a trend for higher tissue N-concentrations in broken trees. No significant differences between damage types were found in wood density and wood shrinkage during desiccation. We conclude that stem breakage risk of P. abies {{is associated with a}} stimulation of growth in the past decade and with changes in tree nutritional status. However, the risk for windthrow of whole spruce trees (uprooted but not broken) was not related to the studied wood parameters...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} evaluates {{risk management}} for disasters where the losses unfold over time, with two key applications: environmental accidents and <b>exceptional</b> <b>losses</b> in crop production. Both applications evaluate policy against goals of equity and efficiency, but the environmental policy application is a normative analysis, while the production risk application {{is a positive}} analysis. Environmental accidents are stochastic externalities - they impose a social cost not accounted for by whichever business constitutes their source. In many cases, adequate regulation does not exist. We show that standard pollution regulations must be adjusted for accidents, because random triggers and unobservable actions lead to a moral hazard problem. We identify three policies {{that lead to the}} optimal solution when both care and cleanup are considered: strict liability, a stochastic subsidy, and a mandatory mutual insurance scheme. The subsidy policy may be very costly to taxpayers, especially when prevention affects the probability of accident occurrence, and strict liability may be excessively draconian; polluters are also victims and liabilities must exist regardless of adherence to professional standards of care. Thus, we propose a new policy of liability risk-pooling, which demonstrates a role for insurance policy among accidentally polluting firms, even when such firms are profit-maximizers (that is, they are risk neutral). The new policy also generates, in expectation, the most equitable distribution of resources among polluting firms while preserving efficiency - in this sense it is the stochastic equivalent of a system of tradable pollution permits. Our second application addresses production risk in US crop production and the impact of the SURE disaster support program in the 2008 Farm Act. Supplemental disaster insurance is nested insurance, an insurance policy on top of another insurance policy, which may actually increase riskiness in the distribution of outcomes. Thus, we evaluate whether, and under what circumstances, nested insurance actually provides risk management. We develop a comprehensive economic theory of nested insurance, and provide new insight into the concept of targeted subsidies, which use kinked insurance pricing to limit variation in farmers' coverage purchasing decisions. The theoretical evaluation is supported by an in-depth simulation analysis, which simulates the joint price-yield distribution for dramatically different risk profiles of Illinois corn and South Dakota wheat. Using a time series of county- and national-level yields and expected and realized commodity prices, we construct a simulated revenue distribution over which a representative farmer can maximize expected utility. We show that disaster policies may distort acreage and insurance choices, but that these distortions are likely small. Distortions are largest for the primary beneficiaries of the SURE program, the most risk-neutral farmers, who are least in need of risk management. Both applications take a classical, welfare economic approach to policy. In the environmental case, considerations of equity play a larger role as a result of uncertainty, whereas in the crop insurance case, nested insurance is shown to behave more like a stochastic subsidy than actual risk management. Overall, we have shown that managing the risk from disasters across varying economic agents can lead to dramatic distributional implications. When more than one efficient policy is available, then the distributional characteristics of policies will be the deciding factor. However, when equity is the objective, poorly designed disaster policies can backfire and be of little use to those who need them most...|$|R

Such approach overlooks small-sized local hotspots, {{which may be}} rich in endemic and highly threatened species. We explore the importance of mountain rock pools (gueltas) as local biodiversity hotspots in the Sahara-Sahel. Specifically, we considered how many vertebrates (total and endemics) use gueltas, what factors predict species richness, and which gueltas are of most priority for conservation. We expected to provide management recommendations, improve local biodiversity conservation, and simultaneously contribute with a framework for future enhancement of local communities' economy. The identification of local hotspots of biodiversity is important for revaluating global conservation priorities. We quantified the number of vertebrate species from each taxonomic group and endemics present in 69 gueltas in Mauritania, then compared these with species present in a surrounding area and recorded in the country. We evaluated the predictors of species number's present in each guelta through a multiple regression model. We ranked gueltas by their priority for conservation {{taking into account the}} percentage of endemics and threats to each guelta. Within a mere aggregate extent of 43 ha, gueltas hold about 32 % and 78 % of the total taxa analysed and endemics of Mauritania, respectively. The number of species present in each guelta increased with the primary productivity and area of gueltas and occurrence of permanent water. Droughts and human activities threaten gueltas, while 64 % of them are currently unprotected. Gueltas are crucial for local biodiversity conservation and human activities. They require urgent management plans in Mauritania's mountains. They could provide refugia under climate change being important for long-term conservation of Sahara-Sahel biodiversity.

States may be affected, e. g. if wreck removal and clean-up operations become necessary, but also the financial interests and livelihoods of private individuals and businesses, such as local hotels and restaurants who lose earnings from tourists when the coast line becomes covered by a thick layer of crude oil or fisheries who temporarily or permanently lose access to their fishing grounds. Indirectly, the financial interests of many more parties will be affected by the disaster as its consequences ripple on through the local and national economy. This group includes the sub-buyers and final users of the goods as well as underwriters, whether Hull and Machinery (H&M) underwriters or Protection & Indemnity (P&I) insurers of the ship or marine cargo underwriters. Besides the multitude of interests likely to be affected by a maritime casualty involving a ship, there is also a potential for <b>exceptional</b> financial <b>losses</b> resulting from it. It was reported in 2008 that the costs of clean-up operations in Alaska following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 had reached the figure of US$ 3, 5 billion and still counting. But not only oil tankers and ships carrying other hazardous cargoes are capable of generating such enormous losses. Modern container vessels with over 12, 000 TEU capacity may easily have cargoes on board worth hundreds of millions of Euros, as is illustrated by the fires involving the m. v. “Hanjin Pennsylvania” in 2002 and the m. v. “Hyundai Fortune” in 2006, and the voluntary grounding of the “MSC Napoli” in 2007...|$|R
30|$|Table  7 also {{revealed}} that reductions were observed in farmland and settlement, and bare land because the added areas from other LULC classes could not be adequate to compensate the <b>losses.</b> <b>Exceptional</b> shrinkage was observed in farmland and settlement cover by about 14.6 % (263.78  ha/year) possibly due to tough measures taken {{by the government to}} restore areas which were under forests, shrubs, grazing lands and those farmlands not suitable for agriculture (Table  4). The dominant contributors of the existing decline in farmland and settlement was associated with the conversions of its initial extent into grasslands by about 25.4 % (4125.97  ha) and shrubs by about 6.7 % (1097.79  ha) despite some area was largely gained from grasslands (Table  7). The areas previously occupied by farmlands and villages were declined following refusal of forced settlement and inadequate reaction from the transitional government in early 1990 s. However, tough measures on land restoration were taken {{at the end of this}} study period that substantially reduced areas occupied by farmlands. Despite the fact that bare land constituted a very small spatial extent in the watershed, its original extent was decreased as much as 24.9 % at the rate of 10.5  ha/year (Table  4). The decline was contributed mainly by the conversion of the initial extent into grasslands by about 54.8 % (208.8  ha). This indicated that once the area is out of production and physically unsuitable for either of human uses, the area were exempted from any human contact and eventually recovered largely into grasslands.|$|R
40|$|A sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) {{in early}} January 2013 caused the Arctic polar vortex to split and {{temperatures}} to rapidly {{rise above the}} threshold for chlorine activation. However, ozone in the lower stratospheric polar vortex from late December 2012 through early February 2013 reached the lowest values on record for that time of year. Analysis of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) trace gas measurements and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) data shows that <b>exceptional</b> chemical ozone <b>loss</b> early in the 2012 / 13 Arctic winter resulted from a unique combination of meteorological conditions associated with the early-January 2013 SSW: unusually low temperatures in December 2012, offspring vortices within which air remained well isolated for nearly 1 month after the vortex split, and greater-than-usual vortex sunlight exposure throughout December 2012 and January 2013. Conditions in the two offspring vortices differed substantially, with the one overlying Canada having lower temperatures, lower nitric acid (HNO 3), lower hydrogen chloride, more sunlight exposure/higher ClO in late January, and a later onset of chlorine deactivation than the one overlying Siberia. MLS HNO 3 and CALIPSO data indicate that PSC activity in December 2012 was more extensive and persistent than {{at that time in}} any other Arctic winter in the past decade. Chlorine monoxide (ClO, measured by MLS) rose earlier than previously observed and was the largest on record through mid-January 2013. Enhanced vortex ClO persisted until mid-February despite the cessation of PSC activity when the SSW started. Vortex HNO 3 remained depressed after PSCs had disappeared; passive transport calculations indicate vortex-averaged denitrification of about 4 parts per billion by volume. The estimated vortex-averaged chemical ozone loss, ~ 0. 7 – 0. 8 parts per million by volume near 500 K (~ 21 km), was the largest December/January loss in the MLS record from 2004 / 05 to 2014 / 15...|$|R
40|$|In Germany, white storks (Ciconia ciconia) count {{approximately}} 4, 000 breeding pairs and {{are listed}} as endangered species. Since 2005, recurrent major declines in homecoming adult storks (regionally > 30 %) of the Eastern migrating population and in breeding success were monitored. Coincidentally, {{for the first time}} <b>exceptional</b> total breeding <b>losses</b> were recorded due to fungal infections of the airways. Although fungi can cause significant losses in poultry industry and in wild birds kept in captivity, no information were available on the relevance of fungal infections in free-ranging wild birds before fledging. Chitridiomycosis of amphibians and white nose syndrome of bats are two timely examples for rapid spread of previously unknown fungal infections causing a preciptious decline of animal populations. The prinicipal aim of this study was, thus, to perform systematic postmortem examinations on white stork chicks to investigate mortality factors and to assess the role of fungi as potential causative agents. One hundred and three deceased white stork chicks were necropsied during a three year period (2007 - 2009) and causes of mortality and morbidity identified by histopathology. Unexpectedly, 45. 6 % of the animals had fungal pneumonia. Trauma also constituted a significant percentage of direct mortality factors. Only eight chicks had a lethal bacterial or parasitic infection. Interestingly, about 95 % of the chicks with fungal pneumonia died in the first third of their nestling period. In all cases molds were isolated from lung tissue and identified by morphology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer region. Aspergillus fumigatus was identified as primary causative agent in 60 % of the cases followed by several zygomycetes. No previously unknown fungi were identified. In one chick, Thermomyces lanuginosus, previously unknown to cause respiratory infection, was identified. Accurate species diagnosis of Aspergillus spp. in invasive aspergillosis (IA), although long known as respiratory disease of animals and man, is still challenging due to environmental contamination and colonization resulting in false-positive results. Therefore, results of this study achieved by conventional culturing were verified by a newly established diagnostic method based on laser capture microdissection technology. Intralesional specific fluorescence-stained single fungal structures which has been identified by histopathology can thus be aseptically microdissected with a UVA laser system. Fungal species identification is then achieved by PCR and subsequent sequencing. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated by this technique that polyclonal infections of A. fumigatus in birds may occur regularly. Based on the previous results it was hypothesized that certain A. fumigatus strains with a higher prevalence and virulence do occur in white stork chicks. To test this hypothesis, genomic fingerprinting was performed by multilocus microsatellite typing of 61 clinical and environmental isolates from six different nesting sites in part with subsequent IA outbreaks over a period of four years. The results show a very high genetic diversity and in contrast to the hypothesis no cluster enriched for certain genotypes at the nesting sites. However, previous results suggesting polyclonal infections of A. fumigatus in birds could be confirmed by this method and were additionally verified by a multiplex PCR that identifed both fungal mating types in each bird. Based on the typing results, the virulence potential of selected strains was subsequently assessed in a novel infection model using embryonated chicken eggs. The majority of strains thereby showed no differences in virulence in the in vivo model, independent of their origin. In summary, the overall data did not support the initial hypothesis that certain A. fumigatus strains with a higher prevalence and virulence do occur in white stork chicks. Instead, {{the results of this study}} support the concept that other currently unknown factors may predispose white storks for fungal infections in the first third of their nestling period. In this concept, we are currently analysing the influcence of climate as potential environmental stressor. Initial results have shown an apparent correlation between an abrupt temperature decline and the death of chicks by fungal infections a few days later. Future studies will have to further address this correlation and the influence of fungal infections and other factors on the stability of white stork population in a systematic long term monitoring program...|$|R
