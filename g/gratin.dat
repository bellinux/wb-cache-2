5|$|In India, {{squashes}} (ghia) {{are cooked}} with seafood such as prawns. In France, marrows (courge) are traditionally {{served as a}} <b>gratin,</b> sieved and cooked with butter, milk, and egg, and flavored with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and as soups. In Italy, zucchini and larger squashes are served {{in a variety of}} regional dishes, such as cocuzze alla puviredda cooked with olive oil, salt and herbs from Puglia; as torta di zucca from Liguria, or torta di zucca e riso from Emilia-Romagna, the squashes being made into a pie filling with butter, ricotta, parmesan, egg, and milk; and as a sauce for pasta in dishes like spaghetti alle zucchine from Sicily. In Japan, squashes such as small C. moschata pumpkins (kabocha) are eaten boiled with sesame sauce, fried as a tempura dish, or made into balls with sweet potato and Japanese mountain yam.|$|E
25|$|Sole au <b>gratin</b> is a raw fish {{style of}} <b>gratin,</b> which often {{is covered with}} a {{mushroom}} covering. Many fish-based gratins use a white <b>gratin</b> sauce and cheese, and achieve browning quickly. Cozze gratinate is a mussels-based recipe found in Italy.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the well-known potato dishes such as <b>Gratin</b> dauphinois, cooking au <b>gratin</b> is a widely used cooking technique {{in the preparation of}} numerous dishes including many meat, fish, vegetable and pasta dishes, fennel, leeks, crab meat, celeriac and aubergines (eggplant).|$|E

5|$|The Jewish {{community}} {{that lived in}} Ottoman Syria prior to Zionist immigration that began in 1881 {{was known as the}} Old Yishuv. The cooking style of the community was Sephardi cuisine, which developed among the Jews of Spain before their expulsion in 1492, and in the areas to which they migrated thereafter, particularly the Balkans and Ottoman Empire. Sephardim also established communities in the Old Yishuv. Particularly in Jerusalem, they continued to develop their culinary style, influenced by Ottoman cuisine, creating a style that became known as Jerusalem Sephardi cuisine. This cuisine included pies like sambousak, pastels and burekas, vegetable <b>gratins</b> and stuffed vegetables, and rice and bulgur pilafs, which are now considered to be Jerusalem classics.|$|R
40|$|We study solar-cell designs using nano-grating on both top (transmission) {{and bottom}} (reflection) {{of the solar}} cell. First, we perform {{simulations}} based on rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) to evaluate the diffraction top <b>gratins.</b> In RCWA method, we calculate up to 20 harmonics, and sweep the launch angle of incident light from 0 to 90 degree. The incident light varies from 100 nm to 1200 nm wavelength. Triangular grating can achieve higher light absorption compared to the rectangular grating. The best top grating is around 200 nm grating period, 100 nm grating height, and 50 % filling factor, which responses to 37 % improvement for triangular grating and 23 % for rectangular grating compared to non-grating case. Then, we use Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) to simulate transmission/reflection double grating cases. We simulated triangular-triangular (top-bottom) grating cases and triangular-rectangular (top-bottom) grating case. We realize solar cell efficiency improvement about 42. 4 %. For the triangular-rectangular (top-bottom) grating case, the 20 % efficiency improvement is achieved. Finally, we present weighted-light simulation for the double grating {{for the first time}} and show the best grating can achieve 104 % light improvement, which is quite different from traditional non-weighted calculation...|$|R

500|$|On 7 June at Royal Ascot he contested the Ascot Gold Cup, the year's most {{important}} staying race. Fordham sent {{him into the}} lead {{a mile from the}} finish and he won easily by three lengths from Dutch Oven and Wallenstein. On {{the last day of the}} Royal meeting he took the lead on the turn into the straight and won by a length and a half from Iroquois and eight others under top weight of 138 pounds to take his second Hardwicke Stakes. His winning time of 2:37 was considered exceptionally fast for the date. By this time he was being described as [...] "about the best horse of the day in England", and [...] "the present champion of the English turf", although he was also called [...] "a bad horse to ride". An example of Tristan's problematic behaviour came on Newmarket Heath that summer when he attacked a horse named <b>Gratin,</b> who was acting as his training companion. <b>Gratin</b> was left lame whilst his rider, whom Tristan also attempted to savage, escaped with a black eye. Another of Tristan's [...] "victims" [...] was a stable boy, whom he reportedly [...] "shook like a rat". His poor behaviour was blamed for contributing to his two defeats at Newmarket in July.|$|E
5000|$|Cousances {{enameled}} {{cast iron}} skillets, pans, <b>gratins,</b> and pots were {{produced in the}} town of Cousances-les-Forges [...] and had features which distinguished them from their competitors, Le Creuset, Descoware of Belgium, and the Scandinavian Copco. Among those features were the base, which was left without enamel (like Copco) but sealed against rust with the final glaze (unlike Copco), and the skillet design which was a French version of the classic American skillet popularized by Griswold and WagnerWare, having two pour spouts, a cast on handle, and a lifting tab on the largest of the handled skillets. That skillet design was altered to include rounded sides for tossing/ sauteeing, and the lift tab being added to smaller skillets for easier pouring. That refinement made the Cousances 20 cm and 26 cm skillets a hit with cooks, who use the skillet as a saucepan for gravies and glazes, because the gravies could be made right in the skillet in which the chops or chicken was fried, and glazes could be perfected much more easily than in a deeper saucepan, and the finished product was easily poured into other containers thanks to the tabs, spouts and handles. The Cousances designs are now produced by Le Creuset from the original patterns, in the original foundry/factory. The small, round medallion style logo which once read [...] "Cousances, Made in France" [...] around the centimeter size, now reads [...] "Le Creuset, Made in France". Le Creuset has changed the colors of the cookware in the old Cousances patterns; but Cousances pots, pans, skillets, roasters and Dutch ovens are still to be found as used pieces, and are recognizable by the medallion logo, glazed natural color cast iron bottoms, which they share with the Le Creuset current line.|$|R

New Orleanians say the cuisine's the real thing, starting with the biscuits, served with a pepper jelly and cream cheese condiment, continuing on to deviled eggs, charbroiled oysters, and crabmeat and artichoke <b>gratin</b> starters; and even further to jambalaya, étouffée, red snapper in an almondine sauce and barbecue shrimp.

He called a macaroni <b>gratin</b> with mushrooms and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese [...] "fantastic" [...] and said that an apple crumble was [...] "awesome". Mark Bollard, in his review of the restaurant for the Evening Standard in 2009, was not expecting much from the restaurant. However, he called his Caesar salad starter a [...] "revelation" [...] and said that the chocolate brownie was [...] "dense, dark and rich". Although he was disappointed with the polenta chips, he said overall that the food was [...] "utterly sublime" [...] and he suggested that Ramsay should expand the concept to railway stations across London.

2500|$|<b>Gratin</b> (...) is a {{widespread}} culinary technique in which an ingredient is topped with a browned crust, often using breadcrumbs, grated cheese, egg and/or butter. <b>Gratin</b> originated in French cuisine and is usually prepared {{in a shallow dish}} of some kind. A <b>gratin</b> is baked or cooked under an overhead grill or broiler to form a golden crust on top and is traditionally served in its baking dish.|$|E
2500|$|Potatoes gratiné {{is one of}} {{the most}} common of gratins and is known by various names {{including}} [...] "gratin potatoes" [...] and [...] "Gratin de pommes de terre". Slices of boiled potato are put in a buttered fireproof dish, sprinkled with cheese and browned in the oven or under the grill. May also be based under a steamed; crust of potatoes carefully created for this thus purpose. In North America, the dish is referred to variously as scalloped potatoes, potatoes au <b>gratin,</b> or au <b>gratin</b> potatoes. (Note that the term scalloped originally referred to a style of seafood dish rather than to one specifically based on the scallop.) In French-speaking Canada, the dish is referred to as patates au <b>gratin.</b> Australians and New Zealanders refer to it as scalloped potatoes or potato bake.|$|E
2500|$|Lyon {{is noted}} as a gastronomic centre of France and specialities served in its {{traditional}} bouchons include Lyon sausage, sophisticated salami (known there as [...] "rosette"), tripe and quenelles.

2500|$|The {{etymology}} of <b>gratin</b> is {{from the}} French language words gratter, meaning [...] "to scrape" [...] or [...] "to grate" [...] (for example, [...] "scrapings" [...] of bread or cheese), and gratiné, from the transitive verb form of the word for crust or skin. The technique predates the current name which did not appear in English until 1846 (OED, s.v. [...] "gratin").|$|E
2500|$|Although {{nowadays}} vorschmack {{is mainly}} associated with Jewish cuisine in Russia, historically {{different versions of}} this dish (...) were known there. These were usually hot zakuski (appetizers) or breakfast dishes. A Gift to Young Housewives, a classical Russian cookbook by Elena Molokhovets, provides three recipes of hot vorschmack in its first edition (1861) and further variants were added in subsequent editions. In one recipe, meat (veal or beef), herring, white bread and onions are minced, mixed with smetana (sour cream) or cream and baked. Other recipes include only herring (without meat), {{as well as other}} ingredients, such as potatoes, eggs and apples. Even more elaborate recipes with further details on cooking techniques are given in another classical Russian cookery textbook, The Practical Fundamentals of the Cookery Art (1899–1916) by Pelageya Alexandrova-Ignatieva. It was in particular proposed to place the mixture of minced ingredients inside a kalach, cover it with grated cheese and bake it au <b>gratin.</b> Similar recipes also appear in Cookery (1955), a major cookbook of Soviet cuisine.|$|E

60|$|And then I {{understood}} he {{had merely}} intended a question. I owned up that I was, and accused him in turn {{of being a}} Frenchman. He admitted it.

6000|$|... "This {{interesting}} {{person is}} an ex-Zouave in the French army. Instead of making excuses, he confessed that the barbarous tastes of the English and American visitors had so discouraged him, {{that he had}} lost all pride and pleasure in the exercise of his art. As an example of what he meant, he mentioned his experience of two young Englishmen who could speak no foreign language. The waiters reported that they objected to their breakfasts, and especially to the eggs. Thereupon (to translate the Frenchman's own way of putting it) he exhausted himself in exquisite preparations of eggs. Eggs a la tripe, au <b>gratin,</b> a l'Aurore, a la Dauphine, a la Poulette, a la Tartare, a la Venitienne, a la Bordelaise, and so on, and so on. Still the two young gentlemen were not satisfied. The ex-Zouave, infuriated; wounded in his honor, disgraced as a professor, insisted on an explanation. What, in heaven's name, did they want for breakfast? They wanted boiled eggs; and a fish which they called a Bloaterre. It was impossible, he said, to express his contempt for the English idea of a breakfast, in the presence of ladies. You know how a cat expresses herself {{in the presence of a}} dog--and you will understand the allusion.

Casinos were not invented: clubs were rather rare luxuries: there were sanded floors, triangular sawdust-boxes, pipes, and tavern parlours. Young Smith and Brown, from the Temple, did not go from chambers to dine at the Polyanthus, or the Megatherium, off potage a la Bisque, turbot au <b>gratin,</b> cotelettes a la What-do-you-call-'em, and a pint of St. Emilion; but ordered their beefsteak and pint of port from the [...] "plump head-waiter at the Cock;" [...] did not disdain the pit of the theatre; and for a supper a homely refection at the tavern. How delightful are the suppers in Charles Lamb to read of even now!--the cards--the punch--the candles to be snuffed--the social oysters--the modest cheer! Whoever snuffs a candle now? What man has a domestic supper whose dinner-hour is eight o'clock? Those little meetings, in the memory of many of us yet, are gone quite away into the past. Five-and-twenty years ago is a hundred years off--so much has our social life changed in those five lustres. James Boswell himself, were he to revisit London, would scarce venture to enter a tavern. He would find scarce a respectable companion to enter its doors with him. It is an institution as extinct as a hackney-coach. Many a grown man who peruses this historic page has never seen such a vehicle, and only heard of rum-punch as a drink which his ancestors used to tipple.|$|E
