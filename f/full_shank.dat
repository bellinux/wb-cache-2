25|$|Shanks are {{typically}} made from leather, plastic, cardstock, or layers of glue-hardened burlap. The flexibility of a shank {{is determined by}} its thickness {{and the type of}} material used. A shank's thickness may be consistent throughout or it may vary along its length to produce different strengths at select points. For example, slits may be cut across a shank at demi-pointe to enhance roll through. Also, a shank's thickness may transition at some point along its length in order to implement differing strengths above and below the transition. Standard pointe shoes typically have a <b>full</b> <b>shank,</b> in which the shank runs the full length of the sole, or fractional (e.g., half or three-quarter) length shanks. Many pointe shoe manufacturers offer a choice of shank materials, and some will build shoes with customized shanks of varying stiffness and length.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relation}} of the upper shank (purchase) - the shank length from the mouthpiece to the cheekpiece rings—and the lower shank or lever arm—the shank length from the mouthpiece to the lowest rein ring, {{is important in the}} severity of the bit. The standard curb bit has a 1½" [...] cheek and a 4½" [...] lower shank, thus producing a 1:3 ratio of cheek to lower shank, a 1:4 ratio of cheek to <b>full</b> <b>shank,</b> thus producing 3 lbs of pressure on the chin groove and 4 lbs of pressure on the horse's mouth for every 1 lb placed on the reins (3 and 4 newtons respectively for every newton).|$|E

5000|$|Not to be {{confused}} with hiking boots, mountaineering boots are usually taller, stiffer, and insulated. The boots can be made of leather, plastic, or modern synthetic materials like Kevlar. The extra height and stiffness of mountaineering boots helps support the climber in steep terrain where flexible boots could cause unsure footing and possibly result in a fall. This extra stiffness is traditionally achieved {{through the use of a}} <b>full</b> steel <b>shank,</b> though some manufacturers have begun to use carbon fiber to create the necessary stiffness.|$|R

He {{has released}} one studio album under Majik Ninja Entertainment. He has also been in supergroups Psychopathic Rydas (Bullet, <b>Full</b> Clip, Lil <b>Shank,</b> Foe Foe, Cell Block, Sawed Off) and The Underground Avengers (Boondox, Bukshot, ClaAs). He was signed to Southern Hustlas Inc. (2004-2005), Psychopathic Records (2005-2012; 2013-2015) and Majik Ninja Entertainment (2016-present).|$|R
