Methods: Three independent searches about PRP <b>extraction</b> <b>devices</b> were carried out. Device suppliers were contacted and an individually meeting was called with each one. Characteristics of each device was reviewed by virtual demonstration. A kits comparison chart was made with all the information acquired. Kits were classified as Closed-Technique and Opened- Technique {{in accordance with the}} AEMPS technical committee report. Results: Ten devices were found: ACP®; Angel®, Cascade®, Endoret ®, GPS®, Magellan®, Minos®, Ortho-pras®, Smart-prepr® and Tricell®.
