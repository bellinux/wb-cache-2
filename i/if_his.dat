5|$|Some Russian nationalists, such as Dmitry Rogozin and the Movement Against Illegal Immigration, {{stated that}} they would like to see Lukashenko become President of Russia in 2008.

5|$|A Roman by birth, Honorius {{may have}} been one of those chosen by Pope Gregory the Great for the Gregorian mission to England, {{although}} it seems more likely that {{he was a member of}} the second party of missionaries, sent in 601.

5|$|A seizure {{does not}} occur just because the {{government}} questions an individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized <b>if</b> <b>his</b> freedom of movement is not restrained. The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving into}} the Kirchherr family's house, Sutcliffe used to borrow her clothes, as he was the same height as Kirchherr. He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, {{oversized}} shirts, and long scarves.

5|$|After {{the events}} of November 1, the Terminal and Traction Company hired 300 {{professional}} strikebreakers from the Pinkerton Agency in Chicago to operate the streetcars. Todd wrote {{an open letter to}} the city leadership alleging that illegitimate forces from outside the state were behind the events, and that his workers did not truly desire to unionize. He wrote that <b>if</b> <b>his</b> workers could only get adequate police protection, they could resume normal operations.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 14th century, {{the castle}} was used as a refuge by Richard II from the forces of his rival, Henry Bolingbroke. On 12August 1399, after {{returning}} from Ireland, Richard {{made his way to the}} castle where he met Bolingbroke's emissary, Henry Percy, for negotiations. Percy swore in the chapel he would not harm the king. On 19 August, Richard surrendered to Percy at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate <b>if</b> <b>his</b> life were spared. The king was then taken to London and died later in captivity at Pontefract Castle.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult to}} detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure <b>if</b> <b>his</b> style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E

5|$|Dave Pear, the Buccaneers' first Pro Bowl {{selection}} and most popular player, {{was traded to}} the Oakland Raiders for two draft picks. This was partly to get extra help in what was expected to be a strong offensive draft, but also because Pear had requested that he be traded <b>if</b> <b>his</b> contract could not be renegotiated. Dave Green, the punter and kicker through the first three seasons, had to be replaced when he tore his achilles tendon stepping over a tackling dummy in training camp.|$|E
5|$|Director of {{photography}} Mark Irwin was fired during filming of Screams finale, {{a week before}} principal photography was to be completed. Upon review of the dailies, Craven found the footage was out of focus and unusable. Irwin was initially ordered to fire his camera crew.

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Stephen II of Hungary, Ladislaus's shrine in the cathedral of Várad became a {{preferred}} venue for trials by ordeal. However, it cannot be determined whether Ladislaus became subject to veneration soon after his death, or <b>if</b> <b>his</b> cult emerged after he was canonized by Béla III of Hungary on 27 June 1192. Béla {{had lived in the}} Byzantine court, where Ladislaus's daughter, Irene, was venerated as a saint.|$|E

5|$|E. Midy {{proved a}} general result about such fractions, now called Midy's theorem, in 1836. The {{publication}} was obscure, {{and it is}} unclear <b>if</b> <b>his</b> proof directly involved 0.999..., {{but at least one}} modern proof by W. G. Leavitt does. If it can be proved that a decimal of the form 0.b1b2b3... is a positive integer, then it must be 0.999..., which is then the source of the 9s in the theorem. Investigations in this direction can motivate such concepts as greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic, Fermat primes, order of group elements, and quadratic reciprocity.|$|E
5|$|Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60 (1942), is a {{landmark}} U.S. Supreme Court decision on two issues of constitutional criminal procedure.

5|$|Gore's {{financial}} speculations in {{the late}} 1780s significantly multiplied his wealth. In 1788 he and Andrew Craigie, a Boston businessman who had retained Gore for legal services, entered into a secret agreement to purchase Continental securities with a face value of $100,000 in a speculative bid that their value would rise. By late October of that year, the pair had met this goal: Gore had purchased $90,000 worth of paper for about $20,000, and encouraged Craigie to purchase more than the $11,000 he had acquired <b>if</b> <b>his</b> funding would allow for it. Gore also purchased Massachusetts war-related debts, and lobbied Massachusetts Congressmen for the U.S. government to assume those as well.|$|E
