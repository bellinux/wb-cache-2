Ichikawa had heard that Curtis was very thin, so he decided to use him, as the {{characters}} in the story have eaten very little. Ichikawa specifically told each actor how he wanted them to react, and would not rehearse. Ichikawa expressed that the narrator (Tamura) could not be a cannibal because then he would have crossed the ultimate low. Ichikawa consulted with his wife, Natto Wada, and they decided against having him eat human flesh. As a result, Tamura never eats any in the film because his teeth are falling out.|$|E
25|$|Initially, a {{group of}} benevolent {{creditors}} placed the company into receivership, believing it <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> some time to trade {{its way out of}} difficulty. Unfortunately, the group appointed Sommers N. Smith himself as receiver, and when it was discovered that Seddinger and Smith had awarded themselves a large dividend out of capital {{in the midst of the}} company's troubles, as well as engaging in fraudulent bookkeeping, the remaining creditors' confidence was shaken. Seddinger and Smith were removed from their positions, and a more competent receiver appointed, but the latter was unable to persuade the creditors to make the necessary investments to revive the company's fortunes, and in May 1908 the Neafie & Levy plant was sold for the sum of only $50,000.|$|E
25|$|The post lunch {{session was}} one of the most {{dramatic}} sessions in Test history. VVS Laxman played one of his best knocks along with Ishant Sharma for most of the post lunch session. He was happy to give Ishant most of the strike with Ishant stone-walling the rest of the over. Occasional boundaries (mainly from Sharma) and early singles off every over had India slowly, but surely inching towards their target. In what seemed like forever, India crawled from 124/8 to 170, 180 and 190/8. Finally Ishant got out to a Ben Hilfenhaus lbw decision that replays showed was going down the leg side, with the score at 205. Pragyan Ojha, the last man for India joined Laxman at the crease. During Mitchell Johnson's over more drama followed with Ojha being clearly struck in line, but On-field Umpire Billy Bowden turned down the appeal. Pragyan Ojha tried to sneak a single when substitute fielder Steven Smith shied at the stumps. But unfortunately for Australia, no fielders where backing his throw. It went for four overthrows meaning India <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> 2 runs to win.|$|E

25|$|The 2006 Trojans {{came out}} strong, easily {{defending}} their top 10 status throughout the year. As the season progressed, USC began to display marked inconsistencies, as their margins of victory began to slip. The first setback {{proved to be}} a 31–33 loss to unranked Oregon State, in which the Beavers were able to repeatedly capitalize on several Trojan turnovers. Even though USC dropped initially in the polls, they worked their way back up. After defeating both Cal and Notre Dame, they held the number 2 spot heading into the final week of the season. The Trojans were considered to be a virtual lock for the National Championship Game against Ohio State and <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> to beat UCLA. USC was shocked in the final game of the season, losing to crosstown rival UCLA 13–9. This eliminated the Trojans from championship contention and opened the door for Florida to become Ohio State's opponent. The Trojans did earn a Rose Bowl bid and defeated Michigan 32-18. It was the Trojans fifth straight BCS Bowl appearance.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Allen was {{released}} by the Chiefs, the New York Giants signed Allen to their practice squad. The Giants signed Allen to the active roster in early October 2002 following a series of injuries to their offensive linemen. Allen was active as a backup offensive lineman {{for the remainder of}} the regular season, but he never played a down on the offensive line. In a mid-October game against the Atlanta Falcons, Allen was forced into action as a defensive lineman on goal-line plays when multiple starting linemen were injured. Speaking about the situation, defensive line coach Denny Marcin stated [...] "I told Ian, 'You line up on the right side and go straight ahead.' I <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> a body." [...] Allen was active for the Giants' loss to the San Francisco 49ers in the wild card playoff round.|$|E

The moving background, filmed on an elevated freeway in Tokyo, was added later.

We let a bit of air out of the tires of the van and kept a constant 60 kilometers an hour.

[...] According to Lee, she was unsure at the time when—or if—Evanescence would continue. After taking a break from music for 18 months, she decided she wanted to work with the band members and it [...] "became more of a group project". Lee admitted to an identity crisis: [...] " [...] Fallen happened really fast, and it was just go, go, go for a couple years, and we went right into writing and wrote the next record. By the time we finished touring with The Open Door, I <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> to go, 'Who am I as an adult?

[...] While bemoaning the state of Harrison's voice and the [...] "sonic patchwork" [...] nature of the set, Leng notes that both [...] "So Sad" [...] and [...] "Far East Man" [...] were received positively when first released on albums by Alvin Lee & Mylon LeFevre and Ron Wood, respectively. The difference in winter 1974–75, Leng continues, was that, by championing Ravi Shankar's Indian music segments during the tour and neglecting his duties as an ex-Beatle in America, Harrison had [...] "committed the cardinal counterculture sin – he had rejected 'rock 'n' roll'".|$|E
500|$|... "A Toast to Men" [...] was {{produced}} by Toby Gad, who contributed to the songwriting with Willa Ford and Rhonda Robinson. Tom Coyne served as the track's mastering engineer. The track features vocals by American rapper Lady May. Ford spent roughly two years working on material following the release of her debut album Willa Was Here (2001). The concept for the song was developed from her experiences at a sorority party. While discussing {{the inspiration for the}} single, Ford said that she heard girls at a sorority party doing a chant, and felt like writing a song using it. She was uncertain if her record label would release the song given its provocative content. When talking about her intentions behind the lyrics, she confessed: [...] "I was part of the revolution, as far as changing the way people think of pop music. I wanted it to be sexy and fierce and be OK to say the word 'fuck.' I <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> some time {{to get out of it}} and figure out what the fuck was going on." ...|$|E

Gough explains that, when casting for the role, they looked to Margot Kidder—Lois Lane in the Superman film series—for inspiration. They wanted an actress who was [...] "pretty", [...] "smart", and who came with some [...] "wit". Dozens of actresses auditioned for the role of Lois Lane, {{but it was not until}} a tape from Erica Durance showed up that everyone felt that they had found the right Lois. As executive producer Greg Beeman describes Durance, [...] "She had a toughness about her. She was tough and sexy and direct." [...] Another plus, according to Beeman, was the chemistry between Durance and Tom Welling. Durance came on set that first afternoon and the two hit it off, becoming friends and developing a brother/sister relationship on the set.|$|E

And boy, was it." [...] He also praised the Peggy/Jarvis dynamic, the MCU tie-ins and connections the series included, such as the Black Widow program, and the strong portrayals of the season's supporting characters. Amy Ratcliffe at Nerdist called the season [...] "a memorable splash" [...] a noted {{that the lack of}} filler in the short season lead to [...] "action-packed but not overstuffed" [...] episodes. She praised the [...] "period aspect that's defined so well by music, sets, and costumes" [...] as placing the series [...] "head and shoulders above others", and called the cast [...] "eminently talented". On the other hand, Lowry ultimately found the series [...] "just didn't have legs", saying that after the premiere it [...] "meandered through several episodes that merely seemed to inch the story along, rallying only slightly in the not wholly satisfying conclusion." [...] He felt that outside of Atwell's Carter and D'Arcy's Jarvis that characters were not developed enough, and said that the MCU tie-in with Toby Jones' Arnim Zola made the series seem like [...] "a footnote".|$|E

He also matched the 2009 NBA Draft Combine record, and surpassed the event's best lane agility time. Frazier did not participate in Penn State's exhibition opener against Slippery Rock. Coach DeChellis said, [...] "Billy Oliver, Sasa , Tim Frazier, Jermaine Marshall, they haven't played in this yet, so it was important just to get out there." [...] In his first official appearance against Pennsylvania, Frazier added 2 points and 1 rebound in a scoreless performance. He was only allowed 8 minutes of play time. He scored his first points against Robert Morris the following contest, with a game-high 19 points off the bench. He shot 6-of-11 from the field, and 4-of-5 on three-pointers. Frazier also contributed 3 assists, 2 rebounds, and 1 steal in 30 minutes on the court. DeChellis said, [...] "(Tim) is a hard guy to contain.
