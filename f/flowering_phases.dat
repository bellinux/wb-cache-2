40|$|Behaviour of {{different}} ecotypes of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.) under water deficit during budding and <b>flowering</b> <b>phases.</b> Despite numerous uses and its well known nutritional value, okra is cultivated on very small surfaces, on surroundings of traditional houses and often in dumping ground. To this little interest are added drought, diseases and pests that generate an important reduction of yield, leading okra {{to play the}} last roles in agricultural research programs {{of the country and}} this, despite the existence of early maturing ecotypes or resistant to some abiotic constraints. The low rate of improved varieties is the proof {{that it is necessary to}} develop strategies for participatory breeding programs that take into account farmers selection criteria including genotypes tolerant or resistant to drastic conditions such as water deficit to periods where the plant is expressing its genetic potential. Six ecotypes obtained through participatory plant breeding process in five agricultural districts of the country have been assessed for the tolerance to the drought occurring during the budding and the <b>flowering</b> <b>phases.</b> Results show that water deficit during budding phase has disastrous consequences for okra plants. The yield declines, and also the length, the number and the weight of fruits. Two types of period of <b>flowering</b> <b>phases</b> of okra plant have been observed: the period which intervenes during the accelerated growth phase of the main stem (type 1) and the one which starts once the growth of main stem begins to decline (type 2); this last type is the most frequently met. Water deficit during the phase of budding causes earlier flowering of type 2 plants and leads to delayed flowering of the type 1 plants. The best variables for discriminating okra ecotypes during water deficit are the relative water content (RWC), the length and the number of fruits. Three ecotypes (V 1, V 3 and V 4) are chosen to be used in breeding program of okra for resistance to water deficit...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{genetic control}} of the switch between {{seasonal}} and perpetual flowering has been deciphered in various perennial species. However, {{little is known about}} the genetic {{control of the}} dynamics of perpetual flowering, which changes abruptly at well-defined time instants during the growing season. Here, we characterize the perpetual flowering pattern and identify new genetic controls of this pattern in the cultivated strawberry. Twenty-one perpetual flowering strawberry genotypes were phenotyped at the macroscopic scale for their course of emergence of inflorescences and stolons during the growing season. A longitudinal analysis based on the segmentation of flowering rate profiles using multiple change-point models was conducted. The flowering pattern of perpetual flowering genotypes takes the form of three or four successive phases: an autumn-initiated flowering phase, a flowering pause, and a single stationary perpetual flowering phase or two perpetual <b>flowering</b> <b>phases,</b> the second one being more intense. The genetic control of flowering was analysed by quantitative trait locus mapping of flowering traits based on these <b>flowering</b> <b>phases.</b> We showed that the occurrence of a fourth phase of intense flowering is controlled by a newly identified locus, different from the locus FaPFRU, controlling the switch between seasonal and perpetual flowering behaviour.

40|$|Heracleum mantegazzianum {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{invasive}} species in the Czech flora. The present study describes its flowering phenology and assess the effectiveness of protandry in preventing selfing in this self-compatible species, describes the timing of flowering in a heavily invaded area of Slavkovský les (Czech Republic) and estimates fruit set in a large sample of plants, which provides reliable data on the often exaggerated fecundity of this species. The study of flowering phenology revealed that protandry is always effective only within individual flowers, where male and female <b>flowering</b> <b>phases</b> are completely separated. In contrast, anther dehiscence in some flowers can occasionally overlap with stigma receptivity in other flowers in the same umbel, providing an opportunity for geitono-gamous (i. e. between-flower) selfing. Nevertheless, the potential for selfing in H. mantegazzianum is determined mainly by an overlap in the male and female <b>flowering</b> <b>phases</b> between umbels on the same plant; at least a short overlap between some umbels was observed in 99 % of the plants at the Slavkovský les. Although the degree of protandry in H. mantegazzianum favours outcrossing, the op-portunity to self may be of crucial importance for an invasive plant, especially if a single plant colo-nizes a new location.

Some transgenic plants containing extra copies of CO flowered earlier than wild type, suggesting that CO activity is limiting on flowering time.

A significantly longer vegetative phase was found in Montenegrin accessions in comparison to the other groups of origin. Duration of the vegetative phase was significantly and positively correlated to tuber mass and negatively to their number, while duration of the reproductive phase had an opposite effect. For further work on topinambour breeding, it would be important to describe the mechanism of photoperiodic control of flowering initialization.

The analysis of variance revealed highly significant (P< 0. 05 or 0. 01) differences for all the characters studied, indicating the presence of substantial genetic variability. The phenotypic co-efficient of variation (PCV) was higher than genotypic co-efficient of variation (GCV) for all the characters studied, this shows the influence of the environmental effect on the characters.

The studies of the quantity of agronomically valuable groups of microorganisms with PolyFunKur in the tillering phase revealed that eight of nine groups had increased their quantity from 0. 3 to 1. 8 times over the control; only cellulose–destroying aerobic microorganisms had decreased their quantity in 3. 5 times under the control.

The flowering phenophases and pollen seasons were studied in 2008 – 2011. Phenological observations of flowering were conducted in the Maria Curie-Skłodowska University Botanical Garden in Lublin and they involved the following taxa: Alnus crispa var. mollis, A. glutinosa, A. incana, A. incana ‘Aurea’, A. incana ‘Pendula’, A. maximowiczii, A. rubra and A. subcordata. Spearman’s r correlation coefficients were calculated in order to determine the relationship between the dynamics of inflorescence development and meteorological conditions. Aerobiological monitoring using the gravimetric method was employed in the determination of Alnus pollen content in the air. The annual phenological cycles in 2008 - 2011 varied distinctly in terms of the time of onset of successive <b>flowering</b> <b>phases</b> in the Alnus taxa studied, which depended largely on the taxonomic rank and meteorological factors. The following flowering sequence was revealed in the 2008 - 2011 growing seasons: A. subcordata (December or January), A. incana ‘Pendula’, A. incana, A. maximowiczii, A. rubra, A. glutinosa, A. incana ‘Aurea’ (February or March), and A. crispa var. mollis (April). The study demonstrated that the pollen of the taxa persisted in the air, on average, from mid-December to early May. The mean length of the flowering period, which coincided with various phases of the pollen season, was 17 days. The Alnus pollen season in 2008 started at the end of January and lasted until mid-March.

Most plants (except auto flowering strains that flower independently of photoperiod) begin to flower under diminishing light. In nature, cannabis plants sense the forthcoming winter as the Earth revolves about the Sun and daylight reduces in duration (see also season). If females are not pollinated (fertilized by male pollen) they start to produce buds that contain sticky white resin glands or trichomes in a final attempt for pollination by windborne male pollen. The trichomes produce resins that contain the largest amounts of THC and CBN, the two main psychoactive substances. Fertilized females continue to produce resinous trichomes but more plant energy is consumed by the production of seeds, which can be half the mass of a fertilized bract; thus, to maximize resin per gram, infertile cultivation is preferred.Inflorescence that produce no seeds are called sin semilla (which translates to [...] "without seeds" [...] in Spanish, and is often misspelled as one word).
