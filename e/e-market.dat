The review of the literature has revealed that one of the main obstacles to developing <b>e-marketing</b> potential is the absence of a clear conceptualisation of <b>e-marketing</b> purpose and definition. The majority of researchers within the field misuse the term <b>e-marketing</b> and are using the terms e-business, <b>e-marketing,</b> e-commerce and Internet-marketing interchangeably as if they are similar or have the same meaning, which is incorrect. For example, <b>e-marketing</b> is broader in scope than Internet marketing since it refers not only to digital media such as the Web, e-mail, and wireless media, but also includes electronic customer relationship management systems and the management of digital customer data, etc. In contrast, e-commerce and e-business have a wider and broader scope than <b>e-marketing.</b> The differences between these terms as well as the main components of <b>e-marketing</b> are illustrated and discussed in detail within the chapter towards achieving a conceptualisation of <b>e-marketing</b> as a new marketing philosophy and to build a ground base of understanding for these different concepts.

40|$|From an {{analysis}} of the literature it is apparent that there has been no concerted effort to date to undertake a coherent and integrated assessment of the application of <b>e-marketing</b> in sport mega-events. A strategic evaluation of the <b>e-marketing</b> initiatives implemented since 2000 during national and international mega events, indicates that <b>e-marketing,</b> in most instances, took place in a limited and fragmented manner. However a further analysis of these case studies provides valuable perspectives and lessons that could inform the research process related to <b>e-marketing</b> during the 2010 FIFA Soccer World CupTM. Against this background each of the selected sport mega-events since 2000 was investigated in terms of how <b>e-marketing</b> technology was used in the particular event, the <b>e-marketing</b> challenges experienced, the key <b>e-marketing</b> lessons learnt and the apparent <b>e-marketing</b> critical success factors related to these events. The theoretical context and the lessons learnt from previous mega-event case studies provided the background and frame of reference for the empirical research into the use of <b>e-marketing</b> during the 2010 Soccer World CupTM. The key envisaged outcome was to theoretically develop an <b>e-marketing</b> framework that can serve as a guideline to fully optimise <b>e-marketing</b> in future sports mega-events.

40|$|An {{electronic}} market (<b>e-Market)</b> is an internet-based information {{system that allows}} buyers and sellers to exchange goods, services or information online. It has been becoming increasingly popular due to its potential benefits to business, especially to small-and-medium sized enterprises (SMEs), including strengthened customer relationships, ease of reaching targeted markets, improved efficiency, reduced costs, and greater competitive advantages. The potential of <b>e-Market</b> for Australian SMEs, however, has not been fully utilized. A majority of Australian SMEs have not made use of an <b>e-Market,</b> {{and those who have}} adopted <b>e-Market</b> have not moved beyond the entry-level adoption. This study aims to provide Australian SMEs with an integrated solution for successfully conducting their electronic business. Such a solution includes (a) the identification of the emerging patterns and the critical determinants for the adoption of <b>e-Market</b> in Australian SMEs and (b) the development of an effective approach for the evaluation and selection of the most appropriate <b>e-Market</b> for electronic business in a given situation. To adequately achieve the objectives above, this study adopts a two-stage approach. In the first stage, a mixed-method approach is used for investigating the emerging patterns and the critical determinants for the adoption of <b>e-Market</b> in Australian SMEs. Through using survey and interview, a proposed model is tested and validated for the adoption of <b>e-Market</b> in Australian SMEs within the technology-organization-environment framework using structural equation modelling and logistic regression analysis. In the second stage, an effective approach is developed by integrating data envelopment analysis, multi-criteria analysis, and fuzzy logic for effectively assisting SMEs in their evaluation and selection of the most appropriate <b>e-Market</b> for electronic business. The study shows a positive relationship between the perceived direct benefit, top management support, external pressure, perceived trust and the adoption of <b>e-Market</b> in Australian SMEs. Furthermore it also shows that the perceived indirect benefit and the organization readiness are insignificant to the adoption of <b>e-Market.</b> This leads to the development of an alternative model for better understanding the underlying reasons for such insignificant relationships by considering the indirect influence of the determinants on the adoption of <b>e-Market.</b> Such a model confirms that the perceived direct benefit, perceived trust and external pressure are critical for affecting the top management’s decision in <b>e-Market</b> adoption in Australian SMEs. This study makes a major contribution to the <b>e-Market</b> research from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Theoretically the study develops a validated model for better understanding the adoption of <b>e-Market</b> in Australian SMEs and provides SMEs with an effective approach for their selection of the most appropriate <b>e-Market</b> for electronic business. Practically, the study leads to several major findings which are valuable to various stakeholders in electronic business. Specifically those findings can (a) help government departments formulate specific policies and strategies in electronic business for SMEs, (b) provide SMEs with useful information and guidelines for assisting the development of doable strategies for successfully participating in <b>e-Market,</b> and (c) offer <b>e-Market</b> operators useful information for developing sustainable <b>e-Market</b> in an increasingly competitive online environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} an agent {{mediated}} <b>e-market</b> system {{lies in the}} underlying reputation management system {{to improve the quality}} of services in an information asymmetric <b>e-market.</b> Reputation provides an operatable metric for establishing trustworthiness between mutually unknown online entities. Reputation systems encourage honest behaviour and discourage malicious behaviour of participating agents in the <b>e-market.</b> A dynamic reputation model would provide virtually instantaneous knowledge about the changing <b>e-market</b> environment and would utilise Internets' capacity for continuous interactivity for reputation computation. This paper proposes a dynamic reputation framework using reinforcement learning and fuzzy set theory that ensures judicious use of information sharing for inter-agent cooperation. This framework is sensitive to the changing parameters of <b>e-market</b> like the value of transaction and the varying experience of agents with the purpose of improving inbuilt defense mechanism of the reputation system against various attacks so that <b>e-market</b> reaches an equilibrium state and dishonest agents are weeded out of the market.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the wars between the upstart Internet {{retailers}} and the existing bricks-and-mortar retailers, many <b>e-marketing</b> techniques were invented. This article develops a single unifying and theoretically based taxonomy for <b>e-marketing</b> techniques: the <b>e-marketing</b> mix. Drawing on the paradigms of exchange, relationships, and digital interactions in networks, 11 <b>e-marketing</b> functions are identified that form the elements of the <b>e-marketing</b> mix. Nine of the 11 <b>e-marketing</b> functions are considered basic, while 7 functions moderate the effects of others and are termed overlapping. The 11 <b>e-marketing</b> functions provide a categorization of the <b>e-marketing</b> techniques. Compared to the conventional marketing mix, the <b>e-marketing</b> mix has more overlapping elements and directly represents personalization, an aspect of segmentation, as a basic function. The existence of multiple elements that are basic and overlapping in the <b>e-marketing</b> mix indicates that integration across elements should be more commonplace compared to the traditional marketing mix. In the 5 -year period beginning about April 1995 and ending in April 2000, an era known as the dot. com boom, hundreds of businesses that used the Internet as a primary means of transacting with consumers (e-tailers) were taken to initial public offerings (IPO).

To study the equilibrium of a buyer-seller exchange network {{before and after the}} emergence of e-marketplaces, we develop a multiple-person noncooperative game, where rational firms select optimal interfirm connections and the network is endogenously formed and evolved. We examine when previous buyer-seller relationships exist, under what conditions both neutral and biased B 2 B e-markets will sustain in both the oligopoly market and the oligopsony market. Our analysis identifies critical success factors for a sustainable e-marketplace. First, low <b>e-market</b> channel setup costs are critical to attract firms ’ participation. Second, the number of buyers and sellers affects the sustainability of B 2 B e-markets. For a neutral e-marketplace to survive, high fragmentation is required on both sides. For a biased <b>e-market,</b> how the number of firms on the non-owner side influences the <b>e-market</b> equilibrium depends on market competition. Third, in both the oligopoly market and the oligopsony market, a neutral <b>e-market</b> has similar equilibrium conditions. By contrast, market competition has a profound impact on the formation of a biased <b>e-market.</b> The biased <b>e-market</b> formed by the more competitive side is less likely to survive. Finally, we show that social welfare is improved with the emergence of a neutral e-marketplace, but the change is ambiguous in a biased B 2 B e-marketplace case. * Corresponding author...|$|E
