25|$|During {{refuelling}} {{operations on}} Reactor 2, an irradiated <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> failed to {{release from the}} grab (this is used to hold an element while it is withdrawn from a reactor). Routine methods were used to release the grab. However, the irradiated <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> snagged during the operation and was lifted out of its shielding resulting in the operators on the pile cap being exposed to the intense radiation being emitted from the irradiated <b>fuel</b> <b>element.</b> Personnel responded quickly, and the radiological dose they received was small.|$|E

25|$|A nuclear {{meltdown}} is {{a severe}} nuclear reactor accident {{that results in}} reactor core damage from overheating. It {{has been defined as}} the accidental melting of the core of a nuclear reactor, and refers to the core's either complete or partial collapse. A core melt accident occurs when the heat generated by a nuclear reactor exceeds the heat removed by the cooling systems to the point where at least one nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> exceeds its melting point. This differs from a <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> failure, which is not caused by high temperatures. A meltdown may be caused by a loss of coolant, loss of coolant pressure, or low coolant flow rate or be the result of a criticality excursion in which the reactor is operated at a power level that exceeds its design limits. Alternately, in a reactor plant such as the RBMK-1000, an external fire may endanger the core, leading to a meltdown.|$|E
40|$|A {{nondestructive}} {{autoradiographic technique}} is described which {{can provide a}} verification of the piece count and the plutonium content of plutonium-containing <b>fuel</b> <b>elements.</b> This technique uses the spontaneously emitted gamma rays from plutonium to form images of <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> on photographic film.

40|$|The {{transition}} of the NBSR from HEU to LEU fuel is challenging due to reactivity constraints {{and the need}} to maintain an uninterrupted science program, the mission of the NBSR. The transition cannot occur with a full change of HEU to LEU <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> since the excess reactivity would be large enough that the NBSR would violate the technical specification for shutdown margin. Manufacturing LEU <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> to represent irradiated <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> would be cost prohibitive since 26 one-of-a-kind <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> would need to be manufactured. For this report a gradual transition from the present HEU fuel to the proposed LEU fuel was studied. The gradual change approach would follow the present fuel management scheme and replace four HEU <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> with four LEU <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> each cycle.

25|$|Not all {{reactors}} {{need to be}} {{shut down}} for refueling; for example, pebble bed reactors, RBMK reactors, molten salt reactors, Magnox, AGR and CANDU reactors allow fuel to be shifted through the reactor while it is running.

25|$|Fuel in {{a single}} channel in Reactor 2 that was loaded with fuel {{elements}} under evaluation for the commercial reactor programme experienced a partial blockage, attributed {{to the presence of}} graphite debris (see <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> failure).

25|$|No {{enrichment}} and <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> fabrication. Since 100% {{of natural}} thorium {{can be used}} as a fuel, and the fuel is in the form of a molten salt instead of solid fuel rods, expensive fuel enrichment and solid fuel rods' validation procedures and fabricating processes are not needed. This greatly decreases LFTR fuel costs. Even if the LFTR is started up on enriched uranium, it only needs this enrichment once just to get started. After startup, no further enrichment is required.|$|E
25|$|For the {{propulsion}} of the studied vehicles, Bob Lazar {{claims that}} the atomic Element 115 served as a nuclear <b>fuel.</b> <b>Element</b> 115 (provisionally named 'Ununpentium' (Uup)) reportedly provided an energy source which would produce anti-gravity effects under proton bombardment along with the production of antimatter used for energy production. Lazar's website says that, if the intense strong nuclear force field of element 115's nucleus was properly amplified, the resulting effect would be a distortion of the surrounding gravitational field, allowing the vehicle to immediately shorten the distance to a charted destination.|$|E
25|$|The reactor {{emergency}} {{protection system}} (EPS) {{was designed to}} shut down the reactor when its operational parameters are exceeded. The design accounted for steam collapse in the core when the <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> temperature falls below 265Â°C, coolant vaporization in fuel channels in cold reactor state, and sticking of some emergency protection rods. However, the slow insertion speed of the control rods, together with their design causing localized positive reactivity as the displacer moves through {{the lower part of the}} core, created a number of possible situations where initiation of the EPS could itself cause or aggravate a reactor runaway.|$|E

5000|$|A marine nuclear {{propulsion}} plant must {{be designed to}} be highly reliable and self-sufficient, requiring minimal maintenance and repairs, which {{might have to be}} undertaken many thousands of miles from its home port. One of the technical difficulties in designing <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> for a seagoing nuclear reactor is the creation of <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> which will withstand a large amount of radiation damage. <b>Fuel</b> <b>elements</b> may crack over time and gas bubbles may form. The fuel used in marine reactors is a metal-zirconium alloy rather than the ceramic UO2 (uranium oxide) often used in land-based reactors. Marine reactors are designed for long core life, enabled by the relatively high enrichment of the uranium and by incorporating a [...] "burnable poison" [...] in the <b>fuel</b> <b>elements,</b> which is slowly depleted as the <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> age and become less reactive. The gradual dissipation of the [...] "nuclear poison" [...] increases the reactivity of the core to compensate for the lessening reactivity of the aging <b>fuel</b> <b>elements,</b> thereby lengthening the usable life of the fuel. The life of the compact reactor pressure vessel is extended by providing an internal neutron shield, which reduces the damage to the steel from constant bombardment by neutrons.|$|R

40|$|The {{verification}} of the subcriticality {{is of utmost}} importance for the safe transportation and storage of nuclear reactor fuels. Transportation containers and storage facilities are designed such that nuclear fuels remain in a subcritical state.

A joint experimental research program between Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Westinghouse Safety Management Solutions, Inc., and the University of Missouri was initiated to obtain measured quantities that could be directly related to the subcriticality of simple arrays of Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR) <b>fuel</b> <b>elements.</b> A series of measurement were performed to assess the reactivity of materials such as BORAL, stainless steel, aluminum, and lead that are typically used in the construction of shipping casks.

The results of these measurements were used by Westinghouse Safety Management Solutions to determine the subcriticality of MURR <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> isolated by absorbing materials.

40|$|AbstractThe fuel of HTGR {{is made of}} some spherical <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> with {{diameter}} of 60 mm. The cask of fresh fuel is used to temporarily store and transport such a kind of new spherical <b>fuel</b> <b>elements,</b> and it may drop during transport. The dropping process can be simulated by two ways. The first is the coupled Euler-Lagrange (CEL) method, in which the new <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> are taking as fluid and can be considered explicitly. The second {{is referred to as}} the equivalent mass method. In the method, the cask and the new fuel are not considered individually, and the mass of the new <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> is averagely allocated to the bottom head of the cask. The simulating result shows that the CEL method can describe the flow and inertial effects of the new <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> in the dropping process, and the lateral fluid dynamic pressure generated by <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> to the cask. The impact effect can be fully considered in the equivalent mass method. Results show that the impact force is stronger and the contact time is shorter than that of the CEL method. Finally, parameters of equivalent fluid in the CEL method are discussed. And the results show that the fluid model is reasonable. In one word, calculation results of the two methods can be combined in structural design, which will give a more reasonable design...|$|R
