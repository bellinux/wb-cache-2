40|$|Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a nephrotoxic and {{carcinogenic}} mycotoxin, {{a secondary}} metabolite produced by mould fungi belonging to several Aspergillus and Penicillium species. It is formed during {{the storage of}} cereal grains and other plant-derived products. OTA ingested by humans and animals with the food or feed may exert deleterious effects on health. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the ochratoxin contamination of the most important potential sources of OTA. The OTA content of cereal samples for human consumption (36 baking wheat, 16 wheat flour and 6 maize coarse meal samples) and feed grain samples (30 <b>feeding</b> <b>wheat,</b> 32 feeding maize and 20 feeding barley samples) collected in the mid-phase or at the end of the storage period and of 50 commercial coffee samples was determined. The analyses were performed by immunoaffinity column - high-performance liquid chromatography (IAC-HPLC). The limit of detection of the method was 0. 1 ng/g. Of the wheat samples intended for human consumption, 8. 3 % contained OTA at 0. 29 ng/g on the average (OTA ranges: 0. 12 - 0. 5 ng/g; Table 2). The OTA contamination of wheat flour and maize meal samples for human consumption was similar to that of the baking wheat samples. OTA contamination was found in 26. 7 % of the <b>feeding</b> <b>wheat,</b> 15. 6 % of the feeding maize and 35 % of the feeding barley samples. The average values and the ranges of OTA levels found in the above samples were 12. 2 and 0. 3 - 62. 8 ng/g, 4. 9 and 1. 9 - 8. 3 ng/g, and 72 and 0. 14 - 212 ng/g, respectively (Table 3). Sixty-six percent of the coffee samples were contaminated with OA (average level: 0. 57 ng/g, ranges: 0. 17 - 1. 3 ng/g; Table 4). OTA contamination of baking wheat samples was found to be relatively low, presumably as a result of the favourable weather at harvest and the optimal storage conditions. Calculations made on the basis of the obtained results show that the daily OTA intake of an adult human from edible cereals is only 6. 7 ng, while the amount taken up with coffee is 4. 1 ng daily. The high prevalence and high levels of OTA contamination in feed grains can be explained by the unfavourable storage conditions, and this finding suggests that OA-related health problems may arise in animals, and that foods of animal origin may be contaminated with this mycotoxin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Leucine (Leu) regulates muscle protein {{synthesis}} (MPS) producing dose-dependent plasma Leu and MPS responses from {{free amino acid}} solutions. This study examined the role of Leu content from dietary proteins in regulation of MPS after complete meals. Methods Experiment 1 examined 4 protein sources (wheat, soy, egg, and whey) with different Leu concentrations (6. 8, 8. 0, 8. 8, and 10. 9 % (w/w), respectively) on the potential to increase plasma Leu, activate translation factors, and stimulate MPS. Male rats (~ 250 [*]g) were trained for 14 day to eat 3 meals/day consisting of 16 / 54 / 30 % of energy from protein, carbohydrates and fats. Rats were killed on d 14 either before or 90 [*]min after consuming a 4 [*]g breakfast meal. Experiment 2 compared <b>feeding</b> <b>wheat,</b> whey, and wheat + Leu to determine if supplementing the Leu content of the wheat meal would yield similar anabolic responses as whey. Results In Experiment 1, only whey and egg groups increased post-prandial plasma Leu and stimulated MPS above food-deprived controls. Likewise, greater phosphorylation of p 70 S 6 kinase 1 (S 6 K 1) and 4 E binding protein- 1 (4 E-BP 1) occurred in whey and egg groups versus wheat and soy groups. Experiment 2 demonstrated that supplementing wheat with Leu to equalize the Leu content of the meal also equalized the rates of MPS. Conclusion These findings demonstrate that Leu content is a critical factor for evaluating {{the quantity and quality}} of proteins necessary at a meal for stimulation of MPS. </p...|$|E

Eighty, 1 -d-old ROSS 308 broiler chicks of both sexes were used in the experiment. All birds received the control diet for two weeks and then they were fed experimental diets for two more weeks. The 4 diets included the following: 1.) negative control diet (0. 1 mg DON/kg diet; 0. 005 mg ZEA/kg diet), 2.) positive control diet (0. 1 mg DON/kg diet, 0. 005 mg ZEA/kg diet + 0. 5 % lignin), 3.) mycotoxin-contaminated diet (2. 95 mg DON/kg diet, 1. 59 mg ZEA/kg diet) and 4.) mycotoxincontaminated diet with the addition of lignin at 0. 5 % of the diet (2. 95 mg DON/kg diet, 1. 59 mg ZEA/kg diet + 0. 5 % lignin). The feeding of contaminated wheat did not significantly affect parameters of mineral metabolism, including calcium, chlorides and phosphorus. Decreased levels of total protein, albumin and potassium were observed. However, dietary supplementation with lignin prevented this effect. Plasma triglycerides and free glycerol levels were not affected by dietary treatments. There was a significant increase in aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities and magnesium and cholesterol levels in plasma from birds fed contaminated wheat. Inclusion of lignin in the diet reversed elevated alkaline phosphatase activity in chicks induced by mycotoxin-contaminated diet.

40|$|The {{effects of}} grain and carbohydrase enzyme supplementation were {{investigated}} on digestive physiology of chickens. A total of 625 one-day-old chicks (Ross 308) {{were randomly assigned}} to five treatments in a completely randomized design. Treatments included two different types of grains (wheat, and barley) with or without a multi-carbohydrase supplement. A corn-based diet was also considered to serve as a control. Feeding barley-based diet with multi-carbohydrase led to higher feed intake (P < 0. 01) than those fed corn- and wheat-based diets. Birds fed on barley and wheat diets had lower weight gain despite a higher feed conversion ratio (P < 0. 01). Total count and number of different type of bacteria including Gram-negative, E. coli, and Clostridia increased after <b>feeding</b> <b>wheat</b> and barley but the number of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria decreased (P < 0. 01). Feeding barley and wheat diets reduced villus height {{in different parts of the}} small intestine when compared to those fed on a corn diet. However, enzyme supplementation of barley and wheat diets improved weight gain and feed conversion ratio and resulted in reduced number of E. coli and Clostridia and increased number of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, and also restored the negative effects on intestinal villi height (P < 0. 01). The activities of pancreatic α-amylase and lipase were (P < 0. 01) increased in chickens fed wheat and barley diets when compared to the control fed on a corn diet.

Therefore, {{there is a growing}} need to improve the feeding value of locally available resources such as wheat straw for supplementary <b>feeding.</b> <b>Wheat</b> straw constitutes an important source of roughage for ruminants. It typically contain more than 70 % neutral detergent fiber (NDF) on a dry matter (DM) basis, with less than 40 % total digestive tract digestibility of the NDF, even under ideal feeding conditions (NRC 2001). The objective {{of this study was to}} determine effects of xylanase on in vitro gas production (GP) and in sacco degradability of wheat straw. Rumen fluid was obtained from three Mongolian native goats fitted with permanent rumen cannulas. The trial consisted of five doses (0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 μL/g of substrate) of a commercial xylanase (Dyadic® xylanase PLUS, Dyadic International, Inc., Jupiter, FL, USA). For the in sacco degradability, different levels of xylanase enzyme were added directly onto 2 g of wheat straw in nylon bags and incubated in the rumen for 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h to estimate degradability of wheat straw. Total GP increased (P < 0. 001) at all times of incubation at intermediate levels of xylanase. Methane production had a similar pattern at 3 and 12 h of incubation; increased linearly at 24 h of incubation, and was unaffected at 6 and 48 h of incubation. Rumen NH 3 -N concentration increased linearly at 3 h and the highest values were observed with intermediate enzyme levels. All ruminal volatile fatty acids increased linearly with intermediate levels of the fibrolytic enzyme.

Two experimental variants for feed were evaluated: dipped wheat grain and crushed wheat grain. The feed dose for wheat was 1. 5 % of the fish stock weight and for natural food (frozen Chironomid larvae) was 0. 2 % of fish stock weight to all variants. Growth parameters (body length, body weight, Fulton's condition factor and feed conversion ratio) of the fish were evaluated after one month of administration. The feed consumption and physico-chemical parameters (temperature, oxygen saturation, pH, N-NH 4 +, N-NO 2 -, N-NO 3 - and Cl -) of the environment were observed. During the feeding test, no major differences in food consumption among variations feeding on either wheat and on Chironomid larvae were noted.

Experiment 1 tested increasing soybean hulls (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 %) and increasing soybean hulls decreased ADG and G:F. Experiment 2 evaluated increasing soybean hulls (0, 10, and 20 %) in diets balanced or not for NE and showed reduced performance with increasing soybean hulls. Balancing for NE resulted in G:F similar to pigs fed the control. Experiments 3 and 4 evaluated increasing dietary soybean hulls in corn-soybean meal and corn-soybean meal-DDGS diets. Soybean hulls in either diet worsened G:F and improved caloric efficiency, suggesting current INRA (2004) values for soybean hulls underestimate their energy value. Experiment 5 evaluated 10 and 20 % ground or unground soybean hulls in meal and pelleted diets. Caloric efficiency improved {{with high levels of}} soybean hulls. Pelleting improved ADG and eliminated negative effects on G:F with increasing soybean hulls, while grinding soybean hulls reduced performance. Experiment 6 tested increasing ground and unground soybean hulls (0, 7. 5, and 15 %). Increasing soybean hulls worsened G:F, carcass yield, and hot carcass weight. Grinding soybean hulls to finer particle sizes did not improve ADG and worsened G:F. Experiments 7 and 8 evaluated the replacement of corn with wheat and crystalline amino acids in nursery and finishing pig diets.

Treatments included two different types of cereal grains (wheat, and barley) with or without an enzyme supplementation along with a corn-based diet as control group. The experimental diets were formulated to have similar contents of crude protein, metabolizable energy, total non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and were fed in two periods of starter and grower. Experimental traits were consisted growth performance, ileal flora numeration, villus morphology in 3 parts of the intestine, digesta viscosity and pancreatic enzyme activity, and determining the gene expression level of glucose transporter (SGLT 1) and mucin producer (MUC 2) in the jejunum. Results indicated that inclusion of wheat and barley to corn-soy based diet with or without exo-enzymes blend on growth performance traits were significant (p< 0. 01). Feed intake and average daily gain in wheat diet was lower, conversely FCR was higher than other groups (p< 0. 01). Maximum microbial count were observed in wheat and barley diets and minimum were observed in enzyme supplemented diets respectively (p< 0. 01). Control group and enzyme supplemented diets had minimum counting of gram negative, coliform and clostridium, but maximum counting of lactobacilli and bifidobacter were observed in enzyme supplemented diets (p< 0. 01). Viscosity and activities of pancreatic a-amylase and lipase were significantly increased in chicks fed wheat and barley when compared to the control group fed on corn (p< 0. 01). <b>Feeding</b> <b>wheat</b> and barley diets reduced villus height {{in different parts of the}} small intestine when compared to those fed on a corn diet (p< 0. 01).

In this experiment, each experimental levels of feedstuff was used at 0 (control group), 15, 30 and 45 %. In addition, their apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn) was determined by Sibbald’s method. Daily feed intake of chicks fed by diets containing macaroni wastes and grade 1 <b>wheat</b> <b>feed</b> screening for 21 to 56 days of age was significantly lower than that {{in the control group}} (P&lt; 0. 05). In contrast, body weight, daily weight gain and feed conversion had no significant differences during this period. However, in the total experimental period, the best feed conversion belonged to chicks fed with various levels of macaroni wastes and grade 1 <b>wheat</b> <b>feed</b> screening. Apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn) of macaroni wastes and <b>wheat</b> <b>feed</b> screening were 3700, 3270, and 2870 kcal/kg, respectively. According to the results of this experiment, it is possible to use macaroni wastes and grade 1 <b>wheat</b> <b>feed</b> screening at 45 % and 30 % levels in the diet of broiler chicks, respectively, without any undesirable effects on their performance...|$|R
40|$|With {{the future}} {{prospect}} of {{increased levels of}} resistance in pest populations {{there is a need}} to use longer exposures for phosphine fumigation of commodities to retain treatment efficacy. Trials in grain bins and on floor-stored grain have shown that it is possible to maintain adequate concentrations of gas throughout the bulk for lengthy periods using phosphine in carbon dioxide from cylinders. An automated dosing system for cylinder-based phosphine has been developed and tested by the Central Science Laboratory. The performance of the dosing system was compared with the SirofloR system that has been developed by CSIRO in Australia. Both systems were tested in a silo containing 700 tonnes of <b>feed</b> <b>wheat</b> and in a floor store containing 150 tonnes of <b>feed</b> <b>wheat.</b> The automated dosing system coupled with re-circulation gave comparable results to the SirofloR system. It may not be possible to maintain an even gas distribution using the automated dosing system without circulation in windy weather or during times of widely fluctuating diurnal temperatures. An alternative to phosphine for grain treatments developed at CSL is the use of the exhaust gas from propane combustion, using a purpose-designed self-cooling burner. Bins of 1000 tonne capacity can be disinfested at a fuel cost of less than 50 p per tonne. Current research is indicating that although very low levels (< 1 %) of oxygen are required to kill insects, somewhat higher levels can be effective at preventing breeding and reinfestation. A new approach to storage life protection could involve storage under modified atmospheres...|$|R
30|$|House fly larvae {{provide a}} {{prolific}} and sustainable source of proteins used in poultry and fish <b>feed.</b> <b>Wheat</b> bran is a superior diet for house fly larvae {{and has been}} widely investigated to exploit its potential in the food and feed area. Using Illumina MiSeq 16 S rDNA sequencing, this study investigated the gut microbiota of house fly larvae <b>feeding</b> on <b>wheat</b> bran and the bacterial community in the wheat bran. The bacterial communities in the house fly larvae were dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Enterobacteriaceae and Providencia were the predominant bacteria at the family and genus levels, respectively. Some bacteria in the phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes may be transferred from the gut of house flies to the <b>wheat</b> bran during <b>feeding</b> and {{may be involved in}} degrading and utilizing polysaccharides in the cell wall of wheat bran. The significance of the gut microbiota of house fly larvae, their transferring and roles in degradation of wheat bran is discussed. These findings regarding the gut microbiota of house fly larvae will provide opportunities for research on the impact of microbial communities on poultry and fish.|$|R
40|$|Over the years, Utah {{has enjoyed}} the {{advantage}} of having natural agricultural resources that favor the production of livestock. Sheep and beef cattle do well on the desert and high mountain ranges that cover much of the state, Dairy cattle and wintering beef cattle use the alfalfa and native hay along with some corn silage that is grown in the irrigated valleys. Feed grains are grown in rotation with forage crops on irrigated land and also on dry land. Before 1950, the quantities of feed grains produced had been sufficient {{to meet the needs}} of dairy, range livestock and poultry. However, with the realization that Utah had a natural market position in relation to the coast markets, there developed an extensive poultry and livestock fattening business. Since that time Utah has been in the position of a feed grain deficit state. This has tended to raise the cost of feed grain by 10 to 12 per ton due to the transportation factor. Also, Utah 2 ̆ 7 s poultry industry relied partially upon <b>feed</b> <b>wheat</b> from northern Utah and southern Idaho, but with acreage allotments and price controls, the price of wheat increased to the point where it was no longer used as a poultry feed. As a consequence, poultry and egg producers also had to turn to importing more of their feed grains, which put them into a higher feed cost position along with the livestock feeder. In the past year, however, the price of <b>feed</b> <b>wheat</b> declined to the point where wheat was used extensively in livestock feed stuffs for the first time in years...|$|R
40|$|Of 7 winter wheats {{grown at}} 3 sites in {{southern}} England in 2001, the highest yielding was the soft wheat Claire; the breadmaking varieties Hereward, Shamrock and Spark did well. Of the <b>feed</b> <b>wheats,</b> Aardvark outyielded Deben. Of various variety mixtures tried, Aardvark/Claire/Deben was highest yielding. When seed was saved from the 2000 harvest of Hereward/Malacca/Shamrock and grown in 2001, it outyielded {{the first generation}} mixture, suggesting that some adaptation had occurred, relative composition changing {{in response to the}} local conditions. Winter oats and triticale were trialled at one site in Berkshire. The triticales Ego and Fidelio performed well, as did the winter oat Kingfisher. The oat mixture Ego/Fidelio/Taurus outyielded the mean of its component varieties. The triticale mixture Ego/Fidelio/Taurus showed adaptation from 2000 to 2001. ...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{extrusion}} {{parameters and}} raw materials on extrudate expansion are respectively investigated in a twin-screw extruder and a single-screw extruder extrusion cooking experiments for fish <b>feed,</b> <b>wheat,</b> and oat & wheat mixture processing. A new phenomenological model is proposed to correlated extrudate bulk density, extrusion parameters and raw material changes based on the experimental results. The average absolute deviation (AAD) of the correlation is 2. 2 % for fish feed extrusion in the twin-screw extrusion process. For the single-screw extrusion process, the correlation AAD is respectively 3. 03 %, 5. 14 % for wheat and oat & wheat mixture extrusion; and the correlation AAD is 6. 6 % for raw material change effects. The correlation results demonstrate that the proposed equation {{can be used to}} calculate extrudate bulk density for both the twin-screw extruder and the single-screw extruder extrusion cooking processes...|$|R
40|$|S hochu {{distillery}} by-product (SDBP) {{was applied}} for culturing the common carp Cyprinus carpio L. Four experimental diets were formulated by mixing commercial fish <b>feed</b> and <b>wheat</b> flour with SDBP (I) and supplementing it either with vitamins (II), fish oil (III), or both (IV). A control diet contained only commercial fish <b>feed</b> and <b>wheat</b> flour. These diets were fed to the fish twice daily for 40 days to estimate weight gain (WG), feed intake (FI), food conversion ratio (FCR) and specific growth rate (SGR). All fish gained weight increments after the feeding experiment, but with {{no significant difference in}} FI among the diets except for diet III. Fish fed with diet III had low FCR and SGR, i. e., their growth retardation. However, SDBP might be used as a supplement for fish feed to foster the growth of fish...|$|R
