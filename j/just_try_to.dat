500|$|In essence, the Hymns for the Amusement of Children is {{intended}} to teach children the specific virtues {{that make up the}} subject matter of the work. While trying to accomplish this goal, Smart emphasizes the joy of creation and Christ's sacrifice that allowed for future salvation. However, he didn't <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> spread joy, but structured his poems to treat valuable lessons about morality; his subjects begin with the three Theological Virtues (Faith, Hope, and Charity), then the four Cardinal Virtues (Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude) and adds Mercy. The next six hymns deal with Christian duties and are followed by ten hymns on the Gospels.

[...] His coach, Ken Doherty, described Fonville as [...] "one of the hardest working, most studious athletes" [...] he had ever coached. Doherty also added that Fonville's technique distinguished him from most shot putters: [...] "Fonville drives completely across the ring in one continuous motion. Previously, most shotputters made their initial hop and hesitated before their final drive. ... Any track coach looking at him, would recognize all the points of good form.

500|$|A Hollywood executive, not {{involved}} with the film, felt it succeeded because it [...] "has a self-deprecating tone that’s riotous. It’s never been done before. It’s poking fun at Marvel.

[...] James Gunn, director of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, refuted this and said Deadpool was a success because [...] "it’s original, it’s damn good ... and it wasn’t afraid to take risks".

After Fox's Logan (2017) also became a success, Forbes Paul Tassi reiterated Gunn's sentiments, saying the rating was [...] "appropriate given the 'adult' nature of these two heroes", but [...] "too much stock is being put into unrestrained violence rather than people examining what actually makes these movies work". Graeme McMillan at The Hollywood Reporter concurred, adding, [...] "Why not take the freedom that comes from that rating and try to re-approach the mainstream genre with that attitude?" ...|$|E

A Christmas ballad, the song was inspired by a scene in the holiday feature film Love Actually (2003), in which someone confesses unrequited love towards another. Critics singled out the track the one that resonates the Wall of Sound the most. The second track, [...] "Underneath the Tree", was written by Clarkson and Kurstin, making it the first time they had co-written a track together. Clarkson remarked: [...] "Greg and I have worked a lot together, but usually I just come in and I just sing. We've never have actually written a song together at this point.

500|$|In September 1994, Levine, {{along with}} Mickey Madden, Jesse Carmichael, and Ryan Dusick, another Brentwood High student, formed garage band Kara's Flowers. The group played their first gig at the Whisky a Go Go, a nightclub in West Hollywood, California, with Levine on vocals and guitar. In 1997, {{the band was}} {{discovered}} while they were performing at a beach party in Malibu by independent producer Tommy Allen. Allen, along with his partner John DeNicola, had the band record an 11-track album. Owing to a string of industry showcases in Los Angeles, they were signed on to Reprise Records through producer Rob Cavallo. In 1997, Kara's Flowers released their first album, titled The Fourth World. That same year, the band appeared on an episode of the drama series Beverly Hills, 90210. After their graduation, the band toured in support of their debut. Despite high expectations, the album had little success, selling about 5,000 copies, and its only single, [...] "Soap Disco", failed commercially. Finally, on Cavallo's exit from the label, Reprise decided to drop the band. [...] Disappointed {{with the results of}} their album, the band broke up. Later, Levine would say of the experience: [...] "Kara’s Flowers was just floating up the wall beneath the sticks. Make a record quickly, put it out. No touring base, no nothing. <b>Just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make it happen right out of the gate and it just doesn’t work".|$|E

Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set up in my basement, so I <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> finish songs and {{get them out of the}} way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas. We just sift through that stuff, as well as the stuff we do in rehearsal and just pick the best ideas and go. It wasn't like I said I wanted to be a producer or anything, it’s just that the demos I was making came closer to the finished product on one or two occasions, so now, I’m a producer.” ...|$|E
