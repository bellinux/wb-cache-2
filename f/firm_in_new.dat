By the end of 1844 through 1851, the Boston company name was changed to J. H. Bufford & Co. The next, third edition, listed Bufford Lithographer so the third edition must have been printed after the beginning of {{the fall of}} 1844 but before the end of 1844. J. H. Bufford & Co. printed other Ives' games but this third edition of Ives' The Mansion Of Happiness is the only Ives' game to list Bufford Lithographer. Green was again used on one of the litho stones but the end space was a green circle. The other litho stone printed black.|$|E

500|$|According to {{architectural}} historian Willis L. Hall, the church's 20 large {{stained glass}} windows [...] "are as much {{a feature of the}} church as the mosaics". [...] The windows, designed by Frederick Stymetz Lamb (1863–1928) and fabricated by J Lamb Studios, his father's <b>firm</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City, took three years to complete, and eight months to install at Stanford. [...] Jane Stanford hired Lamb because she felt he was more interested in [...] "the ecclesiastical rather than commercial aspect of the work". [...] The installation of the windows at Stanford Memorial Church was the largest enterprise of its kind at the time, and the project {{is considered one of the}} best examples of Lamb's work. [...] Stanford chose the life of Christ for the windows' theme, inspired by the religious paintings by European master painters such as Shields and Doré. [...] Her personal touch is shown in one of the nave windows, which is based on a cartoon by Paoletti and depicts Christ welcoming the soul of a child into Heaven before the eyes of its grieving mother, an allusion to the death of Leland Stanford, Jr., the Stanfords' only child and the university's namesake, who died in 1884 of typhoid shortly before his 16th birthday.|$|E

2500|$|Another dispute {{centers on}} {{funding of the}} Caskey School of Divinity. The Cason Foundation, which had donated $5 million to LC to fund the school, {{announced}} that it will no longer financially support the college because of [...] "actions of President Aguillard which we believe to be unethical and potentially illegal." [...] Edgar D. Cason and his wife, Flora Jean Caskey Cason, of Coushatta in Red River Parish, who established the foundation, informed LC trustees by letter on April 15, 2013, that the foundation was terminating its ties to LC. A probe conducted by a law <b>firm</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Orleans claims that Aguillard had improperly diverted nearly $60,000 in divinity school donations to LC projects in Tanzania, Africa. A committee of five LC board members, however, defended Aguillard and maintain that he did not act improperly regarding the funds. Cason, a wealthy timber operator, farmer, and cattleman, has supported conservative Republican candidates, including Santorum for President, and issues, such as the Louisiana Values Political Action Committee. Cason questioned why the LC trustees did not permit him to address the board at its March meeting.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{performance}} of stock dividend issuing <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Zealand and find that stock dividends provide management with incentives to manipulate earnings. During the sample period of 1989 to 2003, stock dividend issuing firms increase accruals substantially {{in the same year}} followed by poor earnings and stock price performances in the subsequent year. Consistent with the earnings management hypothesis, we find that discretionary accruals of stock dividend issuing <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Zealand are negatively and significantly correlated with the declines in both future earnings and abnormal stock returns. The negative association between discretionary accruals and the abnormal stock returns persists even after we control for the drift effect of earnings and the performance effect on discretionary accruals...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Study {{collects}} panel data of listed <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York Stock and Shanghai Stock Exchanges during 1992 to 2008. The {{data are}} used to perform panel regression estimates for <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> each stock market. The main purpose is to compare the decision on dividend payout of listed <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> the two stock markets. The results from fixed effect estimates show that factors that can explain dividend payout of <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York Stock Exchange poorly explain dividend payout of <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Shanghai Stock Exchange. This paper adds to the literature in that it provides an evidence of difference in dividend policy of firms between advanced and emerging stock markets. For policymakers in the Chinese economy, implementation of measures to enhance the advancement of bond market is necessary. Additionally, <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> Shanghai Stock Exchange should adjust their capital structure to provide room for investors to diversify and adjust their portfolios of stocks and bonds...|$|R
