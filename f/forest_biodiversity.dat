Proper replanting of severely degraded places is often the only remedial action available as natural regeneration has stopped in many places.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{compares the}} {{relative}} levels of <b>forest</b> health and <b>biodiversity</b> in <b>forests</b> managed by three different property rights holders, within a common ecological region of northeastern Newfoundland. The {{objective of the}} research is to understand the influence of forest property rights on <b>forest</b> health and <b>biodiversity</b> in Newfoundland. Five indicators for <b>forest</b> health and <b>biodiversity,</b> drawn from the Western Newfoundland Model Forest's Criteria and Indicators o/ Sustainable Forest Management (1999), serve as an evaluation framework for the research. Inquiry is carried out through Geographic Information Systems analysis and interviews with forest management experts. Results indicate that factors related to forest property rights such as cutting practices, pressure on the land base, land use changes, and proximity to processing facilities can affect <b>forest</b> health and <b>biodiversity.</b> Differences in <b>forest</b> health and <b>biodiversity</b> manifest when analysis is carried out on a small spatial scale (e. g. a single forest management district) yet tend to “even out” when analysing at a larger spatial scale (e. g. multiple forest management districts) ...|$|R
