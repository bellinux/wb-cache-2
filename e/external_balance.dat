Japan became the sixth-most powerful naval force by combined tonnage, while the Russian Navy declined to one barely stronger than that of Austria–Hungary. The actual costs of the war were large enough to affect the Russian economy and, despite grain exports, the nation developed an <b>external</b> <b>balance</b> of payments deficit. The cost of military re-equipment and re-expansion after 1905 pushed the economy further into deficit, although the size of the deficit was obscured.|$|E

In 1969 Wilson sent British troops to Northern Ireland. After losing the 1970 general election to Edward Heath, he spent four years as Leader of the Opposition before the February 1974 general election resulted in a hung parliament. After Heath's talks with the Liberals broke down, Wilson returned to power as leader of a minority government until {{there was a second}} general election in the autumn, which resulted in a narrow Labour victory. A period of economic crisis was now beginning to hit most Western countries, and in 1976 Wilson suddenly announced his resignation as Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|The main {{elements}} of the economic strategy proposed by the García government were full of promise. They recognized the prior neglect of the agricultural sector and called for redirecting public programs toward promotion of agricultural growth and reduction of rural poverty. Correspondingly, economic activity was to be decentralized to break down its high concentration in Lima, and within the cities resources were to be redirected away from the capital-intensive and import-intensive modern sector to the labor-intensive informal sector. A strategy of concertación (national understanding) with private business leaders on economic issues was to be used systematically to avoid disruptive conflict. Problems of <b>external</b> <b>balance</b> were to be answered both by restructuring production to lessen dependence on imports and by reorienting toward higher exports over the long-term.|$|E

The main characteristic of all these structures is that they subdivide space (in an hierarchical and regular fashion) into disjoint regions. These spatial access methods are fully dynamic, while insertions are not complicated to program and affect only one path in the tree. Moreover, x-BR trees are variable resolution structures. That is, the number of space subdivisions is not predefined, making these structures suitable for very large amounts of data. Due to the balanced nature of these structures and the disjointness of the resulting regions, searches and other queries in these trees are processed very efficient [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between oil price fluctuations and <b>external</b> <b>balances</b> of Turkey {{is the main}} concern of this paper. Economic growth performance of Turkey depends on imported capital goods as well as oil. Oil price increases bring a heavy burden for Turkish economy since Turkey is an oil-importing developing economy. Therefore, {{it is important to}} analyze the effects of oil price increases on <b>external</b> <b>balances</b> as well as on economic growth rate. We aim {{to examine the effects of}} imported oil price fluctuations on Turkey’s trade and current account balances using structural vector autoregression (VAR) model in this paper. Monthly data set for the period of 2000 - 2012 is used in this study. In order to capture the net effects of imported oil price on Turkey’s <b>external</b> <b>balances,</b> output gap is used as a control variable in the model. Early results through impulse response functions (IRFs) and variance decomposition indicated that the net effect of oil price fluctuations on <b>external</b> <b>balances</b> exist in the short run.

25|$|Whatever the {{promises}} {{and the costs}} of the many kinds of reform attempted by the Velasco government, the ship sank because of inadequate attention to balances between spending and productive capacity, and between export incentives and import demand. The Velasco government inherited recessionary conditions in 1968, with a positive <b>external</b> <b>balance</b> and productive capacity readily available for expansion. It maintained effective restraint on spending and deficits for several years but then let things get out of control. The central government's deficit was no more than 1 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1970, but its own deficit plus that of the greatly expanded group of state firms reached 10 percent of GNP by 1975. Correspondingly, the external current-account balance was positive in the period 1968-70 but showed a deficit equal to 10 percent of GNP by 1975.|$|E

In August 2008 the IMF warned that the country's outlook had worsened due to a twin shock: financial turmoil and rising commodity prices. Both developments harmed the UK more than most developed countries, as it obtained revenue from exporting financial services while running deficits in goods and commodities, including food. In 2007, the UK had the world's third largest current account deficit, due mainly to a large deficit in manufactured goods.

The resulting equations embody both closed, partially open and completely open economies as special cases, and are arguably more properly specified than those previously used in the literature. We apply these semi-structural equations to a large panel data set. While our findings by and large are in agreement with most of previous studies, our semi-structural equations give much more plausible estimation results for saving and investment than conventional specification. ...|$|R
40|$|Awokuse, Titus O. This thesis {{investigates the}} nature of the dynamic {{relationship}} between <b>external</b> <b>balances</b> and exchange rate dynamics in a macroeconomy. Specifically, this study focuses on how various measures of <b>external</b> <b>balances</b> serve as economic buffers to mitigate the effect of exchange rate shock to the economy. It examines the dynamic relationship between <b>external</b> <b>balances</b> and exchange rate shock via the application of cointegrated vector autoregression method and innovation accounting with generalized impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions. The data sample spans the period 1986 - 2008 and includes three important developing countries: Brazil, China and India. Empirical evidence shows that for China and India, understanding of the exchange rate dynamics is helpful in predicting the movement of <b>external</b> <b>balances.</b> But for Brazil, the reverse path is true. Results of generalized impulse responses suggest that <b>external</b> <b>balances</b> demonstrate a predictable and systematic pattern after a one-time exchange rate shock. Specifically, the results indicate that exchange rate shock generates a positive response in current account adjustment and has a negative impact on capital gains. The latter soon gives rise to a small drop in current account balance due to temporary income shock and capital mobility. Taking account of the overall current account and capital gains adjustment (one positive and one negative), change in net foreign assets (NFA) position is largely cushioned from exchange rate shock. Integrating the results of generalized impulse responses and Granger causality tests, it is easy to find that there exists a feedback mechanism which significantly contributes to the adjustment of external imbalances. Moreover, terms of trade and domestic productivity serve as transmission channels which {{play a critical role in}} the system. From a policy perspective, in coping with enlarged global imbalances, exchange rate as well as terms of trade and domestic productivity should receive more attention in policy decisions to stabilize the economy.

5000|$|States {{are deemed}} similar {{in terms of}} needs but not in {{capabilities}} for achieving them. The positional placement of states in terms of abilities determines the distribution of capabilities. The structural distribution of capabilities then limits cooperation among states through fears of relative gains made by other states, {{and the possibility of}} dependence on other states. The desire and relative abilities of each state to maximize relative power constrain each other, resulting in a 'balance of power', which shapes international relations. It also gives rise to the 'security dilemma' that all nations face. There are two ways in which states balance power: internal <b>balancing</b> and <b>external</b> <b>balancing.</b> Internal balancing occurs as states grow their own capabilities by increasing economic growth and/or increasing military spending. <b>External</b> <b>balancing</b> occurs as states enter into alliances to check the power of more powerful states or alliances.citation needed ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1941 flutter was a {{familiar}} engineering problem related to a too-flexible tail, but the P-38's empennage was completely skinned in aluminum rather than fabric and was quite rigid. At no time did the P-38 suffer from true flutter. To prove a point, one elevator and its vertical stabilizers were skinned with metal 63% thicker than standard, but the increase in rigidity made no difference in vibration. Army Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth B. Wolfe (head of Army Production Engineering) asked Lockheed to try <b>external</b> mass <b>balances</b> {{above and below the}} elevator, though the P-38 already had large mass balances elegantly placed within each vertical stabilizer.

That’s why, an analysis in which is needed to discover the sources that cause the trade deficit, is not only opportune, but also imperative, because the existence of the trade deficit determines the amassment of external debt, which subdues Romania to numerous efforts in order to pay back the debt and the interest. The present paper analysis the evolution of the Romanian <b>external</b> trade <b>balance</b> with its elements, from 1990 till the end of 2009, in order to find out its essential characteristics and what are the sources for the trade deficit of this country, by emphasizing on the continuity and discontinuity factors from the evolution of the <b>external</b> trade <b>balance,</b> and also the resources for financing the deficit.

The composite evidence points to the positive effects of appreciation through cheaper imports in support of higher growth and lower price inflation in advanced and developing countries. However, the negative effects of appreciation are more pervasive on the <b>external</b> <b>balances</b> in developing countries. The implication is developing countries remain highly dependent on exports of commodities. In contrast, advanced countries are more diversified and ahead in capitalizing on currency appreciation to mobilize investment growth, a channel that boosts competitiveness and mitigates the adverse effect of appreciation on external stability.

First, we show that the effect of oil demand and supply shocks on the merchandise trade balance and the current account, which depending on the source of the shock can be large, depends critically on the response of the non-oil trade balance. Our results provide evidence of an intermediate degree of international financial integration. Second, we document the presence of large and systematic valuation effects in response to these shocks.
