These are the Adjusted Present Value, Adjusted Discount Rate and Flows to <b>Equity</b> <b>methods.</b> To achieve identical valuations, however, the different methods must be implemented with cost of capital expressions that embody a consistent set of assumptions about (1) the tax regime and (2) the time pattern and riskiness of debt tax shields. Valuation and cost of capital expressions that have been proposed in the literature are grouped and contrasted according to these assumptions. It is also shown that the familiar weighted average cost of capital can be consistent with any such set of assumptions, {{as long as the}} correct expression is used to estimate the relationship between the levered and unlevered cost of equity. ...|$|R
40|$|Background At the Rio Summit in 2011 on Social Determinants of Health, {{the global}} {{community}} recognized a pressing need to take action on reducing health inequities. This requires an improved evidence base {{on the effects of}} national and international policies on health inequities. Although systematic reviews are recognized as an important source for evidence-informed policy, they have been criticized for failing to assess effects on health <b>equity.</b> <b>Methods</b> This article summarizes guidance on both conducting systematic reviews with a focus on health <b>equity</b> and on <b>methods</b> to translate their findings to different audiences. This guidance was developed based on a series of methodology meetings, previous guidance, a recently developed reporting guideline for equity-focused systematic reviews (PRISMA-Equity 2012) and a systematic review of methods to assess health equity in systematic reviews. Results We make ten recommendations for conducting equity-focused systematic reviews; and five considerations for knowledge translation. Illustrative examples of equity-focused reviews are provided where these methods have been used.

40|$|Abstract Background Few {{research}} projects have analyzed how social determinants of health impact cities in North Africa. The sustained growth {{in these countries}} has nevertheless proven to exacerbate health disparities and create many social and economic inequalities. This strategic analysis examines selected social determinants of health in a major urban centre of Tunisia, identifies the most influential stakeholders able to influence equity/inequity, and reviews the accomplishments and need for action to foster health <b>equity.</b> <b>Methods</b> This analysis was performed through a literature review and participatory research methods that included focus groups discussions and interview with key informants. Results Access to health care, changes in lifestyles, housing issues and gender-related inequities are prime, socially-determined elements that affect health in Ariana. Conclusion Recognition of emerging health issues is needed along with improved inter and intrasectoral coordination among stakeholders.

40|$|Objectives To {{understand}} how knowledge {{is used to}} inform policy on Health Equity Funds (HEFs) in Cambodia; and to draw lessons for translating knowledge into health policies that promote <b>equity.</b> <b>Methods</b> We used a knowledge translation framework to analyse the HEF policy process between 2000 and 2008. The analysis was {{based on data from}} document analysis, key informant interviews and authors' observations. Results The HEF policy-making process in Cambodia was both innovative and incremental. Insights from pilot projects were gradually translated into national health policy. The uptake of HEF in health policy was determined by three important factors: a policy context conducive to the creation, dissemination and adoption of lessons gained in HEF pilots; the credibility and timeliness of HEF knowledge generated from pilot projects; and strong commitment, relationships and networks among actors. Conclusions Knowledge locally generated through pilot projects is crucial for innovative health policy. It can help adapt blueprints and best practices to a local context and creates ownership. While international organisations and donors can take a leading role in innovative interventions in low-income countries, the involvement of government policy makers is necessary for their scaling-up.

40|$|Background: Pay-for-performance is an {{increasingly}} popular approach to improving health care quality, and the US government will soon implement pay-for-performance in hospitals nationwide. Yet hospital capacity to perform (and improve performance) likely depends on local resources. In this study, we quantify {{the association between}} hospital performance and local economic and human resources, and describe possible implications of pay-for-performance for socioeconomic <b>equity.</b> <b>Methods</b> and Findings: We applied county-level measures of local economic and workforce resources to a national sample of US hospitals (n = 2, 705), during the period 2004 – 2007. We analyzed performance for two common cardiac conditions (acute myocardial infarction [AMI] and heart failure [HF]), using process-of-care measures from the Hospital Quality Alliance [HQA], and isolated temporal trends and the contributions of individual resource dimensions on performance, using multivariable mixed models. Performance scores were translated into net scores for hospitals using the Performance Assessment Model, which has been suggested {{as a basis for}} reimbursement under Medicare’s ‘‘Value-Based Purchasing’’ program. Our analyses showed that hospital performance is substantially associated with local economic and workforce resources. For example, for HF in 2004, hospitals located in counties with longstanding poverty had mean HQA composite scores of 73. 0, compared with a mean of 84. 1 for hospitals in counties without longstanding poverty (p, 0. 001).

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{decision}} {{usefulness of the}} <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> of accounting from two perspectives. First, I examine the value relevance of information provided under the <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> relative to the value relevance of information resulting from measuring investments in affiliates at fair value. For a sample of 221 U. S. investors with publicly-traded affiliates during 1993 - 2011, I find that balance sheet measures of investments in publicly-traded affiliates provided under the <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> are associated with investors' stock prices, but income from these affiliates recognized under the <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> is not associated with investors' stock prices. In addition, fair value balance sheet and income measures of investments in publicly-traded affiliates are incrementally associated with investors' stock prices after controlling for information provided under the <b>equity</b> <b>method.</b> The incremental value relevance of fair value measures for investments in publicly-traded affiliates exists for both investments identified as held for sale and those identified as strategic, with {{no evidence that the}} incremental value relevance is higher (lower) for investments identified as held for sale (strategic). This result suggests that the 2010 and 2013 proposals by the U. S. Financial Accounting Standards Board to distinguish between investments in affiliates based on management's intended method of value realization are not supported by differences in the relative value relevance of fair value measures for these types of investments. Second, I evaluate whether <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> investors use their significant influence to manage income reported under the <b>equity</b> <b>method.</b> For a sample of 202 U. S. firms from 1993 - 2011, I find that signed discretionary accruals of affiliates are higher when income from affiliates allows investors to meet earnings targets. This result is consistent with <b>equity</b> <b>method</b> investors influencing the financial reporting of affiliates to achieve earnings targets. Dissertatio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Targeting {{of health}} {{interventions}} to poor children {{at highest risk}} of mortality are promising approaches for enhancing <b>equity.</b> <b>Methods</b> have emerged to accurately quantify excess risk and identify space-time disparities. This provides useful and detailed information for guiding policy. A spatio-temporal analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with child (1 - 4 years) mortality in the Agincourt sub-district, South Africa, to assess temporal changes in child mortality patterns within the study site between 1992 and 2007, and to produce all-cause and cause-specific mortality maps to identify high risk areas. Demographic, maternal, paternal and fertility-related factors, household mortality experience, distance to health care facility and socio-economic status were among the examined risk factors. The analysis {{was carried out by}} fitting a Bayesian discrete time Bernoulli survival geostatistical model using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Bayesian kriging was used to produce mortality risk maps. Significant temporal increase in child mortality was observed due to the HIV epidemic. A distinct spatial risk pattern was observed with higher risk areas being concentrated in poorer settlements on {{the eastern part of the}} study area, largely inhabited by former Mozambican refugees. The major risk factors for childhood mortality, following multivariate adjustment, were mother’s death (especially when due to HIV and tuberculosis), greater number of children under 5 years living in the same household and winter season.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{equity in}} the geographical distribution of community pharmacies in South Africa and assess whether regulatory reforms have furthered such <b>equity.</b> <b>Methods</b> Data on community pharmacies from the national {{department of health and}} the South African pharmacy council were used to analyse the change in community pharmacy ownership and density (number per 10 000 residents) between 1994 and 2012 in all nine provinces and 15 selected districts. In addition, the density of public clinics, alone and with community pharmacies, was calculated and compared with a national benchmark of one clinic per 10 000 residents. Interviews were conducted with nine national experts from the pharmacy sector. Findings Community pharmacies increased in number by 13 % between 1994 and 2012 – less than the 25 % population growth. In 2012, community pharmacy density was higher in urban provinces and was eight times higher in the least deprived districts than in the most deprived ones. Maldistribution persisted despite the growth of corporate community pharmacies. In 2012, only two provinces met the 1 per 10 000 benchmark, although all provinces achieved it when community pharmacies and clinics were combined. Experts expressed concerns that a lack of rural incentives, inappropriate licensing criteria and a shortage of pharmacy workers could undermine access to pharmaceutical services, especially in rural areas.
