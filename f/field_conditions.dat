5|$|Because {{of these}} and other successes, Lowe was {{authorized}} to build four additional balloons and the needed inflation equipment. However, Lowe's initial successes proved difficult to recreate in <b>field</b> <b>conditions,</b> and aside from limited successes, such as at the Battle of Seven Pines, the utility of the Balloon Corps was limited. In addition, jurisdictional squabbles arose between Lowe's civilian command and the military officers under whom he worked. By early 1863, Lowe had grown tired of dealing with military minutia and left the Corps, returning to civilian research. The Balloon Corps fell to the command of less-capable individuals and was eventually eliminated in August 1863.|$|E

The volume of intercellular air space did not change significantly between the densely-grown plants and sparely-grown ones, but the volume of interfoliar air space of the former was smaller {{than that of the}} latter. 3. The volume of interfoliar air space in the plants cultured under heavy manured with nitrogen was larger than that in control plants. Reversely, the volume of intercellular air space was small in heavy fertilized plants. 4.

40|$|A {{sequential}} {{extraction procedure}} {{was applied to}} acid sulfate soil materials from a soil profile to investigate the effect of sample pretreatment on the geochemical fractionation of selected metals. The samples were prepared for analysis by oven-drying, sieving and grinding the soil, or were examined as collected in <b>field</b> <b>condition.</b> The soil profile encompassed oxidising conditions near the surface, through to reducing conditions at depth. Six metals (Fe, Cr, Ni, Mn, Cu, and Zn) were measured during the sequential extraction procedure, and their fractionation determined in the oxidised and in the reduced zone. Although cumulative totals (the sum of all steps in the sequential extraction procedure) for the metals extracted from both the <b>field</b> <b>condition</b> and dried/ground samples were similar, some significant differences in fractionation within individual extraction steps were observed. Of particular interest was the redistribution of metals from the sulfide-bearing (pyrite-bound) fraction to the more readily available fractions (i. e. labile and acid-soluble), {{as a result of}} oven-drying and grinding.
