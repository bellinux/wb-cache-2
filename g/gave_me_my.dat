[...] The singer also commented regarding the filming shoot, [...] "The entire day was such a love fest, casting actual fans {{to participate in this}} shoot really brought the concept to life.

He was invited to audition by Kenneth Branagh, the film's director, after having previously worked with Branagh on Ivanov and Wallander. Hiddleston said of Branagh, [...] "Ken has had a life-changing effect. He was able to say to the executives, 'Trust me on this, you can cast Tom and he will deliver'. It was massive and it's completely changed the course of what is available to me to do. Ken <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> break." [...] In the beginning, he originally auditioned for the part of Thor. [...] "I initially auditioned to play Thor. That was what I was being considered for, because I'm tall and blonde and classically trained, and that seemed to be the mold for what Thor was, he was to be a classical character. And it was in my auditions. I owe this entirely to Marvel and their open-mindedness, they saw something that they thought was interesting. They saw some temperament that they liked." [...] The casting director gave Hiddleston six weeks to bulk up, so he went on a strict diet and gained twenty pounds of muscle. In the end, Branagh decided he was more suitable as the antagonist and cast him as Loki.|$|E
500|$|The album artwork for Irresistible {{was shot}} by Alberto Tolot in April 2001. The front sleeve cover shows Simpson, wearing heavy makeup and with blond hair, dressed in a semi-transparent shirt, raising it a bit to expose her navel. Simpson said [...] "God <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> body, you know. I'm just doing what I can {{to make it look}} good." [...] Later in an {{interview}} with the Orlando Sentinel, she said that the album art was [...] "a sign of confidence". However, the cover received negative attention from many critics, including the conservative Christian publication Plugged In, which was a strong supporter of Simpson and her virgin image, and Sweet Kisses. They stated, [...] "If anything, Irresistible copes with temptation by yielding to it which, in conjunction with Simpson's general immodesty, models a dubious sexual ethic." [...] Canadian music magazine Chart also gave a negative response, writing [...] "it takes more than wearing see-through clothes, with airbrushed, non-existent nipples, to show that you have matured." [...] A few critics criticized the art for being digitally edited, while others commented on Simpson's similarity to Spears. The Japanese version of the album has the same front sleeve artwork as that of [...] "Irresistible" [...] single.|$|E
500|$|An Argyle Hall of Famer {{returned}} to Home Park on 18 October 2009, when former England international Paul Mariner was appointed as the club's new head coach. [...] "In football, {{there is not}} much sentiment. But, if sentiment is involved in this scenario, then they <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> very first chance as a player so I grabbed it with both hands," [...] said Mariner on the New England Revolution website, the club he left to rejoin Argyle. [...] "Plymouth Argyle are in my blood. Obviously the teams you're associated with are the ones you look for every week, and when they came knocking on my door asking me to be employed there, I was delighted." [...] His first match in the dugout alongside Sturrock ended in disappointment as Argyle lost 3–1 to Bristol City at Ashton Gate. They faced Ipswich Town, another side struggling for form, at home in their next match and a first-half goal from Fletcher put Argyle ahead, but their hopes of claiming three points were dented when the visitors equalised through striker Jon Stead, who capitalised on a poor back pass from Gary Sawyer. Welshman Darcy Blake, on loan from Cardiff City, was shown a straight red card late in the game as it ended all square. Their final game of October took place on Halloween against Middlesbrough, in Gordon Strachan's first game as their new manager. Argyle came away from the Riverside Stadium with all three points, in a game that saw Adam Johnson miss from the penalty spot, thanks to a second-half goal from Mackie to lift them to 22nd in the league table, within three points of Doncaster Rovers.|$|E

A 2–0 win for the visitors confirmed Argyle's relegation to League One and Newcastle's promotion back to the Premier League as champions at the first attempt. Hours after the match, the club's board declared that it remained determined to steer {{it to the top}} flight of English football. Paul Mariner reaffirmed his commitment to the club, vowing to put things right. [...] "I feel the pain of the supporters because this is the club that <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> first start," [...] he said. [...] "The reason I came here was because of the vision that the club can get into the Premiership. Now we've got another couple of hurdles before we do that but I firmly believe that we can do it." [...] Argyle's penultimate game of the season took place at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest, who had already qualified for the play-off's, and they secured a comfortable 3–0 victory against the relegated side. The club signed off their campaign with another home defeat against Peterborough United on 2 May. Argyle took the lead in the first-half from a fine individual goal from Wright-Phillips but conceded two goals after the break to Craig Mackail-Smith. Four days later, the club announced that they would be searching for a new manager, with Paul Mariner reverting to his original role as head coach. He said: [...] "I am disappointed that we could not produce the results we wanted last season. I am a realist and understand why and how the board came to the conclusion they have done. I am committed to this club and want only to help it regain Championship status as soon as possible and build on that." [...] Work on a new state-of-the-art Fibrelastic pitch at Home Park began the following week.|$|E

In the 1990s, Evans hosted infomercials for Rejuvenique, a mask for toning facial muscles. She had previously written the Linda Evans Beauty and Exercise book in 1983.

2500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2004–05 season, Cahill was {{transferred}} to Everton for a fee of £1.5million, after Millwall's South East London rivals Crystal Palace ended negotiations of a potential transfer to themselves over a payment to his agents. In his first season, he was Everton's top goalscorer and was the fans' Player of the Season. Before the 2005–06 season Cahill's contract at Everton was extended with a salary increase reflecting the impact he had made at the club. The third round of that season's FA Cup drew Cahill's former club, Millwall against Everton at The Den. He scored the winner in the replay at Goodison Park, but chose not to celebrate his winning goal, stating, [...] "I decided not to go mad and just pay my respects to the club that <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> start in the game.
