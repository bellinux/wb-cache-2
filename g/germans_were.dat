5|$|As the 108th Infantry Regiment was {{responsible}} for the right sector of the divisional defence, this meant that the 42nd Infantry Regiment, which was originally responsible only for the left sector, had to extend across the entire divisional frontage. During the night, the commander of the divisional cavalry battalion sent patrols towards the German bridgehead, but local Ustaše sympathisers misled them into believing the <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> already across the Drava at Barcs in strength. The <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> subsequently able to consolidate their bridgehead at Barcs overnight.|$|E
5|$|Gens {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with the Judenrat and Friend over the Jewish policemen who guarded the gates into the ghetto. The Germans allowed the Jewish policemen to control access to the ghetto and conduct searches for contraband. Gens' policy was that when no <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> present at the gates, the policemen would do minimal searches and would allow smuggling of food and other necessary items. If <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> present at the gates, the policemen conducted thorough searches and often beat up attempted smugglers. In Gens' view, if the Germans thought the Jewish policemen were not vigilant enough, the policemen would be replaced by German guards and any opportunity for smuggling would cease. He also claimed that even when the <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> present, any confiscated items were brought into the ghetto, which {{would not be the}} case if there were German guards at the gates.|$|E

50|$|In Southern Jutland {{in southwestern}} Denmark, <b>German</b> <b>is</b> also spoken by the North Schleswig <b>Germans,</b> and <b>German</b> <b>is</b> a {{recognized}} minority language in this region. <b>German</b> <b>is</b> the primary language among the Danish minority of Southern Schleswig, and likewise, Danish {{is the primary}} language of the North Schleswig Germans.

5|$|West <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> able {{to cross}} the border {{relatively}} freely to visit relatives, but had to go through numerous bureaucratic formalities. East <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> subjected to far stricter restrictions. It was not until November 1964 that they were allowed to visit the West at all, and even then only pensioners were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did people look forward to old age. Younger East <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> not allowed to travel to the West until 1972, though few did so until the mid-1980s. They had to apply for an exit visa and passport, pay a substantial fee, obtain permission from their employer and undergo an interrogation from the police.|$|E
5|$|Conditions were {{worst in}} the Allied {{trenches}}. The <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> more {{willing to accept the}} trenches as long-term positions, and used concrete blocks to build secure shelters deep underground, often with electrical lighting and heating.|$|E
5|$|Hindered by total Allied {{air superiority}} and a {{large-scale}} uprising by the French Resistance, the weak German forces were swiftly defeated. The Germans decided to withdraw towards the north through the Rhône valley, {{to establish a}} stable defense line at Dijon. Allied mobile units were able to overtake the Germans and partially block their route at the town of Montélimar. The ensuing battle led to a stalemate, with neither side able to achieve a decisive breakthrough, until the <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> finally able to complete their withdrawal and retreat from the town. While the <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> retreating, the French managed to capture the important ports of Marseille and Toulon, putting them into operation soon after.|$|E

5|$|In 1943 French agents {{reported}} that the <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> planning to mount an offensive against the United Kingdom that would involve the use of secret weapons resembling giant mortars sunk {{in the ground and}} served by rail links. The first signs of abnormal activity at Mimoyecques were spotted by analysts at the Allied Central Interpretation Unit in September 1943, when aerial reconnaissance revealed that the <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> building railway loops leading to the tunnels into the eastern and western sites. Further reconnaissance flights in October 1943 photographed large-scale activity around the tunnels.|$|E

5|$|The {{complaints}} from the SS-FHA {{about the quality}} of Volksdeutsche recruits had no effect on Berger's approach. He concluded further agreements with Hungary and Romania, and imposed on the puppet regimes of the Independent State of Croatia and the Slovak State, to effectively authorise the unrestricted conscription of ethnic Germans in those territories. In the German-occupied territory of Serbia, the General Government (annexed Poland) and parts of the Soviet Union, ethnic <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> conscripted into the Waffen-SS in the same arbitrary manner Reich <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> conscripted by the Wehrmacht.

5|$|The {{situation}} of the Banat-Swabians, the German-speaking minority in Romania, is a recurring theme in Müller's writing. Historically, <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> recruited by the Austria-Hungary to repopulate southern areas following the expulsion of the Turks of the Ottoman Empire. They were given special privileges, allowed to keep their language and Roman Catholicism, even in areas in which the Orthodox Church was paramount. Their communities spoke German into the 20th century. They were among ethnic Germans, or Volksdeutsche, whom Adolph Hitler proposed to unite in a greater Germany. Millions of ethnic <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> expelled from eastern Europe after the war; thousands were forced into labor camps. Even years later, they were often discriminated against in Romania under the communist government.|$|E
5|$|Thousands of people, {{primarily}} diplomats, of nationalities {{associated with}} the Allies (China and Mexico, for example) and Spanish Civil War refugees in occupied France were interned or executed.
