By 1979 the FCC demanded that home computer makers submit samples for radio frequency <b>interference</b> <b>testing.</b> It was found that [...] "first generation" [...] home computers emitted too much radio frequency noise for household use. The Atari 400 and 800 were designed with heavy RF shielding to meet the new requirements. Between 1980 and 1982 regulations governing RF emittance from home computers were phased in. Some companies appealed to the FCC to waive the requirements for home computers, while others (with compliant designs) objected to the waiver.

The pulse <b>interference</b> <b>test</b> is highly sensitive to hydrogeological properties between the pulse source and receiver wells.

The advantages of the pulse <b>interference</b> <b>test</b> are the short duration of the test, the high resolution and directional characterization data obtained, {{and the lack of}} any generated contaminated groundwater. To maximize the pulse test’s resolution, a small section of the injector well is isolated by packers, the flow rate into the source injector well is rate controlled and set at a constant flow rate depending on the site hydraulic conditions. High precision pressure transducers are located in receiver wells and isolated from receiver borehole storage effects by straddle packers. Thus the pulse is basically a point source, and borehole storage effects are eliminated from both the injector and receiver wells. The injector well is pulsed for a set time, shut in for the same time period, and the cycle repeated. The pulse source and receivers can be located at differing depth locations in their respective wells and a detailed image of the site’s hydraulic conditions can be determined.

The various types of language transfer are also stated in the first chapter and a thorough analysis in relation to how and when language transfer occurs is provided. The second chapter involves a definition of contextual grammar and its role and function regarding negative transfer as well as a detailed account of the use of verb tenses in both English and Greek and consequently states and classifies the differences in verb tense use between the two languages that could originate negative transfer in L 2 performance.

40|$|Background: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} the effect of the location of the rotational center and the morphology of teeth resulting in interference with the rotational path of insertion and to estimate when an <b>interference</b> <b>test</b> should be performed. Methods: A total of 400 dental radiograms of maxillary and mandibular first and second molars (100 for each position) were selected. The radiograms were used to hand-sketch the outlines on tracing paper. Then, an <b>interference</b> <b>test</b> was simulated using calipers. Mesial long occlusal rest seats with three different lengths were designed. A curve-simulated rotational path was drawn on the tracing paper showing the outline of a molar. If the curve was intersected by the mesial outline, interference was occurred. A total of 1200 tests were performed. Results: A significant number of interference cases (18. 5 %, N =  400) occurred when the rotational center was placed at the most distal margin of the occlusal surface. The interference was reduced (2. 75 %, N =  400) but still present at the distal fourth of the occlusal surface. At the distal one-third of the occlusal surface, interference did not occur (0 %, N =  400). There was {{a significant difference between the}} results of the three rotational centers (p <  0. 0001).
