40|$|Crude oil, {{coal and}} gas, known as <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> {{play a crucial}} role in the global economy. This paper proposes new {{econometrics}} modelling to demonstrate the trend of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> consumption. The main variables affecting consumption trends are: world reserves, the price of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> US production and US net imports. All variables have been analysed individually for more than half a century. The research found that while the consumption of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> worldwide has increased trends in the US production and net imports have been dependent on the type of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b> Most of the US coal and gas production has been for domestic use, which is why it does not have a strong influence on worldwide <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> prices. Moreover, the reserves of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> have not shown any diminution during the last couple of decades and predictions that they were about to run out are not substantiated.

However, our legal and economic systems fail to recognise {{the value of the}} ecosystem service subsidies embedded in <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b> This ecosystem services price subsidy causes overuse and waste of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> in the free market: <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> are consumed more quickly than they can be replaced by ecosystem services and in far larger quantities than they would be if the price of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> included the cost of solar energy collection, concentration and manufacturing of raw <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b> Moreover, burning <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> produces enormous environmental, human health and welfare costs and damage.

40|$|During {{the past}} century, fossil fuels—petroleum liquids, {{natural gas and}} coal—were the {{dominant}} source of world energy production. From 1950 to 2005, <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> provided 85 – 93 % of all energy production. All <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> grew substantially during this period, their combined growth exceeding the increase in world population. This growth, however, was irregular, providing for rapidly growing per capita production from 1950 to 1980, stable per capita production from 1980 to 2000 and rising per capita production again after 2000. During the past half century, growth in <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> production was essentially limited by energy demand.

40|$|The Green Paradox states that, in {{the absence}} of an {{appropriate}} tax on CO 2 emissions, subsidizing a renewable backstop such as solar or wind energy brings forward the date at which <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> become exhausted and consequently global warming is aggravated. We shed light on this issue by solving a model of depletion of non-renewable <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> followed by a switch to a clean renewable backstop, paying attention to timing of the switch and the amount of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> remaining unexploited. We show that the Green Paradox occurs if the backstop is relatively expensive and full exhaustion of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> is optimal, but does not occur if the backstop is sufficiently cheap relative to the cost of extracting the last drop of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> plus marginal global warming damages as then it is attractive to leave <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> unexploited and thus limit CO 2 emissions. We show that, without a carbon tax, subsidizing (taxing) the backstop might enhance social welfare if <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> reserves are not fully (fully) exhausted.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Historically, <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> {{have been}} vital for our global energy needs. However {{climate change is}} {{prompting}} renewed interest {{in the role of}} <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> production for our energy needs. In order to appropriately plan for our future energy needs, a new detailed model of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> supply is required. It is critical to know if <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> will still be able to supply most of our energy requirements and meet the ever increasing energy demand in the future. Answering these questions is critical in order to identify potential periods of energy shortages; so that alternative energy resources can be utilised in a timely way. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a model to predict <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> production for the long term based on historical production data, projected demand, and assumed ultimately recoverable reserves for coal, gas and oil. Climate change is an important issue confronting society, and it is hoped that the work contained in this thesis will aid climate change modeling by focusing attention to realistic <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> production projections. <b>Fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> are currently an essential component in the global economy and the growth of the human population.
