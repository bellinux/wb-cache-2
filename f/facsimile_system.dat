Stroke speed is usually expressed as a number of strokes per minute. When the fax system scans in both directions, the stroke speed is twice this number. In most conventional 20th century mechanical systems, the stroke speed is equivalent to drum speed.|$|R

She also developed a radar <b>facsimile</b> <b>system</b> and patented a sonic device for preventing ice buildup on planes.|$|E
5000|$|The first [...] "pantelegram" [...] {{was sent}} from Lyons to Paris on 10 February 1862. The Corps législatif later ordered the {{installation}} of the pantelegraph on the railway line between the two cities, and from February 1863 the public was able to use it. French law was enacted in 1864 for the pantelegraph <b>facsimile</b> <b>system</b> to be officially accepted. The next year in 1865 the operations started with the Paris to Lyons line and extended to Marseille in 1867.|$|E

40|$|Compound {{document}} images contain graphic or textual content {{along with}} pictures. They {{are a very}} common form of documents, found in magazines, brochures, web-sites, etc. We focus our attention on the mixed raster content (MRC) multi-layer approach for compound image compression. We study block thresholding {{as a mean to}} segment an image for MRC. An attempt is made to optimize the block threshold in a rate-distortion sense. Rate-distortion curves are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. 1. INTRODUCTION Document compression is frequently linked to <b>facsimile</b> <b>systems,</b> in which large document bitmaps are compressed before transmission over telephone lines. There is now a focus on new standards to provide color facsimile services over the telephone network and the Internet [1].

5000|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1930s, the Finch <b>Facsimile</b> <b>system</b> was used to {{transmit}} a [...] "radio newspaper" [...] to private homes via commercial AM radio stations and ordinary radio receivers equipped with Finch's printer, which used thermal paper. Sensing a new and potentially golden opportunity, competitors soon entered the field, but the printer and special paper were expensive luxuries, AM radio transmission was very slow and vulnerable to static, and the newspaper was too small. After {{more than ten years}} of repeated attempts by Finch and others to establish such a service as a viable business, the public, apparently quite content with its cheaper and much more substantial home-delivered daily newspapers, and with conventional spoken radio bulletins to provide any [...] "hot" [...] news, still showed only a passing curiosity about the new medium.|$|E
50|$|The {{scientific}} instruments consisted of an ion chamber and Geiger-Müller tube to measure total radiation flux, a proportional radiation counter telescope to measure high energy radiation, a scintillation counter to monitor low-energy radiation, a VLF receiver for natural radio waves, a transponder to study electron density, {{and part of}} the flux-gate and search coil magnetometers mounted on the instrument platform. The micrometeorite detector and sun scanner were mounted on the sphere. The difference between the payload of Pioneer P-30 and the earlier Pioneer P-3 was the replacement of the TV <b>facsimile</b> <b>system</b> on P-3 with a scintillation spectrometer to study the Earth's (and possible lunar) radiation belts, mounted on the instrument platform, and a plasma probe mounted on the sphere to measure energy and momentum distribution of protons above a few kilovolts to study the radiation effect of solar flares. The total mass of the science package including electronics and power supply was roughly 60 kg. Total cost of the mission was estimated at 9-10 million dollars.|$|E
5000|$|The station traces {{its origin}} to an {{experimental}} [...] "Apex band" [...] radio station, W2XWF on 42.18 MHz, which was authorized in 1940 and licensed to radio engineer William G. H. Finch. In 1941 {{the station was}} authorized to convert to a commercial FM station, W55NY transmitting on 45.5 MHz. In 1943 the call letters were changed to WFGG, which were changed to WGHF in 1945. One of the uses of the station was to test Finch's broadcast <b>facsimile</b> <b>system.</b> By 1946, the station was broadcasting on 99.7 MHz, moving to 101.9 in 1947. In late 1948, it became the New York City affiliate of the farm-oriented Rural Radio Network based in Ithaca, New York, which owned a group of upstate stations that would later associate with WQXR. In 1955, its then-owner, Muzak, changed the call letters to WBFM. [...] Reflecting its parent owner, the station aired a mostly-instrumental beautiful music radio format.|$|E

Thus, in the time domain, a few random pulses occur while scanning.|$|R

40|$|Utility of the Marshall Space Flight (MSFC) <b>facsimile</b> camera <b>system</b> for {{extraterrestrial}} geologic exploration {{was investigated}} {{during the spring}} of 1971 near Merriam Crater in northern Arizona.

Its utility would be enhanced by development of computer techniques that utilize digital camera output for construction of topographic maps, and it needs increased resolution for examining near field details. A supplementary imaging system may be necessary for hand specimen examination at low magnification...|$|R
