They with Greek Sacred Band took part in the successful Raid on Symi in July 1944 in which the entire German garrison was either killed or captured. In August 1944, they joined with the Long Range Desert Group in operations in the Adriatic, on the Peloponnese, in Albania, and, finally, Istria. So effective were they that, by 1944, 200–300 SBS men <b>held</b> <b>down</b> six German divisions.|$|E
5|$|Although his new club {{began the}} 2001–02 season strongly, topping the First Division table and looking well placed for regaining the Premier League place that the club had last {{held in the}} 1997–98 season, Bruce {{tendered}} his resignation {{less than three months}} into the season in order to return to Birmingham City as manager. Although he was initially prevented from doing so by an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after a compensation package was agreed. By now he had acquired a reputation as a manager who rarely <b>held</b> <b>down</b> a job for a significant length of time.|$|E
5|$|Born {{near the}} New South Wales country town of Bathurst, Booth moved to Sydney in 1952 and {{played in the}} grade cricket {{competition}} while training to become a teacher. He made his first-class debut for the New South Wales cricket team and came to prominence in dramatic circumstances in his second match, against the touring Englishmen in 195455. Due to late withdrawals, Booth was selected at late notice {{and had to be}} called from work {{on the morning of the}} match. After arriving after the start of the match, he scored 74 following a batting collapse. Booth struggled to make an impression early in his career and missed a season to train and with the Australian field hockey team for the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne. Upon returning to first-class cricket in 195758, he <b>held</b> <b>down</b> a regular position in the state team while the Test players were touring overseas. Booth gradually progressed and gained selection on the 195960 Australian Second XI tour to New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|During the winter, {{they played}} for the Fitzroy Baseball Club, often {{competing}} in matches played as curtain raisers to the elite Australian rules football competition, the Victorian Football League. Saturday night entertainment for the family typically consisted of dinner after the day's cricket for Fitzroy, and Plant, Liddicut and other club personnel were often invited. Under the influence of Plant and Liddicut, the boys were taught to adopt an aggressive approach, using fast feet movement to attack spin bowling in particular. In 1942–43, Neil broke into Fitzroy's First XI, joining his older brothers Merv, Mick, and Ray. During that season, the family <b>held</b> <b>down</b> the first four batting positions for Fitzroy; Merv and Mick opened the batting and Ray and Neil came in after them. The four brothers entered the Victorian team in the 1940s; Merv in 1940–41, Neil in 1946–47, and Ray and Mick in successive seasons thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Some herons, such as {{the black}} heron, adopt an unusual {{position}} while hunting for prey. With their head <b>held</b> <b>down</b> in a hunting position, they sweep their wings forward to meet {{in front of their}} head, thereby forming an umbrella shaped canopy. The primaries and secondaries touch the water, the nape feathers are erected and the tail is drooped, thereby ensuring the canopy is totally enclosed. The bird may take several strides in this position. One theory about the function of this behaviour is that it reduces glare from the water surface, allowing the bird to more easily locate and catch prey. Alternatively, the shade provided by the canopy may attract fish making their capture easier. Some herons adopt a similar behaviour called double-wing feeding in which the wings are swept forward to create an area of shade, though a canopy is not formed.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} that the player controlled would change as they progressed through the game. The creators sought {{to have the}} player control Spock {{during one of the}} Vulcan's mind melds. The ending of the game would have seen the player control Kirk, Spock and Chekov in an attempt to stop the titular superweapon. The interface for the game revolved around a menu which appears after the mouse button is <b>held</b> <b>down</b> while the cursor is hovering over an object. This was to prevent the need for controls to be shown on screen at all times, {{in a manner similar to}} LucasArts games of that period.|$|E

5|$|Dean Lyons {{was born}} on 20 April 1973; he was 24 when he was arrested. He grew up in Tallaght in West Dublin, the fourth {{in a family of}} six children. He went to Scoil Aonghusa National School in Tallaght, where he had some {{difficulty}} with his schoolwork. According to his teachers, in today's terms, he would have been classified as having a moderate general learning disability. He was assessed by a psychologist when he was in sixth class, around the age of twelve, who found him to have an intelligence quotient of 70. As a result of the psychologist's report, Lyons was moved to St. Joseph's Special School in Tallaght. During his period in St. Joseph's, he developed a reputation for attention seeking and storytelling. After school, he never <b>held</b> <b>down</b> a steady job and drifted into heroin addiction and homelessness. At the time of his arrest for the Grangegorman murders, he had one conviction for burglary, and had been involved in a number of syringe robberies.|$|E
5|$|During the winter, {{they played}} {{baseball}} for the Fitzroy Baseball Club, often competing in matches played as curtain raisers {{to the elite}} Australian rules football competition, the Victorian Football League. In 1948, Harvey was selected at short stop in the 1948 All-Australian baseball team. Saturday night entertainment for the family typically consisted of dinner after the day’s cricket matches for Fitzroy and Plant, Liddicut and other club personnel were often invited. Under the influence of cricketing mentors Plant and Liddicut, the boys were taught to adopt an aggressive approach, using fast feet movement to attack spin bowling in particular. Harvey made his First XI debut for Fitzroy in 1941–42. In 1943–44, he scored a club record of 817 First XI runs in a season. In 1942–43, Neil was promoted to Fitzroy's First XI, joining Merv, Mick and Ray. During that season, the family <b>held</b> <b>down</b> the first four batting positions for Fitzroy; Merv and Mick opened the batting and Ray and Neil came in after them. Ray continued to play for Fitzroy {{over the next two}} decades when he was not required by Victoria. Outside cricket, Harvey was an electrical fitter and he worked for the Metropolitan Tramways Board. He and his wife Lorna and settled in the inner-northern suburb of Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|The female may {{be offered}} food by the male during {{courtship}}. He has a brief courtship display {{in which the}} neck is extended and the head <b>held</b> <b>down,</b> the tail is fanned, and the wings are spread with the tips touching the ground. He will then attempt to approach the female from behind, and then leap on her back to copulate. The nest is typically in grassland, sometimes in safer sites along a hedge, or near an isolated tree or bush, or in overgrown vegetation. Where grass is not tall enough {{at the start of}} the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill. The nest, well hidden in the grass, is built in a scrape or hollow in the ground. It is made of woven coarse dry grass and other plants, and lined with finer grasses. Although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female, a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest.|$|E
