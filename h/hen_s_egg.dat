40|$|Influenza remains due to {{its annual}} death rate and {{potential}} to cause pandemics a major public health concern. Efforts to control the annual spread of influenza have centered on prophylactic vaccinations. Human influenza vaccines are traditionally produced in embryonated <b>hen</b> <b>s</b> <b>eggs.</b> However, major constraints with this method, e. g. allergic reactions induced by egg proteins and lack of scalability have {{lead to the development}} of cell culture based production processes. In recent years, several continuous cell lines such as the Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) or the African green monkey kidney Vero cells have been successfully established for the production of influenza vaccines in cell culture. These processes require the modification of existing but also the development of new downstream strategies to account for the changed upstream technology. Downstream processing of biological products is conventionally subdivided into three steps: capture or concentration, separation or fractionation and polishing. The capture step is commonly the most expensive unit operation. Hence, the efficiency of this step has a large impact on the total process economics. The presented study focuses on the development of a proficient capture step based on lectin-affinity chromatography. Lectins are a class of carbohydrate specific proteins of non-immune origin that have a selective affinity for a carbohydrate or a group of carbohydrates. Immobilized lectins have been used successfully for many years to separate and isolate glycoconjugates, polysaccharides, soluble cell components, and cells containing glycoproteins with specific carbohydrate structures on its surface. The influenza A virus contains two spike glycoproteins on its surface: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is the most abundant surface protein. It is a trimeric glycoprotein containing per subunit 3 to 9 N-linked glycosylation sites depending on the viral strain. Here the influenza A/PR/ 8 / 34 virus has been selected as a model. The HA molecule of this particular virus contains according to the NetNGlyc 1. 0 Server prediction six glycosylation sites. Detailed analysis of these sites and their individual glycan structures are presently performed. Based on preliminary structural glycan analysis studies and literature data several HA-binding lectins are selected for a pre-screening via lectin-blots. The most promising lectinblot results are obtained from lectins specific for terminal galactose e. g. Erythrina cristagalli (ECL), Arachis hypogaea (PNA). Lectins, by which lectin-blot analysis suggests an interaction with viral membrane proteins, are currently screened for their suitability as an affinity matrix ligand. Therefore, centrifuged cultivation broths of influenza A/PR/ 8 / 34 virus infected MDCK cells are applied to various agaroseimmobilized lectins. Components interfering with the immobilized lectins are selectively adsorbed. Non or weak binding components are washed from the column. Subsequently, bound components are dissociated from the lectin by competitive elution with suitable hapten carbohydrates. This fraction contains the influenza virus particles and virally encoded membrane proteins, which have to be further processed for vaccine manufacturing. The extend of the subsequent purification depends on the specificity of the lectin binding to virally encoded surface proteins. Lectins with weak or no interaction with host cell proteins or medium components and strong interaction with viral membrane glycoproteins represent a powerful tool to concentrate and purify viral surface proteins from contaminating nucleic acids, medium components, and non-virally encoded host cell proteins...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} three cooking methods on the chemical, physical, and sensory prop-erties of hard-cooked eggs were investigated. Freshly laid eggs were stored at 23 C for 48 hr and then hard cooked {{by one of}} three methods: {{steaming}} (S) for 20 min; severe boiling (B) procedure (water brought to a full boil and maintained for 20 min); and a standard hard cook (SHC) pro-cedure (water brought to a slow boil followed by 20 min simmer). The eggs were peeled, separated into yolk and white, and evaluated for pH, moisture, color, texture by an Instron Texturometer and texture profile panel, and flavor by a trained profile panel, experienced panel, and headspace gas chromatography. Eggs subjected to the B procedure had the highest endpoint temperature (98. 7 C) followed by SHC (95. 6 C) and <b>S</b> <b>eggs</b> (89. 4 C). The cooking rate for <b>S</b> <b>eggs</b> was approximately three times faster than SHC or B eggs. Both egg white moisture and pH values were significantly influenced by cooking method. Severely boiled egg whites had significantly lower pH moisture values than SHC or <b>S</b> <b>eggs.</b> Small but perceivable texture differences due to cooking were found by the texture profile panel in addition to significant egg white and yolk texture differences as measured using the Instron. Severely boiled egg whites had the firmest texture followed by SHC and <b>S</b> <b>egg</b> whites.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} different concentrations of Schistosoma japonicum (<b>S.</b> japonicum) <b>egg</b> antigen on fibrogenesis and apoptosis in primary hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). METHODS: A mouse model of schistosomiasis-associated liver fibrosis (SSLF) was established by infecting mice with schistosomal cercaria via the abdomen. HSCs were isolated from SSLF mice by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation, and their identity was confirmed by immunofluorescence double staining of &#x 3 B 1;-smooth muscle actin (&#x 3 B 1;-SMA) and desmin. The growth inhibitory effect and 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of <b>S.</b> japonicum <b>egg</b> antigen for primary HSCs (24 h) were determined using a cell counting kit- 8 (CCK- 8) assay. The expression levels of &#x 3 B 1;-SMA, matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMOL/LP- 9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- 1 (TIMP- 1) in HSCs in response to different concentrations of <b>S.</b> japonicum <b>egg</b> antigen were detected by Western blotting and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The levels of phospho-P 38 (P-P 38), phospho-Jun N-terminal kinase (P-JNK) and phospho-Akt (P-AKT) in HSCs were detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: An SSLF mouse model was established, and primary HSCs were successfully isolated and cultured. <b>S.</b> japonicum <b>egg</b> antigen inhibited HSC proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC 50 of the <b>S.</b> japonicum <b>egg</b> antigen was 244. 53 1; 35. 26 &#x 3 BC;g/mL. <b>S.</b> japonicum <b>egg</b> antigen enhanced &#x 3 B 1;-SMA expression at both the mRNA and protein levels and enhanced TIMP- 1 expression at the mRNA level in HSCs (P < 0. 05), whereas the expression of MMOL/LP- 9 was attenuated at both the mRNA and protein levels in a concentration-dependent manner (P < 0. 05). A high concentration of <b>S.</b> japonicum <b>egg</b> antigen enhanced P-P 38, P-JNK and P-AKT activation (P < 0. 05). The changes in &#x 3 B 1;-SMA and MMOL/LP- 9 expression induced by <b>S.</b> japonicum <b>egg</b> antigen were closely correlated with P-P 38 and P-JNK activation (P < 0. 05). The attenuation of MMOL/LP- 9 was also correlated with P-AKT activation (P < 0. 05), but the increase in &#x 3 B 1;-SMA expression was not. TIMP- 1 expression was not correlated with P-P 38, P-JNK or P-AKT activation.

Mean lifespan and fecundity of parasitoids that had developed in H. armigera eggs and were exposed to H. armigera eggs for oviposition were 13. 9 +/- 1. 8 days and 98. 7 +/- 11. 0 adult offspring. By contrast, those that developed in <b>S.</b> litura <b>eggs</b> and were exposed to <b>S.</b> litura <b>eggs</b> for oviposition lived for 7 +/- 0. 9 days and produced 53. 8 +/- 8. 0 adult offspring.
