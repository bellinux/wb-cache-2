5|$|The {{intermetallic}} compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements (aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium), such as NaTl, are poor conductors or semiconductors, unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements, {{implying that the}} alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the Zintl anions involved. Nevertheless, while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters, group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant <b>ionic</b> <b>lattice.</b> For example, NaTl consists of a polymeric anion (—Tl−—)n with a covalent diamond cubic structure with Na+ ions located between the anionic lattice. The larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form anionic clusters.|$|E
5|$|The {{solubility}} {{is highest}} in polar solvents (such as water) or ionic liquids, but {{tends to be}} low in nonpolar solvents (such as petrol/gasoline). This is principally because the resulting ion–dipole interactions are significantly stronger than ion-induced dipole interactions, so the heat of solution is higher. When the oppositely charged ions in the solid <b>ionic</b> <b>lattice</b> are surrounded by the opposite pole of a polar molecule, the solid ions are {{pulled out of the}} lattice and into the liquid. If the solvation energy exceeds the lattice energy, the negative net enthalpy change of solution provides a thermodynamic drive to remove ions from their positions in the crystal and dissolve in the liquid. In addition, the entropy change of solution is usually positive for most solid solutes like ionic compounds, which means that their solubility increases when the temperature increases. There are some unusual ionic compounds such as cerium(III) sulfate, where this entropy change is negative, due to extra order induced in the water upon solution, and the solubility decreases with temperature.|$|E
25|$|In {{a normal}} conductor, an {{electric}} current may be visualized as a fluid of electrons moving across a heavy <b>ionic</b> <b>lattice.</b> The electrons are constantly colliding with the ions in the lattice, and during each collision {{some of the}} energy carried by the current is absorbed by the lattice and converted into heat, which is essentially the vibrational kinetic energy of the lattice ions.

50|$|Enthalpy of {{solvation}} {{can help}} explain why solvation occurs with some <b>ionic</b> <b>lattices</b> but not with others. The difference in energy between that which is necessary to release an ion from its lattice and the energy given off when it combines with a solvent molecule is called the enthalpy change of solution. A negative value for the enthalpy change of solution corresponds to an ion {{that is likely to}} dissolve, whereas a high positive value means that solvation will not occur. It is possible that an ion will dissolve even if it has a positive enthalpy value. The extra energy required comes from the increase in entropy that results when the ion dissolves. The introduction of entropy makes it harder to determine by calculation alone whether a substance will dissolve or not. A quantitative measure for solvation power of solvents is given by donor numbers.|$|R
500|$|The smaller {{alkali metals}} tend to {{polarise}} the larger anions (the peroxide and superoxide) {{due to their}} small size. This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom. This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature. This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable peroxides. Rubidium and caesium, {{at the bottom of}} the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form. Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised. (The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist, but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions.) In addition, the small size of the Li+ and O2− ions contributes to their forming a stable <b>ionic</b> <b>lattice</b> structure. Under controlled conditions, however, all the alkali metals, with the exception of francium, are known to form their oxides, peroxides, and superoxides. The alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful oxidising agents. Sodium peroxide and potassium superoxide react with carbon dioxide to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas, which allows them to be used in submarine air purifiers; the presence of water vapour, naturally present in breath, makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient. All the stable alkali metals except lithium can form red ozonides (MO3) through low-temperature reaction of the powdered anhydrous hydroxide with ozone: the ozonides may be then extracted using liquid ammonia. They slowly decompose at standard conditions to the superoxides and oxygen, and hydrolyse immediately to the hydroxides when in contact with water. Potassium, rubidium, and caesium also form sesquioxides M2O3, which may be better considered peroxide disuperoxides, [...]|$|E

40|$|Restricted AccessA new {{mechanism}} is proposed for relaxation processes in ferrimngnetic insulators (assumed to be ionic e. g. yttrium iron garnet, YIC;), whereby magnons of the optical spin wave branch couple {{directly with the}} transverse optical modes of lattice vibrations which are, energetically, “on speaking terms”.

40|$|We {{construct}} the simplest gravitational dual {{model of a}} superconductor on Q-lattices. We analyze the condition {{for the existence of}} a critical temperature at which the charged scalar field will condense. In contrast to the holographic superconductor on <b>ionic</b> <b>lattices,</b> the presence of Q-lattices will suppress the condensate of the scalar field and lower the critical temperature. In particular, when the Q-lattice background is dual to a deep insulating phase, the condensation would never occur for some small charges. Furthermore, we numerically compute the optical conductivity in the superconducting regime. It turns out that the presence of Q-lattice does not remove the pole in the imaginary part of the conductivity, ensuring the appearance of a delta function in the real part. We also evaluate the gap which in general depends on the charge of the scalar field as well as the Q-lattice parameters. Nevertheless, when the charge of the scalar field is relatively large and approaches the probe limit, the gap becomes universal with ω_g ≃ 9 T_c which is consistent with the result for conventional holographic superconductors.

40|$|Quasiparticles in {{the vortex}} lattice of {{strongly}} type-II superconductors are investigated {{by means of}} a singular gauge transformation applied to the tight binding lattice Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian. We present a detailed derivation of the gauge invariant effective low energy Hamiltonian for the quasiparticle-vortex system and show how the physics of the "Doppler shift" and "Berry phase" can be incorporated at the Hamiltonian level by working in the singular gauge. In particular, we show that the "Berry phase" effect manifests itself in the effective Hamiltonian through a half-flux Aharonov-Bohm scattering of quasiparticles off vortices and stress the important role that this effect plays in the quasiparticle dynamics. Full numerical solutions in the regime of intermediate fields H_c 1 <<B<<H_c 2 are presented for model superconductors with s-, p- and d-wave symmetries and with square and triangular vortex lattices. For s- and p-wave cases we obtain low energy bound states in the core, in agreement with the existing results. For d-wave case only extended quasiparticle states exist. We investigate in detail the nature of these extended states and provide comparison to the previous results within linearized ``Dirac fermion'' model. We also investigate internodal interference effects when vortex and <b>ionic</b> <b>lattices</b> have high degree of commensurability and discuss various specific choices for the singular gauge transformation.

40|$|The noncollinear {{cycloidal}} magnetic order {{breaks the}} inversion symmetry in CaMn_ 7 O_ 12, generating {{one of the}} largest spin-orbit driven ferroelectric polarizations measured to date. In this Letter, the microscopic origin of the polarization, including its direction, charge density redistribution, magnetic exchange interactions, and its coupling to the spin helicity, is explored via first principles calculations. The Berry phase computed polarization exhibits almost pure electronic behavior, as the Mn displacements are negligible, ≈ 0. 7 mÅ. The polarization magnitude and direction are both determined by the Mn spin current, where the p-d orbital mixing is driven by the inequivalent exchange interactions within the B-site Mn cycloidal spiral chains along each Cartesian direction.

This study explored general chemistry students' thinking processes about molecular polarity and related concepts. The study employed a mixed-method design to reveal how general chemistry students use their conceptual frameworks and mental models to solve problems about molecular polarity. The quantitative phase collected students' background information, scores of course exams, as well as understanding and misconceptions about concepts of molecular geometry, polarity, and prerequisite concepts for a large sample size. The qualitative phase was guided by a theoretical framework of personal constructivism and a case study methodology. The primary data sources were video-taped interviews to document students' explanations and thinking processes. The secondary data sources were students' constructed artifacts and their responses to the items on the three diagnostic instruments. Grounded theory approach, employing a comparative method, was used for data analysis. Findings of the quantitative study indicated results of inferential statistics and identified students' misconceptions associated with concepts of electronegativity, chemical bonding, bond polarity, molecular shape, polarity of molecules, intermolecular force, and <b>ionic</b> <b>lattices.</b> For qualitative findings, I characterized high-, moderate-, and low-scoring students' mental-modeling ability, conceptual frameworks, and features of mental models while solving problems about molecular geometry and polarity. The major findings include that there is a positive interaction between an individual's level of content knowledge and mental-modeling ability, where one may facilitate or hinder the other. In addition, three prerequisite concepts were identified that may explain students' failure for learning about molecular geometry and polarity. I also found that metacognitive ability plays a significant role in a successful mental-modeling process. This study provides empirical evidence for how students' content knowledge, mental-modeling ability, and construction and use of mental models influence their understanding about molecular polarity. The findings have implications for college chemistry education for teaching concepts of molecular polarity...|$|R
40|$|Several {{models of}} the diffuse double layer in liquid {{electrolytes}} are discussed. These models all involve partitioning the space charge region {{into a number of}} planar layers parallel to the metal electrode, with <b>ionic</b> liquid <b>lattice</b> gas, as opposed to idea gas, response in each layer.

A layer model involving Liu’s original assumptions of point ionic charges and point dipoles is discussed in detail and is shown to be electrostatically inconsistent. It is replaced by a layer model in which ionic charge resides on each basic layer, with each such layer surrounded symmetrically by charge layers representing the effect of finite-extent permanent dipoles.
