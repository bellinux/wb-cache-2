40|$|This report {{describes}} a project on an implementation plan of hotfill <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> <b>washing</b> machines and dishwashers in domestic dwellings in The Netherlands, United Kingdom and Greece. The project consisted of five actions. 1. Market {{analysis of the}} situation concerning hotfill was made for the three countries. 2. market survey among whitegood manufacturers. 3. inventing through which channels and by which means the consumer can be encouraged to choose hotfill equipment when purchasing these sort of appliances. 4. to develop a hotfill sticker in addition to the EU labelling system. 5. regional pilot actions in the countries mentioned above. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to {{organize}} a campaign {{in order to support}} the implemention of hot fill equipment. Implementation of hot fill <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> <b>washing</b> machines, dishwashers, in the next five years, penetration through adaptation of housing installations and replacement and new equipment. With the implementation key-players of the whole chain are involved: whitegood industry, installers of housing installations, building specifiers and energy agencies, such as C. R. E. S., Novem and of utilities. Hot fill equipment for whitegood, such as washing machines and dishwashers is an existing technology. For different reasons hot fill washing machines are current practice in United Kingdom, but not in other European countries, like The Netherlands and Greece. The main environment benefits are: - Reduced primary energy use, due to the shift from electricity use tonatural gas, renewable energy sources or district heating. - Reduced emissions of CO 2 and reduced acidification. - Enlarged potential for solar domestic hot water systems. ...|$|E
40|$|Filling silo at the Ralph Harwood Farm at 285 W. Textile Road, Pittsfield Township. Men unknown, but {{probably}} neighbors. Harvesting, whether wheat, oats or corn, {{was always a}} cooperative effort.; The only paid person {{would have been the}} owner of the required machinery, i. e., the threshing machine or silo (corn grinding) filling mechanisms. Farm wives, daughters, and, if fortunate, hired "girls" cooked and baked for 20 - 30 men, very hungry! <b>Equipment</b> <b>for</b> <b>washing</b> their hands and faces had to be provided, generally outdoors in the shade. Generally very nice men, appreciative, and thanked the "ladies". Always exciting days when you awakened {{to the sound of the}} machinery coming into the driveway and the neighboring farmers arrived, each bearing his own fork, or other necessary accessory. Throughout the morning there was hustling in the kitchen, accompanied with delicious aromas - pies, peeling zillions of potatoes and baked beans. Fresh lemonade and cookies for afternoons. Threshing rules: Never alcoholic beverages! Too dangerous around machines. If so, sent home! Smoking only at lunchtime...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work is to assess the {{possibility}} of preparation of poor washability, high-ash coals demonstrated by the example of the Apsat deposit. The following tasks have been accomplished. The analysis of modern <b>equipment</b> produced <b>for</b> <b>washing</b> of large classes of coal: heavy-medium separators and jigging machines. The most preferred were the heavy-media separator SKVP, jigging machines ROMJIG and BATAC. The analysis of mathematical models of processes and technologies of gravitational processing for determining the yield and ash content of the concentrate has been carried out. Algorithms and computer programs have been developed in which two mathematical models of the processes of heavy-media preparation and jigging machines have been used that allow determination of the separation densities at which the maximum yield of the total concentrate of the required ash content is reached. The computational experiment carried out showed that in processing of high ash diluted coals with poor washability, it is expedient to use SKVP separator and a jigging machine ROMJIG...|$|R
30|$|In many {{industrial}} production settings, e.g. in the beverage industry, setup conditions are considerably complex and {{the assignment of}} setup costs and times to a specific product may become a difficult task. As an example, consider blow-moulding machines which represent the recent technology for bottling of beverages like mineral water or fruit juices. This kind of machinery is set up for a specific shape and size of plastic bottles by mounting the required moulds into the processing head of the machine. The actual plastic bottles are formed on the machine from compact pre-forms through thermal and high-air pressure processes. Depending on {{the configuration of the}} machine, around 20 moulding devices are arranged on a rotary turret thus allowing a respective number of bottles to be produced on the fly. Due to the high-pressure filling capabilities of the machine, 15 – 20, 000 plastic bottles of one-litre size can be filled per hour. Auxiliary <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> bottle <b>washing,</b> capping and labelling is integrated into the line as well as packaging machines for the generation of unit loads used in retail stores or transportation. Once the line is set up for a specific type of bottle, a variety of beverages can be filled with only a minor changeover between the different product types.|$|R

Pressurized hydration bladders {{are used}} {{in some cases to}} provide a stream powerful enough to effectively wash with, or the bladder may be suspended from a high place such as a tree branch to employ gravity in generating water pressure.|$|R
40|$|The Dengue IgM Capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA) is the immunoenzymatic system {{recommended}} by the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization for the serological diagnosis of dengue virus infection due to its high sensitivity, ease of performance, and use of a single acute-phase serum sample. However, tests with this enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system are time-consuming and require <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> <b>washing,</b> incubation, and reading of the results. AuBioDOT is a multistep visual diagnostic immunoassay that uses technology based on the immunoglobulin M (IgM) capture ELISA principle. This system uses white polyethylene opaque plates as the solid phase, colloidal gold as the marker, and silver ion amplification. It does not require special equipment, it is totally manually operated, {{and it can be}} performed in less than 1 h. The sensitivity and specificity of AuBioDOT for the detection of anti-dengue virus IgM antibodies were studied with a panel of 336 serum samples (150 serum samples from patients with suspected or serologically confirmed dengue virus infection, 186 serum samples from healthy blood donors and patients without dengue virus infection). The results were compared with those obtained by the MAC-ELISA. A sensitivity of 97. 7 % and a specificity of 97. 1 % were obtained. The concordance of the two tests was 97. 3 %, with a kappa index of 0. 94. The application of AuBioDOT for the detection of anti-dengue virus IgM antibodies is recommended as an alternative method for the diagnosis of dengue virus infection, both for clinical diagnosis and for seroepidemiological surveillance. The system is useful under field conditions and in laboratories and requires little equipment...|$|E
