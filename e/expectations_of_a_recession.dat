40|$|World {{economic}} growth has slowed {{in the first}} months of 2008. The main causes are the crisis in the US housing sector and the turmoil in the financial sector in general, the spreading <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> in the US, and sharply rising prices for energy and food. The German economy, though, is still expanding healthily, with strong investment and export activities. Private consumption, however, shrank at the end of 2007. In 2008, while favorable labor market conditions will improve job security and thus the propensity to consume, real incomes will not rise by much due to the risen inflation rate; consumption will again expand only modestly this year. <b>A</b> slower expansion <b>of</b> the world economy and the stronger euro will dampen exports and investment. All in all, growth will slow to (working-day adjusted) 1. 2 % in 2008. Chances are good that in the next year, after the negative shocks have faded out a bit, growth will be accelerating again. The East German Economy was on a lower growth path in 2006 and 2007 than the economy in the West, according to recently revised national accounts data. Industrial production, however, is more dynamic in the East. Unemployment rates will continue to decrease faster in the East: as in the rest of Germany, employment is growing, and, contrary to what happens in the West, the labor force is shrinking. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{recession}} of 1953 was demand-driven because the dramatic changes {{of interest rates}} {{earlier in the year}} led to an increase in pessimism towards the economy which led to a decrease in aggregate demand. Before the Federal Reserve stepped in to increase availability of reserves, the increase in interest rates continued to decrease aggregate demand. And finally, the actions of the Federal Reserve led to an increase in consumer <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inevitable <b>recession</b> which led to an even further drop in aggregate demand and an increase in savings. Thus, the {{recession of}} 1953 began on the demand side. The sharp three quarter decline with a clear trough, followed by a sharp recovery means that the 1953 <b>recession</b> is <b>an</b> exampled <b>of</b> <b>a</b> V-shaped <b>recession.</b>|$|R
40|$|For decades, many {{financial}} {{economists have}} suspected that an inverted yield curve predicts recession. This paper explores {{the accuracy of}} this belief by testing multiple variables and seeing if they result in <b>a</b> <b>recession.</b> The dependent variable tested is probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recession; independent variables tested are: three-month Treasury-bill minus ten-year Treasury note; controls include: three-month Treasury-bill yield to maturity, ten-year Treasury-note yield to maturity, number of months since last recession, equal-weighted return on the S 2 ̆ 6 P 500, value-weighted return minus equal-weighted return, return on the S 2 ̆ 6 P 500, rate of inflation, and {{the interaction between the}} difference between the three-month Treasury-bill and the ten-year Treasury-note. The null hypothesis {{is that there is no}} relationship between the variables and the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession.</b> Failing to reject the null illustrates that there is a relationship between the inverted yield curve and the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession.</b> Using logistic regression models, I find that when the previous month is not part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession,</b> we fail to reject the null hypothesis because there is a relationship between the inverted yield curve and the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession.</b> Consequently, the inverted yield curve is like â€˜famine, the third horsemen of the apocalypse. â€™ My model shows that all the other variables are significant in revealing that the inverted yield curve is not the only predictor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession...</b>|$|R

Typically, these dates correspond to peaks and troughs in real GDP, although not always so.|$|R
40|$|I compare {{unemployment}} expectations {{from the}} Michigan Survey of Consumers to VAR forecastable movements in unemployment. I document three key facts. First, one-half to {{one-third of the}} population expects unemployment to rise when it is falling at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> even though the VAR predicts the fall in unemployment. Second, more people expect unemployment to rise when it is falling at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> than expect it to rise when it is rising at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> even though the VAR predicts these changes. Finally, the lag change in unemployment is almost {{as important as the}} VAR forecast in predicting the fraction of the population that expects unemployment to rise. Professional forecasters do not make these mistakes. Least squares learning or real time expectations do little to help explain these facts. However, delayed updating <b>of</b> <b>expectations</b> can explain some of these facts and extrapolative expectations explains these facts best. Individuals with higher income or education are only slightly less likely to make these expectational errors and those who makes these errors are 8 - 10 percent less likely to believe it {{is a good time to}} make a major purchase.

40|$|In {{the article}} it is shown that current {{definitions}} of economic recessions are unsatisfactory.

Another often used ‘technical definition’ <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> takes into account only quarter-to-quarter changes in real GDP without considering changes in population, so in some cases economy can be in recession while real GDP per capita is actually increasing, and vice versa.

40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{beyond the}} prediction of the probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> by also considering its severity in terms of output loss and duration. First, Probit models are used to estimate the probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> at period t + h from the information available at period t. Next, a Vector Autoregression (VAR) augmented with diffusion indices and an inverse Mills ratio (IMR) is fitted to selected measures of real economic activity. The latter model is used to generate two forecasts: an average forecast, and a forecast under pessimistic assumption that <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> occurs at the forecast horizon. The severity of recessions is then predicted as the gap between these two forecasts. Finally, a zero-inflated Poisson model is fitted to historical durations of recessions. Our empirical results suggest that U. S. recessions are fairly predictable, {{both in terms of}} occurrence and severity. Out-of-sample experiments suggest that the inclusion of the IMR in the VAR model significantly improves its forecasting performance...|$|R
