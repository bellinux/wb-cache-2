One Kansas Territory source, recounting Kansas history up to 1855, states that Kansas, {{as part of}} the {{district}} of Louisiana, was not only administered by but also [...] "annexed to" [...] Indiana Territory. Whether a temporary act can effect an annexation may depend on its actual duration, and most sources have declined to call Indiana Territory administration an annexation or even to use [...] "annexed to" [...] language. Less persuasively, maps generally fail to reflect the de jure common governance of Indiana Territory and the istrict of Louisiana by way of, say, a common color scheme and/or a <b>dotted</b> <b>border.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} quantized spin wave spectrum in tangentially magnetized cylindrical thin magnetic dots. Low energy spin waves in magnetic dots may be subdivided into four families: Damon-Eshbach-like, backward-like, mixed and end modes. Frequencies and mode profiles are found using a variational approach based on carefully chosen trial functions. The variational method has the advantage {{that it can be}} used for large dots that are not practical to treat using numerical finite element methods. Results for small dots generated using the variational method compare well with micromagnetic results. The variational method is demonstrated with an analysis of data obtained from experimental Brillouin Light Scattering data from saturated thin cylindrical Permalloy dots. Our approach allows for the definition of parameters describing important contributions to the spin wave energies. As an example, we show that a variational parameter epsilon provides a measure of spin wave localization near the <b>dot</b> <b>border</b> for one class of modes...|$|R
5000|$|Yellow Air Taxi (a {{marketing}} name of Friendship Airways) was an {{air taxi}} airline based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It operated on-demand passenger services in the Southeast, Florida, the Caribbean and, the Bahamas. YAT grew from a small operation out of Pompano Beach to a fleet of 4 Cessna 402Cs, all painted in yellow with a white/black checkerboard tail. The carrier had some issues with the US <b>DOT,</b> <b>bordering</b> on offering scheduled service as a charter airline. [...] Once legal to fly more than 4 flights a week, YAT expanded to Naples & Key West, along with offering 3 flights a day to Marsh Harbour & Treasure Cay from Ft. Lauderdale. Miami service was attempted in 2009. YAT started being affected by the high-seasonality of both the Florida Keys & Bahamas and the carrier relinquished their scheduled authority in 2009. Yellow Air Taxi has since gone out of business. On February 18, 2011, an involuntary petition for liquidation under Chapter 7 was filed against Friendship Airways Inc.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Today barcode {{system is}} very popular to {{protecting}} sensitive information. Many organizations are using this technique for protecting sensitive information. This paper presents an algorithm for hiding of data using 2 D matrix code for high level of security. The proposed algorithm uses some modified definition of support and confidence {{so that it would}} hide any desired sensitive association rule without any side effect. Actually the enhanced technique is using the same method (as previously used method) of getting association rules but modified definitions of support and confidence are used Data Matrix is a matrix (2 D or two-dimensional) bar code which may be printed as a square or rectangular symbol made up of individual dots or squares. This representation is an ordered grid of dark and light <b>dots</b> <b>bordered</b> by a finder pattern. The finder pattern is partly used to specify the orientation and structure of the symbol. The data is encoded using a series of dark or light dots based upon a pre-determined size. The minimum size of these dots is known as the X-dimension...|$|R

Superficial lung abscesses in eight sheep appeared as anechoic areas containing multiple hyperechoic <b>dots</b> <b>bordered</b> distally by a broad hyperechoic capsule. Unilateral fibrinous pleurisy (2 sheep) appeared as an anechoic area containing a hyperechoic latticework. Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA) lesions appeared as sharply demarcated hypoechoic areas in the lung parenchyma initially in the cranioventral lung lobes (21 sheep) with lesions also present in the caudodorsal diaphragmatic lobe (11 sheep); abscesses and areas of calcification within the OPA tumour mass were also identified. Daily treatment with procaine penicillin for 30 consecutive days was successful in both sheep with unilateral fibrinous pleurisy and six sheep identified with superficial lung abscesses measuring 2 – 8 [*]cm in diameter; only one of two sheep with more extensive lesions recovered. Auscultation of the chest failed to detect adventitious sounds {{in any of the}} ten sheep with lung abscesses; normal breath sounds were reduced over the area of fibrinous pleurisy; no pleuritic rubs were heard.
