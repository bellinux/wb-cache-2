40|$|This study makes {{substantial}} {{contributions to}} both the theoretical and computational treatment of information structure, with a specific focus on creating natural language processing applications such as multilingual machine translation systems. The present study first provides cross-linguistic findings in regards to <b>information</b> structure meanings <b>and</b> <b>markings.</b> Building upon such findings, the current model represents information structure within the HPSG/MRS framework using Individual Constraints. The primary goal {{of the present study}} is to create a multilingual grammar model of information structure for the LinGO Grammar Matrix system. The present study explores the construction of a grammar library for creating customized grammar incorporating <b>information</b> structure <b>and</b> illustrates how the information structure-based model improves performance of transfer-based machine translation...|$|R
30|$|Second, {{while driving}} speed is {{definitely}} the predominant measure for consideration around schools, the selection of appropriate traffic control devices should also consider other factors, such as visibility, legibility, and comprehension. All of these signs <b>and</b> <b>markings</b> are explicitly defined in China’s Road Traffic Signs <b>and</b> <b>Markings</b> Manual (2009). Since {{a thorough understanding of}} traffic signs <b>and</b> <b>markings</b> is one of the prerequisites for obtaining a driver’s license, we assumed that all drivers are familiar with the signs <b>and</b> <b>markings.</b> Consequently, we did not evaluate drivers’ cognitive ability. Certainly, if possible, the legibility of signs <b>and</b> <b>markings</b> <b>and</b> drivers’ cognitive ability should be studied in further research.|$|R

The aim of the present dissertation is to create a gram-mar library of information structure for the LinGO Grammar Matrix system (Bender et al. 2010 b). Information structure consists of focus, topic, contrast, and background, and refers to how speakers package semantic content they wish to convey to listeners. The information structure of individual sentences is crucial to understanding the cohesiveness of larger segments of text. Despite the crucial role information structure plays in conveying meaning, there is insufficient research on how compu-tational language models might successfully incorporate information structure marking particularly from a multilingual perspective. Part I introduces the current study, and gives some background information. Part II provides cross-linguistic findings about <b>information</b> structure meanings <b>and</b> <b>markings.</b> Part III exploits a naturally occurring text in four languages (e. g. English, Spanish, Rus-sian, and Korean) to formulate a cross-linguistic generalization about distributional properties of information structure. Drawing from these cross-linguistic findings, Part IV shows how information structure can be represented within the HPSG/MRS framework (Pollard and Sag, 1994; Copestak...|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 35 mm {{for males and}} 47 mm for females. The forewing upperside is predominantly light brown or greyish brown with small black <b>and</b> white <b>markings</b> <b>and</b> pale fawn or greyish-fawn striations, which follow the veins. The hindwing upperside is yellowish orange with blackish spots <b>and</b> <b>markings</b> <b>and</b> a silvery-grey basal area. On their undersides, the forewings and hindwings are shades of pale whitish-orange with a few blackish spots <b>and</b> <b>markings.</b> A number of morphs occur, commonly named the pale morph, Terrick Terrick morph, Nhill morph, narrow-winged morph, dark morph and Two Wells morph.|$|R
30|$|In this research, {{the speed}} of each subject was {{measured}} in a dynamic simulated environment, {{and there were a}} few differences between the real world and the dynamic simulated environment. In future research, we could validate these findings by comparing the speed in the real world before and after installations of the relatively best design alternative. In addition, we did not study the effect of each sign or marking, but used design alternatives consisting of different signs <b>and</b> <b>markings.</b> A further <b>and</b> more thorough study could be done to classify the signs <b>and</b> <b>markings</b> <b>and</b> determine which signs <b>and</b> <b>markings</b> should be deployed for different types of schools.|$|R
