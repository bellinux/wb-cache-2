5|$|Land use <b>is</b> <b>mixed.</b> The land to {{the extreme}} north {{adjacent}} to the river is mostly industrial, split by the Felling By-Pass. The land south of the By-Pass towards the town centre is predominantly residential and includes the Nest, Brandling, Stoneygate and the Old Fold estates. Centrally the land <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> between residential properties and the largely commercial use at Crowhall Lane and Victoria Square. At High Felling, land use is predominantly residential but there is around 25% green-space, including a park, cricket ground and urban open space to the south at Albion Street.|$|E
5|$|Although the Saturn {{is remembered}} for several well-regarded games, {{including}} Nights into Dreams, the Panzer Dragoon series, and the Virtua Fighter series, its reputation <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> {{due to its}} complex hardware design and limited third-party support. Sega's management {{has been criticized for}} its decision-making during the system's development and discontinuation.|$|E
5000|$|Tracks may <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> a {{group at}} a time, {{in a process}} called predubbing. All of the tracks {{containing}} dialogue may <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> at one time, {{and all of the}} tracks containing foley may <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> at another time. In the process of predubbing, many tracks can <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> into one.|$|R

5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{concerns}} women is {{the dress code}} expected of them. Islam requires {{both men and women}} to dress modestly; this concept is known as hijab and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments. There <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> opinion among feminists over extremes of externally imposed control. Women from other religions are also expected to follow dress codes.|$|E
5|$|As with Boumba-Bek to the northeast, {{the main}} type of forest is semi-evergreen {{with an open}} canopy {{dominated}} by the 50–60 m Triplochiton, though it <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> with large patches of closed evergreens. There are also some seasonally flooded Uapaca trees along the Dja River.|$|E
5|$|For the {{production}} of ferromanganese, the manganese ore <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> with iron ore and carbon, and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace. The resulting ferromanganese has a manganese content of 30 to 80%. Pure manganese used for {{the production}} of iron-free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, the {{granular}} pavement {{section of}} Highway 2 south of Watrous was tested {{with a cold}} in-place recycling or “CIR” method to rehabilitate highways. This CIR process is a cost-effective method which recycles the top surface of a road. This pulverized material <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> with asphalt emulsion and spread and compacted back onto the highway surface. This surface is then recovered with a new seal dependent on traffic volume.|$|E
5|$|In Ghana, FES is brewed in Kumasi by Guinness Ghana Breweries, {{which is}} 50.5 per cent owned by Diageo. GFE <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> with a locally brewed sorghum lager, but it {{differs from the}} Nigerian version in that it {{contains}} no wheat and has {{a higher proportion of}} roast barley. In Ghana, the product is believed to have medicinal properties, strengthening the blood and improving circulation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} moment after an enzyme <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> with substrate, no product has been formed and no {{intermediates}} exist. The study of the next few milliseconds of the reaction is called pre-steady-state kinetics. Pre-steady-state kinetics is therefore concerned with the formation and consumption of enzyme–substrate intermediates (such as ES or E*) until their steady-state concentrations are reached.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} of selenium usually involves {{the extraction of}} selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper. Common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce selenium dioxide, which <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> with water and acidified to form selenous acid (oxidation step). Selenous acid is bubbled with sulfur dioxide (reduction step) to give elemental selenium.|$|E
5|$|Krypton <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> with argon {{in energy}} {{efficient}} fluorescent lamps, reducing the power consumption, but also reducing the light output {{and raising the}} cost. Krypton costs about 100 {{times as much as}} argon. Krypton (along with xenon) is also used to fill incandescent lamps to reduce filament evaporation and allow higher operating temperatures. A brighter light results with more blue color than conventional incandescent lamps.|$|E

40|$|The natural {{invertible}} extension T* of an Nd-action T {{has been}} studied by Lacroix. He showed that T* may fail to <b>be</b> <b>mixing</b> even if T <b>is</b> <b>mixing</b> for d ³ 2. We extend this observation by showing that if T <b>is</b> <b>mixing</b> on (k+ 1) sets then T* <b>is</b> in general <b>mixing</b> on no more than k sets, simply because Nd has a corner. Several examples are constructed when d = 2 : (i) a mixing T for which T*(n,m) has an identity factor whenever n·m < 0; (ii) a mixing T for which T* is rigid but T*(n,m) <b>is</b> <b>mixing</b> for all (n,m) ¹ (0, 0); (iii) a T mixing on 3 sets for which T* <b>is</b> not <b>mixing</b> on 3 sets...|$|R

5|$|Sodium is now {{produced}} commercially {{through the}} electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, {{based on a}} process patented in 1924. This is done in a Downs cell in which the NaCl <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700°C. As calcium is less electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be deposited at the cathode. This method is less expensive than the previous Castner process (the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} psychosocial {{interventions}} {{may be useful}} in the treatment of schizophrenia including: family therapy, assertive community treatment, supported employment, cognitive remediation, skills training, token economic interventions, and psychosocial interventions for substance use and weight management. Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, may reduce relapses and hospitalizations. Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse is minimal. Evidence for metacognitive training <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> with one 2016 review finding benefit and another not. Art or drama therapy have not been well-researched.|$|E
5|$|A widely {{consumed}} liquor among Palestinian Christians, non-religious Palestinians {{and many}} less-stringently observant Muslims is Arak. Arak {{is a clear}} anise-flavored alcoholic drink that <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> with water to soften it {{and give it a}} creamy white color. It is consumed during special occasions such as holidays, weddings, and gatherings or with the mezze. Beer is also a consumed drink and the Palestinian town of Taybeh in the central West Bank contains one of the few breweries in Palestine. In addition to regular beer, the brewery produces non-alcoholic beer for observant Muslims. The nearby town of Birzeit is also home to Shepherds Brewery.|$|E
5000|$|A basic {{optional}} feature for larger grinders is the mixer unit. With this unit can <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> {{different kinds of}} meat (for example beef or pork) with each other homogeneously and/or can <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> the meat with additives, like salt or spices, before grinding it.Without such a mixer unit, the additives must <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> into the meat after grinding it, which adversely affects the taste and appearance of most products.|$|R

It {{agrees with the}} Nestle-Aland text 66 times (Gospels), 38 (Acts), 104 (Paul), and 41 (Cath.). It has 50 {{independent}} or distinctive readings in the Gospels, 11 in Acts, 17 in Paul, and 14 in the Catholic epistles. Aland placed {{the text of the}} codex in Category II. According to the Claremont Profile Method its text <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> in Luke 1, Luke 10, and Luke 20.|$|E
5|$|Body {{piercing}} jewellery should be hypoallergenic. A number of materials are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical stainless steel, niobium and titanium {{are commonly used}} metals, with titanium {{the least likely to}} cause allergic reaction of the three. Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, as gold <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> with other metals, and sterling silver is not a good alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings of any age. An additional risk for allergic reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is made from a different metal than the primary piece.|$|E
5|$|Joehana {{appears to}} have been {{familiar}} with the traditional literatures of Maritime Southeast Asia, drawing on the Ramayana for Nangis Wibisana. Wayang characters such as the clown Cepot are referred to in his writings, and he draws on traditional Sundanese storytelling techniques, such as the pantun form of poetry common in wayang golek performances. However, there are significant shifts. His writings depart from the traditional forms of literature such as wawacan, instead embracing the novel, a European literary form. Unlike the formal language used in traditional literature, Joehana wrote in everyday Sundanese. The grammar and structure shows evidence of influence from other languages, and the vocabulary is likewise not purely Sundanese; some Dutch (the language of the colonial government) <b>is</b> <b>mixed</b> in.|$|E
