5|$|The Germans, too, had {{suffered}} heavy casualties; the 116th Panzer Division, for example, {{had lost its}} offensive capabilities after countless attempts to break the U.S. First Army's encirclement of Aachen. This gave American and British commanders {{a false sense of}} security, believing that the Wehrmacht did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> launch a counteroffensive. Given their view {{on the state of the}} German armed forces and their need to push to the Rur, the First Army decided to drive German forces out of the Hürtgen Forest—located on the Belgian–German border—in an attempt to take a series of dams which could be used by the Germans to flood the valley below.|$|E
5|$|By December 1966 some Australian officers, {{including}} Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, the 5 RAR commanding officer, {{had begun}} to reassess their operational aims. Warr argued that they should move away from conventional operations and instead focus on population control and disrupting communist supply lines and freedom of movement. Assessing that with just two infantry battalions 1 ATF did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> destroy the Viet Cong forces then in Phuoc Tuy, Warr favoured cordon and search operations to eliminate cadres and block the supply of rice from the villages. On 7 January 1967, Brigadier David Jackson was replaced as Commander 1 ATF by Brigadier Stuart Graham, and he subsequently approved Warr's proposed concept of operations. Two days later 5 RAR conducted a successful cordon and search of the village of Binh Ba as part of Operation Caloundra, screening 1,500 villagers and interrogating 591. Nine confirmed members of the Viet Cong were captured, while five draft dodgers were also detained. By mid-afternoon the operation had concluded without a shot being fired.|$|E
5|$|Dominant bulls follow {{groups of}} cows during the rut, from August into early winter. A bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from {{competing}} bulls and predators. Only mature bulls have large harems and breeding success peaks at {{about eight years}} of age. Bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and {{spend most of the}} rut on the periphery of larger harems. Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime. A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight. Bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period or <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> survive the rigors of the oncoming winter.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} in a {{different}} place for each playable character. With the exception of Carlie, the main character is soon told (or otherwise decides) to seek the advice of the Priest of Light in the Holy City Wendel. They arrive at the city of Jadd soon after the Beastmen have invaded. Due to the Beastmen's werewolf powers, they are able to make an escape by night. The main character—now including Carlie—on the way to Wendel stays overnight in Astoria where they are woken by a bright light. Following it, it reveals itself to be a Faerie from the Mana Sanctuary, exhausted by her journey. Out of desperation, the Faerie chooses the main character to be her host, and tells them to get to Wendel. There, while they explain their grievances to the Priest of Light, the Faerie interrupts and explains that the Mana Tree is dying and that the Sanctuary is in danger. The Priest explains that if the Tree dies, the God Beasts will reawaken and destroy the world. He goes on to explain further that, because the Faerie has chosen the main character as its host, they must travel to the Sanctuary to draw the Sword of Mana from the foot of the Mana Tree. They can then restore peace to the world, and have their wishes granted by the Mana Goddess if the sword is drawn before the Tree dies. A great deal of power is needed to open the gate to the Sanctuary. The Faerie does not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> do it, and the ancient spell which would do so by unlocking the power in the Mana Stones also takes the caster's life. The Stones' guarding elemental spirits, however, will to be able to open the gate if their powers are combined.|$|E

25|$|Eridanus is {{connected}} to the myth of Phaethon, who took over the reins of his father Helios' sky chariot (i.e., the Sun), but didn't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> control it and so veered wildly in different directions, scorching both Earth and heaven. Zeus intervened by striking Phaethon dead with a thunderbolt and casting him to Earth. The constellation {{was supposed to be the}} path Phaethon drove along; in later times, it was considered a path of souls. Since Eridanos was also a Greek name for the Po (Latin Padus), in which the burning body of Phaethon is said by Ovid to have extinguished, the mythic geography of the celestial and earthly Eridanus is complex.|$|E

25|$|As the North Vietnamese 4th Army Corps was {{the first}} army to arrive on the {{battlefield}} at Xuan Loc, the Central Military Committee decided that the 4th Army Corps would lead the assault. The 4th Army Corps at Xuan Loc fielded three combat divisions (6th, 7th and 341st Infantry Divisions). Those divisions had support from the 71st Anti-Aircraft Regiment, two combat engineering regiments (24th and 25th Engineering Regiments), the 26th Communications Regiment, two armoured battalions, two artillery battalions, and two Long Khánh provincial infantry battalions. On April 3, 1975, the 4th Army Corps Command came up with two options for attack; the first option would involve capturing all enemy outposts in the surrounding areas, and isolating the town centre in the process. If the opportunity arose, the 4th Army Corps would launch a full frontal assault on the town centre to capture all of Xuan Loc. In the second option, if enemy forces in Xuan Loc did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> resist, the 4th Army Corps would strike directly at the town centre using infantry units, with armoured and artillery units in support.|$|E
25|$|Some have {{suggested}} that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman, since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.|$|E
500|$|The {{incineration}} of Sava's relics {{provoked the}} Serbs, and empowered the Serb liberation movement. From 1596, {{the center of}} anti-Ottoman activity in Herzegovina was the Tvrdoš Monastery in Trebinje, where Metropolitan Visarion was seated. Many of the Orthodox bishops appealed to the Archduchy of Austria for help in liberating their lands. The Uskoks, irregular soldiers in Habsburg Croatia, supported Austria, being scattered over the whole area between Senj and Ragusa (modern day Dubrovnik). With a daring raid on April 8, 1596, the Uskoks even managed to occupy the Klis Fortress, though {{they were unable to}} hold it. At one point, Austrian officials considered taking military action in Bosnia, where Dalmatian-born Maltese knight Franjo Brtučević was in their service. However, they did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> fight the Ottomans in Bosnia. Earlier, Austrian forces had gone to great lengths and still barely managed to resist the Ottomans in Hungary.|$|E

500|$|In 1940, Massaquoi {{finished}} {{writing an}} autobiographical {{account of her}} early life as a tribal child, her life experiences with Europeans and education in Germany and Switzerland, and impressions of America. Watkins told her the English was too poor for publication, but later he claimed in a 1944 letter that she had written the account upon his insistence. While awaiting the editing, Massaquoi continued helping the school prepare a dictionary on the Vai language, teaching cultural dance and language, but was unhappy with the arrangement which paid only a small sum. When she attempted to retrieve her manuscript, Watkins refused and she sued the university for its return and to bar them from publishing her works. In 1945, she won a permanent injunction against Watkins, Dr. Thomas E. Jones, president of the university, and Fisk University prohibiting them from publishing or receiving any financial rewards from any publication of the work. Massaquoi felt {{that she had been}} [...] "conspired against" [...] because she was foreign and a presumption that she did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> fight for her rights.|$|E
500|$|On 19 December, Manstein {{sent his}} chief {{intelligence}} officer—Major Eismann—into Stalingrad to give General Paulus an accurate {{image of the}} strategic situation which had befallen Army Group Don. Paulus was not impressed, although he agreed that the best option continued to be an attempted breakout as early as possible. The 6th Army's Chief of Staff—Major General Arthur Schmidt—argued that a breakout was unfeasible and instead suggested that Army Group Don take steps to better supply entrapped Axis forces by air. Despite agreeing with Eismann earlier, Paulus then decided that a breakout {{was out of the}} question given the 6th Army's incapability to conduct it and Hitler's express orders against it. Although that day the LVII Panzer Corps managed to breakthrough the Alksay River and drive within [...] of the southern edge of the 6th Army's front, the entrapped German forces made no attempt to link up with the relieving forces. [...] Adam makes the point the 6th Army tanks only had fuel to go 30 km, after which they would need fuel and ammunition flown in to go any further. [...] Thereafter, the 6th Army simply did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> attempt a breakout, operating less than 70 serviceable tanks, with limited supplies, while its infantry were in no condition to attempt an attack in the blizzard which had developed over the past few days.|$|E
500|$|Upon its {{publication}} in English in early 2009, The Kindly Ones received mixed reviews. The New Republics literary critic Ruth Franklin called it [...] "one {{of the most}} repugnant books I have ever read [...] if getting under {{the skin of a}} murderer were sufficient to produce a masterpiece, then Thomas Harris would be Tolstoy." [...] Michiko Kakutani, the principal book critic of The New York Times, called the novel [...] "illfully sensationalistic and deliberately repellent" [...] and went on to question the [...] "perversity" [...] of the French literary establishment for praising the novel. In a reply to Kakutani, writer and novelist Michael Korda wrote, [...] "You want to read about Hell, here it is. If you don’t <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> read it, tough shit. It’s a dreadful, compelling, brilliantly researched, and imagined masterpiece, a terrifying literary achievement, and perhaps the first work of fiction {{to come out of the}} Holocaust that places us in its very heart, and keeps us there." [...] Writing for Time, American writer and journalist Lev Grossman compared it to Roberto Bolaño's 2666, similar in [...] "their seriousness of purpose, their wild overestimation of the reader's attention span and their interest in physical violence that makes Saw look like Dora the Explorer," [...] but added that while far from perfect, The Kindly Ones [...] "is unmistakably the work of a profoundly gifted writer, if not an especially disciplined one." [...] In her review for Los Angeles Times, novelist and essayist Laila Lalami wrote: [...] "Jonathan Littell has undertaken a very ambitious project in The Kindly Ones, and I think his boldness deserves to be commended. In the end, however, his highly problematic characterization and awkward handling of point of view make this book far more successful as a dramatized historical document than as a novel." [...] British historian Antony Beevor, author of Stalingrad and The Fall of Berlin 1945, reviewing The Kindly Ones in The Times, called it [...] "a great work of literary fiction, to which readers and scholars will turn for decades to come," [...] and listed it as one of the top five books of World War II fiction.|$|E
