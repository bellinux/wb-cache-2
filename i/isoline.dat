There have been two complete sets of Véronique– a 1953 Decca mono recording conducted by Pierre Dervaux, and a 1969 stereo EMI recording conducted by Jean-Claude Hartemann. Other complete sets of Messager operas include L'amour masqué (1970; conductor, Raymond Legrand), La Basoche (1960; Tony Aubin), Coups de roulis (1963; Marcel Cariven), Fortunio (1987; John Eliot Gardiner), <b>Isoline</b> (1947; Louis Beydts), Monsieur Beaucaire (1958; Jules Gressier), and Passionnément (1964; Jean-Paul Kreder).|$|E
500|$|In 1886 Les deux pigeons {{was finally}} {{produced}} at the Paris Opéra {{and was a}} great success. [...] It was Messager's last success for four years. [...] His attempt at a more serious opera, Le bourgeois de Calais (1888), with [...] "a boring historical plot, bad lyrics, and a banal score" [...] was not well received. One critic wrote, [...] "That Le Bourgeois de Calais will have a successful career {{there is not the}} faintest chance, for all the patriotic bolstering in the world could not make it an attractive piece." [...] Messager followed this with a musical fairy tale <b>Isoline</b> (1888), which was slightly better received, and a three-act operetta, Le mari de la reine (The Queen's Husband, 1889), which failed, although Messager thought it [...] "the best of my flops." [...] Also in the 1880s, Messager published some song cycles, and [...] "sung waltzes".|$|E

40|$|Concentrations of cadmium in {{the grain}} of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var durum) are often above the internationally {{acceptable}} limit of 0. 2 mg kg− 1. Cultivars that vary in concentrations of cadmium in the grain have been identified but the physiology behind differential accumulation has not been determined. Three pairs of near-isogenic lines (<b>isolines)</b> of durum wheat that vary in aboveground cadmium accumulation (8982 -TL ‘high’ and ‘low’, W 9260 -BC ‘high’ and ‘low’, and W 9261 -BG ‘high’ and ‘low’) were {{used to test the}} hypothesis that the greater amounts of cadmium in shoots of the ‘high’ <b>isolines</b> are correlated with greater volumes of water transpired. In general, cadmium content was positively correlated with transpiration only in the ‘low’ <b>isolines.</b> Although shoots of the ‘high’ <b>isolines</b> of W 9260 -BC and W 9261 -BG contained higher concentrations of cadmium than did their corresponding ‘low’ <b>isolines,</b> they did not transpire larger volumes of water. In addition, <b>isolines</b> of 8982 -TL transpired less water than did the other pairs of <b>isolines</b> yet both ‘high’ and ‘low’ <b>isolines</b> of 8982 -TL contained higher amounts of cadmium than did the other pairs. The difference between ‘high’ and ‘low’ <b>isolines</b> appears {{to be related to the}} relative contribution of transpiration to cadmium translocation to the shoot. Increased transpiration was associated with increased cadmium content in the ‘low’ <b>isolines</b> but in the ‘high’ <b>isolines</b> increased cadmium in the shoot occurred independently of the volume of water transpired...|$|R

40|$|Iso-female lines (<b>isolines)</b> of Anopheles aconitus {{collected}} from Mae Hong Son, Phet Buri, and Chiang Mai Provinces were successfully identified to karyotypic forms. The results of identification revealed that An. aconitus Form B (X- 1, X- 2, Y- 2) {{was obtained from}} four and 48 <b>isolines</b> in Phet Buri and Chiang Mai Provinces, respectively, and Form C (X- 1 X- 2 Y- 3) was recovered from three and 41 <b>isolines</b> in Mae Hong Son and Chiang Mai Provinces, respectively. When comparing band to band on the same arm of ovarian nurse cell polytene chromosomes of An. aconitus Form B (Phet Buri: four <b>isolines)</b> and C (Mae Hong Son: three <b>isolines,</b> Chiang Mai: 20 <b>isolines)</b> to the standard chromosome mapping of An. aconitus Form B (Chiang Mai: 20 <b>isolines),</b> no major chromosomal rearrangements that related to the karyotype variations were demonstrated. The investigations on allelic frequencies of 4 th stage larvae and adult females of three (Form C: Mae Hong Son), four (Form B: Phet Buri), 41 (Form C: Chiang Mai) and 48 (Form B: Chiang Mai) <b>isolines</b> suggested that An. aconitus Form B and C of all strains have similar allelic frequencies. This was observed at 10 isoenzymes 16 loci in 4 th stage larvae, and 11 isoenzymes 13 loci in adult females. Hybridization tests among the four laboratory-raised <b>isolines</b> of An. aconitus Form B (Chiang Mai and Phet Buri) and C (Chiang Mai and Mae Hong Son) were employed by induced copulation. The results of crosses {{indicated that they were}} genetically compatible, providing viable progeny and completely synaptic salivary gland polytene chromosomes. The complete sequences of rDNA internal-transcribed spacer two (ITS 2) and partial sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and II (COI and COII) from genomic DNA of 12 <b>isolines</b> of An. aconitus Form B and C were identified. Total sequence lengths (ITS 2 +COI+COII) of An. aconitus <b>isolines</b> varied from 1550 bp to 1556 bp. Conspecific relationships between the twoAn. aconitus forms were well supported by low values of intraspecific distances (ranged from 0. 1 % to 1. 0 %) and genetic differentiation (d(xy) : 0. 0 1322) between the two forms. Based on evidence of no pre- and post-mating isolations, and nearly identical of DNA sequences of ITS 2, COI and COII regions between An. aconitus Form B and C, we conclude that they are conspecific cytological races in the Thai population...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of plant}} height on Fusarium crown rot (FCR) disease {{severity}} were investigated using 12 pairs of near-isogenic lines (NILs) for six different reduced height (Rht) genes in wheat. The dwarf <b>isolines</b> all gave better FCR resistance {{when compared with}} their respective tall counterparts, although the Rht genes involved in these NILs are located on several different chromosomes. Treating plants with exogenous gibberellin increased FCR severity as well as seedling lengths {{in all of the}} <b>isolines</b> tested. Analysis of the expression of several defense genes with known correlation with resistance to FCR pathogens between the Rht <b>isolines</b> following FCR inoculation indicated that the better resistance of the dwarf <b>isolines</b> was not due to enhanced defense gene induction. These results suggested that the difference in FCR severity between the tall and dwarf <b>isolines</b> is likely due to their height difference per se or to some physiological and structural consequences of reduced height. Thus, caution should be taken when considering to exploit any FCR locus located near a height gene. © 2010 The American Phytopathological Society...|$|R

The resistant Betta <b>isolines</b> (i. e., Betta-Dn 1 and Betta-Dn 2) supported similar numbers of aphids, but had significantly {{fewer than the}} susceptible Betta wheat, indicating these lines are resistant to aphid feeding.

However, knowledge on whether the northward displacement of vegetation productivity <b>isolines</b> matches that of temperature <b>isolines</b> is still limited. Here we compared changes in the spatial patterns of vegetation productivity and temperature using the velocity of change concept, which expresses these two variables in the same unit of displacement per time. We show that across northern regions (> 50 ° N), the average velocity of change in growing-season normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIGS, an indicator of vegetation productivity; 2. 8 [*]±[*] 1. 1 [*]km[*]yr⁻¹) is lower than that of growing-season mean temperature (TGS; 5. 4 [*]±[*] 1. 0 [*]km[*]yr⁻¹). In fact, the NDVIGS velocity was {{less than half of the}} TGS velocity in more than half of the study area, indicating that the northward movement of productivity <b>isolines</b> is much slower than that of temperature <b>isolines</b> across the majority of northern regions (about 80 % of the area showed faster changes in temperature than productivity <b>isolines).</b> We tentatively attribute this mismatch between the velocities of productivity and temperature to the effects of limited resource availability and vegetation acclimation mechanisms. Analyses of ecosystem model simulations further suggested that limited nitrogen availability is a crucial obstacle for vegetation to track the warming trend...|$|R

The differences between tall and dwarf <b>isolines</b> for number of total and effective tillers plant − 1, leaf sheath length, and time to 50 % anthesis were either nonsignificant or inconsistent across locations.
