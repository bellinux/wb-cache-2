Analogue video signals contain a frequency content from 25 Hz up to around 5 MHz, and so variations in frequency responses will affect the picture in various ways, depending on whether it is high frequency (>1 MHz) or low frequency (<1 MHz) distortion. Low <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> will cause field-rate impairment, manifesting itself as luminance variation between {{the top and bottom}} of a picture.

50|$|The hot film MAF sensor works {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} hot wire MAF sensor, but instead it usually outputs a frequency signal. This sensor uses a hot film-grid instead of a hot wire. It is commonly found in late 80’s early 90’s fuel-injected vehicles. The output frequency is directly proportional to the air mass entering the engine. So as mass flow increases so does frequency. These sensors tend to cause intermittent problems due to internal electrical failures. The use of an oscilloscope is strongly recommended to check the output frequency of these sensors. <b>Frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> is also common when the sensor starts to fail. Many technicians in the field use a tap test with very conclusive results. Not all HFM systems output a frequency. In some cases, this sensor works by outputting a regular varying voltage signal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We model a {{degraded}} {{image as}} an original image {{that has been}} subject to linear <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> and additive noise injection. Since the psychovisual effects of <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> and noise injection are independent, we decouple these two sources of degradation and measure their effect on the human visual system. We develop a distortion measure (DM) {{of the effect of}} <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion,</b> and a noise quality measure (NQM) of the effect of additive noise. The NQM, which is based on Peli’s contrast pyramid, takes into account the following: 1) variation in contrast sensitivity with distance, image dimensions, and spatial frequency; 2) variation in the local luminance mean; 3) contrast interaction between spatial frequencies; 4) contrast masking effects. For additive noise, we demonstrate that the nonlinear NQM is a better measure of visual quality than peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and linear quality measures. We compute the DM in three steps. First, we find the <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> in the degraded image. Second, we compute the deviation of this <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> from an allpass response of unity gain (no distortion). Finally, we weight the deviation by a model of the frequency response of the human visual system and integrate over the visible frequencies. We demonstrate how to decouple distortion and additive noise degradation in a practical image restoration system. Index Terms—Computational vision, human visual system modeling, image quality.

After a general description of the operation and control of the cycloconverter, the distortion of the output waveform due to low frequency components is discussed. Under these circumstances, the fundamental repetition frequency of the waveform is less than the wanted output frequency, and two methods of determining it for given input and output frequencies are developed. The characteristics and properties of the low <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> components, and the requirements for attenuating them are analysed. The particular effects on the magnitudes of these components due to operation of the cycloconverter in the inhibited mode, rather than the circulating-current mode, are examined and the requirements for attenuating them are identified. It is shown that the communications engineering processes of pulse width modulation and of natural sampling can be identified in the control of the cycloconverter. Regular sampling is more widely used in communications engineering, and its effect on the low <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> components in the cycloconverter output is compared with natural sampling. A modified control method for the inhibited cycloconverter is then developed to attenuate these components. Digital computer programs were written to test the effect of introducing modifications to the control of the cycloconverter, and the more significant results are given in graphical and tabulated form. An experimental cycloconverter, with an inhibition control circuit designed for this project, was constructed to check the validity of the computer programs.
