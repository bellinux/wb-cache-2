500|$|Borussia {{were drawn}} against Slovan Liberec of the Czech Republic in the quarter–finals, {{the first leg}} was drawn 0–0 draw in Prague. The draw was {{significant}} {{because it was the}} first time in the competition, that Liberec had failed to win at home. Dortmund won the second leg 4–0, after goals from Márcio Amoroso on 51 minutes, Jan Koller on 57 minutes, Lars Ricken on 70 minutes, and finally Ewerthon on 89 minutes. Borussia faced stronger opponents in the semi-finals, when they were drawn with the then five times champions of Europe; Milan. Nevertheless, Borussia won the first leg 4–0, after a hat-trick from Márcio Amoroso, and a goal on 63 minutes from Jörg Heinrich. Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti admitted he was not surprised with the result, stating that, [...] "We knew they had quick strikers. I am more surprised by the terrible performance of our team. The problem stemmed from the wings. I had no reason to change the team because Rui Costa has not trained for ten days. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> but it is our duty to give it our best and to try and qualify." [...] In the second leg, Milan won 3–1, with Filippo Inzaghi, and Cosmin Contra scoring within 18 minutes. However, Milan did not get their third goal until injury time when Serginho scored a penalty after Inzaghi was adjudged to have been pulled back by Christoph Metzelder. With Milan still needing one goal to force extra time, Lars Ricken scored for Dortmund in the fourth minute of injury time to put the club into their first European final since winning the 1997 Champions League Final.|$|E

2500|$|The Cycle Super Highways are {{a series}} of bike paths that connect Copenhagen to nearby suburbs. This {{initiative}} began in 2009 when both Copenhagen and the neighboring cities realized that building new infrastructure would allow commuters to bike into the city and create more sustainable transportation options. Since traffic planners believe <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to raise the modal share substantially beyond the current 50% for its own residents, the city has begun targeting commuters entering the city from surrounding municipalities on trips in the [...] range, aiming {{to increase the number of}} bicycle commuters by 30% throughout the capital region. The project involves a [...] network of 26 named and signposted routes following a uniform standard with high maintenance and good services such as automatic air-pumps and prioritized snow removal. While international media has created some hyperbole around the concept, labelling the network as bicycle superhighways, they are largely not grade separated. Rather the routes are regular cycle tracks receiving smaller targeted upgrades.|$|E

2500|$|Benazir Bhutto was prime {{minister}} {{at a time}} of great racial tension in Pakistan. Her approval poll rose by 38% after she appeared and said in a private television interview after the elections: [...] "We are unhappy with the manner in which tampered electoral lists were provided in a majority of constituencies; our voters were turned away." [...] The Conservatives attracted voters from religious society (MMA) whose support had collapsed. The Friday Times noted [...] "Both of them (Nawaz and Benazir) have done so badly in the past, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> for them to do worse now. If Bhutto's government fails, everyone knows there will be no new elections. The army will take over". In confidential official documents Benazir Bhutto had objected to the number of Urdu speaking class in 1993 elections, in context that she had no Urdu-speaking sentiment in her circle and discrimination was continued even in her government. Her stance on these issues was perceived as part of rising public disclosure which Altaf Hussain called [...] "racism". Due to Benazir Bhutto's stubbornness and authoritative actions, her political rivals gave her the nickname [...] "Iron Lady" [...] of Pakistan. No response was issued by Bhutto, but she soon associated with the term.|$|E

He asked Kong Rong to let him lead soldiers to fight their way out, but Kong refused and insisted on waiting for reinforcements. The rebels came closer day by day. Kong Rong wanted to seek help from Liu Bei, the Chancellor of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Pingyuan, Shandong), {{but no one had}} any idea on how {{to break out of the}} siege. Taishi Ci volunteered to fight his way out and seek reinforcements from Liu Bei, but Kong Rong said, [...] "The rebels have completely surrounded the fortress. Everyone thinks it is impossible to break out. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> for you to break out no matter how courageous you are." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "When I was away, you treated my mother very generously. She feels grateful, hence she told me to help you. She knew that I know what I am doing, and that I can help you. Now, everyone says it is impossible to break out. If I were to agree with them, I will not be able to repay your kindness. Why, then, did my mother send me here for? We are in a very desperate situation. I hope you won't hesitate any longer." [...] Kong Rong agreed to let him break out of the siege.|$|E
