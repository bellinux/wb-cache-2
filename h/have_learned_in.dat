500|$|In late March, viewers started {{noticing that}} Jennings' voice sounded uncharacteristically gravelly and {{unhealthy}} during evening newscasts. On April 1, 2005, he anchored World News Tonight {{for the last}} time; his failing health also prevented him from covering the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II. On April 5, 2005, Jennings informed viewers through a taped message on World News Tonight {{that he had been}} diagnosed with lung cancer, and was starting chemotherapy treatment the following week. [...] "As some of you now know, I <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> {{the last couple of days}} that I have lung cancer," [...] he said. [...] "Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weak and I smoked over 9/11. But whatever the reason, the news does slow you down a bit." [...] Although he stated his intention to continue anchoring whenever possible, the message was to be his last appearance on television.|$|E
500|$|According to Rod Roddewig, a {{contemporary}} of Wilt's, Chamberlain documented his love life using a Day-Timer. Every time Chamberlain {{went to bed}} with a different woman, he put a check in his Day-Timer. Over a 10-day period, there were 23 checks in the book, {{which would be a}} rate of 2.3 women per day. Chamberlain divided that number in half, to be conservative and to correct for degrees of variation. He then multiplied that number by the number of days he had been alive at the time minus 15 years. That was how the 20,000 number came into existence. In response to public backlash regarding his promiscuity, Chamberlain later emphasized that [...] "the point of using the number was to show that sex was a great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life. That's the reason why I was single." [...] In a 1999 interview shortly before his death, Chamberlain regretted not having explained the sexual climate {{at the time of his}} escapades, and warned other men who admired him for it, closing with the words: [...] "With all of you men out there who think that having a thousand different ladies is pretty cool, I <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> my life I've found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much more satisfying." [...] Chamberlain also acknowledged that he never came close to marrying and had no intention of raising any children. However, in 2015 a man named Aaron Levi came forward claiming to be Chamberlain's son based on non-identifying papers from his adoption and information from his biological mother. Chamberlain's sister refused to provide DNA evidence for testing, so Levi's claim is not conclusive.|$|E

By late April 1945, the course {{continued to}} take place in Krün, a municipality in Southern Bavaria, adjacent to Tyrol. When Hitler's suicide became known on 30 April, the course came to an end. Before relieving the officers of their duties, Larisch assembled them in the local schoolhouse.

2500|$|T-72M1 (Ob'yekt 172M-E5): this export {{version of}} the T-72A was also built under licence in Poland since 1983. The most obvious {{external}} difference relative to Soviet analogs is the reduced number of KMT mounting points on the lower hull glacis plate. This is the 1st version to feature ceramic sand bars [...] "kwartz" [...] rods in the turret cavity and [...] High Hardness Steel appliqué armor on upper glacis. The reason for introduction of T-72M1 with improved glacis and ceramic turret armor so soon after T-72M was put into production {{was the fact that}} the Soviets <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> 1982 from the captured Israeli tank, that under certain condition the newest M111 [...] "Hetz" [...] 105mm APFSDS Ammunition could penetrate Soviet standard T-72A upper glacis armor but not the turret.|$|E

If {{we could afford}} to give him really good lessons, he would soon be quite a little artist." [...] At the age of thirteen, he received some watercolor lessons from Carl Welsch, a German landscape painter. Although his education was far from complete, Sargent {{grew up to be}} a highly literate and cosmopolitan young man, accomplished in art, music, and literature. He was fluent in French, Italian, and German. At seventeen, Sargent was described as [...] "willful, curious, determined and strong" [...] (after his mother) yet shy, generous, and modest (after his father). He was well-acquainted with many of the great masters from first hand observation, as he wrote in 1874, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> Venice to admire Tintoretto immensely and to consider him perhaps second only to Michelangelo and Titian." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unlike his contemporaries, Compère {{seems to}} have written few masses (at least very few survive). By {{temperament}} he {{seems to have}} been a miniaturist, and his most popular and numerous works were in the shorter forms of the day—primarily chansons and motets. Two stylistic trends are evident in his music: [...] the style of the Burgundian School, which he seems to <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> his early career before coming to Italy, and the lighter style of the Italian composers current at the time, who were writing frottolas (the light and popular predecessor to the madrigal). Compère had a gift for melody, and many of his chansons became popular; later composers used several as cantus firmi for masses. Occasionally {{he seems to have}} given himself a formidable technical challenge and set out to solve it, such as writing quodlibets (an example is Au travail suis, which combines no less than six different tunes written to the same text by different composers).|$|E

[...] O'Donnell responded to the cancellation by thanking her viewers and the host city of Chicago: [...] "I loved working with Oprah in the amazing city of Chicago. I was welcomed with open arms and will never forget the kindness of all I encountered. It was a great year for me—I wish the show was able to attract more viewers—but it did not.
