40|$|Abstract. The {{recognition}} of surface damage on rails is {{of critical importance}} in order to guarantee {{a high level of}} safety for normal train operation. Without early recognition systems, defect damage (e. g. cracks) in the rail, will increase in size and can eventually lead to fracture of the rail. Special grinding trains are in general use for rail maintenance and are employed to machine down worn rails and prevent surface damage in an early stadium. The company SPENO INTERNATIONAL SA along with the BAM, DB AG and other partners have integrated an eddy current instrument into a <b>grinding</b> train. The <b>equipment</b> has been developed for detection of Head Check type defects and provides information on defect position and depth. Initial experiments were presented at the DACH-conference 2004 in Salzburg [1]. This system has been continually developed and as will be shown is ready for practical application.

40|$|In this dissertation, I study a {{critical}} transition {{in the urban}} development of Tell es-Sweyhat, a large site in Syria occupied from c. 3000 - 1900 BCE. In {{the middle of the}} third millennium, Sweyhat was an open town centered on a fortress. It was ringed with cemeteries and had a ceremonial public building in its outskirts (Sweyhat Period 3). Around 2150 BCE, the settlement experienced a sudden expansion from 15 HA to 35 - 40 HA. Sweyhat became a fortified city with a high central ceremonial platform and no formal cemetery (Sweyhat Period 4). The new fortifications combined with increased population density signifies Sweyhat's transition from a town to a regional urban center. In this dissertation, I identify the changes in land use during this transition and examine the accompanying social changes. I focus on several domestic structures excavated {{along the edge of the}} Sweyhat 4 Inner City wall, along with the associated artifact inventories, including spinning and weaving <b>equipment,</b> <b>grinding</b> and cooking <b>equipment,</b> and whole ceramic vessels. One adult burial and several infant burials were also uncovered here. Additional soundings reached down into the Sweyhat 3 layers of this neighborhood. I synthesize the data from these excavations alongside architectural remains and artifact assemblages from other excavated areas of the site, to create a narrative of the changes in the site's occupational history and the possible meanings inherent in those changes. The results reveal that the character and location of certain daily and special activities changed, including mourning the dead, grain storage, grinding and cooking activities, and ceremonial activities. The outer town cemeteries were abandoned, possibly in favor of individual household burials. Grain storage, grinding, and cooking activities that had been located in the central storage area moved to the home. The locus of ceremonial activities shifted from the public building in the outer town to a new structure located in the city center. Access to this new structure was limited: it sat atop a high terrace that was accessible only by particular ramps or stairways, in a district at the center of the city's two fortifications. These shifts suggest increased control of formerly accessible public activities and greater attention to individual privacy. These changes were an integral part of Tell es-Sweyhat's transition from open town to walled city...|$|R
5000|$|Early {{hydraulic}} cements, such {{as those}} of James Parker, James Frost and Joseph Aspdin were relatively soft and readily ground by the primitive technology of the day, using flat millstones. The emergence of Portland cement in the 1840s made grinding considerably more difficult, because the clinker produced by the kiln is often as hard as the millstone material. Because of this, cement continued to be ground very coarsely (typically 20% over 100 μm particle diameter) until better grinding technology became available. Besides producing un-reactive cement with slow strength growth, this exacerbated the problem of unsoundness. This late, disruptive expansion is caused by hydration of large particles of calcium oxide. Fine grinding lessens this effect, and early cements had to be stored for several months to give the calcium oxide time to hydrate before it was fit for sale. From 1885 onward, the development of specialized steel {{led to the development of}} new forms of <b>grinding</b> <b>equipment,</b> and from this point onward, the typical fineness of cement began a steady rise. The progressive reduction in the proportion of larger, un-reactive cement particles has been partially responsible for the fourfold increase in the strength of Portland cement during the twentieth century. [...] The recent history of the technology has been mainly concerned with reducing the energy consumption of the grinding process.|$|E
50|$|The {{characteristic}} greenish-gray {{to brown}} color of ordinary Portland cement derives {{from a number}} of transition elements in its chemical composition. These are, in decreasing order of coloring effect, chromium, manganese, iron, copper, vanadium, nickel and titanium. The amount of these in white cement is minimized as far as possible. Cr2O3 is kept below 0.003%, Mn2O3 is kept below 0.03%, and Fe2O3 is kept below 0.35% in the clinker. The other elements are usually not a significant problem. Portland cement is usually made from cheap, quarried raw materials, and these usually contain substantial amounts of Cr, Mn and Fe. For example, limestones used in cement manufacture usually contain 0.3-1% Fe2O3, whereas levels below 0.1% are sought in limestones for white manufacture. Typical clays used in gray cement rawmix may contain 5-15% Fe2O3. Levels below 0.5% are desirable, and conventional clays are usually replaced with kaolin. Kaolin is fairly low in SiO2, and so a large amount of sand is usually also included in the mix. Iron and manganese usually occur together in nature, so that selection of low-iron materials usually ensures that manganese content is also low, but chromium can arise from other sources, notably from the wear of chrome steel <b>grinding</b> <b>equipment</b> during the production of rawmix. See rawmill. This wear is exacerbated by the high sand-content of the mix, which makes it extremely abrasive. Furthermore, to make a combinable rawmix, the sand must be ground to below 45 μm particle diameter. Often this is achieved by grinding the sand separately, using ceramic grinding media to limit the chromium contamination.|$|E
5000|$|To prevent dust {{explosions and}} fires, {{employers}} must (among other things):Develop {{and implement a}} written housekeeping program with instructions to reduce dust accumulations on ledges, floors, equipment and other exposed surfaces.Identify [...] "priority" [...] housekeeping areas in grain elevators. The [...] "priority" [...] housekeeping areas include floor areas within 35 feet of inside bucket elevators, floors of enclosed areas containing <b>grinding</b> <b>equipment</b> and floors of enclosed areas containing grain dryers located inside the facility. Dust accumulations in these priority housekeeping areas shall not exceed 1/8th inch. Employers should {{make every effort to}} minimize dust accumulations on exposed surfaces since dust is the fuel for a fire or explosion, and it is recognized that a 1/8 inch dust accumulation is more than enough to fuel such occurrences.Inside bucket elevators can undergo primary explosions. OSHA's grain handling standard requires that belts for these bucket elevators purchased after March 30, 1988 are conductive and have a surface electrical resistance not exceeding 300 megohms. Bucket elevators must have an opening to the head pulley section and boot section to allow for inspection, maintenance, and cleaning. Bearings must be mounted externally to the leg casing or the employer must provide vibration, temperature, or other monitoring of the conditions of the bearings if the bearings are mounted inside or partially inside the leg casing. These bucket elevators must be equipped with a motion detection device which will shut-down the elevator when the belt speed is reduced by no more than 20% of the normal operating speed.Implement a preventative maintenance program with regularly scheduled inspections for mechanical and safety control equipment, which may include heat producing equipment such as motors, bearings, belts etc. Preventive maintenance is critical to controlling ignition sources. The use of vibration detection methods, heat sensitive tape or other heat detection methods can help in the implementation of the program.Minimize ignition sources through controlling hot work (electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar flame producing operations).Install wiring and electrical equipment suitable for hazardous locations.Design and properly locate dust collection systems to minimize explosion hazards. All filter collectors installed after March 1988 shall be located outside the facility or located in an area inside the facility protected by an explosion suppression system or located in an area that is separated from other areas by construction having at least a one-hour fire resistance rating and which is located next to an exterior wall vented to the outside.Install an effective means of removing ferrous material from grain streams so that such material does not enter equipment such as hammer mills, grinders and pulverizers.|$|E
50|$|Foston Beck {{provided}} {{a source of}} water for milling for centuries. A mill {{is known to have}} been in operation in 1086, and the mill pond may possibly have been created by diverting Kelk Beck during the period of Danish settlement. Kelk Beck now becomes Foston Beck near the village. A new mill was built on the site in 1747. The open fields around Foston were enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1780, and special provision was made for the miller. This allowed him to divert the beck into a drainage ditch to allow him to carry out repairs to the mill or to scour the beck. Sir William St Quintin, 5th Baronet, the son of Sir William St Quintin, 4th Baronet, bought the mill in 1792, and spent some £1,500 {{over the next four years}} on repairs and improvements. By the time he had finished, two water wheels drove four pairs of <b>grinding</b> stones. <b>Equipment</b> also included two flour cylinders, four bolting mills, two corn-screens, a fan and a corn-drying kiln. Access to the mill was possible by boat along Foston Beck from the Driffield Navigation. Water power was supplemented by a steam engine by 1854, the mill being one of only eleven in the county to be modernised in this way. It was also one of only four in the county to be fitted with rollers, which were used to produce fine white flour, of a quality which could not be produced by stones. The water wheels were subsequently replaced by a turbine, but the building burnt down in 1895-6. A new building was erected, and milling was recorded in 1925 and 1929. In 1970, the building was used by the adjacent farm, although it still contained a turbine.|$|R
40|$|National {{electrification}} programmes {{are given}} priority {{in many developing}} countries and the level of electrification is generally seen as one of the key indicators of development. Utilities find rural electrification programmes a challenge because the returns on the investment made in grid extension are minimal given the usually low levels of power consumption in rural areas. An approach, adopted in Zimbabwe that promises to address this problem is to target income-generating activities, mainly the small and medium scale enterprises (SMMEs) in the areas where the electricity grid is extended. This will have the benefits of potentially increasing the return on the utility’s investment by also stimulating small-scale commercial and industrial activities in the areas reached by the grid. It is however important to understand the SMMEs and their needs in order to tailor any support appropriately. When extending the grid to the growth points the Rural Electrification Agency may also provide loans and deliver to site electrical machinery like <b>grinding</b> mills, irrigation <b>equipment</b> and welding machines that entrepreneurs may order. This paper discusses the findings of recent case studies among small enterprise beneficiaries of rural electrification in the arid southwest of Zimbabwe and highlights key lessons learnt...|$|R

The manufactory was finally returned to its original title of 'Royal Manufactory' upon the Bourbon Restoration in 1815. After the Restoration, French officials started considering the fact that the manufactory was too close to the German border for such a strategic asset, and so Weapons production was gradually resettled to Manufacture d'armes de Châtellerault, founded in 1819 in the Western Center of France. In 1838 Klingenthal ended weapons manufacturing, lost the Royal Manufactory status, and became a privately owned company producing civilian goods under the [...] "Couleau" [...] name.
