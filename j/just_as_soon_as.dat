5|$|The massive {{influx of}} prospectors drove the {{formation}} of boom towns along the routes of the stampede, with Dawson City in the Klondike the largest. The new towns were crowded, often chaotic and many disappeared <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> they came. Most stampeders were men but women also travelled to the region, typically as {{the wife of a}} prospector. Some women entertained in gambling and dance halls built by business men and women who were encouraged by the lavish spending of successful miners.|$|E
2500|$|As for the 26th of July 2011, it {{was planned}} to {{interrogate}} 38 witnesses for [...] "the part of prosecution". The judge Kireyev gave admission to witness, for the Tymoshenko part, to just two people (out of 33 claimed) - Alexander Turchinov and Michail Lyvinsky. However even [...] "witnesses {{for the prosecution}} part" [...] were testifying, mainly, in favour of Tymoshenko. As a result, Tymoshenko wrote in her Twitter: [...] "Kireyev was banned to call “our” witnesses, he got rebuked even for “theirs” (i.e. witnesses from prosecution)". On July, the 26th, 2011, i.e. <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the process of witnessing started, direct teletransmitting from the trial room stopped.|$|E

3000|$|... {{take care}} of very {{specific}} assessment things. So they didn’t necessarily have time to integrate or think about what we had done before.

6000|$|... "Oh, I {{will manage}} that," [...] Amuba said lightly. [...] "You know to me a cat is a cat and nothing more, and I would <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> bury one <b>as</b> that rascally hawk {{which has been}} the cause of all this mischief." ...|$|R
50|$|Research {{suggests}} that, {{despite the}} fast mapping hypothesis, words are not <b>just</b> learned <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> we {{are exposed to}} them, each word needs some type of activation and/or acknowledgement before it is permanently and effectively stored. For young children, the word may be accurately stored in their mental lexicon, and they can recognize when an adult produces the incorrect version of the word, {{but they may not}} be able to produce the word accurately.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{she knew}} I was {{coming over to}} Hope <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the roads made it safe and {{pleasant}} for automobiling," [...] he murmured to himself.|$|E

6000|$|... "You don't {{expect me}} to ask her?" [...] giggled Amy MacAllister, the other member of the committee. [...] "Irene and I haven't spoken for a hundred years.

6000|$|... "This {{camping in}} the woods would be quite nice if one could prowl round with the rifle instead of {{pounding}} the drill," [...] he said, and then paused to glance ruefully {{at one of his}} battered hands.

6000|$|... 'No. She loaned {{her sons}} for a pure love-loan, bein' as she sensed the Trouble on the Marshes, an' was simple good-willin' to ease it.' Tom laughed softly. 'She done that. Yes, she done that! From Hithe to Bulverhithe, fretty man an' maid, ailin' woman an' wailin' child, {{they took the}} {{advantage}} of the change in the thin airs <b>just</b> about <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the Pharisees flitted.

6000|$|Naturally, {{under these}} circumstances, {{it was all}} in vain that Guy Waring pursued his {{investigations}} into Montague Nevitt's whereabouts.

[...] And yet Guy felt sure Nevitt wouldn't go far from Mambury, <b>as</b> things stood <b>just</b> then; for <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> he missed the pocket-book containing the three thousand pounds, he would surely take some steps to recover it.|$|R

5000|$|The {{music for}} [...] "Sultans of Swing" [...] was {{composed}} by Mark Knopfler on a National Steel guitar {{in an open}} tuning, though Knopfler did not think very highly of it at first. As he remembered, [...] "I thought it was dull, but <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> I bought my first Strat in 1977, the whole thing changed, though the lyrics remained the same. It <b>just</b> came alive <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> I played it on that ’61 Strat which remained my main guitar {{for many years and}} was basically the only thing I played on the first album and the new chord changes just presented themselves and fell into place." ...|$|R

On the evening of March 10th, I am going to read to the colored folk in the African Church here (no whites admitted except such as I bring with me), and a choir of colored folk will sing jubilee songs. I count on a good time, and shall hope to have you folks there, and Livy. I read in Twichell's chapel Friday night and had a most rattling high time--but the thing that went best of all was Uncle Remus's Tar Baby. I mean to try that on my dusky audience. They've all heard that tale from childhood--at least the older members have.|$|R
