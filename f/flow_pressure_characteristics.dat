The theory of Martin and Padmanabhan takes ac-count of this mechanical coupling between the phases, which in reality is almost complete, as is the case for bubble flow.

40|$|Analytic {{methods for}} {{evaluating}} pointing errors caused by external disturbance torques are developed {{and applied to}} determine the effects of representative values of wind and friction torque. The expressions relating pointing errors to disturbance torques are shown to be strongly dependent upon the state estimator parameters, as well as upon the state feedback gain and the <b>flow</b> versus <b>pressure</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the hydraulic system. Under certain conditions, when control is derived from an uncorrected estimate of integral position error, the desired type 2 servo properties are not realized and finite steady-state position errors result. Methods for reducing these errors to negligible proportions through the proper selection of control gain and estimator correction parameters are demonstrated. The steady-state error produced by a disturbance torque is found to be directly proportional to the hydraulic internal leakage. This property can be exploited to provide a convenient method of determining system leakage from field measurements of estimator error, axis rate, and hydraulic differential pressure...|$|R

40|$|This study uses a 1 D fluid {{dynamics}} arterial network model to predict <b>pressure</b> and <b>flow</b> dynamics in healthy and hypoxic mice. Data {{for this study}} include blood <b>flow</b> and <b>pressure</b> measurements from the main pulmonary artery of 7 healthy and 5 hypoxic mice. Representative arterial network dimensions for the 21 largest pulmonary arterial vessels are extracted from micro-CT images from healthy and hypoxic lungs. Each vessel is represented by its length and radius, and is assumed to taper longitudinally. Fluid dynamic computations are done assuming that the flow is Newtonian, viscous, laminar, has no swirl, and that the arterial walls are thin. The system of equations is closed by a constitutive equation relating pressure and area, using either a linear model derived from stress-strain deformation in the circumferential direction or a nonlinear model of empirical nature. For each dataset, an inflow waveform is extracted from data, and nominal parameters related the outflow boundary conditions were specified using mean values and timescales computed from the measured <b>flow</b> and <b>pressure</b> waveforms. The model was calibrated for each mouse by estimating parameters using optimization that minimized the least squares error between measured and computed <b>pressure</b> and <b>flow</b> waveforms from the main pulmonary artery. Results show that for healthy animals, the nonlinear wall model is needed to predict <b>flow</b> and <b>pressure</b> <b>characteristics,</b> while for the hypoxic animals both models predict the experimental data well, possibly because vessels are significantly stiffer due to wall remodeling.

40|$|Fans can {{be thought}} of as low {{pressure}} air pumps that utilize power from a motor to output a volumetric flow of air at a given pressure. A propeller converts torque from the motor to increase static pressure across the fan rotor and to increase the kinetic energy of the air particles. The motors are typically permanent split capacitor AC induction motors or brushless DC motors. We shall now look at this system in more detail. Types of Fans and Blowers Air moving devices are generally described as being either a type of fan (Fig. 1 a) or a centrifugal blower (Fig. 1 b). The main difference between fans and blowers is in their <b>flow</b> and <b>pressure</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Fans deliver air in an overall direction that is parallel to the fan blade axis and can be designed to deliver a high flow rate, but tend to work against low pressure. Blowers tend to deliver air in a direction that is perpendicular to the blower axis at a relatively low flow rate, but against high pressure. There are several types of fans, some of the most common being propeller, tube axial and vane axial styles. Propeller fans are the simplest type of fan, consisting of only a motor and propeller. One problem with propeller fans is that tip vortices are produced by the pressure differential across the airfoil section. A tube axial fan (the most common type in electronic cooling systems) is similar to a propeller fan, but also has a venturi around the propeller to reduce the vortices. The vane axial fan has vanes that trai...|$|R

It was modeled after the flashing process encountered by the accumulator of air-source heat pump systems. Three small pyrex glass vessels were used to hold the refrigerant and allow for visualization studies of the flashing process. Baseline experiments were run varying initial pressure, initial refrigerant amount, orifice diameter, and vessel geometry. Three sets of experiments were run using two passive enhancement methods (the addition of steel balls {{and the addition of}} small amounts of oil) and one active enhancement method (the addition of an immersion heater). Furthermore, a lumped-parameter analytical model was developed from basic thermodynamic principles that predicted the rate of depressurization for the flashing refrigerant. The study showed that the initial refrigerant amount and the orifice size had the greatest influence on the mass <b>flow</b> and <b>pressure</b> <b>characteristics</b> during each sixty second test. The initial pressure and vessel volume had less of an impact under the conditions tested. Two of the enhancement methods consistently increased the amount of refrigerant flashed during the tests as compared to the baseline data for the same initial conditions.

Materials: an ex vivo pulsatile flow model was used in which temperature, velocity, <b>flow,</b> <b>pressure</b> and viscosity <b>characteristics</b> were designed to simulate the carotid circulation. Methods: carotid endarterectomy specimens excised as intact cylinders (n = 28) were subjected to a standardised angioplasty procedure using radiological guidance. Emboli collected in filters placed distally were counted and sized using microscopy. Results: median number of emboli during angioplasty was 133 (range 15 - 1331). Median size of the largest embolus was 700 microns (range 75 - 2400). Severity of stenosis correlated with increased maximum size (r = 0. 55, p = 0. 012).

40|$|Forced {{convection}} boiling flow, {{often referred to}} as two-phase flow, is a common phenomenon which occurs in many industrial processes. The relationship between the total pressure drop in a channel containing two-phase flow and the mass flux of the flow is known as the <b>pressure</b> <b>characteristic</b> curve. If any part of <b>pressure</b> <b>characteristic</b> curve contains a negative slope, flow instabilities might occur in the channel. Flow instabilities are unwanted because they can reduce the efficiency of the industrial process. In this study experimental work has been done to analyze the behavior of the <b>pressure</b> <b>characteristic</b> curve in two-phase flow by applying a sensitivity analysis. The parameters which were analyzed in the sensitivity analysis were inlet pressure, subcooling temperature, total heating power and heating power distribution. Also, experimental results from this study were compared with the results from a numerical study of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>pressure</b> curve of two-phase flow [1].
