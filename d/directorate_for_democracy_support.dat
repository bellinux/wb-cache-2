40|$|This article offers {{perspectives}} on the prospects for democratisation in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region {{in the light of}} political developments since 2010, with particular reference to international <b>democracy</b> <b>support.</b> An introduction shares certain assumptions about <b>democracy</b> <b>support’s</b> general record before threats and opportunities to <b>democracy</b> <b>support</b> arising from developments in the region are discussed. Next <b>democracy</b> <b>support’s</b> response to those developments is examined, while the fourth section highlights some challenges <b>for</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>support</b> in the region and beyond. Throughout, discussion is contextualised within the larger literature on democratisation. Final remarks lead to the conclusion that developments in the region both present challenges that should be viewed as opportunities, and offer opportunities that will be challenging to address, not just <b>for</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>support</b> in the region and further afield {{but in terms of the}} guidance that democratisation studies have to offer...|$|R

The EU has better equipped itself institutionally, financially and conceptually, by strengthening its bottom up grassroots approach to democracy support; resources earmarked for supporting civil society have been increased, the budget for the European Instrument <b>for</b> <b>Democracy</b> and Human Rights (EIDHR) has been beefed up, and the strengthened EU Delegations have be come more empowered {{to reach out to}} groups at the local grass roots level behind democracy activities; The European Endowment <b>for</b> <b>Democracy</b> (EED) was created with the mandate to support individuals and organizations in neighbouring countries that work <b>for</b> <b>democracy.</b> Whether this translates into a more effective strategy <b>for</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>support,</b> however, remains to be seen.

As indicators of the right-wing political conservatism, measures of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing political orientation were used. Two path diagrams were proposed: the second diagram showed a proper degree of fit and proposes a positive covariance between RWA, SDO and right-wing political orientation. The diagram also suggests that RWA, SDO and right-wing political orientation exert a direct influence on the criminalization of social protest, while SDO and RWA exert an indirect influence on <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>democracy.</b> Finally, <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>democracy</b> present an inverse correlation with the criminalization of social protest...|$|R

50|$|For his {{campaign}} platform, Nenshi proposed {{to abolish the}} $4,800 granted to home builders, aiming to save the city $33 million per annum. According to Nenshi, the subsidy over a decade contributed to the municipal debt of $1.5 billion. Nenshi wants the free market factors to take hold of the housing market and developers to contribute to funding infrastructure to far reaching suburbs by paying levies. The Manning Centre <b>for</b> Building <b>Democracy</b> <b>supports</b> the motion <b>for</b> the principle of capitalist free market values.

40|$|Many Latin American {{countries}} democratized between 1975 and 2000, {{and research}} has confirmed that contemporary Latin Americans hold democratic political attitudes. Using AmericasBarometer surveys of 18 countries from 2008, {{we examine the}} commitment of Latin Americans to three democratic attitudes – preference <b>for</b> <b>democracy</b> over other forms of government, support for general participation rights, and tolerance for participation by system critics. We also explore the impact of personal resources, crime and corruption, evaluation of system performance, social capital, and the sociopolitical context on democratic attitudes. A preference <b>for</b> <b>democracy</b> and <b>support</b> <b>for</b> citizens’ participation rights are strong, but tolerance {{is lower than the}} other attitudes. Evidence is found for acculturation – that Latin Americans acquire democratic attitudes by living in democratic regimes and through education.

40|$|Strictly {{quantitative}} and qualitative approaches to measuring regime support en-tail strong assumptions. When these assumptions are violated, as they often are, such measures lose much of their validity. I propose a qualitative-quantitative measure of regime support that blends several approaches: interviews, focus groups, Q-sorts, and public opinion surveys. Over 250 subjects from Santiago, Chile and Buenos Aires, Argentina generate these data and I present them {{in the form of}} multidimensional regime support profiles. These results help illuminate the contributions and shortcom-ings of extant measures, and point to fruitful ways of operationalizing regime support in large-n analysis. Better measurement is essential to connecting regime support with macro-political outcomes. If widespread <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>democracy</b> is essential <b>for</b> democratic stability and quality, conclusions from recent elite and mass opinion surveys across Latin America are sobering: rising support for populism (Seligson 2007), low preference <b>for</b> <b>democracy,</b> limited <b>support</b> <b>for</b> political rights, civil liberties, and support for authoritarianism if it would resolve economic problems (UNDP 2004, Camp 2001).
