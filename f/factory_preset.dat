50|$|At 1 kHz, the 77DX has an {{output of}} -50 to -56dbm, {{depending}} on the pattern selection. The output impedance is user-selectable; <b>factory</b> <b>preset</b> at 250 ohms, and changeable to 30 or 150 ohms. The microphone has a fairly flat response. In the cardioid (unidirectional) pattern, it is level from approximately 150 Hz to 2 kHz, with a slight rise peaking at just under 5 kHz, then dropping approximately 3dB/octave to 20 kHz.|$|E
5000|$|Jean Michel Jarre {{uses the}} laser harp {{in almost every}} concert, with the {{exception}} of Aero and the Oxygene 30th Anniversary Tour. He almost always uses it in the third part of Second Rendez-Vous, but has also used it for tracks like Third Rendez-Vous, Chronologie 3, Calypso 2, [...] Oxygene 7 and Time Machine. The characteristic sound of the laser harp in Jarre's performances comes from a <b>factory</b> <b>preset</b> on the Elka Synthex synthesizer.|$|E

C02 is not a recommended propellant for the Promaster or any electropneumatic marker, as the cold liquid [...] can destroy a solenoid valve. Instead, regulated High Pressure Air or Nitrogen systems are recommended although [...] may be used if an Anti-siphon tube has been installed inside the [...] bottle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sound of}} the Wavestation is {{familiar}} to users of the Apple Macintosh, since the startup chime that has featured on every Mac from the Quadra 700 to the Quadra 800 was created by Jim Reekes on a Korg Wavestation. [...] Reekes said, [...] "The startup sound was done in my home studio on a Korg Wavestation. It's a C Major chord, played with both hands stretched out as wide as possible (with 3rd at the top, if I recall)." [...] The sound in question is a slightly modified [...] "Sandman" [...] <b>factory</b> <b>preset.</b>|$|E
50|$|The same year, {{they also}} {{produced}} the cheaper analog-only SDS-8, which featured a single, non-expandable desktop-style brain with one unalterable <b>factory</b> <b>preset</b> and one custom user preset for each channel. The SDS-8 kit was supplied with four tom pads and a bass pad, using similar hardware {{to the earlier}} SDS-V, but in a more budget style, such as using jack leads instead of XLR connectors. The sounds were similar to the SDS-V, but, to the discerning ear, {{not up to the}} same quality. However, the kit has remained a popular alternative to the SDS-V for those seeking analogue Simmons sounds.|$|E

5000|$|A default, in {{computer}} science, {{refers to the}} preexisting value of a user-configurable setting that is assigned to a software application, computer program or device. Such settings are also called <b>presets</b> or <b>factory</b> <b>presets,</b> especially for electronic devices. The Oxford English Dictionary dates this usage to the mid-1960s, as {{a variant of the}} older meaning of [...] "failure in performance".|$|R
5000|$|On the downside, most HTIBs {{lack the}} {{features}} and [...] "tweakability" [...] of home theater components which are sold separately. For example, while a standalone home theater amplifier may offer extensive equalization options, a HTIB amplifier may simply provide a few factory-set EQ presets. As well, while a standalone home theatre subwoofer may contain {{a range of}} sound-shaping circuitry, such as a crossover control, a phase inversion switch, and a parametric equalizer, a HTIB subwoofer system usually has its crossover point set at the factory, {{which means that the}} user cannot change it. In some cases, the <b>factory</b> <b>preset</b> crossover point on an HTIB subwoofer may cause it to sound too [...] "boomy" [...] in a room.|$|E
50|$|A quirk that catches many first-time users is {{that the}} lower right preset and user memory buttons {{disengage}} most programmable controls {{to the right of}} the arpeggiator section when a user or <b>factory</b> <b>preset</b> is used. The controls {{to the right of the}} arpeggiator are only live when the yellow manual button is selected. The controls are analog switches and potentiometers, but do not adjust the synth cards directly. They are supplied with hi/low logic voltages or 0-5 volt voltages. Multiplexers and analog to digital converters read the settings, then send them in digital form to the CPU. The CPU then converts these parameters to analog control voltages, and sends them to the analog voice cards and envelope gates. It is a remarkably stable hybrid pioneer with a great analog sound.|$|E
50|$|The newest {{version of}} the Mandala, mk2.9, is a {{standard}} class-compliant USB MIDI controller (no special drivers required) which uses a computer as its sound source. When the pad is struck it sends a MIDI trigger note with velocity {{as well as a}} position value (in the form of a MIDI continuous controller) across a USB cable into a computer. A Virtual Brain program is included with mk2.9 and has a set of included instrument samples and multiple effects (filters, delay, distortion, etc.) which can be applied to individual zones or to the overall surface. Unlimited user samples can also be added to the included sound library. Any parameter of any effect can be controlled by the position (0-127) or velocity (0-127) of a surface strike, resulting in effects such as bending pitch, changing delay time, or increasing reverb as the pad is played from center to edge. The position controller and velocity controller can be scaled to the player's liking. <b>Factory</b> <b>preset</b> sound configurations are included with the Virtual Brain as well as unlimited empty slots for user created presets. Drummers can also modify panning and note settings for each zone. The Virtual Brain program is not required to play the Mandala because the pad is a MIDI controller that can trigger any software that accepts MIDI input.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "patch" [...] on the Quadrasynth {{can contain}} 1, 2, 3 or 4 of these tones. However, {{polyphony}} decreases as more tones are used. For example, a 1-tone patch would have 64-note polyphony, a 2-tone patch would have 32-note polyphony, and a 4-tone patch {{would only have}} 16-note polyphony. Patches can only be stored in the User bank. All other banks are <b>factory</b> <b>presets</b> which cannot be overwritten. The Quadrasynth was typical of synthesizers of the early 90s, featuring a digital, menu-based editing system. Editing user patches could be tedious if the user is unfamiliar with its complex editing structure or has not read the manual.|$|R
5000|$|The presets of the D-50, {{authored}} by Eric Persing and Adrian Scott, were well {{received by the}} artists' community, {{and most of them}} can be heard on numerous commercial albums of the late 1980s. The D-50's <b>factory</b> <b>presets</b> have enjoyed a long legacy, as patches like [...] "Digital Native Dance", [...] "Staccato Heaven", [...] "Fantasia", [...] "Glass Voices", and [...] "Living Calliope" [...] are so common that they border on cliche. Some other D-50 presets live on in every machine that conforms to the General MIDI specification, including [...] "Intruder FX", [...] "Fantasia" [...] (alternatively called [...] "New Age Pad"), [...] "Soundtrack", [...] "Atmosphere", and [...] "Nylon Atmosphere".|$|R
50|$|On February 11, 2013, hackers {{broke into}} the EAS {{networks}} in Great Falls, Montana and Marquette, Michigan to broadcast an emergency alert that zombies have risen from their graves in several counties in Montana and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Stations KRTV in Great Falls, WBUP and WNMU-TV in Marquette broke into programming to broadcast the false alerts. It was determined {{that a number of}} stations installed station equipment without firewall or security protection, and further neglected to change default factory logins or passwords, opting to use <b>factory</b> <b>presets</b> instead. Because of this, the FCC, FEMA, equipment manufacturers, as well as trade groups, including the Michigan Association of Broadcasters, urged broadcasters to change their passwords and to recheck their security measures.|$|R
40|$|All too often, {{stationary}} {{batteries are}} not correctly or adequately charged. This {{leads to a}} shortened battery life and may also cause a premature and sometimes catastrophic battery failure. It is the author’s experience that almost 50 percent of all stationary batteries are not being properly charged. This observation is based upon hundreds of site visits, multiple battery system tests, and the examination of numerous maintenance records. Battery charging is a complex process. Consideration has {{to be given to}} several fixed and varying parameters such as battery type and chemistry, battery application, and the environment in which the battery is being used. In many cases batteries are installed and put into service connected to chargers that have been <b>factory</b> <b>preset</b> and not readjusted to suit the particular batteries that they are charging. The intent {{of this paper is to}} educate battery users on battery charging and detail the proper methods of float (maintenance) charging, recharging, equalize (boost) charging, adjusting the charge for temperature and limiting the charge current when necessary. Since there are many types of stationary batteries in use today and each chemistry has its own unique and often complex charging requirement, for the purpose of this paper, the discussion is restricted to the lead-acid type which is by far the most commonly used stationary battery. The focus is on maintaining battery health and extending battery life and reliability. The suitability of certain types of battery chargers is also discussed. The basic building block of a battery is the cell. Cells that are connected in series to achieve a required voltage are called a battery string. Cells that are connected in a series-parallel configuration can be referred to as a battery, battery system or battery plant...|$|E
2500|$|The Residents {{recorded}} the dramatic album Demons Dance Alone (also a tour and DVD in 2002) and Animal Lover in 2005. Singer Molly Harvey {{began as a}} Ralph employee but by the mid-90s contributed to {{virtually all of the}} Residents' many projects. The Residents' increased reliance on Harvey, essentially handing her half of the vocal duties since at least Demons Dance Alone, parallels their artistic revitalization. Nolan Cook, Carla Fabrizio, Toby Dammit, Eric Drew Feldman, and many other artists continuously worked with the band over the last five years, recording and performing live. The new artists helped to counter what Allmusic derided as a [...] "sonic palette [...] <b>factory</b> <b>presets</b> from their new Macintosh audio" [...] of the CD-ROM era.|$|R
5000|$|Carbone was {{nominated}} for best soundtrack {{for his work on}} the award winning short film 'Woody' at the 2013 APRA Screen Music Awards [...] and was again nominated at the 2015 APRA Screen Music Awards for his work for Tahiti Tourism. His most recent work includes production of the top selling sample pack 'Carl Cox - My Life in Music' which was awarded 10/10 by Computer Music Magazine quoting 'One of the most essential sample packs we have ever heard'. Carbone also designed 'Carbon Electra', a virtual analog synthesiser released in 2015 that features <b>factory</b> <b>presets</b> from internationally acclaimed artists including Mike Huckaby, DJ Pierre, Freemasons, Kosheen, D-Product and Dom Kane. Carbon Electra received several positive reviews in major magazines including Sound on Sound, DJ Mag, Computer Music and was awarded the Music Tech Magazine ‘Editors Choice Award’.|$|R
50|$|Formants {{are mainly}} {{associated}} with modeling the human voice, but have other uses as well. Formants {{are present in}} all instruments that use a resonating body, like the violin, viola, cello, bass viol, bassoon, saxophone, English horn, clarinet, oboe, acoustic guitar, etc. The fixed body of the instrument acts like a set of fixed frequency band pass filters, which is what a formant is. The resonating body instrument was previously very difficult to model using the DX7 family of FM synthesizers. There was an obvious lack of accurate real instrument patches in the <b>factory</b> <b>presets</b> for these synths and in the user produced patch libraries. Modeling this type of instrument is child's play using the FS1R using the formant wave form. This capability is largely unknown due to the path synthesizer development had taken, the sample-based synthesizers had just gained favor, which bypassed the need for combining formant synthesis with FM.|$|R

50|$|The JD-800 {{combines}} sample playback {{with digital}} synthesis, {{a process that}} Roland calls Linear Arithmetic synthesis, a technique Roland had been using to great effect in the Roland D-50. The JD-800 has 108 waveforms built-in, but these can be expanded via PCM-cards. There are waveforms {{in a variety of}} categories, like; analog synth, acoustic instruments, like guitars, woodwind, brass and voices. Most of these waveforms are very short and are designed to give character to the attack portion of a sound, while some longer ones are designed for creating pads, or the sustained part of a patch. The JD-800 was the first instrument from Roland to have its core sound set of waveforms developed entirely in the United States, under a short-lived branch of Roland's R&D-LA office in Culver City, California. The core sampled waveforms and <b>Factory</b> <b>presets</b> of the JD-800 were created by Eric Persing.|$|R
