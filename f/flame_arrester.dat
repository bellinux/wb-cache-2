50|$|As {{with all}} high-alcohol beverages, Bacardi 151 is flammable. Bacardi 151 has {{multiple}} warnings {{on the label}} of the bottle stating {{that it should not}} be ignited or exposed to an open flame. Bottles are also equipped with a stainless steel <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> crimped onto the neck of the bottle to prevent the rum inside the bottle from igniting, in case a consumer ignores the warnings and applies the rum to a source of ignition (e.g. a flaming pan or dish, a flamb√©). Despite the warnings against ignition and the <b>flame</b> <b>arrester,</b> consumers have claimed to have been burned by people who ignored repeated warnings, removed the <b>flame</b> <b>arrester,</b> and exposed the bottle to an open flame.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>arresters</b> are {{passive devices}} with no moving parts. They prevent the {{propagation}} of flame from the exposed side of the unit to the protected side {{by the use of}} metal matrix creating a torturous path called a flame cell or element. All detonation <b>flame</b> <b>arresters</b> operate on the same principle: removing heat from the flame as it attempts to travel through narrow passages with walls of metal or other heat-conductive material, but unlike <b>flame</b> <b>arresters,</b> detonation <b>flame</b> <b>arresters</b> must be built to withstand extreme pressures that travel at supersonic velocities, [...] at 2500 m/s is not uncommon with a group D Gas.|$|R

50|$|A {{detonation}} <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> (also spelled arrestor) is {{a device}} fitted {{to the opening}} of an enclosure or to the connecting pipe work of a system of enclosures and whose intended function is to allow flow but prevent the transmission of flame propagating at supersonic velocity.|$|E
50|$|Detonation <b>flame</b> <b>arresters</b> made by most {{manufacturers}} employ {{layers of}} metal ribbons with crimped corrugations. The internal narrow passages of the crimped corrugations {{make up the}} element matrix. These passages are measured as the hydraulic diameter and are made smaller for gases having smaller maximum experimental safe gaps (MESG).|$|R
50|$|On a fuel storage vent, <b>flame</b> <b>arresters</b> {{also serve}} a {{secondary}} purpose of allowing air pressure to equalize inside the tank when fuel is added or removed, while also preventing insects from flying or crawling into the vent piping and fouling the fuel in the tanks and pipes.|$|R
40|$|A very {{important}} issue of design and manufacture of <b>flame</b> <b>arresters</b> gratings made of crimped metallic ribbon is the determination of technological parameters needed for manufacture of geared drums used for undulation of metallic ribbon. All these parameters shall be determined depending upon undulation critical height specific hcrt of each gas or mixture of combustible gas. Drums are assembled in a device manually or mechanically driven. After each type of undulation, the two functional characteristics of arresting flame shall be checked; pressure drop (hydraulic resistance) entered by the <b>arrester,</b> <b>flame</b> arresting through arreste...|$|R
50|$|Under normal {{operating}} conditions the <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> permits a relatively {{free flow of}} gas or vapor through the piping system. If the mixture is ignited and the flame begins to travel back through the piping, the arrester will prohibit the flame from moving back to the gas source.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{patented}} detonation <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> {{was developed}} by Nicholas Roussakis et al., [...] and was issued on March 20, 1990. Its need was initially driven by new environmental legislation, namely the Clean Air Act of the USA. Regular flame arresters had been around for years, but they had very limited applications.|$|E
50|$|Flame arresters {{should be}} {{periodically}} inspected {{to make sure}} they are free of dirt, insects using it as a nest, or corrosion. The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board concluded that an uninspected and badly corroded <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> failed to prevent a 2006 explosion at a wastewater treatment plant in Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E
50|$|For <b>flame</b> <b>arresters</b> used as {{a safety}} device, the mesh must be {{protected}} from damage due to being dropped or struck by another object, and the mesh must be capable of rigidly retaining its shape during the propagation of a flame front. Any shifting of the individual wires {{that make up the}} mesh can create an opening large enough to allow the flame to penetrate and spread beyond the barrier.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>arresters</b> {{should be}} used only in the gas group and {{conditions}} they have been designed and tested for. Since the depth on an arrester is specified for certain conditions, changes in the temperature, pressure, or composition of the gases entering the arrester can cause the flame spatial velocity to increase, making {{the design of the}} arrester insufficient to stop the flame front ("propagation"). The deflagration may continue downstream of the arrester.|$|R
40|$|Immersed <b>flame</b> <b>arresters</b> {{are used}} in the {{chemical}} industry for gas explosion protection. The explosive gas passes a water layer thus establishing arc-through safety up to a certain gas flow velocity. This flow velocity limit value can be considerably increased by use of an air lift loop-type bubble column with suspended solid particles in the water layer. By the suspension the distance between the individual gas bubbles is increased. Considering the gas bubble distance, a simple connection between the safety engineering characteristics laminar frame propagation velocity and normal split width at one hand and the limit gas velocity at the other hand has been foundSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: ZN 737 (291) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
50|$|Most {{detonation}} <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> {{applications are}} in systems which collect gases emitted by liquids and solids. These systems, {{commonly used in}} many industries, may be called vapor control systems. The gases which are vented to atmosphere or controlled via vapor control systems are typically flammable. If the conditions are such that ignition occurs, a flame inside or outside of the system could result, {{with the potential to}} do catastrophic damage.|$|E
50|$|A <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> (also {{called a}} {{deflagration}} arrester) functions by absorbing {{the heat from}} a flame front traveling at sub-sonic velocities, thus dropping the burning gas/air mixture below its auto-ignition temperature: consequently, the flame cannot survive. The heat is absorbed through channels (passages) designed into an element. These channels are chosen and measured as the mesg (Maximum Experimental Safe Gap) of the gas for a particular installation.These passages can be regular, like crimped metal ribbon or wire mesh or a sheet metal plate with punched holes, or irregular, {{such as those in}} random packing.|$|E
50|$|Detonation <b>Flame</b> <b>Arrester</b> {{products}} {{were created in}} response to environmental regulations (such as The Clean Air Act) which required liquid product storage terminals and hydrocarbon processing plants to control evaporative hydrocarbon emissions from loading and storage operations. This process is called vapor control. Two types of recognized vapor control technologies are commonly used; carbon adsorption vapor recovery and vapor destruction or combustion. Vapor destruction systems include elevated flare systems, enclosed flare systems, burner and catalytic incineration systems, and waste gas boilers. Both systems require flame or detonation flame arresters to maximize safety.Detonation flame arresters are used in many industries, including refining, pharmaceutical, chemical, and petrochemical, pulp and paper, oil exploration and production, sewage treatment, landfills, mining, power generation, and bulk liquids transportation.|$|E
40|$|The paper first {{outlines}} the practical need for explosion arresters, including pressures arising from recent legislation. The nature of pipeline explosions is then considered, including {{the problem of}} potential transition to detonation together with the implications for arrester testing. Current testing procedures for <b>flame</b> and detonation <b>arresters</b> are then reviewed and potential problems identified. Finally, recent results from potentially more rigorous and reproducible testing approaches are discussed...|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} {{the capability to}} predict {{the effectiveness of a}} <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> in the cooling of hot combustion gases expelled through a <b>flame</b> <b>arrester,</b> the U. S. Bureau of Mines developed an equilibrium. model and one-and three-dimensional transient thermal models of a <b>flame</b> <b>arrester,</b> which were used to predict the temperature evolution within the arrester and the maximum temperature at the external surface of the arrester. The models account for convective and conductive heat transport within the arrester and radiative losses at the exit surface. The gas flow through the arrester is established from an empirically derived relationship between the gas velocity and the pressure gradient across the arrester. Lateral heat loss from the arrester to the enclosure wall is accounted for in the three-dimensional model. The model calculations for maximum outside surface temperature of the arrester showed an approximate agreement with measured values for vent-area-to-enclosure-volume ratios between 12 and 28 in 222 ÃÜ 0 ac 2 ft- 3...|$|E

A WC 55 Y support hauler with a load of 55 tons has been developed, achieving a safe, high efficiency, non-demolition, ‚Äúpoint-to-point‚Äù transportation of the LLTCC hydraulic support, and improves the efficiency of LLTCC coalface relocation.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{results obtained}} from an experimental programme {{to determine the}} explosion development characteristics of mixtures of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) and carbon monoxide in oxygen plus nitrogen atmospheres. The main complex experimental pipe configuration and mixtures studied reproduced, as accurately as possible, a process configuration identical to that used in a real operational process plant. A commercial <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> device (nominal channel size 0. 475 mm) was also tested on occasions. The test pipe configurations used 300 mm nominal bore steel pipe. The main test series were conducted in a configuration that included three standard 1. 5 D bends, as part of on overall pipe length of ca. 20 m. In certain tests the <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> was placed after the third bend, furthest from the spark ignition source. Some initial commissioning tests were made using a single straight section, 4 m long. This allowed some overpressure development measurements of VCM mixtures to be compared with those for ethylene mixtures. In addition the flame acceleration characteristics of VCM/CO/O 2 /N 2 mixture in the full 20 m geometry have been quantified and compared to the behaviour observed with propane/O 2 /N 2 mixtures. For both fuels a distinct change in flame acceleration characteristics with reduced nitrogen content was observed. Some of the present observations give rise to some serious concerns regarding the methods used to select explosion arrester...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of RETIMET metal foam as a <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> on explosion-proof enclosures was {{investigated by the}} U. S. Bureau of Mines both in laboratory tests and at the U. S. Mine Safety and Health Administration's (MSHA's) Approval and Certification Center, Triadelphia, WV. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop a permissible pressure vent for use on lightweight, vented, explosion- proof enclosures. In laboratory tests, four grades of RETIMET, a stainless steel foam material, were evaluated: (1) 45 NC- 7, (2) 45 NC- 13, (3) 80 NC- 7, and (4) 80 NC- 13. Explosive gas mixtures were prepared by a dynamic flow system. Ignition was by a low-voltage arc. Each grade of RETIMET metal foam successfully arrested the flame front in all methane-air tests. To evaluate RETIMET metal foam on large, commercial size enclosures, a multicompartmented enclosure was designed and tested in MSHA's explosion gallery in Triadelphia, WV. Extensive explosion testing revealed that a minimum vent-area-to-enclosure-volume ratio of 11. 33 in 2 /ft 3 is required to keep internal pressure rises below 3 psig. The RETIMET metal foam functioned satisfactorily in all tests as evidenced by the absence of external ignitions...|$|E
40|$|Diesel {{engines of}} powered lifting and {{transporting}} applianoes are often considered sufficiently protected {{to be safe}} for use in industrial areas where flammable concentrations of gases and vapours may occur. The work described in this Note was carried out to obtain quantitative information about the surface temperatures of an air cooled engine and qualitative information regarding emission of sparks {{and the ability of}} an air intake filter to function as a flame arreater preventing flashba~k of flame from the engine to the atmosphere. The results obtained have shown that dangerously high surface temperature values can be attained on the surfaces of the components of exhaust systems under various working conditions. Sparks and flames were observed in the exhaust system of the engine and it was shown that an oil bath,typej,air,,''"v cleaner cannot be regarded as a <b>flame</b> <b>arrester.</b> Suggestions are made as to the modifications and additional appliances necessary to flameproof an engine for safe working in industrial areas in which flammable gas and vapour concentrations may occur.
