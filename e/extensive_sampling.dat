5|$|Wildflower is {{the second}} studio album {{recorded}} by Australian electronic music group the Avalanches. It was first released for streaming on Apple Music on 1 July 2016, and saw a full release a week later on 8 July. It was issued through Modular Recordings, Astralwerks, XL Recordings, and EMI. Production of the album was led by Robbie Chater with assistance from Tony Di Blasi and lasted nearly 16 years, commencing shortly {{after the release of}} their debut album, Since I Left You, in November 2000 and not concluding until March 2016. The album features multiple guest collaborators providing vocals and live instrumentation across its 21 tracks. Wildflower also features <b>extensive</b> <b>sampling,</b> especially from 1960s psychedelic music, and relates to the era through themes of counterculture and anti-establishment. Chater described the album's structure as a road trip from a hyperrealistic urban environment to somewhere remote and far away while on LSD.|$|E
25|$|The bluespotted {{trevally}} is an inshore fish, generally inhabiting {{coastal waters}} throughout its range. The species {{is known to}} inhabit shallow bays over sand, mud, and rarely seagrass bottoms, as well as slightly deeper waters in bays. <b>Extensive</b> <b>sampling</b> across the Gulf of Carpentaria indicates the maximum biomass for the species occurs at around 28.1 m depth, indicating the species preferentially inhabits substrate of this depth.|$|E
25|$|G-funk is {{a fusion}} genre of music which {{combines}} gangsta rap and funk. It {{is generally considered}} to have been invented by west coast rappers and made famous by Dr. Dre. It incorporates multi-layered and melodic synthesizers, slow hypnotic grooves, a deep bass, background female vocals, the <b>extensive</b> <b>sampling</b> of P-Funk tunes, and a high-pitched portamento saw wave synthesizer lead. Unlike other earlier rap acts that also utilized funk samples (such as EPMD and the Bomb Squad), G-funk often used fewer, unaltered samples per song.|$|E

25|$|The {{instrumental}} temperature record {{provides the}} temperature of Earth's climate system from the historical network of in situ measurements of surface air temperatures and ocean surface temperatures. Data are collected at thousands of meteorological stations, buoys and ships around the globe. The longest-running temperature record is the Central England temperature data series, that starts in 1659. The longest-running quasi-global record starts in 1850. In recent decades more <b>extensive</b> <b>sampling</b> of ocean temperatures at various depths have begun allowing estimates of ocean heat content but these do not form part of the global surface temperature datasets.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{notification}} of a potentially hazardous waste site, the EPA conducts a Preliminary Assessment/Site Inspection (PA/SI), which involves records reviews, interviews, visual inspections, and limited field sampling. Information from the PA/SI {{is used by}} the EPA to develop a Hazard Ranking System (HRS) score to determine the CERCLA status of the site. Sites that score high enough to be listed typically proceed to a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS). The RI includes an <b>extensive</b> <b>sampling</b> program and risk assessment that defines {{the nature and extent of}} the site contamination and risks. The FS is used to develop and evaluate various remediation alternatives. The preferred alternative is presented in a Proposed Plan for public review and comment, followed by a selected alternative in a ROD. The site then enters into a Remedial Design phase and then the Remedial Action phase. Many sites include Long-Term Monitoring. 5-year reviews once the Remedial Action has been completed are required whenever hazardous substances are left onsite above levels safe for unrestricted use.|$|E

500|$|Their {{first public}} {{performance}} {{as members of}} Pussy Riot was in November 2011. Several masked women performed [...] "Osvobodi Bruschatku" [...] ("Release the Cobblestones") atop a scaffold in a Moscow subway and {{from the top of}} trolley cars, while tearing apart down feather pillows, showering feathers onto the train platform below. The song recommended that Russians protest upcoming parliamentary elections by throwing cobblestones during street clashes. [...] "Your ballots will be used as toilet paper by the Presidential Administration", the group said on its blog. Their first video was uploaded to YouTube on November 6. The musical track once again used <b>extensive</b> <b>sampling,</b> this time from the Angelic Upstarts' 1978 recording [...] "Police Oppression".

500|$|In a 1995 {{contribution}} to Faune de Madagascar on Malagasy bats, Randolph Peterson and colleagues listed four species of Miniopterus on Madagascar {{and the nearby}} Comoros, including the small Miniopterus manavi with a broad distribution on both Madagascar and the Comoros. However, during {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, molecular studies have revealed that Miniopterus, a widespread genus in the Old World, is much more species-rich than previously thought. A 2008 study comparing sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b and D-loop markers found two distinct, unrelated groups within the supposed M.manavi from the Comoros; both groups were also found on Madagascar. The next year, Steven Goodman and colleagues revisited the group with more <b>extensive</b> <b>sampling</b> on Madagascar. They separated three species within the former [...] "M.manavi": M.manavi itself in the Central Highlands, M.griveaudi (previously a subspecies of M.manavi) on Anjouan, Grande Comore, and northern and western Madagascar, and the newly described Miniopterus aelleni on Anjouan and northern and western Madagascar. The specific name aelleni honors Prof. Villy Aellen of the Natural History Museum of Geneva, who has done much research on African bats. Within M.aelleni, Goodman and colleagues found some differentiation (3.4% sequence divergence in cytochrome b sequences) between individuals from Montagne d'Ambre in northern Madagascar and those from Anjouan and Ankarana, near Montagne d'Ambre; the cytochrome b divergence between M.aelleni and other Malagasy Miniopterus is 7 to 10%.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{potential}} legal and financial risks that their composition methods entailed, The JAMs next created [...] "Whitney Joins The JAMs", a house mash-up built around samples of Whitney Houston, Isaac Hayes, Lalo Schifrin's [...] theme tune, and (according to later sleevenotes) Westworld. [...] The lyrical {{theme of the}} piece is the satirical false premise that Whitney Houston had been begged and persuaded to collaborate with The JAMs; Drummond's jubilant lyrics suggest that <b>extensive</b> <b>sampling</b> of Houston's 1987 # 1 single [...] "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)" [...] is evidence of Whitney's dedication to the project.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, Fekner formed his own band City Squad {{composed}} of musicians and non-musicians {{as an extension}} of Queensites, a group of teenagers from Jackson Heights who assisted with the outdoor stencil work. In September, Fekner released his first rap/rock 12" [...] EP on his own Vinyl Gridlock record label. The A-side, [...] "2 4 5 7 9 11" [...] had Kwame Monroe, aka Bear 167, a South Bronx graffiti artist as the guest rapper; and the B-side featured Dave Santaniello on rock vocals on [...] "Rock Steady". [...] On the Apple II, Fekner experimented with early speech synthesis programs, Votrax and SAM-Software Automatic Mouth as vocal tracks on [...] "2 4 5 7 9 11" [...] and on his Idioblast (album) in 1984. [...] In addition to playing keyboards, electronic drums and vocals, he wrote the music and lyrics for the eight songs on the album which featured <b>extensive</b> <b>sampling</b> and tape loops of TV, radio, Native American voices, phone and airport transmissions over rock/rap/hip hop beats. Tracks on the album included Travelogue The 80s, I Get Paid To Clap, The Beat, The Sight Of The Child, Wheels Over Indian Trails and Rapicasso, which Fekner also created as a 6' × 12' six-panel painting. Both the painting and song pay homage to Picasso’s The Three Dancers. Fekner spray painted LCD-style letters on industrial silkscreens to portray three breakdancers, the song’s lyrics acknowledging the work, energy and spirit in breakdancing, rapping and graffiti: [...] "Watch the street, see the modern art, it's the present and future tied to his heart." ...|$|E

40|$|Analysis of {{biochemicals}} {{in single}} cells {{is important for}} understanding cell metabolism, cell cycle, adaptation, disease states, etc. Even the same cell types exhibit heterogeneous biochemical makeup depending on their physiological conditions and interactions with the environment. Conventional methods of mass spectrometry (MS) used {{for the analysis of}} biomolecules in single cells rely on <b>extensive</b> <b>sample</b> preparation. Removing the cells from their natural environment and <b>extensive</b> <b>sample</b> processing could lead to changes in the cellular composition. Ambient ionization methods enable the analysis of samples in their native environment and without <b>extensive</b> <b>sample</b> preparation. 1 The techniques based on the mid infrared (mid-IR) laser ablation of biological materials at 2. 94 μm wavelength utilize the sudden excitation of water that results in phase explosion. 2 Ambient ionization techniques based on mid-IR laser radiation, such as laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) and atmospheric pressure infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (AP IR-MALDI), have successfully demonstrated the ability to directly analyze water-rich tissues and biofluids at atmospheric pressure. 3 - 11 In LAESI the mid-IR laser ablation plume that mostly consists of neutral particulate matter from the sample coalesces with highly charged electrospray droplets to produce ions. Recently, mid-IR ablation of single cells was performed by delivering the mid-IR radiation through an etched fiber. The plume generated from this ablation was postionized by an electrospray enabling the analysis of diverse metabolites in single cells by LAESI-MS. 12 This article describes the detailed protocol for single cell analysis using LAESI-MS.
