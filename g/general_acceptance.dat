5|$|And the {{impressive}} personal {{qualities of the}} Communist leaders, their seeming sincerity, and the coherence and logical nature of their program leads me, at least, toward <b>general</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the first explanation – that the Communists base their policy toward the Kuomintang on a real desire for democracy in China under which there can be orderly economic growth through a stage of private enterprise to eventual socialism without the need of violent social upheaval and revolution.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with these}} <b>general</b> <b>acceptances,</b> many {{movements}} view contraception use {{outside of marriage}} as encouragement to promiscuity. For example, Focus on the Family states,Sex is a powerful drive, {{and for most of}} human history it was firmly linked to marriage and childbearing. Only relatively recently has the act of sex commonly been divorced from marriage and procreation. Modern contraceptive inventions have given many an exaggerated sense of safety and prompted more people than ever before to move sexual expression outside the marriage boundary.|$|R

5|$|The {{first group}} of {{converts}} to Islam in Medina were the clans without great leaders; these clans had been subjugated by hostile leaders from outside. This {{was followed by the}} <b>general</b> <b>acceptance</b> of Islam by the pagan population of Medina, with some exceptions.

Medinans who converted to Islam and helped the Muslim emigrants find shelter became known as the ansar (supporters). Then Muhammad instituted brotherhood between the emigrants and the supporters and he chose Ali as his own brother.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Anatoly Nikolaevich Riabinin named Albertosaurus pericolosus {{based on}} a tooth from China, that {{probably}} belonged to Tarbosaurus. In 1932, Friedrich von Huene renamed Dryptosaurus incrassatus, not considered a nomen dubium by him, to Albertosaurus incrassatus. Because he had identified Gorgosaurus with Albertosaurus, in 1970, Russell also renamed Gorgosaurus sternbergi (Matthew & Brown 1922) into Albertosaurus sternbergi and Gorgosaurus lancensis (Gilmore 1946) into Albertosaurus lancensis. The former species is today seen as a juvenile form of Gorgosaurus libratus, the latter as either identical to Tyrannosaurus or representing a separate genus Nanotyrannus. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul based Albertosaurus megagracilis on a small tyrannosaurid skeleton, specimen LACM 28345, from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. It was renamed Dinotyrannus in 1995, but is now thought to represent a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex. Also in 1988, Paul renamed Alectrosaurus olseni (Gilmore 1933) into Albertosaurus olseni; this has found no <b>general</b> <b>acceptance.</b> In 1989, Gorgosaurus novojilovi (Maleev 1955) was renamed by Bryn Mader and Robert Bradley as Albertosaurus novojilovi; today this {{is seen as a}} synonym of Tarbosaurus.|$|E
