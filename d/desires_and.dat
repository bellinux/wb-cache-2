5|$|Al-Maʿarri was an ascetic, renouncing worldly <b>desires</b> <b>and</b> living secluded {{from others}} while {{producing}} his works. He opposed {{all forms of}} violence. In Baghdad, while being well received, {{he decided not to}} sell his texts, which made it difficult for him to live. This ascetic lifestyle has been compared to similar thought in India during his time.|$|E
5|$|Taoism {{tends to}} {{emphasize}} various {{themes of the}} I Ching, the Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi, such as naturalness, spontaneity, simplicity, detachment from <b>desires,</b> <b>and</b> most important of all, wu wei.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between sexual <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> differentiation of self in couples has been frequently discussed in clinical literature but lacks empirical support. This exploratory study investigates the associations between individual and dyadic {{levels of sexual}} desire, differentiation of self, and couple satisfaction. Similarities and discrepancies in sexual <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> differentiation of self between partners were especially targeted. Partners were {{expected to have a}} lower discrepancy of differentiation of self than unrelated individuals (Bowen's similarity hypothesis). Partners' discrepancy in differentiation of self was expected to be negatively associated with sexual <b>desire,</b> <b>and</b> higher levels of sexual <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> differentiation in the dyad were expected be positively associated with couple satisfaction. Results suggest that partners' similarity regarding differentiation of self predicted individual sexual desire. Other findings suggest that couple satisfaction was positively associated with both sexual <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> differentiation of self. Limitations and clinical implications are discussed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Differentiation of self {{the ability}} to emotionally self-regulate and to {{maintain}} a sense of autonomy within a deep intimate relationship has been proposed as a relevant factor in couple satisfaction, but the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Sexual <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> intimacy have recently drawn increased attention due to the proposal {{that some of the}} relational benefits of long-term intimacy (e. g., predictability) might be detrimental to <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction. This study aimed to test a model illustrating the role played by differentiation of self in couple satisfaction through the underlying mechanisms of sexual <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> intimacy, in a survey of 428 heterosexual individuals. The findings supported the proposed model, suggesting that differentiation of self is a predictor of <b>desire,</b> intimacy <b>and</b> couple satisfaction. <b>Desire</b> mediated the association between differentiation and couple satisfaction, and also the association between differentiation and intimacy. Intimacy mediated the association between <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction. The model was sustained for women, but a different mechanism was found for men. The results provide support for the close association between intimacy, sexual <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction, while suggesting that differentiation of self has a fundamental role in sexual <b>desire,</b> intimacy <b>and</b> couple satisfaction...|$|R
5|$|At birth, infants {{are unable}} to wait for their wants {{and needs to be}} met and exhibit a {{defining}} lack of impulse control. With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate <b>desires</b> <b>and</b> are increasingly able to prolong gratification. Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems.|$|E
5|$|Every full moon, tens of {{thousands}} of pilgrims worship Annamalaiyar by circumambulating the Annamalai hill barefoot. The circumambulation covers a distance of , and is referred as Girivalam.

Offerings are made in a string of tanks, shrines, pillared meditation halls, springs and caves around the hill.|$|E
5|$|Garga Samhita (a work on {{the life}} of Krishna) and Brahma Vaivarta Purana further tell of the {{previous}} birth of Putana as Ratnamala, the daughter of demon king Bali. When she saw Vamana, the previous incarnation of Krishna as a dwarf, she felt a desire to have him as her son and suckle him. She soon changed her mind and decided to kill Vamana, after he acquired all possessions of Bali. Krishna knew her <b>desires</b> <b>and</b> allowed her to fulfil both of them - to suckle him and to attempt to take his life.|$|E

The effects of hormones, somatic disease, and medication on sexual arousability are discussed, as well as the influence of psychological factors, such as stimulus meaning, mood and cognition, and relational context on female sexual <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> arousal. Specific topics to attend to during the anamnesis of sexual <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> arousal problems, and empirically evaluated psychological and pharmacological treatments for these problems are discussed. <...|$|R
40|$|<b>Desired</b> <b>and</b> feared {{possible}} future selves are important motivators {{of behavior and}} provide a temporal context for self-evaluation. Yet little research has examined why people desire some possible selves and fear others. In two studies, we tested the reflection of identity motives for self-esteem, efficacy, meaning, continuity, belonging, and distinctiveness in people’s <b>desired</b> <b>and</b> feared {{possible future}} selves and in their possible future identity structures. As predicted, participants desired especially those possible futures in which motives for self-esteem, efficacy, meaning, and continuity would be satisfied, and they feared especially those in which the same four motives and, marginally, the motive for distinctiveness would be frustrated. Analyses supported an indirect path from belonging via self-esteem to <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> fear. <b>Desired</b> <b>and</b> feared possible future selves reflect potential satisfaction and frustration of these identity motives...|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} measure {{well-being}} more generally, Amartya Sen, Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, and other feminist economists helped develop alternatives to Gross Domestic Product, {{such as the}} Human Development Index. Other models of interest to feminist economists include the labor theory of value, which was most thoroughly developed in Das Capital by Karl Marx. That model considers production as a socially constructed human project and redefines wages as means to earning a living. This refocuses economic models on human innate <b>desires</b> <b>and</b> needs as opposed to monetary incentives.|$|E
5|$|Motivations for {{clitoral}} modification and mutilation vary. Those taking hormones {{or other}} medications {{as part of}} female-to-male transition usually experience dramatic clitoral growth; individual <b>desires</b> <b>and</b> the difficulties of phalloplasty (construction of a penis) often result in the retention of the original genitalia with the enlarged clitoris as a penis analogue (metoidioplasty). However, the clitoris cannot reach {{the size of the}} penis through hormones. A surgery to add function to the clitoris, such as metoidioplasty, is an alternative to phalloplasty that permits retention of sexual sensation in the clitoris.|$|E

5|$|Dhumavati is {{described}} as a giver of siddhis (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles, and a granter of all <b>desires</b> <b>and</b> rewards, including ultimate knowledge and moksha (salvation). Her worship is also prescribed for those who wish to defeat their foes. Dhumavati's worship is considered ideal for unpaired members of society, such as bachelors, widows, and world renouncers as well as Tantrikas. In her Varanasi temple, however, she transcends her inauspiciousness and acquires the status of a local protective deity. There, even married couples worship her. Although she has very few dedicated temples, her worship by Tantric ritual continues in private in secluded places like cremation grounds and forests.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativism about a {{class of}} {{entities}} is the view that that class of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; and modern physicists are eliminativist {{about the existence of}} luminiferous aether. Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental entities that common sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, <b>desires,</b> <b>and</b> the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.|$|E

On the day of yearly Chitra Pournami, the full moon of the Tamil calendar, hundreds {{of thousands}} of pilgrims come from across the world to worship Annamalaiyar. Five temple cars, called ther, with wooden carvings, are used for the procession.|$|E

5|$|In 916 Emperor Taizu (Abaoji) officially {{designated}} {{his eldest}} son, Yelü Bei, as his successor. Succession by primogeniture was a long-held standard in Chinese culture {{but was not}} accepted among the Khitans, creating a friction between Taizu's <b>desires</b> <b>and</b> the beliefs of the Khitan elites, including Taizu's wife, Empress Shulü Ping. Taizu, sensing {{the possibility that the}} succession process would run into difficulty, forced the Khitan leadership to swear allegiance to Yelü Bei after he was installed as heir apparent. To the Khitans, this was considered a radical move. This friction between primogeniture and succession by the strongest candidate would lead to repeated succession crises, the first of which occurred after Taizu's sudden and unexpected death in 926.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} {{of the ceiling}} has had various interpretations in the past, some elements {{of which have been}} contradicted by modern scholarship. Others, such as the identity of the figures in the lunettes and spandrels, continue to defy interpretation. Modern scholars have sought, as yet unsuccessfully, to determine a written source of the theological program of the ceiling and have questioned {{whether or not it was}} entirely devised by the artist himself, who was both an avid reader of the Bible and a genius. Also of interest to some modern scholars is the question of how Michelangelo's own spiritual and psychological state is reflected in the iconography and the expression of the ceiling. One such speculation is that Michelangelo was tormented by conflict between homosexual <b>desires</b> <b>and</b> passionate Christian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Though Dhumavati {{may seem}} to be a goddess to be avoided due to her inauspiciousness, she is {{described}} as tender-hearted and one who gives her devotees whatever they want. In several places, Dhumavati is described as a giver of siddhis (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles and granter of all <b>desires</b> <b>and</b> rewards, including ultimate knowledge and moksha (salvation). Dhumavati's worship is prescribed to ward off all the negativity that she stands for and to transcend the smoke screen to acquire true knowledge. By worshipping and confronting her, the embodiment of the impure, the inauspicious and outside the fringes of society, one can look beyond the arbitrary dichotomies of society and acquire ultimate knowledge to become spiritually enlightened.|$|E

5|$|The Idolmaster series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami {{attributed the}} development of a rhythm game in the series to two reasons. Noting that songs have a strong meaning to the franchise, he had wanted to make the songs that were included in the series' albums but not in its video games to be accessible in that form. He also wanted to create an Idolmaster video game that, while maintaining a producer's viewpoint, has a lighter feel and would allow the player to hum along to the idols as he or she plays. He pointed out that the rhythm game genre fell in line with these two <b>desires,</b> <b>and</b> this led to {{the development of}} Shiny Festa. The team chose to develop for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as he felt it was simple to play on. At the same time, the team also wanted to create scenes where the series' thirteen idols would be able to appear together, and chose to use pre-rendered videos to make this possible. Sakagami also noted that the development team deliberately chose to use a gameplay system in which the note icons float toward the screen's center to attract the player to look at the videos in the background.|$|E
