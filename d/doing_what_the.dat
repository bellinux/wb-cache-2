25|$|The {{problem for}} the {{principal}} is how {{to ensure that the}} agent is <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> principal wants done. Agency theory predicts that if the costs of monitoring the agent are low, the principal will use intrusive methods of control. Intrusive methods include, for the executive branch, such things as inspections, reports, reviews of military plans, and detailed control of the budget, and for Congress, committee oversight hearings and requiring routine reports. For the military agent, if the likelihood that shirking will be detected by the civilian principal is high or if the perceived costs of being punished are too high, the likelihood of shirking is low.|$|E
25|$|Modern liberal {{democracy}} is a compromise between the twin ideals of freedom and democracy. Mosterín emphasizes their differences: freedom comes down to doing what I want to do; democracy, to <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> (<b>the</b> majority of) the others want me to do. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in my personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social life, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) {{in the name of}} the nation, the church or the party. From this point of view, Internet provides a much more attractive model than the obsolete nation-state or the nationalistic movements. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.|$|E
500|$|Davies {{created the}} {{expectation}} of Rose's return in the fourth series by mentioning her in dialogue and featuring Piper in cameo appearances in [...] "Partners in Crime", [...] "The Poison Sky", and [...] "Midnight". Speaking on how Rose's character had changed between her appearances, Davies described the fourth series Rose as [...] "tougher, more independent, and [...] might, at times, seem a little harder". Piper stated she rewatched her earlier episodes to remember how the character spoke and acted as {{she felt she had}} [...] "been playing posh birds" [...] since she left the programme and by contrast [...] "Rose {{is a bit of a}} chav". Rose is re-united with the Doctor near the climax of [...] "The Stolen Earth". Director Graeme Harper insisted that the scene appear [...] "mystical" [...] because the characters' reunion was [...] "the most magical moment" [...] in the entire episode and Ernie Vincze, the Director of Photography for the show, compared the scene's feeling to the 1980s science-fiction film Blade Runner. Davies characterised the reunion between Rose and the Doctor as [...] "the biggest romance [...] has ever seen" [...] and joked that seminal films such as Gone with the Wind should have ended with a Dalek shooting the male lead. He had difficulty splitting up the characters for a second time for the necessity of the plot. He felt that [...] "Rose has to be stupid to fall in love with Doctor #2" [...] because [...] "she's <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> plot demands, not what she'd demand". At one stage he considered giving an explanation that Rose's dimension hopping and the Dalek's meddling with reality had contaminated her with [...] "voidstuff" [...] and that she would die if she stayed in her original universe. In the final episode it is enough for her to stay that the human Doctor needs her and is able to reciprocate her love. Porter felt that the climax of [...] "Journey's End" [...] indicated that [...] "Rose's role as a sidekick has been completed" [...] as she has a second Doctor to humanise, one who she can be equals with.|$|E

2500|$|The Espionage Act of 1917 {{made it a}} {{crime to}} {{interfere}} with the war effort or with military recruitment or to attempt to aid a nation at war with the U.S. [...] Wartime violence on the part of local groups of citizens, sometimes mobs or vigilantes, persuaded some lawmakers that the law was inadequate. In their view the country was witnessing instances of public disorder that represented the public's own attempt to punish unpopular speech in light of the government's inability to do so.

2500|$|The first {{models with}} Abernethy’s {{corporate}} strategy [...] "in the business world's toughest race — the grinding contest against the Big Three automobile makers" [...] were the cars introduced for the 1965 model year. They were called the [...] "Sensible Spectaculars," [...] {{with the new}} Ambassador billed as [...] "a whole new horizon in size, style, stunning performance" [...] for 1965. The 1965 models were a major makeover of the completely new platform that had just been introduced in 1963. American Motors' new cars included the stretched and more luxurious Ambassadors, {{as well as new}} convertibles for the large models. New styling, the more powerful engines, as well as numerous comfort and sports-type options were now emphasized. Abernethy even switched the automaker's advertising agency to promote [...] "a better luxury and sports car image".

2500|$|Wladyslawa Choms, [...] "The Angel of Lvov", headed Zegota in Lvov, {{helped by}} the Church and the Home Army. She {{described}} the Catholic clergy as [...] "invaluable" [...] to the effort, for they supplied blank baptismal certificates from which to create false documents. Wladyslaw Bartoszewski (aka [...] "Teofil"), a co-founder of Zegota, had worked with the Catholic underground movement, the Front for the Rebirth of Poland, and was arrested in a 1940 Nazi purge of the intelligentsia, and sent to Auchwitz. Freed seven months later following pressure from the international Red Cross, Bartoszewski helped Zegota in its rescue efforts. Explaining his motivation, he later said: [...] "I was raised a Catholic and we were taught to love our neighbour. I was <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Bible taught." [...] He was recognised as Righteous Among the Nations in 1963. As head of Zegota's children's section, Irena Sendlerowa placed more that two thousands five hundred Jewish children in convents, orphanages, schools, hospitals and homes. She was captured by the Gestapo in 1943, and crippled by torture.|$|E

Some of her earlier film appearances include roles in Midsummer Night's Dream, Age of Consent, O Lucky Man!, Caligula, Excalibur, 2010, The Long Good Friday, White Nights, When the Whales Came and The Mosquito Coast. She appeared in Some Mother's Son, Painted Lady, The Prince of Egypt and The Madness of King George. One of her other film roles was in Peter Greenaway's The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, as the thief's wife, opposite Michael Gambon. In Teaching Mrs. Tingle, she plays sadistic history teacher Mrs Eve Tingle. In 2007, she claimed director Michael Winner had treated her [...] "like a piece of meat" [...] at a casting call in 1964. Asked about the incident, Winner told The Guardian: [...] "I don't remember asking her to turn around but if I did I wasn't being serious.

We've started work— I've {{done a lot of}} visuals and Damon's done a lot of music but we haven't figured out how they're going to fit together. I can't say much about it yet but it's sort of like a film, but not with one narrative story. There's many stories, told around a bigger story, set to music, and done in live action, animation, all different styles, well... originally it was a film but now we think it's a film and it's a stage thing as well and... look, it's basically us <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> fuck we want without worrying about whether it's for a record company or a film company or whatever. So I'm not sure how it'll pan out, or even if it will happen.

60|$|The {{abstract}} idea, then, of just or due wages, as {{respects the}} labourer, {{is that they}} will consist in a sum of money which will at any time procure for him at least as much labour as he has given, rather more than less. And this equity or justice of payment is, observe, wholly independent of any reference to the number of men who are willing to do the work. I want a horseshoe for my horse. Twenty smiths, or twenty thousand smiths, may be ready to forge it; their number does not in one atom's weight affect the question of the equitable payment of the one who does forge it. It costs him {{a quarter of an hour}} of his life, and so much skill and strength of arm to make that horseshoe for me. Then at some future time I am bound in equity to give a quarter of an hour, and some minutes more, of my life (or of some other person's at my disposal), and also as much strength of arm and skill, and a little more, in making or <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> smith may have need of.|$|E

They train themselves not to think of the rights and wrongs of sexual life, not to tolerate liberties even in their private imaginations. They know it is like carrying a torch into a powder magazine.
