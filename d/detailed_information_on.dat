5|$|Species in {{the genus}} Amphidromus are {{arboreal}} — in other words, they are tree snails. However, more <b>detailed</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> their habits is still lacking. The general feeding habits of these snails are unknown, {{but a few}} species are known to feed on microscopic fungi, lichens or terrestrial algae. Amphidromus themselves are preyed upon by birds, snakes, and probably also by smaller mammals such as rats.|$|E

5|$|Pursuit of {{specific}} and narrow {{areas of interest}} {{is one of the}} most striking possible features of AS. Individuals with AS may collect volumes of <b>detailed</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic. For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography. This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6. Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.|$|E
5|$|Krekeler's text {{uses the}} National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges' {{numerical}} system for recording covered bridges. The {{system is a}} collection of three sets of two digits used to represent the state, the county and the designated bridge respectively. The book includes <b>detailed</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> each state's historic bridges before providing an individual listing of surveyed bridges. A typical page includes two entries on a single page. Each entry includes a description of the bridge, its history, a black and white photograph, and a local street map with directions. Interspersed throughout the book {{is a collection of}} color photographs ranging from a full page to a quarter page in size. Krekeler states that construction dates prior to 1850 are often questionable because of an absence of records and that these early sources would often contradict one another. Krekeler's bibliography cites an extensive collection of state maps, numerous local newspaper sources and works like World Guide to Covered Bridges by Richard Donovan. The information and sources used are cited {{at the end of each}} entry listing in the book, directly following the directions to the bridge. The book does not contain a typical index and instead favors a listing of bridges after the introduction of the state. The book was published in 1989 by Daring Books.|$|E
