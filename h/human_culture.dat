40|$|The {{question}} of whether a given trait qualifies as an adaptation must be answered on a case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, a strong case can be made for species as primarily adapted to their environments. A similar argument can be made for <b>human</b> <b>cultures</b> as primarily adapted to their environments at the group level. The reason that <b>human</b> <b>cultures</b> are primarily adaptive at the group level is because the capacity for culture is itself a group-level adaptation. Establishing a consensus on <b>human</b> <b>cultures</b> as primarily adapted at the group level will enable human cultural diversity to be studied {{in the same way as}} biological diversity...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to burying human remains, many <b>human</b> <b>cultures</b> also regularly bury animal remains.|$|R
5|$|Humans {{have long}} {{made use of}} deserts as places to live, and more {{recently}} have started to exploit them for minerals and energy capture. Deserts {{play a significant role}} in <b>human</b> <b>culture</b> with an extensive literature.|$|E
5|$|Mythological hybrids {{appear in}} <b>human</b> <b>culture</b> in forms {{as diverse as}} the Minotaur, blends of animals, humans and mythical beasts such as centaurs and sphinxes, and the Nephilim of the Biblical apocrypha {{described}} as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.|$|E
5|$|Being a key {{animal in}} the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in <b>human</b> <b>culture,</b> and find {{representation}} in much modern language and symbology. As livestock, sheep are most often associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery. Sheep figure in many mythologies—such as the Golden Fleece—and major religions, especially the Abrahamic traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.|$|E

50|$|Rewilding {{is about}} {{dismantling}} the <b>culture</b> of <b>human</b> domestication {{and returning to}} the lifeways of pre-agrarian <b>human</b> <b>cultures.</b> Though often associated with primitive skills and learning knowledge of wild plants and animals, it emphasizes regenerative land management techniques employed by hunter-gatherers and horticulturalists, as well as development of the senses and fostering deepening personal relationships with members of other species and the natural world. Rewilding intends to create permanently wild <b>human</b> <b>cultures</b> beyond domestication.|$|R
5|$|Birds {{have been}} a part of <b>human</b> <b>culture,</b> in the broad sense of social behaviour, customs and {{practices}} including but not limited to expressive forms such as art, music and religion, for thousands of years. Human society makes use of birds both economically, including for food, and non-economically, for sport, pleasure, and inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race, {{published}} in 2010, {{is a book}} written by Jon Stewart and other writers of The Daily Show and is similar in style to America (The Book), but focuses on planet and <b>human</b> <b>culture</b> instead {{of the history of}} America.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gregarious German cockroach, have an {{elaborate}} social structure involving common shelter, social dependence, information transfer and kin recognition. Cockroaches have appeared in <b>human</b> <b>culture</b> since classical antiquity. They are popularly depicted as dirty pests, though {{the great majority of}} species are inoffensive and live {{in a wide range of}} habitats around the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{invention}} of the Greek alphabet, as opposed to all previous systems, including the Phoenician, constituted an event {{in the history of}} <b>human</b> <b>culture,</b> the importance of which has not as yet been fully grasped. Its appearance divides all pre-Greek civilisations from those that are post-Greek.|$|E
5|$|Vegetable oils are {{triglycerides}} {{extracted from}} plants. Such as oils {{have been part}} of <b>human</b> <b>culture</b> for millennia. Edible vegetable oils are used in food, both in cooking and as supplements. Many oils, edible and otherwise, are burned as fuel, such as in oil lamps and as a substitute for petroleum-based fuels. Some of the many other uses include wood finishing, oil painting, and skin care.|$|E
5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound {{can be considered}} a {{musical instrument}}—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of <b>human</b> <b>culture.</b> Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E

5|$|Ariel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid princess, is {{dissatisfied}} with underwater {{life in the}} kingdom of Atlantica, and is curious about the human world. With her best friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts in her grotto, and often goes {{to the surface of the}} ocean to visit Scuttle, a seagull who offers very inaccurate knowledge of <b>human</b> <b>culture.</b> She ignores the warnings of her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden.|$|E
5|$|In <b>human</b> <b>culture,</b> domesticated mammals {{played a}} major role in the Neolithic revolution, causing farming to replace hunting and gathering, and leading to a major {{restructuring}} of human societies with the first civilizations. They provided, and continue to provide, power for transport and agriculture, as well as various commodities such as meat, dairy products, wool, and leather. Mammals are hunted or raced for sport, and are used as model organisms in science. Mammals have been depicted in art since Palaeolithic times, and appear in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Defaunation of mammals is primarily driven by anthropogenic factors, such as poaching and habitat destruction, though there are efforts to combat this.|$|E
5|$|Loss of wetland habitat threatens {{dragonfly}} populations {{around the}} world. Dragonflies {{are represented in}} <b>human</b> <b>culture</b> on artifacts such as pottery, rock paintings, and Art Nouveau jewellery. They are used in traditional medicine in Japan and China, and caught for food in Indonesia. They are symbols of courage, strength, and happiness in Japan, but seen as sinister in European folklore. Their bright colours and agile flight are admired in the poetry of Alfred, Lord Tennyson and the prose of H. E. Bates.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} birds are {{economically}} important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds (poultry and game) being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested {{for use as a}} fertiliser. Birds prominently figure throughout <b>human</b> <b>culture.</b> About 120–130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching {{is an important part of}} the ecotourism industry.|$|E
5|$|Microbes are {{important}} in <b>human</b> <b>culture</b> and health in many ways, serving to ferment foods, treat sewage, produce fuel, enzymes and other bioactive compounds. They are essential tools in biology as model organisms, and have been put to use in biological warfare and bioterrorism. They are a vital component of fertile soils. In the human body microorganisms make up the human microbiota including the essential gut flora. They are the pathogens responsible for many infectious diseases, and as such are the target of hygiene measures.|$|E
5|$|The Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii) {{is a large}} Australian predatory {{freshwater}} fish of the Maccullochella genus and the Percichthyidae family. Although the species is called a cod in the vernacular, it {{is not related to}} the Northern Hemisphere marine cod (Gadus) species. The Murray cod {{is an important part of}} Australia's vertebrate wildlife—as an apex predator in the Murray-Darling River system—and also significant in Australia's <b>human</b> <b>culture.</b> The Murray cod is the largest exclusively {{freshwater fish}} in Australia, and one of the largest in the world. Other common names for Murray cod include cod, greenfish, goodoo, Mary River cod, Murray perch, ponde, pondi and Queensland freshwater cod.|$|E
