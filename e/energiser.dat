50|$|The Dread Council became {{concerned}} {{at the lack}} of contact from Servitor Zom and contacted Vek to ask about Zoms whereabouts. Vek admitted he had killed Zom to protect the human race and that the judgement that humanity deserved to die was wrong. The Dread Council vowed that Vek would die for his crimes and they sent a trio of assassins, the Deathlords, to kill Vek. Their combined <b>energiser</b> rings proved too strong for his ring and it was destroyed and he was injured in the process but managed to escape {{in the form of a}} dog. However, as his condition worsened he was trapped in dog form, only managing to warp his head back to Noxian form. However, with the help of Mrs West and her son Nick, he was healed with a sunlamp. The Deathlords had set up a shield around Bradfield to stop Vek escaping and decided to use his love of humanity to lure him out. They sent hypnotic waves all over the town to force the people to walk into the shield which killed them. Vek went to the centre point of the shield and found the <b>energiser</b> ring which was producing it. A deathlord was waiting for him but Vek managed to reach the ring first by throwing bricks from a chimney at the deathlord, knocking him over and giving Vek enough time to use the ring to kill the deathlord and deactivate the shield. He then disappeared for a few months giving the deathlords no idea of how to find him (although there is no explanation as to why they couldnt track him through the <b>energiser).</b> However at a New Year party Vek was unable to maintain the human form he was in and the deathlords began the chase once again. This was the first time that teleportation was revealed as possible. The deathlords found him but Vek also managed to teleport and escape. Eventually they grew tired of the chase and decided to lure him out. They killed 104 humans on a motorway and then sent a message to Vek that the next day they would kill 10000 if he did not surrender. Vek realised that if they continued they would eventually destroy humanity by killing an ever increasing number of people, so he decided that he must face them. However he cleverly chose the battleground as Stonehenge. He was able to send an energy bolt ricochetting round the ancient stones which eventually struck a deathlord and killed him. The remaining deathlord attacked with an <b>energiser</b> beam that was stronger than the shield produced by Veks <b>energiser.</b> Realising he was doomed unless he acted, Vek teleported to hide behind a stone and immediately sent another bolt through the stone which killed the last remaining deathlord. He kept the deathlords ring as extra weaponry, fully aware that other assassins would be sent.Vek appeared on global television and explained the Noxian ethical code and the Deathlords, pointing out that now he was all that stood between humanity and execution, and how he had rebelled against Nox to protect them. This marked a turning-point in human attitude towards Doomlord; as he repeatedly protected Earth from various external threats, Vek became an ally of the British government through Cabinet minister Douglas Reeve, and even a respected and admired hero.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} few issues, Harvey pieced {{together}} what was happening - Doomlord {{had the power to}} murder people, and absorb their memories and personality by touch.

40|$|We {{present a}} family of {{simulation}} models of agents with energy from social interactions. We take the concept of “energy” from social network analysts Cross & Parker, from Collins’s micro-sociology of interaction rituals, and from the social psychologists Ryan & Deci’s studies on intrinsic motivation. We use simulation models as “tools for thinking” about what energy is, and how {{it relates to the}} take up of ideas, the formation of cultural groups and the performance of work. Our models also provide insight into phenomena from studies of “communities of practice”, social capital and computer models of networks. Baker & Quinn have also developed simulations of agents with energy, and so we offer a critique of those. We develop our models as extensions of the Axelrod Cultural Model. Our family of energy models include those that ascribe “emotional energy” variously to individual agents, to agents’ individual attributes, and to agents’ memories of interactions rituals. Agents obtain energy payoffs from interactions based variously on their sense of autonomy, belongingness and competence. We compare the behaviour of each model and choice of payoff function through experiments to test claims derived from Cross & Parker: namely that “energisers” cause greater take up of their ideas, cause larger cultural groups to form around them, and raise the problem-solving performance of the agent population. We demonstrate this first claim for several model scenarios, but fail to find scenarios where the second two hold. We then conduct experiments to relate the capabilities of <b>energisers</b> to tasks of: disseminating ideas to otherwise homogeneous groups, and; spanning boundaries across cultural divides between groups. In all experiments we find two factors play critical roles in determining the diffusion and homogenisation of culture: the decay of energy charges on memories, and; the initial number of cultural traits in the population.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, Durban, 2003. The {{impact of}} {{economic}} globalisation {{and the ensuing}} growth of world trade is presently {{the most important factor}} reshaping transport networks and port systems. As globalisation further develops, world trade and in particular sea borne trade will continue to grow. To cope with such an ever-growing world trade, ports will play a critical and indispensable role. Expanding trade volumes and shifting markets continue to challenge all elements of the logistics chain necessary for a seamless flow of goods from producer to consumer and pose particular challenges to seaports. The role of the transport sector in any modem economy is to generate a broad infrastructure and set of associated services that integrates diverse social and economic actors within and beyond the nation. Globalisation encompasses four particular phenomena, among others, that are especially relevant to South Africa's transport sector, given the role of transport as the key facilitator of international trade: • Falling tariff barriers to international trade. • Diminishing non-tariff barriers to trade. • Reintegration into the global economy. • Changes in the South African economy. These factors create very new and challenging circumstances for the transport sector and in particular the port systems. The functions of ports has evolved {{over the past few decades}} to be regarded as logistical platforms, by taking on the additional roles of facilitating value adding activities and the ranshipment of goods. Ports have thus become less of a compulsory point of change over from maritime transport to some other mode of transport and a strategic point in the organisation of foreign trade, a principle link in the integrated transport and economic chain. Essentially the theme underlying this study is a focus on the importance of ports as <b>energisers</b> of the economy and facilitating trade. The objective being to identify the different roles of ports and their structures in a changing world economy...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamical}} coupling {{between the}} solar chromospheric plasma and magnetic field is investigated by numerically solving a fully self-consistent, two-dimensional initial-value {{problem for the}} nonlinear collisional MHD equations including electric resistivity, thermal conduction, and, in some cases, gas-dynamic viscosity. The processes in the contact zone between two horizontal magnetic fields of opposite polarities are considered. The plasma {{is assumed to be}} initially motionless and having a temperature of 50, 000 K uniform throughout the plasma volume; the characteristic magnetic field corresponds to a plasma β≳ 1. In a physical-time interval of 17 seconds typically covered by a computational run, the plasma temperature gradually increases by a factor of two to three. Against this background, an impulsive (in 0. 1 seconds or less) increase in the current-aligned plasma velocity occurs {{at the site of the}} current-layer thinning (sausage-type deformation, or m= 0 pinch instability). Such a "velocity burst" can be interpreted physically as an event of suprathemal-proton generation. Further development of the sausage instability results in an increase in the kinetic temperature of the protons to high values, even to those observed in flares. The form of our system of MHD equations indicates that such increases are a property of the exact solution of the system at an appropriate choice of the parameters. Magnetic reconnection does not manifest itself in this solution: it would generate flows forbidden by the chosen geometry. Therefore, the pinch-sausage effect can act as an <b>energiser</b> of the upper chromosphere and be an alternative to the magnetic-reconnection process as the producer of flares.

40|$|Entwistle (2003) {{identified}} one of {{the outputs}} of the UK ETL research project as developing more precise {{ways of thinking about}} university teaching and learning. An important outcome of this research project has been the development of a set of concepts in respect of the quality of learning, particularly focusing on the pedagogical concepts of troublesome knowledge, threshold concepts and delayed understanding. Meyer and Land (2005) suggest that within each discipline, field or profession there are threshold concepts which integrate and define the scope of the academic community with which a student is engaging. These threshold concepts can be 'considered akin to passing through a portal, or conceptual gateway, thus opening up a new and previously inaccessible way of thinking about something' (Meyer and Land, 2003). Such concepts lead to a transformed way of understanding, or viewing something that may represent how people 'think' in a particular discipline, or how they perceive, apprehend or experience particular phenomena within a discipline. These concepts usually have five attributes: they are transformative, irreversible, integrative, bounded and troublesome. Threshold concepts have potential to encourage students towards deep rather than surface learning. The workshop will introduce some of the international current research on threshold concepts. It will focus on their application both as an analytical framework for understanding the student learning journey and for developing and evaluating curriculum and assessment in Higher Education. The workshop will be a forum for discussion with classroom practitioners and educational researchers on the potential for threshold concepts to be an enabler and <b>energiser</b> of open dialogue and inquiry into teaching and learning within and across traditional institution and disciplinary boundaries...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterium}} Burkholderia pseudomallei {{causes the}} disease melioidosis, a significant public health threat in endemic regions {{and is a}} potential biowarfare agent. Treatment of melioidosis is intensive and prolonged {{and there is no}} licensed vaccine to protect against it. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterise novel targets for antimicrobials to improve treatment of melioidosis. A holistic down selection process was undertaken in order to identify a range of possible novel and exploitable antimicrobial targets in Burkholderia pseudomallei. Four targets: FtsA, FtsZ, MraW and TonB were selected for characterisation by mutagenesis study. FtsA and FtsZ are early effectors of cell division and are considered potential antimicrobial drug targets in other pathogenic bacteria. Genes for both were shown likely to be essential for viability in Burkholderia pseudomallei, following attempted deletion of the genes, thus confirming their potential for drug targeting for treatment of melioidosis. MraW, a highly conserved methyltransferase, and TonB, the <b>energiser</b> for high affinity iron uptake in Gram negative bacteria, were also selected for characterisation as antimicrobial targets. In-frame deletions of the genes encoding these targets were constructed in B. pseudomallei K 96243. In order to determine the roles played by MraW and TonB during infection, these mutants were characterised in several models of Burkholderia pseudomallei infection. Deletion of mraW rendered the bacteria non-motile and led to attenuation during infection of Balb/C mice. A small growth defect was seen early during infection of macrophages by this mutant, whilst no attenuation was seen on deletion of mraW in Galleria mellonella. Burkholderia pseudomallei Î 9 ̆ 4 tonB required free iron supplementation for growth. This mutant had an improved ability to invade murine macrophages, though the mutant was attenuated in both Galleria mellonella and Balb/C mice. Attenuation of both mutants in a mammalian model of infection, support the strategy to target either of these proteins as novel targets for inhibition with small molecules during Burkholderia pseudomallei infection. However, an improved ability to infect macrophages by Burkholderia pseudomallei Î 9 ̆ 4 tonB and non-complementation of this mutant by iron supplementation to Galleria mellonella suggests additional roles to iron uptake alone for TonB in Burkholderia pseudomallei, such as bacterial iron sensing and signalling.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{uncertainty}} on professionals’ careers. Rapid socioeconomic changes in society, the labour market and organisations have resulted in increased instability and uncertainty in {{the environment in which}} people construct their career. Identifiable career paths can no longer be expected as organisational, occupational, and geographic boundaries become increasingly permeable. Moreover, as traditional objective markers of success such as pay and status decline in prominence, career success is increasingly defined by subjective measures, which themselves are uncertain. Professional careers are particularly uncertain. A wide variety of career structures are available to professionals, configurations in which they form and enact multiple identities, and the threat of knowledge obsolescence is ever-present. Despite the increased uncertainty in professional careers, uncertainty has not been systematically investigated. Traditional matching (Holland, 1959; Parsons, 1909) and developmental process career theories (Gottfredson, 1981; Super, 1984) retain a strong presence the field yet overlook {{the effect of}} uncertainty. Some contemporary career theories acknowledge uncertainty in, for example, the context within which careers are enacted (e. g. Arthur & Rousseau, 1996 c), in the process of constructing a career (e. g. Lent, 2005) or within an individual’s subjective career (e. g. Khapova, Arthur, & Wilderom, 2006). However, none problematise uncertainty, implicitly suggesting that it has the same meaning for all people. These shortcomings are addressed in this thesis by investigating how the meaning that people ascribe to uncertainty affects their career? The study used an interpretive research design and a narrative approach. Twenty in-depth interviews with professionals yielded rich data of people’s experiences of uncertainty in their career and the meaning that they ascribed to these uncertainties. The empirical results identified four distinct genres of career uncertainty: Stabiliser, Glider, <b>Energiser</b> and Adventurer. Each genre represents a distinct understanding of uncertainty – a shared meaning – that differs from personality traits or attitudes. Moreover, the variation of understanding of uncertainty affects career behaviour in distinctive ways, notably, in how people make career decisions, form and maintain a working identity, achieve career success and find meaning in work, structure their career, respond to job insecurity, display individual agency, and develop a clear self-concept. Together these behaviours led to the identification of an uncertainty based-framework for career theory that represents a continuum of understanding of uncertainty from negative to positive. The framework challenges the dominant logic of uncertainty in existing career theory in two important ways. First, the framework shows that uncertainty affects the behaviours through which people construct, enact and experience their career. The findings support and extend career theories that acknowledge the role of uncertainty in people’s career, while challenging the matching and developmental process theories that overlook uncertainty. Second, the uncertainty-based framework proposes that people have different understandings of uncertainty which affects their career behaviour in distinct ways. Thus, the contribution is a more nuanced understanding of the nature and role that uncertainty plays in career construction. Implications exist for people who confront uncertainty as well as the career counsellors who support them. The results also narrow the gap between theory and practice and suggest future research directions...|$|E
