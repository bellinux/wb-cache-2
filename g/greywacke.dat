5|$|The {{most common}} type of rock is <b>greywacke,</b> {{followed}} by other types of sandstones and shales. Landslides and mass wasting are common in this region due to erosion as well as earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Further {{sedimentary}} deposits {{were formed}} through the Cambrian period (541–485 Ma), some of which, {{along with the}} earlier Precambrian sediments, metamorphosed into the Dalradian series. This is composed {{of a wide variety}} of materials, including mica schist, biotite gneiss schist, schistose grit, <b>greywacke</b> and quartzite. The area that would become Scotland was at this time close to the south pole and part of Laurentia. Fossils from the north-west Highlands indicate the presence of trilobites and other primitive forms of life.|$|E
5|$|Silurian rocks {{form the}} Southern Uplands of Scotland, which were pushed {{up from the}} sea bed during the {{collision}} with Baltica/Avalonia. The majority of the rocks are weakly metamorphosed coarse <b>greywacke.</b> The Highlands were also affected by these collisions, creating a series of thrust faults in the northwest Highlands including the Moine Thrust, the understanding of which {{played an important role}} in 19th century geological thinking. Volcanic activity occurred across Scotland as a result of the collision of the tectonic plates, with volcanoes in southern Scotland, and magma chambers in the north, which today form the granite mountains such as the Cairngorms.|$|E

5|$|Egypt {{is rich in}} {{building}} and decorative stone, copper and lead ores, gold, and semiprecious stones. These natural resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and fashion jewelry. Embalmers used salts from the Wadi Natrun for mummification, which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster. Ore-bearing rock formations were found in distant, inhospitable wadis in the eastern desert and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive gold mines in Nubia, {{and one of the}} first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The Wadi Hammamat was a notable source of granite, <b>greywacke,</b> and gold. Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose. Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians worked {{deposits}} {{of the lead}} ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines. Copper {{was the most important}} metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai. Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period. High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry, <b>greywacke,</b> alabaster, and carnelian dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked {{deposits of}} emeralds in Wadi Sikait and amethyst in Wadi el-Hudi.|$|E

40|$|U-Pb {{detrital}} zircon ages {{from the}} Beiras Group <b>greywackes</b> (SW Central Iberian Zone - CIZ) indicate a maximum depositional age of late Ediacaran (c. 560 - 578 Ma). Two salient features distinguish the Beiras Group from the Série Negra <b>greywackes</b> (age equivalent from the Ossa-Morena Zone - OMZ) : i) The presence of Tonian and Mesoproterozoic (< 8 %) age clusters in the Beiras Group <b>greywackes,</b> {{that are almost}} absent in the OMZ, imply either a distinct or an additional source of detrital zircons from the West African Craton; and 2) The higher content of Cryogenian zircon ages of the Beiras Group <b>greywackes</b> (mainly at c. 840 - 750 Ma and c. 685 - 660 Ma), that contrast with the dominant Ediacaran zircon ages of the Série Negra <b>greywackes</b> (OMZ). The Cryogenian zircon forming events that are dominant in the SW CIZ basins are probably related to a different source with early Cadomian juvenile crust (c. 700 - 635 Ma) and with a possible contribution of the Pan-African suture (c. 850 - 700 Ma). The Nd isotopic signatures support {{the addition of a}} juvenile source to pre-existent older crust for the Beiras Group metasediments. Although the Beiras Group (SW CIZ) and Serie Negra (OMZ) late Ediacaran basins have evolved together in the active margin of Gondwana, they were sufficiently separated to account for the differences in their detrital zircon content and isotopic signatures...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Apetrographicana•y•is•fCambr•-•rd•vician•and-andsih-sized•reywackesfr•ms•uth-ea•t Ireland {{indicates}} {{that much of}} the matrix is secondary in origin. Detrital quartz, feldspar and rock fragments are observed to contribute to the matrix; the quartz by marginal corrosion and accompanying recrystallization, and the feldspar and rock fragments principally by sericitization. The coarser <b>greywackes</b> show an upward decrease in matrix content through the succession corresponding to an increase in demtal quartz, feldspar and rock fragment contents, and to a decrease in the quartz content of the matrix. Most of these trends, albeit more ill-defined, also occur in the invariably more matrix-rich fine-grained <b>greywackes.</b> In the light of the available evidence, these trends and the petrographic features of the <b>greywackes</b> are best explained as being due to diagenesis, influenced primarily by the substantial overburdening effects of the sediment pile. A subsequent phase of lowgrade regional metamorphism is thought o have had little effect on the diagenetic features...|$|R
5|$|As the greenstone belts were forming, volcanoes ejected tephra {{into the}} air which settled as sediments to become {{compacted}} into the <b>greywackes</b> and mudstones of the Knife Lake and Lake Vermilion formations. <b>Greywackes</b> are poorly sorted mixtures of clay, mica and quartz that may be derived from the decomposition of pyroclastic debris; {{the presence of this}} debris suggests that some explosive volcanic activity had occurred in the area earlier. The volcanism took place on the surface and the other deformations took place at various depths. Numerous earthquakes accompanied the volcanism and faulting.|$|R

25|$|Geologically the {{district}} is predominantly <b>greywacke</b> of Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous age, draped by wind-blown loess during the Pleistocene Ice Ages and more recently covered in volcanic ash and pumice from the Rotorua and Taupo volcanic centres. The active volcano Whakaari/White Island lies offshore and represents a tsunami risk. Earthquakes are also a risk, but {{the district}} lies just off {{to the east of}} major fault lines and the risk is less than in other nearby areas. There are no valuable mineral resources, although the <b>greywacke</b> contains rare decapitated guyots which have been mined in the past for gold and copper.|$|E
40|$|Analyses of {{a series}} of coexisting {{minerals}} and their host rocks, from the Aberfoyle area, indicate that previously proposed biotite-forming reactions are inadequate to account for the appearance of biotite in the Dalradian <b>greywackes</b> and pelites. Initially biotite is formed as a product of the breakdown of the assemblage chlorite+microcline+phengitic muscovite in <b>greywackes</b> of suitable bulk composition. With increase in grade the stability field of the biotite-bearing assemblage is enlarged through the reduction in the amount of celadonite substitution that can be tolerated by the white micas. The stability field increases so that it includes progressively more aluminous rocks. The sequence of biotite-forming reactions is used to define three zones of increasing meta-morphic grade in the Dalradian <b>greywackes</b> and pelites. The interrelationships of the assem-blages developed in these zones are considered in detail. The assemblages developed in the Green Beds are explained {{on the assumption that the}} fugacity of CO, is a third intensive variable...|$|R

25|$|Two {{physical}} components {{comprise the}} Bathurst region; the Bathurst Basin and the Tablelands areas.

The central basin area of the Bathurst area is mainly granite soils while in the north area sandstone, conglomerates, <b>greywacke,</b> siltstones, limestones and minor volcanos predominate. The south is more complex geology with siltstones, sandstones, <b>greywacke,</b> shales and chert, basalt and granite intrusions and embedded volcanic and limestones. Underlying Bathurst is the dominant feature of Bathurst granite (intruded in the Devonian period) and at Mount Panorama and Mount Stewart basalt occurs.|$|E
50|$|The Giessen nappe {{consists}} of a thin sequence of slightly metamorphosed Lower and Middle Devonian slates and radiolarites covered with Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous <b>greywackes.</b> At some spots along {{the base of the}} Giessen nappe alien tectonic slices of metabasalt occur.

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the turbiditic sediments from the Carboniferous Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group (BAFG) in the South Portuguese Zone, an {{external}} zone of the Iberian Variscides. The aim of this work is to constrain the provenance and tectonic setting of these sediments in a context of a complex evolution of SW Iberian Variscides. For this purpose, we performed a systematic study of petrographical and geochemical signatures of <b>greywackes</b> and shales from the three BAFG formations: Mértola, Mira and Brejeira. Major and trace element composition and ratios suggest heterogeneous source area composition for BAFG shales and <b>greywackes.</b> For the oldest Mértola Formation <b>greywackes,</b> source area is dominated by granitoid rocks with minor mafic input. The latter becomes residual in the Mira Formation. The youngest Brejeira Formation <b>greywackes</b> show clear felsic affiliation associated with an increase in recycled components. The shales of all three BAFG formations denote a granodioritic affiliation. Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) and Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA) values suggest moderate weathering in the source areas of Mértola and Mira formations. These indices, together with A–CN–K relations, point out to steady-state weathering conditions in the source areas of both formations. In contrast, both CIA and PIA values for the Brejeira Formation indicate variable conditions of palaeoweathering, from moderate to intense, as a consequence of non-steady-state conditions probably triggered by tectonic instability in the provenance area. Compared to the <b>greywackes,</b> the shales of all three BAFG formations exhibit higher CIA and PIA values, as well as low K 2 O/Al 2 O 3 (~ 0. 2) and index of compositional variability (b 1), reflecting the cumulative effect of multiple cycles of sedimentary recycling and prolonged chemical weathering history. Major and trace element distribution and upper continental crust-normalized multi-element plots suggest that the sediments of BAFG were derived mainly from a continental arc/active margin with minor contribution from old continental crust. Together, our geochemical data are compatible with BAFG sediments derived mainly from SW border of the Ossa Morena Zone (Gondwanan affinity), with possible contribution from an external (Avalonian) source...|$|R
