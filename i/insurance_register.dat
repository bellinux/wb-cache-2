40|$|Purpose: In Korea, {{the entire}} {{population}} must enroll in the national health insurance system, {{and those who are}} classified as having a lower socioeconomic status are supported by the medical aid system. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the association of the medi-cal insurance status of gastric cancer patients with their survival after gastrectomy. Materials and Methods: A total of 247 patients who underwent surgical treatment for gastric cancer between January 1999 and De-cember 2010 at the Seoul Medical Center were evaluated. Based on their medical insurance status, the patients were classified into two groups: the national health <b>insurance</b> <b>registered</b> group (n= 183), and the medical aid covered group (n= 64). The survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The median postoperative duration of hospitalization was longer in the medical aid covered group and postoperative morbidity and mortality were higher in the medical aid group than in the national health <b>insurance</b> <b>registered</b> group (P< 0. 05). The overall 5 -year survival rate was 43. 9 % in the medical aid covered group and 64. 3 % in the national health <b>insurance</b> <b>registered</b> group (P= 0. 001). Conclusions: The medical insurance status reflects the socioeconomic status of a patient and can influence the overall survival of gastric cancer patients.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} a nature-assisted rehabilitation programme in a group of patients with reactions to severe stress and/or mild to moderate depression. Changes in sick-leave status and healthcare consumption in these patients were compared with those in a matched population-based reference cohort (treatment as usual). Design: Retrospective cohort study with a matched reference group from the general population. Subjects: A total of 118 participants referred to a nature-assisted rehabilitation programme, and 678 controls recruited from the Skane Health Care Register. For both groups, information on sick leave was extracted from the National Social <b>Insurance</b> <b>Register</b> and on healthcare consumption data from the Skane Health Care Register. Methods: The interventional rehabilitation programme was designed as a multimodal programme involving professionals from horticulture and medicine. The programme was conducted in a rehabilitation garden, designed especially for this purpose. Results: A significant reduction in healthcare consumption was noted among participants in the programme compared with the reference population. The main changes were a reduction in outpatient visits to primary healthcare and a reduction in inpatient psychiatric care. No significant difference in sick-leave status was found. Conclusion: A structured, nature-based rehabilitation programme for patients with reactions to severe stress and/or depression could be beneficial, as reflected in reduced healthcare consumption...|$|E

40|$|Background Socioeconomic {{differences}} {{in health and}} in use of health care are well known. Most data on socioeconomic {{differences in}} health care utilization are based on retrospective self-report in community surveys, but the evidence on the validity of self-reported utilization of health care across socioeconomic groups is limited. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the validity of self-reported utilization of health care across socioeconomic, groups in the general population. Methods We compared the concordance of self-reported and registered hospitalization (one year, n = 1277), and utilization of physiotherapy (one year, n = 1302) and use of prescription drugs (3 months, n = 899), by socioeconomic group (educational level, income, occupational status). Data came from a face-to-face health interview survey in Amsterdam and a health <b>insurance</b> <b>register,</b> and were limited to native Dutch and lower and middle income groups. Results Concordance between reported and registered utilization was generally good to excellent; kappas (agreement adjusted for chance agreement) and percentage accurately reporting ranged from 0. 60 and 80 % (drugs) to 0. 80 and 96 % (hospitalization). They differed little, and without statistical significance, between people of low socioeconomic status and others. Assessment of socioeconomic groups in more detail yields somewhat more variation, but no systematic trend in concordance by higher socioeconomic status. Conclusion Self-report offers a reasonably valid estimate of differences in utilization of health care between socioeconomic groups in the general population, at least for lower and middle income groups...|$|E
40|$|Background. Surveys {{among the}} general {{population}} are an important method for collecting epidemiological data on health and utilization {{of health care in}} that population. Selective non-response may affect the validity of these data. This study examines the impact of response bias on estimates of health care utilization and on risk estimates for utilization in relation to demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, using administrative data on use of health care. Methods. Data on registered health care utilization were extracted from health <b>insurance</b> <b>register</b> and linked to respondents (2934; 62. 7 %) and non-respondents (1744) in a personal health interview survey among adult residents from the lower two-thirds income bracket in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Results. Estimates of registered healthcare utilization are higher if based on respondents only, than if they are based on the entire target sample. This goes for prescription drugs, specialist medical care, paramedical care, dental care and medical aids, but not for hospital care. Most risk estimates of registered utilization for background characterisitcs (gender, family composition, marital status, year of settlement, affluence of neighbourhood and ethnicity) differ only slightly and without statistical significance. If different, most estimates based on respondents only are somewhat higher. The largest differences are found for age (average overestimation of risks for age groups 35 - 64 and 65 + years compared to that of 16 - 34 years: 16 % and 17 %, respectively). Conclusions. In this study, response bias affects estimates of registered health care utilization but hardly affects risk estimates of utilization by background characteristics...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether job strain, psychological demands, and decision latitude are independent determinants of disability pension rates over a 12 -year follow-up period. METHODS: We studied 3, 181 men and 3, 359 women, all middle-aged and working at least 30 h per week, recruited from the general population of Malmö, Sweden, in 1992. The participation rate was 41 %. Baseline data include sociodemographics, the Job Content Questionnaire, lifestyle, and health-related variables. Disability pension information was obtained through record linkage from the National Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>Register.</b> RESULTS: Nearly 20 % of the women and 15 % of the men were granted a disability pension during the follow-up period. The highest quartile of psychological job demands and the lowest quartile of decision latitude were associated with disability pensions when controlling for age, socioeconomic position, and health risk behaviours. In the final model, with adjustment also for health indicators and stress from outside the workplace, the hazard ratios for high strain jobs (i. e. high psychological demands in combination with low decision latitude) were 1. 5 in men (95 % CI, 1. 04 - 2. 0) and 1. 7 in women (95 % CI, 1. 3 - 2. 2). Stratifying for health at baseline showed that high strain tended to affect healthy but not unhealthy men, while this pattern was reversed in women. CONCLUSIONS: High psychological demands, low decision latitude, and job strain were all confirmed as independent risk factors for subsequent disability pensions. In order to increase chances of individuals remaining in the work force, interventions against these adverse psychosocial factors appear worthwhile...|$|E

40|$|Background. Antibiotic {{utilisation}} varies profoundly among {{and within}} countries, {{and the extent}} of antibiotic utilisation correlates with the frequency of bacterial resistance, particularly among children. Hence, it is important to assess which factors may influence prescribing. In addition to variations in morbidity, health-care organisation, drug regulatory and supply systems, prescriber's attitudes, parents' behaviour, attitudes and socio-economic positions seem important. We compared socio-economic position (educational level of adults) and antibiotic utilisation in children in the municipalities within a Danish and a Swedish county which are geographically close, have similar social and economic development, and similar drug regulatory and supply systems. Methods. Data on antibiotic utilisation (1998), expressed in defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DDD/TID), were obtained from the Copenhagen County Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>register</b> and from the National Corporation of Swedish Pharmacies. Data on municipal educational levels were obtained from Statistics Denmark and Statistics Sweden. Results. The utilisation of antibiotics in 0 - to 6 -year-old children was higher in the Swedish than in the Danish county but varied between the municipalities within both the Swedish (9. 6 - 17. 7 DDD/TID) and the Danish (8. 0 - 12. 9 DDD/TID) counties. Most notably, utilisation rates correlated negatively with the education levels in the Danish (r=- 0. 539, P= 0. 021) but positively in the Swedish (r=+ 0. 390, P= 0. 025) municipalities. Conclusion. The observed variations in antibiotic prescribing may reflect different parental and/or prescriber attitudes towards use of antibiotics and they emphasise that antibiotic prescribing is influenced by factors other than the prevalence of bacterial infections. Relationships between socio-economic position (educational level) and drug utilisation should not be generalised from one area to another...|$|E
40|$|The {{costs of}} {{diagnosing}} and treating basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) {{are the highest}} of all cancers in Australia. However, information regarding incidence, multiplicity and risk are scarce as keratinocyte cancers (KCs) are not captured by most registries. To address these gaps, we initiated the QSKIN Study in 2010 recruiting 43, 794 Queensland residents from a population register (participation 24 %). Participants self-completed a baseline survey recording information on residential history, sun exposure, phenotype and medical and family history. We identified keratinocyte cancers through linkage to the national <b>insurance</b> <b>register,</b> confirming histopathology where possible. During {{the first three years}} of follow-up, 6936 (17 %) participants had at least one KC excised; 1626 (4 %) had 3 or more excisions. Of lesions with known histology, there were 9713 BCCs (in 4080 people) and 3505 SCCs (in 1782 people). We developed a tool to predict the risk of developing KC using backwards stepwise logistic regression models. The primary model retained terms for 10 items, including history of > 20 prior skin cancers excised (OR 8. 6), > 50 skin lesions destroyed (OR 3. 4), age > 70 years (OR 3. 5) and fair skin color (OR 1. 8). Discrimination was high (Area under ROC 0. 80, 95 %CI 0. 79 - 0. 81) and the model appeared well calibrated.

The incidence of DP due to RA has decreased over recent years, coinciding with earlier and more aggressive treatment with DMARDs and biologics. A similar declining incidence of DP was simultaneously seen in patients with all diagnoses in the general population. The decrease in DPs was, however, larger for RA and was evident even before introduction of biologics. In 1990, the proportion of DPs caused by RA was 1. 9 % out of total amount of DPs, decreasing to 1. 5 % in 2000 and to 1 % in 2009.

The decrease in DPs due to RA coincides with new treatment strategies as well as with decreasing levels of DPs in patients with all diagnoses.

The use of general practitioner care and the use of prescribed drugs was increased among people from Surinam, Turkey and Morocco as compared with the indigenous population. Compared with the indigenous group with corresponding health status, the use of all other more specialised services was relatively low among Turkish and Moroccan people. Among the Surinamese population, the use of more specialised care was highly similar to that found in the Dutch population after differences in need were controlled for. Among people from the Netherlands Antilles, we observed a relatively high use of hospital services in combination with underuse of general practitioner services. The lower socioeconomic status of immigrant groups explained most of the increased use of the general practitioner and prescribed drugs, but could not account for the lower use of the more specialised services.  CONCLUSIONS—The results indicate that the utilisation of more specialised health care is lower for immigrant groups in the Netherlands, particularly for Turkish and Moroccan people and to a lesser extent, people from the Netherlands Antilles. Although underuse of more specialised services is also present among the lower socioeconomic groups in the Netherlands, the analyses indicate that this only partly explains the lower utilisation of these services among immigrant groups.

40|$|Introduction - The {{small number}} of the {{population}} who make disproportionally greater use of health care are called frequent attenders (FAs). This group, or 3 - 5 % of the population, account for 15 - 25 % of all visits to general practitioners (GPs). They have, besides more chronic diseases, often a combination of medical, social and psychological problems. Is the high consulting frequency explained by FAs comprehension of and way of coping with illness or do they, due to an increased vulnerability, contract diseases more often? No consistent explanation for FAs high consulting frequency has yet been found. Aim - The overall aim of this thesis was to describe and explore the phenomenon of frequent attenders in primary health care from a biopsychosocial perspective with special focus on vulnerability. Material and methods Among 341 frequent attenders and 1 025 controls divided by age and sex, data about consultation rate, diagnoses, prescribed medicine, referrals and certificates of illness, were gathered from the medical records during one year. All consultations concerning injuries were evaluated regarding the medical appropriateness of consulting a doctor or not. A questionnaire battery comprising scales of socio-demographic variables, stressful life events, social support and sense of coherence (SOC) {{was sent to the}} participants. The influence of each variable on frequent attendance was then determined. Based on data covering a five-year period from the National Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>register</b> concerning sick leave and disability pension, the influence of each variable on long-term sick leave and disability pension was estimated. Results FAs morbidity in different age and sex groups was {{similar to that of the}} controls, but they had a higher consulting frequency for most medical problems. There was no difference concerning medically appropriate consultations for injuries between FAs and controls, although injuries were 7. 2 times more common among FAs. SOC had a significant influence on frequent attendance, while stressful life events and social support did not. FAs were found to be a high-risk group for long-term sick leave and disability pension and, here, stressful life events was the only predictive factor. Conclusions The age- and sex-specific morbidity of FAs is similar to the rest of the population but significantly increased. Although their consulting frequency was very high, FAs consultations were medically appropriate A weak SOC, which is supposed to indicate a reduced ability to handle stresses of life, distinguished FAs from controls and supported the finding that stressful life events predicted a bad prognosis regarding long-term sick leave and disability pension. The findings from this thesis all point in the same direction that FAs are a vulnerable group of patients...|$|E
40|$|In 2003 the Swedish {{parliament}} {{decided to}} incorporate maintenance {{support for the}} elderly {{within the framework of}} the state social insurance system. Maintenance support for the elderly entails that individuals who, due to too short a period of residence in Sweden, do not qualify themselves for a full guarantee pension and thus have the right to receive benefits after completion of an income test. A large proportion of these people previously received individually incometested social benefits. Maintenance support for the elderly and how it is perceived by the elderly is the focus of the study. The overall aim of the study is to gain knowledge about what it means for immigrants who moved in later life to be the subject of a transfer from a selective benefit system to one where more general principles apply. More specifically the aim concerns what it means for their possibilities for gaining access to social rights and what it means for their relationship with the Swedish welfare state. The study’s empirical material consists of two parts. The first part contains register data from the social services register of the National Board of Health and Social Welfare and the social <b>insurance</b> <b>register</b> of the Swedish Social Insurance Board. The second consists of interviews with eleven foreign-born elderly persons who previously received social benefits and now receive maintenance support for the elderly. The analysis of the register data indicates that one-fifth of the target group actually includes people born in Sweden while the rest are immigrants arriving in Sweden in later life. For most of those in this latter group the maintenance support is their only source of financial support while it is a supplement for the Swedish-born elderly recipients. The results show that of those, who previously received social benefits and where the maintenance support is their only source of financial support, about onefifth received a smaller amount of benefit after the reform. The interview study indicates the existence of a gap between what the respondents express as needs of more individual considerations both in terms of the contact with the administrating authority and the maintenance support’s monetary content and how the elderly perceive that these needs are provided for. In order to try to understand this gap the result was analysed by using a number of major theoretical concepts such as universalism, stigma and shame, and social citizenship, public identity and recognition. The conclusions of the study is that a comprehension of the gap can be found in the standardised design and administration of the maintenance support and in the socio-economic context that immigrants coming to Sweden in later life find themselves in...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{nature of}} {{symptoms}} {{and signs of}} sciatica, genetic factors, and efficacy of periradicular infiltration were studied in 160 nonoperated patients with unilateral sciatica of 3 to 28 weeks duration. Back and leg pain (100 -mm VAS), disability (Oswestry), and quality-of-life (NHP) were evaluated. ENMG and 1. 5 -T MRI were performed on every patient. Presence of the Trp 2 and Trp 3 alleles of collagen IX was determined from blood samples. After informed consent, patients were randomized for periradicular infiltration with either methylprednisolone-bupivacaine, or saline. The final follow-up assessment was 1 year after the intervention. Economic analysis was based on data gathered from the patients, medical records and the National <b>Insurance</b> <b>Register.</b> At baseline, symptoms of sciatica did not correlate {{with the type of}} displacement of the symptomatic disc in MRI, or the presence of the Trp 2 or Trp 3 alleles. In the case of the Trp 2 allele, there was a non-significant tendency for the presence of a radial tear at the L 4 – 5 level. A significant genotype-phenotype association was found for the Trp 3 allele: 15 of 34 (44 %) patients with the Trp 3 allele were positive for thoracolumbar Scheuermann's disease in MRI compared to 19 % for sciatic patients without the allele (p =  0. 003). Periradicular infiltration with methylprednisolone-bupivacaine produced a significant treatment effect compared to saline at 2 weeks for leg pain, straight leg raising, lumbar flexion and patient satisfaction. At 6 months, saline was superior to steroid in back and leg pain. By 1 year, 18 patients in the methylprednisolone group and 15 in the saline group had received surgical treatment. Subgroup analysis revealed that the short-term effect of the steroid treatment was most pronounced for contained herniations and symptomatic lesions situated at the L 4 – 5 (or L 3 – 4) disc level. Patients with a contained herniation were less likely to undergo back surgery when receiving the steroid treatment and they also had significantly fewer days on sick leave from 3 to 6 months. Counter-effectiveness was most pronounced for extrusions. The results indicate that disability among sciatic patients may be present even when MRI findings are minor; and vice versa, prominent MRI findings may not associate with any symptoms. However, MRI seems to be useful for identifying patients with the Trp 3 allele. On the basis of the treatment intervention results, periradicular infiltration with a combination of steroid and anaesthetic may be recommended for sciatica as it offers at least short-term pain relief. Furthermore, in the case of contained herniations the steroid injection is cost-effective and may also prevent surgery. However, this subgroup analysis calls for a verification study...|$|E
