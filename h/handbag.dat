5|$|The impasse {{is broken}} by the return of Miss Prism, whom Lady Bracknell {{recognises}} as the person who, twenty-eight years earlier, as a family nursemaid, had taken a baby boy {{for a walk in}} a perambulator (baby carriage) and never returned. Challenged, Miss Prism explains that she had absentmindedly put the manuscript of a novel she was writing in the perambulator, and the baby in a <b>handbag,</b> which she had left at Victoria Station. Jack produces the very same <b>handbag,</b> showing that he is the lost baby, the elder son of Lady Bracknell's late sister, and thus Algernon's elder brother. Having acquired such respectable relations, he is acceptable as a suitor for Gwendolen after all.|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the role}} of <b>handbags</b> in the everyday lives of women with dementia. Drawing on findings from an ESRC funded UK study ‘Dementia and Dress’, it shows how <b>handbags</b> are significant to supporting the identities of women with dementia as ‘biographical’ and ‘memory’ objects, {{both in terms of}} the bags themselves, and the objects they contain. This is particularly so during the transition to care homes, where previous aspects of identity and social roles may be lost. <b>Handbags</b> are also significant to making personal or private space within care settings. However, dementia can heighten women's ambivalent relationship to their <b>handbags,</b> which can become a source of anxiety as ‘lost objects’, or may be viewed as problematic or ‘unruly’. <b>Handbags</b> may also be adapted or discarded due to changing bodies, lifestyles and the progression of dementia...|$|R
50|$|During the 1940s, the {{rationing}} {{of textiles}} for World War II {{led to the}} manufacturing of <b>handbags</b> made in materials like raffia or crocheted from yarn. Some women crocheted their own small <b>handbags</b> from commercial patterns during this period.|$|R
5000|$|A {{distinction}} {{can also}} be made between soft-body <b>handbags</b> or frame <b>handbags,</b> where a metal frame supports the textile or leather of the bag. Frame bags often use a kissing lock closure, with two interlocking metal beads set {{on the top of}} the frame. Kissing locks were popular on <b>handbags</b> during the early- to mid-20th century, and remain popular with vintage collectors and in [...] "retro" [...] designs.

5|$|As Styles was {{examining}} the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn {{was approached by}} an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated; as she watched, the police car stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's <b>handbag.</b> She went on to state that she witnessed {{one of the men}} crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them. According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.|$|E
