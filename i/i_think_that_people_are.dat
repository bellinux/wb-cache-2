As far as I am myself concerned, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> {{a great deal}} too prudent about money, I believe I could live as a married man on a hundred a year, if I had no more; and as for London, I don't see why London should be more {{expensive}} than any other place. You can get {{exactly what you want}} in London, and make your halfpence go farther there than anywhere else." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the same}} day, Derek Fildebrandt {{came out as}} the first Wildrose MLA to openly support a merger with the PC Party when he told a radio station, [...] "Frankly, I've heard enough. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> pretty clear. They want a single {{conservative}} option to face against the NDP in the next election." ...|$|E
5000|$|The lyrics also {{refer to}} Butler's {{idea that it}} is {{impossible}} to completely hide one's secrets. [...] "A lot of people have idea that there are aspects of your life that are hidden or secret … But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> pretty much open book." [...] He adds that the song can be interpreted politically, as current political figures have been accused of acting with hidden motives.|$|E
5000|$|... "I've {{always thought}} that there shouldn't be any limit {{to the things that}} are well designed. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who {{consider}} <b>that</b> art should only be kept for art galleries and doesn't have a role in public life, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> too narrow." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "To {{speak the}} truth, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{ought to be}} upset, and if I had a paper I would upset them all the time; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> life is so {{important}} and, in its workings, so upsetting that nobody should be spared." [...] (Letter to Stephen Spender, December 1955.) ...|$|R
5000|$|... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{should have}} {{democratic}} {{control over the}} profits that they produce. It is not real democracy until you have that. And the plain and simple definition of communism is the people having democratic control over the profits that they create." [...] —Boots Riley ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{preparing}} for the film, Hathaway credits the work of Kate Winslet and Penélope Cruz, two actresses [...] "whose work she returned to a lot in preparation" [...] for Love and Other Drugs; she believes both have [...] "done nudity with {{a tremendous amount of}} sensitivity and dignity". She identified one of her favorite Cruz films, Abre Los Ojos, as work that helped her greatly for her role. Like Gyllenhaal, Hathaway had final cut over those scenes, using it to cut five seconds where she thought [...] "the camera lingered a little bit". Hathaway said that she did not believe her nudity in the film would put off socially conservative people who would otherwise see the film, saying [...] "just because nudity is such a contentious issue in America people believe that they automatically alienate the conservative parts of America by having nudity. But I give the American public more credit than that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> curious and people do love love stories. I think people might find it and like it, even though {{it is a little bit}} risky." ...|$|E
40|$|Extract] Over {{the past}} weeks I have {{facilitated}} three workshops for psychologists. I have a standard introduction these days which alerts participants that I {{am not going}} to teach cognitive behavioural techniques. It is not an apology but a conscious political statement to explicitly identify that therapy can be practised in more than one modality. Interestingly, the majority of participants nod and smile on hearing this introduction. Many later say what a relief it is to hear about something other than CBT. These days, it certainly seems that nearly every workshop is about CBT for one condition or another. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> starting to tire of the monoculture...|$|E

"Oh yes;--I am a Conservative because I {{was born}} one. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> in {{politics}} should remain {{as they are}} born,--unless they are very wise indeed. When men come to be statesmen {{and all that kind}} of thing, of course they can change backwards and forwards." ...|$|R
5000|$|Stephanopoulos was {{introduced}} to transcendental meditation by Jerry Seinfeld. Conducting an interview on Good Morning America, he said, “We’re all here because we all have something in common—we all practice Transcendental Meditation. … <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> don’t really understand {{exactly what it is}} and what a difference it has made in people’s lives.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{realistic}} {{approach to the}} series included the costume design for Oliver's vigilante persona, created by Colleen Atwood. According to Amell, {{it was important for}} the suit to be functional, and the best way that he knew for that was if he could put the costume on by himself: [...] "If I can put it on by myself, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> will buy it. And that was our idea. That's our world." ...|$|R

[...] "I {{sleep until}} about noon, and then I {{have the rest}} of the day, until seven o'clock, to myself. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who work at night can make a more satisfactory use of their own time than those who work in the daytime. In the summer I can take a trip on the river, or go somewhere out of town, every day, if I like." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked by}} Beck for his opinion on [...] "Muslim extremists", Ellison replied, [...] "They're {{criminal}}s. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who commit criminal acts {{should be treated}} like criminals, regardless of their faith." [...] Ellison has also said, [...] "Osama bin Laden no more represents Islam than Timothy McVeigh represented Christianity." [...] Asked about the incident later, Ellison dismissed it, saying, [...] "It's just shock TV. Some pundits {{think they have to}} ask the most outrageous questions." ...|$|R
2500|$|Governor General Michaëlle Jean {{stated that}} [...] "what is {{happening}} right now {{is part of the}} possibilities in our democratic system and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> can be reassured that, as I turn to what is happening, I am myself looking at my constitutional duties." [...] Jean was faced with three possible outcomes {{as a result of her}} planned meeting with the prime minister on December 4, 2008: dissolving parliament, proroguing parliament, or asking him to resign and inviting the opposition parties to form a government.|$|R
5000|$|When it {{came time}} to design the look of the costume for Oliver Queen's vigilante persona, the studio brought in Colleen Atwood to develop a {{realistic}} approach to the suit. According to Amell, it was important for the suit to be functional, and the best way that he knew for that was if he could put the costume on by himself: [...] "If I can put it on by myself, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> will buy it. And that was our idea. That's our world." ...|$|R
50|$|But, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{there are}} <b>people</b> who can handle it, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> for the <b>people</b> who can handle it, it's OK. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> there's {{anything}} wrong with it. <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> um, {{when it comes to}} the point where the pain of using the things are too great than the pain of not using them, then you have to stop.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the same}} context, {{there will be}} a council of the isles. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> some <b>people</b> are calling it IONA - the islands of the north Atlantic, from which England, by definition, will be excluded.|$|R

25|$|Wu Zhipu {{claims he}} can move 30 billion cubic metres; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> 30,000 people will die. Zeng Xisheng {{has said that}} he will move 20 billion cubic metres, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> 20,000 <b>people</b> will die. Weiqing only {{promises}} 600 million cubic metres, maybe nobody will die.|$|R
60|$|This was {{an extreme}} case, and perhaps such a venture might not always turn out so happily; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> might oftener trust {{themselves}} to Providence {{in these matters}} than they do. There is really an infinite variety of pleasant resorts of all kinds now, and one could quite safely {{leave it to the}} man in the ticket-office where one should go, and check one's baggage accordingly. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the chances of an agreeable summer would be as good in that way as in making a hard-and- fast choice of a certain place and sticking to it. My own experience is that in these things chance makes a very good choice for one, as it does in most non-moral things.|$|R
5000|$|At Ole Miss, Orgeron {{recorded}} {{only two}} wins against teams with winning records (the 2005 and 2007 Memphis teams, which both finished at 7-5)—the fewest among active SEC coaches at the time. Until the 2007 season, {{he enjoyed the}} public support of the University of Mississippi's chancellor Robert Khayat and other administrators with oversight of the football program, including athletic director Pete Boone. In a November 2006 article in The Clarion-Ledger, Khayat said of Orgeron and the poor win/loss record since he was hired (7-14, {{at the time of}} the interview), [...] "I think Coach Orgeron inherited a very difficult situation....I am 100 percent behind him, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> ought to understand that he has a big challenge." ...|$|R
500|$|Hill {{repeatedly}} tells a {{story from}} when she was 14 years old and bouldering in Joshua Tree: she succeeded on a route when a man came over and commented how surprised he was that she could do the route because even he could not. [...] "I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? Just because I was a small girl, was I {{not to be able}} to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then <b>that</b> other <b>people</b> had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> should just do whatever they can do or want to do. It shouldn't be a matter of if they're a man or a woman. It shouldn't be a matter of one's sex." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she {{answered}} simply, [...] "because I must. Oh! whatever we may hear about each other, {{we may be}} quite certain that we still love each other--because we must--and all your heaven and hell cannot make any difference, no, not if they were both to join forces and try their best. But {{that does not mean}} that necessarily we shall marry each other, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who love like that rarely do marry, because, you see, they would be too happy, which something is always trying to prevent. It may mean, however," [...] she added reflectively, [...] "that we shall not marry anybody else, though even that might happen in your case--not in mine. Always remember, Godfrey, that I shall never marry anybody else, not even if you took three wives one after the other." ...|$|R
5000|$|Anthony Curtis of the Las Vegas Advisor {{opined that}} while The Reserve had good bargain deals, it {{suffered}} from a bad location and a [...] "strange theme," [...] saying, [...] "The jungle theme was always dark and brooding, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> turned <b>people</b> off a bit." [...] The Reserve also faced competition from the nearby Sunset Station hotel and casino.|$|R
5000|$|... "I don’t {{think one}} song {{in a set}} of 11 can be such a scare for the fans, {{especially}} considering all the very heavy passages the album got already. The album was originally planned to be a 10-tracks album but then we decided that we wanted to give a try with an acoustic track that could leave space for a totally new experiment. Of course, an acoustic track can be something that deals with an hard sound and leaves an impact anyway so when I was writing it I just tried to imagine an acoustic experiment that could include both the usual vocal style of our more melodic passages and be influenced by both the rock and electronic elements that always characterized our sound. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> like the music as a whole and are not so narrow-minded to give too much importance to clichés or a defender attitude would like this experiment. It is not a song for the hardcore souls but since we already had a lot of tracks in the past with a very pop feeling <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it would not be such a big thing to accept for a large part of our romantic fans." ...|$|R
6000|$|Before dark, {{we had to}} go below, for {{the captain}} said he didn't want any of us to roll overboard, and, besides, the spray from the high waves made the deck very wet and unpleasant. None of us liked it below. There was no place to sit but in the long saloon, where the dining-tables were, and after supper we all sat there and read. Mr. Chipperton had a lot of novels, and we each took one. But it wasn't much fun. I couldn't get {{interested}} in my story,--at least, not in the beginning of it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who want to use up time when they are travelling ought to take what Rectus called a [...] "begun" [...] novel along with them. He had got on pretty well in his book while he was in Nassau, and so just took it up now and went right along.|$|R
5000|$|On Tuesday, June 13, 1939, Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny {{published}} {{a list of}} volunteers, adding that new names were added to it on daily basis. In several previous issues of the paper, other lists were published, with hundreds of names altogether. Among people presented in the June 13 issue are such names, as Tadeusz Gierat from Wola Duchacka, Krakow, who wrote: [...] "My life belongs to you, my homeland", or Emilia Konopnicka from Tarnopol, who wrote: [...] "My father died in the war, and my Polish honor tells me to apply". Bolesław Sobczyk from Gdynia wrote: [...] "At any given moment I am willing to give my life for Poland", while J.F. from Trembowla wrote: [...] "I am over 50 years old, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> like me are the best candidates". Among volunteers there also {{was a group of}} coal miners from Nowa Wieś in Polish Upper Silesia.|$|R

"Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was true. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{there was}} a great flood, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> some <b>people</b> did escape, and that they saved their beasts, just as we should try to save Nigger and the Monkstown cocks and hens if we were flooded out. Then they were able to start again when the waters went down, and they were {{naturally}} very grateful to God for their escape." ...|$|R
5000|$|Paisley caused further {{controversy}} in May 2007 when, {{in an interview}} with journalist Jason O'Toole in Hot Press magazine, he said that [...] "I am pretty repulsed by gay and lesbianism. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is wrong. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> those <b>people</b> harm themselves and - without caring about it - harm society. That doesn't mean to say that I hate them - I mean, I hate what they do." ...|$|R
5000|$|When Wright's {{comments}} were aired {{in the national}} media, Obama distanced himself from them, saying to Charles Gibson of ABC News, [...] "It's as if we took the five dumbest things that I've ever said or you've ever said in our lives and compressed them and put them out there — <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people's</b> reaction would, understandably, be upset." [...] At the same time, Obama stated that [...] "words that degrade individuals {{have no place in}} our public dialogue, whether it's on the campaign stump or in the pulpit. In sum, I reject outright the statements by Rev. Wright that are at issue." [...] Obama later added, [...] "Had the reverend not retired, and had he not acknowledged that what he had said had deeply offended people and were inappropriate and mischaracterized what I believe is the greatness of this country, for all its flaws, then I wouldn't have felt as comfortable staying at the church." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song is one {{of three}} tracks on Pet Sounds where Brian is the only Beach Boy performing. On the line [...] "Listen to my heart...beat", Brian stated: [...] "I felt very deeply about that line. One of the sweetest songs I ever sang. I have to say I'm proud of it. The innocence of youth in my voice, of being young and childlike. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> what <b>people</b> liked." ...|$|R
500|$|... "I {{will tell}} you now, first off, I'm Christian, and my career is {{evidence}} of God in my life, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> most <b>people</b> are already thinking that Gaga and the blasphemy and they're premeditating the approach and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they'll be very shocked {{to find out how}} huge and really groundbreaking the message is and how freeing the message is for all the right reasons. And it's really going to shock the world." ...|$|R
5000|$|Grace plays a {{prep school}} student who uses {{marijuana}} and introduces his girlfriend to freebasing in director Steven Soderbergh's 2000 film Traffic, {{as well as}} having uncredited cameos as himself in Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven and its 2004 sequel, Ocean's Twelve. [...] "The joke is that you're supposed to play the worst version of yourself and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> too many people are comfortable with that. I never thought for a second <b>that</b> <b>people</b> were really going to <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> what <b>I</b> was like. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> will know <b>that</b> I was faking it in those movies," [...] he told Flaunt magazine in 2007. He planned to cameo in Ocean's Thirteen; but, because of his role in Spider-Man 3, he had to abandon these plans. As Grace said, [...] "I was doing reshoots on Spider-Man 3. I was bummed. I actually talked to Steven Soderbergh about that {{and we had a}} thing and then I couldn’t do it." [...] He also appeared in director Mike Newell's 2003 film Mona Lisa Smile.|$|R
5000|$|To {{prepare for}} her role, Moretz took months of {{training}} in learning how to handle guns and to use butterfly knives and swords. Moretz stated that the shooting of the action scenes was arduous. Goldman said that the aspect of the film adaptation that excited her the most was adapting Hit-Girl's storyline to the film. [...] Millar said he expected the character to receive mostly negative reception, [...] "But the movie was so well made, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> were quietly charmed by her for the most part. The only really negative thing we saw came from Roger Ebert and others from his generation who were upset, but there were those especially here in the United Kingdom who went crazy for her". Millar added he and Vaughn [...] "were quite surprised about that. We were expecting the worst, <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{were going to say}} she was amoral and we turn were going to get killed for her. But it was much more of a case where people were positive about Hit-Girl even saying she was empowering female character".|$|R
5000|$|Czerny {{wrote an}} essay on the correct {{performing}} of the piano sonatas of Beethoven, [...] "On the Proper performance of all Beethoven's works for piano" [...] (1846). Johannes Brahms wrote about it to Clara Schumann in a letter of March 1878: [...] "I certainly think Czerny's large pianoforte course Op.500 is worthy of study, particularly in regard to what he says about Beethoven {{and the performance of}} his works, for he was a diligent and attentive pupil ... Czerny's fingering is particularly worthy for attention. In fact <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> today ought to have more respect for this excellent man" [...] In a letter written to Otto Jahn of 30 October 1852, Liszt wrote: [...] "In the twenties, when a great portion of Beethoven's creations was a kind of Sphinx, Czerny was playing Beethoven exclusively, with an understanding as excellent as his technique was efficient and effective; and, later on, he did not set himself up against some progress that had been made in technique, but contributed materially to it by his own teaching and works." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{realistic}} {{approach to the}} series included the costume design for Oliver's vigilante persona, created by Colleen Atwood.

After input from producer Greg Berlanti and Amell, Mani redesigned the costume to show off the character's biceps, and be more reflective of the comic book counterpart. According to Mani, [...] "I wanted it to be tactical, so the shoulders are a little tougher ... I also wanted him to be able to remove a layer or be in the layer and still be the Arrow, but not have the full fig on." ...|$|R
