5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} the ground by {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the <b>inflow</b> of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the <b>inflow</b> of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear <b>inflow</b> jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E
5|$|Severe thunderstorms, {{which can}} spawn tornadoes and hailstorms, require wind shear to {{organize}} the storm {{in such a way}} as to maintain the thunderstorm for a longer period of time. This occurs as the storm's <b>inflow</b> becomes separated from its rain-cooled outflow. An increasing nocturnal, or overnight, low level jet can increase the severe weather potential by increasing the vertical wind shear through the troposphere. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its <b>inflow</b> of relatively warm, moist air and kills the thunderstorm.|$|E

It appears that FDI <b>inflows</b> in manufacturing have rather weak effects on local employment and wages {{in most of the}} states in the sample. However, these results are primarily due to the industry composition of the FDI. FDI <b>inflows</b> in Printing and Publishing, Transportation Equipment and Instruments have positive effects on local employment and wages, while FDI <b>inflows</b> in Leather and Stone/Clay/Glass have detrimental effects on local labour markets in most of the states in the sample. These findings indicate the importance of industry characteristics in evaluating the effects of FDI <b>inflows</b> on local communities.

After the 2008 global {{economic}} crisis, {{as one of}} the emerging markets, Indonesia has experienced a lot of capital <b>inflows.</b> The increase in capital <b>inflows</b> has stimulated economic activities and caused macroec onomic fluctuations. This study focuses on the analysis of pull and push factors that affect the portfolio capital <b>inflows</b> to Indonesia. The study utilizes structural vector autoregressive (SVAR), impulse responses function (IRF), and variance decomposition (VD) methods.   The method of SVAR is used to analyze the shocks to factors relatively affecting the variation of incoming portfolio <b>inflows</b> (equity and bond <b>inflows)</b> to Indonesia, as well as the responses of the portfolio <b>inflows</b> to shocks to these factors. The findings indicate that SVAR approach can be employed in this study. The results of the impulse responses functions show that the portfolio <b>inflows</b> in the form of bonds generate positive response to the unexpected changes of budget deficit and domestic output growth, while the portfolio <b>inflows</b> in the form of stocks generate positive response to the unexpected changes in foreign output growth, domestic output growth, stock price index, and budget deficit. Furthermore, the results of variance decomposition analysis indicate that domestic interest rate and current account balance are the main determinants that explained the variation of portfolio <b>inflows</b> in the form of bonds, while the domestic interest rate and stock price index are the most dominant variables that explained the variation of portfolio <b>inflows</b> in the form of stocks.

I Use a sample of 11 African countries, and employ Fixed Effect and Arellano-Bond GMM estimators. The most important finding is that macroeconomic uncertainty (captured by conditional variances obtained from GARCH models) and the poor quality of host country institutions (proxied by corruption) are deterrents of FDI <b>inflows</b> into these economies. However, political risk (proxied by internal and external conflicts) does not significantly affect FDI <b>inflows</b> into Africa economies...|$|R

5|$|In the {{dissipation}} stage, the thunderstorm {{is dominated}} by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the <b>inflow</b> of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its <b>inflow</b> of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.|$|E
