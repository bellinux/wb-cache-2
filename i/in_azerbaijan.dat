He was particularly active in unifying the various semi-independent detachments active in the war zone. Political chaos <b>in</b> <b>Azerbaijan</b> and the demoralization of the Azerbaijani army resulted in the Armenian forces taking control over the territories outside of the original Soviet-drawn borders of Nagorno-Karabakh.

5|$|Following the 2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest, Armenian media {{claimed that}} Azerbaijan's {{broadcaster}} had {{cut off the}} broadcast when {{it became apparent that}} Armenia had won; however, it was disputed whether the contest was even broadcast <b>in</b> <b>Azerbaijan</b> as they had not yet participated. Accordingly, as Azerbaijan prepared to host the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest following its victory in 2011, a group of Armenian musicians led a boycott effort, and the country would ultimately withdraw from the contest, causing the broadcaster to be fined for the late notice. Armenia returned in the 2013 edition, which was held in Sweden. The move was criticized by an Azeri politician and a representative of the country's state broadcaster, who felt that Armenia's participation could have been a symbol of peace between the two nations, and that the decision would further damage the country's reputation.|$|E
5|$|Historically this {{is nothing}} new, as the tense {{relations}} between Armenia and Azerbaijan because of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict have been mirrored in chess over the years, resulting {{in the absence of}} players from one of the two countries at tournaments hosted in the other country and even relocation of chess events. For example, the candidates tournament for the World Chess Championship 2012 was ultimately moved (completely) from Baku to Kazan, with consideration given that one underlying reason was because Armenia's Levon Aronian was inhospitable toward playing <b>in</b> <b>Azerbaijan.</b> More recently, Azerbaijan chose not to play in the 2015 World Team Chess Championship in Tsaghkadzor, and Azerbaijani players did not participate in the European Individual Chess Championship 2014 in Yerevan. Nevertheless, Armenian players, including Levon Aronian, did play at the 2015 Chess World Cup in Baku, giving some hope the team would appear at the Olympiad.|$|E
