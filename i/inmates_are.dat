5|$|Wales {{is served}} by four {{regional}} police forces, Dyfed-Powys Police, Gwent Police, North Wales Police and South Wales Police. Four prisons are in Wales; all in the southern half of the country. Wales has no women's prisons; female <b>inmates</b> <b>are</b> imprisoned in England.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inmates</b> <b>are</b> {{allowed to}} receive their families, partners, or friends privately twice a week for two hours. Individual rooms {{containing}} a sofa, sink, and cupboard with sheets, towels, and condoms are available for single-person visits. For those with families, a larger room with toys and baby-changing facilities is available. <b>Inmates</b> <b>are</b> checked after visits, and if illegal items are found, prisoners can lose their rights to private visits. This right is denied to high risk criminals and visitors with histories of drug offenses. There is also a separated, chalet-style house where prisoners can receive visits from family members and stay with them for 24 hours. The house has a small kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room with a dining table, a sofa, and a television, {{as well as an}} outdoor play area with toys. Foreigners are not allowed and inmates have to complete a child-development education program to have 24-hour-long visits. During visits, staff make regular checks on the prisoners and their families.|$|E
5|$|An edited {{version of}} the musical cue from the Tar Sequence (where the <b>inmates</b> <b>are</b> energetically paving the road) {{has been used for}} years as the theme music for local {{television}} stations' news programs around the world, mostly those owned and operated by ABC in the United States. Although the music was written for the film, it became more familiar for its association with television news, in part because its staccato melody resembles the sound of a telegraph.|$|E
50|$|Holocaust {{survivor}} {{and author}} Moshe Ha-Elion recalls {{that when the}} camp was liberated, the Polish <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> singing the Polish hymn, the Greek <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> singing the Greek hymn and the French <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> singing La Marseillaise. After, the Jews <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> singing Ha Tikvah.|$|R
5000|$|Lack of {{personal}} possessions: <b>Inmates</b> <b>were</b> {{stripped of their}} belongings and personal attire. As inmates, only ragged prison-issue clothing was given to them. In winter, <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> given thin [...] "rain-coats" [...] and {{they were allowed to}} make light sandals. <b>Inmates</b> <b>were</b> given a personal food bowl, designed to contain [...] of [...] "soup" [...] they <b>were</b> fed with. <b>Inmates</b> whose bowl <b>was</b> missing (stolen by another inmate to defecate in) would receive no food. During delegation visits, <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> given bowls twice as large with spoons. At such times, <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> given colored tags.|$|R
50|$|On May 6, 1945, one {{day after}} Hitler's death, the American army liberated all the sub-camps of Mauthausen, {{including}} Ebensee, where Moshe Ha-Elion was a prisoner. Three American tanks entered in Ebensee. Some prisoners were touching them {{to be sure that}} they <b>were</b> real. Some <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> crying, some were shouting. Moshe Ha-Elion recalls that the Polish <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> singing the Polish hymn, the Greek <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> singing the Greek hymn and the French <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> singing La Marseillaise. After, the Jews <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> singing Ha Tikvah.|$|R
5|$|Chlomo {{missed his}} freedom by three months. The Soviets had liberated Auschwitz 11 days earlier, and the Americans were {{making their way}} towards Buchenwald. Eliezer is {{transferred}} to the children's block where he stays with 600 others, dreaming of soup. On 5 April 1945 the <b>inmates</b> <b>are</b> told the camp is to be liquidated and {{they are to be}} moved—another death march. On 11 April, with 20,000 inmates still inside, a resistance movement inside the camp attacks the remaining SS officers and takes control. At six o'clock that evening, an American tank arrives at the gates, and behind it the Sixth Armored Division of the United States Third Army.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} {{approximately}} 50 <b>inmates</b> <b>are</b> still buried there. During the cemetery’s early years, records were not carefully taken or preserved, and are unreliable.

50|$|Around 3,000 Jewish <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> {{deported}} from Tenje to Auschwitz and Jasenovac. The first {{departure of}} 1,700 <b>inmates</b> <b>was</b> organized on 14 August 1942, second on 18 August and remaining <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> deported {{at the end}} of August, some of them first to Lobor concentration camp and then to Auschwitz.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1995, female <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> {{gradually}} {{transferred to}} other federal correctional institutions. On May 8, 2000, the last female <b>inmate</b> <b>was</b> transferred {{away from the}} P4W.|$|R

50|$|There {{was a time}} at the Bridgewater State Hospital {{when many}} of the <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> there long after their {{sentence}} date. In 1968 over 250 cases were reviewed of forgotten men at Bridgewater. There <b>were</b> <b>inmates</b> that <b>were</b> at Bridgewater for over twenty-five years. Some <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> transferred to Bridgewater from other jails and prison facilities and kept at Bridgewater for much longer than their sentences entailed.|$|R
500|$|The nearest pit to {{the camp}} was the Šaran pit, located [...] away, while the pit where <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> {{executed}} and dumped was [...] from the camp. Here, <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> bound together in a line and the first few victims were murdered with rifle butts or other objects. Afterwards, an entire row of <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> pushed into the ravine. In some cases, <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> also killed by gunfire, {{as well as with}} knives and blunt objects. Once <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> thrown into the ravine, hand grenades were hurtled inside in order to kill off the victims. Dogs would also be thrown in to feed on the wounded and the dead. The pits {{in the vicinity of the}} camp were filled with the bodies of Jewish and later Serb <b>inmates.</b> However, killings <b>were</b> not confined to these two groups, and the bodies of some Croats and Roma were disposed of in this fashion as well.|$|R

25|$|Housing the {{approximately}} 500,000 {{people in jail}} in the US awaiting trial who cannot afford bail costs $9billion a year. Most jail <b>inmates</b> <b>are</b> petty, nonviolent offenders. Twenty years ago most nonviolent defendants were released on their own recognizance (trusted {{to show up at}} trial). Now most are given bail, and most pay a bail bondsman to afford it. 62% of local jail <b>inmates</b> <b>are</b> awaiting trial.|$|E

50|$|Several homicides have {{occurred}} since operations began. On February 10, 2013, an <b>inmate</b> <b>was</b> {{found dead in}} his cell in what was described as an apparent homicide. An inmate’s death in January at a Baltimore hospital was ruled a homicide. The <b>inmate</b> had <b>been</b> assaulted by another inmate at NBCI the previous November. An <b>inmate</b> <b>was</b> found dead in his cell on September 27, 2012, after an apparent strangulation. This led to the indictment of his cellmate on murder charges in January 2013. On December 8, 2011, an <b>inmate</b> <b>was</b> found unresponsive in his cell. His death was ruled a homicide by strangulation.|$|R
50|$|However, {{these numbers}} differ from monthly reports from Halle {{filed by the}} SS {{administration}} of the camp. According to a monthly reports dated August 13/14, 1944, the Siebel-Halle camp had 525 inmates. From September 1 to 20, 1944, one thousand <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> transferred to Siebel-Halle from Buchenwald (five hundred on September 2, five hundred on September 12). On September 27, an additional transport of twenty <b>inmates</b> <b>was</b> sent to Halle. Beginning in January 1945, <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> transferred from Halle to the Buchenwald subcamp in Annaburg. Ninety-seven <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> transferred to Annaburg in December 1944. Between January 1 and 31, 1945, there {{appear to have been}} no transports to Halle from Buchenwald, and on February 2, seven <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> transferred to Halle, with an additional five on March 23, 1945. Another report from March 25, 1945 shows that on January 1, 1945, Siebel-Halle had 633 inmates and on March 6, 1945, it had 528 inmates.|$|R

Thirteen of these boys were convicted and sentenced to various terms in the House of Correction.|$|R
5000|$|Other <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> killed using {{poisonous}} gas.

40|$|The authors, {{working in}} a maximum {{security}} correctional institution, had noted an apparent increase in acts of aggression by inmates when these <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> on psychotropic drugs. A retrospective study was therefore carried out to attempt to correlete and prove or disprove this hypothesis. It was found that violent, aggressive incidents occurred significantly more frequently in <b>Inmates</b> who <b>were</b> on psychotropic medication than when these <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> not on psychotropic drugs. Of these, antianxiety agents (diazepam in 81 percent of the cases), appeared to be most implicated, with 3. 6 times as many acts of aggression occurring when <b>inmates</b> <b>were</b> on these drugs. For the other classes of psychotropic medication the aggressive incident rate was double the rate of those on no psychotropic medication...|$|R
