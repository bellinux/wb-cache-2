40|$|The phase {{selection}} {{is an important}} of a SAT Solver based on conflict-driven DPLL. This paper presents a new phase selection strategy, in which the weight of each literal {{is defined as the}} sum of its implied-literals static weights. The implied literals of each literal is computed dynamically during the search. Therefore, it is call a <b>dynamic</b> phase <b>selection</b> strategy. In general, computing dynamically a weight is time-consuming. Hence, so far no SAT solver applies successfully a <b>dynamic</b> phase <b>selection.</b> Since the implied literal of our strategy conforms to that of the search process, the usual two watched-literals scheme can be applied here. Thus, the cost of our <b>dynamic</b> phase <b>selection</b> is very low. To improve Glucose 2. 0 which won a Gold Medal for application category at SAT 2011 competition, we build five phase selection schemes using the <b>dynamic</b> phase <b>selection</b> policy.

40|$|Abstract. Not {{long after}} the {{introduction}} of evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) concept, it was noticed that <b>dynamic</b> <b>selection</b> did not always lead {{to the establishment of}} the ESS. The concept of continuously stable strategy (CSS) was thereafter developed. It was generally accepted that <b>dynamic</b> <b>selection</b> leads to the establishment of an ESS if it is a CSS. Examination of an evolutionary stability concept which is called neighborhood invader strategy (NIS) shows that it may be im-possible for an ESS to be established through <b>dynamic</b> <b>selection</b> even if it is a CSS and no polymorphisms occur. We will examine the NIS concept and its implications for two evolutionary game models: root-shoot allocation in plant competition and Lotka–Volterra competition. In the root-shoot model we show that an ESS will be attained through <b>dynamic</b> <b>selection</b> if it is a NIS. Similarly for the Lotka–Volterra model, we show that an ESS will be attained through <b>dynamic</b> <b>selection</b> even if protected dimorphisms occur during the evolutionary process if it is an NIS.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an idea flows {{theory of}} trade and growth with heterogeneous firms. Entrants learn from incumbent firms and the diffusion technology is such that learning depends not on the frontier technology, but on the entire distribution of productivity. By shifting the productivity distribution upwards, selection causes technology diffusion and in equilibrium this <b>dynamic</b> <b>selection</b> process leads to endogenous growth without scale effects. On the balanced growth path, the productivity distribution is a traveling wave with a lower bound that increases over time. The free entry condition implies trade liberalization must increase the <b>dynamic</b> <b>selection</b> rate to offset the profits from new export opportunities. Consequently, trade integration raises long-run growth. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>selection</b> is {{a new source of}} gains from trade not found when firms are homogeneous.
