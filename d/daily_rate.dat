5|$|It {{appears that}} during the 18thcentury copper boom, it was {{customary}} throughout the Cornish mining industry to use bal maidens purely as casual labour. There are no records of bal maidens being contracted to a particular mine or paid a piece-rate {{for the amount of}} work done. Instead, mine accounts invariably show them being paid a fixed <b>daily</b> <b>rate</b> and employed only as and when they were needed. When poor weather conditions made surface-level work impossible, water shortages meant water-powered machinery could not operate, or accidents in the mines caused a temporary closure, the bal maidens would be suspended.|$|E

500|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} any charter party is the freight rate, or the price {{specified}} for carriage of cargo. [...] The freight rate of a tanker charter party is specified in one of four ways: by a lump sum rate, by rate per ton, by a time charter equivalent rate, or by Worldscale rate. In a lump sum rate arrangement, a fixed price is negotiated for the delivery of a specified cargo, and the ship's owner/operator is responsible {{to pay for all}} port costs and other voyage expenses. [...] Rate per ton arrangements are used mostly in chemical tanker chartering, and differ from lump sum rates in that port costs and voyage expenses are generally paid by the charterer. Time charter arrangements specify a <b>daily</b> <b>rate,</b> and port costs and voyage expenses are also generally paid by the charterer.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{variable}} daylength and temperature on net rates of photosynthesis, dark respiration, and excretion of a unicellular marine haptophyte, Isochrysis galbana Parke, were examined {{and related to}} division rates. Six combinations of daylength (18 : 6, 12 : 12, 6 : 18 light:dark, LD) and temperature (20, 25 C) were used. <b>Daily</b> <b>rates</b> of net photosynthesis were closely correlated to division rates, suggesting a direct relationship, and were maximal when cells were grown at 12 : 12 LD at both temperatures and 18 : 6 LD at 20 C. A daylength of 6 hours decreased <b>daily</b> <b>rates</b> by decreasing the time for carbon uptake. Further, cells grown with this daylength had maximal chlorophyll a contents, suggesting a physiological adaptation by photosynthetic units to short light periods. A photoperiod of 18 : 6 LD at 25 C decreased <b>daily</b> <b>rates</b> of net photosynthesis by reducing the hourly rate of net photosynthesis via an unidentified mechanism. The importance of rates of net dark respiration in controlling daily net photosynthesis was small, with carbon lost during dark periods varying between 4 and 14 % of that gained during light periods. Also, the influence of net excretion was small, varying between 1. 0 and 5. 5 % of daily net photosynthesis...|$|R
