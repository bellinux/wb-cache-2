50|$|Physical therapy (Physiotherapy) is {{a branch}} of medical science and an {{essential}} segment of modern health care system. It is a “science of healing and art of caring”. It pertains to the clinical examination, <b>evaluation,</b> <b>assessment,</b> {{diagnosis and treatment of}} so many disorders which covers 24 specialties of medicine out of 27. According to American Board of Physical Therapy Specialist there are some major areas of Physical therapy as Musculoskeletal (Orthopaedic), Neurology, Cardiopulmonary, Sports Physical Therapy, Pediatric Physiotherapy, Electrophysiology, Integumentary Physical Therapy, Hydrotherapy and Women’s Health. Physical Therapy is the most flourishing discipline that cultivates at the cross road of new trends in Rehabilitation Science. It is an independent health care profession concerned with identifying & maximizing quality of life & movement potential within the spheres of promotion, prevention, treatment & rehabilitation specialty which has physical means of treating patients suffering from different diseases. Though the field is as old as human is; physical therapy was practiced in 460B.C & {{it was the first time}} in 1894 in the history of England when a regulatory body under the name of “Chartered Society of Physiotherapy” was formed and it got its recognition in New Zealand in 1913 & then by USA in 1914. In Pakistan to cure Physical ailments, The First School regarding Physical Therapy Education was established in 1956 by the Federal Government, Ministry of Health & Social Welfare with the assistance of World Health Organization (WHO) at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center Karachi. Initially, the school offered a 2 years Diploma course with the minimum entrance qualification of matriculation (science group). In 1961, the 2 years program was upgraded to a 3 years Diploma. Later on, the program was raised to BSc Physiotherapy Degree (3 years) in 1963 after FSc Pre-Medical, affiliated with the University of Karachi, and pertinent changes were added & made in the syllabus according to the need. In Punjab, The School of Physiotherapy, Mayo Hospital, Lahore was established in 1985 for Physical Therapy education. When International faculties of Physiotherapy had upgraded their syllabi, In order to match those standards; in 1999, BSc Physiotherapy course was upgraded to 4 years BS Physiotherapy Degree Course. Recently, following the “Vision 2020 of American Physical Therapy Association”, the 4 years BSPT Program was upgraded to 5 years DPT (Doctor of Physiotherapy) Program in 2008 to meet the International standard. Pakistan the 3rd country in the world which is offering Doctor of Physical Therapy Course. In past, until 2007, there were only seven to eight institutions those offer physiotherapy education but now at present, more than 60 Institutions of Pakistan offering this education under the umbrella of different universities. There is only one association in Pakistan under the name of Pakistan Physical Therapy Association which is affiliated with World Confederation Physical Therapy but at government level there is no statuary regulatory and registration authority (Pakistan Physical Therapy Council) for Physical therapy education and for physical therapy Practitioners of Pakistan. The question arises why is there need of council for physical therapy? The answer is very simple. The council will provide guiding principles for use in every day practice for Physical Therapy professionals in their roles in regard to patients, students, community, colleagues, researchers and Pakistani citizens. The Code of Ethics of this council will be a public document which will endeavors to educate its members and the public on professional ethics. It will plan for the welfare and protection of the individuals and societies. It will state the responsibility of Physical therapy professionals to society and individuals; and the rights of an individual. It will serve for professionals and public interest. This regulatory body will also register all physiotherapy professionals and educational institutions all over the Pakistan. In Pakistan, Doctors, Pharmacists, Vet. Doctors, Homeopathics, Hakims (Tibb) and Nurses all have their statuary regulatory authorities under the manes of Pakistan Medical & Dental Council, Pakistan Pharmacy Council, Pakistan Veterinary Medical Council, National Council for Homeopathic, National Council for Tibb and Pakistan Nursing Council respectively. Then why there is no council for Physical Therapists who gain education from under graduation (DPT) to post graduation (PhD) in Pakistan. Due to the absence of a regulatory body, it had negatively impacted the quality of education at institutions and quackery was also on the rise and the “Technicians, who have only worked for a few weeks with a qualified physiotherapist, open their own clinics and start treating patients. Around two years back our professionals prepared a draft law for the establishment of Physiotherapy Council and submitted it to the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) but in vain. Due to lack of structure and regulatory authority, after graduation most of our professional leave the country and Pakistan is facing shortage of skilled professionals like other disciplines. The Higher Education Commission of Pakistan (HEC) regulates physical therapy education in Pakistan. All the members of the HEC and the National Curriculum and Revision Committee (NCRC) played a significant role in approving unanimous curriculum for entry level physical therapy education throughout the country. A mature entry level degree was introduced and recognised by the HEC resulting to the autonomous status of the profession in the country.8 DPT curriculum as approved by the HEC consists of 10 semesters of at least 175 credit hours. In Pakistan, DPT and PP-DPT were initiated in 2008 and the institutions offering these courses have increased rapidly in number. However, due to the absence of a regulatory body, this rapid growth has not been regulated and monitored. The HEC or the WCPT can propose guidelines regarding curriculum and physical therapy practice but those guidelines can be implemented and ensured by a regulatory body, which unfortunately does not exist. The faculty for different physical therapy programmes is usually blended containing local and international professionals from medical, allied and social sciences for their respective subjects. In Pakistan there are 69 Institutions offering DPT, 12 are offering t-DPT/PP-DPT, 12 universities are offering MSPT/M.Phil in Physiotherapy and 2 Universities offering PhD in Physiotherapy. Physiotherapists have a good scope in government and private hospitals and they are awarded 17 grade pay scale on entry level. In this way Pakistan has become the third country offering DPT in the world.|$|E
40|$|Managing {{information}} in engineering organizations {{is facing the}} particular issue of the ever-increasing volume of information. It has been recognized that an effective methodology is required to evaluate {{information in}} order to avoid information overload and to retain the right information for reuse. By using, as a starting point, a number of the current tools and techniques which attempt to evaluate ‘the value’ of information, it is proposed that an assessment or filter mechanism for information can be developed. This paper addresses this issue firstly by briefly reviewing the information overload problem, the definition of value, and related research work on the value of information in various areas. Then a “characteristic” based framework of information evaluation is introduced using the key characteristics identified from related work as an example. In order to quantitatively calculate the quality and value of information, a Bayesian Network diagram method is introduced to the framework to form an <b>evaluation</b> <b>assessment</b> model. Furthermore a decision supported method, with an assorted scoring system is also developed as the basis of the <b>evaluation</b> <b>assessment</b> result. Finally the additional benefits, especially the reversible reasoning inference process are discussed along with the issues of the challenge of the framework and the implementation of <b>evaluation</b> <b>assessment</b> method...|$|E
