40|$|We {{develop a}} three body {{classical}} trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) method to <b>dicsuss</b> {{the effect of}} the breakup process on heavy-ion fusion reactions induced by weakly bound nuclei. This method follows the classical trajectories of breakup fragments after the breakup takes place, and thus provides an unambiguous separation between complete and incomplete fusion cross sections. Applying this method to the fusion reaction $^{ 6 }$Li + $^{ 209 }$Bi, we find that there is a significant contribution to the total complete fusion cross sections from the process where all the breakup fragments are captured by the target nucleus (i. e., the breakup followed by complete fusion) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNowadays, social {{networking}} site (SNS) {{is one of the}} fastest growing Internet use. It is also one of social media platforms that encouraged social interaction in a virtual environment. Even several studies have focused on the motives behind the usage of SNS, less study has been conducted locally. Some studies exist, but their conclusions are still insufficient and sometimes even inconsistent. Hence, this conceptual paper attempt to <b>dicsuss</b> several factors of motivations using SNS towards the quality of work life which include i) interpersonal relationship and ii) personal health and well-being of the staff. It is expected that the discussion of this proposed study will assist to identify the critical motives of using SNS that lead to better quality of work life. In short, this study will provide significant contribution not only to the employees but also to the designers, developers, researchers, organization and society...|$|E

40|$|The master´s thesis {{deals with}} the design of {{two-stroke}} uniflow scavenged motorcycle engine according to patent František Pudil (PV 7018 - 80) 216305. The engine has been designed for using in off-road sport motorcycles. The objective of this thesis is to design the engine of this conception and to reveal benefits and defects of this concept by using this method. In this thesis the emphasis is put on design of the construction groups which {{are directly related to}} unconventional concept of engine. On the other hand, the parts which can be designed conventionally were solved marginally or were not solved at all.

40|$|We {{review the}} {{pollination}} ecology of acacias worldwide, <b>dicsussing</b> (1) the rewards provided to flower visitors, (2) the temporal patterns of flowering and reward provision and (3) the taxonomic composition of flower visitor assemblages. The flowers of most acacias (including {{all members of}} the subgenus Phyllodinae) offer only pollen to flower visitors and floral nectar is limited to a minority of species in the subgenera Acacia and Aculeiferum. The most important pollinators of acacias are social and solitary bees, although other insects and nectar-feeding birds are important in specific cases. Acacias that secrete nectar attract far more species-rich assemblages of flower-visitors, although many of these are probably not important as pollinators. Most acacias in the subgenus Phyllodinae have long-lived protogynous flowers, without clear daily patterns in reward provision and visitation. In contrast, most members of the other two subgenera have flowers that last for a single day, appear to be protandrous and have clear daily patterning in reward provision and visitation. The generality of these patterns should not be assumed until the pollination ecology of many more phyllodinous acacias has been studied, particularly in arid environments. The accessibility of the floral rewards in acacia flowers makes them important examples of two general issues in plant communities - the partitioning of shared pollinators and the evolution of floral ant repellents...|$|R
40|$|We present {{observations}} of OY Car, obtained with the Anglo-Australian telescope, during a normal outburst in 1991. Two sinusoidal components are {{resolved in the}} Hbeta trailed spectra and we determine {{the location of the}} narrow component to be on the secondary star with a maximum contributed flux of ~ 2. 5 per cent to the total flux. Imaging of the line distribution reveals that the other emission component is associated with the gas stream. This follows a velocity close to the ballistic one from the red star to a distance of ~ 0. 5 R_L 1 from the white dwarf. Then. its kinematics changes from 0. 5 - 0. 2 R_L 1 (accretion disc) following velocities now closer to (but lower than) the keplerian velocities along the path of the gas stream. We finally <b>dicsuss</b> the implications of having observed simultaneously line emission from the gas stream and the red star during outburst.

This {{is followed by a}} discussion of the structure functions of proton/nuclear targets as measured in the deep inelastic scattering (DIS) of leptons off these targets. We discuss the parton model in DIS as well as outline the usage of parton model in processes other than the DIS. We then go on to <b>dicsuss</b> the EMC effect: the nuclear dependence of the structure functions. After a discussion of different models of the EMC effect we end by pointing out the possibility of distinguishing between these different models by studying the correlation between the $A$ [...] dependence of different hard processes and the EMC effect.

40|$|Data-driven Web services, viewed broadly as {{interactive}} systems {{available on}} the Web for users and programs, provide the backbone for increasingly complex Web applications. While this yields everincreasing functionality, the added complexity renders such applications more vulnerable to bugs and failures, potentially compromising their robustness and correctness. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop verification techniques for such Web services. The WAVE project at UC San Diego aims to develop new approaches for automatic verification of data-driven Web services. The work relies on a novel, highly effective marriage of model checking and database techniques. We summarize briefly the main contributions of the project, which range from theoretical foundations to the successful implementation of a prototype verifier. 1 Verification of stand-alone data-driven Web services We first outline our results on verification of data-driven Web services for single peers in isolation, then <b>dicsuss</b> extensions of the results to compositions of Web services. We focus on services interacting with external users or programs through a Web browser interface, and accessing an underlying database. Such services include e-commerce sites, scientific and other domain-specific portals, e-government, etc. These Web sites are ofte...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} gains {{of cooperation between}} South Africa and Namibia in the resource management of the valuable transboundary deep-water hake fish stock. By combining the game strategic Cournot model with the Gordon Schaefer bio-economic model, we develop a static model used to investigate strategic decisions in the duopoly when the countries 1) manage the stock as shared and act interdependently when maximising their profits within their Exclusive Economic Zone (a Cournot duopoly), and 2) act in terms of regional cooperation with joint management (Sole Owner harvesting). These equilibriums are compared with Open Access regulation and the alternative Stackelberg duopoly. Moreover, we {{examine the effects of}} changes in costs or catchability on the equilibrium solutions of efforts, harvest, stock and profits. The theoretical model is applied to the Benguela-fishery by calibrating a numerical model based on observed values of the historic stock abundance and harvest, and availiable observations of costs and efforts in the period 2007 - 2015. Main assumptions are symmetry in fleets and a uniformly distributed fish stock. First, in assuming that we are initially in steady state, we investigate equilibrium changes when moving from a current scenario to Cournot, followed by a move from Cournot to Sole Owner. Equilibrium effects of an increase in costs and catchability are studied, and the Stackelberg duopoly is <b>dicsussed.</b> Finally, the asymmetric Cournot is further explored by looking at equilibrium effects when countries differ in costs and catchability. The numerical findings suggest that there are potential gains of cooperation both in terms of 1) cooperation in stock research and managing the stock as shared (Cournot), and 2) active regional management (Sole Owner), when using pre-exploitation levels of the carrying capacity of the stock.

40|$|Traffic flow on road {{networks}} {{has been a}} continuous source of challenging mathematical problems. Mathematical modelling can provide an understanding of dynamics of traffic flow and hence helpful in organizing the flow through the network. In this dissertation macroscopic models for the traffic flow in {{road networks}} are presented. The primary interest is {{the extension of the}} existing macroscopic road network models based on partial differential equations (PDE model). In order to overcome the difficulty of high computational costs of PDE model an ODE model has been introduced. In addition, steady state traffic flow model named as RSA model on road networks has been <b>dicsussed.</b> To obtain the optimal flow through the network cost functionals and corresponding optimal control problems are defined. The solution of these optimization problems provides an information of shortest path through the network subject to road conditions. The resulting constrained optimization problem is solved approximately by solving unconstrained problem invovling exact penalty functions and the penalty parameter. A good estimate of the threshold of the penalty parameter is defined. A well defined algorithm for solving a nonlinear, nonconvex equality and bound constrained optimization problem is introduced. The numerical results on the convergence history of the algorithm support the theoretical results. In addition to this, bottleneck situations in the traffic flow have been treated using a domain decomposition method (DDM). In particular this method could be used to solve the scalar conservation laws with the discontinuous flux functions corresponding to other physical problems too. This method is effective even when the flux function presents more than one discontinuity within the same spatial domain. It is found in the numerical results that the DDM is superior to other schemes and demonstrates good shock resolution. Optimierung und Steuerung von Verkehrsfluß Netzwerke...|$|R
40|$|The study {{covers the}} design and use of {{accounting}} information system in small companies. When <b>dicsussing</b> the design of accounting information systems (AIS) we refer to {{the scope of the}} system and include management and financial accounting, budgets and ~alculations. We relate the use of AIS as a means to control business activities and include both management of individuals and activities. The study has been carried out of from the perspective of leadership. The aim has been to describe {{the design and}} use of AIS systems and to analyse and explain factors of importance to design and use AIS in small companies. The frame of reference comes to define research questions and analysis model. The model includes companies situation, management and leadership, structure of accounting department and the design and use of AIS. Three empirical studies have been done. Sub study 1, which is explorative, resulted in 5 hypotheses on the use of AIS in connection with company size, competitive situation, the manager's level of education, the manager's time spent on participation in day-to-day activities and how economy work is organised. Sub study 2 includes a survey with a response rate of 55 % (394 companies). The hypothesis testing shows that there is a covariation between AIS and company size, manager's education and how economy work is organised. In sub study 3, personal interviews were carried out in 11 companies that had either been classified as high or low users of AIS in sub study 2. As a conclusion it is appropriate to modify the used analysis model and to focus more on the manager, even the hypothesis testing in sub study 2 shows that there is a covariation between i. e size and use of AIS. As a reason for this we have found that a special type of individuals become managers "in the large companies". From sub study 3 we have observed that managers classified as high users of AIS are those {{with a high level of}} formal education. They collect and use internal as well as external information to a high extent and their decision-making is analytic. The high users of AIS also have a positive attitude to growth and often choose output control. Managers classified as low users of AIS are often those with little formal education. They collect and use small amounts of information and their decision-making is intuitive. In addition they use behavioural control to induce employees to work towards company goals. The low users of AIS also have a negative attitude to growth. Many of the low users of AIS use external help for accounting. To increase the use of AIS in companies that use external aid the dialogue between bookkeeping agencies and their clients should be improved. A better dialogue may result in the use of concepts more in true with company activities, leading to reports produced on a suitable level of aggregation and with proper updating.
