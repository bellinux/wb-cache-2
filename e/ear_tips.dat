5|$|The Marwari or Malani {{is a rare}} {{breed of}} horse from the Marwar (or Jodhpur) region of India. Known for its inward-turning <b>ear</b> <b>tips,</b> it comes in all equine colours, {{although}} pinto patterns {{tend to be the}} most popular with buyers and breeders. It is known for its hardiness, and is quite similar to the Kathiawari, another Indian breed from the Kathiawar region southwest of Marwar. Many breed members exhibit a natural ambling gait. The Marwari are descended from native Indian ponies crossed with Arabian horses, possibly with some Mongolian influence.|$|E

2500|$|The American Kennel Club (AKC) {{standard}} {{states the}} coat is a [...] "rich, lustrous golden of various shades", disallowing extremely light or extremely dark coats. This leaves the outer ranges of coat colour up to a judge's discretion when competing in conformation shows. Therefore, [...] "pure white" [...] and [...] "red" [...] are unacceptable, as is black. The Kennel Club (UK) also permits cream as an acceptable coat colour. Judges may also disallow Goldens with pink noses, or those lacking pigment. The Golden's coat {{can also be}} mahogany, referred to as [...] "redhead", although this is not accepted in the British show ring. [...] As a Golden grows older, its coat can become darker or lighter, along with a noticeable whitening of the fur on and around the muzzle. Puppy coats are usually much lighter than their adult coats, but a puppy with darker <b>ear</b> <b>tips</b> may indicate a darker adult color.|$|E

PCV 2 is the primary causative agent for Porcine Circovirus Associated Diseases (PCVAD). In cases when clinical signs of PCVAD (mainly PMWS) are present on a farm, the porcine necrotic ear syndrome is more often.

40|$|Western bean cutworm (WBC) is a corn pest {{that has}} {{expanded}} its range across Iowa and toward East Coast states. Before corn tassels, newly emerged WBC larvae move to the whorl and feed on the flag leaf. Once tasseling begins, they move to the green silks. Older larvae feed primarily on the <b>ear</b> <b>tip,</b> but some move outside the ear, chew through the husk and feed on kernels on the side or shank of the ear. Unlike corn earworm, multiple WBC larvae {{may be found in}} the same ear. Consuming the developing kernels can cause yield losses. In addition, the damage caused by feeding can allow pathogens to enter the ear and reduce grain quality...|$|R
40|$|Kernels at the <b>ear</b> <b>tip</b> {{of field}} grown maize (Zea mays L.) often abort during flowering, {{resulting}} in significant yield loss. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine if abortion is initiated by an inadequate supply of carbohydrates for growth of <b>ear</b> <b>tip</b> kernels, and/or by a hormonal signal. Field grown maize plants were either unshaded or shaded during flowering to increase kernel abortion. Nonstructural carbohydrates, indoleacetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), and cytokinins were measured in aborting and nonaborting kernels, before and after abortion occurred. Kernel abortion was initiated 8 days after anthesis (DAA) and was complete by 12 DAA, when kernels ceased dry weight accumulation. Concentrations of reducing sugars, sucrose, and starch in aborting kernels were not significantly different from those in nonaborting kernels up to 12 DAA. Also, total carbohydrate concentrations were higher in the cob of aborting than of nonaborting kernels from 8 to 26 DAA. These data suggest that kernel abortion is not initiated by an inadequate supply of carbohydrates. However, accumulation of reducing sugars in the cob of aborting kernels suggests that transfer of sugars from cob to kernels is impaired early in the abortion process. Differences in IAA, ABA, and cytokinin concentrations between aborting and nonaborting kernels were only observed after abortion was complete. Kernel abortion is apparently not initiated by a signal of these hormones. After completion of abortion, aborted kernels contained higher concentrations of ABA and lower concentrations of IAA than nonaborted kernels. There was also a trend toward higher concentrations of zeatin riboside in nonaborted kernels. Abscisic acid may promote kernel abortion after the process has been initiated. A mechanism for kernel abortion is discussed...|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the damage}} to corn is caused by larval feeding. Hatchlings locate roots and begin feeding on the fine root hairs, {{burrowing}} into root tips. As larvae grow, they feed on and tunnel into primary roots. When rootworms are abundant, larval feeding and deterioration of injured roots by root rot pathogens can result in roots being pruned to the stalk base. Severe root injury interferes with the roots' ability to transport water and nutrients, reduces growth and results in reduced grain production. Severe root injury may result in lodging of corn plants, making harvest more difficult. Silk feeding by adults can result in pruning at the <b>ear</b> <b>tip,</b> commonly called silk clipping. In field corn, beetle populations are occasionally high enough to cause severe silk clipping during pollen shed, which may interfere with pollination.|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of red-winged blackbirds {Agelaius phoemcei/s), common grackles (Quiscalus quiscula), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), and juvenile European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) feeding on ears of corn was studied in an aviary. The species differed significantly in their propensity to attack (penetrate the husk and feed on kernels) ears of corn. Redwings and starlings were more active attackers than grackles and cowbirds. Female redwings were generally more active attackers than males, but less efficient at opening husks and damaging ears. Redwings and starlings used primarily the gaping technique to penetrate husks and expose kernels. Redwings more commonly penetrated {{the side of}} the husk, whereas starlings gaped through the silk channel. Grackles did not gape; rather they pecked through the husk, keeping the bill closed. Cowbirds used gaping, but were the least efficient at penetrating the husk. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} by increasing the thickness and strength of the husks and the extension of the husk beyond the <b>ear</b> <b>tip,</b> varieties of corn can be made more resistant to damage by birds...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} fusarium ear rot epidemiology in maize (Zea mays L.) {{and host}} plant resistance to Fusarium species causing ear rot, in eastern Canada, through three major groups of experiments. A three-year disease survey that determines the causal agents of maize ear rot in Ontario; a three-year {{study on the}} stability of different genotypes to two different inoculation techniques across different environments; and a two-year study on fungal infection from an inoculum source using methods to detect infection spread. A survey of maize ear rot was conducted in eastern and western Ontario from 1991 - 1993 {{in order to develop}} a predictive model of ear rot incidence. Field data were collected on disease incidence, insect and/or bird damage, <b>ear</b> <b>tip</b> infection (silk), rainfall, and temperature. Isolations were made in the laboratory from samples showing evidence of infection, and the five prevalent Fusarium species (F. graminearum, F. moniliforme, F. proliferatum, F. sporotrichioides, and F. subglutinans) were enumerated. The profile of Fusarium species isolated varied considerably from year to year, and in a certain proportion between sites. Fusarium subglutinans was the most frequently isolated species and was associated with low rainfall in July. Fusarium moniliforme and F. proliferatum occurred mostly following the hot, dry summer of 1991. Fusarium graminearum presence increased significantly with higher precipitation in July. Presence of F. sporotrichioides was not associated directly with the incidence of ear rot. Insect damage and infection through the <b>ear</b> <b>tip</b> were the most important mode of fungal entry into maize ears. In the second major field study undertaken in east-central Ontario and south-western Quebec, the interaction between genotypes and environments was described using a Joint Regression Model and an Additive Main effects and Multiplicative Interaction effects (AMMI) model. The AMMI model was able to capture 68 % of the interaction across both inoculation methods, compared to 84 % for the Joint regression model. The number of cool and wet days (relative humidity over 80 %) observed in August was more critical for silk channel inoculation infections, and the number of wet days was more critical to achieve severe ear rot with the kernel-stab inoculation technique. A disease spread study showed that the Power Law model is a suitable model to predict fusarium ear rot spread over a distance below five metres from a small inoculum source of F. graminearum (strain sc DAOM 180378).
