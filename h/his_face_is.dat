5|$|In the lower-left {{corner of}} the {{painting}} holding a document bearing the royal seal, stands Bartolommeo Berrecci, architect who rebuilt Royal Wawel Castle. Next to him is Seweryn Boner, an important burgher and banker. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the two}} self-portraits of Jan Matejko. The second is the face of the royal jester Stańczyk. As Berrecci, Matejko portrayed himself as a gray eminence, dominating the scene, with a royal scepter in his hand.|$|E
5|$|In the teaser, a couple, the Van De Kamps (Adam Nelson and Shannon Hile), adopt Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) infant son, William (James and Travis Riker). The episode then {{jumps back}} a week. Scully takes William {{out of her}} car while an unknown man (Chris Owens) watches them. Later, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) is {{attacked}} in the X-Files office by the same man. After a struggle, Doggett subdues him. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> revealed to be horribly scarred.|$|E
5|$|In Sri Lanka {{the belief}} of Riri Yaka (Blood Demon) can be found. According to mythology, he tore his mother's breast and emerged {{into the human}} world as a demon killing her. The demon is said to give a primary form and eight other manifestations. In most cases {{he is said to}} be a giant who towers over his human victims. In the primary form, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> blue and splotched with blood. Red rays radiate from his bloodshot eyes. Blood pours from his {{nostrils}} and smoke billows from his ears. His mouth is filled with decomposing human flesh and his breath is foul. His entire body is coloured scarlet with dripping blood. He is closely associated with Mara, the demon king of death.|$|E

5000|$|On 31 August 1997 Rees-Jones {{was seriously}} {{injured in the}} crash that {{resulted}} in the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. The Princess' boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and the driver of the car, Henri Paul, were pronounced dead at the scene; Rees-Jones was the only survivor. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> flattened, with numerous bones broken or crushed. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> reconstructed from family photographs by maxillofacial surgeon Luc Chikhani, using about 150 pieces of titanium to hold the bones together and recreate the original shape. Within a year, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> nearly back to normal.|$|R
60|$|Wingrave smiled very faintly, {{otherwise}} <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> inscrutable.|$|R
5|$|Van der Weyden was {{strongly}} influenced by Jan van Eyck, and the painting {{is very similar to}} the earlier Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, usually dated to around 1434, with significant differences. The figure's positioning and colourisation are reversed, and Luke takes centre stage; <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> accepted as van der Weyden's self-portrait. Three near contemporary versions are in the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and the Groeningemuseum, Bruges. The Boston panel is widely considered the original from underdrawings that are both heavily reworked and absent in other versions. It is in relatively poor condition, having suffered considerable damage, which remains despite extensive restoration and cleaning.|$|E
5|$|Sergeant Lope (Demián Bichir) is {{the ranking}} {{military}} officer aboard the Covenant {{who is married}} to Sergeant Hallett. Lope leads the excursion on the planet's surface to the crashed Engineer ship. On the journey back to the lander, Lope notices Hallett's condition deteriorating, which alarms him. Upon reaching the lander, the ship explodes and a Neomorph attacks while another bursts from his husband's throat. A Neomorph attacks Lope when David intervenes and leads the survivors to his base, where Lope discovers Shaw's corpse. He is attacked by a Facehugger, but he is quickly and seemingly saved by Cole, who manages to cut it off him, though <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> severely burned by acid in the process. As Cole is killed by a now mature Alien, Lope escapes with the other survivors to the cargo lander. Aboard Covenant, Lope receives medical treatment, but dies when an Alien erupts from his chest, revealing that despite the short time that the Facehugger was on him, it succeeded in impregnating him.|$|E

Handles most of Libra's intelligence work.|$|E
25|$|<b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> {{expressive}} {{of extreme}} wrath, wrinkle-browed, left eye squinted or looking askance, lower teeth biting down the upper lip. He has the physique of a corpulent (round-bellied) child. He bears a straight sword {{in his right}} hand, and a lariat or noose in his left hand.

25|$|During {{the filming}} of The Mind Robber, Frazer Hines {{contracted}} chickenpox and was replaced {{for part of the}} serial by Hamish Wilson. This was written in as part of the story when Jamie is turned into a cardboard cut-out and has his face removed by the Master of the Land of Fiction. The Doctor's first attempt to reconstruct <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> unsuccessful. Eventually Jamie's real face is restored when Hines recovered.|$|E

25|$|Nivek Ogre as Pavi Largo, Rotti's middle child. Womanizing, narcissistic, vacuous, and effeminate, {{he wears}} the skinned {{face of a}} woman as a mask over his own, which is heavily scarred. Due to the way <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> attached, {{he is able to}} change faces on a whim. He has an Italian accent (to conceal his speech impediment, {{according}} to Zdunich) and is almost always surrounded by women, usually Genterns, the employees of GeneCo, who usually give Pavi his face surgeries.|$|E

25|$|The {{compound}} caused vast cellular anomalies {{that eventually}} killed {{all of the}} subjects except V, who developed advanced strength, reflexes, endurance and pain tolerance. Throughout the novel, V almost always wears his trademark Guy Fawkes mask, a shoulder-length wig of straight dark-brown hair and an outfit consisting of black gloves, tunic, trousers and boots. When not wearing the mask, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> not shown. When outside the Shadow Gallery, he completes this ensemble with a circa-17th century conical hat and floor-length cloak. His weapons of choice include daggers, explosives and tear gas.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} made into the film Lady in the Lake, {{starring}} and directed by Robert Montgomery. Montgomery tried a technique that had often been talked about in Hollywood but never used in a major film: he used the camera as the protagonist (Philip Marlowe) of the film. Other characters talk directly to the camera. The voice of Marlowe is that of Montgomery, but <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> shown only in reflections. Reviews of the film were not appreciative of the new approach. Most critics gave the director credit for trying an experimental technique but felt the experiment had been a failure.|$|E
25|$|Moses appears {{eight times}} in carvings that ring the Supreme Court Great Hall ceiling. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> {{presented}} {{along with other}} ancient figures such as Solomon, the Greek god Zeus and the Roman goddess of wisdom, Minerva. The Supreme Court Building's east pediment depicts Moses holding two tablets. Tablets representing the Ten Commandments can be found carved in the oak courtroom doors, on the support frame of the courtroom's bronze gates and in the library woodwork. A controversial image is one that sits directly above the Chief Justice of the United States' head. In {{the center of the}} 40-foot-long Spanish marble carving is a tablet displaying Roman numerals I through X, with some numbers partially hidden.|$|E

25|$|A mysterious man, Griffin, {{arrives at}} the local inn of the English village of Iping, West Sussex, during a snowstorm. The {{stranger}} wears a long-sleeved, thick coat and gloves; <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> hidden entirely by bandages except for a fake pink nose; and he wears a wide-brimmed hat. He is excessively reclusive, irascible, and unfriendly. He demands {{to be left alone}} and {{spends most of his time}} in his rooms working with a set of chemicals and laboratory apparatus, only venturing out at night. While Griffin is staying at the inn, hundreds of strange glass bottles (that he calls his luggage) arrive. Many local townspeople believe this to be very strange. He becomes the talk of the village with many theorizing as to his origins.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Voldemort's manifestation is as {{a face on}} {{the back}} of Quirrell's head, an effect {{achieved}} by computer generated imagery. Ian Hart, the actor who played Quirrell in the same film, provided the voice and the facial source for this character. Voldemort also appears in a scene in the Forbidden Forest where he is seen drinking the blood of a unicorn. As Voldemort's face was altered enough by CG work, and Hart's voice was affected enough, there was no confusion by Hart's playing of the two roles. In that film, he was also shown in a flashback sequence {{when he arrived at the}} home of James and Lily Potter to kill them. In this scene Voldemort is played by Richard Bremmer, though <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> never seen. His next appearance would be in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as the 16-year-old Tom Marvolo Riddle (portrayed by Christian Coulson).|$|E
