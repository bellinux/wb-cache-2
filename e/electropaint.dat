30|$|The {{inequality}} constraint (4) is nonlinear and complementary. The nonlinear inequality problem (1)-(4) {{arises from}} {{many kinds of}} physical and industrial applications such as the groundwater flow problem [1, 2], the <b>electropaint</b> process [3, 4], the contact problem [5], the free surface problem [6] and the variational inequalities theory [7, 8]. The numerical solution {{of this kind of}} problems can be obtained using the finite difference method and the finite element method (FEM) [1, 3, 4]. However, these domain-type numerical techniques require domain meshing which is usually arduous and computationally expensive.|$|E
30|$|Signorini {{boundary}} value problems are {{of great importance}} in many applications, such as the <b>electropaint</b> process and contact problem [1 – 3], etc. These problems involve inequality constraints {{on a part of}} the boundary that make them nonlinear. Therefore, development of efficient numerical algorithms for Signorini {{boundary value}} problems {{is one of the most}} important branches of modern computational mathematics and mechanics. Usually Signorini boundary value problems have been considered mathematically and numerically with variational inequalities, especially by the finite element method (FEM) [1 – 7] and the boundary element method (BEM) [8 – 13]. Recently, sound and efficient algorithms for the solution of these problems were still a very active field of research (see [14 – 20]).|$|E
40|$|Hopeite-type {{phosphate}} coatings {{in which}} zinc is partially replaced by other metals like manganese and nickel are {{of great interest}} for the automotive and home appliance industries. Such industries use phosphate conversion coatings on galvanized steels in association with cataphoretic <b>electropainting.</b> Zinc phosphates modified with manganese and nickel are isomorphic with the hopeite, and the phase identification using X-ray diffraction is difficult. In this paper, the phosphate coatings are identified using the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a meshfree method for the numerical solution of Signorini problems. In this method, a projection iterative algorithm {{is used to}} convert the boundary inequality constraints into a fixed point equation. Then, the boundary value problem is reformulated as boundary integral equations and the unknown boundary variables are interpolated by the point interpolation scheme. Thus, only a nodal data structure on the boundary of a domain is required, and boundary conditions can be implemented directly and easily. The convergence of this method is verified theoretically. Numerical examples involving groundwater flow and <b>electropainting</b> problems are also provided to illustrate the performance and usefulness of the method...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of charged droplets of a conducting viscous liquid. The flow is driven by electrostatic repulsion and capillarity. These droplets {{are known to be}} linearly unstable when the electric charge is above the Rayleigh critical value. Here we investigate the nonlinear evolution that develops after the linear regime. Using a boundary elements method, we find that a perturbed sphere with critical charge evolves into a fusiform shape with conical tips at time t 0, and that the velocity at the tips blows up as (t 0 − t) α, with α close to − 1 / 2. In the neighborhood of the singularity, the shape of the surface is self-similar, and the asymptotic angle of the tips is smaller than the opening angle in Taylor cones. One of the leading problems in fluid dynamics is the formation of singularities on charged masses of fluid. These problems are relevant in a variety of 1 physical and technological situations, such as the breakup of water droplets in thunderstorms, electrospraying and <b>electropainting...</b>|$|R
