The observatory remained the official timekeeper for Canada until 1905, when that responsibility was transferred to Ottawa's Dominion Observatory. At exactly 11:55am the clocks in Toronto fire halls were rung by an electrical signal from the Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{vaccines}} {{have been}} an elusive goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating {{the potential for a}} malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live, radiation-attenuated sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites. Since the 1970s, there has been a considerable <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> similar vaccination strategies for humans. The first vaccine, called RTS,S, was approved by European regulators in 2015.|$|E
50|$|Malarial parasites {{that are}} {{resistant}} to the drugs that are currently available to infections are common and this has led <b>to</b> increased <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> new drugs. Resistance <b>to</b> recently <b>developed</b> drugs such as artemisinin has also been reported. The problem of drug resistance in malaria has driven <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> vaccines.|$|R

5|$|The Advisory Committee on Uranium was the {{beginning}} of the US government's <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> an atomic bomb, but it did not vigorously pursue the development of a weapon. It was superseded by the National Defense Research Committee in 1940, and then the Office of Scientific Research and Development in 1941. The Frisch–Peierls memorandum and the British Maud Reports eventually prompted Roosevelt to authorize a full-scale development effort in January 1942. The work of fission research was taken over by the United States Army Corps of Engineers's Manhattan District in June 1942, which directed an all-out bomb development program known as the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|The Smyth Report is {{the common}} name of an {{administrative}} history written by American physicist Henry DeWolf Smyth about the Manhattan Project, the Allied <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> atomic bombs during World War II. The full title of the report is A General Account of the Development of Methods of Using Atomic Energy for Military Purposes. It was {{released to the public}} on August 12, 1945, just days after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9.|$|E
5|$|The <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> a lighter, quieter {{camera with}} a reflex {{viewfinder}} {{led to the}} introduction of the Panavision Silent Reflex (PSR) in 1967. The camera could provide a shutter angle of up to 200 degrees. Many refinements were made to the PSR during the first few years after its introduction, and it soon {{became one of the most}} popular studio cameras in the world. Panavision also began manufacturing spherical lenses for 1.85:1 photography, garnering a significant share of the market.|$|E

5|$|The navy {{has looked}} into {{creating}} precision guided artillery rounds {{for use with}} the current fleet of cruisers and destroyers. The most recent attempt to modify the guns for longer range came with the Advanced Gun System mounts that were to be installed aboard the Zumwalt-class destroyers, although the navy {{has been involved in}} the Long Range Land Attack Projectile and Ballistic Trajectory Extended Range Munition projects for over 10 years in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> Extended Range Guided Munitions.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the {{development}} of the Mk. I to III, various units had been flying the systems in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> suitable interception techniques. Very early on it was decided to dispense with the full reporting chain of the Dowding system and have the radar operators at the Chain Home (CH) sites talk to the fighters directly, greatly reducing delays. This improved matters, and on an increasing number of occasions aircraft received direction from the CH stations towards real targets.|$|E
5|$|After 1906, the Canadian Government {{took over}} the Halifax Dockyard (now CFB Halifax) from the Royal Navy. This {{dockyard}} later became the command centre of the Royal Canadian Navy upon its founding in 1910. Just before the First World War, the Canadian government began to make a determined, costly <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> the harbour and waterfront facilities. The outbreak of the war brought Halifax back to prominence. As the Royal Canadian Navy had virtually no seaworthy ships of its own, the Royal Navy assumed responsibility for maintaining Atlantic trade routes by re-adopting Halifax as its North American base of operations. In 1915, management of the harbour fell {{under the control of}} the Royal Canadian Navy under the supervision of Captain Superintendent Edward Harrington Martin; by 1917 there was a growing naval fleet in Halifax, including patrol ships, tugboats, and minesweepers.|$|E

25|$|Until recently, most {{security}} {{properties of}} most cryptosystems were demonstrated using empirical techniques or using ad hoc reasoning. Recently, {{there has been}} considerable <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> formal techniques for establishing the security of cryptosystems; this has been generally called provable security. The general idea of provable security is to give arguments about the computational difficulty needed to compromise some security aspect of the cryptosystem (i.e., to any adversary).|$|E
50|$|In interviews, Emily Short has {{explained}} that Galatea arose {{out of her}} <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> advanced dialog coding for interactive fiction engines. Although code for simple conversational programs like ELIZA have existed since the 1960s, and limited dialog options have existed in interactive fiction since the 1970s, Short's <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> chatterbot-like dialog required her to produce a simple test case scenario to test NPC interaction.
