5|$|Given the {{popularity}} of the film's cars with customizers and hot rodders in the years since its release, their fate immediately after the film <b>is</b> <b>ironic.</b> All were offered for sale in San Francisco newspaper ads; only the '58 Impala (driven by Ronny Howard) attracted a buyer, selling for only a few hundred dollars. The yellow Deuce and the white T-bird went unsold, despite being priced as low as US$3,000. The registration plate on Milner's yellow deuce coupe is THX138 on a yellow, California license plate, slightly altered, reflecting Lucas's earlier science fiction film.|$|E
5|$|Bart goes to {{the video}} game store and coerces the clerk to let him buy the new and violent Grand Theft Scratchy game, only to have it confiscated by Marge. While Bart mopes, a video game manual crashes {{down from the sky}} in front of him. Reading through the manual, Bart discovers that he {{and the rest of his}} family have special powers. Later, Bart uses his Bartman powers to stop Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph from {{stealing}} from the Natural History Museum, Homer uses his ability to become a huge ball and win an eating contest, Lisa uses her powers of meditation to stop a deforestation project, and Marge uses her powers to influence crowds to stop the release of Grand Theft Scratchy in Springfield, although Lisa points out it <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> she used violence to stop a violent game.|$|E
5|$|In From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney {{writes that}} Harold Andrews bullies Ellen Ripley, who is {{demoralized}} {{after the events}} of the first two Alien films. According to Kaveney, Andrews' method of directing the prison from monitors <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> because David Fincher directed the film the same way (which Sigourney Weaver disliked). In David Fincher: Films That Scar, a literary analysis of the director, Mark Browning writes that Harold Andrews' totalitarian control of Fury 161 exempts Dillon's religiosity because Andrews views religion as a tool to prevent violence and provide control. Film critic Malcolm Johnson wrote in a Hartford Courant review that Andrews was a petty but potent dictator, similar to Benito Mussolini.|$|E

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>ironic,</b> but Viktor, {{whose name}} is {{associated}} with historical and mythological paintings, initially avoided these subjects at all costs. For his graphic composition of Christ and Pontius Pilate Before the People, the Academy awarded a small silver medal to him.|$|E
25|$|The mytheme of the Judgement of Paris {{naturally}} offered artists {{the opportunity}} to depict a sort of beauty contest between three beautiful female nudes, but the myth, at least since Euripides, rather concerns a choice among the gifts that each goddess embodies. The bribery involved <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> and a late ingredient.|$|E
25|$|Apollodorus {{recounted the}} tale in his Bibliotheca. King Eurytus {{was an expert}} archer who taught his sons his {{knowledge}} of the bow and arrow. He promised his daughter Iole to whomever could beat him and his sons in an archery contest. The sons shot so well that they beat all the others from the kingdom. Heracles then heard of the prize and eagerly entered the contest for he desired the maiden. Heracles shot with keenness and even beat Eurytus' scores. It <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> because Eurytus in his early years had taught Heracles to become an archer.|$|E
25|$|A Modest Proposal, by Jonathan Swift, <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> fiction proposing {{the selling}} of {{children}} to save Ireland from starvation; the proposal {{was not intended to}} be literal.|$|R
5000|$|... "It <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> {{that even}} my small triumphs were not {{attributed}} to me." [...] (Pippa Dexter: in [...] "Pippa's Story", 29 June 1968 Woman's Weekly page 17) ...|$|R
50|$|This {{campaign}} <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> for the Nationalist party, {{since it}} was one of its Members of Parliament that presented a private member’s bill before Parliament for its introduction.|$|R
25|$|Montoto {{has been}} {{described}} as having “a very ostentatious lifestyle.” He owns a BMW and a mansion in Palermo Chico, and at one point owned a private jet. He is a devout Catholic, who “is proud of his photos with Pope Benedict XVI and the right-wing Bishop Emilio Ogñenovich.” He {{has been described}} as “struggling with his weight” over the years and as maintaining a low profile while accumulating power and becoming a millionaire with “a sumptuous mansion in Barrio Parque.” Many commentators have stated that it <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> to see a former Montonero driving a BMW.|$|E
25|$|Howard and Harold are {{helicopter}} {{parents to}} Clyde {{and tend to}} be overprotective of him. Howard feels {{the need to protect}} Clyde at all times and never lets him out of sight, unless he is with Lincoln or at school. Howard is also sensitive and overemotional, often needing Harold to calm him down when he gets worked up. Harold's demeanor is the opposite; he is straightforward and even-tempered. Both of the McBrides have a fondness for cats and have adopted two, Cleopawtra and Nepurrtiti (named after Cleopatra and Nefertiti, two Egyptian queens). Their surname <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> because a bride is a newlywed woman, but they are two married men.|$|E
25|$|As the 20th century progressed, {{trade on}} the Newcastle and Gateshead quaysides {{gradually}} declined, until by the eighties {{both sides of the}} river were looking rather derelict. Shipping company offices had closed along with offices of firms related to shipping. There were also derelict warehouses lining the riverbank. A decision was taken by local government to re-develop the Newcastle quayside and this was begun in the 1990s following a master plan. New offices, restaurants, bars and residential accommodation were built and the area has changed {{in the space of a}} few years into a vibrant area. It <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that this development has partially returned the focus of Newcastle to the riverside, where it was in medieval times.|$|E
50|$|The Ruth sale {{cemented}} the Red Sox-Yankees alliance, which <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> {{given their}} historically bitter rivalry. A few months later, {{the two teams}} drew even closer together {{in a dispute over}} Fenway Park.|$|R

5000|$|In 2017, Phillips {{appeared}} in {{an episode of}} the rebooted One Day at a Time (2017 TV series), featured as Pam Valentine. The role <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> given Phillips' history: she portrayed a counselor.|$|R
25|$|Cavalry {{were rarely}} {{used by the}} Assyrians or many other Mesopotamians until the 9th century BC, when their use is {{mentioned}} {{during the reign of}} Tukulti-Ninurta II. Before then, many nomads or steppe warriors relied on cavalry, who raided Assyrian lands. The Assyrians had to counter this mobile form of warfare and so beat their opponents, notably the Iranians, at their own game. Perhaps the greatest outside influence is that of the Iranian Medes. It <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that the raiding by that people assisted Assyrian attempts in building a cavalry army with which to destroy the Kingdom of Elam. However, Assyrian attempts were not without difficulties; horse archers were used but could not use their bows and the reins of their horses at the same time. As a result, cavalry under Ashurnasirpal are depicted in pairs, with one rider holding both reins and the other shooting with a bow. The Assyrians experienced fewer problems with cavalry when they were deployed as lancers; under Tiglath Pileser III, the Assyrian Cavalry continued to be paired of but this time each warrior held his own lance and controlled his own horse. By the 7th century BC, mounted Assyrian warriors were well armed with a bow and a lance, and armored with lamellar armour, while their mounts were equipped with fabric armour, providing limited yet useful protection in close combat and against missiles. Cavalry were to form the core of the later Assyrian armies.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 Holden {{published}} a novel, Mr. Big Maus, a caper centering on contemporary corporate culture run amok and one iconoclast's mission to rebalance an unjust world. Mr. Big Maus is {{a blend of}} late-modern, contemporary, and post-modern sensibilities, with a plot that is linear and integrated, which eschews mysticism, and provides action that is sudden, direct and rational. This is countered by a narrative that <b>is</b> <b>ironic,</b> characters who are self-reflexive yet irrational, and spiced with the nuance of metafiction. Its protagonist is flawed, disempowered, contending with alienation, and questing to discover identity. The plot presents universal themes within the context of everyday life and features evolution in its character’s lives. It offers the audience a moral resolution. Substantively, the book spotlights history and memory, celebrates intellect and speech, and is optimistic and ultimately uplifting. Among its key themes is discourse about: time, consciousness and human practices. This is seen, above all, through the constant presence, use, and dependence on technology (i.e. the emerging present and looming future), in contrast to the protagonist's constant nostalgia for a reliance on products of cinema, music, television and literature (i.e. the recent and distant past). A second theme is the changing America landscape—reflected in its ubiquitous immigrants—as well as the clash of generational and institutional values. A final theme, built from strands of the previous two, is the ways that innovation, invention, commercialization and business influence and are influenced by the poles of technological determinism and independent creative expression.|$|E
500|$|It <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that Rifenburg {{was born}} in Petoskey, Michigan in 1926 for several reasons. [...] Ted Petoskey preceded Rifenburg as an All-American end on the University of Michigan {{football}} team. Petoskey had excelled {{as a representative of}} Saginaw County in MHSAA competition. Petoskey posted significant football accomplishments in 1926 making 1926 a significant year for himself as well. Achieving All-American status as an end at Michigan would be Rifenburg's next step after excelling in MHSAA competition.|$|E

2500|$|In 2017, Phillips {{appeared}} in {{an episode of}} the rebooted One Day at a Time (2017 TV series), featured as Pam Valentine. [...] The role <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> given Phillips' history: she portrayed a counselor.|$|R
25|$|After Novak’s death, David Frum {{commented that}} the whole episode had <b>been</b> <b>ironic</b> given that Richard Armitage, Joe Wilson, Valerie Plame, and Novak all had exactly the same {{opinions}} against a potential war in Iraq.|$|R
500|$|Another {{approach}} to critique {{taken in the}} classroom has been to propose the insignificance of female characters in the story as sexist. While Bilbo {{may be seen as}} a literary symbol of small folk of any gender, a gender-conscious approach can help students establish notions of a [...] "socially symbolic text" [...] where meaning is generated by tendentious readings of a given work. By this interpretation, it <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that the first authorized adaptation was a stage production in a girls' school.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the book for The American Scholar, Siva Vaidhyanathan of New York University wrote that MacLeod [...] "...delivers a lively, {{personal}} account of the ways intellectual property messes with people—and how he messes with intellectual property", and that, [...] "McLeod <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> and witty, writing with a hip-hop-influenced youth-savvy diction that demonstrates his confidence and engagement with the material and the culture that means so much to him." [...] Davis Schneiderman wrote positively of the work in a review for American Book Review, comparing it to similar works on the subject matter, including No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies (2000) by Naomi Klein, and writings of Michael Moore and Al Franken.|$|E
500|$|The picture's {{significance}} {{has been}} the subject of broad speculation. Washington Post reviewer Desson Howe said that despite its emotional impact, the final scene [...] "feels more like a punchline for punchline's sake, a trumped-up coda". In her book-length analysis of the Coen brothers' films, Rowell suggests that Barton's fixation on the picture <b>is</b> <b>ironic,</b> considering its low culture status and his own pretensions toward high culture (speeches to the contrary notwithstanding). She further notes that the camera focuses on Barton himself as much as the picture while he gazes at it. At one point, the camera moves past Barton to fill the frame with the woman on the beach. This tension between objective and subjective points of view appears again at the end of the film, when Barton finds himself– [...] in a sense– [...] inside the picture.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} {{criticism}} that the PRC need {{to spend more money}} on its poor, sick and elderly instead on the anniversary celebration. Activist Wang Dan criticized the PRC government's celebration of democracy to <b>be</b> <b>ironic.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "Born to Run" [...] named [...] "The {{unofficial}} youth anthem of New Jersey" [...] by the New Jersey state legislature; something Springsteen {{always found}} to <b>be</b> <b>ironic,</b> {{considering that the}} song [...] "is about leaving New Jersey" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{title of}} the film is a {{reference}} to the 1977 documentary film ABBA: The Movie, featuring fellow Swedes ABBA. The reference is intended to <b>be</b> <b>ironic,</b> since Ebba Grön's style is very different from that of ABBA.|$|R
500|$|Sexuality {{is one of}} {{the primary}} themes of the novel. Letters by Brooke {{recently}} rediscovered by historians expressed much conflict within himself about his own sexuality. This same sexual conflict becomes a major element of Dawson's novel. Nell is consistently shocked by Brooke's sexual desires and encounters throughout the novel, {{while at the same time}} Brooke is confused by his lustful desires for Nell and his desire to court sexually constrained upper-class women. Brooke has other causes of internal conflict. In his search for the right person to lose his virginity to, he has a homosexual encounter almost out of desperation. The continual conflict between a desire to be loved, and the inability to find a lover <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> when compared to the title of the novel and poem which inspired the novel: Brooke is clearly not a [...] "great lover".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{repetition}} of this theme in the text, there is some discussion about its pervading influence. It <b>is</b> <b>ironic,</b> critic Clarence B. Lindsay posits, that while McGregor is busy organizing the marching men, he (as opposed to the narrator) all but ignores the chaos in the city he is constantly traversing. On a larger scale, {{it is difficult to}} know whether Sherwood Anderson takes seriously the nostalgic notion of Civil War soldiers marching together as an inspiration for the McGregor's [...] "aesthetic of power" [...] or whether the exaggerated traits of McGregor are, in fact, ironic representations of the benefits of order. This view is furthered by Mark Whalan who likened Anderson's [...] "imposition of order by masculine force" [...] to the [...] "masculine misogyny" [...] of the Italian Futurists many of whom, unlike Anderson (who did not actually see combat during his military service), moved away from their glorification of violence after experiencing World War I.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2014, Michael Stevens of the YouTube channel Vsauce devoted {{time to the}} {{discussion}} of irony in the episode [...] "Dord". In this video, Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself <b>is</b> <b>ironic.</b> It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life knows we need, and what life thinks we need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when {{all you need is a}} knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, you have all of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need right now is only spoons... or the last thing you need right now is a knife." ...|$|E
5000|$|Before long, however, {{internal}} tensions {{developed in}} the new party, with Barnard accusing Lee of behaving in an egotistical and autocratic manner [...] - [...] this <b>was</b> <b>ironic,</b> considering Lee's criticism of the old Labour Party leadership on the same grounds.|$|R
5000|$|Players {{lettering}} before 1960 {{could have}} been selected for either offensive or defensive positions. Selecting Jim Marshall as an offensive tackle <b>was</b> <b>ironic,</b> given that he played professionally for 20 years as a defensive lineman, primarily with the Minnesota Vikings.|$|R
5000|$|John Haiman writes: [...] "There is an {{extremely}} close connection between sarcasm and irony, and literary theorists in particular often treat sarcasm as simply the crudest and least interesting form of irony." [...] Also, he adds:First, situations may <b>be</b> <b>ironic,</b> but only people can be sarcastic. Second, people may <b>be</b> unintentionally <b>ironic,</b> but sarcasm requires intention. What is essential to sarcasm {{is that it is}} overt irony intentionally used by the speaker as a form of verbal aggression.|$|R
