In contrast to ATV, Fidesz-backed Origo.hu reported three days later that Áder would remain as President despite such [...] "serious candidates" [...] as Balog and Barnabás Lenkovics, a former President of the Constitutional Court. The news portal added that re-election was a decision only for Áder, who had asked for time to consider his candidature. After a long conservation with Kövér, Áder telephoned Orbán to say that for his part, he was willing to undertake a second presidential term, ATV wrote.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyses}} a corpus of audio recordings of authentic business meetings. The recordings {{were made in}} a variety of companies in the UK, and also in Eire, Germany and Japan. The companies which provided the data vary considerably in terms of area of business and size. The meetings themselves differ in terms of number of speakers, the relationships of the speakers, and the purposes and topics discussed; throughout the thesis the influence of these factors on communication is discussed. Previous studies of the language used in business meetings have focussed on either specific aspects of one type of meeting, such as strategies in sales negotiations, or have attempted to describe the attributes of `the business meeting' based on arguably unrepresentative data. For example, frameworks purporting to describe the genre of the meeting have been based solely on internal, or intra-organisational, data. This study is unique in that it analyses and compares a wide range of both internal and <b>external</b> <b>meetings.</b> The main purpose of the thesis is to explore the corpus in order to construct a generic model which accounts for the recurrence and dynamism within the data. This involves quantitative and qualitative analysis at the level of lexicogrammatical choice, including pronouns, deontic-modal expressions, certain key words such as problem, issue and if, metaphors and idioms, and vague language. Various `higher level' factors are also explored, such as speaker goals, strategies, conflict, convergence, `face', turn-taking, and overall structure. Through applying different approaches, such as corpus linguistics, discourse analysis, conversation analysis, and genre analysis, to the same data, a more fine-grained understanding of the data is achieved, and the assumption that business meetings are demonstrably different from and yet related to everyday spoken English is explored. The results indicate that business meetings can be categorised as a distinct genre with recurrent aspects which speakers and listeners orient towards, recognisable to both participants and observers. The study also highlights consistent differences between internal and <b>external</b> <b>meetings.</b> There is also evidence for a probabilistic relationship between the genre and the language used therein.

The paper presents a case study from Stockholm that takes a workplace perspective and looks at knowledge-intensive work in a public sector organization.

40|$|Background Evidence-based {{practice}} has increasingly {{been recognized as}} a priority by professional physiotherapy organizations and influential researchers and clinicians in the field. Numerous studies {{in the past decade}} have documented that physiotherapists hold generally favorable attitudes to evidence-based practice and recognize the importance of using research to guide their clinical practice. Research has predominantly investigated barriers to research use. Less is known about the circumstances that actually support use of research by physiotherapists. This study explores the conditions at different system levels that physiotherapists in Sweden perceive to be supportive of their use of research in clinical practice. Methods Patients in Sweden do not need a referral from a physician to consult a physiotherapist and physiotherapists are entitled to choose and perform any assessment and treatment technique they find suitable for each patient. Eleven focus group interviews were conducted with 45 physiotherapists, each lasting between 90 and 110  minutes. An inductive approach was applied, using topics rather than questions to allow the participants to generate their own questions and pursue their own priorities {{within the framework of the}} aim. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results Analysis of the data yielded nine favorable conditions at three system levels supporting the participant’s use of research in clinical practice: two at the individual level (attitudes and motivation concerning research use; research-related knowledge and skills), four at the workplace level (leadership support; organizational culture; research-related resources; knowledge exchange) and three at the extra-organizational level (evidence-based practice guidelines; <b>external</b> <b>meetings,</b> networks, and conferences; academic research and education). Conclusions Supportive conditions for physiotherapists’ use of research exist at multiple interdependent levels, including the individual, workplace, and extra-organizational levels.

40|$|This is {{a thesis}} about knowledge-intensive {{work and the}} {{organizational}} con-texts of such work. The specific objective is to analyze the geography of work. The geography of work may diverge from the geography of employ-ment when paid work is undertaken at the premises of client organizations, during commuting, on business trips, in <b>external</b> <b>meetings,</b> {{at home or in}} other places. The focus is on work practice and the perspective of everyday life. The study examines where knowledge workers are located and where knowledge work occurs. It is about what knowledge workers actually do. The everyday perspective is about the relationship between paid work and unpaid work. To understand the organization of knowledge-intensive work in a time–space context, different possibilities and constraints must be taken into con-sideration. This thesis has a time–geographical approach. The case study examines knowledge-intensive organizations located in central Stockholm. The organizations are in PR/communications, management consultancy, and research and development sectors. Both private and public sector organiza-tions are considered. The empirical study combines interviews, time diaries and questionnaires. The NVivo software program is employed to analyze the interview data. The main conclusion from the thesis is that in order to under-stand knowledge-intensive work, different factors such as relations, attitudes and norms need to be considered. These factors affect the organization of work, which in turn is affected by the choices, possibilities, constraints, ex-pectations and negotiations of different actors (i. e. employees, employers, family, clients and colleagues). The working time of the knowledge workers investigated in this study is mainly spent at the office of their employers. Social interaction with col-leagues and clients {{is an important part of}} their work. Work routines involve many meetings, both face-to-face and virtual. Face-to-face interactions play a crucial role in shaping the geography of work; teamwork is important.

Study one utilised a sample of 180 University students, business professionals, and members of the general public to clarify the dominate/prototypical features of successful and unsuccessful organisational meetings. The three leading internal aspects found to impact on successful meetings were: 'Active group participation', 'clear and detailed agenda', and 'positive outcome'. Conversely, the three leading internal aspects found to impact on unsuccessful meetings were 'Necessary attendees were not invited or present', 'unresolved conflict' and 'lack of group participation with unequal interaction'. Study two utilised the prototypical meeting features identified in study one as indicators of successful and unsuccessful meeting outcomes, and examined the organisational aspects <b>external</b> to the <b>meeting</b> context that influence these meeting outcomes. One hundred and seventy nine individuals from 30 collections of individuals who participate in meetings took part in study two. Team functioning, high cohesion (Group Integration to the Task and Attraction to the Group Social), norming and performing stages of development, Teamthink, and positive job-related affect were external aspects found to influence successful meeting outcomes.

However, if the king carried out his office poorly, he feared that he would suffer hell or be struck down by a deity. As scholar Charles Drekmeier notes, [...] "dharma stood above the king, and his failure to preserve it must accordingly have disastrous consequences".

This situation has led some authors (1) to claim that higher education has gone from being a public asset to an economics-centered model in which many institutions are evaluated by their ability to secure funding and not actually to provide the system with feedback. In Latin America and in some universities in Spain (2) the process of accountability has been linked with a growing tension placed on these institutions, dominated by conflicts between groups and individuals, both in terms of the struggle to successfully obtain financial subsidies and of <b>meeting</b> <b>external</b> demands to certify the academic quality of the teaching staff and the teaching programs. Since the early 1990 s, several economic incentive programs linked with attaining indicators (as defined by externally developed standards) have been designed, thus creating a highly fragmented evaluation system, with very diverse criteria and characteristics. Within this highly complex context, a small number of health promotion (HP) graduate pro-grams have emerged in some higher education insti...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} methods and analytical approach {{contained in the}} paper have been replicated by Malaysian, South African and Nigerian construction management researchers. A number of factors and associated sub-factors influencing the matching of project managers to construction projects were identified after a thorough review of related literature and interviews of management personnel involved {{in the selection of}} project managers. There appears to be a consensus among the construction industry management in Bangkok on the factors, which influence the selection of construction project managers. A detailed survey of the top 100 construction companies in Thailand was conducted, to determine what factors are used in the industry to assign project managers to projects. A total of 73 completed questionnaires were received from 36 companies. It was established that influencing factors attract some degree of relative importance irrespective of the construction project category. The data showed no statistical difference between the three project categories in the weights given to the various factors considered for project manager assignment. Personal characteristics are considered least important for effective project management. It is argued that, at least in the Thai context, contractors are careful in assigning Project Managers that are capable of <b>meeting</b> <b>external</b> customers' needs. A matching model was developed based on the identified influencing factors and the relative importance they attached in the process of selecting the construction project managers. The model requires input in terms of the project requirements and evaluation of candidates' characteristics with respect to the influencing factors...|$|R
