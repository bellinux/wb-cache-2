40|$|Background: The {{increasing}} number of survivors <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>events</b> are enlightening new needs to guarantee appropriate care {{and quality of life}} support at home. A potential application of telemedicine is to provide home care and rehabilitation. Within the framework of an EU FP 7 project called Integrated Home Care (IHC Grant Agreement no: 222954) we performed an overview of reviews on the telefacilities for the homecare in stroke patients. Materials and methods: A broad literature research was conducted in PUBMED, Web of Science ® and The Cochrane Library databases. We included and graded all the reviews according to the following criteria: published in English in peer-reviewed journals, targeting stroke as adult patients (age> 18 yr.) and considering a homecare setting in the intervention. Results: 6 reviews were included (i. e. 1 systematic review with meta-analysis and 5 non-systematic reviews). No conclusions can be stated on the effectiveness of telerehabilitation compared to other home treatments, due to the insufficient data available, nevertheless strong indications emerged for the inclusion of “all cause mortality ” and “hospital admission ” as primary outcomes. Besides “QoL”, “cost”, “adherence ” and “patient acceptability...|$|E

40|$|Smell (olfactory) {{and taste}} (gustatory) are key senses in the {{regulation}} of nourishment and individual safety. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions have been infrequently reported together in patients <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> (Landis et al., 2006; Leopold et al., 2006). This case report details two patients who experienced smell and taste dysfunction <b>following</b> minor <b>stroke</b> <b>events.</b> Symptoms reported included hyposmia (diminished sense of smell) and anosmia (complete loss of smell), and dysgeusia (distorted taste). Patients' sense of smell and taste were assessed in an ambulatory care stroke prevention clinic eight months <b>following</b> their <b>strokes.</b> Patient A presented with minor stroke due to a lesion in the anterior circulation, patient B with a lesion in the posterior circulation. Both patients reported intense olfactory and gustatory dysfunction immediately <b>following</b> their <b>strokes.</b> Examination revealed a general inability to detect subtle odours {{and the ability to}} identify only 'sweet' tastes for both patients. In addition, both patients reported heavily salting or sweetening their food to mask the distorted and unpleasant taste, which also impacted comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. Patients and their spouses reported a decrease in their appreciation of family-related activities due to the patients' olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Patients reported weight loss, lack of energy and strength, likely due to poor nutrition. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are potentially deleterious outcomes <b>following</b> minor <b>stroke</b> and should be assessed by health care professionals prior to patient discharge.

This study explored the oral history {{of people who had}} experienced a recent stroke and sought their testimony about their lives during the first year <b>following</b> the <b>stroke</b> <b>event.</b> It described the journey of adjustment of four stroke 'survivors' and their families over a period of eight months. Their lived experience focused not only on being a survivor of the stroke itself but also the healthcare 'system', particularly their stay in hospital. The person living with a stroke also identified themselves as 'survivors' at home as they struggled on a day-to-day basis to adjust to a changed relationship with their bodies, families and sought {{to make sense of the}} <b>stroke</b> <b>event</b> and its impact based on a review of their life history as a couple or family. The testimony emphasised a journey that requires greater psychological support and the importance of life history work in chronic illness. The data collection includes interviews with four different stroke 'survivors' who were all interviewed on three different occasions. The characteristics of the sample represented a diverse range of disabling effects <b>following</b> <b>stroke,</b> including difficulties with ambulation, speech and completing some activities of daily living. The interviews were conducted in their own homes and completed with the person with a stroke and their partner/family member.

They recommended that ECG is important for detecting several stroke risk factors/predictors including atrial fibrillation and left ventricular hypertrophy. They both are components of the Framingham Stroke risk score. Multiple other ECG traits such as cardiac electrical/structural remodelling-Q wave, QRS/QT duration, bundle blocks, P wave duration/amplitude/dispersion, and other waveform angles and slopes appeared as potential predictors of strokes.

We assessed heart rate variability and catecholamine levels in lieu of stroke lesion localization. Materials and Methods: A total of 60 stroke patients and 31 healthy controls {{were enrolled in the}} study. Plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were measured on the first, third, and seventh days <b>following</b> the <b>stroke</b> <b>event.</b> Heart rate variability was evaluated with time-domain and frequency-domain analyses via 24 -hour Holter monitor recordings. Results: On the first and third day <b>following</b> the <b>stroke,</b> norepinephrine levels were significantly higher in all patient groups as compared to controls. Epinephrine levels on the first, third and seventh days after the stroke were significantly higher in patients with lesions in the right middle cerebral artery territory than controls. In frequency-domain analysis, patients with right middle cerebral artery territory lesions had greater low frequency and low frequency to high frequency ratio values than controls. Time-domain analysis revealed significant decreases in the standard deviation from the mean for 5 -minute 288 R-R intervals in patients with lesions in the right middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery territory when contrasted with controls. Patients with lesions in the right middle cerebral artery territory demonstrated the highest increase in the percentage of consecutive R-R intervals differing by more than 50 ms (pNN 50) as compared to the control group.

40|$|Ischemic stroke is a {{condition}} characterized by loss of brain function due to interruption of blood supply to the brain. A central core of dead cells, the infarct, forms and expands over time. Thus, the extent of ischemic injury is not defined immediately <b>following</b> the <b>stroke</b> <b>event.</b> Prevention of lesion expansion can then limit neurological deficit, making determination of the mechanism of ischemia -induced cell death of great importance. Using an in vitro model of the penumbral rim, the dynamic border between the dead cells of the infarct core and the unaffected healthy tissue, we studied the expression of CCRL 2 in relation to ischemic cell death via potential intracellular mediators. CCRL 2 is a novel chemokine receptor, previously reported to have no signaling function. However, CCRL 2 {{has yet to be}} studied in an ischemic context, and a microarray of mouse brain tissue slices treated with IS for 2 hours, reveal CCRL 2 {{to be one of the}} most highly up-regulated genes. Western blots reveal CCRL 2 to be up-regulated after 14 hours of IS treatment along with JNK and activated caspase- 3, a hallmark of apoptotic cell death. In CCRL 2 - deficient murine tissue, the level of activated caspase- 3 decreases to half of the level in wild-type tissue. Additionally, PI staining shows significantly less PI uptake in CCRL 2 KO tissue, denoting less cell death, suggesting CCRL 2 promotes cell death in ischemia.

40|$|Aphasia Imagine finding {{yourself}} all of {{a sudden}} alone in a Chinese city and not speaking or understanding Chinese. How do you ask for the way or read the signs, buy food and other necessities, watch tv or listen to the news, let alone have a social conversation with someone? This thought experiment might shed some light on how it must be for people to have a stroke and suddenly have lost the ability to communicate. The term aphasia is used to describe an acquired loss or impairment of the language system following brain damage. Damage to the brain can be caused by trauma, a tumor, infection or neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s disease. But the most frequent cause of aphasia is a stroke, mainly to the left hemisphere, where the language function of the brain is located in nearly all right-handed people and half of the left handers. In the Netherlands, approximately 40, 000 people per year experience a stroke. 1 About one-third of these patients develop aphasia, with higher frequencies in the early stages after stroke onset. It is estimated that there are about 30, 000 people with aphasia in the Netherlands (www. afasie. nl). The severity of aphasia varies from occasional word-finding di≤culties to having no means of communication at all. Individual aphasia profiles also vary regarding the degree of involvement of the modalities of language processing: speaking, comprehension of speech, writing and reading. A central problem for nearly all aphasic people is word finding, which requires intact semantic and phonological processing.

40|$|In Saskatchewan, stroke is {{the third}} {{leading cause of death}} as well was the major cause of adult disability. Once a person suffers a stroke or {{transient}} ischemic attack (TIA), they are at high risk for having a secondary (or recurrent) stroke. Despite this knowledge, secondary stroke prevention is often overlooked in the care of stroke/TIA patients. With the vision of decreasing the incidence and impact of stroke in Saskatchewan, the Saskatchewan Integrated Stroke Strategy (SISS) was recently implemented. The {{purpose of this study is}} to begin the development of an evaluation measurement system for the SISS based on the guidelines and measures from the Canadian Stroke Strategy (CSS) specifically pertaining to secondary stroke prevention. This multi-year cross-sectional study is an analysis of de-identified health data derived from linkage of administrative and laboratory data. Select indicators from the CSS Performance Measurement Manual involving medications use for secondary stroke prevention (antihypertensives, antilipidemics, anticoagulants) and intermediate health outcomes (serum LDL cholesterol, INR) are calculated. Regression is used to quantify the association of patient demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and geographic location of care with receipt of guideline-recommended secondary stroke prevention. The target population is Saskatchewan residents who have been hospitalized for a stroke or TIA between April 1, 2001 and March 31, 2008. The results of this study indicated that secondary stroke prevention in Saskatchewan is sub-optimal in the management of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. Although there has been some improvement over the time period, a significant number of patients are not taking the recommended medications at discharge from acute care. Similarly, a considerable number of patients are not receiving the appropriate laboratory tests within the year <b>following</b> their <b>stroke</b> <b>event.</b> Through regression analysis it was revealed that a number of correlates (ie. age, income, on medication before the <b>stroke</b> <b>event)</b> were significantly associated with receiving these specific elements of secondary stroke prevention, suggesting potential differences in provision of care. Finally, regional differences in secondary stroke prevention were found for a number of the outcomes, which may indicate differences in care throughout the province. The findings of this study serve as a baseline for evaluation of the impact of the Saskatchewan Integrated Stroke Strategy in the area of secondary stroke prevention. The results make apparent the fact that secondary stroke prevention in Saskatchewan can be improved, and that there is much opportunity for future research in this area...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In Switzerland {{there is}} a {{shortage}} of population-based information on stroke incidence and case fatalities (CF). The aim of this study was to estimate <b>stroke</b> <b>event</b> rates and both in- and out-of-hospital CF rates. METHODS: Data on stroke diagnoses, coded according to I 60 -I 64 (ICD 10), were taken from the Federal Hospital Discharge Statistics database (HOST) and the Cause of Death database (CoD) for the year 2004. The number of total <b>stroke</b> <b>events</b> and of age- and gender-specific and agestandardised event rates were estimated; overall CF, in-hospital and out-of-hospital, were determined. RESULTS: Among the overall number of 13 996 hospital discharges from stroke (HOST) the number was lower in women (n = 6736) than in men (n = 7260). A total of 3568 deaths (2137 women and 1431 men) due to stroke were recorded in the CoD database. The number of estimated <b>stroke</b> <b>events</b> was 15 733, and higher in women (n = 7933) than in men (n = 7800). Men presented significantly higher age-specific <b>stroke</b> <b>event</b> rates and a higher age-standardised event rate (178. 7 / 100 000 versus 119. 7 / 100 000). Overall CF rates were significantly higher for women (26. 9 %) than for men (18. 4 %). The same was true of out-of-hospital CF but not of in-hospital CF rates. CONCLUSION: The data on estimated <b>stroke</b> <b>events</b> obtained indicate that stroke discharge rate underestimates the <b>stroke</b> <b>event</b> rate. Out-of-hospital deaths from stroke accounted for the largest proportion of total stroke deaths. Sex differences in both number of total <b>stroke</b> <b>events</b> and deaths could be explained by the higher proportion of women than men aged 55 + in the Swiss population...|$|R

Obstacle {{crossing}} is compromised <b>following</b> <b>stroke.</b> The {{purpose of}} this study was to quantify modifications during obstacle clearance <b>following</b> <b>stroke.</b> Subjects. Twelve subjects with stroke and 12 subjects without stroke participated in the study. Methods. Kinematic variables were measured while participants crossed a 4 -cm-high obstacle. Subjects with stroke walked at a self-selected speed; subjects without stroke walked at a comparable speed and at a self-selected speed. Results. Several modifications were observed <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> with both groups walking at self-selected speeds. The affected lead limb was positioned closer to the obstacle before crossing. Affected trail-limb clearance over the obstacle was reduced. Both affected and unaffected lead and trail limbs landed closer to the obstacle after clearance. Swing time was increased in the affected lead limb after obstacle clearance. Fewer modifications were detected at matched walking speed; the trail limb still landed closer to the obstacle. Discussion and Conclusion. Modifications during obstacle crossing <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> may be partly related to walking speed. The findings raise issues of safety because people with stroke demonstrated reduced clearance of a 4 -cm obstacle and limb placement closer to the obstacle after clearance.

40|$|Systematic review Executive {{dysfunction}} {{is commonly}} reported <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> with most {{research in this}} area focused on frontal lobe lesions. A systematic review was carried out to evaluate the evidence of executive dysfunction <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> as compared to control groups. It was found that executive functions are consistently impaired <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> and is not limited to frontal lobe lesions. Processing speed, mental flexibility, attention and working memory impairments were found to be the most common executive functioning impairments <b>following</b> <b>stroke.</b> Given the impact executive dysfunction may have on successful rehabilitation, relationships, return to work and quality of life, a comprehensive assessment of such difficulties is important <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> to aid in the development of appropriate and effective rehabilitation strategies. Future research should use larger samples and a wide range of measures to assess different aspects of executive functioning. Introduction Mood disorders and psychological distress are common <b>following</b> <b>stroke,</b> and depression and emotional lability have been studied extensively. There has, however, been little research into difficulties in emotion regulation <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> and whether this is associated with emotional or cognitive difficulties. The current study investigated emotion regulation difficulties <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> and their relationship with quality of life, executive functions, anxiety and depression. Method Fifty participants who had suffered a stroke and forty five age matched controls completed the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment – Brief version and the National Adult Reading Test. In addition individuals with stroke completed four measures of executive functioning – Color Trails Test, Verbal Fluency, Brixton Spatial Anticipation Test and the Hayling Sentence Completion Test. Results Individuals with stroke had significantly greater difficulties in emotion regulation compared to age matched controls and this was significantly associated with lower self reported quality of life and increased levels of both anxiety and depression. No significant associations were found between emotion regulation and executive functions or between executive dysfunction and lower self reported quality of life. Discussion The current study found evidence that individuals who have suffered a stroke have more difficulties in emotion regulation than an age matched control group. This is clinically important as emotion regulation difficulties are found in mood disorders {{and it may be that}} such difficulties precipitate and/or maintain depression <b>following</b> <b>stroke.</b> The absence of an association between difficulties in emotion regulation and executive functioning suggests that other factors may influence such difficulties, such as the trauma of having a stroke. Future research should explore emotion regulation difficulties further <b>following</b> <b>stroke,</b> particularly investigating whether the course of these difficulties changes over time and if they are linked to type of stroke or lesion location...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Valuable {{information}} on the determinants of non-fatal stroke {{can be obtained from}} longitudinal observational cohort studies. Such studies often rely on self-reported <b>stroke</b> <b>events,</b> which are best validated with external medical evidence. The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare the {{information on}} incident non-fatal <b>stroke</b> <b>events</b> arising from different sources. Methods We carried out a validation of self-reported stoke events among participants in the Whitehall II Study, a large UK based cohort study (baseline sample size 10, 308 men and women). Results 106 <b>stroke</b> <b>events</b> were self-reported in three self-administered questionnaires between 2002 and 2009. Eight (7. 5 %) of these events were discarded as false positives after medical review, 66 were validated by information from the NHS Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database in England, 16 by manual searches of hospital records alone, and 12 by letters from general practitioners alone. HES provided information on an additional (i. e. not self-reported) 47 <b>events</b> coded as <b>stroke</b> during the period 2002 to 2009 in hospitals in England among the original baseline participants. Of these, 43 participants were no longer active in the study and 4 had completed questionnaires but not reported a <b>stroke</b> <b>event.</b> Conclusions Validating self-reported strokes in cohort studies with information from the NHS HES database was efficient and provided information on probable non-fatal <b>stroke</b> <b>events</b> among cohort members no longer in active follow-up. Manual extraction from hospital notes can provide supplementary information beyond that available in the HES discharge summary and was used to sub-type some strokes. However, the process was labour intensive. Multiple sources are needed to capture maximum information on <b>stroke</b> <b>events</b> but increasingly with hospitalisation in the acute phase of stroke, HES has an important role. Further development of HES is required to assure validity and coverage. </p...|$|R

Despite the high prevalence and devastating outcome of ischemic stroke, there remain few options for treatment <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> onset. The treatments {{that are currently}} available remain limited both in the time window <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> {{in which they are}} effective, as well as their success in ameliorating stroke injury in the brain and limiting functional impairment. Current therapies for stroke, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) are only effective up to 4. 5 hours <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> onset. We have tested a human umbilical cord blood-derived stem cell line that has shown both a significant reduction in stroke infarct volume as well as improved functional recovery <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> in the rat when administered 48 hours <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> onset. In the present study we have compared high vs. low passage non-hematopoietic umbilical cord blood stem cells (nh-UCBSCs) to determine whether highly expanded nh-UCBSCs are as therapeutically effective as low passaged cells, and their mechanisms of action. Using the middle cerebral arterial occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke in Sprague-Dawley rats, we administered nh-UCBSC by intra-venous administration two days <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> induction. These human cells were injected into rats without any immune suppression, and no adverse reactions were detected. Both behavioral and histological analyses have shown that the administration of these cells reduces the infarct volume by 50 % as well as improve the functional outcome of these rats <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> for both high and low passaged nh-UCBSC. The brain transcriptome was compared between normal rats, and those with ischemic brain injury, and injury with nh-UCBSC treatment using next generation RNAseq analysis. Differences in the brain transcriptome revealed that ischemic brain injury was associated with significant increases in transcripts related to macrophage, T cell, and microglia function. Flow cytometry analysis of immune cells present in the brains of animals, in each of these three groups, confirmed infiltration of macrophages and T cells consequent to ischemia reduction to normal levels with nh-UCBSC treatment. Flow cytometry also revealed a restoration of normal levels of microglia in the brain following treatment. Overall, these data show a blunting of immune cell migration and activation that are typically activated in the brain <b>following</b> <b>stroke,</b> suggesting that nh-UCBSCs may act by inhibiting immune cell migration into the brain from the periphery, and possibly by inhibition of immune cell activation within the brain.

As the burden of disability <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> is unpredictable, a need exists to identify the causative biomarkers so that individualized post-ischemic stroke treatment regimens could be developed (VanGilder et al. 2014).|$|R

40|$|Stroke is {{currently}} {{one of the}} leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Despite recent advances in the treatment of stroke there is a major unmet clinical need for novel therapeutics for intervention. miRNAs are small coding RNAs which act to post-transcriptionally inhibit expression of genes. Emerging evidence has supported the view that miRNAs {{play an important role in}} the development and progression of ischaemic stroke, although understanding remains relatively poor. This research uses several models to investigate the effects of miRNAs in the context of stroke in vivo and in vitro, as well as assessment of patient serum samples in order to identify biomarkers for stroke. miR- 29 b was found to be significantly upregulated in SHRSP rat brain peri-infarct at 72 h <b>following</b> <b>stroke,</b> and downregulated in ischaemic core at 24 h and 72 h <b>following</b> <b>stroke,</b> whilst miR- 29 c was significantly downregulated in remainder tissue at 24 h <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> and in infarct at 72 h <b>following</b> <b>stroke.</b> The upreglation of miR- 29 b at 72 h corresponded to a significant downregulation of miR- 29 target genes MMP 2, MMP 9 and TGF-β 1 in peri-infarct tissue at 72 h <b>following</b> <b>stroke.</b> Modulation of miR- 29 b and miR- 29 c was achieved in a rat neuronal cell line but suppression of genes of interest was not observed following oxygen glucose deprivation. Several candidate miRNAs were then identified by microRNA Openarray analysis in stroke patient serum samples. Validation of these miRNAs was not demonstrated in the population studied, but assessment of these miRNAs in rat serum and isolated exosomes demonstrated that several of these miRNAs were significantly altered in SHRSP rats <b>following</b> <b>stroke.</b> Finally miR- 21 was demonstrated to be significantly upregulated in SHRSP rat peri-infarct <b>following</b> <b>stroke.</b> This was associated with a change in miR- 21 localization as determined by in situ hybridization. Modulation of miR- 21 via the use of CAG-miR- 21 mice demonstrated no difference in infarct size as measured by T 2 -weighted MRI scan nor was any difference present in behavioural tests versus wild type. KO of miR- 21 resulted in a reduction of survival rate compared with wild type. This thesis demonstrates that miR- 29 and miR- 21 are modulated <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> in animal models, and these are potential candidates for therapeutic intervention in the future. Analysis of clinical samples has illustrated difficulties in the identification of serum miRNA profiles and suggests that looking at the exosomal component of serum may provide better information regarding miRNA profiles after stroke...|$|R
