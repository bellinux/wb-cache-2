500|$|Andrew Orloff, the Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor of Zoic Studios, {{considered}} the creature {{one of the}} most challenging effects his company helped make for the season. He explained that this and other designed monsters are [...] "really super fantastical, they’re really out there, the anatomy and the biology of them is so wild and crazy, that it really takes a lot to make it look real in the scene and make it a part of the actors are reacting to these things – to get the audience to believe in it is kind of the biggest challenge we’ve faced on the show so far." [...] During filming, the cast and crew referred to the monster as a [...] "were-upine" [...] or [...] "porcuman". Lance Reddick commented on set, [...] "When I <b>first</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> tonight, I was expecting zombies to come up out of the ground. And the actual creature looks so bizarre, I mean it really looks like something I wouldn't want to be caught in the woods with." [...] The crew spent over a week collecting and placing the plane wreckage together. According to Set Dresser Russ Griffin, the set included approximately 15,000 pounds worth of plane parts.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, well, we'll {{forget the}} past," [...] he said, [...] "all but what we've {{done to help}} one another. You stood by me off Hatteras, and I've been of some service to you here. You {{know how it is}} in our calling, Daggett; first come, <b>first</b> served.

6000|$|... "Of course, {{it was he}} who had got me the appointment. He {{was very}} kind, and told me that I could not join until after this trial; so that I could go down home, and stop there, till today; and the admiral sent me {{straight}} off, to be measured for my uniform. When I started, next day, he gave me a letter to my father--an awfully nice letter it was, saying that he intended to present me with my <b>first</b> outfit. I <b>got</b> <b>here</b> about an hour ago, and have been putting on my uniform, to see how it fitted." ...|$|R

Mulvey has been {{particular}} friendly to me an' I've nursed him along, 'cept I wouldn't drink. An' his pards have been particular friends with me, too, more an' more as I loosened up. You see, they was shy of me when I <b>first</b> <b>got</b> <b>here.</b> To-day the whole deal showed clear to me like a hoof track in soft ground. Bud Lewis, who's bunked with me, come out an' tried to win me over to Beasley--soon as Auchincloss dies. I palavered with Bud an' I wanted to know. But Bud would only say he was goin' along with Jeff an' others of the outfit. I told him I'd reckon over it an' let him know. He thinks I'll come round." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that was}} a bit of luck, as a matter of fact. When I <b>first</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> you know, it seemed to me the only thing to do was to round up a merry old detective and put the matter in his hands, like they do in stories. You know. Ring at the bell. 'And this, if I mistake not, Watson, is my client now.' And then in breezes client and spills the plot. I found a sleuth in the {{classified}} telephone directory, and toddled round. Rummy chaps, detectives! Ever met any? I always thought they were lean, hatchet-faced Johnnies with inscrutable smiles. This one looked just like my old Uncle Ted, the one who died of apoplexy. Jovial, puffy-faced bird, who kept bobbing up behind a fat cigar. Have you ever noticed what whacking big cigars these fellows over here smoke? Rummy country, America. You ought to have seen the way this blighter could shift his cigar right across his face with moving his jaw-muscles. Like a flash! Most remarkable thing you ever saw, I give you my honest word!

Hurricanes coach Randy Shannon decided to move Brown from weakside to inside linebacker for his sophomore season, saying he began flourishing in the new role {{toward the end of}} the 2008 season. [...] "The last two weeks of the season he was phenomenal at middle linebacker on scout team. Like Ray Lewis, when he <b>first</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> he was outside and he wasn't very good," [...] said Shannon.|$|E

5000|$|After {{having to}} bypass the field drills at the 2007 NFL combine and Ohio State's {{official}} pro day due to a lingering foot injury suffered in the 2007 BCS Title Game, Ginn reportedly ran between 4.37 and 4.45 in a private workout for NFL Scouts held on April 12, 2007. [...] Preceding the workout {{it was reported that}} a healthy Ginn had been timed as great as 4.28 in individual team drills during his tenure at Ohio State. In addition, in a 2007 interview with Stack Magazine while discussing his own personal improvement in the 40 yard dash, Ginn himself suggests that he had been timed at a personal best of 4.22 in the 40 yard dash. In the interview, while discussing his improvement since training at one of Tim Robertson's facilities, Ginn states [...] "...as far as my running, it's changed me a lot. When I <b>first</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> I was running like a 5.1 40, 5.2 40 to a 4.22".|$|E

5000|$|Zayat Stables then {{switched}} Pioneerof the Nile to trainer Bob Baffert, {{with whom}} they had split with earlier in the year. [...] "There's nothing like a good horse to help smooth over some of those hurt feelings," [...] Baffert said. Ironically, Midshipman, with whom Baffert had won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, was taken off of him and given to another trainer the same month as he was given Pioneerof the Nile. Pioneerof the Nile's first start for Baffert came in the CashCall Futurity, on December 20th at Hollywood Park. He started as the 1.40 favorite against a field 11 other two-year-olds. He broke evenly, and settled in fifth, about eight lengths off the lead. He moved up to third before the far turn, and then unleashed a determined rally and battled with I Want Revenge to win by a head, with a final time of 1:41.95 for 1 1/16 miles. After the race, Baffert stated: “When he <b>first</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> I {{was trying to figure}} him out and was trying different things with him. When Bill Mott sent him he was in great shape. It was a pretty good Christmas gift there. When he makes the lead, he wants to pull himself up. When he made the lead today, he started doing that, but as soon as that horse came to him, then he dug right back in again. We wanted to win by further than that, but he made it close." [...] His jockey, Garrett Gomez, said: [...] "When they slowed down I caught up and then I shut him down and just sat there for a minute. They told me in the paddock he's still a bit green and likes to wait on horses. But that's a good thing because he's got {{a lot of room for}} improvement. When he saw that other horse (I Want Revenge) coming on the inside he really dug in. If we had gone around again I don't think the other horse was going to go by him." ...|$|E

40|$|Ten years ago, I {{arrived at}} the Indianapolis airport to begin my {{doctoral}} studies in the United States.

However, quite a few of my original questions still persist. Actually, many of the questions I came to answer have changed and evolved. On top of those, I have managed to add quite a few more to my 1991 list.
