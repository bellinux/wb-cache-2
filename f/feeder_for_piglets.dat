40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the <b>feeders</b> <b>for</b> {{removable}} <b>piglets.</b> The cleaning process of feeding trough by the rotor cleaner with hinge-fixed blades has been studied. The purposes are {{to improve the}} sanitary-hygienic conditions of feeding of removable piglets, to decrease the feed losses and the labour expenditure {{at the expense of}} improvement of frame and of feeder with cleaner. The initial data to create the effective equipment for feeding of removable piglets have been grounded. The analytical expressions to calculate the main characteristics of cleaner have been offered. The mathematical simulator of cleaning process of feeders has been obtained. The degree of influence of different factors on the cleaning quality of feeding troughs has been detected, the rational characteristics of cleaner have been grounded. The set of equipment has been introduced in the Pankratovski Farm, Penza Region. The computer program is used in the educational process of undernamed Academy.

40|$|Laboratory and in-barn {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to study the thermal characteristics of electrical heat mats for creep heating in swine farrowing crates. An infrared imager {{was used to evaluate}} the surface temperature distribution and controllability of four commercial heat mats under constant environmental conditions. The effects of pig resting behavior on surface temperature distribution of the heat mat were elucidated by in-barn tests. Embedded temperature sensors facilitated the controllability of mat surface temperature. If either designed or operated improperly, electrical heat mats could contain hot spots (3 ̆e 43 °C or 109 °F), which would greatly reduce the effective usable mat area <b>for</b> <b>piglets.</b> When piglets were lying on the mat with embedded temperature sensors, mat surface temperature rose in the occupied region and declined in the unoccupied region. The temperature difference between the two regions ranged from 7 to 12 °C (13 to 22 °F). Temperature feedback control maintained the mat temperature in a comfortable range <b>for</b> <b>piglets.</b> By comparison, a mat without temperature feedback control could become excessively hot (3 ̆e 43 °C or 109 °F) <b>for</b> <b>piglets...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{survey of}} 68 integrated Irish pig farms {{was conducted to}} determine the prevalence and risk factors for foot and limb lesions in 2948 piglets from 272 litters. One litter was selected per age category; 3 – 7 days, 8 – 14 days, 15 – 21 days and 22 – 28 days per farm. All <b>piglets</b> were examined <b>for</b> sole bruising, sole erosion, coronary band injuries, limb abrasions, alopecia, swollen limbs and swollen feet and scored from 0 to 3 based on relative size. Environmental parameters were recorded for each litter examined. A questionnaire was completed on management, health and performance factors for each farm. The overall prevalence of each lesion was calculated and multilevel mixed effect logistic regression models were used to elucidate risk factors. The prevalence (farm range) of lesions were: sole bruising = 61. 5 % (7 – 100 %), sole erosion = 34. 1 % (0 – 100 %), coronary band injuries = 11. 3 % (0 – 46 %), limb abrasions = 55. 7 % (11 – 98 %), alopecia = 24. 8 % (0 – 83 %), swollen limbs = 2. 4 % (0 – 11 %) and swollen feet = 4. 4 % (0 – 14 %). Age was negatively associated with sole bruising (OR 0. 42; CI 0. 37, 0. 50) and coronary band injury (OR 0. 69; CI 0. 60, 0. 81) and positively associated with limb abrasions (OR 1. 54; CI 1. 12, 2. 14). There was a reduced risk of sole bruising in piglets in pens with plastic slats with oval voids in the piglet area of the pen with a plastic solid area <b>for</b> <b>piglets</b> and metal slats under the crate (OR 0. 32; CI 0. 15, 0. 70) compared with plastic stats throughout and a plastic solid area <b>for</b> <b>piglets.</b> There was {{an increased risk of}} sole erosion (OR 1. 81; CI 1. 07, 3. 09) and foot and limb swellings (OR 1. 90; CI 1. 01, 3. 57) in pigs in pens with metal slats only and a solid plastic area <b>for</b> <b>piglets</b> compared with plastic stats throughout and a solid plastic area <b>for</b> <b>piglets.</b> There was an increased risk of coronary band injury in pens with metal slats throughout and a metal solid area <b>for</b> <b>piglets</b> (OR 4. 25; CI 1. 96, 3. 57) compared with plastic stats throughout and a plastic solid area <b>for</b> <b>piglets.</b> We conclude no single floor type was ideal <b>for</b> <b>piglet</b> foot and limb health with all floors influencing different lesions in different ways, however, the positive association between sole erosions, coronary band injury and foot and limb swellings and metal slats suggest that this floor type was most detrimental and most likely to be associated with joint infections that lead to severe health and welfare concerns...|$|R

No differences were found for nursing (P = 0. 69), active (P = 0. 52), inactive (P = 0. 59) or unknown (P = 0. 78) <b>for</b> <b>piglets</b> that were killed or not killed over the first 72 -h after parturition. In conclusion there were no differences in the behavioral repertoire performed by outdoor loose housed piglets that resulted in their death by crushing over the first 72 -h after parturition. Therefore, finding few behavioral differences between treatments may indicate that variation among sow behavior is a more significant cause of piglet rushing than variation among piglet behaviors...|$|R
