50|$|Slow Continuous Ultrafiltration (SCUF) is an {{artificial}} method which approximately mimics the ultrafiltration {{function of the}} kidneys. SCUF is a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) generally used to remove fluid from fluid overloaded patients suffering acute renal failure. During SCUF blood {{is removed from the}} body and is passed through an extracorporeal circuit through a <b>hemofilter</b> and a predetermined percentage of plasma water is removed based upon a prescription. Typically, no more than 2 liters an hour of fluid is removed. The remaining blood is returned to the patient. Unlike hemodialysis, hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration, no dialysate or replacement fluids are used in SCUF.|$|E
50|$|Hemofiltration or {{ultrafiltration}} devices {{constitute the}} third major type of blood salvage in operating rooms. In general, ultrafiltration devices filter the patient's anticoagulated whole blood. The filter process removes unwanted excess non-cellular plasma water, {{low molecular weight}} solutes, platelet inhibitors and some particulate matter through hemoconcentration, including activated cytokines, anaphylatoxins, and other waste substances making concentrated whole blood available for reinfusion. <b>Hemofilter</b> devices return the patient's whole blood with all the blood elements and fractions including platelets, clotting factors, and plasma proteins with a substantial Hb level. Presently, the only whole blood ultrafiltration device in clinical use is the Hemobag. These devices do not totally remove potentially harmful contaminants that can be washed away by most RBC-savers. However, the contaminants that are potentially reduced by using RBC-savers, as shown by data from in vitro laboratory tests, are transient and reversible in vivo with hemostatic profiles returning to baselines within hours. The key is that coagulation and homeostasis are immediately improved {{with the return of}} concentrated autologous whole blood.|$|E

30|$|Introduction Continuous veno-venous {{haemofiltration}} (CVVH) is used {{to treat}} acute kidney injury in critically ill patients. To optimize its efficiency, CVVH requires effective anticoagulation. Systemic anticoagulation with standard heparin, the most used, can lead to major bleeding complications. <b>Hemofilters</b> {{that are able to}} adsorb heparin molecules on their surface such as AN 69 ST and oXiris membranes represent an alternative. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare these two types of filters in terms of duration, efficiency, dysfunctions and cost.|$|R
40|$|To {{prove the}} {{clinically}} feasibility {{of a new}} high cut-off <b>hemofilter</b> a pilot study on septic patient with acute renail failure were conductet and part of this work. All patients were in septic shock and had multiorgan failure {{with the need for}} renal replacement therapy. The safety of the new <b>hemofilter</b> with the haemodynamic stability of the patients, the transmembrane loss of plasma proteins and the coagulation parameters were in the first place of the investigation. The high cut-off <b>hemofilter</b> was well tolerated and safe in clinically practise. There was a positive impact on immunomodulatory properties. The phagocytotic activity of polymorphnuclear leukocytes and monocytes were decreased as well as the MODS-Score of the patients. Furthermore the renal function was positivly influenced by the new <b>hemofilter.</b> The mediator elimination capacity for the tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was poor. But there was the ability of the new <b>hemofilter</b> to eleminate mediators, which influence the release of TNF-alpha in mononuclear cells as well as the phagocytotic activity...|$|E
30|$|A {{measure of}} {{the total amount of}} PS-exposing MV, i.e., MV {{activity}} (Fig.  1 e), revealed a statistically significant decrease during <b>hemofilter</b> [0.088 (0.027 – 0.243) vs. 0.067 (0.021 – 0.223) nmol/min; p =  0.002]. The comparison of TF levels (Fig.  1 g) before and after the <b>hemofilter</b> showed a significant decrease after the <b>hemofilter</b> [27877 (22103 – 37793) vs. 25811 (18736 – 35164) pg/min, (p =  0.0376) pg/min; p =  0.0093)]. No significant correlation was detected between FF and alterations in MV activity, TF activity or TF level.|$|E
30|$|Interestingly, {{we found}} {{correlations}} between FF and increments of platelet- and presumably leukocyte-derived {{as well as}} procoagulant AnnexinV+ MV. The usually recommended FF is below 25 % in postdilution mode [22], since higher FF frequently leads to <b>hemofilter</b> clotting [5]. As shown in Fig.  2, the induction of MV generation within the <b>hemofilter</b> {{seems to be more}} pronounced when FF is above 30 %, probably due to increased shear stress at higher FF. This prominent effect at higher FF seems even to apply to platelet-derived and AnnexinV+ MV which did not significantly change in septic patients overall. We speculate that the generation of MV within the <b>hemofilter</b> might contribute to <b>hemofilter</b> clotting occurring when high FF is applied. However, this remains to be investigated in a larger study.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} adjusted-dose unfractionated heparin with that of regional citrate anticoagulation in intensive care patients treated by continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). Design and setting: Prospective, randomized, clinical trial in a 32 -bed medical and surgical ICU in a university teaching hospital. Patients: ICU patients with acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy, without cirrhosis, severe coagulopathy, or known sensitivity to heparin. Interventions: Before the first CVVH run patients were randomized to receive anticoagulation with heparin or trisodium citrate. Patients eligible for another CVVH run received the other study medication in a crossover fashion until the fourth circuit. Measurements and results: Fortynine circuits (<b>hemofilters)</b> were analyzed: 23 with heparin and 26 with citrate. The median lifetime of <b>hemofilters</b> was 70 h (interquartile range 44 – 140) with citrate anticoagulation and 40 h (17 – 48) with heparin (p= 0. 0007). One major bleeding occurred during heparin anticoagulation and one metabolic alkalosis (pH= 7. 60) was noted with citrate after a protocol violation. Transfusion rates (units of red cells per day of CVVH) were, respectively, 0. 2 (0. 0 – 0. 4) with citrate and 1. 0 (0. 0 – 2. 0) with heparin (p= 0. 0008).

30|$|In conclusion, CVVH clears a {{fraction}} of small PS-exposing MV by mechanisms other than filtration, but does not eliminate larger MV. CVVH induces the release of CD 31 +/CD 41 − MV that indicate leukocyte activation during <b>hemofilter</b> passage in septic patients. The generation of MV within the <b>hemofilter</b> seems to be particularly pronounced when FF is above 30 %, which supports the clinical relevance of the usual recommendation to keep FF below 25 %. A fraction of TF is being cleared by CVVH via ultrafiltration. Our findings show that MV analysis {{can be used to}} assess the effects caused by contact of blood with the <b>hemofilter.</b> Evaluation of MV patterns might be a promising instrument helping to refine extracorporeal therapeutic systems and biocompatibility of <b>hemofilter</b> membranes in future.|$|E
30|$|A major {{strength}} of our study is that we assessed alterations in MV levels occurring directly and exclusively within the <b>hemofilter.</b> Limitations of the study are the {{relatively small number of}} patients as well as the lack of information concerning kinetics in the extracorporeal system or the systemic circulation because we did not take serial measurements due to the complexity of analysis. Since no conclusion can be drawn regarding whether the generation of CD 31 +/CD 41 − MV within the <b>hemofilter</b> may impact systemic levels or patient outcome, the clinical implications of MV generation within the <b>hemofilter</b> remain to be further elucidated.|$|E
30|$|Despite {{clearing}} {{a fraction}} of small PS-exposing MV CVVH does not eliminate larger MV. Concurrently, CVVH induces the release of CD 31 +/CD 4 − MV that indicate leukocyte activation during <b>hemofilter</b> passage in septic patients. Increments of several MV subtypes within the <b>hemofilter</b> correlate with FF, which supports common recommendations to keep FF low.

40|$|Gentamicin and {{phenytoin}} sieving through hollow–fiber polysulfone <b>hemofilters.</b> The sieving {{characteristics of}} the prototype drugs gentamicin (poorly protein bound) and phenytoin (highly protein bound) were measured in vitro using polysulfone capillary <b>hemofilters</b> {{similar to those used}} in clinical continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration. Plasma water, whole plasma, and whole blood were the solvent systems used with variable drug concentrations and solvent flow rates. Our results indicate that the sieving coefficients for both drugs can be accurately defined as the concentration in the ultrafiltrate divided by the concentration in the artery. This correlates with a more rigorously derived expression by Colton and Henderson (r = 0. 98, P < 0. 00001 for both drugs) and avoids the necessity of measuring venous concentrations. Drug sieving in the three solvents followed expectations from known protein–binding data and was independent of solvent flow rate. For both drugs, at higher drug concentrations sieving increased in plasma, consistent with the saturation of protein–binding sites. In whole blood, sieving fell for both drugs with increasing drug concentrations, consistent with drug compartmentalization into red blood cells. Although these sieving changes with increasing drug concentrations were statistically significant, their clinical significance is doubtful. Phenytoin sieving in plasma was increased by the addition offree fatty acids, consistent with a protein–drug displacement effect. There appears to be a real, but small, effect of protein concentration polarization, protein–membrane and drug–membrane interactions on drug sieving. Our observations are consistent with the expectation that the major determinant of drug sieving is the extent of drug–protein binding...|$|R

The modified cellulose used was a Sureflux 150 E (cellulose triacetate) and the standard synthetic membranes used was an AV- 400. Blood and replacement flow rate were kept at 100 and 20 mL/min, respectively. Ultrafiltraion rate was 1, 200 mL/hr.

Sureflux 150 E and AV- 400 provided comparable values of sieving coefficients and clearances of small solutes. The albumin loss in ultrafiltrate by Sureflux 150 E was greater than AV- 400.

40|$|We used an {{in vitro}} model of {{continuous}} venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) to characterize amikacin adsorption by polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and polyamide filters. A blood-crystalloid mixture dosed with amikacin was pumped from a reservoir through a hemofiltration circuit {{and back to}} the reservoir. All ultrafiltrate was also returned to the reservoir. The level of adsorption was calculated from the fall in the amikacin concentration. The dose and the initial concentration of amikacin were varied, as were the pH, the type of <b>hemofilter,</b> and the <b>hemofilter</b> surface area. The reversibility of adsorption and the effect of repeated dosing were also studied. The level of adsorption by 0. 6 -m 2 PAN filters was significantly greater than that by 0. 6 -m 2 polyamide filters. Adsorption was increased by increasing the dose of amikacin even when the initial concentration was unchanged. It was unaffected by the pH (pH 6. 8 or 7. 4) or the <b>hemofilter</b> surface area (0. 6 m 2 or 0. 9 m 2). Repeated doses of amikacin resulted in further adsorption. In a saturation experiment, the maximum adsorptive capacity of 0. 6 -m 2 PAN hemofilters was at least 546. 9 mg (range, 427. 6 to 577. 5 mg). The adsorption of amikacin by hemofilters is irreversible and was associated with the dose and the <b>hemofilter</b> material but not the <b>hemofilter</b> surface area.

40|$|Abstract Widely used {{nowadays}} hemodialysis and hemofiltration cannot replace completely the excretory function of human kidneys {{in the natural}} conditions of physiological regulation. The aim of our study is to develop and create a new method and apparatus for CRF patients «symbiotic» compensation, based on hemofiltration and healthy humans kidneys natural physiological functions, excluding mixing of partners blood. Method of «symbiotic» hemofiltration is based on mutual exchange of equivalent blood ultrafiltrate volumes between healthy person and CRF patient, needed to be cleansed from metabolites. During exchange procedure patient’s and a healthy person’s circulations are separated by <b>hemofilters</b> excluding blood mixing. During CRF patient’s blood cleansing from metabolic products separate hemofiltration of healthy donor and CRF patient in equal volumes is processed. Patient’s blood ultrafiltrate enters the bloodstream of a healthy person, as a healthy person ultrafiltrate in the same extent enters the bloodstream of CRF patient. At the same time remaining after filtration blood components of donor and patient are returned in their bloodstream respectively.

40|$|Background/Aim: Substances in {{the middle}} {{molecular}} weight range {{have been shown to}} play a significant pathogenetic role in as diverse disorders as end-stage renal disease and multiple organ failure. To overcome the limitations in the amount removed by <b>hemofilters,</b> new sorbents with a high biocompatibility are actively being developed. Furthermore, biocompatible sorbents by their nonspecific adsorptive behavior could have great impact on detoxification treatment in exogenous intoxications. We performed an in vitro evaluation of a newly developed highly biocompatible sorbent cartridge (Betasorb(R)), examining its adsorptive capacity concerning therapeutic drugs. Methods: Uremic blood spiked with a range of therapeutic drugs was recirculated for 2 h in an in vitro hemoperfusion circuit containing a Betasorb device for hemoperfusion. The drug concentrations before and after the passage of the cartridge were measured, and the total amount removed was calculated. Results: The sorbent showed effective removal of glycopeptide antibiotics, digoxin, theophylline, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid. Moderate removal could be demonstrated for tacrolimus and cyclosporine A; aminoglycosides were removed to a small extent only. Conclusions: Betasorb hemoperfusion shows a potent adsorptive capacity concerning therapeutic drugs (except aminoglycosides) and could be of major value in the treatment of intoxications. On the other hand, drug monitoring and possible adjustments are necessary during Betasorb hemoperfusion to maintain the therapeutic ranges of the drugs in blood. Copyright (C) 2002 S.

40|$|Hirudin {{elimination}} by hemofiltration: A comparative {{in vitro}} study of different membranes. BackgroundRecombinant hirudin (r-hirudin) {{is a highly}} specific and selective thrombin inhibitor. Since 1997, it has been approved {{for the treatment of}} heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT type II). Renal function impairment drastically prolongs the elimination half-life time. In cases of bleeding or overdosage, there is currently no antidote available. Hemofiltration has been reported to be useful in r-hirudin elimination. In this study, we determined sieving coefficients (SCs) and drug clearances for two different <b>hemofilters</b> currently used in clinical medicine and intensive care. MethodsWe developed an in vitro postdilution hemofiltration model using 500 ml heparinized (2 IU unfractionated heparin/ml) fresh human blood and bicarbonate substitution fluid. The investigated membranes were high-flux polysulfone F 50 (1. 0 m 2, Fresenius) and AN 69 Nephral 200 (1. 05 m 2, Hospal Cobe). After equilibration, a bolus of Lepirudin was injected into the postfilter port to achieve a r-hirudin blood level of approximately 15 μg/ml. Serial blood and ultrafiltrate samples were taken for the determination of hirudin levels (chromogenic assay) and control parameters. SC and clearances were calculated according to standard formulae. ResultsThe observed SCs and clearances differed significantly between F 50 and Nephral 200 (0. 60 ± 0. 17 and 21. 0 ± 5. 9 ml/min, respectively, vs. 0. 44 ± 0. 09 and 15. 5 ± 3. 0 ml/min, respectively; P = 0. 001). The determination of prothrombin fragments showed no coagulation activation during the experiments. The hematocrit values remained stable. ConclusionsOur data show that r-hirudin can be eliminated by hemofiltration. The elimination obviously depends on the membrane material with high-flux polysulfone being more effective than AN 69. These findings may be important in cases of overdosage and for r-hirudin dosage guidelines in continuous hemofiltration...|$|R

40|$|Development of {{increasingly}} complex perfusion devices with bonded heparin allowed for significant improvement of thromboresistance of most basic components required for cardiopulmonary bypass. In his recent review of heparin-coated cardiopulmonary bypass circuits, Gravlee cited 91 references dealing with heparin-coated surfaces, {{and far more}} can be found if the search includes material technology or heparin-coated devices not designed for cardiopulmonary bypass (eg, ventricular assist devices, <b>hemofilters,</b> catheters). The present review is focused on long-term application of heparin-coated equipment in conjunction with basic work on heparin bonding relevant for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Experimental open chest cardiopulmonary bypass using heparin-coated equipment without systemic heparinization up to 36 hours has shown improved thromboresistance, and better platelet preservation was demonstrated for perfusion with heparin-coated cardiopulmonary bypass equipment up to 5 days in the experimental set-up. Similar findings were reported for roller pump perfusion with heparin-coated tubing and centrifugal pump perfusion with heparin-coated pump heads. More recently, heparin bonding was also made available for oxygenators with true membranes that preclude plasma leakage. The available knowledge on clinical applications of heparin-coated perfusion equipment is mainly based on short-term applications like ours, which now includes more than 300 patients. Reduced postoperative blood loss {{and as a result}} fewer transfusions were the main benefits of heparin-coated equipment allowing for perfusion with low systemic heparinization. There are only a few reports on long-term use of heparin-coated equipment for prolonged circulatory support. However, the longest clinical application of a single device is that of an intravascular gas exchanger that remained fully functional during a 29 -day implantation period. Finally, it appears, that circulating protamine interacts with surface-bound heparin. Protamine administration should therefore be avoided during perfusion with heparin-bonded equipment to maintain the improved thromboresistance...|$|R
30|$|At first glance, high {{permeability}} hemofiltration (HPHF) or even high-volume hemofiltration (HVHF) seem to {{be attractive}} alternatives to classical CRRT. Removal of higher molecular weight mediators is greatly enhanced by HPHF [90]. Since the early 1990 s, it has been advocated that reducing cytokine levels in the blood compartment could theoretically lower mortality. Reducing the unbound cytokine load was logically assumed to limit remote organ damage, hence reducing overall mortality. However, recent insight in cytokine pharmacokinetics shows {{that this is an}} oversimplified generalization of a far more complex process, because it neglects the possible effects that changes in blood cytokines might have at the interstitial and tissue level [91]. In this setting, techniques promoting rapid and substantial removal of mediators are privileged. Such techniques include (very) HVHF as well as HPHF [92, 93], super high flux hemofiltration (SHFHF), hemadsorption, and coupled plasma filtration and adsorption (CPFA) [94]. Because the clinical effectiveness of blood purification techniques could not be explained by a concomitant decline in blood mediator levels [95], interest shifted to the effects of HVHF at the interstitial and tissue level. Unfortunately, {{it is almost impossible to}} measure interstitial mediator levels and, as such, to quantify how HVHF interacts with the immune-inflammatory pathways to produce the observed significant dynamic changes in tissues and interstitium. Indirect evidence of a link between mediator level and subsequent tissue damage should consist of their therapeutic removal to a threshold value at which destructive inflammation is abated. Furthermore, the mechanism facilitating mediator and cytokine flow from the interstitial to the blood compartment during HVHF is unclear. The use of large replacement volumes for HVHF could promote and enhance lymphatic flow from the interstitium to the blood. Lymphatic flow can increase 20 - to 40 -fold when large fluid volumes (3 to 5 l/h) are infused [96]. Thus, the high fluid volume exchange in HVHF increases lymphatic flow, which directs mediators and cytokines to the blood compartment where they are subsequently removed, whereas HPHF, although able to remove larger amounts of mediators and cytokines from the blood, lacks the ability to influence processes outside the blood compartment. Of note is that increasing filter porosity might be a potentially effective method, because mediators have higher molecular weights than the cut-off points of conventional <b>hemofilters</b> [97]. In this respect, a recent study using a high cut-off (60 kilodaltons (kDa)) filter showed promising results [53]. Apparently, this is in contrast with HVHF and derived techniques, which address clearance of molecules below 45 kDa and with plasma filtration that targets molecules around 900 kDa. It is imperative to further develop methods that modulate the mediator spectrum between these two extremes [54]. Whether this technique may cause unwarranted loss of beneficial nutrients, hormones and drugs (e.g., antibiotics) is unclear. Large RCTs applying specifically designed high cut-off <b>hemofilters</b> are expected to explore this aspect of HPHF. Potential side-effects due to the undesired loss of vital substances could eventually be circumvented by the recently described hybrid techniques, such as CPFA and cascade hemofiltration (CCHF) [98]. Only target molecules within a relatively strict range of molecular weight are adsorbed and treated blood is returned to the patient. Except for one small study regarding safety [55], no large RCT has compared classic membranes with membranes exhibiting large pores, such as SepteX® (Gambro™). A new generation of membranes has emerged that focuses on endotoxin adsorption (Toraymyxin®; Toray™ or Oxiris®; Gambro™) or specific immuno-adsorption (Prosorba®; Fresenius™). Preliminary results are promising [56], and future large RCTs are being prepared. As alluded in recent reviews, a more in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of blood purification removal is needed [99 – 101]. Finally, the type of vasopressor used for resuscitation may have an impact on apoptosis. During well-resuscitated septic shock after porcine peritonitis, low-dose arginine vasopressin is associated with less kidney damage by reducing both tubular apoptosis and systemic inflammation compared with noradrenaline [102].|$|R

Intervention: Patients were randomized to receive either convective clearance using CVVH or diffusive clearance using CVVHD for the first 24 hrs, followed by the other modality for 24 hrs. All treatments utilized AN 69 <b>hemofilters.</b> CVVH was performed with an ultrafiltration rate of 2 L/hr and CVVHD with a dialysis outflow rate of 2 L/hr. Measurements and Main Results: Plasma and ultrafiltrate concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 10, and sL-selectin were measured at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hrs by radioimmunoassay. Plasma endotoxin concentrations were also measured at 0, 12, and 24 hrs by chromogenic assay. CVVH was associated with a 13 % decrease in plasma TNF-α concentrations compared with a 23 % increase while on CVVHD (p <. 05). Mean plasma concentrations of IL- 6, IL- 10, and sL-selectin were unchanged over time and between therapies. Only minimal amounts of mediators were recovered in the effluents with either therapy except for IL- 6. The clearances for IL- 6 were different between therapies, 1. 9 ± 0. 8 (SD) mL/min for CVVHD and 3. 3 ± 1. 5 mL/min for CVVH, (p <. 01). Plasma endotoxin concentrations were not different between therapies. Conclusion: CVVH resulted in a decrease in plasma TNF-α concentrations as compared with CVVHD, while the type of transport mechanism used did not influence plasma concentrations of IL- 6, IL- 10, soluble L- selectin, or endotoxin. Differences in clearance for IL- 6 between CVVH and CVVHD did not translate into significant changes in circulating IL- 6 concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Short <b>hemofilter</b> {{survival}} and anticoagulation-related life-threatening complications are major problems in systemic anticoagulation with heparin (SAH) for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The present study examined if regional anticoagulation with citrate (RAC) using commercially available solutions can overcome the associated problems of SAH to produce economical benefits. Methods: Forty-six patients {{were assigned to}} receive SAH or RAC. We assessed the coagulation state, clinical outcomes, and adverse events. A Kaplan-Meier {{analysis was used to}} estimate <b>hemofilter</b> life span. The economical benefit related to the prolonged <b>hemofilter</b> survival was examined {{on the basis of the}} average daily cost. Results: The mean age of patients was 66. 5 ± 13. 8 years and the majority were male (60. 9 %). While elective discontinuation was most common cause of early CRRT interruption in the RAC group (34. 3 %, p < 0. 01), <b>hemofilter</b> clotting was most prevalent in the SAH group (82. 2 %, p < 0. 01). The patient metabolic and electrolyte control and survival rate were not different between the two groups. When compared with the RAC group, the anticoagulation-associated bleeding was a major complication in the SAH group (15. 0 % vs. 61. 5 %, p < 0. 01). Regional anticoagulated hemofilters displayed a significantly longer survival time than systemic anticoagulated hemofilters (59. 5 ± 3. 8 hr vs. 15. 6 ± 1. 3 hr, p < 0. 01). Accordingly, the mean daily continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration costs in the RAC and SAH groups were $ 575 ± 268 and $ 1, 209 ± 517, respectively (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: RAC prolonged <b>hemofilter</b> survival, displaying an economical benefit without severe adverse effects. The present study therefore demonstrates that RAC, using commercially available solutions, may be advantageous over SAH as a cost-effective treatment in CRRT.

40|$|Influence of {{hematocrit}} on hemostasis {{in continuous}} venovenous hemofiltration during acute renal failure. BackgroundHematocrit {{plays a major}} role in primary hemostasis by influencing blood viscosity and platelet adhesion. During continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), it is suspected that an increased hematocrit is accompanied by an activation of hemostasis and frequently leads to thromboses in the extracorporeal system. In order to examine this hypothesis, we studied the influence of hematocrit on hemostasis during CVVH. MethodsFourteen patients (8 men and 6 women, mean age 65 ± 10 years) with acute renal failure undergoing CVVH were prospectively enrolled. Polysulfone <b>hemofilters</b> (AV 600 ®; Fresenius, Oberursel, Germany) were used in all of the patients; blood flow rates were adjusted to 120 ml/min. No blood products and coagulation-related medication, except unfractionated heparin, were applied. Study exclusion criteria included a history of thromboembolism and artificial heart valves. Hemostasis activation markers (fibrinopeptide A, thrombin-antithrombin III complex, β-thromboglobulin, platelet retention) and hematocrit values were determined before and at three-day intervals during the course of CVVH treatment. ResultsThe mean hematocrit value (± sem) was 29 ± 1 % (range, 22 to 35 %). Patients with hematocrit values of less than 30 % (N = 7) were compared with patients with higher hematocrit values (> 30 %, N = 7). The patients with a lower hematocrit (30 %), as indicated by a tendency toward higher values for fibrinopeptide A (25 ± 8 vs. 14 ± 5 ng/ml, P = 0. 35), thrombin-antithrombin III complex (15 ± 4 vs. 10 ± 2 ng/ml, P = 0. 66), and a higher β-thromboglobulin/creatinine ratio (0. 62 ± 0. 17 vs. 0. 48 ± 0. 12, P = 0. 8). ConclusionContrary to our hypothesis, hematocrit values of more than 30 % are not accompanied by an increased hemostasis activation during CVVH. Concerning hemostasis activation, hematocrit values between 30 and 35 % may be suitable for patients on CVVH...|$|R
40|$|Impact of {{different}} modalities of continuous venovenous hemofiltration on sepsis-induced alterations in experimental pancreatitis. BackgroundContinuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) {{is assumed to}} attenuate systemic complications in septic diseases. The impact {{of different}} treatment intensities of CVVH on immunologic and systemic alterations in experimental pancreatitis was evaluated. MethodsEighty-four minipigs were allocated either to an untreated control group (group 1) or to one of six treatment groups (groups 2 to 7) that underwent CVVH in different modalities: (1) : “late” CVVH, started after a decline of total peripheral resistance of 30 % versus “prophylactic” CVVH started immediately after the induction of pancreatitis; (2) no change of <b>hemofilters</b> versus a periodic change of filters every 12 hours; (3) low-volume CVVH with a filtrate turnover of 20 mL/kg body weight (BW) /h versus high-volume CVVH (100 mL/kg/h). Pancreatitis was induced by intraductal injection of sodium-taurocholate (3 %, 1 mL/kg BW) and enterokinase (2 U/kg BW). We focused on the occurrence of sepsis, serum cytokines, down-regulation of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) and the endotoxin receptor CD 14 expression, bacterial translocation/endotoxemia, and pulmonary and renal histologic alterations. ResultsCVVH delayed or definitively prevented the occurrence of sepsis. Pancreatitis {{was associated with a}} tremendous initial tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) response prior to a return to near baseline levels in the late course of sepsis. Endotoxin hyporesponsiveness, suggested by the dissociation of decreasing TNF-α levels and increasing endotoxemia in end-stage sepsis, was favorably influenced by CVVH. Down-regulation of MHC II and CD 14 expression was prevented in non-septic animals. CVVH-related sepsis-protection led to a significant attenuation of histological injury in lungs and kidneys. “Prophylactic” CVVH prevented histological changes more effectively than “late” CVVH. ConclusionsCVVH offers a therapeutic option for supportive treatment in severe pancreatitis. The efficiency of CVVH is associated with the duration of filter use and cumulative plasma turnover. Since CVVH may lead to sepsis-protection and long-term survival, further evaluation in controlled, clinical trials is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor-α during continuous high-flux hemodialysis in sepsis {{with acute}} renal failure. Suppressed ex vivo endotoxin (ET) -induced {{production of the}} proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), in isolated mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is associated with fatal outcome in severe sepsis. PBMCs from surviving patients, but not those from nonsurviving patients, recover their capacity to produce normal amounts of TNF-α. We tested the influence of two modalities of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on ex vivo-induced whole-blood production of TNF-α and inhibitory TNF-soluble receptor type I (TNFsRI) in 12 patients with acute renal failure and sepsis (APACHE II score 22 to 30). MethodsStandard continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH; 36 liters of bicarbonate substitution fluid per day) was performed in 7 patients using polyamid <b>hemofilters</b> (FH 66; Gambro). In an additional five patients, we performed daily 18 hours of high-flux hemodialysis (CHFD) using polysulfon F 60 S dialyzers (Fresenius) and 75 liters of bicarbonate dialysate using the GENIUS® single-pass batch dialysis system. Samples were separated from the blood circuit {{as well as from}} the ultrafiltrate/spent dialysate lines at the start, during, and end of treatment. Whole-blood samples were incubated with 1 ng/ml of ET for three hours at 37 °C. Ultrafiltrate or dialysate samples were incubated with donor whole blood in the presence of ET to measure suppressing activity in ultrafiltrate and spent dialysate. ResultsAt the start of CRRT, ET-induced whole-blood TNF-α production was suppressed to approximately 10 % of that in normal controls. During CVVH, median ET-induced TNF-α production increased from 0. 35 ng/ml at the start to 1. 2 ng/ml at three hours, but decreased to pre-CVVH levels at the end of a 24 -hour period. In contrast, in patients on CHFD, the median ET-induced TNF-α production was 0. 5 ng/ml at the start, 1. 1 ng/ml at 3 hours, 1. 6 ng/ml at six hours, and 1. 5 ng/ml at the end of 18 hours of treatment. The ultrafiltrate obtained after three hours of CVVH did not contain suppressing activity. In CHFD, the spent dialysate as compared with fresh dialysate suppressed ET-induced TNF-α production in donor blood by 33 % throughout the 18 hours of treatment. Whole-blood production of TNFsRI did not change significantly at any time point during CVVH or CHFD. ConclusionThese data suggest that high-volume CHFD is superior to standard CVVH in removing a suppressing factor of proinflammatory cytokine production. As CVVH only transiently improves TNF-α production, it is most likely that the putative suppressing factor is removed because of saturable membrane adsorption in CVVH. In CHFD, there is a combination of adsorption and detectable diffusion into the dialysate. It remains to be shown whether a further increase in the volume of dialysate per day is able to not only improve but normalize the cytokine response and improve outcome in septic patients with acute renal failure...|$|R
