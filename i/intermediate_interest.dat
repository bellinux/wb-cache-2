40|$|The {{expertise}} {{and knowledge of}} veterinary advisors on improving animal health management is key towards a better herd health status. However, veterinary advisors are not always aware of the goals and priorities of dairy farmers. To dairy farmers animal health is {{only one aspect of}} farm management and resources may be allocated to other more preferred areas. Veterinary advisors may experience this as non-compliant with their advice. To explore the preferences of European Union (EU) organic dairy farmers for improved animal health management relative to other farm management areas an adaptive conjoint analysis (ACA) was performed. A total of 215 farmers participated originating from organic dairy farms in France (n= 70), Germany (n= 60), Spain (n= 28) and Sweden (n= 57). The management areas udder health and claw health represented animal health management whereas barn, calf and pasture management represented potential conflicting management areas. Results indicate that EU organic dairy farmers differ in their preferences for improved animal health management within the farming system. In general, improved calf management was the most preferred area and improved claw health management was found to be least preferred, the remaining areas were of <b>intermediate</b> <b>interest.</b> Cluster analyses on claw health measures and udder health measures resulted in respectively seven and nine distinct preference profiles. The results indicate a high degree of variation in farmers’ preference, which cannot be explained by the typical herd characteristics. With the individual preferences revealed by ACA, a veterinary advisor can now find out whether his intended advice is directed at a favourable or unfavourable management area of the farmer. If the latter is the case the veterinarian should first create awareness of the problem to the farmer. Insights in individual farmers preferences will allow veterinary advisors to better understand why farmers were incompliant with their advice and improve their advice by showing, for example, the potential benefits of their advice...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the complex and delicate issue of allocation {{of the burden of}} proof of causation in medical liability. The research has followed two lines of investigation, functional between them. First of all, it shows the different jurisprudential approaches to this topic, paying particular attention to the orientation that has prevailed (and summarized in the Corte di Cassazione’s judgement n. 577 / 2008), whilst trying to highlight the conflicts with the general principles of contractual liability. Secondly, a reconstructive proposal has been presented to shoulder a uniform solution in terms of allocating the burden of proof, suitable on one side to overcome the prevailing jurisprudence’s criticality and on the other to recover consistency with the law, and furthermore, with the general principles of allocation of the burden of proof. This study is divided in three parts. The first one, an introduction, offers a survey {{of the state of the}} art of medical liability, with particular consideration to the nature of this liability, in order to identify the relevant legal category (art. 1218 Civil Code) and the reasons that make it systematically consistent on the one hand, and appropriate on the other. In this context, an account of the recent legislative amendment introduced by Decreto Balduzzi has been given. Its reference in the article 2043 of the Civil Code has been interpreted by the prevailing jurisprudence as irrelevant to the nature of medical liability, which therefore, continues to be related to the contractual paradigm. The second part {{deals with the}} analysis of the responses offered by doctrine and jurisprudence to the specific problem of allocating the burden of proof of a causal link between the damage alleged by the patient and doctor’s non-fulfilment. In particular the traditional approach and the one anointed by Cass., sez. un., n. 577 / 2008 («it is sufficient that the patient adduces a qualified non-fulfilment, or theoretically apt to produce the damage») were compared. The orientation introduced by this judgment has been analysed in detail: in particular, the impact of this new case-law with the current law. Assumed the principle of proof’s proximity, the question asked was how this principle can be placed in our system and what are its relations with law. The third part of the research wants to be a reconstructive hypothesis. First of all, the reasons that justify the existence of a crossroads of applied solutions as numerous as different from each other has been researched. The cause was identified in the peculiar features that characterize the health-care obligation. These characters were found: in the object, consisting in the activity adequate not in meeting the ultimate interest of the patient (healing), but the <b>intermediate</b> <b>interest</b> (performance’s accuracy) only teleologically directed to that aim (the reference is to the traditional distinction between means and result obligations); in the peculiar structure of the damage, which due to its similarity, in some ways, to the damage in tort law, has led the jurisprudence, and the doctrine, to borrow the distinction between natural and legal causation, creating many problems of coordination; and last in the hybrid nature of the required behaviour of the debtor, consisting of a "performance" and/or "protection" duty. It is through the analysis of these unique profiles, their "variables", and the relationship between them and the current law, that it seemed possible to reach the formulation of a clear answer, suitable as a general solution to the problem relating to the allocation of the burden of proof: the restoration of the rule which places the burden of proof on causation to the patient. The role of «loss of chance» damage and hypothesis of a liability’s apportionment have also been taken into consideration with the caveat, however, these are institutions capable of influencing not the an of causation’s proof but only the quantum, which remains therefore set on the patient. Finally, act of plausible need for adjustments or corrections to the current law has been acknowledged. Such are likely to meet the perceived needs of social nature related to the particular quality of the interest, which embodies the doctor-patient relationship, as well as the natural asymmetry between the positions of the parties. However, on the assumption of no possibility for a path-oriented jurisprudence in this direction, forcing the inevitable penalty of the law, a prospect legislative guide (de iure condendo) has opened, taking the health care liability reform recently implemented in Germany as exampl...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} the spreading effect of industrial sectors with complex network model under perspective of econophysics.

Thus, industrial complex network based on input-output tables from WIOD is proposed to be a bridge connecting accurate static quantitative analysis and comparable dynamic one. With application of revised structural holes theory, flow betweenness and random walk centrality were respectively chosen to evaluate industrial sectors' long-term and short-term spreading effect process in this paper. It shows that industries with higher flow betweenness or random walk centrality would bring about more intensive industrial spreading effect to the industrial chains they stands in, because value stream transmission of industrial sectors depends on how many products or services it can get from the other ones, and they are regarded as brokers with bigger information superiority and more <b>intermediate</b> <b>interests...</b>|$|R

The law courts were giving conflicting judgements as regards the rights and liabilities of the intermediate classes and also of the peasants. The government tried to accommodate this class by enacting the Rent Act in 1859. To improve relations between landlord and tenant, a Rent Commission was set up in 1880. By the recommendations and observations of the Rent Commission, the Bengal Legislative Council enacted Act III of 1885 which defined rights and obligations of intermediate tenancies and raiyati tenancies. In 1905, Bengal was partitioned and then the Government of India Act of 1919 and 1935 were enacted. Finally in 1947, Bengal was further partitioned once again before the Indian Independence Act 1947 was enacted that separated the old Indian Empire into the Dominion of Pakistan and the Dominion of India in the month of August of the same year.|$|R

40|$|The {{multistage}} {{process of}} borohydride oxidation in an 8 e- reaction to borate at a Au electrode {{has been studied}} by means of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (CV) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The total irreversibility of this process observed previously is {{shown to be a}} result of the presence of very unstable intermediates. CV measurements showed that at least two stages of the process are quasi-reversible, and the presence of a coupled homogeneous chemical reaction was proved by SECM. The rate constant for this reaction as well as the electrochemical kinetic parameters for the first stage of oxidation are evaluated using digital simulation. The adsorption of the electroactive species associated with the first two-electron stage of the oxidation becomes apparent at scan rates higher than 200 V/s. A very small fractional surface coverage (estimated to be less than 0. 001) is shown to produce CV waves characteristic of adsorption- rather than diffusion-controlled processes. The second chemical stage of this process is much faster than the first. The oxidation of borohydride at a gold anode is shown to have a different mechanism than that proposed earlier for a platinum electrode. We describe here a study of the electrochemical oxida-tion of borohydride (or tetrahydroborate), BH;, at a gold electrode and the use of ultramicroelectrodes and fast techniques to study this complex process. Electrochemi-cal oxidation of sodium borohydride and its derivatives in aqueous olutions was a subject of several detailed studies as described in a previous review 1.

In order to obtain further intermediate-band material proposals, this work focuses on studing other compounds constituted mainly by tetravalent elements. The first proposal is vanadium substituting Sn atoms in SnS 2, the second one is composed by type II silicon clathrate with two possibilities: vanadium substituting Si and Ag occluded in the intra-crystalline cavities. UV-Vis-NIR spectra {{of some of these}} systems experimentally synthesized show an agreement with previous theoretical prediction...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we used a}} data set {{constructed}} for a companion paper (Fritsche/Stephan, 2000) where we explored the leading indicator properties of different time series for the German business cycle. Now we test for the ability of different indicator series to forecast recessions by using a probit approach as proposed by Estrella/Mishkin (1997). The dating procedure refers to the study by Artis et. al. (1997). We took into consideration the criticism made by Dueker (1997) who stated that in the probit model {{the fact that the}} economy is already in a state of recession must be controlled for. The results of our estimate are unsatisfactory on the whole. Only the ifo institute's business expectation of producers of <b>intermediate</b> inputs, the <b>interest</b> rate spread, the long-term interest rate, and money supply M 2 show satisfactory leading properties. business cycle, probit model, modified McFadden's R 2, recession, Germany...|$|R
40|$|The weak kaon {{production}} off the nucleon {{induced by}} neutrinos is {{studied at the}} low and <b>intermediate</b> energies of <b>interest</b> for some ongoing and future neutrino oscillation experiments. This process is also potentially important {{for the analysis of}} proton decay experiments. We develop a microscopical model based on the SU(3) chiral Lagrangians. The basic parameters of the model are f pi, the pion decay constant, Cabibbo's angle, the proton and neutron magnetic moments, and the axial vector coupling constants for the baryons octet, D and F, that are obtained from the analysis of the semileptonic decays of neutron and hyperons. The studied mechanisms are the main source of kaon production for neutrino energies up to 1. 2 to 1. 5 GeV for the various channels and the cross sections are large enough to be amenable to be measured by experiments such as Minerva and T 2 K...|$|R
40|$|The quasielastic (QE) {{contribution}} of the nuclear inclusive electron scattering model developed by Gil, Nieves, and Oset [Nucl. Phys. A 627, 543 (1997); A 627, 599 (1997) ] is extended {{to the study of}} electroweak charged current (CC) induced nuclear reactions, at <b>intermediate</b> energies of <b>interest</b> for future neutrino oscillation experiments. The model accounts for, among other nuclear effects, long range nuclear [random phase approximation (RPA) ] correlations, final state interaction (FSI), and Coulomb corrections. Predictions for the inclusive muon capture in C- 12 and the reaction C- 12 (V-mu, mu(-)) X near threshold are also given. RPA correlations are shown to play a crucial role and their inclusion leads to one of the best existing simultaneous description of both processes, with accuracies of the order of 10 - 15 % for the muon capture rate and even better for the Liquid Scintillating Neutrino Detector (LSND) measurement...|$|R

Three features distinguish CCN transport from the TCP/IP model: unique endpoint at the receiver, pull-based data retrieval in {{a point to}} multi-point fashion and in-path caching. The definition of transport control mechanisms is of fun-damental importance within the CCN architectural design and beyond, in the broader scope of information-centric net-works. In this work, we propose a joint Hop-by-hop and Receiver-driven Interest Control Protocol (HR-ICP) to reg-ulate user requests (Interests) either at the receiver and at <b>intermediate</b> nodes via <b>Interest</b> shaping. We prove that HR-ICP is stable and converges to an efficient and max-min fair equilibrium. Compared to controlling traffic only at the re-ceiver, HR-ICP accelerates congestion reaction and reduces the loss rate, as we show by means of CCN packet-level sim-ulations. In different network scenarios, we highlight the advantages of our solution in terms of faster convergence to the optimal throughput, robustness against misbehaving re-ceivers and flow protection of delay-sensitive applications...|$|R
