25|$|The {{attempt to}} render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to find them {{in the sphere of}} {{spontaneous}} apperception, and above reflective necessity, is unsuccessful. Cause, substance, time, space, are given us as realized in a particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance, much less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality of their application. There may be particular instances or cases of these laws, but we could never get the laws themselves in their universality, far less absolute impersonality. No amount of individual instances of the application of any of them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure test we have of their universality <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> is the test of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality. How far and in what sense this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved.|$|E
25|$|McLuhan {{writes about}} robotism {{in the context}} of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new ways of {{thinking}} about technology. The Western way of thinking about technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of our brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of Blade Runner and the novels of Philip K. Dick. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: “Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience.</b> Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours.” The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.|$|E

[...] Following this, Walter Jackson Bate, in 1963, claimed that [...] " [...] each generation {{has found it}} one of the most nearly perfect poems in English."

It is a poem that, without ever stating it, inevitably suggests the truth of 'ripeness is all' by developing, with a richness of profundity of implication, the simple perception that ripeness is fall." [...] In 1981, William Walsh argued that [...] "Among the major Odes [...] no one has questioned the place and supremacy of 'To Autumn', in which we see wholly realized, powerfully embodied in art, the complete maturity so earnestly laboured at in Keats's life, so persuasively argued about in his letters." [...] Literary critic and academic Helen Vendler, in 1988, declared that [...] "in the ode 'To Autumn,' Keats finds his most comprehensive and adequate symbol for the social value of art." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAims: we aim from {{a review}} of our early and late {{experience}} of secondary intervention for technical failures, to examine and describe the impact of endovascular and open interventions. Methods: 108 Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAAs) repaired endoluminally between 1995 - 2001 were analysed. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> early <b>experience,</b> during 1995 / 96 home made pre-expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts fixed with Palmaz stents were used (n = 26). <b>In</b> <b>our</b> later <b>experience,</b> 1997 / 2001 Talent (n = 70) or Zenith endografts (n = 12) were used. All cases underwent spiral CT at 5 days and 6 monthly intervals post-op. Angiography was performed when further intervention was intended. All technical failures requiring intervention or not were studied. Results: there were 28 (26 %) technical failures identified of which 14 of 26 (54 %) occurred <b>in</b> <b>our</b> early <b>experience,</b> and 14 of 86 (16 %) occurred <b>in</b> <b>our</b> later <b>experience</b> (p < 0. 05). Eleven in all required open conversion {{at the time of}} endovascular repair. Our study cohort were the remaining 17 cases requiring secondary intervention, seven were from <b>our</b> early <b>experience</b> and 10 from <b>our</b> later <b>experience.</b> There were 12 endoleaks, including two as a result of graft migration, two graft occlusions, two graft distortions and one graft infection. Overall 10 (66 %) technical failures were treated by endoluminal repair and seven (34 %) by open methods. However, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> later <b>experience</b> significantly more endoluminal techniques (80 %) were used (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: technical failure rates were significanlty higher <b>in</b> <b>our</b> earlier <b>experience.</b> Open repair, which was a feature of <b>our</b> early <b>experience,</b> has been avoided over the final 3 years.

But whether voices were heard in the sky, or not; whether his mother or his father dreamed that the infant man-child was the son of Apollo; whether a swarm of bees settled on his lips, or not; a man who could see two sides of a thing was born. The wonderful synthesis so familiar in nature; the upper and the under side of the medal of Jove; the union of impossibilities, which reappears in every object; its real and its ideal power,--was now, also, transferred entire to the consciousness of a man.|$|E
60|$|Sitting in {{the cool}} evenings {{on one of these}} great blocks, and {{watching}} the Himalayan glaciers glowing with the rays of sunset, appearing to change in form and dimensions with the falling shadows, it was impossible to refrain from speculating on the possibility of these great boulders heaped on the Himalayan-ward face of the Khasia range, having been transported hither by ice at some former period; especially as the Mont Blanc granite, in crossing the lake of Geneva to the Jura, must have performed a hardly less wonderful ice journey: but this hypothesis is clearly untenable; and unparalleled <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> as the results appear, if attributed to denudation and weathering alone, we are yet compelled to refer them to these causes.

60|$|I {{have dealt}} with the issues between Houses, and I come to that between Parties. Great changes in a {{community}} are very often unperceived; the focus of reality moves from one institution in the State to another, and almost imperceptibly. Sometimes the forms of institutions remain almost the same in all ceremonial aspects, and yet there will be one institution which under pretentious forms is only the husk of reality, and another which under a humble name is in fact the operative pivot of the social system. Constitutional writers have much to say about the estates of the realm, and a great deal to say about their relation to each other, and to the Sovereign. All that is found to be treated upon at length. But they say very little about the Party system. And, after all, the Party system is the dominant fact <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience.</b> Nothing is more striking in the last twenty-five years than the growth and expansion of Party organisation, {{and the way in which}} millions of people and their votes have been woven into its scope.|$|E
60|$|I do not myself {{believe that}} {{anything}} approaching certainty {{is to be}} attained by either of these methods, and therefore whatever lies outside my personal biography must be regarded, theoretically, as hypothesis. The theoretical argument for adopting the hypothesis is that it simplifies the statement of the laws according to which events happen <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience.</b> But there is no very good ground for supposing that a simple law {{is more likely to}} be true than a complicated law, though there is good ground for assuming a simple law in scientific practice, as a working hypothesis, if it explains the facts as well as another which is less simple. Belief in the existence of things outside my own biography exists antecedently to evidence, and can only be destroyed, if at all, by a long course of philosophic doubt. For purposes of science, it is justified practically by the simplification which it introduces into the laws of physics. But from the standpoint of theoretical logic it must be regarded as a prejudice, not as a well-grounded theory. With this proviso, I propose to continue yielding to the prejudice.|$|E
60|$|The {{facts of}} the case, as nearly as our {{reporter}} could determine them from the conflicting statements of eye-witnesses, were about as follows:--The affair was an election row, of course.

Rome would be the gainer by it if her very constables were elected to serve a century; for <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> we have never even been able to choose a dog-pelter without celebrating the event with a dozen knockdowns and a general cramming of the station-house with drunken vagabonds overnight.

Our frailties are invincible, our virtues barren; the battle goes sore against us to the going down of the sun.

60|$|Savonarola's {{nature was}} one of those in which {{opposing}} tendencies co-exist in almost equal strength: the passionate sensibility which, impatient of definite thought, floods every idea with emotion and tends towards contemplative ecstasy, alternated in him with a keen perception of outward facts and a vigorous practical judgment of men and things. And in this case of the Trial by Fire, the latter characteristics were stimulated into unusual activity by an acute physical sensitiveness which gives overpowering force to the conception of pain and destruction as a necessary sequence of facts which have already been causes of pain <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience.</b> The promptitude with which men will consent to touch red-hot iron with a wet finger is not to be measured by their theoretic acceptance of the impossibility that the iron will burn them: practical belief depends on what is most strongly represented in the mind at a given moment. And with the Frate's constitution, when the Trial by Fire was urged on his imagination as an immediate demand, it was impossible for him to believe that he or any other man could walk through the flames unhurt--impossible for him to believe that even if he resolved to offer himself, he would not shrink at the last moment.|$|E
60|$|Even {{where the}} {{derivative}} uniformity is between different {{effects of the}} same cause, it will by no means obtain as universally as {{the law of the}} cause itself. If a and b accompany or succeed one another as effects of the cause A, it by no means follows that A is the only cause which can produce them, or that if there be another cause, as B, capable of producing a, it must produce b likewise. The conjunction, therefore, of a and b perhaps does not hold universally, but only in the instances in which a arises from A. When it is produced by a cause other than A, a and b may be dissevered. Day (for example) is always <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> followed by night; but day is not the cause of night; both are successive effects of a common cause, the periodical passage of the spectator {{into and out of the}} earth’s shadow, consequent on the earth’s rotation, and on the illuminating property of the sun. If, therefore, day is ever produced by a different cause or set of causes from this, day will not, or at least may not, be followed by night. On the sun’s own surface, for instance, this may be the case.|$|E
