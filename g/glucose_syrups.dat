The research was started with converting the tapioca enzimatically through liquficaitionn and saccharification processes. The resulted <b>glucose</b> <b>syrup</b> was the purified by using activated charcoal in different concentrations, i. e. 1, 2, 3, and 4 % (w/v). The mixture of glucose and activated charcoal is then flowed through a column which was filled by zeolit before. The observed parameters were purification level by spectrofotometre, reducing sugar by DNS method, and ash content. After that, the purified <b>glucose</b> <b>syrup</b> was concentrated by using vacuum evaporator. The evaporation time was varied, i. e. 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 minutes.

The results showed that by using activated charcoal of 1 % and then was purified by using zeolit produced the best result of purification level, which was 93. 66 % T. The concentration process of the <b>glucose</b> <b>syrup</b> needed three hours to obtain the best result of high <b>glucose</b> <b>syrup</b> (HGS). The resulted HGS had a water content of 54 % with the sweetness level of 51 oBrix.

50|$|The DE is {{the measure}} of the amount of {{reducing}} sugars present in a sugar product in relation to glucose.

50|$|Depending on {{the method}} used to {{hydrolyse}} the starch and {{on the extent to}} which the hydrolysis reaction has been allowed to proceed, different grades of glucose syrup are produced, which have different characteristics and uses.

Enzyme conditions for starch hydrolysis were optimized by a factorial experimental design (3 ³× 2) using as variables substrate concentration, enzyme/substrate ratio and time reaction. Optimal enzyme reactions with 100 g of starch per L were: &# 945;-amylase at pH 5. 0, 80 °C and enzyme dosage of 130. 5 U g- 1 of starch; and glucoamylase, pH 4. 5, 70 °C and enzyme dosage of 81. 5 U g- 1 of starch.

40|$|Analogue {{models of}} lithospheric {{deformation}} and fluid dynamic models of mantle flow mostly use {{some kind of}} syrup such as honey or glucose syrup to simulate the low-viscosity sub-lithospheric mantle. This paper describes detailed rheological tests and density measurements of three brands of glucose syrup and three brands of honey. Additional tests have been done for one brand of glucose syrup that was diluted with water to various degrees (2 %, 5 % and 10 % by weight). The rheological tests have been done to test the effect of shear strain, shear rate and temperature on the dynamic viscosity of the syrup. The {{results show that the}} viscosity of all <b>glucose</b> <b>syrups</b> and honeys is independent of shear strain (i. e. no strain hardening or softening). The viscosity of the <b>glucose</b> <b>syrups</b> is independent of shear rate (γ̇), i. e. linear-viscous or Newtonian, in the range γ̇= 10 - 4 - 100 s- 1 with stress exponents that are almost identical to one (n= 0. 995 - 1. 004). All the honeys show a very weak, but consistent, decrease in viscosity with increasing shear rate of 7 - 14 % from 10 - 3 to 100 s- 1 and have stress exponents more distinct from one (n= 1. 007 - 1. 026). All syrups have a viscosity that is strongly dependent on temperature in the range 0 - 50 °C, where viscosity decreases with increasing temperature. Such decrease can be fitted with exponential and Arrhenius functions, with the latter giving the best results. Furthermore, the viscosity of glucose syrup decreases approximately exponentially with increasing water content. Oscillation tests indicate that the rheology of all the syrups is entirely dominated by viscous behaviour and not by elastic behaviour at frequencies of 10 - 3 - 102 Hz. Finally, the density investigations show that the density of glucose syrup and honey decreases approximately linearly with increasing temperature in the range 10 - 70 °C, with coefficients of thermal volumetric expansion at 20 °C of 3. 89 - 3. 95 × 10 - 4 °C- 1 and 4. 57 - 4. 81 × 10 - 4 °C- 1 for glucose syrup and honey, respectively. The new results demonstrate that <b>glucose</b> <b>syrups</b> and (to a lesser degree) honeys are well suited for usage in analogue and fluid dynamic experiments to represent linear-viscous strain independent and shear rate independent rheologies to model geological processes. <b>Glucose</b> <b>syrups</b> have the added advantage of being more transparent than honeys, allowing for accurately resolving and quantifying flow patterns in the fluid during a model run...|$|E
