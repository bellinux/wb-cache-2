5|$|Meteor {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Germaniawerft {{shipyard}} in Kiel in 1888, and launched on 20 January 1890. Fitting-out work then commenced, and was completed by 19 May 1891, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Meteor served with the fleet only briefly; {{this was due to}} her poor handling and <b>excessive</b> <b>vibration</b> at high speed. In 1893, she was assigned as the dispatch vessel for the I Division of the Maneuver Squadron, which was composed of the four s.|$|E
5|$|Neither ship {{remained}} on active service long, {{primarily due to}} their <b>excessive</b> <b>vibration.</b> Meteor was assigned as the dispatch vessel for the I Division of the Maneuver Squadron in 1893, but was reduced to reserve status by 1895. Comet served in the III Division for the annual maneuvers in August and September 1893 but she too was quickly placed in reserve. In 1904, both ships were reactivated as guard ships, but this service {{did not last long}} either. By 1911, both ships had again been withdrawn and stricken from the naval register; Meteor became a barracks ship in Kiel while Comet was used as a mine hulk in Danzig. Meteor and Comet were sold for scrapping in 1919 and 1921, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft's number 2 port engine No.5097, {{constructed}} in 1961, had run for 14,917 hours from new, {{and had been}} overhauled in spring 1965 because of vibration caused by metal fatigue that had led {{to the failure of}} a stage 8 high-pressure compressor blade. In 1967 the engine had been removed from service because of flame tube deterioration, and as part of the repairs, the low-pressure compressor, of which the number 5 wheel was an original component, was overhauled, but the wheel itself was not tested for fatigue. On 22 November 1967 the engine was bench tested and rejected because of <b>excessive</b> <b>vibration</b> of the high-pressure compressor, but was later released as serviceable following further analysis. After 1,415 hours service on another 707 and modification to the turbine seals, on 5 April 1968 No.5097 became number 2 engine of the port wing of the aircraft, scheduled to fly long-haul to Sydney, Australia, three days later.|$|E
50|$|Some nearby {{residents}} experienced <b>excessive</b> <b>vibrations</b> when trains passed {{their homes}} {{for the first year}} after trains started running. Subsequent rail grinding in the years following construction has relieved almost all vibration issues.|$|R
50|$|The {{cable-stayed}} {{design was}} chosen because it was both cheaper and more resistant to high winds than a suspension bridge. Shortly after opening, the longest cables exhibited <b>excessive</b> <b>vibrations,</b> so several damping systems were quickly retrofitted.|$|R
50|$|Salicylic acid {{competitively}} {{interferes with}} anion binding to OHC prestin which thereby reduces motility. This reduction in active displacement is again associated with {{depression of the}} cochlear amplifier which decreases the <b>excessive</b> <b>vibrations</b> experienced during noise-exposure.|$|R
25|$|CCTV {{footage from}} the #2 bus Menezes caught {{to the station}} was also shown during the inquest; it too, was incomplete. The IPCC claimed {{this was due to}} <b>excessive</b> <b>vibration</b> which {{prevented}} several cameras on the bus from working.|$|E
25|$|The first {{prototype}} flew in January 1919, {{powered by}} two 320hp Dragonfly engines. The prototype encountered handling problems, and was handicapped by the Dragonfly engines, which were extremely unreliable, being prone to overheating and <b>excessive</b> <b>vibration,</b> while not delivering the expected power. Two further prototypes were cancelled in 1919, with no {{aircraft in the}} end being purchased to replace the DH.10.|$|E
25|$|Designers Bruno and Franz Steffen piloted the {{aircraft}} themselves {{on its first}} test flight on 24 May 1915. They ended this flight prematurely because of overheating in the gearboxes, and subsequent tests revealed other defects such as <b>excessive</b> <b>vibration</b> in the drive system. With these problems addressed, the R.I was ready for its Idflieg acceptance flights in June 1915. Bruno Steffen ferried the three-person inspection team, plus a number of passengers, from Neumünster to Döberitz. He had even placed two armchairs {{and a bottle of}} champagne in the cabin for the occasion. The R.I reached Döberitz safely and made around twenty-four test flights before it was accepted by the military on 26 July 1915.|$|E
50|$|Vitamins A, C and E {{have been}} shown to be 'free radical scavengers' by studies looking for {{protective}} tendencies of antioxidants. In addition, NAC, or N-acetyl-L-cysteine (acetylcysteine), has been shown to reduce ROS formation associated with the <b>excessive</b> <b>vibrations</b> induced by the noise exposure.|$|R
50|$|Furosemide {{injections}} {{prior to}} noise exposure {{have been shown}} to decrease the endocochlear potential. This decrease results in a reduction of active cochlear displacements and it is believed that the protection by furosemide stems from the limitation of <b>excessive</b> <b>vibrations</b> while the cochlear amplifier is depressed.|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{solution}} of an optimal control problem for two coupled linear membranes subjected to pointwise actuators {{together with a}} quadratic cost functional is given. The membranes are simply supported along the boundaries. The basic control problem is to control <b>excessive</b> <b>vibrations</b> in the system. Necessary conditions of optimality are investigated.

25|$|After Operation Morris Dance, Tobruk {{returned}} to mainly routine duties. She travelled to New Zealand on a training cruise in early 1988 and {{was placed on}} alert to carry an Army force to evacuate Australian civilians from Vanuatu in April 1988 following a political crisis there. While Tobruk was loaded with stores and three Sea King helicopters, this deployment did not eventuate and the ship was unloaded on 24 May. The ship transported the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment's vehicles and supplies {{to the west coast}} of the United States in early 1989 and participated in a joint Australian, British, Canadian and United States amphibious warfare exercise at Monterey Bay. The ship then visited Canada before returning to Australia. In December 1989, Tobruk was forced to undergo unscheduled repairs at Newcastle to repair damage caused by <b>excessive</b> <b>vibration,</b> which had possibly been caused by her engines revving at a higher rate than the ship had been designed for.|$|E
25|$|Unexpected {{problems}} and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced {{abandonment of the}} station for safety reasons, had these problems not been resolved. During STS-120 in 2007, following the relocation of the P6 truss and solar arrays, it was noted during the redeployment of the array that it had become torn and was not deploying properly. An EVA {{was carried out by}} Scott Parazynski, assisted by Douglas Wheelock. The men took extra precautions {{to reduce the risk of}} electric shock, as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight. The issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ), which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station. <b>Excessive</b> <b>vibration</b> and high-current spikes in the array drive motor were noted, resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard SARJ until the cause was understood. Inspections during EVAs on STS-120 and STS-123 showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic race ring at the heart of the joint, and so the joint was locked to prevent further damage. Repairs to the joint were carried out during STS-126 with lubrication of both joints and the replacement of 11 out of 12 trundle bearings on the joint.|$|E

50|$|MV Chetzemoka ("The Chetzy") is a Kwa-di Tabil-class ferry {{built at}} Todd Pacific Shipyards in Seattle, Washington for the Washington State Ferries. It was {{scheduled}} to start on the Port Townsend-Coupeville (Keystone)route in September 2010, but sea trials revealed <b>excessive</b> <b>vibrations</b> in the vessels propulsion system. The ferry was christened by Governor Christine Gregoire and began service November 14, 2010.|$|R
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen <b>excessive</b> <b>vibrations.</b> Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|R
500|$|Comet {{served only}} briefly with the fleet, owing {{in large part}} to her poor {{handling}} and <b>excessive</b> <b>vibration</b> at high speed. She and her sister ship [...] were quickly placed in reserve, though in 1899 they were reclassified as light cruisers. Starting on 3 May 1904, Comet was employed as a harbor defense ship in Danzig. She was stricken from the naval register on 24 June 1911 and starting in 1913 was used as a mine hulk in Emden. She served in this capacity through World War I and was broken up in 1921 in Hamburg.|$|E
500|$|On the Southern Railway's Central and Eastern sections, crews {{complained that}} the {{locomotives}} rolled heavily and unpredictably on the cheaply laid track of the former SECR and LBSCR networks, leading to their nickname, [...] "Rolling Rivers". The rolling was in part caused {{by the type of}} coil suspension and steadying springs used on the Bissel truck and bogie axles, which caused adverse springing on poor track. These were modified in later batches, with limited success. The rough-riding was also attributed to the frames, which were of insubstantial construction to save weight. The bracing proved incapable of counteracting the stresses applied to the frames when travelling at speed and caused <b>excessive</b> <b>vibration</b> on the footplate at higher outputs.|$|E
500|$|The ship {{also carried}} 105 Type 96 25mm light AA guns in 35 triple-gun mounts. These [...] guns had an {{effective}} range of , and an effective ceiling of [...] at {{an elevation of}} +85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent {{need to change the}} fifteen-round magazines. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it largely ineffective. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to [...] "handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, it possessed <b>excessive</b> <b>vibration</b> and muzzle blast"....

50|$|Currently it is {{believed}} that auditory fatigue and NIHL are related to <b>excessive</b> <b>vibrations</b> of the inner ear which may cause structural damages. Metabolic activity is required {{in order to maintain the}} electrochemical gradients used in mechano-electrical and electro-mechanical transduction during noise exposure and sound recognition. The metabolic activity is associated with active displacements which are components of the sound-induced vibration involving prestin, a motor protein that causes OHC motility. Excess vibrations require increased metabolic energy.|$|R
500|$|Their light AA {{armament}} {{consisted of}} a dozen triple-gun mounts for license-built Hotchkiss 25mm (1 in) Type 96 AA guns, six mounts {{on each side of}} the flight deck.

50|$|In engineering, a {{serviceability}} {{failure occurs}} when a structure does not collapse, but rather fails to meet the required specifications. For example, severe wind may cause an excess of vibration at a pedestrian bridge {{making it impossible to}} cross it safely or comfortably. Similar <b>excessive</b> <b>vibrations</b> can be caused by pedestrians due to their walking, running, or jumping. Similarly, storm conditions may cause water to spill over a coastal structure, so that boats are not safe behind the structure.|$|R
40|$|High {{levels of}} {{vibrations}} {{can occur in}} floor systems due to excitation from human activities such as walking and aerobics. In building floors, <b>excessive</b> <b>vibrations</b> are generally not a safety concern for building floor systems but a cause of annoyance and discomfort. <b>Excessive</b> <b>vibrations</b> typically occur in: (a) light weight floors; (b) floor systems with low stiffness where the floor dominant natural frequency {{is close to the}} excitation frequency; and (c) floors with low damping. While the floor mass and stiffness are normally constant during the life of the structure and can be estimated {{with a high degree of}} accuracy, damping is more difficult to predict because it is mostly associated with non-structural components such as partitions, false floors, suspended ceilings and ducts as well as furniture such as filing cabinets and bookshelfs. Current trends in the building industry associated with using lightweight materials, long-span open-plan floors and adoption of the electronic office, give rise to the importance of understanding floor vibrations and specifically damping. This paper provides a summary of factors affecting floor vibrations and discusses available damping systems which can be used to reduce vibration levels in floor systems...|$|R

500|$|When {{introduced}} in 1917, the Nclass proved adept at hauling both passenger and freight services on the SECR. They were well liked by crews who appreciated the general robustness of the design, although the lightly built frames caused <b>excessive</b> <b>vibration</b> and rough {{riding on the}} footplate when worked hard. Despite there being little wrong with the original design, the N class’ full steaming potential was not realised because of the failure to capitalise upon a larger boiler, which was {{a direct consequence of}} Maunsell’s standardisation policy. Instead, the SECR batch was trial-fitted with [...] "stovepipe" [...] chimneys in an attempt to improve draughting. This was initially applied to No.812 in 1921, although two more were fitted to Nos.817 and 819 during building because of a shortage of chimneys at Ashford Works. The chimney fitted to No.819 was transferred to No.818 sometime between 1921 and 1924, though all [...] "stovepipes" [...] had been replaced with the standard Nclass type by April 1927. Another trial saw the addition of a second slidebar to No.825, which gave better support to the valve gear and helped protect it from spillage from the driving wheel sander fillers.|$|E
500|$|The Australian Government ordered twelve C-130J Super Hercules in December 1995 and {{deliveries}} began during 1999.

At the time the order for the twelve C-130Js was placed, the Government also took out options for a further twenty-seven Super Hercules, but these were not taken up; the options included seven airborne early warning and control and eight aerial refuelling variants, as well as up to eight transports for the Royal New Zealand Air Force. The RAAF was the first operator of this C-130 variant, which was larger than earlier models and had a crew of only three (two pilots and a loadmaster) eliminating the navigator and flight engineer roles employed in earlier models. The aircraft initially suffered from serious mechanical and software problems as well as a shortage of spare parts, and were assessed as [...] "experiencing significant operational shortfalls" [...] in a 2002 Australian National Audit Office report. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation undertook considerable research into the C-130J design and developed improvements to the aircraft that addressed problems with <b>excessive</b> <b>vibration.</b> The 2009 Defence white paper [...] called for the acquisition of two more C-130Js to partially replace the H variants.
