25|$|Crevice {{corrosion}} is a localized form of corrosion {{occurring in}} confined spaces (crevices), {{to which the}} access of the working fluid from the environment is limited.

40|$|The {{formation}} of a localized <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> <b>cell</b> on metals, susceptible to both anodic and cathodic corrosion, is a serious threat because of multiple degradation processes commencing with the passivation layer destruction. By using local electrochemical and X-ray dispersive techniques, it has been demonstrated that the <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> <b>cell</b> formed on high brass (-brass, Cu 65 -Zn 35) {{in the presence of}} 1 H-benzotriazole or 5 -methyl- 1 H-benzotriazole plays both corrosion-inhibiting and accelerating roles, depending on the inhibitor exposure time. Alternating-current scanning electrochemical microscopy was used to image local electrochemical activity, whereas energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy provided evidence for the mechanism of the observed phenomena. Short-term exposure to the inhibitor (5 min) promotes the {{formation of}} a passivation layer in the waterline region. In contrast, after prolonged exposure (45 min), a deficient passivation layer develops for both inhibitors. An excess of zinc(II) -inhibitor complexes in the passivation layer is accountable for the corrosion resistance of the region with high differential aeration. Rapid dezincification and local alkalinization facilitate the initial rapid {{formation of a}} passivation layer in the area under differential aeration to preserve its composition upon further modification...|$|E

Corrosion of steel {{structures in the}} Duluth-Superior Harbor (DSH) is a severe economic problem. This corrosion is characterized by deep pits covered by crusty, orange, blister-like structures called tubercles. Prior research demonstrated these tubercles contain both iron-oxidizing (IOB) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) but fine scale changes of bacterial community structure within these tubercles remain unknown. Experimental steel coupons were placed at four sites in the DSH in 2006 and 2012 and recovered in 2013 to measure chemical gradients and identify bacteria associated with young and old corrosion tubercles. Oxygen concentrations measured with microelectrodes decreased from saturation in the overlying water to nearly anoxic conditions at the surface of tubercles while ferrous iron (Fe 2 +) concentration increased with depth inside the tubercles. Bacterial DNA from {{different regions of the}} tubercles was sequenced using a next-generation sequencing technique to characterize the bacterial communities. Bacterial community composition changed within the tubercles. Families containing bacteria that oxidize iron and sulfur were consistently found on the outsides of tubercles and on non-tubercle steel. Families with bacteria that reduce iron and sulfur were found on the undersides of tubercles and in corrosion pits on the steel surface. Iron-oxidizing bacteria were more abundant after 0. 8 years than 6. 6 years and were distributed throughout tubercles while sulfate-reducing bacteria were most abundant in corrosion pits. Combined, these data are consistent with the cathodic depolarization (<b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> <b>cell</b> model) and direct electron transfer theories of pitting corrosion, which provide explanations for the roles of bacteria in the accelerated corrosion of steel structures...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{complexities}} involved in both microbiologically influenced corrosion and deterioration of reinforced concrete structures by algae are explained. In this regards, the five possible corrosion/deterioration mechanisms {{that may be}} expected are addressed and described. These mechanisms are as follows: Absorption of some chemicals necessary for the algae from within the cement paste of the concrete: this mechanism can finally result in drying out the concrete and developing cracks {{as a result of}} formation of internal cavities and voids. Biofilm formation and increasing the likelihood of attracting more micro-/macroorganisms that can either deteriorate the concrete itself or the reinforcement steel inside, or both. An example as such can be development of an environment favorable for the acid-producing sulphur oxidizing bacteria that through generating very acidic conditions are capable of doing harm to both metallic and non-metallic phases of the reinforced concrete. Development of electrochemical <b>cells</b> such as <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> <b>cells</b> due to the photosynthetic driven oxygen production and consumption features of algae. In this way, it is likely that spots of varying oxygen partial pressures will be created, tus facilitating the corrosion of the steel inside.

Production of alkaline conditions that upon varying and fluctuating due to the chemistry of the system, can protect the concrete but do damage to the steel phase via mechanisms such as caustic embrittlement.

40|$|External {{corrosion}} of buried {{carbon steel}} pipes {{is a problem}} of global proportions, affecting a wide range of industries and services. Many factors affect corrosion rates. Biofilms may secrete enzymes and compounds that attack metal, alter local acidity and create <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> and galvanic <b>cells.</b> An important consideration is that biofilm metabolisms and enzymatic reactions are constantly in flux, altering the impact of microorganisms on corrosion rates, and thermodynamic equilibrium is not reached.

Several methods are used for corrosion studies but electrochemical techniques are the most commonly applied. Corrosion processes monitoring and control by means of non-destructive techniques, such as the implementation of embedded sensors, has been the target of many works.  It is possible to obtain relevant information of structural corrosion processes in real time. This document describes a system including specific equipment and which allows obtaining relevant information about these corrosion processes. This system is formed by a sensor network. There are several types of electrodes, which are distributed throughout the structure under study and a specific equipment developed by the research group, which is used to determine pertinent parameters such as the corrosion potential (Ecorr) and the corrosion density (icorr) by applying sequences of potentiostatic pulses. The system allows to reliably determine the corrosion rate in different areas of the structure. The sensor, due to its configuration, provides information of a specific area of the structure, but on the other hand it is involved in the galvanic events that can occur along the structure by <b>differential</b> <b>aeration,</b> galvanic <b>cells,</b> etc. because the sensor is not isolated from the structure.  This system also procures information of buried and submerged elements.

The corrosion of zinc and steel has been studied in relation to the presence of deposited particles derived from the combustion of oil (which may be comparable to diesel fuel) and coal [139].

Oil-ash particles were also found to be much more corrosive than coal-ash particles.

40|$|A new {{mechanistic}} {{model has been}} established for the chemical and electrochemical mechanisms controlling nickel–aluminium bronze crevice corrosion. The crevice corrosion was initially confined to eutectoid regions with slight attack of the copper rich ?-phase within the ?+?III eutectoid. In the presence of high chloride concentrations, copper and aluminium complexes form and the hydrolysis of these complexes leads to the acidification of the crevice solution chemistry. As the crevice solution becomes increasingly acidic the initial protection of the ?-phases due to their higher aluminium contents is lost and become anodic to the ?-phase. The continuous nature of the ?III-phase makes it vulnerable with an 80 ?m depth of attack after only the first month which is accompanied by internal copper redeposited at cathodic sites. Crevice corrosion of copper-based alloys is often reported {{to be controlled by}} a copper-ion concentration cell, however, for nickel–aluminium bronze it appears that primarily the crevice corrosion propagation results from a combined action of localised acidification and <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> between the bold and occluded zones. This mechanistic understanding provides further insights in to the development of crevice corrosion experienced by nickel–aluminium bronze after long-term exposures to natural seawater for up to 3 years. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{microbial}} communities {{associated with}} different corrosion deposit layers retrieved from a harbour steel structure affected by ALWC (Accelerated Low Water Corrosion) {{were determined by}} 16 S rDNA PCR-DGGE analysis. Comparative analysis of populations associated with ALWC layers and NLWC (Normal Low Water Corrosion) layers evidenced clear differences in the structure and composition of the communities. Dominant phylotypes related to sulphate-reducing bacteria pertaining to Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae were identified in both type of deposits (fraction of 52 % and 44 % of the total NLWC and ALWC communities, respectively). Phylotypes related to sulphur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to Alpha-, Gamma- and Epsilonproteobacteria were unique to ALWC deposits, while phylotypes related to oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms (cyanobacteria, diatoms) were only retrieved in NLWC deposits. This suggested that biologically-mediated sulphur cycle was the dominant process within ALWC deposits vs. chemically-mediated sulphur cycle within NLWC deposits. Since most of the members identified are heterotrophs, it is speculated that organic carbon may be available through water pollution and/or proliferation of photosynthetic biomass.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for measuring localized corrosion under disbonded coatings {{by means of}} an electrochemical sensor, denoted <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> sensor (DAS). It measures the distribution of electrochemical currents over an electrode array surface partially covered by a crevice that simulates a disbonded coating. The DAS has been evaluated using immersion tests at open circuit and under cathodic protection (CP) conditions. Under both conditions, anodic as well as cathodic current densities were detected within the crevice. A fundamental understanding for the detection of anodic currents under CP has been explained in terms of basic electrochemistry. Based on the current distribution data provided by the sensor, two different analysis methods have been used to estimate corrosion and its distribution. These methods consisted of a direct application of Faraday 2 ̆ 7 s Law to the anodic currents detected by the array, and on a sensor-specific method denoted corrected currents 2 ̆ 7 method. It has been demonstrated that under diffusion controlled conditions this latter method produces a better corrosion estimation than the direct application of Faraday 2 ̆ 7 s Law. The corrected currents 2 ̆ 7 method allowed the estimation of corrosion patterns outside the crevice under CP. Good correlation between electrochemical calculations and surface profilometry results has been obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{corrosion}} loss of {{mild steel}} {{in the marine}} tidal zone varies considerably with elevation relative to mean tide. Classical studies on steel piles and electrically isolated coupons show quite different vertical corrosion profiles. This usually is attributed {{to the effect of}} <b>differential</b> <b>aeration.</b> In many practical applications, steel structures may be confined to just part of the tidal zone or may extend only partly into either the atmospheric zone or the immersion zone. This paper presents mass-loss profiles for steel strips of different lengths (0. 20, 0. 50, 1. 0, and 3 m) exposed at various elevations in the atmospheric, tidal, and immersion zones at Jervis Bay, Australia, where the tidal range is around 1. 2 m. Relatively little difference in the corrosion profile was observed in the corrosion profiles for 100 -mm-long coupons and for the shorter strips, mainly because each strip or coupon was confined to exposure only in a single zone. However, very high, localized corrosion was observed for a 1 -m strip with the lower end extending just into the immersion zone. The 3 -m-long strip and the individual coupons, all extending from the immersion zone to the atmospheric zone, displayed corrosion loss profiles generally consistent with those reported in classical studies...|$|R

Interstitial Free Steel (I. F.) of 1. 2 mm thickness was joined to Aluminium 5754 of 2 mm thickness and Aluminium 5182 (coated and uncoated) of 1. 5 mm thickness. The work began by initially conducting a quality assessment of the various joints that were produced in order to establish the optimum conditions for joining the various sample combinations to be investigated. A relationship was established between the head height and the interlock distance {{on the one hand and}} between the interlock distance and the lap shear strength of samples. It was also established that for higher lap shear strength, it is preferable to use the stronger material (I. F. steel) as the pierced sheet and the weaker material (5182) as the locked sheet. However, the results showed that this rule could not be applied for predicting the fatigue behaviour of SPR joints between I. F. steel and 5182. An investigation of the fatigue failure mechanisms was undertaken and possible reasons for this behaviour are discussed. The influence of fretting was also investigated by using scanning electron microscopy and reported. The fatigue behaviour of Dual Phase (DP 600 + 5182) SPR joints was investigated. It was observed that the position of fatigue crack initiation differed with the maximum applied load. An explanation for this observation was provided by considering the failure mechanism of the samples under different load levels. The study also showed how fretting led to the initiation of fatigue cracks. The corrosion behaviour of (I.

Previous experiments have demonstrated that although mutants lacking CheB and/or CheR homologs from this pathway are defective in chemotaxis, a mutant in which the entire chemotaxis pathway has been mutated displayed a chemotaxis phenotype mostly {{similar to that of}} the parent strain, suggesting that the primary function of this Che 1 pathway is not the control of motility behavior. Here, we report that mutants carrying defined mutations in the cheA 1 (strain AB 101) and the cheY 1 (strain AB 102) genes and a newly constructed mutant lacking the entire operon [Δ(cheA 1 -cheR 1) ::Cm] (strain AB 103) were defective, but not null, for chemotaxis and aerotaxis and had a minor defect in swimming pattern. We found that mutations in genes of the Che 1 pathway affected the cell length of actively growing cells but not their growth rate. Cells of a mutant lacking functional cheB 1 and cheR 1 genes (strain BS 104) were significantly longer than wild-type cells, whereas cells of mutants impaired in the cheA 1 or cheY 1 genes, as well as a mutant lacking a functional Che 1 pathway, were significantly shorter than wild-type cells. Both the modest chemotaxis defects and the observed differences in cell length could be complemented by expressing the wild-type genes from a plasmid. In addition, under conditions of high <b>aeration,</b> <b>cells</b> of mutants lacking functional cheA 1 or cheY 1 genes or the Che 1 operon formed clumps due to cell-to-cell aggregation, whereas the mutant lacking functional CheB 1 and CheR 1 (BS 104) clumped poorly, if at all. Further analysis suggested that the nature of the exopolysaccharide produced, rather than the amount, may be involved in this behavior. Interestingly, mutants that displayed clumping behavior (lacking cheA 1 or cheY 1 genes or the Che 1 operon) also flocculated earlier and quantitatively more than the wild-type cells, whereas the mutant lacking both CheB 1 and CheR 1 was delayed in flocculation. We propose that the Che 1 chemotaxis-like pathway modulates the cell length as well as clumping behavior, suggesting a link between these two processes. Our data are consistent with a model in which the function of the Che 1 pathway in regulating these cellular functions directly affects flocculation, a cellular differentiation process initiated under conditions of nutritional imbalance...|$|R

Current investigation assessed the impact of one of such factors, the speed of <b>aeration,</b> on <b>cell</b> viability and culturability of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp. and Bacillus spp. Each of the bacterial strain was incubated at 37 °C with a shaking speed of 0, 100 or 200 rotation per minute (rpm) separately up to 72 hours, with a simultaneous monitoring of morphological changes and cell culturability. All bacterial species were found to optimally grow at 100 rpm whereas at 0 rpm growths of E. coli and Pseudomonas spp. were bit slower {{compared to that of}} Bacillus spp. The capacity to form colony forming units (CFUs) of E. coli and Pseudomonas spp. on Luria Burtani (LB) agar plates were observed to be inhibited after 36 hours of growth at 200 rpm; i. e., approximately 3 -log reduced CFUs than those formed by Bacillus spp. Besides, morphologically impaired cells were observed for the former two bacteria cultivated at 200 rpm. Taken together, it is assumed that the high speed shaking might evolve the oxidative stress endogenously which possibly rendered the cells lose their culturability...|$|R
40|$|The psbO gene of cyanobacteria, {{green algae}} and higher plants encodes the {{precursor}} of the 33 kDa manganese-stabilizing protein (MSP), a water-soluble subunit of photosystem II (PSII). Using a pET-T 7 cloning/expression system, we have expressed in Escherichia coli a full-length cDNA clone of psbO from Arabidopsis thaliana. Upon induction, {{high levels of}} the precursor protein accumulated in cells grown with vigorous <b>aeration.</b> In <b>cells</b> grown under weak aeration, the mature protein accumulated upon induction. In cells grown with moderate aeration, the ratio of precursor to mature MSP decreased as the optical density at induction increased. Both forms of the protein accumulated as inclusion bodies from which the mature protein could be released under mildly denaturing conditions that did not release the precursor. Renatured Arabidopsis MSP was 87 % as effective as isolated spinach MSP in restoring O 2 evolution activity to MSP-depleted PSII membranes from spinach; however, the heterologous protein binds to spinach PSIIs with about half the affinity of the native protein. We also report a correction to the previously published DNA sequence of Arabidopsis psbO (Ko et al., Plant Mol Biol 14 (1990) 217 – 227) ...|$|R
40|$|Increase air {{pressure}} for <b>aeration</b> of microbial <b>cell</b> cultures can prevent oxygen limitation but cause oxidative stress and consequently affect cell physiology. A pressurized bioreactor {{was used for}} Y. lipolytica batch cultivation under increased {{air pressure}} up to 6 bar and no inhibition of cell growth was observed. Moreover, an increase of 6 -fold led to a 3. 4 -fold increase in specific growth rate under atmospheric pressure. The antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase was induced by the air pressure raise, which indicates that the defensive mechanisms of the cells were effective and cells could cope with increased pressure. The extracellular lipase activity increased from 22. 3 to 43. 7 U/l using a 5 -bar air pressure instead of air at 1 bar pressure...|$|R
40|$|Decalactones are {{interesting}} flavouring compounds {{that can be}} produced from ricinoleic acid. In this study, the production of lactones in biofilms using Yarrowia lipolytica is investigated. The hydrophobia of cells increased for increased aeration rates resulting in higher adhesion when the reactor wall was hydrophobic (plastic). To increase adhesion, sheets of methyl-polymethacrylate (PMMA) were added in the reactor {{and the production of}} lactones increased with the surface of plastic added, reaching 850 mg/L of 3 -hydroxy- -decalactone for 60 cm 2. In an Airlift bioreactor made of PMMA, biofilms were present {{at the top of the}} reactor for increased aeration. In the meantime, a metabolic shift occurred resulting in high amounts of 3 -hydroxy- -decalactone. At 0. 493 vvm and 61 h of culture, the dissolved oxygen ratio was of 28. 6 % and cells grew to only 1. 29 × 106 cells/mL in the liquid medium but 3 -hydroxy -decalactone accumulated to 1. 7 g/L instead of less than 0. 3 mg/L for lower <b>aeration.</b> Adhering <b>cells</b> had a particular elongated shape intermediate between the yeast and the pseudofilamentous forms. It is concluded that adhering Y. lipolytica cells are in a specific physiological state changing their structure but also their metabolic properties and these properties make them good candidate for simple immobilisation process.
