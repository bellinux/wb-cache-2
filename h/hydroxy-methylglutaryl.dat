40|$|A {{therapy for}} {{hypertension}} and statin-induced myalgia? Some small clinical trials seem {{to show that}} coenzyme Q 10 supplements {{can be used to}} lower blood pressure and to treat or prevent myalgia caused by <b>hydroxy-methylglutaryl</b> coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). However, larger trials are needed to determine if they are truly effective for these purposes. The authors examine the evidence and also discuss issues such as bioavailabil-ity, elimination, safety, and cost. ■ KEY POINTS In some clinical trials, coenzyme Q 10 supplements sig-nificantly lowered diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Statins may lower coenzyme Q 10 serum levels, and som...|$|E
40|$|The Rho GTPases are {{involved}} in actin cytoskeleton organiza-tion and signal transduction. They need polyisoprenylation for membrane association and activation. Lovastatin, a <b>hydroxy-methylglutaryl</b> coenzyme A inhibitor, prevents isoprene synthe-sis and thereby lipid modification of the Rho protein carboxy terminus. Because lovastatin causes rounding up of cultured cells, we investigated whether the compound acts on the actin cytoskeleton through Rho proteins. Lovastatin treatment de-creased F-actin content in a time- and concentration-depen-dent manner. G-actin content remained unchanged. In lovas-tatin-treated NIH 3 T 3 cells, the amount of Rho protein which was ADP-ribosylated by Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C 3 decreased in membranes and increased in the cytosol fraction. Cycloheximide prevented lovastatin-induced rounding up o...|$|E
40|$|Inflammation {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. It has been suggested that the beneficial effects of <b>hydroxy-methylglutaryl</b> coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors on survival of patients with ischaemic heart disease may partly derive from their anti-inflammatory properties. Aim of the study was to determine levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I (sTNF-RI) in patients with hypercholesterolaemia and angina pectoris, in a group of asymptomatic subjects (n = 20) with elevated serum cholesterol levels and in a control group (n = 20). Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the possible influence of 3 -month treatment with simvastatin on plasma concentrations of sTNF-RI. Results: Baseline concentrations of sTNF-RI in plasma were significantly higher in patients with hypercholesterolaemia and angina pectoris compared to the control group (1259 ± 90 pg/ml vs. 913 ± 98 pg/ml, p = 0. 0366). Baseline sTNF-RI levels in hypercholesterolaemic subjects (1004 ± 92 pg/ml) were not significantly different from those in patients with angina pectoris or controls. In both study groups simvastatin had n...|$|E
40|$|CD 147 is an {{activation}} induced glycoprotein {{that promotes}} the secretion and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and is upregulated during the differentiation of macrophages. Interestingly, {{some of the}} molecular functions of CD 147 rely on its glycosylation status: the highly glycosylated forms of CD 147 induce MMPs whereas the lowly glycosylated forms inhibit MMP activation. Statins are <b>hydroxy-methylglutaryl</b> coenzyme A reductase inhibitors that block the synthesis of mevalonate, thereby inhibiting all mevalonate-dependent pathways, including isoprenylation, N-glycosylation and cholesterol synthesis. In this study, we investigated the role of statins in the inhibition of macrophage differentiation and the associated process of MMP secretion through modulation of CD 147. We observed that differentiation of the human monocytic cell line THP- 1 to a macrophage phenotype led to upregulation of CD 147 and CD 14 and that this effect was inhibited by statins. At the molecular level, statins altered CD 147 expression, structure and function by inhibiting isoprenylation and N-glycosylation. In addition, statins induced a shift of CD 147 from its highly glycosylated form to its lowly glycosylated form. This shift in N-glycosylation status {{was accompanied by a}} decrease in the production and functional activity of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9. In conclusion, these findings describe a novel molecular mechanism of immune regulation by statins, making them interesting candidates for autoimmune disease therapy...|$|E
40|$|Cholesteryl ester {{storage disease}} (CESD) is {{characterized}} by the deficient activity of lysosomal cholesteryl ester (CE) hy-drolase, accumulation of LDL-derived CE in lysosomes, and hyperlipidemia. We studied the kinetics of VLDL and LDL apolipoprotein B (apoB), using 125 I-VLDL and " 1 I-LDL, in a 9 -yr-old female with CESD and elevated total cholesterol (TC) (271. 0 ± 4. 4 mg/dl), triglyceride (TG) (150. 0 ± 7. 8 mg/dl), and LDL cholesterol (184. 7 ± 3. 4 mg/dl). These studies demon-strated a markedly elevated production rate (PR) of apoB, primarily in LDL, with normal fractional catabolism of apoB in VLDL and LDL. Urine mevalonate levels were elevated, indicative of increased synthesis of endogenous cholesterol. Treatment with lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of <b>hydroxy-methylglutaryl</b> coenzyme A reductase, resulted in significant reductions in TC (196. 8 ± 7. 9 mg/dl), TG (100. 8 ± 20. 6 mg/dl), and LDL cholesterol (102. 0 ± 10. 9 mg/dl). Therapy reduced VLDL apoB PR (5. 2 vs. 12. 2 mg/kg per d pretreatment) and LDL apoB PR (12. 7 vs. 24. 2 mg/kg per d pretreatment). Urine mevalonate levels also decreased during therapy. These results indicate that, in CESD, the inability to release free cholesterol from lysosomal CE resulted in elevated synthesis of endoge-nous cholesterol and increased production of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Lovastatin reduced both the rate of cholesterol synthesis and the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that a {{membrane}} p-glyco-protein, encoded by MDR 1 gene, is involved in the transport of free cholesterol from the plasma membrane to endoplasmic reticulum, the site of cholesterol esterification by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). Moreover, results deriving from our previous {{studies have shown}} that the rate of cell proliferation was positively correlated with cholesteryl ester levels as well as with ACAT and MDR 1 gene expression. In this study, lipid content and the expression of the genes involved in cholesterol metabolism such as <b>hydroxy-methylglutaryl</b> coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA-R), low-density lipo-protein receptor (LDL-R), ACAT and MDR 1 have been investigated in control and atherosclerotic arteries. The results have shown that the levels of cholesteryl ester increase with the age of cadaveric donors in arteries prone to atherosclerosis (abdominal aorta, superficial femoral artery) and become predominant in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. The mRNA levels of ACAT and MDR 1 showed the same age correlation, reaching the highest values in atherosclerotic specimens. These results suggest that MDR 1 may be involved in the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol ester levels found in atherosclerotic lesions. Moreover, the levels of HMGCoA-R, LDL-R and ACAT gene expressions progressively increased with the age of cadaveric donors; conversely, in atherosclerotic specimens, the mRNA levels of HMGCoA-R and LDL-R drastically decreased while ACAT gene expression reached its maximum. These findings suggest a reactivation of normal homeostatic regulation of cholesterol in advanced and complicated lesions...|$|E
40|$|Although a {{beneficial}} effect of <b>hydroxy-methylglutaryl</b> coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, i. e. statins, on cell-mediated immunity {{has been suggested}} in vivo and in vitro, {{little is known about}} the molecular and biochemical events by which statins inhibit T cell proliferation. To address this question, we investigated the effects of atorvastatin (AT) on intracellular cytokine production, T cell activation markers, cell cycle progression and apoptosis in human CD 4 + T cells. AT did not influence intracellular cytokine production after short-term stimulation of whole blood with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) /ionomycin or superantigen (SEB). In contrast, AT influenced CD 45 RA to RO switching dose-dependently, as well as CD 25 expression, and caused cell cycle arrest in the G 1 phase after long-term T cell stimulation. This occurred in conjunction with a reduced expression of cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4 and p 21 wav 1 /cip 1 and was paralleled by an increased protein expression of p 27 kip 1. In addition to G 1 arrest, increased apoptosis was observed in AT-treated cells. In line with this, the expression of Bcl-xl and pBad were decreased by AT. Apoptosis was independent of caspases 3 and 9 activation. The inhibitory effect of AT on T cell proliferation could be overcome by addition of mevalonic acid or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not by farnesyl pyrophosphate or squalen, suggesting reduced protein prenylation. Activation of Rho, Rac and Ras were strongly reduced in AT-treated T cells, suggesting that impaired geranylation of these molecules might underlie the inhibitory effect of AT on T cell proliferation...|$|E
40|$|Ezetimibe, a 2 -azetidione, {{is a novel}} agent used in thetreatment of hypercholesterolemia. While its exact {{mechanism}} of action has not been fully elucidated, ezetim-ibe is postulated to prevent the absorption of cholesterol from both dietary and biliary sources via a cholesterol transporter in the brush border of the intestinal wall. 1 Recent {{data suggest that the}} Niemann-Pick C 1 Like 1 protein or the annexin 2 caveolin 1 complex may be the molecular targets of ezetim-ibe. 2, 3 It is also thought to facilitate cholesterol removal by up-regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptors. 1 This new agent is currently indicated as adjunctive ther-apy to diet for treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and homozygous sitosterolemia as monotherapy and for primary hypercholesterolemia and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in combination with a <b>hydroxy-methylglutaryl</b> coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin). 1 Clinical trials have shown that ezetimibe monotherapy de-creases plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by 16 – 19 % compared with placebo and in com-bination with a statin decreases LDL-C levels by 12 – 25 % compared with a statin alone. 4, 5 Ezetimibe has also been shown to have beneficial effects on high-density lipopro-tein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B levels. It is generally well tolerated, with adverse events similar to those seen in the placebo group when used as monotherapy. Hepatic- and muscle-related event rates were similar to those with statin monotherapy when used in combination. 4, 5 Ezetimibe undergoes extensive metabolism, primarily by glucuronidation in the intestinal wall. 6 Owing to its lim...|$|E
40|$|Objective: It {{is unclear}} {{at the present}} time whether <b>hydroxy-methylglutaryl</b> {{coenzyme}} A reductase inhibitors (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors; statins) exert a protective effect on low-density lipoproteins (LDL) oxidation in vivo. In addition, it is speculated that pharmacological differences between statins may account for differences in their antioxidative capacities. This is of clinical relevance, because there is strong evidence that oxidized LDL initiates the atherosclerosis process. Material and methods: In a controlled, randomized, double-blind study we compared the effects of three different statins (simvastatin, pravastatin and atorvastatin) on the ability to protect LDL from oxidation in 70 hypercholesterolemic but otherwise healthy subjects. Statins were adininistered in doses which were nearly equi-effective in lowering LDL-cholesterol. Changes in LDL oxidation were measured using diene conjugation (DIENES) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) at entry and three months after beginning therapy with the statins. Results: Levels of DIENES, usually generated during the early phases of lipid peroxidation, were significantly reduced by 10. 2 +/- 5. 5 % (mean +/- SEM; p 0. 23). Levels of TBARS, reflecting late phases of LDL oxidation, showed no significant changes against baseline (p > 0. 34). Pooled data (n = 70) indicated that statins reduce DIENES levels by 90 % versus baseline (p 0. 29) after three months of therapy. Conclusion: This study showed that atorvastatin and pravastatin were capable of protecting LDL from oxidation in vivo in the early treatment phase. Pooled data levels of DIENES were significantly affected by statin therapy over a period of 3 months. No protective effect appeared to be present in the late phases of oxidation evaluated using measurement of TBARS but {{it should be noted that}} the clinical impact of such observations are currently discussed controversially in the literature...|$|E
