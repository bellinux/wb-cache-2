5|$|Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone {{as well as}} by its erratic, fantastical and {{fast-moving}} plot. A picaresque novel with a story {{similar to}} that of a more serious coming-of-age narrative (Bildungsroman), it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the Seven Years' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.|$|E
25|$|Narration describes, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> is {{at times}} enraptured {{and at other}} times pointedly cynical, Angelica's first visit to the Prince and his family {{following}} her betrothal to Tancredi. Dressed beautifully, she makes her entrance with perfect timing, and immediately endears herself to the Prince. Only Bendicò, growling in a corner, seems unhappy to see her. Finally, narration also describes how Angelica, as she's listening, coolly considers the financial and sexual prosperity that awaits them, and comments that, within a few years of the marriage, Angelica will become one of the great political kingmakers of the Italian Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|Her {{characteristic}} dimple {{has been}} cited by the media as her trademark. At {{the beginning of her}} career, she was often described by the press as having a vivacious personality and a bubbly, outgoing persona, an image she had confessed to disliking. According to film critic Sukanya Verma, Zinta's energetic nature extends from her real life into her appearances in films and {{is an integral part of}} her technique. In an article discussing Hindi film actresses and their flair for comedy, Verma wrote, [...] "What can you say about an actress who giggles non-stop <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> is anything but prim and propah? She is carefree. She is animated. She talks non-stop. She laughs all the time. She has a chilled out sense of humour. And a tomboyish streak too. Preity Zinta is all that and more. All this greatly contributes to her style of acting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Each {{publication}} he sent had {{a personal}} letter enclosed in order to portray him as an English patriot performing his duty. [...] His objective was to gain the trust of Americans by appearing friendly and honest. [...] He wrote <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> suggested he was {{a supporter of the}} British cause, but desired to promote international understanding, and that he was open to hearing all viewpoints. This tactic convinced many Americans that their role in the war was important, and many sympathized with the British cause {{as a result of his}} efforts.|$|E
2500|$|Many Synod fathers {{stressed}} the need for the Church to speak <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> was positive, clear, simple, and which upheld the ideal family life as one that was obtainable. [...] Irish Archbishop Diarmuid Martin said that [...] "repeating doctrinal formulations alone will not bring the gospel and the good news of the family into an antagonistic society. We have to find a language which helps our young people to appreciate the newness and the challenge of the gospel." [...] Australian Archbishop Mark Coleridge agreed, saying [...] "crude and bleak readings" [...] of modern society [...] "are not what the doctor ordered." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Think for Yourself" [...] {{is a song}} by the English {{rock band}} the Beatles from their 1965 album Rubber Soul. It was written by George Harrison, the band's lead guitarist, and, {{together}} with [...] "If I Needed Someone", marked {{the start of his}} emergence as a songwriter beside John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The song's lyrics advocate independent thinking and reflect the Beatles' more sophisticated subject matter at this stage of their career. The lyrics have invited interpretation as both a political statement and a love song, as Harrison dismisses a lover or friend <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> some commentators liken to Bob Dylan's song [...] "Positively 4th Street". Among musicologists, the composition has been recognised as adventurous in the degree of tonal ambiguity it employs across parallel major and minor keys and through its suggestion of multiple musical modes.|$|E
