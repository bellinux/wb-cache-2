25|$|The structure-activity {{relationship}} of morphine {{has been extensively}} studied. As {{a result of the}} extensive study and use of this molecule, more than 250 morphine derivatives (also counting codeine and related drugs) have been developed since {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century. These drugs range from 25% the analgesic strength of codeine (or slightly more than 2% of the strength of morphine) to several thousand times the strength of morphine, to powerful opioid antagonists, including naloxone (Narcan), naltrexone (Trexan), <b>diprenorphine</b> (M5050, the reversing agent for the Immobilon dart) and nalorphine (Nalline). Some opioid agonist-antagonists, partial agonists, and inverse agonists are also derived from morphine. The receptor-activation profile of the semi-synthetic morphine derivatives varies widely and some, like apomorphine are devoid of narcotic effects.|$|E
25|$|Opioid effects (adverse or otherwise) can be {{reversed}} with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone or naltrexone. These competitive antagonists bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists {{but do not}} activate the receptors. This displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. However, the elimination half-life of naloxone can be shorter {{than that of the}} opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as nalmefene may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it is essential that the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and <b>diprenorphine</b> is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and carfentanil. However, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.|$|E
50|$|In theory, <b>diprenorphine</b> {{could also}} be used as an {{antidote}} for treating overdose of certain opioid derivatives which are used in humans, particularly buprenorphine for which the binding affinity is so high that naloxone does not reliably reverse the narcotic effects. However, <b>diprenorphine</b> is not generally available in hospitals; instead a vial of <b>diprenorphine</b> is supplied with etorphine or carfentanil specifically for reversing the effects of the drug, so the use of <b>diprenorphine</b> for treating a buprenorphine overdose is not usually carried out in practice.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diprenorphine</b> {{is used in}} {{veterinary}} medicine only.|$|E
50|$|The human {{antidote}} {{is generally}} naloxone, not <b>diprenorphine,</b> and is always prepared before {{the preparation of}} etorphine to be immediately administered following accidental human exposure to etorphine. The LD50 in humans is 30 μg {{which led to the}} requirement that the medicine include an equal dose of an antidote, <b>diprenorphine</b> or naloxone.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>diprenorphine</b> is a weak partial agonist of the opioid receptors {{rather than}} a silent antagonist, it can produce some opioid effects {{in the absence of}} other opioids at {{sufficient}} doses. Moreover, due to partial agonism of the KOR, where it appears to possess significantly greater intrinsic activity relative to the MOR, <b>diprenorphine</b> can produce sedation as well as, in humans, hallucinations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diprenorphine</b> is {{considered}} to be the specific reversing agent/antagonist for etorphine and carfentanil, and is normally used to remobilise animals once veterinary procedures have been completed. Since <b>diprenorphine</b> also has partial agonistic properties of its own, it should not be used on humans in the event that they are accidentally exposed to etorphine or carfentanil. Naloxone or naltrexone is the preferred human opioid receptor antagonist.|$|E
50|$|Etorphine is an {{extremely}} potent, non-selective full agonist of the μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors. It also has relatively weak affinity for the nociceptin receptor. Etorphine has an LD50 of 30μg in humans. Its mu affinity is 0.024nM compared with nalorphine nM 0.559Nm and <b>diprenorphine</b> 0.072kI so the compound naloxone would need large doses as it battles for space on receptors. <b>Diprenorphine</b> Carfentanil has a Ki of 0.0000007.|$|E
50|$|Addition of a two carbon group between carbons 6 and 14 (e.g., 6,14-ethano, 6,14-etheno, and 6,14-ethyno), {{and which}} {{significantly}} distorts the C ring, may increase potency 1,000 to 10,000 times, or greater, compared to morphine, as in etorphine, and others. The relative potency {{is thought to}} be associated with the degree of distortion of the C ring, and is perhaps greatest in <b>diprenorphine,</b> where this group is α,α-dimethyl-6,14-etheno. <b>Diprenorphine</b> (M5050) is the recommended etorphine (M99) antagonist, but it is not a pure opioid antagonist (i.e., it is also a weak opioid agonist), so naloxone remains a significant therapeutic tool in suspected cases of opioid overdose. See also Bentley compounds.|$|E
50|$|One of {{its main}} {{advantages}} is its speed of operation and, more importantly, {{the speed with which}} <b>diprenorphine</b> reverses the effects. The high incidence of side-effects, including severe cardiopulmonary depression, has caused etorphine to fall into disfavor in general veterinary practice. However, its high potency combined with the rapid action of both etorphine and its antagonist, <b>diprenorphine,</b> means that it has found a place for capture of large mammals such as rhinoceroses and elephants; under these circumstances both rapid onset and rapid recovery are very important characteristics. The high potency of etorphine means that sufficient etorphine can be administered to large wild mammals by projectile syringe (dart).|$|E
50|$|Cyprenorphine (M-285) is an opioid drug. It {{is related}} to more {{well-known}} opioids such as buprenorphine, which is used as an analgesic and {{for the treatment of}} opioid addiction, and <b>diprenorphine,</b> which is used as an antidote to reverse the effects of other opioids.|$|E
50|$|Large Animal Immobilon is a {{combination}} of etorphine plus acepromazine maleate. An etorphine antidote Large Animal Revivon contains mainly <b>diprenorphine</b> for animals and a human-specific naloxone-based antidote, which should be prepared prior to the etorphine. A 5-15 mg dose is enough to immobilize an African elephant and a 2-4 mg dose is enough to immobilize a Black Rhino.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diprenorphine</b> (brand name Revivon; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} M5050), {{also known as}} diprenorfin, is a non-selective, high-affinity, weak partial agonist of the μ- (MOR), κ- (KOR), and δ-opioid receptor (DOR) (with equal affinity) that is employed in veterinary medicine as an opioid antagonist. It is used to reverse the effects of super-potent opioid analgesics such as etorphine and carfentanil that are used for tranquilizing large animals. The drug is not approved for use in humans.|$|E
50|$|Etorphine is {{available}} legally only {{for veterinary use}} and is strictly governed by law. It {{is often used to}} immobilize elephants and other large mammals. <b>Diprenorphine</b> (M5050), also known as Revivon, is an opioid receptor antagonist that can be administered in proportion to the amount of etorphine used (1.3 times) to reverse its effects. Veterinary-strength etorphine is fatal to humans. For this reason the package as supplied to vets always includes the human antidote as well as etorphine.|$|E
50|$|Other notable {{derivatives}} then {{result from}} further modification of this template, with saturation of the 7,8-double bond of etorphine {{resulting in the}} even more potent dihydroetorphine (up to 12,000× potency of morphine) and acetylation of the 3-hydroxy group of etorphine resulting in acetorphine (8700× morphine)—although while the isopentyl homologue of etorphine is nearly three times more potent, its 7,8-dihydro and 3-acetyl derivatives are less potent than the corresponding derivatives of etorphine at 11000× and 1300× morphine respectively. Replacing the N-methyl group with cyclopropylmethyl results in opioid antagonists such as <b>diprenorphine</b> (M5050, which is used {{as an antidote to}} reverse the effects of etorphine, M99), and partial agonists such as buprenorphine, which is widely used in the treatment of opioid addiction.|$|E

50|$|<b>Diprenorphine</b> is {{the strongest}} opioid {{antagonist}} that is commercially available (some 100 times more potent as an antagonist than nalorphine), and is used for reversing the effects of very strong opioids for which the binding affinity is so high that naloxone does not effectively or reliably reverse the narcotic effects. These super-potent opioids, with the single exception of buprenorphine (which has an improved safety-profile due to its partial agonism character), are not used in humans because the dose for a human is so small {{that it would be}} difficult to measure properly, so there is an excessive risk of overdose leading to fatal respiratory depression. However conventional opioid derivatives are not strong enough to rapidly tranquilize large animals, like elephants and rhinos, so drugs such as etorphine and carfentanil are available for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Finally, opioid effects (adverse or otherwise) can be {{reversed}} with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone or naltrexone.

40|$|Subcutaneous {{injection}} of the potent, nonselective opioid antagonist <b>diprenorphine</b> inhibits the vasopressin response to acute hypovolemia. To determine if this inhibition {{is due to}} antagonism of opioid receptors in brain pathways that mediate volume control, we determined the vasopressin response to different stimuli when <b>diprenorphine</b> or other opiates were injected into the cerebral ventricles, the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), or the lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBN) of rats. We found that the vasopressin response to hypovolemia was inhibited by {{injection of}} <b>diprenorphine</b> into the cerebral ventricles at a dose too low to be effective when given subcutaneously. This response also was inhibited when a 20 -fold lower dose of <b>diprenorphine</b> was injected into the PBN but not when it was injected into the NTS. The inhibitory effect of <b>diprenorphine</b> in the PBN was not attributable to a decrease in osmotic or hypovolemic stimulation and did not occur with osmotic or hypotensive stimuli.

40|$|Substitute {{methadone}} prescribing {{is one of}} {{the main}} modes of treatment for opioid dependence with established evidence for improved health and social outcomes. However, the pharmacology underpinning the effects of methadone is little studied despite controversies about dosing in relation to outcome. We therefore examined the relationship between methadone dose and occupation of opioid receptors in brain using the positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C- 11] <b>diprenorphine</b> in humans and rats. Eight opioid-dependent subjects stable on their substitute methadone (18 - 90 mg daily) had an [C- 11] <b>diprenorphine</b> PET scan at predicted peak plasma levels of methadone. These were compared with eight healthy controls. No difference in [C- 11] <b>diprenorphine</b> binding was found between the groups, with no relationship between methadone dose and occupancy. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats that had been given an acute i. v. injection of methadone hydrochloride (0. 35, 0. 5, 0. 7, or 1. 0 mg kg(- 1)) before [C- 11] <b>diprenorphine</b> showed a dose-dependent increase in biodistribution but no reduction in [C- 11] <b>diprenorphine</b> binding. We suggest that the lack of a dose-dependent relationship between methadone dose, either given chronically in human or acutely in rat, and occupancy of opioid receptor measured with [C- 11] <b>diprenorphine</b> PET is related to efficacy of this opioid agonist at very low levels of opioid receptor occupancy. This has implications for understanding the actions of methadone in comparison with other opioid drugs such as partial agonists and antagonists...|$|E

40|$|The neuroanatomical and {{pathophysiological}} {{basis of}} primary generalised absences is uncertain. Administration of endogenous opioids {{has been shown}} to result in absence-like seizures in animal models. Positron emission tomography scans were performed in eight patients with primary generalised epilepsy and eight control subjects. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured interictally with C 15 O 2, after which a 90 minute dynamic study with the opioid-receptor ligand 11 C-diprenorphine was performed. Serial absences were precipitated by hyperventilation for 10 minutes, starting 30 - 40 minutes after injection of <b>diprenorphine.</b> Absences, with generalised spike-wave discharges on the EEG, occurred for between 10 % and 51 % of the provocation period. No individual (normal or patient) had any interictal focal abnormalities of cerebral blood flow. After provocation of serial absence seizures, there was increased <b>diprenorphine</b> elimination from the association cortex, but not from the thalamus, basal ganglia, or cerebellum, compared with control subjects and patients scanned without provocation of absences. It was possible to simulate the observed increased <b>diprenorphine</b> elimination following seizures in cerebral cortex using a two tissue compartment model, with an estimated 15 - 41 % decrease in the specific tracer uptake rate constant (k 3). These results suggest that endogenous opioids are released in the association cortex at the time of serial absences, lead to increased receptor occupancy, and may have {{an important role in the}} pathophysiology of generalised absences...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} rigid opiates {{have been chosen}} for {{experimental}} electron density studies spanning a range of activities from potent agonist (morphine, codeine) to potent antagonist (<b>diprenorphine</b> and now naltrexone). The experimental electron density distribution of naltrexon has been determined from 182297 Bragg reflections (27082 unique) collected at 100 K and CCD area detection at the beamline F 1. Although the scattering power of the crystal was low a resolution of 1. 22 Å− 1 in sin θ/λ (d= 0. 41 Å) was achieved thanks to the high primary beam intensity. The newly installed MarCCD area detector allows 3 ◦ scans in ϕ so that the measuring time is reduced dramatically. This dataset was refined with the program package XD [1] using the aspherical atom multipole formalism according to the method of Hansen and Coppens [2]. A full topological analysis {{was performed on the}} resulting model electron density followed by a partitioning making use of the zero flux surfaces of the electron density gradient vector field according to the ”atom in molecule”-theory of R. F. W. Bader [3]. To evaluate the atomic volumes and charges the program TOPXD [4] was used. The table below contains a comparison of ρ and ∇ 2 ρ at the bond critical points. The agreement between the electron density of naltrexon and <b>diprenorphine</b> is very good for chemically equivalent bonds, while for example for C 6 –O 2 the different nature of this bond for the two compounds is clearly indicated.

40|$|To date no problem-free method {{exists for}} the {{immobilisation}} of free‑ranging walruses (Odobenus rosmarus). In the period 1989 - 2001, 69 immobilisations with etorphine HCl were performed by remote darting of 41 individual free-ranging adult Atlantic walruses (O. r. rosmarus), with body masses 633  ‑  1883  kg, as a rerequisite for the attachment of radio tracking and dive recording instruments, and for studies of metabolism. Ten individuals were immobilised several times. We present data on these 69 immobilisations {{and evaluate the}} method. Full immobilisation was achieved in 58 cases (84  %). The animals were insufficiently restrained in 6 cases (9  %) and 5 animals died (7  %) following the immobilisation. The animals were fully immobilised and approachable after 5  min (n =  38, range = 1. 9 ‑ 12. 4 min, SD = 2. 2) with a dose of etorphine of 6. 1  μg/kg (range 2. 4  ‑  12. 6  μg /kg, SD =  2. 4). Induction time was negatively correlated with the dosage of etorphine. Etorphine-induced apnoea lasted 13. 7  min (n = 36, range  17. 0  ‑ 26. 7  min, SD = 5. 1) and was reversed by multiple doses of the antagonist <b>diprenorphine</b> HCl. The first dose of antagonist of 12. 2  mg (n = 39, range  6. 0  ‑ 21. 0  mg, SD = 3. 5) was administered 8. 4  min (n = 38, range  4. 7  ‑ 18. 0  min, SD = 2. 8) after injection of the agonist. The total dose of <b>diprenorphine</b> per animal ranged between 7. 7 and 41. 7  μg/kg (n = 31, mean = 17. 2  μg/kg, SD = 7. 5). For some animals blood pH values were measured following the apnoea and reached low levels (min pH 6. 8). For animals that were immobilised several times there were no indications of changed sensitivity to etorphine as reflected in unchanged induction times. Mortalities could neither {{be related to the}} doses of agonist and antagonist, nor to the times of administration of the drugs. From this (n = 69) and other (n = 103) studies involving etorphine immobilisation of walruses (both Atlantic and Pacific) the overall success rate is 83  % (8  % casualty rate). We conclude that the combination etorphine‑ <b>diprenorphine</b> is suitable for both single and multiple immobilisations of walruses provided that (a) a casualty rate of 7 - 8 % is acceptable (b) the antagonist <b>diprenorphine</b> is administered fast and well into a tissue with good blood irrigation, and (c) the animal is promptly intubated endotracheally to facilitate the restoration of breathing after drug-induced apnoea...|$|E
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{effects of}} etorphine, and etorphine combined with xylazine and etorphine combined with azaperone on respiratory and cardiovascular function were determined in. Boer goats. The goats were habituated {{to the experimental}} procedures allowing the determination of respiratory and cardiovascular function while the animals stood quietly at rest. This resulted in the physiological changes induced by the three immobilizing drugs being measured and compared with those obtained prior to {{the administration of the}} immobilizing drugs. The: effectiveness of <b>diprenorphine</b> and atipamezole in antagonising the physiological changes induced by the immobilizing drug treatments was also determined. All three immobilizing drug treatments depressed respiratory function resulting in a decrease in PaO 2 and an increase in PaCO 2. Etorphine caused limited changes to these blood gases as a result of decreases in respiratory minute volume and alveolar minute ventilation caused by a fall in respiratory rate. The administration of etorphine / azaperone did not decrease the efficiency of respiration more significantly than when etorphine was administered on its own. Etorphine injected in combination with xylazine resulted in a severe decrease in respiratory function. The decrease in PaO 2 and the increase in PaCO 2 were much greater than the changes to these two blood gases following the administration of either etorphine or etorphine in combination with azaperone. Compared to etorphine administered on its own, etorphine combined with xylazine caused more significant decreases in tidal volume and alveolar minute ventilation, and more significant elevations in both physiological shunt fraction and percentage dead space ventilation. The administration of etorphine, etorphine / xylazine and etorphine / azaperone caused three different sets of changes to cardiovascular function. The injection of etorphine resulted in significant increases in both total peripheral resistance and systemic mean arterial blood pressure, and a significant decease in cardiac output. The administration of etorphine / xylazine resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in the systemic mean arterial blood pressure, followed by a decrease in cardiac output. The peripheral resistance remained unchanged. Etorphine / azaperone caused a progressive decline in the total peripheral resistance. As the cardiac output did not change significantly, the systemic mean arterial blood pressure fell progressively. The administration of etorphine resulted in a gradual and limited decrease in the oxygen consumption index. Following the injection of etorphine / xylazine a rapid and significant decrease in the oxygen consumption index resulted, which was significantly lower, when compared to the goats immobilized with etorphine, at 5 and 35 minutes PDA. The injection of etorphine / azaperone resulted in a gradual decrease in the oxygen consumption index which reached a minimum value at 35 minutes PDA. At this time, the oxygen consumption index due to etorphine / xylazine was not significantly different from the value due to etorphine / azaperone. <b>Diprenorphine</b> effectively reversed the respiratory and cardiovascular effects due to etorphine. The physiological changes induced by the administration of etorphine / xylazine were partially and temporarily antagonised by the administration of <b>diprenorphine,</b> it was only following the injection of atipamezole that they return to the values measured in the goats prior to immobilization. <b>Diprenorphine</b> effectively reversed the respiratory depression induced by etorphine / azaperone, however a mild acidosis persisted {{until the end of the}} trial period.

40|$|Understanding the {{cellular}} processes underpinning {{the changes in}} binding observed during positron emission tomography neurotransmitter release studies may aid translation of these methodologies to other neurotransmitter systems. We compared the sensitivities of opioid receptor radioligands, carfentanil, and <b>diprenorphine,</b> to amphetamine-induced endogenous opioid peptide (EOP) release and methadone administration in the rat. We also investigated whether agonist-induced internalization was involved in reductions in observed binding using subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy. After radioligand administration, significant reductions in [(11) C]carfentanil, but not [(3) H]diprenorphine, uptake were observed after methadone and amphetamine pretreatment. Subcellular fractionation and in vitro radioligand binding studies showed that amphetamine pretreatment only decreased total [(11) C]carfentanil binding. In vitro saturation binding studies conducted in buffers representative of the internalization pathway suggested that μ-receptors are significantly less able to bind the radioligands in endosomal compared with extracellular compartments. Finally, {{a significant increase in}} μ-receptor-early endosome co-localization in the hypothalamus was observed after amphetamine and methadone treatment using double-labeling confocal microscopy, with no changes in δ- or κ-receptor co-localization.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to compare the {{capacity}} of opioid antagonists to elicit withdrawal jumping in mice following two acute pretreatment doses of the opioid agonist morphine. Antagonists that precipitate vigorous withdrawal jumping across both morphine treatment doses are hypothesized to be strong inverse agonists at the μ-opioid receptor, whereas antagonists that elicit withdrawal jumping in mice treated with the high but not the low dose of morphine are hypothesized to be weak inverse agonists. Male, Swiss-Webster mice (15 – 30 [*]g) were acutely treated with 56 or 180 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 morphine 4 [*]h prior to injection with naloxone, naltrexone, <b>diprenorphine,</b> nalorphine, or naloxonazine. Vertical jumping, paw tremors, and weight loss were recorded. Naloxone, naltrexone, and <b>diprenorphine</b> produced withdrawal jumping after 56 and 180 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 morphine pretreatment. Nalorphine and naloxonazine produced moderate withdrawal jumping after 180 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 morphine pretreatment, but failed to elicit significant withdrawal jumping after 56 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 morphine pretreatment. Nalorphine and naloxonazine blocked the withdrawal jumping produced by naloxone. All antagonists produced paw tremors and weight loss although these effects were generally not dose-dependent. Taken together, these findings reveal a rank order of negative intrinsic efficacy for these opioid antagonists as follows: naloxone=naltrexone⩾diprenorphine>nalorphine=naloxonazine. Furthermore, the observation that nalorphine and naloxonazine blocked the naloxone-induced withdrawal jumping provides additional evidence that nalorphine and naloxonazine are weaker inverse agonists than naloxone...|$|E
40|$|The G-protein coupled {{receptor}} (GPCR) human mu {{opioid receptor}} (hMOR) fused to the carboxy-terminus of the enhanced {{green fluorescent protein}} (EGFP) has been successfully and stably expressed in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells {{under the control of}} an inducible metallothionein promoter. Polyclonal cells expressing EGFPhMOR display high-affinity, saturable, and specific binding sites for the opioid antagonist <b>diprenorphine.</b> Competition studies with opioid agonists and antagonists defined the pharmacological profile of a mu opioid receptor similar to that observed in mammalian cells, suggesting proper folding of EGFPhMOR in a high-affinity state in Drosophila cells. The functionality of the fusion protein was demonstrated by the ability of agonist to reduce forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production and to induce [35 S]GTPgammaS incorporation. The EGFPhMOR protein had the expected molecular weight (70 kDa), as demonstrated by protein immunoblotting with anti-EGFP and anti-C-terminus hMOR antibodies. However, quantitative EGFP fluorescence intensity analysis revealed that the total level of expressed EGFPhMOR is 8 -fold higher than the level of <b>diprenorphine</b> binding sites, indicating that part of the receptor is not in a high-affinity state. This may in part be due to a population of receptors localized in intracellular compartments, as shown by the distribution of fluorescence between the plasma membrane and the cell interior. This study shows that EGFP is a valuable and versatile tool for monitoring and quantifying expression levels as well as for optimizing and characterizing an expression system. Optimization of the Drosophila Schneider 2 cell expression system will allow large-scale purification of GPCRs, thus enabling structural studies to be undertaken...|$|E
40|$|Opioids are {{cationic}} {{compounds that}} mediate their biological action through three highly homologous receptors (jt,, and i) known {{to belong to}} the G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) fam-ily. The third putative transmembrane domain of opioid recep-tors contains a conserved aspartate residue that is typically found in biogenic amine binding GPRs and is generally believed to form an ion pair with the cationic neurotransmitters. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we investigated the possibility of an identical role for this residue (Asp 125) in the mouse 8 -opioid receptor. Removal of the carboxylate group via an aspartate-to-alanine mutation did not modify binding affinity of a repre-sentative set of opioid compounds, including bremazocine, <b>diprenorphine,</b> naloxone, Tyr-D-Thr-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr, [D-Ala 2,D-Leu]enkephaiin, cyclic[Dpenicillamine,Dpenicillaminer]enkephaIin, deltorphin II,...|$|E
40|$|A {{search for}} active {{bacterial}} growth inhibitors among seven highly potent morphine-like narcotics revealed that NIH 7591 and etorphine inhibited {{the rates of}} growth of Escherichia coli by 50 % at 1. 9 × 10 − 4 M. Bacterial cultures escaped from growth inhibition by NIH 7591 after times which were proportional to the drug concentrations and inversely proportional to the initial bacterial densities. Populations of E. coli could adapt to resist and cross-resist growth inhibitions by NIH 7591 and phenazocine. Resistance was lost after growth in drug-free medium for a few doubling times. The agonist-antagonist pair, etorphine and <b>diprenorphine,</b> inhibited growth of E. coli additively without any indication of antagonism. Actions of narcotics in bacteria is considered a theme in its own right...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two {{constructs}} encoding {{the human}} m-opioid receptor (hMOR) fused at its C terminus to {{either one of}} two Ga subunits, Gao 1 (hMOR–Gao 1) and Gai 2 (hMOR– Gai 2), were expressed in Escherichia coli at levels suit-able for pharmacological studies (0. 4 – 0. 5 pmol/mg). Re-ceptors fused to Gao 1 or to Gai 2 maintained high-affinity binding of the antagonist <b>diprenorphine.</b> Affinities of the m-selective agonists morphine, [D-Ala 2,N-Me-Phe 4,Gly 5 -ol]enkephalin (DAMGO), and endomorphins {{as well as their}} potencies and intrinsic activities in stimulating guanosine 59 -O-(3 -[35 S]thiotriphosphate) ([35 S]GTPgS) binding were assessed in the presence of added purified Gbg subunits. Both fusion proteins displayed high-affinity agonist binding and agonist-stimulated [35 S]GTPgS bind-ing. In the presence of Gbg dimers, the affinities o...|$|E
40|$|Opioid {{agonists}} {{caused a}} rapid dose-related {{elevation of the}} cGMP content of N 4 TG 1 murine neuroblastoma cells. An excellent correlation {{was found between the}} rank order of potency of agonists in stimulating cGMP accumulation and in displacing [3 H]etorphine ([3 H]ETP) bound to intact cells. The narcotic antagonists naloxone and <b>diprenorphine</b> failed to increase cGMP content; moreover, in the presence of 5 μM naloxone, the EC 50 of ETP increased from ≈ 9 nM to > 1 μM. N 4 TG 1 cells that had been incubated for 20 min with 0. 32 μM ETP and thoroughly washed displayed a marked loss in sensitivity to subsequent ETP challenge. This desensitization was characterized by a 40 - 50 % decrease in maximal response and an increase in the apparent Ka of ETP from 4 to 50 nM. Desensitization was complete after a 7 -min incubation with 0. 32 μM ETP (t½ ≈ 1 min) and was only slowly reversible (t½ > 60 min). Naloxone (5 μM) and <b>diprenorphine</b> (0. 1 μM) failed to elicit desensitization, but they blocked ETP-induced desensitization. Dextrophan and (+) -ethylketazocine were < 1 % as effective as levorphanol and (-) -ethylketazocine, respectively, in both stimulating cGMP accumulation and inducing desensitization. When the binding of [3 H]ETP (0. 2 - 20 nM) was examined under identical experimental conditions, cells that were completely desensitized by incubation with ETP (7 min with 0. 32 μM or 20 min with 15 nM) showed no loss of high-affinity recognition sites. After longer incubation with ETP (0. 32 μM for 20 - 60 min), the maximal binding of [3 H]ETP was reduced 17 - 41 %. The specific short-term desensitization of cGMP accumulation is not mediated or accompanied by a decrement in the number of agonist binding sites...|$|E
