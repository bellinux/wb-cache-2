2500|$|Young-adult {{readers and}} authors, {{including}} Green himself, {{have been critical}} of the terms. Green has voiced his disagreement with the idea that he is single-handedly responsible for launching or promoting any one individual's career. Green has commented on these arguments: [...] "My concern is that popular work by women receives far more vitriolic criticism from the public (like, in terms of number of demeaning jokes...) than popular work created by men... Also, I would like to see equal attention given to the sexism in popular work by men, from Nicholas Sparks to for instance J. D. Salinger. Catcher in the Rye—although I like it very much—is profoundly and disturbingly misogynistic and yet seems to get a critical pass both online and off. This <b>happens</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> I think, with books by men, and I don't want male writers (including me!) to get that pass." [...] Relating to this issue, Green has stated that he identifies as a feminist.|$|E

In the Patriots' postgame press conference, Wilfork recalled: [...] "I was just fighting pressure with pressure—knowing, seeing the ball went that way. I'm just taught to fight pressure with pressure, so I just started fighting back and knocked him into Sanchez and {{it created a}} fumble." [...] In NBC's television broadcast, immediately following the play, color commentator Cris Collinsworth said that [...] "Vince Wilfork just threw Brandon Moore into Mark Sanchez," [...] a view simultaneously echoed on the Patriots radio call by color analyst Scott Zolak. Moore disagreed with Collinsworth: [...] "when somebody slides {{into the back of}} you, you're going to fall. That <b>happens</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> in general. You don't know what's going on (behind you)." [...] Responding to Moore, Collinsworth qualified his description in a phone interview with ESPN, saying that Wilfork could see the play develop, so [...] "instead of trying to go around Moore, he pushed him back into the play and made the whole thing happen." [...] A New York Daily News columnist sided with Moore, stating that [...] "A second look at the play shows Moore holding his own against Wilfork and moving, if anything, mostly forward." ...|$|E

When issues of power, sexism, role conflict, social rejection and other touchy topics come into play, groups members often find the direct confrontation of such issues to be unsettling. These fantasy chains may begin, but often do not last very long.|$|E
