2500|$|Ice hockey {{requires}} a hard disk of vulcanized rubber. A standard <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> is black, [...] thick, [...] in diameter, and weighs between some pucks are heavier or lighter than standard (see below). Pucks are often marked with silkscreened team or league logos {{on one or}} both faces. Pucks are frozen before the game to reduce bouncing during play.|$|E
2500|$|An {{underwater}} {{hockey puck}} (originally but now rarely {{referred to as}} a [...] "squid" [...] in the United Kingdom), while similar in appearance to an <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>puck,</b> differs in that it has a lead core weighing approximately [...] within a teflon, plastic or rubber coating. This makes the puck dense enough to sink in a swimming pool, though it can be lofted during passes, while affording some protection to the pool tiles.|$|E
2500|$|A further {{development}} is the mask with two windows, one for each eye. It can have the windows closer to the face than the one-window type, and therefore contain even less internal volume for the diver to clear or equalise. These types are often called a [...] "low-volume mask". [...] Participants in the sport of underwater hockey are required to use twin-lens masks of this type for their own safety - the sport uses a heavy lead puck similar to an <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>puck,</b> nan but skilful players can flick the puck considerable height off the bottom when making passes {{which leads to the}} possibility of accidental puck contact with other players. [...] Should a puck hit the lens of a single-lens mask {{there is a good chance}} it will break the glass and pass through the aperture to hit the face and eyes, but with a twin-lens mask though the glass may break the frame will prevent the passage of the puck any further.|$|E
50|$|Roller <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> {{are similar}} to <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks,</b> but made from plastic and thus lighter. They have small ribs {{protruding}} from their tops and bottoms which limit contact with the surface, allowing better sliding motion and less friction.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> of {{regulation}} [...] diameter and [...] thickness {{may be used}} as mechanical vibration dampening isolators in places such as feet for light industrial air compressors, and air conditioning units because they are {{of regulation}} materials and therefore consistent manufacture, size and shape, and are constructed of a repeatable and consistent vulcanized rubber material. [...] Since the material is rubber, it may be drilled out or milled easily to a fixed depth as rubber feet or used as rubber spacer or gasket material. [...] A very common use of a slotted <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> is as an adaptor between the metal foot of a trolley jack and the sill (rocker panel) of an automobile. [...] The sill has a spot-welded lip which fits into the slot of the puck and would otherwise be bent or marked by the metal foot. [...] <b>Hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> have been used to level furniture, beverage refrigeration systems, and as paper weights or door stops. [...] The <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> has many uses other than its original, intended purpose by virtue of its consistent physical properties.|$|R

50|$|Ice hockey {{requires}} a hard disk of vulcanized rubber. A standard <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> is black, 1 in thick, 3 in in diameter, and weighs between 5.5 and 6 oz; some pucks are heavier or lighter than standard (see below). Pucks are often marked with silkscreened team or league logos {{on one or}} both faces. Pucks are frozen before the game to reduce bouncing during play.|$|E
5000|$|An {{underwater}} {{hockey puck}} (originally but now rarely {{referred to as}} a [...] "squid" [...] in the United Kingdom), while similar in appearance to an <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>puck,</b> differs in that it has a lead core weighing approximately 3 lb within a teflon, plastic or rubber coating. This makes the puck dense enough to sink in a swimming pool, though it can be lofted during passes, while affording some protection to the pool tiles.|$|E
2500|$|Vulcanization {{refers to}} a {{specific}} curing process of rubber involving high heat {{and the addition of}} sulfur or other equivalent curatives. It is a chemical process in which polymer molecules are linked to other polymer molecules by atomic bridges composed of sulfur atoms or carbon-to-carbon bonds. A vast array of products are made with vulcanized rubber including <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks,</b> tires, shoe soles, hoses and many more. When [...] "rubber fever" [...] struck Boston in the 1830s, there was a large consumer demand for products made of rubber- aprons, life preservers, hats, carriage tops, and, by 1836, waterproof shoes. But in the heat of summer, rubber goods turned into a gooey, foul-smelling mess; in the winter, they froze stiff. In 1839, Charles Goodyear had a breakthrough when he mixed liquid latex with sulfur and heating it in the sun or over a stove top. The leather-like form of the stretchable substance resulted in the first vulcanized rubber. Goodyear received a patent on June 15, 1844.|$|R

During {{his years in}} Sweden, he {{developed}} into the league's finest goaltender, winning the Honken Trophy three consecutive seasons; 2003, 2004, and 2005. In 2005, he also won {{two of the most}} prestigious awards in Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>hockey,</b> the Golden <b>Puck</b> and the Golden Helmet.|$|R
5000|$|In the National Basketball Association, Manu Ginóbili and Jamaal Tinsley {{employ the}} pass between the legs variant. Some {{commentators}} {{also use the}} [...] "5-hole" [...] term whenever this happens. The term, [...] "5-hole," [...] is used in <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> when the <b>puck</b> goes between the goalie's legs into the goal. [...] Other sports such as soccer have adopted hockey's usage, at least in America.|$|R
50|$|The puck is {{approximately}} {{the size of}} an <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> but is made of lead or similar material (Adult size weighs 1.3 - 1.5 kg, Junior 800 - 850 g) and is encapsulated or surrounded by a plastic covering which is usually matched to the pool bottom to facilitate good grip on the stick face while preventing excessive friction on the pool bottom. The puck's weight brings it to rest on the pool bottom, though it can be lofted during passes.|$|E
50|$|There were no blue lines {{therefore}} no icing; however, {{there was}} still illegal clearing (icing) and a different version of offside—a player could skate over the red line before the puck; however, the player couldn't receive a pass over the line. The puck itself was lighter, at 3 oz. and made of red plastic {{as opposed to a}} 5 oz. black rubber <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>puck.</b> There were four 12-minute quarters opposed to the NHL's three 20-minute periods. A tied score at the end of regulation time in the regular season would go straight to a shootout instead of overtime.|$|E
5000|$|Fox's NHL {{broadcasts}} {{are perhaps}} best remembered {{for its use}} of FoxTrax (colloquially called the [...] "glow puck," [...] "smart puck" [...] or [...] "super puck"), a specialized <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> designed for the network's NHL telecasts, which featured internal electronics that allow its position to be tracked. It was primarily used to visually highlight the puck on-screen and display a trail when the puck was moving rapidly. The FoxTrax puck, while considered to be generally popular according to Fox Sports, generated {{a great deal of}} controversy and criticism, especially in Canada, from longtime fans of the game, and was ridiculed by comedians {{on both sides of the}} border.|$|E
40|$|Title: Development of game {{combinations}} in <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> {{for older}} pupils Objectives: The main {{aim of this}} bachelor thesis is to gather informations {{about the development of}} game combinations and then create an excercise summary which is specific for offensive game combinations in different areas of the field. It will be a combination of "pass and go". Methods: The first phase of this bachelor thesis will be only theoretical. I will research information from expert literature, which relate to the topic of this bachelor thesis. In the beginning I will focus on sports games, then on <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> and then on the game combinations. In another part I will focus on the practical part, in which I will create the excercise and then I will describe these excercise. Key words: Sports games, <b>ice</b> <b>hockey,</b> player, <b>puck,</b> exercises, cooperation, pass, training session...|$|R
50|$|In <b>ice</b> <b>hockey,</b> if the <b>puck</b> gets {{knocked out}} of play (such as into the player's benches, over the glass, or into the netting), a {{face-off}} shall be conducted at the nearest face-off dot to where the puck {{had gone out of}} play. However, if the puck is directly shot out of bounds over the glass deliberately by a player such as a goaltender or any defensive player within their own defensive zone, a delay of game minor penalty shall be assessed on the offending player.|$|R

The venues were located 300 m apart.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>hockey</b> is a {{full contact}} sport and carries {{a high risk of}} injury. Players are moving at speeds around {{approximately}} [...] and quite a bit of the game revolves around the physical contact between the players. Skate blades, hockey sticks, shoulders, hips, and <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> all contribute. The types of injuries associated with hockey include: lacerations, concussions, contusions, ligament tears, broken bones, hyperextensions, and muscle strains. Women's <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> players can have contact but are not allowed to body check.|$|R
50|$|Microcrystalline wax is used {{in sports}} too, {{specifically}} in <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> and snowboarding. It {{is applied to the}} friction tape of an <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> stick to prevent degradation of the tape due to water destroying the glue on the tape and also to increase control of the <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> due to the waxes' adhesive quality. It is also applied to the underside of snowboards to reduce friction and increase the gliding ability of the board, making it easier to control and diminishing the fatigue of the rider.|$|R
50|$|Ball {{hockey is}} {{patterned}} after and {{closely related to}} <b>ice</b> <b>hockey,</b> except {{the game is played}} on foot on a non-ice surface, player equipment is different, and a ball is used instead of a <b>hockey</b> <b>puck.</b> The object of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by shooting the ball into the opposing team's net.|$|R
40|$|Laminated {{tempered}} glass sheets were tested under impact loading to simulate conditions in <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> arenas, where <b>pucks</b> hit the glass shields at high velocities. Thirty-six tests {{have been conducted}} on 1220 x 460 mm sheets of glass, 9. 5, 12. 7 and 15. 9 mm thick, using falling weights attached to an actual puck. Twenty-four of the specimens were laminated on one side using 0. 36 mm thick polyester transparent laminates. The weights and drop heights were increased gradually until failure occurred. The kinetic energy, equivalent puck field velocities, equivalent static failure loads and stresses have been estimated. The estimated field velocities of the pucks at failure were all higher than the maximum recorded in the game. The study showed that lamination has significantly changed failure mode of glass from a catastrophic failure, where fragments shatter, potentially causing serious injuries, to one which is still brittle yet substantially safer as fractured glass remains fully intact. No rupture or delamination of the laminates was observed...|$|R
5000|$|Spongee is a {{cross between}} <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> and {{broomball}} and is most popular in Manitoba, Canada.

The death of Brittanie Cecil from injuries sustained from a <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> flying into the stands at a Blue Jackets game on March 16, 2002 led to the installation of nylon netting to catch pucks that fly over the acrylic glass at all professional <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> arenas in the NHL, AHL, and ECHL.|$|R
2500|$|The RPI Engineers are the {{athletic}} teams for the university. RPI currently sponsors 23sports, 21 of which {{compete at the}} NCAA Division III level in the Liberty League; men's and women's <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> compete at the Division I level in ECAC Hockey. The official nickname {{of some of the}} school's Division III teams was changed in 1995 from the Engineers to the Red Hawks. However, the hockey, football, cross-country, tennis and track and field teams all chose to retain the Engineers name. The Red Hawks name was, at the time, very unpopular among the student body; a Red Hawk mascot was frequently taunted with thrown concessions and chants of [...] "kill the chicken!". In 2009 the nickname for all teams has since been changed back to Engineers. In contrast, the official <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> mascot, known as Puckman, has always been very popular. Puckman is an anthropomorphic <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> with an engineer's helmet.|$|R
