Results indicate that with present-day knowledge of chemical fuels, neither very high nor very low fuel densities have any advantages for long-range flight.

Those residues are mainly composed of a mixture of hydrocarbons, water and inert solids. Therefore, their final disposal represents a significant environmental problem.

The findings {{of this study suggest that}} protozoal colonization of the SBBR followed the same pattern of activated sludge systems, the free swimming and crawling ciliates, and also fagellates being the dominant protozoa group during the star-up period of the reactor. When the plant performance dropped, the number of flagellated protozoa rapidly increased, and a concomitant decrease in the ciliated population was observed.

40|$|Effective {{removal of}} black powder from a gas {{transmission}} system often requires {{a combination of}} methods. Removing such particulates is a multistep process requiring a comprehensive {{understanding of the nature}} of the problem. Different tools may be effective in some instances but not in others. This article examines Greek Public Gas Corp. SA’s (DEPA’s) experience in fighting black powder in its system, focused on its determining which technique provided the most efficient and cost-effective method of powder removal. Included in this examination are the different sorts of pigs, filters, and separators DEPA used in attempting to address the problem, with the effectiveness and shortcomings of each assessed. Background Black powder is a solid contaminant found in natural gas transmission and distribution systems throughout the world. Chemical or biological reactions with steel found in natural gas pipelines, gas wells, and associated facilities can create black powder. 1 Solids may be simple or complex mixtures of small particles dispersed in gas (particulates) or they may be dispersed in water or liquid <b>hydrocarbons</b> (<b>slurry)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In {{preparation}} of gelant solution for making crosslinked polymer gels for water shutoff applications unpublished experiments plus chemical intuition suggest that, unless hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) polymer is fully hydrated before addition of crosslinker, the final gel will have lower than optimum mechanical strength. It is suggested so because polymer chains {{need to be}} unfolded before proper crosslinking can occur. We have evaluated gel strengths of ?flowing? gels for water shut off in natural fractures and other non-matrix features {{as a function of}} time of addition of crosslinker relative to time of hydration of polymer. Gels were prepared from moderately high molecular weight HPAM crosslinked with chromium(III) acetate (CrAc) or polyethyleneimine (PEI). Crosslinker was added after either (1) initial wetting of solid polymer particles or (2) complete hydration of polymer. HPAM can be purchased as a fine particulate <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>slurry</b> or as a solution concentrate, either of which, when diluted into makeup water, rapidly provides fully hydrated polymer solution. However, dry HPAM is often preferred because of lower overall cost of active material and smaller storage footprint than slurry or liquid concentrates. The down side of using the solid product is that it generally requires two or more large blending tanks in order to fully hydrate polymer for large volume gel treatments. However, if conditions exist where crosslinker can be added to wetted but not fully hydrated polymer, then dry polymer and crosslinker can be blended in a small continuous flow unit, with full hydration occurring downhole prior to gelation. Gel strengths were determined using a common qualitative coding system for gels prepared in identical manner except for timing of crosslinker addition. Crosslinker was added immediately after wetting of polymer or after polymer had been agitated until complete hydration. Samples were prepared in fresh water or 4 % NaCl brine and at ambient temperature or 122 ?F. For almost all samples of polymer gels prepared with identical concentrations of HPAM and CrAc, there was no observable difference in gel strength regardless of time of addition of crosslinker. HPAM/CrAc polymer gels with 4 wt% NaCl make up water were lower in strength by one code level with respect to those prepared with fresh water. For polymer gels hydrated at 122 ?F with 4 wt% NaCl there was no gel strength code level difference with respect to those prepared at ambient temperature with 4 wt% NaCl. For HPAM/PEI polymer gels the majority of the samples showed similar gel strengths regardless of the timing of crosslinker addition. A few polymer gels showed weaker gel strengths when prepared from partially hydrated polymer solution before crosslinker addition. Presence of 4 wt% NaCl in the makeup water gave weaker gel strengths than those prepared with fresh water with an average difference of four code levels. The pre-gel viscosity of a polymer solution was also compared to the timing of crosslinker addition at ambient temperature. For HPAM/PEI system the overall polymer solution viscosity decreased when PEI was added whereas for HPAM/CrAc system the polymer solution viscosity remained similar after crosslinker was added to the completely hydrated polymer solution but increased when crosslinker was added to partially hydrated polymer solution. The most significant result of this work is the demonstration that for most field applications optimum quality gel can be obtained using dry polymer and a small continuous mixing system for initial wetting of the polymer after which the crosslinker can be added to the polymer solution on the fly. This practice can decrease the footprint, equipment requirements and labor and thus the cost of large volume flowing gel treatments...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of screen-bowl centrifuges in today's fine coal cleaning circuits, a significant amount of low-ash, high-Btu coal can be lost during the dewatering step due to the difficulty in capturing coal of this size consist (< 100 mesh or 0. 15 mm). The GranuFlow{trademark} technology, developed and patented by an in-house research group at DOE-NETL, involves the addition of an emulsified mixture of high-molecular-weight <b>hydrocarbons</b> to a <b>slurry</b> of finesized coal before cleaning and/or mechanical dewatering. The binder selectively agglomerates the coal, but not the clays or other mineral matter. In practice, the binder is applied so as to contact the finest possible size fraction first (for example, froth flotation product) as agglomeration of this fraction produces the best result for a given concentration of binder. Increasing the size consist of the fine-sized coal stream reduces the loss of coal solids to the waste effluent streams from the screen bowl centrifuge circuit. In addition, the agglomerated coal dewaters better and is less dusty. The binder can also serve as a flotation conditioner and may provide freeze protection. The overall objective of the project is to generate all necessary information and data required to commercialize the GranuFlow{trademark} Technology. The technology was evaluated under full-scale operating conditions at three commercial coal preparation plants to determine operating performance and economics. The handling, storage, and combustion properties of the coal produced by this process were compared to untreated coal during a power plant combustion test...|$|R
