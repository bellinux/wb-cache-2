5|$|Nansouty's cavalry {{took part}} in several actions, {{beginning}} with the Battle of Engen, where the commander was noted for his able and daring manoeuvres, subsequently leading a successful charge against enemy infantry, whom he chased {{through the streets of}} the nearby city of Stockach, the locale of the French Army of the Danube's defeat a year earlier. He patrolled the Tyrol and there repulsed Prince Reuss-Plauen's forces in an action fought on 14 June 1800, the day when First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte was winning at Marengo further to the south. Nansouty served as a commander of an autonomous unit in the Tyrol {{until the end of the}} War of the Second Coalition, then under the successive command of Generals Molitor and Gudin. Nansouty's command included as many as five regiments, after the 6th and 8th Hussars were attached to his force. During this time, he enhanced his solid reputation as an able and adept cavalry commander; General Lecourbe stated that he wanted nobody <b>else</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> helm of his cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Neelambari plans her {{revenge on}} Padayappa, now {{a father of}} two daughters. Suryaprakash also has a son, Chandraprakash alias Chandru, who studies at the same college as Padayappa's elder daughter, Anitha. Neelambari advises Chandru to make Anitha {{fall in love with}} him. At the same time, Padayappa plans to get Anitha married to his sister's son. Neelambari, having made Chandru pretend {{to fall in love with}} Anitha, plans to humiliate Padayappa by making Anitha say that she does not wish to marry a groom of her parents' choice and that she is in love with someone <b>else.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> {{marriage}} ceremony, after Anitha does what Neelambari told her to do, Padayappa makes an oath to unite Anitha with her lover by the next Muhurta day, or commit suicide. Padayappa discovers that Chandru really did fall in love with Anitha even though he was only initially pretending to do so on Neelambari's advise. When Padayappa takes Chandru and Anitha to the temple to get married, Neelambari and Suryaprakash give chase to stop them. Suryaprakash is killed in a car accident during the chase.|$|E
25|$|Many of the viewers, already deeply {{upset at}} the murder of such a brave, honest, courageous, and well-loved man {{apparently}} killed in defence of his family, were further affected by the mournful manner in which Dyer, who deeply respected and admired Swift, spoke. It was only later revealed {{that the reason for}} Dyer's initial refusal to speak on air, and his actual refusal to look into the camera whilst speaking – having been forced against his will, by Casey, to deliver the eulogy – was solely due to his having left his false teeth at home (a fact that he refused to reveal to Casey or anyone <b>else</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time), and {{had nothing to do with}} any reluctance to acknowledge his own personal sense of great loss at Swift's murder.|$|E
25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held on Thursday morning, lasted 45 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning.

His closest challenger was Félix da Costa in second in front of third-placed Coletti and Mücke Motorsport's Felix Rosenqvist in fourth position. Alexander Sims was fifth-fastest, ahead of Jaafar. Tom Blomqvist, Marciello, Lucas Auer and Korjus rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Sainz {{was the first of}} the drivers to go off the track in wet conditions and rebounded off the Fisherman's Corner barriers with his car's rear-end. His teammate King understeered into the same barrier eleven minutes later, while Rosenqvist crashed at San Francisco Bend on dirty tyres due to him running wide at Lisboa turn. Three other drivers—Sekiguchi, Lucas Wolf and Sun Zheng—failed to record a lap time as a consequence of encountering incidents during the session.|$|E

25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held on Thursday morning, lasted 45 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Lucas Auer set the fastest time for Theodore Racing by Prema in the opening practice session—which was delayed for one hour to facilitate barrier repairs at Police corner following a support race crash —with a lap of two minutes and 14.645 seconds. 0.055 seconds faster than any one <b>else</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> track. His closest challenger was Antonio Giovinazzi ahead of teammate Tom Blomqvist and Buller. Jordan King was fifth-fastest, in front of Felix Rosenqvist. Max Verstappen, Nicholas Latifi, Coletti and Sean Gelael rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Gelael and Cao made contact at Lisboa corner and Sam MacLeod crashed into the barriers at Police corner. Wells spun into the wall at Fisherman's bend with Mitsunori Takaboshi caused the session to be stopped by hitting the Moorish Hill turn barrier. Ocon was caught off guard by the accident and damaged his left-front suspension by swiping Takaboshi's car. Spike Goddard impacted the Moorish Hill corner wall in the session's closing minutes which prevented anyone from improving on their quickest lap times.|$|E

[...] And as Julie and Billy ride together on the swirling carousel, and the stage picture surges with the excitement of the crowd, and the orchestra storms to a climax, and the curtain falls, we realize that R & H have not only skipped the overture and the opening number but the exposition as well. [...] They have plunged into the story, right into the middle of it, in the most intense first scene any musical ever had.|$|E
500|$|The writer Michael Steinberg {{described}} the symphony's success as essentially {{a phenomenon of}} the compact disc, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in A guide to the symphony, wondered whether the commercial success of the work was [...] "a flash in the pan" [...] or {{would turn out to}} have lasting significance. In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, [...] " [...] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?" [...] Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the Doctor Zhivago phenomenon of 1958: [...] "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity." [...] Górecki was as surprised as anyone <b>else</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> recording's success, and later speculated that [...] "perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. Somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I Luv This Shit" [...] {{was written}} by August Alsina, The Exclusives (Sean McMillion and Ralph Jeanty), Samuel Irving III, Christine Massa, and Trinidad James and was {{produced}} by Knucklehead. It was recorded by McMillion and Cody Sciara at Goldie's Playhouse and Zac Recording Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance from Trehy Harris at Larrabee Sound Studios, North Hollywood. Vocals were produced by The Exclusives. Knucklehead told Vibe in 2014 that he created the song's beat and {{knew it would be}} successful, stating: [...] "I just knew what [...] voice was gonna do over my beat. And that beat didn't sound like thing <b>else</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time that was out ... When I made the beat, I called him immediately after I finished it." [...] After playing the beat to Alsina and The Exclusives, they recorded the song in one hour. It is an R song instrumented by guitar, synthesizer, synth-horns and a heavy bassline. The production was compared by Spin Brandon Soderberg to the work of The-Dream. It revolves around about partying with alcohol and drugs with the central hook [...] "I love this shit", and references the vodka Ciroc, yet {{there is an element of}} sorrow to Alsina's vocals. James' verse contemplates human nature, according to Gregory Adams of Exclaim!. [...] "I Luv This Shit" [...] was originally recorded for Alsina's mixtape The Product 2 (2013), and was included on his debut EP [...] (2013). It was also a bonus track on his first studio album, Testimony (2014).|$|E

Claire Suddath of Time magazine commented that [...] "this offering from the reigning queen of pop music is relatively toned down and yet she still looked and sounded better than nearly everyone <b>else</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> awards." [...] Similarly, Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "If you had to pick one defining moment, {{it would have to}} be Beyoncé’s baby bump.

[...] A critic of Essence magazine concluded that [...] " [...] performance of 'Love on Top' at the 2011 VMAs [...] will surely be one of the year's most memorable pop culture moments." [...] The writers of MTV News placed the performance at number 4 on their list of Best Live MTV Performances of 2011.

Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine put the performance at number two on her list of [...] "Beyonce's 5 Biggest TV Performances" [...] adding that it was [...] "one of the most memorable TV moments of her career".
