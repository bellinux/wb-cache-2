40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{is one of}} the industrial sectors with high rates of workplace accidents. With respect to numbers of workplace accidents occurred is attributed frequently to the human error factor. To analyze workplace accidents occurred in <b>building</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> that is caused byhuman error, therefore an approach is needed. The purpose of this research is to identify the factors that cause the human error risk which can lead to workplace accident in <b>building</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> in DKI Jakarta. This study utilizes system approach principle. The mechanism describes relations among worker and organizational, managerial, as well as environment that explained the occurrence workplace accidents, directly or indirectly. This research is divided into two phases; the first phase identifies the frequent risk occurred in <b>building</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work,</b> whereas, the second phase identifies the cause of the occurrence risk. This research concluded that organizational and managerial factors are also considered to creating “hole” in the workplace safety defense system. Therefore, an ideal system that involved all related parties is essential to prevent the workplace accidents...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project is to review the ICTAD conditions of contract suitable for local <b>building</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works.</b> The Government of Sri Lanka had approved the said document in August 1988 {{to use in the}} state sector for both building and civil engineering <b>construction</b> <b>works,</b> which was prepared by the ICTAD, commonly known as the 'ICTAD conditions of contract'. Since the building and civil engineering <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> have some differences in their character and contract administration, which are described in chapter 4, the use of one document is not a desirable approach given the diversity of practices and traditions prevailing in both works. The ICTAD conditions of contract is a document far from perfect {{and there are plenty of}} scope for improvements, because this was prepared based on the FIDIC conditions of contract (Third edition) which is 17 years old document. Use of a single document to cover the both <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> is not practice in the international construction scene. By considering all the above action was taken to review the ICT AD conditions of contract mainly through literature survey, questionnaire survey and the comparison of selected conditions of contracts.

40|$|Worker {{mistakes}} are {{shown to be}} a routine and inevitable part of <b>building</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work.</b> <b>Buildings</b> emerge out of a context of accumulated mistakes which take on an irreversible continuity in the process. Consumers (and taxpapers) unknowingly accept these products that may be permeated with many hidden, unanticipated future problems. Four varieties of {{mistakes are}} delineated as are the various management techniques employed by workers for dealing with these errors. This unintended, yet consequential, error stems from three inter-related phenomena: the transitional nature of the work setting; the specialized nature of the work performed including the diverse multi-skilled specialists who do that work; and the "ne-gotiated " process by which the work gets done. Much of the damage and added cost created by these mistakes is predictable and manage-able. Yet, unions, business, and government make little effort to limit these costs to the consumer (and taxpayer). This paper 1 will portray^the variety of mistakes that occur during a <b>building</b> <b>construction</b> sequence 2 and the techniques employed by skilled tradesmen in the management of these mistakes.

40|$|Unlike other {{economic}} sectors, {{the construction industry}} is characterized by which are discontinues, dispersed, diverse and distinct. Therefore, improvement of quality in <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> is comparably difficult as in other industries such as manufacturing, agriculture etc. The previous studies show various factors, which affect the achievement of construction quality. These factors significantly contribute to increase the failure cost. Studies on 'cost of quality' revealed that by spending a little on prevention costs such as practicing ISO 9000 quality systems would save {{a higher percentage of}} the failure costs. It is obvious that as ISO 9000 quality system provide generic core values for quality improvements, {{it would be possible to}} grasp guidelines from ISO 9000 quality system, to minimize the effect of the factors affecting construction quality. The study presented in this report identifies the factors affecting the construction quality, and the impact of contract document on quality management aspects in the <b>Building</b> <b>Construction</b> Industry of Sri Lanka, based on the ISO 9000 quality standard requirements. The objectives of this research were 1) to investigate the significant factors affecting construction quality in Sri Lanka, 2) to investigate the adequacy of ICTAD Specifications used in <b>Building</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>works</b> to assure the Quality of the works, 3) to investigate the extent of Quality Management aspects covered in ICTAD Conditions of Contract, 4) to identify necessary changes for improving Contract Documents to assure Quality of <b>Building</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>works.</b> The study revealed that, According to the local contractors, there are six factors that significantly affect construction quality; three of them are market related and the rest are related to the culture, management and quality system of the organization.

This study also investigated the differences between the students’ type of learning styles and their ability to solve the problem using their creative thinking. A survey was carried out on 68 vocational students in <b>Building</b> <b>Construction</b> Course from two Vocational Schools. Felder-Soloman’s Index of Learning Styles (ILS) and elements of creative thinking in problem solving for Vocational Education were the tools used in this study. Creative thinking in problem solving elements was categorized from the subject specification used in <b>Building</b> <b>Construction</b> curriculum. In brief, the ILS have five dimension; Processing, Perception, Input, Understanding and Perception. The results show that the Input style dominates the learning styles of Building Construction’s students in Vocational School and manipulating idea is the dominant creative thinking elements to solve the problem which students preferred. In conclusion, type of students’ learning styles will influence how they can cater their learning to improve their academic achievement and how they can use their creativity to solve the problem in actual situation in <b>Building</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>work.</b> However, learning styles are not main indicator to predict how students excellent are. </p...|$|R
