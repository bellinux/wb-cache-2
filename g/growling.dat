5|$|Moaning or yowling: This is an {{escalated}} {{version of}} <b>growling</b> {{and is often}} combined with it. It is typically displayed when the danger increases. A study found that yowls could {{last as long as}} two seconds.|$|E
5|$|Several {{calls of}} red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} have been recorded. The bird's contact call is a rolling metallic krur-rr or kree, which may carry long distances and is always given while flying; its alarm call is sharp. Displaying males vocalize {{a sequence of}} soft <b>growling</b> followed by a repetitive kred-kred-kred-kred.|$|E
5|$|Townsend {{employs a}} variety of vocal {{techniques}} in his work, including screaming, <b>growling</b> or even falsetto. His vocal range has been noted to be over 5 octaves (C2 to F7), noting that he mainly masters 2nd and 5th octaves for clean but also raucous vocals & 5th to 7th octaves for purely screamed vocals.|$|E

Adobe {{has published a}} blog post apologizing for installing <b>Growl</b> on users' systems without permission, and says that they are [...] "actively working to mitigate the problem". Adobe has an article in their knowledge base explaining what notifications CS5 sends and how to remove <b>Growl.</b>|$|R
60|$|The bear uttered <b>growl</b> after <b>growl,</b> {{showing that}} he was working himself up to a perfect fury.|$|R
5|$|The female is mildly {{aggressive}} to her suitors during estrus, {{and will}} often lunge at males, usually {{after a long}} period of being approached and followed. Vocalizations during mating include a whistling sound, most commonly by the female, usually during June and August, coinciding with female estrus. Other vocalizations recorded during estrus include chittering and <b>growling.</b> The testosterone levels of the males are seasonal, with peaks coinciding with female estrogen peaks.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, <b>growling,</b> and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} of loud, {{aggressive}} rock music. The {{electric guitar}} is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often <b>growling,</b> raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E
40|$|Among the {{so-called}} extended vocal techniques, vocal <b>growl</b> {{is a rather}} common effect in some ethnic (e. g. the Xhosa people in South Africa) and pop styles (e. g. Jazz, Louis Armstrong-type) of music. <b>Growl</b> usually consists of simultaneous vibrations of the vocal folds and supra-glottal structures of the larynx, either in harmonic or sub-harmonic co-oscillation. This paper examines <b>growl</b> mechanism using vide-ofluoroscopy and high-speed imaging, and its acousit-cal characteristics by spectral analysis and model simu-lation. In <b>growl,</b> the larynx position is usually high and aryepiglottic folds vibrate. The aryepiglottic constriction is associated to a unique shape of the vocal tract, includ-ing the larynx tube, and characterizes <b>growl.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|Other vocalisations {{of wolves}} are usually {{divided into three}} categories: growls, barks and whines. Barking has a {{fundamental}} frequency between 320–904Hz, and is usually emitted by startled wolves. Wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as dogs do, but bark {{a few times and}} retreat from perceived danger. <b>Growling</b> has a fundamental frequency of 380–450Hz, and is usually emitted during food challenges. Pups commonly growl when playing. One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched whine, which precedes a lunging attack. Whining is associated with situations of anxiety, curiosity, inquiry and intimacy such as greeting, feeding pups and playing.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog was first {{described}} as Rana aurea by Lesson in 1827. It has changed classification 20 times; {{it was first}} named Litoria aurea in 1844 by Günther, and changed another 9 times before being named again as Litoria aurea. The specific epithet aurea derived from the Latin aureus for 'golden'. The species is now classified within the Litoria aurea complex, a closely related group of frogs in the Litoria genus. This complex is scattered throughout Australia: three species occur in south-east Australia, one in northern Australia, and two in Southwest Australia. The complex consists of the green and golden bell frog (L. aurea), <b>growling</b> grass frog (L. raniformis), yellow-spotted bell frog (L. castanea), Dahl's aquatic frog (L. dahlii), spotted-thighed frog (L. cyclorhyncha) and the motorbike frog (L. moorei). The ranges of L. raniformis and L. castanea overlap with the green and golden bell frog; this, {{as well as physical}} similarities, may make it difficult to distinguish between the species, and until 1972, L. raniformis and the green and golden bell frog were regarded as the same, when electrophoretic studies proved them to be distinct. The tablelands bell frog has not been seen since 1980 and may now be extinct, although the large yellow spots present on its thighs help distinguish it from the green and golden bell frog. The <b>growling</b> grass frog, which is very similar to the green and golden bell frog, can only be readily distinguished by raised bumps on the dorsal surface. It has also been proposed that some populations of L. aurea located near Ulong, New South Wales, be a separate subspecies, L. a. ulongae, but this was not accepted.|$|E
5|$|The vocalisations of {{cockatoos}} are {{loud and}} harsh. They serve {{a number of}} functions, including allowing individuals to recognize one another, alerting others of predators, indicating individual moods, maintaining the cohesion of a flock and as warnings when defending nests. The use of calls and number of specific calls varies by species; the Carnaby's black cockatoo has as many as 15 different calls, whereas others, such as Major Mitchell's cockatoo, have fewer. Some, like the gang-gang cockatoo, are comparatively quiet but do have softer <b>growling</b> calls when feeding. In addition to vocalisations, palm cockatoos communicate over large distances by drumming on a dead branch with a stick. Cockatoo species also make a characteristic hissing sound when threatened.|$|E
50|$|<b>Growl</b> is {{a global}} {{notification}} system and pop-up notification implementation for the Mac OS X and Windows operating systems. Applications can use <b>Growl</b> to display small notifications about events which may be important to the user. This software allows users to fully control their notifications, while allowing application developers to spend less time creating notifications and <b>Growl</b> developers {{to concentrate on the}} usability of notifications. <b>Growl</b> can be used in conjunction with Apple's Notification Center that is included in recent versions of OS X (Mountain Lion 10.8 and higher).|$|R
5000|$|A death <b>growl</b> (or {{simply a}} <b>growl)</b> is a vocal style (an {{extended}} vocal technique) usually employed by singers from death metal music genres, but {{also used in}} a variety of other heavy metal styles, such as metalcore. Death <b>growls</b> are sometimes criticized for their [...] "ugliness". However, the harshness of death <b>growls</b> is in keeping with death metal's abrasive music style and often dark and obscene subject matter. The progressively more forceful enunciation of metal vocals has been noted from heavy metal to thrash metal to death metal.|$|R
60|$|Further, Jerry's own {{hearing was}} trained to still greater acuteness. Hours at a time, sitting by Nalasu or {{standing}} apart from him, he was taught to catch the slightest sounds or rustlings from the bush. Still further, he was taught to differentiate between the bush noises and between the ways he <b>growled</b> warnings to Nalasu. If a rustle took place that Jerry identified as a pig or a chicken, he did not <b>growl</b> at all. If he did not identify the noise, he <b>growled</b> fairly softly. But if the noise were made by a man or boy who moved softly and therefore suspiciously, Jerry learned to <b>growl</b> loudly; if the noise were loud and careless, then Jerry's <b>growl</b> was soft.|$|R
5|$|Although wildcats are solitary, {{the social}} {{behavior}} of domestic cats {{is much more}} variable and ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that form around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females. Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others. Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories. These territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation. Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and <b>growling,</b> and if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks. Despite some cats cohabiting in colonies, {{they do not have}} a social survival strategy, or a pack mentality, and always hunt alone.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) {{leaves his}} trailer for work, as he {{approaches}} a bear <b>growling</b> outside. He wants {{to move back to}} Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s house, but Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) insists that they must go forward in life. Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) brings her father, Thatcher Grey (Jeff Perry), who is vomiting blood, into the emergency room, and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) treats him. Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) admits an elderly patient, Irving Waller (Ralph Waite), with skin growths, who later reveals that he wants a penile prosthesis, to which he receives. It is revealed that Thatcher needs a liver transplantation, and Stevens is assigned to a cancerous patient, Randy (Jocko Sims), by Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) wants to ask the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) for a job as an attending surgeon, but is nervous that he will reject her, and goes out to lunch with her girlfriend Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw).|$|E
5|$|Since European {{settlement}} {{the area}} has been subdivided, settled and farmed. A traveller in 1855 noted that the area was highly cultivated. The endangered <b>Growling</b> Grass Frog (Litoria raniformis) has been sighted, though {{there is only a}} single record. In some undisturbed areas there is Poa labillardierei (silver tussock) grassland and Themeda triandra (kangaroo grass). Glycine latrobeana (clover glycine) was recorded south of the town in 1984. Discaria pubescens (Hairy Anchor Plant or Australian Anchor Plant), which appears on the states endangered species list, was recorded north-east in 2001 on the South Esk River's floodplain. Apart from introduced brown trout the Liffey River is home to platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). Platypus in the river have, in common with in other rivers nearby, been found with the potentially lethal fungal infection Mucor amphiborum.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} season {{varies according to}} latitude, taking place from April to July in Queensland, January to May in northern New South Wales, December to February in southern New South Wales, and October to February in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The male yellow-tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up crest and spreading his tail feathers to display his yellow plumage. Softly <b>growling,</b> he approaches the female and bows {{three or four times}} to her. His eye ring may also flush a deeper pink. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees, generally eucalypts, which are either living or dead. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. A 1994 study of nesting sites in Eucalyptus regnans forest in the Strzelecki Ranges in eastern Victoria found the average age of trees used for hollows by the yellow-tailed black cockatoo to be 228 years. The authors noted that the proposed 80–150 year rotation time for managed forests would impact on the numbers of suitable trees.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Sellers {{appeared in a}} further three television series based on The Goons, which aired on Britain's new ITV channel. The series were The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d, A Show Called Fred and Son of Fred. In 1957 film producer Michael Relph became impressed with Sellers's portrayal of an elderly character in Idiot Weekly, and cast the 32-year-old actor as a 68-year-old projectionist in Basil Dearden's The Smallest Show on Earth, supporting Bill Travers, Virginia McKenna and Margaret Rutherford. The film was a commercial success and is now {{thought of as a}} minor classic of British screen comedy in the post-war era. Following this, Sellers provided the <b>growling</b> voice of Winston Churchill to the BAFTA award winning film The Man Who Never Was. Later in 1957 Sellers portrayed a television star with a talent for disguises in Mario Zampi's offbeat black comedy The Naked Truth, opposite Terry-Thomas, Peggy Mount, Shirley Eaton and Dennis Price.|$|E
