40|$|A simple {{design of}} a {{wideband}} antenna with the capability of switching its operation among five polarization states is proposed. The primary radiator consists of two bowtie dipoles arranged orthogonally through double printed rings. The polarization-reconfigurability is realized by electronically switching three p-i-n-diode pairs. By controlling the current paths from the feeding coaxial line to each <b>dipole</b> <b>arm</b> and among these arms, the antenna can change its radiation among circular polarization (CP) with both rotating senses and linear polarization at three different angles, namely, 0 °, 90 °, and 45 °. The fabricated prototype exhibits an impedance bandwidth (BW) of 37. 1 % from 2. 2 to 3. 2 GHz for all polarization states. The axial ratio BW for both CP states is 50. 4 %, covering the above frequency range. A measured realized gain of greater than 6. 6 dBi and a radiation efficiency of around 80 % over the overlapped BW are achieved for all states...|$|E

40|$|Physical {{limitations}} {{based only}} on antenna volume, form factor and material parameters are applied to electrically small antennas {{in the form of}} single dipoles. The upper bound on the gain-bandwidth product is solely determined by the polarisability matrix that characterises the antenna when it is immersed in a uniform applied static field. The polarisability, and hence the bandwidth, is increased by loading the <b>dipole</b> <b>arms</b> close to their ends. The half-power impedance bandwidth is increased from 5 to 13 % by moving the coils from the centre {{to the ends of the}} <b>dipole</b> <b>arms.</b> The introduction of a stub-matching further improves the bandwidth but the physical limit is not reached. Finally, a dual-resonance dipole antenna is analysed.

In this antenna design, Agilent's Advanced Design System (ADS) software using momentum simulation is employed to analyze the entire structure. Different width (W = 3, 5, 7, 9 mm) of the arm of dipole antenna is analyzed to study {{on the performance of}} frequency resonance.

40|$|Low-cost, compact, {{circular}} planar dipole UWB antennas {{have been}} designed, {{based on the}} ‘two-penny dipole’. One of the dipole arms has been integrated with the ground plane of a microstrip transmission line, the strip being connected to the other <b>dipole</b> <b>arm.</b> The use of microstrip in stead of stripline technology hardly degrades the radiation characteristics, but simplifies the antenna architecture considerably. Up to 6 GHz the azimuthal gain variation does not exceed 3 dB. For frequencies in excess of 6 GHz the antenna becomes too long, resulting in the forming of elevational lobes and large azimuthal gain variations. Shortening the antenna, results in gain-uniformity in azimuth for high frequencies {{at the cost of}} a resonance shift beyond 3 GHz. As shown by the first full-wave simulations, this shortening may be realised without compromising the in-band return loss specifications. First measurements performed with antennas realised on FR 4 – although hindered by cable-current effects – indicate the correctness of this approach. By inserting a slot in the upper arm of the dipole or inserting a spurline filter in the microstrip part of the antenna, a stop band from 5 GHz to 6 GHz may be realised. ...|$|E

40|$|The high {{cross-polarization}} of the microstrip integrated balun-fed printed {{dipole antenna}} cannot {{meet the demands}} of many engineering applications. This kind of antennas has high cross-polarization levels (about − 20 [*]dB). And we find that the high cross-polarization radiation is mainly produced by the microstrip integrated balun rather than the dipole itself. The very limited method to lower the cross-polarization level of this kind of antennas is to reduce the substrate thickness. In this paper, to improve the low cross-polarized performance, firstly, an equivalent model is presented to analyze the cross-polarization radiation. Secondly, a novel structure with low cross-polarization is proposed. The microstrip integrated balun is enclosed by a center slotted cavity. The E-field of the microstrip integrated balun is transformed parallel to the <b>dipole</b> <b>arms</b> by the slot, so the radiation of the cross-polarized component is suppressed. Measured results show that this structure can achieve a bandwidth wider than 40 % while reducing the cross-polarization level to less than − 35 [*]dB within the frequency band...|$|R

A 46 % continuous frequency tuning bandwidth is obtained by loading the driver <b>dipole</b> <b>arms</b> and four directors with varactor diodes. This configuration allows a high-gain {{and an almost}} constant end-fire pattern to be maintained while the antenna operating frequency is tuned. A parametric study was undertaken considering the inter-director spacing, director length tapering, and reflector geometry.

From 1 -dB compression point measurements, the maximum input power of the antenna with the present diodes is limited to 17. 6 dBm at 700 MHz. This suggests that reconfigurable antennas which use active components should have an IIP 3 specification placed on them.

The proposed radiating structure is integrated with a planar metal reflector useful to enhance antenna gain up to 5. 5 [*]dBi and the front-to-back ratio up to 21 [*]dB. The geometry of reflector, feeding line, and <b>dipole</b> <b>arms</b> is optimized {{in order to}} achieve a broad operating bandwidth useful to meet the requirements of modern wireless communication protocols. Furthermore, the particular shape of the metal reflector and the adoption of a thin low-permittivity dielectric substrate result in a low distortion of the radiated field and a limited back radiation which makes the antenna suitable for UWB applications as well. These features, together with the low profile and the limited occupation area, make the antenna well adapted to mobile terminals as well as radio base stations. A locally conformal FDTD numerical procedure has been adopted to design and analyse the radiating structure, while a SEM technique has been employed to highlight the field perturbation caused by the antenna reflector as well as to extract the characteristics underlying the transient behaviour of the antenna.

Atomic-scale computer simulation is used here to investigate their reaction with an edge dislocation gliding in alpha-iron under stress for the situation where b is inclined to the dislocation slip plane. b of small loops (37 SIAs here) changes spontaneously and the interstitials are absorbed as a pair of superjogs. The line glides forward at critical stress ?c when one or more vacancies are created and the jogs adopt a glissile form. A large loop (331 SIAs here) reacts spontaneously with the dislocation to form a segment with b =, which is sessile on the dislocation slip plane, and as applied stress increases the dislocation side arms are pulled into screw orientation. At low temperature (100 K), the segment remains sessile and the dislocation eventually breaks free when the screw <b>dipole</b> <b>arms</b> cross-slip and annihilate. At 300 K and above, the segment can glide across the loop and transform it into a pair of superjogs, which become glissile at ?c.

40|$|Every antenna {{requires}} a feed network to supply its RF energy. In {{the case of}} a simple dipole antenna, this could be a coaxial cable with a tuning element and matching balun. For mostly omnidirectional antennas, currents can easily couple to metallic surfaces inside an antenna's near field that includes the outer conductor of the coaxial feed line. These outer conductor currents can radiate into the far field to skew overall antenna radiation patterns. Other parameters such as VSWR may also be significantly affected. Electromagnetic field absorbers placed on the coaxial waveguide pose other problems where multiple RF carriers exist and non-linear dielectric materials can cause issues. Coil structures can also lead to radiation problems. This leads towards a metallic resonating choke solution, which will allow the antenna to radiate without affecting performance. The primary goal of this research is to integrate a metallic resonant choke structure that will prevent currents from travelling down the feed line outer conductor. In this work, an in-depth analysis is performed on each antenna component. This includes the feed network elements (waveguide coaxial line, tuning element, matching balun) and the radiator (<b>dipole</b> <b>arms,</b> resonant choke, outer feed). Each element is analyzed and designed to allow the manufactured antenna to have similar performance to its ideal center-fed counterpart for a tuned frequency band. To predict the performance of the manufactured antenna, several simulation models are constructed. To model the radiator and resonant choke structure, a Method of Moments code is written with Matlab. These results are compared with HFSS and measurements with good correlation. Specifically, the axisymmetric MoM code uses a KVL approach to integrate the internal choke structure that works well to reduce simulation time to a fraction of that taken by FEM solvers.

40|$|Cyclotriazadisulfonamide (CADA) {{compounds}} inhibit {{entry of}} HIV into host cells by down-modulating CD 4 receptor expression. These compounds reduce cell surface CD 4 expression levels by inhibiting human CD 4 protein synthesis in a co-translational translocation-dependent way. Previously, structure-activity relationships (SAR) {{studies have shown}} that CADA compounds apparently interact with two different arenesulfonyl binding sites. In this study, we investigated the relationship between electron density of one of the sulfonamide side arms of CADA and CD 4 down-modulation potency. A series of twenty six unsymmetrical CADA analogs having two different arenesulfonyl side-arms have been synthesized and evaluated for their CD 4 down-modulation properties. The CADA analog CK 147, having a cyclohexylmethyl tail group and one 4 -N,N-dimethylaminobenzenesulfonamide side arm, was found to have highest potency towards CD 4 down-modulation in CHO cells transfected with a fluorescent CD 4 fusion protein (IC 50 = 60 nM) and in the T-lymphoid cell line MT- 4 expressing human CD 4 naturally (IC 50 = 140 nM). In addition, the CK 147 -induced reduction in CD 4 correlated with enhanced anti-HIV- 1 NL 4. 3 activity (IC 50 = 180 nM). Generally, evaluation of the analogs suggested that CADA compounds having a larger dipole moment in one side arm and no hydrogen bond donor group, exhibit higher potencies for inhibition of CD 4 receptor expression.

40|$|Signal {{peptides}} {{are crucial}} in the biogenesis of eukaryotic proteins for the selective routing {{and delivery of}} secreted and membrane-bound proteins towards the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the specific interactions between these targeting signals and the other cellular components that facilitate protein translocation and membrane integration are not yet fully understood. Previously, our lab discovered a small molecule called CADA which specifically inhibits the synthesis and export of human CD 4, an important membrane glycoprotein in immune cells and the main receptor for the HIV virus. Recently, our lab could link the down-modulating activity of CADA to the signal peptide of CD 4 that led to selective inhibition of its co-translational translocation. This discovery creates {{a unique opportunity to}} investigate the molecular events that occur during the early stages of protein translocation. The goal of this project was to develop an in-depth model of the interaction between a chemical compound (CADA), signal peptides and the complex cellular protein translocation machinery. Signal peptides have diverse amino acid sequences and therefore offer an interesting target for selective regulation of protein translocation. Our model will expand the current understanding of signal peptide functioning and will allow us to develop an efficient screening model for the exploration of additional candidate molecules and signal peptide libraries. We expect these results to impact the development of innovative antiviral and medicinal applications. First, I contributed to a systematic analysis of CADA’s mode of action. The amino-terminal region of the CD 4 pre-protein, which includes the signal peptide, is necessary and sufficient for CADA sensitivity. The compound selectively interacts with this signal peptide and thereby inhibits co-translational translocation of CD 4 pre-proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Affected pre-protein chains incorrectly enter the cytosol, and become degraded by the proteasome. In accordance with one of the current signal peptide topology models, CD 4 initially enters the translocation channel in a ‘head-on’ orientation but its topology inverts at a certain length, to form a loop and to allow further translocation. CADA prevents this mandatory inversion and thereby blocks subsequent translocation of the chain. The inhibitory effect of CADA appeared to be selective for CD 4, so I aimed to identify additional targets of the compound in the next step. Using a PowerBlot Western array, I evaluated the abundance of over 400 proteins in CADA-treated SUP-T 1 cells and could identify sortilin as an additional substrate. CADA reduces sortilin expression by inhibition of the co-translational translocation in a signal peptide-dependent way, {{as is the case with}} CD 4. I also described the CD 4 down-modulation and antiviral activity of 28 new CADA analogs. This quantitative structure-activity relationship study identified a correlation between the arenesulfonyl side <b>arm</b> <b>dipole</b> moment and the biological compound activity. Additionally, analog CK 147 showed the highest potency of all analogs recorded to date, and was over 6 times more active compared to CADA. Finally, I refined our model of CADA’s action, by determining the contribution of individual amino acids in the CD 4 signal peptide towards CADA sensitivity with systematic mutagenesis. Two key residues in the CD 4 signal peptide, Gln- 15 and Pro- 20, were identified as critical for CADA action. Additionally, positively charged residues in the mature protein domain that lie directly C-terminal to the signal peptide cleavage site are also required for full sensitivity. However, analysis of the sortilin signal peptide suggested that primary structure information alone is not sufficient to predict CADA sensitivity, as a specific three-dimensional positioning of key residues in the signal peptide and subsequent mature protein domain is likely required for CADA action. status: publishe...|$|R
