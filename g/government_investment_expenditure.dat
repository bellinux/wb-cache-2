Just like most developing countries, South Africa has been using the fiscal policy framework as a tool to alleviate the high rates of unemployment. This study examined the impact of fiscal policy on unemployment in South Africa. The study used annual time series data for the period 1980 to 2010. A vector error correction model was used to determine the effects of fiscal policy aggregates on unemployment in South Africa. The fiscal policy aggregates considered in this study were <b>government</b> <b>investment</b> <b>expenditure,</b> government consumption expenditure and tax.

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{analysis of}} disaggregated government expenditure {{and economic growth}} in South AfricaThe motivation for this study stems from the weak economic growth {{that the country has}} been experiencing lately, coupled with the concern over government spending in South Africa. Estimating only the effect of government spending on economic growth is not enough; the different components of government spending should also be investigated in order to observe their relationships with economic growth. Earlier studies in South Africa considered the effects of total government spending on economic growth. This is the first study to our knowledge that disaggregated government spending into government investment spending and government consumption spending. This study, therefore, examines the effects of <b>government</b> <b>investment</b> <b>expenditure</b> and government consumption expenditure along with groups of control variables on economic growth in South Africa, using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) technique.

This paper provides {{a contribution to the}} debate, starting wiGth an endogenous growth model and extending it to account for the effects of corruption on components of government spending, namely military and investment spending. It then illustrates the non-negligible indirect effects of corruption on military spending and <b>government</b> <b>investment</b> <b>expenditure</b> using model simulations. The resulting model is then estimated on a comprehensive panel of 106 countries and the results show that the interactions between corruption and investment and corruption and military spending have strong negative impacts on economic growth. The results also indicate important complementarities between corruption and military spending, suggesting that combating corruption will not only have direct positive effects, but is also likely to have positive indirect effects, through reducing the size of the negative impact of the military burden. They are also found to be robust across different measures of corruption, levels of economic development and groupings of countries. This suggests that policies to reduce corruption, combined with those to reduce military burdens, such as regional security agreements, would have a considerable impact on economic growth...|$|E

40|$|The state's {{calculated}} {{intervention in}} the economy is an issue accepted by researchers. To fulfil the overall goals {{of the economy and}} to achieve its full potential, the state has to involve itself in the economics of production and distribution throughout the nation. Within this framework, the state national budget emerges as an essential method in the fiscal planning's implementation process. Thus, the economic policies' goals should comply with the goals of ûie economic plans. The Sultanate of Oman has adopted the economic planning approach since 1976, when successive five-year plans began. Since that time, a high level of investment in infrastructure and social services has been achieved. Nonetheless, by having a look at the economic indicators in the overall economy and in particular sectors, a significant conclusion can be drawn; that those indicators do not reflect the ambitious objectives outlined in the original development plans. As fiscal policies are {{on the top of the}} economic policies and methods, which some researchers hold responsible for economic success and failure, the main goal of this study is to investigate to what extent the fiscal policies in the Sultanate of Oman could play a positive role in accomplishing the developmental targets. To achieve the goals of the study, both quantitative and qualitative methods are utilized. Assessment and evaluation are used as secondary approaches and employ modem econometrics approaches as well as diagrammatic and tabular data representations. Examining the currently adopted fiscal policies in three areas, taxation, expenditure, and policies dealing with planned budgetary deficit and public debt and employing OLS, ECM methods, the most important findings show a wide gap between actual and potential tax revenues; tax rates positively relate to FDI inflows suggesting that foreign investors do not necessarily respond to tax incentives and that other determinants lie behind the deterioration of FDI inflows; <b>government</b> <b>investment</b> <b>expenditure</b> can be associated with lower growth; a crowding-out phenomenon exists between public investment and private investment indicating that the government investment in projects acting as a substitute for private investment; there is a negative link between foreign debt and growth; finally, the fiscal deficit is influencing the stance of the balance of payments negatively. Moreover, to inspect whether a fiscal policy aiming at rationalizing government expenditure in the Sultanate of Oman's economy may diminish the growth of output; in other words, to check whether the disaggregated government expenditures Granger-cause output or vice versa, the contemporaneous relationship between disaggregated public expenditure and GDP/GNP was examined. The study deployed the Johansen cointegration test, the standard Granger causality test and the Granger causality test in the context of an ECM, to determine the long-run relationship as well as the directions and patterns of causality between the disaggregated public expenditure and GDP/GNP. Neither the empirical results obtained sustain the Wagnerian law which states that economic growth causes the growth of government expenditure, nor was it possible to conclude in the favour of the opposing Keynesian hypothesis. Thus, the results do not support the argument that changes in government expenditure tend to accelerate or slow GDP/GNP growth" suggesting a proposition that a shrinking in government expenditure, as a strategy to control the fiscal imbalances in the Omani economy, could be adopted.

40|$|In this study, fiscal {{sustainability}} is defined {{consistent with the}} government intertemporal budget constraint framework which {{is related to the}} solvency of the government. Fiscal sustainability analysis in this context, therefore, considers the revenue side of the budget as well as the expenditure obligations. On the revenue side, the study highlights that fiscal authorities in South Africa continue to rely on income, profit and wealth taxes as they account for a larger share of government revenue compared to indirect taxes. However, immediately prior to the first democratic South Africa, there was a substantial shift from company taxes to personal taxes; a trend that has continued onto 2010. Analyses in this study show that the structure of the main taxes of South Africa compares less favourably to other emerging economies, and the worldwide averages. For instance, even though fiscal authorities have reduced the CIT rate from a high 50 % to 28 %, this rate is still higher when compared to other upper middle income economies {{and the rest of the}} world‟s average. The country compares no better either when the PIT rate is considered but its VAT rate compares favourably to that of the economies mentioned. Since the new era, in particular between 2000 and 2010, fiscal authorities in South Africa focussed on the reduction and stabilisation of marginal tax rates for the major taxes as well minimising the complexity in tax administration by reducing the number of tax brackets. Despite such effort, the wedge between the statutory rates and the realised average tax rates for the three main taxes is a concern regarding the protection of the revenue base. With regards to budget allocations, this study shows that collectively, expenditure on the social sector accounts for slightly below half of government consumption expenditure; specifically, however, there was a reduction in the proportional allocation to Education whilst at the same time the proportional allocations to Social Protection, Public Order and Safety and Social Grants increased. Defence expenditure was high pre- 1994 and immediately after the first democratic election, but declined in the later years of the democratic South Africa. In general, the policy of fiscal prudence after 1994 resulted in a substantial decline in debt service cost, whilst the real growth rate of the economy increased considerably. Nevertheless, the former still exceeded the latter for most part of the period between 1994 and 2010. Having reduced its debt burden over the past decades, the South African government again finds itself facing a problem of rising debt due to an increase in the fiscal deficit. On the basis of this background, this study addresses four broad questions, namely: (i) was the fiscal stance taken in the past, sufficient to attain {{fiscal sustainability}} in South Africa? (ii) How did fiscal policy in the past adjust to budget imbalances and to what extent did that affect fiscal sustainability? (iii) Which are the optimal ways to v protect the revenue base; and (iv) How does the current fiscal dispensation (i. e. composition of expenditure and tax) affect the economy and inter alia fiscal sustainability? Different econometric techniques, namely: the Smooth Transition Error Correction model; the Logistic quadratic model; the Currency Demand model and the Bayesian Structural Vector Auto Regression Model are applied in the analyses. The findings of this study suggest that fiscal policy over the sample period has been sustainable but likely to be adjusted more quickly when the budget deficit exceeds 4. 02 % of GDP. However, the stabilisation policies by fiscal authorities are fairly neutral at deficit levels below the estimated threshold; that is, at deficit levels of 4. 02 % of GDP and below. The fiscal reaction speed of the South African government (i. e. increasing the tax burden) to lower the large deficit levels towards a band of tolerable values, indicate that they are indeed concerned about solvency. Thus, on the basis of this historical fiscal stance, it can be expected that fiscal policy will remain sustainable in the medium-term; and that the government‟s projection to reduce the fiscal deficit from a high 5. 3 % of GDP in 2010 to 3. 0 % in 2015 is plausible. In South Africa the main fiscal challenge, therefore, is to find ways through which the recent gains in fiscal solvency are not at the expense of the future revenue base. Consequently, the next objective in this study is to analyse one important element of protecting the revenue base, namely, possible leakages from it. In this regard, shadow economic activity is being investigated. This study finds that on average, the size of the South African shadow economy is 22. 18 % of GDP with estimated revenue evaded at about 7 % of GDP. Further analysis shows that there is a strong positive relationship between the tax burden and shadow income but that this relationship is not symmetric. In South Africa, businesses and individuals are likely to react quicker when the tax burden changes fall outside the band of - 3. 64 % to + 2. 13 % of GDP but remains neutral as long as they are within this band. The implication of this finding is that, any attempt by the fiscal authorities to increase the tax burden to levels above the estimated threshold of 2. 13 % in order to close the budget deficit might trigger a significant response from the shadow economy thereby reducing the tax base and further worsening the fiscal deficit. Next, the analysis shows that an increase in total government spending has a “crowding–in” effect as real GDP per capita and real private investment respond positively. When government expenditure is disaggregated into consumption and capital expenditure per capita, the analysis shows that a one standard deviation positive shock in government consumption expenditure per capita increases real GDP per capita with a multiplier effect of 0. 22, which is higher than the growth multiplier effect (0. 16) of <b>government</b> <b>investment</b> <b>expenditure</b> per capita. In addition, the effect of the total tax burden on the GDP and private investment is negative and persistent in the long-term (i. e. after 4 years). The net effect of fiscal policy, therefore, is that it is growth enhancing in the short and medium-terms leading to fiscal sustainability (since r < g) but in the long-term, the growth promoting effects of increased public intervention is offset by the growth inhibiting effects of increased taxes; hence, a threat to long-term fiscal sustainability. vii The composition of the tax regime has a substantial influence on growth; whilst taxes on income and wealth reduce growth, indirect taxes have a positive effect on growth in the short and medium term. On the basis of the above findings the following suggestions are proposed: Firstly, the nature of fiscal policy in South Africa over the post- 1994 period has shown to be successful from a fiscal sustainability perspective and should therefore be continued. However, the fact that government only seem to be pro-active in the case when the budget deficit exceeds the 4 % margin and actually seem to be fairly neutral at deficit levels below this ratio should be noted. By implementing drastic tax increases in such a scenario could be detrimental to the growth of the revenue base. Conversely, tax relief at lower levels of the margin outlined, and even in times of surpluses could be growth enhancing and should be implemented actively. Secondly, the 2012 medium-term budget document requesting for additional taxes to boost revenue might lead to further growth in the shadow economy, as the projected tax burden increase recommended is above the estimated threshold of 2. 13 % in this study. Such a reaction from shadow income poses a threat to long-term fiscal sustainability. Thirdly, in their attempt to expand and secure the revenue base fiscal authorities in South Africa should consider further adjustments to the composition of the revenue base. The continuous reliance of the government on direct taxes is shown in this analysis to affect growth adversely, which could destabilise the fiscal gains already achieved. The results of this analysis, therefore, support the international trend towards a shift to indirect taxes from direct taxes. Fourthly, expenditure priorities have to be carefully considered. Fiscal authorities should guard against populist spending patterns and prioritise those expenditures that result in capacity building and enhancing growth and employment. In this regard, the declining trend in expenditure on education and health has to be reversed. A priori, only by focussing its expenditures coupled with enhanced efficiency within such “productive” areas, would government be able to contribute towards enhancing growth which in turn is essential for long-term fiscal sustainability. Thus, the analyses in this study show that in the short- and medium-term, there is no serious threat to fiscal sustainability in South Africa but long-term fiscal sustainability remains a challenge. To enhance long-term fiscal sustainability would require continuous adjustment of policies including the speed of policy adjustment, the stabilisation of the tax burden but with a redirection of focus from direct to indirect taxes; the protection of the revenue base, in particular a reduction in the existing level of tax revenue evaded and the reprioritisation of government expenditures. A broader social and political context of fiscal sustainability has, however, not been included in this study. In a middle income country like South Africa where the role of government is politically and socially important and controversial, future research could explore how the quest to enhance fiscal consolidation can affect political and social stability which may in turn endanger the sustainability of fiscal policy. On the other hand quantifying the fiscal implications of expected developments such as demographic changes, development in health cost and public pension liabilities, could initiate future research on this topic should more relevant data becomes available.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between interest rates and private investment with the economic growth in Pakistan. One of the primary plans of economic policies is to increase investment that is important for better economic performance. using time series analysis and annual data from 1980 - 2010. The structural equation model is used {{to find out the}} relations of the variables in the model with help of the regression equations. The empirical results indicate that private <b>investment,</b> <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> and labor force have significant positive effect on gross domestic product but foreign direct investment has negative and statistically significant relation with gross domestic product. There also exists a unique long-run relationship between economic growth and its determinants, including interest rate. The results imply that the behavior of interest rate is important for economic growth in view of the relationships between interest rates and investment and investment and growth. Private <b>investment,</b> <b>government</b> <b>expenditure</b> and foreign direct investment first individually estimated than used the estimated values in main equation of the study...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a new {{approach}} to estimate how government expenditures affect the growth rate of real GDP. They affect the growth rate through three channels - total factor productivity, investment and aggregate demand. We find that apart from <b>government</b> <b>investment,</b> all <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> have negative marginal effects on productivity and GDP growth. In particular, a 1 percentage point increase in the share of government consumption in GDP reduces the equilibrium GDP growth rate by 0. 216 percentage points, while the same increase in <b>government</b> <b>investment</b> raises the growth rate by 0. 167 percentage points. This suggests that a reallocation of 1 percentage point of government consumption to <b>government</b> <b>investment</b> can raise the growth rate by 0. 38 percentage points.

40|$|The Armey curve {{shows that}} there is a {{non-linear}} relationship between government size and economic growth. This paper uses threshold regression model to study relationship between government size and economic growth during 1967 - 2007 in Iran. The results show that linear methods are not capable to explain the relationship between <b>government</b> <b>expenditure</b> (including <b>investment</b> <b>expenditure,</b> consumption xpenditure and total expenditure) and economic growth. The findings indicate government expenditure has positive effect on economic growth, but after crossing a threshold, this effect turn reversed. The thresholds are estimated 22. 8 % for total expenditure ratio, 9. 8 % for <b>investment</b> <b>expenditure</b> and 12. 9 % for consumption expenditure. The ratio of consumption expenditure is far away the threshold in 2007. Therefore, reconsidering in quantity, quality and efficiency of this expenditure is necessary...|$|R

The simplistic multiplier {{that is the}} reciprocal of the marginal propensity to save is a special case used for illustrative purposes only. The multiplier applies to any change in autonomous expenditure, in other words, an externally induced change in consumption, <b>investment,</b> <b>government</b> <b>expenditure</b> or net exports. Each of these operates to increase or reduce the equilibrium level of income in the economy.|$|R

The final demand for each product comes from activities (intermediate consumption), households (final consumption), <b>government</b> (public <b>expenditure),</b> <b>investment,</b> {{and the rest of}} the world (exports). The linear expenditure system (LES) determines the consumption of households and government with a constant fraction of agents’ disposable income allocated to each commodity.|$|R

The targeted variables are real values and deflators for GDP, consumption, <b>investment,</b> <b>government</b> <b>expenditure,</b> exports, and imports. First, {{with respect to}} seasonality, an entirely different conclusion is obtained for the real values and the deflators of the data series examined.
