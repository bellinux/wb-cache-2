50|$|There is {{a native}} {{marsupial}} known as the phalanger or the <b>grey</b> <b>cuscus,</b> Phalanger orientalis. The only other mammals are bats and rodents. There are many species of colourful parrots as well as estuarine crocodiles. In recent times, these crocodiles have been found only on the Weather Coast {{in the south of}} the island, but during the Second World War, they were found along the north coast {{in the vicinity of the}} airstrip where the fighting was taking place, as evidenced by names such as Alligator Creek. Venomous snakes are rare and are not considered to be a serious threat; however, there is a kind of centipede which gives a particularly nasty bite. These centipedes were well known to the American Marines during the Second World War as 'the stinging insects'.|$|E
