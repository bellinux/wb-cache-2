25|$|Views was previewed in London, {{before its}} premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was {{released}} as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being {{made available to}} various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the U.S., and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units {{in the first week}} of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later plan to release a short film entitled Please <b>Forgive</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E

500|$|With all appeal avenues {{exhausted}} and no further motivation to deny his crimes, Bundy agreed to speak frankly with investigators. To Keppel, {{he confessed to}} all eight of the Washington and Oregon homicides {{for which he was}} the prime suspect. He described three additional previously unknown victims in Washington and two in Oregon whom he declined to identify (if indeed he ever knew their identities). He said he left a fifth corpse—Donna Manson's—on Taylor Mountain, but incinerated her head in Kloepfer's fireplace. ("Of all the things I did to ," [...] he told Keppel, [...] "this is probably the one she is least likely to <b>forgive</b> <b>me</b> for. Poor Liz.") ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1967, while {{awaiting}} {{the consequences of}} the police raid, Jagger, Richards and Jones took a short trip to Morocco, accompanied by Marianne Faithfull, Jones' girlfriend Anita Pallenberg and other friends. During this trip the stormy relations between Jones and Pallenberg deteriorated to the point that Pallenberg left Morocco with Richards. Richards said later: [...] "That was the final nail in the coffin with me and Brian. He'd never <b>forgive</b> <b>me</b> for that and I don't blame him, but hell, shit happens." [...] Richards and Pallenberg would remain a couple for twelve years. Despite these complications, the Rolling Stones toured Europe in March and April 1967. The tour included the band's first performances in Poland, Greece, and Italy.|$|E
500|$|The long-held view is {{that the}} Empress {{accepted}} the circumscribed role in which she found herself, and that her life, duty and purpose were tied to her position as the Emperor's wife. However, her personal letters reveal that she could be strongheaded, sometimes at odds with her husband, and had a life of her own—albeit somewhat restricted. In a letter written on 2 May 1845 she stated: [...] "I wait for the moment when we will meet, good Pedro, and seek forgiveness for all that I did to you during these days." [...] In another letter of 24 January 1851, she acknowledged her difficult temperament: [...] "I am not irritated at you [...] and you should <b>forgive</b> <b>me</b> because this is my character." ...|$|E

This position, too, proved fleeting. By the end of May, Sibelius had settled on , and the tone poem appeared under this title, albeit misspelled, on the 4June Norfolk Festival program: [...] " [...] —Tone Poem (Nymphs of the Ocean)". In preparation for the publication of the tone poem by Breitkopf & Härtel in June 1915, Sibelius included alongside the Finnish title, , an [...] "explanatory" [...] German translation, [...] (in English: The Oceanides). The piece was published as Op.73 and dedicated to Mr. and Mrs. Carl Stoeckel.|$|E
500|$|In January 1801, Benedict Arnold's health {{began to}} decline. He had {{suffered}} from gout since 1775, and the condition attacked his unwounded leg {{to the point}} where he was unable to go to sea. The other leg ached constantly, and he walked only with a cane. His physicians diagnosed him as having dropsy, and a visit to the countryside only temporarily improved his condition. He died after four days of delirium on June 14, 1801, at the age of 60. Legend has it that, when he was on his deathbed, he said, [...] "Let me die in this old uniform in which I fought my battles. May God <b>forgive</b> <b>me</b> for ever having put on another," [...] but this story may be apocryphal. Arnold was buried at St. Mary's Church, Battersea in London, England. As a result of a clerical error in the parish records, his remains were removed to an unmarked mass grave during church renovations a century later. His funeral procession boasted [...] "seven mourning coaches and four state carriages"; the funeral was without military honors.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Scott {{was asked}} [...] "Who's the biggest {{pain in the}} arse you've ever worked with?", he replied: [...] "It's got to be Harrison... he'll <b>forgive</b> <b>me</b> because now I get on with him. Now he's become charming. But he knows a lot, that's the problem. When we worked {{together}} {{it was my first}} film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie." [...] Ford said of Scott in 2000: [...] "I admire his work. We had a bad patch there, and I'm over it." [...] In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying: [...] "What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another." [...] Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD, and had already recorded his interviews. [...] "Harrison's fully on board", said Scott.|$|E

500|$|On 28 June 1989, the 600th {{anniversary of}} the Battle of Kosovo, Đujić granted the title of vojvoda to Vojislav Šešelj, and ordered him [...] "to expel all Croats, Albanians, and other foreign {{elements}} from holy Serbian soil", stating he would return only when Serbia was cleansed of [...] "the last Jew, Albanian, and Croat". Šešelj {{was at the time}} an anti-Communist dissident and was subsequently described for his activities in the Yugoslav Wars as [...] "a man whose killer commando units operating in Croatia and Bosnia carried on the very worst of the Chetnik tradition." [...] Later Šešelj became leader of the Serbian Radical Party, a government coalition partner of Serbian President Slobodan Milosević. In 1998, Đujić publicly stated that he regretted awarding that title to Šešelj. He was quoted as saying, [...] "I was naïve when I nominated Šešelj [...] Vojvoda; I ask my people to <b>forgive</b> <b>me.</b> The greatest gravedigger of Serbdom is Slobodan Milošević" [...] and that he is [...] "disappointed in Šešelj for openly collaborating with Milošević's Socialist Party, with Communists who have only changed their name.

500|$|Digby {{was tried}} {{on the same}} day as seven of his {{surviving}} co-conspirators, in Westminster Hall, on Monday 27 January 1606. [...] As the king and his family watched in secret, the charges against the plotters were read aloud. [...] Alone amongst them Digby pleaded [...] "Guilty", and was tried on a separate indictment. [...] Dressed in a black satin suit and [...] "tuff taffetie gown", he gave a short and moving speech, defending his actions by explaining his affection for Catesby, and the cause of his religion. [...] He accused King James of reneging on his promises of toleration for Catholics, and told of his fears of harsher laws against recusancy. [...] He also pleaded on behalf of his family, that they should not pay for his actions, before making a final request to be beheaded. [...] His words fell on mostly deaf ears. [...] The prosecution poured scorn on James's supposed perfidy, and ridiculed Digby for asking for leniency where he would have given none. [...] Along with the other plotters, he was found guilty. [...] As they were led from the hall, Digby exclaimed: [...] "If I may but hear any of your lordships say, you <b>forgive</b> <b>me,</b> I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows." [...] The reply came back, [...] "God forgive you, and we do." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the meeting}} of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state. Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a {{solution}} to his problems. On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the Château de Blois. As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died {{at the foot of the}} king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons. Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, [...] "Please <b>forgive</b> <b>me.</b> Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again. I have had him killed. I have done to him what he was going to do to me." [...] Catherine's immediate reaction is not known; but on Christmas Day, she told a friar, [...] "Oh, wretched man! What has he done?... Pray for him... I see him rushing towards his ruin." [...] She visited her old friend Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to tell him she was sure he would soon be freed. He shouted at her, [...] "Your words, Madam, have led us all to this butchery." [...] She left in tears.|$|E

500|$|Each of the condemned, said Coke, {{would be}} drawn {{backwards}} to his death, by a horse, his head near the ground. [...] He {{was to be}} [...] "put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both". [...] His genitals would be cut off and burnt before his eyes, and his bowels and heart then removed. [...] Then he would be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of his body displayed {{so that they might}} become [...] "prey for the fowls of the air". [...] Confessions and declarations from the prisoners were then read aloud, and finally the prisoners were allowed to speak. [...] Rookwood claimed that he had been drawn into the plot by Catesby, [...] "whom he loved above any worldy man". [...] Thomas Wintour begged to be hanged for himself and his brother, so that his brother might be spared. [...] Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment. [...] Keyes appeared to accept his fate, Bates and Robert Wintour begged for mercy, and Grant explained his involvement as [...] "a conspiracy intended but never effected". [...] Only Digby, tried on a separate indictment, pleaded guilty, insisting that the King had reneged upon promises of toleration for Catholics, and that affection for Catesby and love of the Catholic cause mitigated his actions. [...] He sought death by the axe and begged mercy from the King for his young family. [...] His defence was in vain; his arguments were rebuked by Coke and Northumberland, and along with his seven co-conspirators, he was found guilty by the jury of high treason. [...] Digby shouted [...] "If I may but hear any of your lordships say, you <b>forgive</b> <b>me,</b> I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows." [...] The response was short: [...] "God forgive you, and we do." ...|$|E
