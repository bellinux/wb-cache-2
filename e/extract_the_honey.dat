50|$|A honey {{extractor}} is a mechanical device used in <b>the</b> extraction of <b>honey</b> from honeycombs. A <b>honey</b> extractor <b>extracts</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> from <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> comb without destroying the comb. Extractors work by centrifugal force. A drum or container holds a frame basket which spins, flinging <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> out. With this method the wax comb stays intact within {{the frame and}} can be reused by the bees.|$|R
50|$|Once uncapped, {{the frames}} are then {{placed in a}} honey extractor, which spins them so that most of <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> is removed by {{centrifugal}} force. Care {{must be taken to}} ensure that all frames are loaded correctly, as the comb is angled slightly upwards to prevent <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> flowing out; if loaded incorrectly, this can also prevent <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> flowing out during extraction. Once <b>extracted,</b> <b>the</b> resulting <b>honey</b> will contain bits of wax and must be passed through a screen so that clean liquid honey results.|$|R
50|$|A {{hive frame}} or honey frame is a {{structural}} element in a beehive {{that holds the}} honeycomb or brood comb within the hive enclosure. The hive frame is {{a key part of}} the modern movable-comb hive. It can be removed in order to inspect the bees for disease or to <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> excess <b>honey.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rapeseed {{produces}} great {{quantities of}} nectar, and honeybees produce a light-colored but peppery honey from it.

50|$|A common {{chimpanzee}} {{from the}} Kasakela chimpanzee community {{was the first}} nonhuman animal reported making a tool, by modifying a twig to use as an instrument for extracting termites from their mound. At Taï, chimps simply use their hands to extract termites. When foraging for honey, chimps use modified short sticks to scoop the honey out of the hive, that is, if the bees are stingless. For hives of the dangerous African honeybees, chimps use longer and thinner sticks to <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey.</b> Chimps also fish for ants using the same tactic.|$|E
50|$|When beekeepers <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey,</b> {{they cut}} off the wax caps from each {{honeycomb}} cell with an uncapping knife or machine. Its color varies from nearly white to brownish, but most often a shade of yellow, depending on purity, the region, {{and the type of}} flowers gathered by the bees. Wax from the brood comb of the honey bee hive tends to be darker than wax from the honeycomb. Impurities accumulate more quickly in the brood comb. Due to the impurities, the wax must be rendered before further use. The leftovers are called slumgum.|$|E
40|$|Background: What is <b>the</b> issue? Premium <b>honeys</b> from Australia and New Zealand, in {{particular}} <b>honey</b> derived from <b>the</b> Leptospermum species Manuka and Jellybush, retail for high {{prices on the}} international and domestic market due to their high bioactivity. However, these honeys are increasingly being counterfeited or substituted with cheaper imitations. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop robust analytical protocols for authenticating the floral source of honeys. This will provide market protection for the beekeepers and the consumers. Research questions? Can chromatographic profiles of phenolic and volatile compounds in Australian and New Zealand honeys be used to authenticate the floral source? Do the phenolic compounds in <b>honey</b> contribute to <b>the</b> biological properties, including anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory? Which honey types and phenolic compounds within <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> have <b>the</b> greatest bioactivity? Methods: How was research performed? Volatile and phenolic compounds are currently being chemically fingerprinted using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Preparative chromatography of <b>the</b> phenolic <b>extract</b> has commenced to isolate compounds from <b>honeys.</b> <b>The</b> anti-bacterial activity of <b>the</b> purified phenolic <b>extracts</b> in <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> is currently being investigated, using a well diffusion assay against Staphylococcus aureus. The anti-inflammatory properties of <b>the</b> purified phenolic <b>extracts</b> in <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> will be investigated, {{in particular}} the inhibition of the pro-inflammatory enzyme 5 -lipoxygenase and leukotriene B 4. Research findings: Unique biomarker compounds are currently being identified {{for a range of}} honey samples that have been analysed. Mislabelled commercial honeys have been identified. All of <b>the</b> phenolic <b>extracts</b> from <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> samples inhibited Staphylococcus aureus. All <b>honeys</b> and <b>the</b> fractioned compound methyl syringate, common to all of <b>the</b> analysed <b>honeys,</b> have shown inhibition of the pro-inflammatory 5 -LOX enzyme, indicating potential anti-inflammatory activity.

5000|$|Apart from <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> stored within <b>the</b> central brood frames, {{the bees}} store surplus honey in combs above the brood nest. In modern hives the {{beekeeper}} places separate boxes, called [...] "supers", above the brood box, {{in which a}} series of shallower combs is provided for storage of <b>honey.</b> This enables <b>the</b> beekeeper to {{remove some of the}} supers in the late summer, and to <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> surplus <b>honey</b> harvest, without damaging the colony of bees and its brood nest below. If all <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> is [...] "stolen", including <b>the</b> amount of <b>honey</b> needed to survive winter, the beekeeper must replace these stores by feeding the bees sugar or corn syrup in autumn.|$|R
50|$|Some {{hobbyist}} beekeepers and beekeepers {{in developing}} countries, especially keepers of top-bar hives, cut <b>the</b> whole <b>honey</b> comb {{out of the}} frame, and use it directly as cut comb honey.

5000|$|Radial baskets {{have the}} top {{bar of the}} frame facing {{outwards}} while tangential baskets have {{one side of the}} comb facing outward. Large commercial extractors are radial and rely on the upward slope of the comb cells. This slope allows to extract honey by applying centrifugal force toward the upper edge of the comb (opposite to the direction of gravity while in the hive). The amount of work during extraction is reduced in the radial type because the frames {{do not have to be}} turned over to <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> from the other side of the comb (however some extractors are capable of turning combs automatically). Hobbyist extractors can be hand or electric motor powered. If the extractor is hand powered, it often has accelerating gear to spin with less effort.|$|E
50|$|Skeps, baskets placed open-end-down, {{have been}} used to house bees for some 2000 years. Initially they were made from wicker {{plastered}} with mud and dung but from the Middle Ages they were made of straw. In northern and western Europe, skeps were made of coils of grass or straw. In its simplest form, there is a single entrance {{at the bottom of the}} skep. Again, there is no internal structure provided for the bees and the colony must produce its own honeycomb, which is attached to the inside of the skep. Skeps have two disadvantages; beekeepers cannot inspect the comb for diseases and pests, and honey removal is difficult and often results in the destruction of the entire colony. To get the honey beekeepers either drove the bees out of the skep or, by the use of a bottom extension called an eke or a top extension called a cap, sought to create comb with just honey in it. Quite often the bees were just killed, sometimes using lighted sulfur, to allow the honeycomb to be removed. Skeps could also be squeezed in a vise to <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey.</b> As of 1998, most US states prohibited the use of skeps because they can not be inspected for disease and parasites.|$|E

60|$|That evening, {{over the}} camp fire, George Curtis told us his story, which, in its way, {{was almost as}} eventful as our own, and, put shortly, {{amounted}} to this. A little {{less than two years}} before, he had started from Sitanda's Kraal, to try to reach Suliman's Berg. As for the note I had sent him by Jim, that worthy lost it, and he had never heard of it till to-day. But, acting upon information he had received from the natives, he headed not for Sheba's Breasts, but for the ladder-like descent of the mountains down which we had just come, which is clearly a better route than that marked out in old Dom Silvestra's plan. In the desert he and Jim had suffered great hardships, but finally they reached this oasis, where a terrible accident befell George Curtis. On the day of their arrival he was sitting by the stream, and Jim was <b>extracting</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> from <b>the</b> nest of a stingless bee which {{is to be found in}} the desert, on the top of a bank immediately above him. In so doing he loosened a great boulder of rock, which fell upon George Curtis's right leg, crushing it frightfully. From that day he had been so lame that he found it impossible to go either forward or back, and had preferred to take the chances of dying in the oasis to the certainty of perishing in the desert.|$|R

40|$|Improved hive {{management}} Cue: Beehives come in many {{shapes and}} sizes. Traditional beehives are often made from hollowed out logs. A more modern type of beehive is the top-bar beehive, {{and the most}} sophisticated beehive is called a Langstroth beehive. This was designed by an American, the Reverend Lorenzo Langstroth, back in 1851. One {{of the advantages of}} the Langstroth hive is that the bees construct their honeycombs in frames which can be removed from the hive. This allows beekeepers to <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> without damaging the honeycomb, and then put the comb back into the hive. As a result, they can make more harvests each year, and get top quality honey. However, Langstroth hives are also more difficult to make. Carpenters may need specialised equipment and training, as the measurements of the structures in the hive must be extremely accurate. Many attempts to introduce Langstroth hives in Africa, particularly among rural communities, have failed. One organisation that has had some success however, is Honey Care Africa, which not only manufactures the hives, but also trains community members in beekeeping skills. Eric Kadenge visited their workshop in Nairobi, and spoke to operations manager Margaret Mimoh about their work. IN:		?This is the workshop, this is where ? OUT:		?are going to a group in Mount Kenya. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 46 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Margaret Mimoh, operations manager for Honey Care Africa, an organisation that promotes sustainable community beekeeping in East Africa. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mimoh	This is the workshop, this is where we do the manufacture of hives and we are promoting Langstroth beehives. But when it comes to marketing, we are also helping or supporting the farmers who have different, other types of hives, through our own training, and we help them to improve on the techniques in handling the honey so that they come up with quality honey that conforms to the requirements of the market. Kadenge	Now why do you specifically concentrate or promote Langstroth beehives? Mimoh	Because we came to realise that Langstroth beehives give quality honey and also the production in Langstroth hive is a bit high as compared to the other hives. And especially it is women friendly, because the women can also take up beekeeping. Kadenge	What makes it more friendly to women? Mimoh	Because when it comes to inspections, the hives are placed on hanging stands, which are a bit lower compared to the log hives which were being placed up on top of trees and women cannot climb on top of trees to do inspections. And it is also next to the homestead, and it is very easy for women to carry out inspections. Kadenge	So take us through some of the steps that one needs to take. Mimoh	In fact what has to happen is the beekeeper has to ensure that he has the right equipment to help him manage the hives effectively. So we are talking in terms of the bee suit which is the protective clothing, and we have the smoker, we have the protective gloves and we have the gumboots. So he puts them on and goes to the hive, opening up the hive and checking inside to know what is the progress in the hive, and this will give him the indication of what to do next. Kadenge	And when it comes to observation, what do you need to observe and at what times? Mimoh	Normally inspection is done in the evening because the bees are quite cool at that particular time. So what will happen is, once the farmer goes to the hive in the evening, he has to check the strength of the colony. In that case he will also even see the laying pattern of the queen, which will give him an indication of whether the queen is active or not active. Because if the queen is not active then the laying pattern is so poorly done and the colony is so weak, so getting some good amounts of honey becomes a problem and also the building pattern of the bees becomes too slow. Kadenge	In the event that the laying patterns are poor, what would the farmer need to do? Mimoh	He will definitely know that the colony is a bit weak so he can also do the merging of the colonies or re-queening of the hive. Kadenge	Any other thing that the farmer would observe? Mimoh	If the farmer observes things like pests, he will definitely know what is the remedy I have to take or the action I have to take against this. In case of ants, crawling ants, he should definitely manage his apiary by cutting long grass. He can put also some ash or used oil around the post or modify a pond of water around the post so that the bees can use the water and the pests can drown in the water. Kadenge	Is there any other thing {{that you would like to}} add regarding management of beehives? Mimoh	If you don?t manage your hives then don?t expect a harvest. And this has been a practice that has been taken into account by most of the beekeepers who are born beekeepers. Maybe they just hang their hive, wait for six months and think that they are going to get honey out of it. But we have realised, or that is a challenge we have faced, if you don?t manage your hive very well you don?t get the honey. And you find that is why we are saying the Langstroth hive is women friendly, and the women are really doing very well. And in this case you find that they really take into account the inspections of the hive. And the moment they do that, they are really assured of the harvest and the quality of the honey they produced and the income that is going to be generated from that. You are also promoting nutrition within the families, because they get to know the value of using honey as a nutritional factor within the communities. Kadenge	So how many hives do you manufacture in this particular room in a given time? Mimoh	What I would say is that we work in partnership with non governmental organisations, community based organisations and even the government of Kenya. So what happens with the NGOs and the community groups on the ground, they would give us an order of the hives. So let?s say they have given us an order for 200 hives. We would take even two weeks to manufacture it and send it out. Kadenge	So right now we are looking at how many hives here? Mimoh	Right now we have three hundred. Kadenge	And they are destined to go where? Mimoh	About fifty of them are going to a group in Sudan and some are going to a group in western Kenya and some are going to a group in Mount Kenya. End of track. What beekeepers need to look for when they are inspecting their hives...|$|E
50|$|Broadcast 5 December 1990, {{this episode}} {{concentrates}} on animal communication. In Kenya, Attenborough accompanies a tribesman who calls to a honeyguide, {{which in turn}} answers him and leads the pair to a bees' nest. <b>The</b> tribesman <b>extracts</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey,</b> and some is left to reward the bird. African hunting dogs are shown hunting gazelles, of which the target is the individual that leaps lowest. Larks evade merlin by sending a similar message: by continuing to sing while being chased, it tells the pursuer that its prey is fit and therefore {{will be difficult to}} catch (see handicap principle). (In 80% of cases this turns out to be true.) Vervet monkeys' cries are among the most complex. Their utterances are effectively words: a vocabulary that defines each of their predators, so an alarm call is specific to a particular threat. Some creatures transmit their presence by display, and Attenborough observes thousands of fireflies illuminating the darkness. Sounds travel faster and further underwater, and over 200 species of fish use them to communicate. In turn, sea lions have become adept at sensing their proximity. However, the most visual aquatic animal is the squid, which uses colour change and posture to communicate. Finally, Attenborough swims with spotted dolphins. They converse with a series of ultrasonic clicks, and each has a family call inherited from its mother: effectively a 'surname'. They also use normal sound, body posture and touch — in short, in terms of ability to communicate, they are man's closest rival.|$|R

The method was linear between 5 ìg/kg and 200 ìg/kg of honey for p-dichlorobenzene and 1 ìg/kg and 200 ìg/kg of honey for naphthalene. Limits of detection were 1 ìg/kg and 0. 1 ìg/kg respectively. The relative standard deviations were 2. 59 % and 7. 92 % for p-dichlorobenzene and naphthalene respectively. Application of the method to 90 unifloral Greek honeys revealed that in 25. 6 % of the samples the concentration of either one of the pesticides overreached the Maximum Residue Level (MRL) value. Maximum concentrations were 163. 03 ìg/kg of honey for p-dichlorobenzene and 193. 74 ìg/kg of honey for naphthalene. Naphthalene was found in traceable amounts in 78. 9 % of the samples, but only 5. 6 % of them contained concentrations above the MRL value. This indicates the use of pre-contaminated honey comb foundations or built combs.

40|$|SummaryPopulation and group-specific {{behavioral}} {{differences have}} been taken as evidence for animal cultures [1 – 10], a notion that remains controversial. Skeptics argue that ecological or genetic factors, rather than social learning, provide a more parsimonious explanation [11 – 14]. Work with captive chimpanzees has addressed this criticism by showing that experimentally created traditions can be transmitted through social learning [15 – 17]. Recent fieldwork further suggests that ecological and genetic factors are insufficient to explain the behavioral differences seen between communities, but the data are only observational [18, 19]. Here, we present {{the results of a}} field experiment [20, 21] that compared the performance of chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii) from two Ugandan communities, Kanyawara and Sonso, on an identical task in <b>the</b> physical domain—extracting <b>honey</b> from holes drilled into horizontal logs. Kanyawara chimpanzees, who occasionally use sticks to acquire honey [4], spontaneously manufactured sticks to <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> experimentally provided <b>honey.</b> In contrast, Sonso chimpanzees, who possess a considerable leaf technology but no food-related stick use [4, 22], relied on their fingers, but some also produced leaf sponges to access <b>the</b> <b>honey.</b> Our results indicate that, when genetic and environmental factors are controlled, wild chimpanzees rely on their cultural knowledge to solve a novel task...|$|R

Two thin-layer chromatography fractions of <b>the</b> cocoon <b>extract</b> eliciting arrestment were found to contain saturated C 17 to C 22 primary aliphatic alcohols and C 19 to C 22 aldehydes. We analyzed <b>extracts</b> of <b>the</b> cocoon and different larvae, pupae, and adults of both worker and drone A. mellifera to determine the relative amounts of these chemostimuli in the different substrates employed by Varroa. Both aldehydes and alcohols were more abundant in the cocoon than in the cuticle of adult or developing bees. Mixtures of the aliphatic alcohols and aldehydes at the proportions found in the cocoons acted synergistically on the arrestment response, but this activity disappeared when mixed in equal amounts. When these oxygenated chemostimuli were mixed with C 19 to C 25 alkanes at the proportions found in <b>the</b> cocoon <b>extract,</b> we observed a significantly lower threshold for the chemostimulant mixture. These results indicate how Varroa may use mixtures of rarer products to differentiate between substrates and host stages during its developmental cycle within honey bee brood cells...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Keloid {{is a type}} of scar {{which extends}} beyond the {{boundaries}} of the original wound. It can spread to the surrounding skin by invasion. The use of Tualang honey is a possible approach for keloid treatment. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the antiproliferative effect of methanolic extraction of Tualang honey to primary human keloid fibroblasts and to identify the volatile compounds in methanol extraction of Tualang honey. Methods Crude Tualang honey was extracted with methanol and then dried using rota vapor to remove remaining methanol from honey. Normal and keloid fibroblasts were verified and treated with <b>the</b> <b>extracted</b> <b>honey.</b> Cell proliferation was tested with [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yi) - 5 -(3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl) - 2 -(4 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium, inner salt] (MTS) assay. Extraction of Tualang honey using methanol was carried out and <b>the</b> <b>extracted</b> samples were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The result was analysed using SPSS and tested with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Results Methanolic extraction of honey has positive anti proliferative effect on keloid fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of fatty acids such as palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and octadecanoic acid may contribute to the anti-proliferative effect in keloid fibroblasts. Conclusions <b>The</b> methanolic <b>honey</b> extraction has an antiproliferative effect on keloid fibroblasts and a range of volatile compounds has been identified from Tualang <b>honey.</b> <b>The</b> antiproliferative effect of keloid fibroblasts towards Tualang honey may involve cell signaling pathway. Identifying other volatile compounds from different organic solvents should be carried out in future. </p...|$|R
50|$|Lost-wax casting, {{a common}} {{metalworking}} method typically found where the inhabitants keep bees, {{was also used}} by the Maya.

If <b>the</b> hive was damaged beyond repair, the whole of the comb could be used, thus using all of the hive.
