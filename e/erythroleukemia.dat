40|$|J 2 E cells produce rapid, fatal <b>erythroleukemias</b> in vivo {{but still}} respond to {{erythropoietin}} (epo) in vitro by differentiating, proliferating and remaining viable {{in the absence}} of serum. Mutant epo receptors were introduced into these cells to determine whether they could influence the different biological responses to epo in vitro and the development of <b>erythroleukemias.</b> Three mutant receptors were used as cytoplasmic truncation mutants Delta 257 and Delta 321 (above box 1 and below box 2 respectively), and the cytoplasmic point mutant W 282 R (defective for JAK 2 activation). Strikingly, the Delta 321 mutation produced a hyper-sensitive response in vitro to epo-induced differentiation and viability, but not to proliferation. In contrast with the Delta 321 receptor, the Delta 257 and W 282 R mutants inhibited all biological responses to epo due to impaired JAK 2 phosphorylation. Significantly, <b>erythroleukemias</b> took almost twice as long to develop with cells containing the W 282 R mutation, indicating that JAK 2 {{plays an important role in}} the emergence of these leukemias. These data demonstrate that mutant epo receptors dominantly altered responses of J 2 E cells to epo in culture and the development of <b>erythroleukemias.</b> Oncogene (2000) 19, 953 - 960...|$|R
5000|$|Fli-1 is {{a member}} of the ETS {{transcription}} factor family that was first identified in <b>erythroleukemias</b> induced by Friend Murine Leukemia Virus (F-MuLV). Fli-1 is activated through retroviral insertional mutagenesis in 90% of F-MuLV-induced <b>erythroleukemias.</b> The constitutive activation of fli-1 in erythroblasts leads to a dramatic shift in the Epo/Epo-R signal transduction pathway, blocking erythroid differentiation, activating the Ras pathway, and resulting in massive Epo-independent proliferation of erythroblasts. These results suggest that Fli-1 overexpression in erythroblasts alters their responsiveness to Epo and triggers abnormal proliferation by switching the signaling event(s) associated with terminal differentiation to proliferation.|$|R

These were larger than an independently isolated Sfpi- 1 cDNA described by researchers from another laboratory, and they contained common differences from that sequence, {{including in the}} coding region four extra nucleotides that altered the reading frame. The properly translated protein is identical to Pu. 1, a transcription activation factor that {{is related to the}} ets oncogene family.

40|$|Myeloid leukemia factor 1 (MLF 1) {{is a novel}} oncoprotein {{involved}} in translocations associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially <b>erythroleukemias.</b> In this study, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of Mlf 1 prevented J 2 E erythroleukemic cells from undergoing biological and morphological maturation in response to erythropoietin (Epo). We show that Mlf 1 inhibited Epo-induced cell cycle exit and suppressed {{a rise in the}} cell cycle inhibitor p 27 Kip 1. Unlike differentiating J 2 E cells, Mlf 1 -expressing cells did not downregulate Cull and Skp 2, components of the ubiquitin E 3 ligase complex SCFSkp 2 {{involved in}} the proteasomal degradation of p 27 Kip 1. In contrast, Mlf 1 did not interfere with increases in p 27 Kip 1 and terminal differentiation initiated by thyroid hormone withdrawal from erythroid cells, or cytokine-stimulated maturation of myeloid cells. These data demonstrate that Mlf 1 interferes with an Epo-responsive pathway involving p 27 Kip 1 accumulation, which inhibits cell cycle arrest essential for erythroid terminal differentiation...|$|R
40|$|The {{activation}} of the cHa-ras oncogene in the EJ/T 24 bladder carcinoma cell line was compared with the {{activation of}} the same gene in the rat-derived Harvey murine sarcoma virus. The results indicate that, like the human oncogene, the Harvey murine sarcoma virus-borne ras gene owes its oncogenic capacity to point mutations in coding sequences {{rather than to the}} alteration in transcriptional control that occurred when the formerly cellular ras sequences were acquired by the virus. The viral gene retained its transforming ability when its transcription was removed from the influence of the retroviral long terminal repeat promoter and was placed under the regulation of the cHa-ras promoter. Conversely, the viral long terminal repeat was insufficient to activate the normal cHa-ras allele when a single copy of such a construct was delivered to a cell by viral infection. In addition to their mode of activation, the biological properties of the EJ/T 24 and Harvey murine sarcoma virus oncogenes were compared by infecting newborn mice with chimeric retroviruses bearing each form. The two alleles acted equivalently, causing <b>erythroleukemias</b> and sarcomas with similar kinetics...|$|R

40|$|Aberrant {{expression}} of PU. 1 inhibits erythroid cell differentiation {{and contributes to}} the formation of murine <b>erythroleukemias</b> (MEL). The molecular mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood. Here we show that PU. 1 specifically and efficiently inhibits CBP-mediated acetylation of several nuclear proteins, including the hematopoietic transcription factors GATA- 1, NF-E 2, and erythroid Kr√ºppel-like factor. In addition, PU. 1 blocks acetylation of histones and interferes with acetylation-dependent transcriptional events. CBP acetyltransferase activity increases during MEL cell differentiation as PU. 1 levels decline and is inhibited by sustained PU. 1 expression. Finally, PU. 1 inhibits the differentiation-associated increase in histone acety-lation at an erythroid-specific gene locus in vivo. Together, these findings suggest that aberrant {{expression of}} PU. 1 and possibly other members of the Ets family of oncoproteins subverts normal cellular differentiation in part by inhibiting the acetylation of critical nuclear factors involved in balancing cellular proliferation and maturation. Cellular transformation can result from deregulated expres-sion of nuclear transcription factors. The Ets family oncopro-tein PU. 1 (Spi- 1) is normally expressed in myeloid and lym-phoid cells.

40|$|Avian c-erbB encodes {{a protein}} that is {{homologous}} {{to the human}} epidermal growth factor receptor. Truncation of the amino-terminal, ligand-binding domain of this receptor results in an oncogene product which is a potent inducing agent for <b>erythroleukemias</b> but not fibrosarcomas in chickens. Here we show that mutation of a single tyrosine residue, p 5, in the carboxyl terminus of the erbB oncogene product allows it to become sarcomagenic in vivo and to transform fibroblasts in vitro. Mutations of other autophosphorylation sites do not generate comparable effects. The increased transforming activity of the p 5 mutant is accompanied by an elevated level of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. By analogy to the human epidermal growth factor receptor, p 5 is a minor autophosphorylation site and {{is located in a}} domain known to be involved in regulating calcium influx and receptor internalization (CAIN domain). This area of the erbB product {{has been found to be}} repeatedly deleted in various sarcomagenic avian erythroblastosis virus isolates. We precisely deleted the CAIN domain and also made point mutations of the acidic residues within the CAIN domain. In both cases, fibroblast-transforming potential is activated. We interpret these data to mean that p 5 and its surrounding region negatively regulate fibroblast-transforming and sarcomagenic potential. To our knowledge, this represents the first point mutation of an autophosphorylation site that activates erbB oncogenicity...|$|R
40|$|BALB- and Harvey-murine sarcoma viruses (MSV) {{comprise}} {{a family of}} retroviruses whose mouse- and rat-derived onc genes are closely related. These viruses induce sarcomas and <b>erythroleukemias</b> in susceptible animals. An in vitro colony assay that detects transformation of lymphoid cells by Abelson-murine leukemia virus was used to demonstrate that BALB- and Harvey-MSV transform a novel hematopoietic cell both in culture and in vivo. Bone marrow colony formation was sarcoma virus dependent, followed single-hit kinetics, and required the presence of mercaptoethanol in the agar medium. BALB- and Harvey-MSV-induced colonies could be established in culture as continuous cell lines that demonstrated unrestricted self-renewal capacity and leukemogenicity in vivo. The cells had a blast cell morphology and lacked detectable markers of mature cells within the myeloid or erythroid series. They also lacked detectable immunoglobulin mu chain or Thy- 1 antigen, markers normally associated with committed cells of the B and T lymphoid lineages, respectively. However, the transformants contained very high levels of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), an enzyme believed to be specific to early stages within the lymphoid differentiation pathway. This phenotype distinguishes these BALB- and Harvey-MSV transformants from any previously reported hematopoietic targets of transforming retroviruses, including the pre-B lymphoid cell transformed by Abelson-MuLV under identical assay conditions. These newly identified lymphoid progenitor cell transformants may provide an important means of studying early stages of lymphoid ontogeny and the possible role of TdT in lymphoid development...|$|R

40|$|A {{colinear}} molecular clone of the Lilly-Steeves polycythemia {{strain of}} Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) was modified by inserting a 215 -base-pair tag of simian virus 40 DNA into its nonfunctional pol gene region. The DNA was then transfected into psi- 2 packaging cells, and helper-free tagged SFFV was recovered {{in the culture}} medium. Injection of this helper-free virus into NIH/Swiss mice caused transient mild splenomegaly and formation of spleen foci at 9 to 10 days. Although {{the vast majority of}} infected erythroblast clones then differentiated and died out, rare cell clones that were present in only 20 to 30 % of the mice grew extensively by 26 to 33 days to form transplantable leukemias. The clonality of these leukemias was established by Southern blot analysis of their DNAs by using several restriction endonucleases and the simian virus 40 tag as a hybridization probe. All transplantable leukemias lacked helper virus contamination and contained a single tagged SFFV provirus that expressed the mitogenic env gene product gp 55. The SFFV proviruses in these leukemias also appeared to be integrated into a few tightly clustered sites in the cellular genome. Although the tagged SFFV caused polycythemia during the polyclonal early stage of erythroblastosis, growth of the helper-free clonal <b>erythroleukemias</b> caused severe anemia. These results suggest that a single SFFV can cause mitosis of erythroblasts, and that cell immortalization also occurs when the provirus integrates into a critical site in the host genome. We propose that mice with clonal-stage leukemia become anemic because the immortalizing proviral integrations interfere with the cellular commitment to differentiate...|$|R
40|$|Thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T 3) is a {{pleiotropic}} regulator of growth, differentiation {{and tissue}} homeostasis in higher organisms that acts through {{the control of}} target gene expression. Most, if not all, major T 3 actions are mediated by specific high affinity nuclear receptors (TR) which are encoded by two genes, THRA and THRB. Several TRŒ± and TRŒ≤ receptor isoforms are expressed. Abundant and contradictory literature exists {{on the relationship between}} circulating thyroid hormone levels, thyroid diseases and human cancer. In 1986, a connection between TR and cancer became evident when the chicken TRŒ± 1 was characterized as the c-erbA proto-oncogene, the cellular counterpart of the retroviral v-erbA oncogene. V-erbA causes <b>erythroleukemias</b> and sarcomas in birds, and hepatocellular carcinomas in transgenic mice. In recent years, many studies have analyzed the presence of quantitative (abnormal levels) or qualitative (mutations) alterations in the expression of THR genes in different types of human neoplasias. While their role in tumor generation or progression is currently unclear, both gross chromosomal and minor mutations (deletions, aberrant splicing, point mutations) and changes in the level of expression of THRA and THRB genes have been found. Together with other in vitro data indicating connections between TR and p 53, Rb, cyclin D and other cell cycle regulators and oncogenes, these results suggest that THRA and THRB may be involved in human cancer. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the impact of the}} tyrosine kinase Lyn on erythropoietin-induced intracellular signaling in erythroid cells. In J 2 E erythroleukemic cells, Lyn coimmunoprecipitated with numerous proteins, including SHP- 1, SHP- 2, ras-GTPase-activating protein, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 5 a, STAT 5 b, and mitogen-activated protein kinase; however, introduction of a dominant-negative Lyn (Y 397 F Lyn) inhibited the interaction of Lyn with all of these molecules except SHP- 1. Cells containing the dominant-negative Lyn displayed altered intracellular phosphorylation patterns, including mitogen-actiated protein kinase, but not erythropoietin receptor, Janus-activated kinase (JAK) 2, or STAT 5. As a consequence, erythropoietin-initiated differentiation and basal proliferation were severely impaired. Y 397 F Lyn reduced the protein levels of erythroid transcription factors erythroid Kruppel-like factor and GATA- 1 up to 90 %, which accounts for the inability of J 2 E cells expressing Y 397 F Lyn to synthesize hemoglobin. Although Lyn was shown to bind several sites on the cytoplasmic domain of the erythropoietin receptor, it was not activated when a receptor mutated at the JAK 2 binding site was ectopically expressed in J 2 E cells indicating that JAK 2 is the primary kinase in erythropoietin signaling and that Lyn is a secondary kinase. In normal erythroid progenitors, erythropoietin enhanced phosphorylation of Lyn; moreover, exogenous Lyn increased colony forming unit-erythroid, but not burst forming uniterythroid, colonies from normal progenitors, demonstrating a stage-specific effect of the kinase. Significantly, altering Lyn activity in J 2 E cells {{had a profound effect on}} the development of <b>erythroleukemias</b> in vivo: the mortality rate was markedly reduced and latent period extended when either wild-type Lyn or Y 397 F Lyn was introduced into these cells. Taken together, these data show that Lyn plays an important role in intracellular signaling in nontransformed and leukemic erythroid cells...|$|R
50|$|The cytoplasmic {{domains of}} the EpoR contain {{a number of}} phosphotyrosines that are {{phosphorylated}} by Jak2 and serve as docking sites {{for a variety of}} intracellular pathway activators and Stats (such as Stat5).

In general, the defects in the erythropoietin receptor may produce <b>erythroleukemia</b> and familial erythrocytosis. Mutations in Jak2 kinases associated with EpoR can also lead to polycythemia vera.|$|E

50|$|The {{amount of}} {{expression}} of adiponectin {{has been observed}} {{to be related to}} diseases such as insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Decreased amounts of the protein indicates that there is a higher probability of receiving said diseases. Because the GSTK1 is seen {{to play a role in}} the multimerization of adiponectin, this enzyme can regulate the concentration of adiponectin and thus enhance insulin sensitivity and protect against diabetes. Also, the GSTK1 gene is unregulated when it is inflicted with oxidative stress and are over expressed in many tumors leading to difficulties during cancer chemotherapy. Moreover, GSTK1 gene expression has been seen to increase significantly in correlation to drug resistance in tumor cells such as <b>erythroleukemia</b> and mammary adenocarcinoma suggesting that it, along with GSTP1 and GSTA4, could be responsible for the drug resistance.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to Friend <b>erythroleukemia,</b> proviral integration at the fli-1 locus also occurs in leukemias {{induced by the}} 10A1, Graffi, and Cas-Br-E viruses. Fli-1 aberrant expression is also associated with chromosomal abnormalities in humans. In pediatric Ewing‚Äôs sarcoma a chromosomal translocation generates a fusion of the 5‚Äô transactivation domain of EWSR1 (also known as EWS) with the 3‚Äô Ets domain of Fli-1. The resulting fusion oncoprotein, EWS/Fli-1, acts as an aberrant transcriptional activator. with strong transforming capabilities. The importance of Fli-1 {{in the development of}} human leukemia, such as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), has been demonstrated in studies of translocation involving the Tel transcription factor, which interacts with Fli-1 through protein-protein interactions. A recent study has demonstrated high levels of Fli-1 expression in several benign and malignant neoplasms using immunohistochemistry.|$|E
50|$|Information on {{prognosis}} {{is limited by}} the rarity of the condition. Prognosis appears to be no different to AML in general, taking into account other risk factors. Acute erythroid leukemia (M6) has a relatively poor prognosis. A 2010 study of 124 patients found a median overall survival of 8 months. A 2009 study on 91 patients found a median overall survival for <b>erythroleukemia</b> patients of 36 weeks, with no statistically significant difference to other AML patients. AEL patients did have a significantly shorter disease free survival period, a median of 32 weeks, but this effect was explained by other prognostic factors. That is, AEL is often associated with other risk factors, like monosomal karyotypes and a history of myelodysplastic syndrome. Prognosis is worse in elderly patients, those with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome, and in patients who had previously received chemotherapy for the treatment of a different neoplasm.|$|E

A putative inhibitor of CYPJ2 also inhibited the growth of human K562 <b>erythroleukemia</b> in a mice model as well as the growth of mouse el4 lymphoma cells in mice that were forced to overexpress CYP2J2 cells in their vascular epithelium. Forced expression of CYP2J2 also enhanced, while forced inhibition of its expression (using Small interfering RNA) reduced, the survival, growth, and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells in the mouse model and likewise enhanced or reduced, respectively, the survival and growth of these cells in culture.

Double immunostaining with antibodies to band 3 in combination with spectrin or ankyrin revealed that these proteins become expressed synchronously during normal human erythropoiesis. In contrast, both murine <b>erythroleukemia</b> cells (induced by fibronectin and dimethyl sulfoxide to differentiate in vitro) and erythroblasts from a patient suffering from <b>erythroleukemia</b> displayed distinct asynchronicity in expression of these proteins, ie, ankyrin and spectrin were synthesized first, followed by band 3 at a later stage of erythroid development. After the onset of band 3 expression in human <b>erythroleukemia</b> cells, an increase of membrane-associated fluorescence was detectable for both ankyrin and spectrin, supporting the general view that band 3 promotes assembly of the membrane cytoskeleton.
