40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a general {{framework}} for learning distributed represen-tations of attributes: characteristics of text whose representations can be jointly learned with word embeddings. Attributes can correspond {{to a wide variety of}} concepts, such as <b>document</b> <b>indicators</b> (to learn sentence vectors), language in-dicators (to learn distributed language representations), meta-data and side infor-mation (such as the age, gender and industry of a blogger) or representations of authors. We describe a third-order model where word context and attribute vectors interact multiplicatively to predict the next word in a sequence. This leads to the notion of conditional word similarity: how meanings of words change when con-ditioned on different attributes. We perform several experimental tasks including sentiment classification, cross-lingual document classification, and blog author-ship attribution. We also qualitatively evaluate conditional word neighbours and attribute-conditioned text generation. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Social {{health is}} {{important}} to be assessed as a dimension of health. In this study we tried to determine areas and sub-areas of children social health indicators.   Methods: In a structured way, we reviewed the main social health databases and documents since 1995, both Iranian and international were reviewed to develop conceptual framework and to extract indicators.   Results: According to reviewed <b>documents,</b> <b>indicators</b> of social health were categorized into four groups. In first category indicators are related to system capacities such as facilities and institutions, financial, and human resources. Social system functions are classified as group two. The main subcategories of social health functions are policy development and enforcement, social marketing, community organizing, coalition building and collaboration, education, case management, screening, surveillance, and investigation. In group three, named as social factors, the main determined areas are life skills, early child development, family functioning, and social networks. Indicators related to social outcomes are categorized as group four. The main related positive social outcomes are social wellbeing and happiness and the main negative outcomes are physical health outcome (injuries, infectious diseases, etc.), mental health outcomes, development and learning outcomes, risky behaviors, academic outcomes, and legal outcomes.   Conclusion: Our recommended model develops a conceptual framework for child social health indicators. This framework and extracted indicators can be used to compare different populations to assess inequity for evidence based policy making and to implement proper interventions. </p...|$|R

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of randomly selected 500 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) attending 6 primary care diabetic clinics in the north Al-Batinah region of Oman from January to December 2010. Nine standards on {{the quality of}} diabetes care were audited. Results: The mean age of the sample was 51 ± 13 years, ranging from 15 to 87 years; the majority (61 %) were females. The mean duration of DM was 4 ± 3 years, ranging from 1 to 18 years. Seventy-seven percent of the patients attended diabetic clinics at least 4 times per year. Of the 9 assessed diabetic standards, HbA 1 c was documented in 33 % of the patients, body mass index in 12 %, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in 40 %, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio in 28 %, creatinine in 63 % and blood pressure (BP) in 96 %. Optimal control among the <b>documented</b> <b>indicators</b> was noted in 32, 21, 25, 85, 95 and 19 %, respectively. Twenty percent of the patients had their ECGs done while only 39 % of the patients had foot examination. No patient had attained control in all of HbA 1 c., BP and LDL-C.

40|$|Small and micro-enterprises play a {{significant}} part in most economies, whether developed or developing. However, in developing countries these enterprises {{have tended to be}} looked at from a development, or poverty alleviation perspective, rather than as entrepreneurial activities and potentially growing businesses. This paper presents {{the first step in a}} longitudinal study of a group of micro entrepreneurs in Mozambique from an entrepreneurship perspective rather than a development one. Mozambique lies along the Indian Ocean sea border of Southern Africa and is characterised by mountainous inland zones with a coastal plain. As a result of war and natural disasters over a prolonged period, there is little industry, primary industries are primitive and there is virtually no infrastructure. Mozambique is ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world. The purpose of this paper is to document the activities of a group of micro-entrepreneurs in Beira, in Central Mozambique, who received micro-financing to establish or grow their micro-enterprises and to examine these enterprises in terms of their potential for long term success. The first series of interviews with the entrepreneurs at their place of work has been conducted with a second round planned for later in 2006. This process itself offered many challenges, as did identifying the commonalities between enterprises in the developed world and enterprises entered into for largely survival reasons, that had no access to basic services such as electricity, running water, refrigeration and transport. Testing well <b>documented</b> <b>indicators</b> of success in this context highlights interesting differences and identifies others that may or may not be relevant in a different context...|$|R

Common periodontopathogenic bacteria could be isolated at both healthy and diseased implant sites [6], and the microbiological analysis of 40 species did not markedly differ by the clinical implant status (i.e., healthy, mucositis, peri-implantitis) [7]. However, a most recent analysis of 78 species has pointed to higher counts of 19 bacterial species at peri-implantitis - when compared with healthy implant sites, mainly including Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and Tannerella forsythia (T. forsythia) [4].|$|R
