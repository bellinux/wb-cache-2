Materials and Methods The extracts were prepared by Soxhlet method and were studied by disc diffusion, well <b>diffusion</b> and <b>tube</b> dillution <b>methods.</b> Results According to the disc diffusion and the well diffusion methods, no inhibitory zone have seen against investigated bacteria. The ethologic extract showed more inhibitory effect than the methanolic and aquatic extracts. The most sensitive bacterium to methanol extract was Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) equal to 6. 25 × 103 and 1. 25 × 104 respectively. The most sensitive bacteria to ethanol extract were Escherichia coli and Shigella dysenteriae with MIC and MBC equal to 6. 25 × 103 and 2. 5 × 104 respectively.

40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{investigated}} the diffusive sampler method for measuring NO 2 and SO 2 in ambient air. The two pollutants are either independently or simultaneously analysed using the diffusive sampler. Different types of diffusive samplers can be used e. g badge type, radial type or open-ended longitudinal <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes.</b> The Palmes tube, coated with triethanolamine (TEA), allows the simultaneous determination of NO 2 and SO 2. However, field measurements showed that the open-ended <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> is affected by a strong artefact on the SO 2 determination arising from sulphate particulate matter. To avoid this interference, a teflon membrane has been introduced at the open end of the Palmes tube able to prevent contamination coming from the particulate matter.

The perforated tubes enable air to diffuse throughout the absorbent uniformly which {{is crucial for}} the maximising reaction performance. The tubes overcome the issue of increased air resistance at the front surface of the material due to {{the thickness of the}} absorbent bed. This resistance can slow down the reaction kinetics whilst also causing a pressure drop which results in high fan energy consumption and low temperature lift. Similarly to the <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes,</b> perforated collector pipes are connected to the outlet side of the reactor. This allows the humid air to diffuse through the material and the hot air to be collected via outlet pipes. This concept increases the contact area of air and absorbent providing one possible solution to non-uniform HAM transfer in larger scale applications.|$|R

Finally, the sampler is placed in an air proof container and is ready to use in order {{to improve the quality of}} measurement. In order to evaluate the performance of the membrane-closed Palmes <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> to monitor nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), experiments were carried out in an exposure chamber. The relative effect of NO 2, temperature, humidity, averaging time and wind speed on the uptake rate of the sampler were then studied. Among the uncontrolled variables, temperature and humidity are found to be the most important ones leading to variability of the uptake rate. Two equations, used to estimate the uptake rate are established. These equations were then applied on some field data and laboratory inter-comparison tests. The agreement between the chemiluminescence method and diffusive samplers changes from 20 % of mean bias with the traditional Palmes <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes</b> to 5 % of mean bias with the membraneclosed Palmes tube (MCPT) at the same monitoring site. In the laboratory inter-comparison, the MCPT has shown to be able to correctly measure NO 2 under two extreme exposure conditions in contrast with other diffusive samplers.

Salvia officinalis and Mentha piperita are plants found abundantly {{in most parts of}} Iran. In the present study, we extracted and identified the chemical compounds of the essential oils of Salvia officinalis and Mentha piperita. Moreover, the anti-oxidative property, free radical scavenging capacity, and antimicrobial activities of the essential oils of these plants were studied. Materials & Methods: This study was conducted in the Biotechnology Department laboratories, Agricultural Faculty of Avicina University, Hamadan, Iran, in 2009. The aerial parts of Salvia officinalis and Mentha piperita were harvested in summer, when the plants were in their full blooming stage and dried in the shade. The essential oil of the aerial parts was extracted by hydro-distillation and was analyzed by capillary GC and GC/MS method. The micro-organisms employed in this study were: E. coli, S. aureus, S. enteritidis, L. monocytogenes. By employing disc <b>diffusion</b> and <b>tube</b> dilution <b>methods,</b> antimicrobial effects of the oils were studied. Antioxidative property, free radical scavenging capacity, and antimicrobial activities of the oils were also studied. Results: Chemical analysis of the extracts resulted in the identification of 28 and 37 compounds in the essential oils of Salvia officinalis and Mentha piperita respectively. The sensitivity of the bacteria to the oils in order of decreasing the sensitivity was L. monocytogenes, E. coli, S. aureus, and S. enteritidis. The antibacterial properties of the essential oil from Mentha piperita leaves were higher than the oil of Salvia officinalis leaves. Also inhibitions zones of microbial growth were not correlated with the microbicidal kinetics of the oils. Conclusion: This study showed that the herbal essences of Salvia officinalis and Mentha piperita are very active against E. coli, S. aureus, S. enteritidis and L. monocytogenes...|$|R

The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine antibacterial efficacy and antioxidant property brought about by essential oils from Matricaria chamomilla L. Disk <b>diffusion</b> and <b>tube</b> dilution <b>methods</b> were employed to evaluate inhibition, Minimal Inhibitory (MIC) and Minimal Bactericidal (MBC) concentrations and bactericidal kinetics of the oil. Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus sanguis were exposed to essential oils of Matricaria chamomilla L. The oil composition was analyzed by GC and GC/MS. Antioxidant activity was determined by Ã¢-carotene bleaching test. The oil from the above plant was found to be strongly antimicrobial. MICs/MBCs of Matricaria chamomilla L. oil determined for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus sanguis in terms of Ã¬g/ml were 0. 1 / 0. 2, 0. 5 / 1. 5, 0. 5 / 0. 8, 4 / 7 and 0. 5 / 1. 1, respectively.

40|$|Numerous passive {{samplers}} {{based on}} the ‘Palmes-tube’ {{have been developed for}} ambient air monitoring. In each case, the diffusion path length and/or crosssectional area are modified to achieve the desired sampling rate. ‘Tube-type’ samplers are low sensitivity samplers suitable for long-term monitoring, whereas the ‘badge-type’ samplers have faster sampling rates suited to short-term monitoring. In the U. K., <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes</b> are widely used for monitoring nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ammonia (NH 3). The open-ended <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes</b> are prone to positive bias caused by incursion of wind eddies, leading to a shortening of the diffusion path. By using a porous membrane at the inlet, wind incursion is prevented, but an additional diffusion resistance is imposed and it is necessary to calibrate the tubes against a reference method to obtain an effective sampling rate. For NO 2 sampling, positive bias also arises from the reaction of NO with O 3 within the sampler. The interference from the chemical reaction is severe close to NO sources, with errors up to 30 % for curbside locations when using the ‘tubetype’ sampler. In rural areas, where NO concentrations are small relative to NO 2, these errors are small. In some implementations, there is also a negative bias over long sampling periods caused by the degradation of trapped NO 2. The low sampling rates of <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes</b> make them too uncertain for use at background NH 3 concentrations (< 1 μg NH 3 m- 3) where they significantly overestimate concentrations. Badge-type samplers such as the ‘Willems badge’ samplers permit accurate sampling at low ambient NH 3 concentrations, but suffer from saturation at high concentrations and sensitivity to wind speed. A passive sampler optimised for monthly measurements of NH 3 is reported here, together with its application in the U. K. National Ammonia Monitoring Network...|$|R

The sensor is simple and inexpensive to fabricate, and determining atom density is straightforward. Sensor design also inhibits thermal runaway, which occurs when atom density is high enough to impart enough recombination energy to the non-catalytic surface to substantially raise its temperature. While recombination coefficients for such surfaces are very low near room temperature, they increase nearly exponentially with temperature unless actively cooled. With the use of a straightforward calibration scheme to determine the variation in species fraction along the <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube,</b> the atomic fraction at the tube opening is determined.

40|$|In {{this study}} (i) the {{accuracy}} of NO_ 2 <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> measurement and (ii) micro-scale variations in urban NO_ 2 formation are shown to be strongly influenced by prevailing O_ 3 concentrations, modified by site and season. The {{first part of the}} thesis is an evaluation of NO_ 2 <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes</b> for ambient measurement. A review of previous studies highlights uncertainties in sampler behaviour which are followed up by laboratory and field investigations. In the laboratory, the stability of triethanolamine absorbent for NO_ 2 collection is not impaired by low temperatures (down to - 10 deg C) or by long-term exposure (up to 42 days). Extensive field trials at a site in Cambridge compare NO_ 2 measurements by <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes</b> to the alternative chemiluminescence technique to determine (i) precision and accuracy, (ii) effects of exposure length and (iii) origin of a systematic positive bias. A 22 -month study confirms a positive bias in NO_ 2 measurement, for 2 -week exposures, of 16 %. The bias increases to 24 % for concurrent 1 -week exposures and decreases to 6 % for 4 -week exposures. These results indicate the presence of two opposing systematic biases, a time-independent overestimation and a time-dependent reduction in NO_ 2. The nature of the overestimation is investigated further using sets of acrylic and quartz samplers, of a range of lengths, at three different urban locations. Results strongly support a chemical overestimation, due to absorption of UV radiation by the acrylic tube walls preventing NO_ 2 photolysis within the tube. Excess NO_ 2, formed from the fast reaction of NO and O_ 3, accumulates at the absorbent. Furthermore, for standard length samplers, no evidence is found for enhancement of NO_ 2 by wind-driven turbulence {{at the mouth of the}} tube. The magnitude of the overestimation varies both within and between different locations because of short-term variability in NO, NO_ 2 and O_ 3 concentrations. NO_ 2 measurements by <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes</b> cannot readily be corrected and the implications of this study for their use as ambient NO_ 2 monitors is discussed. In the second part of the thesis, relationships between NO_ 2, NO_x and O_ 3 are explored using concurrent hourly mean measurements from an automated monitoring site in Cambridge. A significant new model is developed using Principal Component Analysis. Principal components are extracted which have clear associations with underlying chemistry. The model provides insight into the behaviour of the photostationary state system, perturbed by changing pollutant concentrations. Important features of this perturbation are demonstrated; the exceptional impact of the seasons on the diurnal cycle and the outcome of this for NO_ 2 and O_ 3 levels. The ability of the model to describe differences in photochemical behaviour due to location and proximity to emission sources is explored for other sites in the UK (using national archive data from the Internet). The limitations of the model are discussed and future developments suggested.
