500|$|Mike Masnick {{wrote about}} the case on Techdirt, commenting {{on the effect of}} Beck's actions on the meme's spread. He {{observed}} in retrospect it would have been advantageous for Beck to have simply done nothing rather than encourage the meme as a byproduct of his attempts to remove it from the Internet. Masnick pointed out that Beck's actions provided legitimacy to the meme's noteworthiness. Steffen Schmidt wrote of Beck's predicament in a Des Moines Register article: [...] "Mr. Beck has quite a task ahead of him. Shutting down one web site <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> to eradicate Pueraria lobata the dreaded Kudzu vine that is eating the South." [...] Citizen Media Law Project observed Beck had exacerbated the situation by intimating legal tactics against Eiland-Hall, which served to increase the popularity of the meme and coverage of it among blogs.|$|E
500|$|The album {{concludes with}} a long guitar instrumental, [...] "Watermelon in Easter Hay", the only guitar solo {{recorded}} for the album, in 9/4 time; every other guitar solo on the album was xenochronous—overdubbed from older live recordings. [...] In their review of the album, Down Beat magazine criticized the song, but subsequent reviewers have championed the song as Zappa's masterpiece. [...] Lowe called it the [...] "crowning achievement of the album" [...] and [...] "one of the most gorgeous pieces of music ever produced". [...] Zappa told Neil Slaven that {{he thought it was}} [...] "the best song on the album". The songs' title is thought to have come from a saying used by Zappa while recording the album: [...] "Playing a guitar solo with this band <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> to grow watermelon in Easter hay". After Zappa died, [...] "Watermelon in Easter Hay" [...] became known as one of his signature songs, and his son, Dweezil Zappa, later referred to it as [...] "the best solo Zappa ever played".|$|E

He is known for his criticism of the many studies that look at same gender parenting. He suggests that the American Psychological Association is wrong for citing studies with less than 100 participants. Marks pre-released his study in order for it to be included in Hollingsworth v. Perry, and though he was scheduled to testify in favor of California's Proposition 8, he was not called. Marks testified on March 5, 2014 and criticized a 2005 American Psychological Association study that found {{there was no difference in}} the outcomes of children raised by gay and lesbian parents. He said the studies the APA used to frame its report did not include enough heterosexual couples and there were too few gay fathers represented. Under cross-examination by attorney Carole Stanyar, the co-counsel for the DeBoer-Rowse family, Marks admitted that finding a large enough sample to study gay and lesbian parents <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> to find a [...] "." [...] Marks also testified under cross-examination that he is [...] "not in favor of redefining marriage at present" [...] but “neutral” on whether there is a difference in outcomes for children raised by gay couples.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the fall}} of 1986, roughly 100 PBS {{stations}} carried The Mechanical Universe, and by {{the fall of}} 1987, over 600 higher-education institutions had purchased it or licensed the episodes for use. In 1992, Goodstein noted that the series had been broadcast, via PBS, by over 100 stations, [...] "usually at peculiar hours when innocent people were unlikely to tune in accidentally on a differential equation in the act of being solved". He observed that detailed viewership figures were difficult to obtain, but when the show had been broadcast in Miami during Saturday mornings, the producers were able to obtain Nielsen ratings.In fact, it came in second in its time slot, beating the kiddie cartoons on two network stations. There were 18,000 faithful core households in Dade County alone, the median age of the viewers was 18, and half were female. However, we seldom get that kind of detailed information.Goodstein and assistant project director Richard Olenick noted,Anecdotal information in the form of letters and phone calls indicates very considerable enthusiasm among users at all levels from casual viewers to high-school students to research university professors, but there have also been a number of sharp disappointments, particularly when Instructional Television administrators have tried to handle TMU like a conventional telecourse.Similarly, a 1988 review in Physics Today suggested that the programs would not function well on their own as a telecourse, but would work much better as a supplement to a traditional classroom or a more standard distance-learning course such as Open University. The reviewers also found the [...] "algebraic ballet" [...] of computer-animated equations too fast to follow: [...] "After a short time, one yearns for a live professor filling the blackboard with equations". Similarly, a review in the American Journal of Physics, while praising the [...] "technical proficiency of the films", wrote of the animated equation manipulations, [...] "As the MIT students say, this <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> to take a drink of water out of a fire hose". A considerably more enthusiastic evaluation came from physicist Charles H. Holbrow, who told Olenick, [...] "These materials will constitute the principal visual image of physics for decades". Goodstein and Olenick reported that younger viewers tended to enjoy the [...] "algebraic ballet" [...] style [...] "much more than older viewers, who are made uncomfortable by the algebraic manipulations they cannot quite follow".|$|E

And he pleaded ever so urgently, ever so finely, that what we all knew for Sin was sinful, and on the whole best avoided altogether, and so went on with deepening notes and even with short arresting gestures of the right arm and hand, to stir and exhort us towards goodness, towards that modern, unsectarian goodness, goodness in general and nothing in particular, which the Zeitgeist seemed to indicate in those transitional years.|$|E
6000|$|THE QUALITY OF HOLMES. The {{intensely}} personal {{quality of}} the works just mentioned is their most striking characteristic; for Holmes always looks at a subject with his own eyes, and measures {{its effect on the}} reader by a previous effect produced upon himself. [...] "If I like this," [...] he says in substance, [...] "why, you must like it too; if it strikes me as absurd, you cannot take any other attitude; for are we not both human and therefore just alike?" [...] It never occurred to Holmes that anybody could differ with him and still be normal; those who ventured to do so found the Doctor looking keenly at them to discover their symptoms. In an ordinary egoist or politician or theologian this would be insufferable; but strange to say {{it is one of the}} charms of Holmes, who is so witty and pleasant-spoken that we can enjoy his dogmatism without the bother of objecting to it. In one of his books he hints that talking to certain persons <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> to pet a squirrel; if you are wise, you will not imitate that frisky little beast but assume the purring-kitten attitude while listening to the Autocrat.|$|E

60|$|Yet, {{while the}} men's talk {{was so good}} and new, their written word seemed to be cast in conventional, not to say old-fashioned, moulds. A {{quarter of a century}} ago a sub-editor, opening his mail, could {{identify}} the Melbourne Argus, the Sydney Morning Herald, or the Cape Times {{as far as he could}} see them. Even unheaded clippings from them declared their origin as a piece of hide betrays the beast that wore it. But he noticed then that Canadian journals left neither spoor nor scent--might have blown in from anywhere between thirty degrees of latitude--and had to be carefully identified by hand. To-day, the spacing, the headlines, the advertising of Canadian papers, the chessboard-like look of the open page which should be a daily beautiful study in black and white, the brittle pulp-paper, the machine-set type, are all as standardised as the railway cars of the Continent. Indeed, looking through a mass of Canadian journals <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> to find one's own sleeper in a corridor train.

Robina would do the cooking. Robina would rise early and milk the cow, and gather the morning egg. We would lead the simple life, learn to fend for ourselves. It would be so good for Veronica. The higher {{education}} could wait; let the higher ideals have a chance. Veronica would make the beds, dust the rooms. In the evening Veronica, her little basket by her side, would sit and sew while I talked, telling them things, and Robina moved softly to and fro about her work, the household fairy. The Little Mother, whenever strong enough, would come to us. We would hover round her, tending her with loving hands. The English farmer must know something, in spite of all that is said. Dick could arrange for lessons in practical farming. She did not say it crudely; but hinted that, surrounded by example, even I might come to take an interest in honest labour, might end by learning to do something useful.|$|E
60|$|If she {{had been}} only a {{beautiful}} girl in love with me, I think I could have managed the situation. Once or twice since my marriage and before Isabel became of any significance in my life, there had been incidents with other people, flashes of temptation--no telling is possible of the thing resisted. I think that mere beauty and passion would not have taken me. But between myself and Isabel things were incurably complicated by the intellectual sympathy we had, the jolly march of our minds together. That has always mattered enormously. I should have wanted her company nearly as badly if {{she had been}} some crippled old lady; we would have hunted shoulder to shoulder, as two men. Only two men would never have had the patience and readiness for one another we two had. I had never for years met any one with whom I could be so carelessly sure of understanding or to whom I could listen so easily and fully. She gave me, with an extraordinary completeness, that rare, precious effect of always saying something fresh, and yet saying it so that it filled into and folded about all the little recesses and corners of my mind with an infinite, soft familiarity.
