5|$|In June 2010, it was {{reported}} that plans were made to create a film titled Die Hard 24/7, which would serve as a crossover between 24 and the Die Hard franchise, with Sutherland to reprise his role as Jack Bauer alongside Bruce Willis' John McClane. However, these plans never came to fruition, with the studio instead opting to create the film A <b>Good</b> <b>Day</b> <b>to</b> Die Hard.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the prior}} three {{films in the}} series, the U.S. rating was PG-13 rather than R. An unrated version {{contained}} more strong profanity and violence not shown in the theatrical version, and {{was included in the}} DVD release. For the DVD release, 20th Century Fox pioneered a new kind of DRM, Digital Copy protection that tries to weaken the incentives for consumers to learn how to rip discs by offering them a downloadable version with studio-imposed restrictions. The score for the film was released on July 2, 2007. The fifth film in the series, titled A <b>Good</b> <b>Day</b> <b>to</b> Die Hard, was released on February 14, 2013.|$|E

500|$|Willis reprised {{his most}} famous role, John McClane, for a fifth time, {{starring}} in A <b>Good</b> <b>Day</b> <b>to</b> Die Hard, which was released on February 14, 2013. In an interview, Willis said, [...] "I have a warm spot in my heart for Die Hard..... it's just the sheer novelty {{of being able to}} play the same character over 25 years and still be asked back is fun. It's much more challenging to have to do a film again and try to compete with myself, which is what I do in Die Hard. I try to improve my work every time." ...|$|E
500|$|Charlie Collier, the {{president}} of AMC, stated that it was [...] "a <b>good</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> be dead. We are so proud of this series, its depth of storytelling and the remarkable talent attached. As the network dedicated to bringing viewers the best stories on television, we are so pleased {{to have the opportunity}} with The Walking Dead to raise the bar within this popular genre and continue our commitment to being the home of premium television on basic cable." [...] Senior Vice President Joel Stillerman ascribed that much of its success came from the storytelling presented in the episode; [...] "The Walking Dead is that rare piece of programming that works on so many levels. It is legitimately great storytelling that is not only highly entertaining, but incredibly thought provoking as well. People who are familiar with the comic books know what's coming, but suffice it to say, this is only the beginning of a long, intense, and powerful ride. Long live The Walking Dead." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hunkpapa warriors led by Chief Gall led {{the main}} body of the attack. Crazy Horse's {{tactical}} and leadership role in the battle remains ambiguous. While some historians think that Crazy Horse led a flanking assault, ensuring the death of Custer and his men, the only proven fact is that Crazy Horse was a major participant in the battle. His personal courage was attested to by several eye-witness Indian accounts. Water Man, one of only five Arapaho warriors who fought, said Crazy Horse [...] "was the bravest man I ever saw. He rode closest to the soldiers, yelling to his warriors. All the soldiers were shooting at him, but he was never hit." [...] Sioux battle participant, Little Soldier, said, [...] "The greatest fighter in the whole battle was Crazy Horse." [...] Crazy Horse is said to have exhorted his warriors before the fight with the battle cry [...] "Hóka-héy! Today is a <b>good</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> die!" [...] but the quotation is inaccurately attributed. The earliest published reference is from 1881, in which the phrase is attributed to Low Dog. The English version is not an accurate translation from the Lakota language, [...] "Hóka-héy!" [...] Both phrases are used in context by Black Elk in Black Elk Speaks.|$|E

50|$|In 1978, {{the first}} {{significant}} host changes took place on <b>Good</b> <b>Day!.</b> Janet Langhart left the show in June of that year, as she accepted NBC's offer to be the New York-based co-host on the network's new daytime talk show America Alive!. In searching for Langhart's replacement, the producers of <b>Good</b> <b>Day!</b> decided <b>to</b> hire John Willis' former co-host from WTTG-TV's Panorama series, Meryl Comer. There was much promotional fanfare of the pairing of Willis and Comer; despite solid chemistry on-screen between the two longtime friends and colleagues, ratings for <b>Good</b> <b>Day!</b> began <b>to</b> decline in the 1978-79 season. After one year as co-host, Comer returned to the Washington, DC market.|$|R
