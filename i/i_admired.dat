That meeting with Viñes was paramount in my life: I owe him everything... In reality it is to Viñes that I owe my fledgling efforts in music and everything I know about the piano.|$|E

He died on 28 September 2012, following {{a long period of}} illness. Among those to pay tribute were U.S. country singer Robert Mizzell who said: “I am so saddened to hear of the passing of country legend Larry. <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> his talent and quick humour. My thoughts are with his family, friends, and the fans who loved the big deep voice that rattled the radio waves”.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Hall's {{cinematography}} and {{the thematic}} use of water.

As she told the writer Gloria Steinem during the 1968 presidential campaign, [...] "I never had time to think about things like that—who I wanted to be, or who <b>I</b> <b>admired,</b> or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work." ...|$|E
500|$|Glazunov and Lyadov were {{friendly}} with Tchaikovsky and were charmed by him. Glazunov studied Tchaikovsky's works and [...] "found much that was new... that was instructive {{for us as}} young musicians. It struck me that Tchaikovsky, who was above all a lyrical and melodic composer, had introduced operatic elements into his symphonies. <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> the thematic material of his works less than the inspired unfolding of his thoughts, his temperament and the constructural perfection." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilbert {{was mostly}} {{collaborative}} with Dahl's work, as the writer declared: [...] "He not only helped in script conferences, but {{had some good}} ideas and then left you alone, and when you produced the finished thing, he shot it. Other directors have such an ego {{that they want to}} rewrite it and put their own dialogue in, and it's usually disastrous. What <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> so much about Lewis Gilbert was that he just took the screenplay and shot it. That's the way to direct: You either trust your writer or you don't." ...|$|E

I think it's time {{for that kind of}} glamor to come back. In pop music generally, people have one image. You get pigeonholed. I'm lucky {{enough to be able to}} change and still be accepted. If you think about it, that's what they do in the movies; play a part, change characters, looks and attitudes. I guess I do it to entertain myself." ...|$|E
500|$|After Speaker's death, Cobb said, [...] "Terribly depressed. I {{never let}} him know how much <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> him when we were playing against each other... It was only after we finally became {{teammates}} and then retired that I could tell Tris Speaker of the underlying respect I had for him." [...] Lajoie said, [...] "He {{was one of the}} greatest fellows I ever knew, both as a baseball player and as a gentleman." [...] Former Boston teammate Duffy Lewis said, [...] "He was a team player. As great a hitter as he was, he wasn't looking out for his own average ... Speaker was the bell cow of our outfield. Harry Hooper and I would watch him and know how to play the hitters." ...|$|E
500|$|Tynan {{remarked to}} Olivier, [...] "you aren't really a contemplative or {{philosophical}} actor"; Olivier {{was known for}} the strenuous physicality of his performances in some roles. He told Tynan this {{was because he was}} influenced as a young man by Douglas Fairbanks, Ramon Navarro and John Barrymore in films, and Barrymore on stage as Hamlet: [...] "tremendously athletic. <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> that greatly, all of us did.... One thought of oneself, idiotically, skinny as I was, as a sort of Tarzan." [...] According to Morley, Gielgud was widely considered [...] "the best actor in the world from the neck up and Olivier from the neck down." [...] Olivier described the contrast thus: [...] "I've always thought that we were the reverses of the same coin... the top half John, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity." ...|$|E

In 2000, he was inducted in Don Garlits' International Drag Racing Hall of Fame. Hill {{was inducted into}} the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2002. After he was notified of his nomination, he said [...] "It's so much more satisfying to get this award now than posthumously. This way I'll be able to enjoy it.

500|$|Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave Captain America: The First Avenger a {{positive}} review, saying, [...] "Johnston has delivered a light, clever and deftly balanced adventure picture with real lump {{in the throat}} nostalgia, with Nazis – who make the best villains, and with loving references to Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times remarked, [...] "I enjoyed the movie. I appreciated the 1940s period settings and costumes, which were a break with the usual generic cityscapes. <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> the way that director Joe Johnston propelled the narrative. I {{got a sense of}} a broad story, rather than the impression of a series of sensational set pieces. If Marvel is wise, it will take this and Iron Man as its templates". A. O. Scott of The New York Times declared it [...] "pretty good fun".|$|E
500|$|Her family made a {{down payment}} on their own home in Humboldt Park, a {{predominantly}} Puerto Rican neighborhood on Chicago's West Side when she was eleven years old. This neighborhood and its characters would later become the inspiration for Cisneros's novel The House on Mango Street. For high school, Cisneros attended Josephinum Academy, a small Catholic all-girls school. Here she found an ally in a high-school teacher who helped her to write poems about the Vietnam War. Although Cisneros had written her first poem around the age of ten, with her teacher's encouragement she became known for her writing throughout her high-school years. In high school she wrote poetry and was the literary magazine editor, but, according to herself, she did not really start writing until her first creative writing class in college in 1974. After that it took a while to find her own voice. She explains, [...] "I rejected what was at hand and emulated the voices of the poets <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> in books: big male voices like James Wright and Richard Hugo and Theodore Roethke, all wrong for me." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{turn of the}} 20th century saw {{a rise in the}} {{popularity}} of Fauré's music in Britain, {{and to a lesser extent}} in Germany, Spain and Russia. He visited England frequently, and an invitation to play at Buckingham Palace in 1908 opened many other doors in London and beyond. He attended the London premiere of Elgar's First Symphony, in 1908, and dined with the composer afterwards. Elgar later wrote to their mutual friend Frank Schuster that Fauré [...] "was such a real gentleman– the highest kind of Frenchman and <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> him greatly." [...] Elgar tried to get Fauré's Requiem put on at the Three Choirs Festival, but it did not finally have its English premiere until 1937, nearly fifty years after its first performance in France. Composers from other countries also loved and admired Fauré. In the 1880s Tchaikovsky had thought him [...] "adorable"; Albéniz and Fauré were friends and correspondents until the former's early death in 1909; Richard Strauss sought his advice; and in Fauré's last years, the young American, Aaron Copland was a devoted admirer.|$|E
500|$|In February 1925, Barrymore staged Hamlet in London at the Haymarket Theatre, {{which the}} Manchester Guardian later said had [...] "the most memorable first night for years". The reviews were positive, and [...] "although {{none of the}} London critics found Barrymore {{superior}} to [...] Irving and [...] Forbes-Robertson, many were favorable in their comparisons". Among the audience members was the 20-year-old actor John Gielgud, who wrote in his program [...] "Barrymore is romantic in appearance and naturally gifted with grace, looks and a capacity to wear period clothes, which makes his brilliantly intellectual performance classical without being unduly severe, and he has tenderness, remoteness, and neurosis all placed with great delicacy and used with immense effectiveness and admirable judgment". Looking back in the 1970s, he said: [...] "The handsome middle-aged stars of the Edwardian theatre romanticised the part. Even John Barrymore, whose Hamlet <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> very much, cut the play outrageously so that he could, for instance, play the closet scene all out for sentiment {{with the emphasis on}} the 'Oedipus complex'– sobbing on Gertrude's bosom. Yet Barrymore... had a wonderful edge and a demonic sense of humour." ...|$|E
500|$|President Obama said {{upon her}} death that [...] "Geraldine {{will forever be}} remembered as a {{trailblazer}} who broke down barriers for women, and Americans of all backgrounds and walks of life," [...] and said that his own two daughters would grow up in a more equal country because of what Ferraro had done. Mondale called her [...] "a remarkable woman and a dear human being... She was a pioneer in our country for justice for women and a more open society. She broke a lot of molds and it's a better country for what she did." [...] George H. W. Bush said, [...] "Though we were one-time political opponents, I am happy to say Gerry and I became friends in time – a friendship marked by respect and affection. <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> Gerry in many ways, {{not the least of which}} was the dignified and principled manner she blazed new trails for women in politics." [...] Palin paid tribute to her on Facebook, expressing gratitude for having been able to work with her the year before and saying, [...] "She broke one huge barrier and then went on to break many more. May her example of hard work and dedication to America continue to inspire all women." [...] Bill and Hillary Clinton said in a statement that, [...] "Gerry Ferraro was one of a kind – tough, brilliant, and never afraid to speak her mind or stand up for what she believed in – a New York icon and a true American original." ...|$|E

500|$|Janet Maslin, {{reviewing}} for The New York Times, praised Fincher's {{direction and}} editing of the film. She wrote that Fight Club carried {{a message of}} [...] "contemporary manhood", and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism. Roger Ebert, reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Times, called Fight Club [...] "visceral and hard-edged", but also [...] "a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy", whose promising first act {{is followed by a}} second that panders to macho sensibilities and a third he dismissed as [...] "trickery". Ebert later acknowledged that the film was [...] "beloved by most, not by me". He was later requested to have a shot-by-shot analysis of Fight Club at the Conference on World Affairs; he stated that [...] "eeing it {{over the course of a}} week, <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> its skill even more, and its thought even less." [...] Jay Carr of The Boston Globe opined that the film began with an [...] "invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz", but that it eventually became [...] "explosively silly". Newsweeks David Ansen described Fight Club as [...] "an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload" [...] and thought that the ending was too pretentious. Richard Schickel of Time described the director's mise en scène as dark and damp: [...] "It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it's polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it's carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it's better to be wet than dry." [...] Schickel applauded the performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, but he criticized the film's [...] "conventionally gimmicky" [...] unfolding and the failure to make Helena Bonham Carter's character interesting.|$|E
2500|$|The initial title, Ruddygore, was changed: {{because of}} claims that [...] "ruddy" [...] was too {{similar to the}} then-taboo curse word [...] "bloody", it was shortly changed to Ruddigore.

Only a year had passed since then. But in the meantime I had come to realise that <b>I</b> <b>admired</b> JatinDa because he personified, perhaps without himself knowing it, the best of mankind. The corollary to that realisation was that Jatinda's death would be avenged if I worked for the ideal of establishing a social order in which the best in man could be manifest." ...|$|E
