500|$|The game's soundtrack {{was entirely}} {{composed}} by Fox. A self-taught musician, he composed {{most of the}} tracks with little iteration; the game's main theme, [...] "Undertale", was the only song to undergo multiple iterations in development. The soundtrack was inspired by music from Super NES role-playing games, such as EarthBound, {{as well as the}} webcomic Homestuck, for which Fox provided some of the music. Fox also stated that he tries to be inspired by all music <b>he</b> <b>listens</b> to, particularly those in video games. According to Fox, over 90% of the songs were composed specifically for the game. [...] "Megalovania", the song used during the boss battle with Sans, had previously been used within Homestuck and in one of Fox's EarthBound ROM hacks. For each section of the game, Fox composed the music prior to programming, as it helped [...] "decide how the scene should go". He initially tried using a music tracker to compose the soundtrack, but found it difficult to use. He ultimately decided to play segments of the music separately, and connect them on a track. To celebrate the one year anniversary of the game, Fox released five unused musical works on his blog in 2016.|$|E

Seeing God's meaning, Joan finally returns to Evan with new-found faith and continues helping him finish the ark together in order to prepare for the flood. On September 22, the day of the flood, Evan's staffers arrive in support as well and Eugene shows him research he performed on Long. It is revealed that, many years ago, Long conquered Prestige Crest and later commissioned a dam, then destroyed the remaining land to have many of the lots and houses built.
