25|$|Due to Australia's large size, sparse population, and {{relative}} remoteness to other countries, {{a significant amount}} of infrastructure is required for Internet communications. The vast majority of Australia's international Internet transit capacity is sourced from undersea fibre-optic communications cables to Asia and the US. Until 2009 data costs across the Pacific were constrained by a Telstra–Telecom duopoly on the available cables. The provision of PPC-1 cable in 2009 broke this duopoly and caused the cost of data transmission to fall substantially. Since then Australia has enjoyed North American standards of internet access, with many ISPs providing plans with unlimited <b>high-speed</b> <b>access.</b>|$|E
