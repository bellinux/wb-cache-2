40|$|A 36 -year-old {{young male}} with {{multiple}} heterosexual contacts presented with bilateral <b>inguinal</b> <b>bubo</b> and the classical "sign of groove". A diagnosis of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) {{was made and}} a three-week course of doxycycline was given. Lack of response prompted us to investigate further. A biopsy of the bubo was consistent with non-Hodgkin&#x 2032;s lymphoma (NHL). Immunohistochemistry of the lymph node done at the Regional Cancer Center (RCC), Trivandrum, confirmed the diagnosis as NHL of diffuse large B-cell type. The second patient, a 32 -year-old male with two unprotected heterosexual contacts presented with a left-sided <b>inguinal</b> <b>bubo</b> of six weeks duration. An empirical course of doxycycline was given even though investigations did not reveal any STI. Lack of response prompted us to do a lymph node biopsy, which was consistent with NHL, which later with immunohistochemistry was confirmed as NHL, diffuse large cell type. We are reporting here that the "sign of groove" is not specific for LGV as thought earlier, but can occur in NHL also...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{report a}} case of an <b>inguinal</b> <b>bubo</b> in a young man caused by an anaerobe, Prevotella bivia, which was {{acquired}} during oral sexual intercourse. As far as the authors know, {{this is the first}} reported case of a sexually transmitted infection by Prevotella. Prevotella spp. inhabit the oral cavity and are highly prevalent in bacterial vaginosis, a polymicrobial syndrome resulting from replacement of the normal vaginal Lactobacillus spp. flora by high concentrations of anaerobic microorganisms such as Prevotella spp., Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and other uncultivated anaerobes. CASE REPORT A 34 -year-old man presented to our department with a 5 -day history of a painful mass in the left groin (figure 1). He had been treated with cipro-floxacin and doxycycline for 3 days without any improvement. His past medical record was unre-markable without any previous sexually trans-mitted infection (STI) or genital ulcer, but he reported unprotected sexual intercourse with a woman 48 h prior to the appearance of the symptoms. Physical examination revealed an erythematous, warm, tender and fluctuant mass, 532 cm in diameter, in the left inguinal area. This mass was extremely painful on palpation. No genital, anal or perianal ulcers were observed, and no associated urethral symptoms were present. A detailed exam of the penis and scrotum was also normal. Inguinal ultrasound studies showed a hypoechoic subcutaneous mass and ruled out testicular or epididimal abnormalities. An abdominalepelvic CT scan disclosed several enlarged lymph nodes at the left inguinal region (figure 2), one of them showing fistulisation to the subcutaneous tissue. No other abdominal masses were detected. Serological testing for syphilis (treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR)), HIV and Chlamydia tracho-matis was negative. Since antibiotic treatment had proven unsuccessful, incision and drainage were performed. The foul-smelling purulent exudate obtained was tested for C trachomatis by real tim...|$|E
40|$|One-hundred {{thirteen}} men (mean age, 23 years) {{who presented}} with <b>inguinal</b> <b>buboes</b> to a government-operated hospital for {{sexually transmitted diseases}} (STDs) in Bangkok were studied between February 1987 and February 1989. The median duration of preceding symptoms was 7 days (range, 1 - 62 days). The majority of patients (74; 65 %) had received treatment previously; 31 (27 %) were febrile, 13 (12 %) had extrainguinal lymphadenopathy, and 31 (27 %) had concurrent active genital ulcers. There was no history of genital ulceration in 66 (58 %) of the patients. Pus was obtained from 51 of the 110 buboes aspirated for culture; 21 (41 %) of these cultures yielded Haemophilus ducreyi, and 2 (3. 9 %) were positive for Chlamydia trachomatis on immunofluorescence microscopy. Saline (1 mL) was injected and reaspirated from the buboes of 35 of the other 59 patients; 3 buboes yielded H. ducreyi and 9 were positive for C. trachomatis. All cultures for other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and viruses in intact buboes were negative. Syphilis serology was positive in only one case. Patients attending STD clinics in this region who have large, fluctuant, edematous <b>inguinal</b> <b>buboes</b> containing pus should receive presumptive treatment for chancroid. If there is no pus, then the bubo {{is more likely to}} be caused by lymphogranuloma venereum...|$|R
40|$|<b>Inguinal</b> and femoral <b>buboes</b> {{are defined}} as {{localized}} enlargement of lymph nodes in the groin that are painful, and {{may or may not}} be fluctuant. We report a case of 42 -year-old female who presented with bilateral inguinal swelling of 6 months duration. After a complete evaluation, she was found to be a case of isolated inguinal tuberculous lymphadenitis. There was complete resolution with standard antituberculous therapy. Isolated inguinal tuberculous lymphadenitis though a rare entity in developed countries is not uncommon in developing nations. In this era of syndromic management of sexually transmitted diseases, which carries its own pros and cons, this case report emphasizes the need to look beyond the venereal causes and calls for thorough evaluation and management...|$|R
40|$|Chancroid is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} disease (STD) caused by the Gram negative bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi and is characterised by necrotising genital ulceration which may be accompanied by <b>inguinal</b> lymphadenitis or <b>bubo</b> formation. H ducreyi is a fastidious organism which is difficult to culture from genital ulcer material. DNA amplification techniques have shown improved diagnostic sensitivity but are only performed in a few laboratories. The management of chancroid in the tropics tends to be undertaken {{in the context of}} syndromic management of genital ulcer disease and treatment is usually with erythromycin. A number of single dose regimens are also available to treat H ducreyi infection. Genital ulceration as a syndrome has been associated with increased transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in several cross sectional and longitudinal studies. Effective and early treatment of genital ulceration is therefore an important part of any strategy to control the spread of HIV infection in tropical countries...|$|R
