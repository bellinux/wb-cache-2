30|$|When a DC side fault occurs, the insulated-gate bipolar {{transistors}} of the inverter will be blocked under self-protection. At this time, the capacitor voltage Udc {{is greater than}} the peak value of the inter-phase voltage of the AC side. Additionally, the AC side system cannot supply power to the DC side system through the <b>free-wheel</b> diodes. The DC side system can be regarded as a circuit structure in which the capacitor discharges to the short-circuit point. After the capacitor voltage drops below the peak value of the inter-phase voltage of the AC side, the <b>free-wheel</b> diodes will turn on, and will most likely be damaged by the fault current [3]. Therefore, the SI-FCL that provides ample time for the breaker to clear the fault should limit the fault current and delay the voltage drop time of the capacitor before the <b>free-wheel</b> diodes turns on.|$|R
40|$|DE 102008048841 B 3 UPAB: 20100214 NOVELTY - The circuit (30) has {{an energy}} storage element (C 01) e. g. capacitor, {{connected}} with inputs (10, 12) and storing energy {{received from the}} inputs. Electronic switches (S 01, S 02) are switched between the energy storage element and outputs (36, 38). The switches connect the energy storage element with the outputs during a <b>free-wheel</b> phase of a single-phase inverter (26), and isolate the energy storage element from the outputs outside the <b>free-wheel</b> phase of the inverter. The storage element is switched between a connection and another connection of the inputs. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a system for converting a received direct current voltage into an alternating voltage, comprising a solar generator (2) a method for converting the received direct current voltage into the alternating voltage by the solar generator. USE - Isolating circuit for a single-phase inverter in a H 4 -bridge circuit for converting an electrical direct current voltage into an elctrical alternating voltage. ADVANTAGE - The switches connect the energy storage element with the outputs during the <b>free-wheel</b> phase of the single-phase inverter, and isolate the energy storage element from the outputs outside the <b>free-wheel</b> phase of the inverter, so that a grounded solar generator is separated, thus avoiding a short-circuit between the generator and a grounded network...|$|R

More recently on December 23, 2008, Sheindlin shared about her life on Shatner's Raw Nerve, {{in which she was}} interviewed by William Shatner. A year later in December 2009, Sheindlin again told the story of her life, legal career, authoring career, and entertainment courtroom career from an updated perspective in a two-hour interview for Archive of American Television.

40|$|To {{satisfy the}} ion beam {{luminosity}} requirements for CERN's future Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a small accumulator, the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR), {{is being built}} in the injector chain of accelerators.

The paper discusses the bumper system, in particular the power supplies which will produce a pulsed current linearly decreasing from 1. 2 kA to zero in a time variable between 120 µs and 300 µs. Each power supply employs a primary discharge circuit, comprising a storage capacitor, an IGBT switch and the magnet load inductance, to establish the peak current, and a <b>free-wheel</b> circuit in parallel with the magnet, comprising a diode and capacitor, to produce the linear current slope.
