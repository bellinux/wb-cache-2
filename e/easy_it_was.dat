He described how <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to find and download the film even if the original source of the leak was no longer available on the web. The article he wrote for his column on the Fox News website was immediately removed.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{objectives}} involved {{evaluating the}} performance of the spacecraft over six orbits, as well as the effect of prolonged microgravity on the pilot. The specific spacecraft systems would also be evaluated and tested, and the worldwide tracking and communications network would be tested to see how well it would stand up in an extended mission. The flight control experiments included manually turning the spacecraft around, yaw and pitch manoeuvres to determine how <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to control the spacecraft attitude, realignment of the onboard gyroscopes in flight, and leaving the spacecraft to drift on-orbit.|$|E
5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national figure. He decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter. He was surprised at how <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to get close to the president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his parents, {{would be good for the}} country. He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E

5|$|Micro Machines was {{completed}} in September 1990. The game did not go through quality assurance, and as a result, a major bug that caused the game to crash was discovered near completion. The bug occurred when the player tried to reverse on the first race, and escaped notice because none of the testers thought to do so as {{they thought it was}} so <b>easy.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> determined that just one binary bit was wrong, and a device that functioned like a miniature Game Genie was installed on the cartridges to correct it, as by the time the bug was discovered, there were plenty of ROM chips containing the bugged version. Micro Machines was released for the NES by Camerica in 1991. Nintendo wanted development halted because Codemasters did not have a licence from them, and sued Galoob over the sales of the Game Genie. Courts ruled in Galoob's favour (Nintendo appealed, but the ruling was upheld), but the legal issues meant that sales of the NES version were not as good as hoped.|$|E
25|$|The Sega SG-1000, the Memotech MTX and the Colecovision {{all have}} many {{similarities}} with the MSX1 standard, but none are really compatible with it. Porting games between those systems is somewhat <b>easy.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> also very common to port games from the ZX Spectrum to the MSX, since both {{have the same}} CPU, the Spectrum 128 had the same soundchip, and the ZX Spectrum's graphic mode could be easily emulated on the MSX's screen-2 mode.|$|E

As more people learned how <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to produce podcasts, a community of pioneer podcasters quickly appeared. Despite a lack of a commonly accepted identifying name for the medium {{at the time of its}} creation, Daily Source Code is commonly believed to be the first podcast to be published online.|$|E

500|$|Upon Alston's death, MLB {{commissioner}} Peter Ueberroth {{referred to}} {{him as one of}} baseball's greatest managers. Former Dodgers great Duke Snider acknowledged occasional run-ins with Alston, but he said that Alston excelled at utilizing the specific strengths of each team that he managed. Tommy Lasorda, who played and coached under Alston and ultimately succeeded him as manager, commented on how <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to play for Alston. Broadcaster Vin Scully said, [...] "I always imagined him to be the type who could ride shotgun on a stage through Indian territory. He was all man and two yards tall. He was very quiet, very controlled. He never made excuses. He gave the players the credit and he took the blame. He was so solid, so American." ...|$|E

To pursue her goal, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 15 and attended Horizon High School during her junior and senior years while living with multiple host families. Despite having a challenging time adjusting to life without her family and friends, she helped lead Sereno Soccer Club to state titles in 2007 and 2008. Of her move to the United States, she said, [...] "It was not <b>easy.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{probably one of the most}} difficult things I ever had to do, move away from everything that I knew and was comfortable with to something that I had no idea about. Not having any family around. Doing it on my own. As a 15-year-old, that's kind of hard. I had to grow up really fast [...] But I guess it's all worth it. Now I have a chance to prove myself, and that's what I enjoy, and that's why I did what I did." ...|$|E

500|$|Bowie {{elected to}} play less {{well-known}} {{songs on the}} tour and avoided some of his bigger hits. He was eager to not repeat the formula that made the Serious Moonlight Tour a success, saying, [...] "It seemed so <b>easy.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> cheers from the word go. You {{know how to get}} a reaction – play 'Changes,' 'Golden Years' and they'd be up on their feet. You get the reaction, take the money and run away. It seemed too easy. I didn't want to do that again." [...] In a different contemporary interview he said, [...] "I'm not doing 'Star' again. That was quite hard. I don't think I'm doing much Ziggy material on this tour! [...] Probably use a lot of that mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I tried that, and that was a bit yawn-making. There was one I was humming to myself the other day: [...] 'Baby, baby, I'll never let you down' – oh lord, what's that one? Jesus, I can't remember it. ... 'Sons of the Silent Age!' [...] Ah! That's right! Thank god I could remember it! So that for me now is a new song. I've never done that one onstage." [...] "Sons of the Silent Age" [...] was performed every night of the tour.|$|E
500|$|Workman, {{herself an}} ardent feminist and a {{supporter}} of women's suffrage, wanted her readers to understand how her contributions and achievements reflected all women's potential. In her writings, Workman described herself as [...] "questioning or violating the norms of Victorian female propriety". She demonstrated that women were strong enough to thrive outside the home by showing how <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for her to endure strenuous physical activities like bicycling long distances in hot, humid places or mountaineering in cold temperatures and high altitudes. Workman challenged a masculine realm; her obituary in the Alpine Journal alluded to the challenges she faced, saying that she [...] "felt that she suffered from 'sex antagonism'". The author of the piece added: [...] "it {{is possible that some}} unconscious feeling let us say of the novelty of a woman's intrusion into the domain of exploration so long reserved to man, may in some quarters have existed... there tended to arise... an atmosphere shall we say of aloofness?" [...] However, in her study of Victorian mountaineering, Ann Colley suggests that gender discrimination was more overt at lower elevations and in regular life than at higher elevations, such as in the Himalaya. Colley states, [...] "Away from such petty opinion emanating from society pressures, up high, above the snow line or in distant regions, women climbers could more fully experience equality and power... If they chose, they could be just as sportsmanlike or competitive as the men." [...] In her entry about Workman in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Tingley sums Workman up as [...] "an aggressive, determined, and uncompromising turn-of-the-century American woman traveler" [...] and [...] "one of the first women to work as a professional mountaineer and surveyor and to write about the expeditions she and her husband took to the most remote reaches of the Himalaya. She was an outspoken advocate of woman's suffrage and made it clear that she considered herself {{to be a role model}} for other women travelers and mountaineers." ...|$|E

Advertising was an emerging concept, and tobacco-related advertisements were not seen as any different from those for other products: their negative impact on health was unknown at the time. Local and regional newspapers were used because of the small-scale production and transportation of these goods. The first real brand name to become known on a bigger scale in the USA was [...] "Bull Durham" [...] which emerged in 1868, with the advertising placing the emphasis on how <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "to roll your own".|$|E

2500|$|In February 1590, a nobleman from Cambrai, Charles de Heraugiere {{under orders}} from Maurice of Nassau {{was to make}} a covert reconnoiter of Breda. Disguised as a {{fisherman}} he was hoping to enter Breda and to study its weaknesses, garrison strength and general conditions. Heraugiere contacted Adrian van den Berg, loyal to the Dutch by trade who was used to entering and leaving Breda with a barge loaded of winter fuel, in this case peat. Heraugiere went into the city, hidden between the peat of the barge along {{with a small group of}} soldiers, but they discovered how incredibly <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> as none of the garrison checked the barge. [...] When they were in the heart of Breda they made a hasty exit with enough peat to keep them covered.

2500|$|Wall {{was born}} to a German Mennonite family in Ukraine, and he spent his {{childhood}} in Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Austria. In 1948, he moved to Canada {{with his mother and}} five siblings. The family settled in Abbotsford, British Columbia. Wall enrolled at the University of British Columbia in 1958, where he studied chemistry but did not graduate. Given C$6,000 by his mother to build a house, he sold the finished product for $13,000 before she had moved in. He later claimed he [...] "discovered right then how <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to make money in the real-estate business". Despite his early exit from academia, he donated $15million to UBC in 1991, at the time the largest private donation it had received. The university used the gift to found the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies. In 1995, UBC awarded Wall an honorary doctorate. His degree citation credited him with [...] "a creative and innovative mind which allows him to bring unconventional solutions to otherwise insoluble problems".|$|E

[...] She just doesn't care what anybody thinks; she's so committed to what she thinks is right, and everyone else be damned. [...] But she has a heart of gold, and she's very strong. [...] To be a female as strong as she was, in the kind of world she came from, was wonderful, I think." [...] Lauding the character, Adams says that it's Ishka's backbone that helps her grow as an actress and as a person.
