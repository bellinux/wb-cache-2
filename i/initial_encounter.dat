5|$|Pope Paul III claimed some {{rights in}} Klis, and in September, 1536, {{there was talk}} in the Curia of {{strengthening}} the defenses of the fortress. The Pope notified Ferdinand {{that he was willing}} to share the costs of maintaining a proper garrison in Klis. Ferdinand did send aid to Klis and was apparently hopeful of holding the fortress, when the Ottomans again laid siege to it. Ferdinand recruited men from Trieste and elsewhere in the Habsburg lands, and the Pope sent soldiers from Ancona. There were about 3,000 infantry in the reinforcements, which made a sizeable relief force, that were commanded by Petar Kružić, Niccolo dalla Torre, and a papal commissioner Jacomo Dalmoro d'Arbe. On 9 March 1537 they disembarked near Klis, at a place called S. Girolamo, with fourteen pieces of artillery. After Ibrahim's death, Suleiman sent 8,000 men under the command of Murat-beg Tardić (Amurat Vaivoda), a Croatian who had been born in Šibenik, to go and lay siege to Klis fortress (Clissa), and fight against Kružić. An <b>initial</b> <b>encounter</b> of the Christian relief force with the Ottomans was indecisive, but, on 12 March they were overwhelmed by the arrival of a great number of Ottomans.|$|E

The first was Thomas Weeding, a fellow doctor, and surgeon of the Glatton, one of the other ships in the convoy.

25|$|The revised 2016 dating of 50,000 {{years ago}} {{is close to the}} time that modern humans reached the area, {{suggesting}} that the <b>initial</b> <b>encounter</b> with H.sapiens caused or contributed to the demise of H.floresiensis. This would be consistent with the disappearance of H.neanderthalensis from Europe about 40,000 years ago, within 5,000 years after the arrival of modern humans there, and other anthropogenic extinctions. Skeletal material from modern humans dated to 46,000 years ago has been recovered from the Liang Bua cave, strengthening the evidence for a role for modern humans in the extinction. Subsequent to this date, other megafauna of the island (such as the proboscid Stegodon florensis insularis and the giant stork Leptoptilos robustus) also disappeared.|$|E

In this <b>initial</b> <b>encounter,</b> two Union divisions of over 5,000 men were thrown back across Gravelly Run by three Confederate brigades. Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin's division and the V Corps artillery under Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Charles S. Wainwright finally stopped the Confederate advance short of crossing Gravelly Run. Adjacent to the V Corps, Major General Andrew A. Humphreys conducted diversionary demonstrations and sent two of Brigadier General Nelson Miles's brigades from his II Corps forward. They initially surprised and, after a sharp fight, drove back Wise's brigade on {{the left of the}} Confederate line, taking about 100 prisoners.|$|E

On March 3, 1988, nearly a year after their <b>initial</b> <b>encounter</b> Roma & Powers again faced Demolition (Ax now with Barry Darsow as Smash) on Prime Time Wrestling.

50|$|I {{acknowledge}} that the children’s <b>initial</b> <b>encounters</b> with the Virgin {{may well have been}} caused by personal factors. For example, Ivanka, who was the first to perceive a visitation, had just lost her natural mother. The perception of apparitional experiences spread rapidly among her intimate peer group... The region’s tension and anxiety likely exacerbated this contagion process and the need to believe among the youthful protagonists.|$|R
40|$|Communication {{expectancy}} and reinforcement {{principles are}} systematically integrated {{to explain the}} effectiveness of communication strategies focused on improving initial and long-term medical adherence and patient satisfaction. Study 1 analyzed patients' evaluations of communication regard strategies {{and the effectiveness of}} these strategies in <b>initial</b> <b>encounters.</b> It was predicted that physician gender would {{play a major role in}} patients' communication evaluations. As predicted, negative regard influence strategies used by male physicians were perceived as more appropriate than negative regard influence strategies used by female physicians. Results did not indicate gender differences in perceptions of expectancies or relational concern as communicated by regard strategies. Study 1 also addressed the effectiveness of influence attempts in <b>initial</b> <b>encounters</b> with a physician. The study supports the predicted interaction for communication effectiveness in <b>initial</b> <b>encounters.</b> Specifically, the results support the claim that female physicians are limited to the use of positive regard strategies whereas male physicians are more effective persuaders using either positive or negative regard strategies. The results also indicate that the use of negative regard strategies by male physicians does not hinder patient satisfaction or physician perceptions, whereas the use of negative regard strategies by female physicians is negatively related to these outcome measures. The reinforcement expectancy framework tested in Study 2 argued that occasional use of nonrewarding communication would facilitate communication effectiveness for both male and female physician in ongoing physician-patient relationships. The results supported this assumption. Physician gender, however, did not mediate the effectiveness of certain strategy combinations as expected. Finally, the investigation found that previous exposure to any type of physician communications style, as opposed to never having seen the physician, facilitated a physician's influence attempts...|$|R

However, he wanted a wife and children, and in October 1933, he began proceedings for the annulment of the marriage on the grounds of [...] "lack of real consent". The case was heard by an ecclesiastical tribunal in London, but a delay in the submission of the papers to Rome meant that the annulment was not granted until 4 July 1936. In the meantime, following their <b>initial</b> <b>encounter</b> in Portofino, Waugh {{had fallen in love with}} Laura Herbert. He proposed marriage, by letter, in spring 1936. There were initial misgivings from the Herberts, an aristocratic Catholic family; as a further complication, Laura Herbert was a cousin of Evelyn Gardner. Despite some family hostility the marriage took place on 17 April 1937 at the Church of the Assumption in Warwick Street, London.|$|E
500|$|In London, Grainger's charm, {{good looks}} and talent (with some {{assistance}} from the local Australian community) ensured that he was quickly taken up as a pianist by wealthy patrons, and was soon performing in concerts in private homes. The Times critic recorded after one such appearance that Grainger's playing [...] "revealed rare intelligence {{and a good deal}} of artistic insight". [...] In 1902 he was presented by the socialite Lillith Lowrey to Queen Alexandra, who thereafter frequently attended [...] his London recitals. Lowrey, 20 years Grainger's senior, traded patronage and contacts for sexual favours – he termed the relationship a [...] "love-serve job". She was the first woman with whom he had sex; he later wrote of this <b>initial</b> <b>encounter</b> that he had experienced [...] "an overpowering landslide" [...] of feeling, and that [...] "I thought I was about to die.

500|$|Mulan {{explores the}} age-old theme of {{remaining}} true to oneself, with co-director Tony Bancroft summarizing the character's {{role in the}} film as [...] "the story of a girl who can't help who she is but she exists in a different society that tells her who she is supposed to be." [...] Because the Ballad of Mulan is such a beloved and well-known story, San Souci longed to maintain the character's integrity. However, certain creative liberties were taken with the story in regards to Mulan's role, such as the character neglecting to ask her parents' permission prior to enlisting herself in the army. Additionally, Mulan's surname was changed from [...] "Hua" [...] to [...] "Fa." [...] Finally, Mulan's true identity is discovered much earlier in the film, soon after the army's <b>initial</b> <b>encounter</b> with the enemy, whereas her comrades remain ignorant throughout their entire 12 years at war until after Mulan has returned home.|$|E

Den of Geek!'s Max Williams referenced the sequence as [...] "one beautiful encounter". However, Owen Vaughan of News.com.au responded negatively to Marlohe during the promotional interviews for Skyfall, writing that she acted [...] "robotic and awkward" [...] suggesting that she was not a strong actor.|$|E

She first met Gordon in 2000 while she was employed in Palm Beach, Florida at a Neiman Marcus store in a mall where she advised customers about cosmetics products. Merryman did not recognize the race-car driver at their first meeting, though her friends were excited to meet him during the same encounter. Initially Merryman turned down Gordon's request to take her out for lunch. One year after their <b>initial</b> <b>encounter,</b> they began {{a relationship}}. They were romantically-linked for 11 months. Merryman and Gordon vacationed together in Saint-Jean, Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean in January 2003 to celebrate the New Year. This relationship caused difficulty for his then-ongoing marriage to Brooke Sealy. Sealy discovered Gordon's relationship with Merryman and subsequently divorced the race-car driver. Gordon's wife, who also went by the name Jennifer Brooke Gordon, cited Merryman by name in her divorce papers with the racecar driver. Merryman was featured in the October 2003 issue of Playboy magazine, where she was interviewed about her relationship with Gordon. Merryman stated that Gordon had confided in her: [...] "He got married when he was 23 and has been on the racetrack since he was a kid. He used to tell me all the time he {{never had a chance to}} have fun." [...] She reflected on what she had learned after her period of time with Gordon, saying in the future she would avoid relationships both with men of his occupation and those who were married. Gordon did not comment on Merryman's 2003 appearance in the magazine. When asked about the article, Gordon refused to comment on it. He stated: [...] "It's not even worth commenting on. All I want to talk about is being fast". Gordon's divorce was finalized in June 2003.|$|E
