5|$|French {{psychoanalyst}} Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis with Kantian {{ethics in}} his works The Ethics of Psychoanalysis and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade. Lacan argued that Sade's maxim of jouissance—the pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment—is morally acceptable by Kant's criteria {{because it can}} be universalised. He proposed that, while Kant presented <b>human</b> <b>freedom</b> as critical to the moral law, Sade further argued that <b>human</b> <b>freedom</b> is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance.|$|E
5|$|Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, {{which partly}} {{touches on the}} problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself {{considered}} four years earlier, in Free Will). Quoting the New Testament, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature. Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained <b>human</b> <b>freedom,</b> in a way similar to the formation of habits. This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of <b>human</b> <b>freedom</b> caused by sin. Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of {{scientists}} and philosophers to propose a two-stage model of free will. Others include William James, Henri Poincaré, Karl Popper, Henry Margenau, and Daniel Dennett. In 1931, Compton championed the idea of <b>human</b> <b>freedom</b> based on quantum indeterminacy, and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger's cat paradox, which was published in 1935.|$|E

40|$|Two {{enduring}} human concerns {{throughout the}} world are (a) the various freedoms enjoyed (or not enjoyed) by citizens of different nations, and (b) {{the presence or absence}} of corruption among public officials and politicians of those same countries. This paper explores the relationship between <b>human</b> <b>freedoms</b> and corruption in national public life around the globe. A common conception of the relationship between <b>human</b> <b>freedoms</b> and corruption is that increasing freedoms create more opportunities for corruption. A competing hypothesis is that freedoms, by providing greater opportunities for personal choice, action, responsibility, and accountability, decrease corruption. A third proposition ⎯ examined in this paper ⎯ posits a curvilinear relationship, of the cubic form, between freedoms and corruption. Specifically, at low levels of <b>human</b> <b>freedoms,</b> corruption will increase as freedoms increase; at moderate to moderately high levels of freedoms, corruption will decrease as freedoms increase; and at very high levels of freedoms, a threshold point will be reached, beyond which corruption will increase. This proposition is tested using polynomial regression analysis, with corruption as the dependent variable and <b>human</b> <b>freedoms</b> as the independent variable. Corruption is gauged with the Corruption Perceptions Index published by Transparency International. <b>Human</b> <b>freedoms</b> are measured with an index created by factor analyzing various published measures of economic, political/civil, cultural, and religious freedoms. Results support the curvilinear hypothesis, and implications and limitations of those results are discussed. 1...|$|R

5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and <b>human</b> <b>freedom,</b> {{and the belief that}} it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of life}} (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.|$|E

25|$|Moltmann relates {{his views}} on the trinity to three modes of <b>human</b> <b>freedom.</b> The first mode is the {{political}} meaning of freedom as supremacy. This mode is rejected by Moltmann, who sees it as corresponding to a God who rules over his creation, which exists merely to serve Him. It is a relation of a subject with an object, where {{the goal is to}} enhance the supremacy of the subject. The second mode of <b>human</b> <b>freedom</b> is the socio-historical and Hegelian meaning of freedom as communion, which implies the relation between two subjects. This relationship aims at love and solidarity, and corresponds to the perichoresis of the Father and Son, and through the Son the children of God, or humanity. This relationship is both liberating and loving, and is one Moltmann favors. The third mode of <b>human</b> <b>freedom</b> is the implicitly religious concept of freedom as the passion of the creature for his or her potential. This deals with the relationship between subjects and their common future project. This is the mode favored most by Moltmann, who correlates this relationship with the one humans share with God {{in the realm of the}} Holy Spirit. Here, an indwelling of the Spirit allows humans to be friends with God. As you can see, the first mode of freedom is political, and focuses on The Father; the second is communal, focusing on the Son; and the third is religious, focusing on the Spirit.|$|E

40|$|Considering {{people as}} agents {{of their own lives}} is central in Amartya Sen's freedom-centred {{approach}} to development.

The paper highlights a major tension between the promotion of <b>human</b> <b>freedoms</b> and the exercise of political freedom, and examines ways in which this tension may be loosened. It suggests that the consequentialist space of well-being evaluation that Sen's capability approach advocates be supplemented by a procedural space. In parallel to Martha Nussbaum's 'thick vague theory of the good', which deals with the indeterminacy of Sen's consequentialist evaluation, the paper proposes a 'thick vague theory of political freedom' that hopes to offer some answers to the problems involved with promoting <b>human</b> <b>freedoms</b> through the exercise of political freedom.
