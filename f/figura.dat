These are cut-out panels of azulejos with life-size figures (footmen, halberdiers, noblemen or elegantly dressed ladies), usually placed in entrances of palaces (see Palácio da Mitra), patios and stair landings. Their purpose was to welcome visitors. They can only be found in Portugal.|$|E
25|$|Small bronze {{figures for}} collector's cabinets, often mythological {{subjects}} with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which Giambologna, originally Flemish but based in Florence, excelled {{in the later}} part of the century, also creating life-size sculptures, of which two joined the collection in the Piazza della Signoria. He and his followers devised elegant elongated examples of the <b>figura</b> serpentinata, often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from all angles.|$|E

25|$|Thirdly, his {{integration}} of Italian styles with the German tradition he was trained in is perhaps {{more effective than}} that of any Northern painter since Dürer (with the exception of his friend Rubens). His compositions tend to underplay {{the drama of the}} events they depict (in noticeable contrast to those of Rubens), but often show the start of moments of transformation. His figures are relatively short and stocky, and reflect little of classical ideals. Their poses and gestures are unflamboyant, and their facial expressions resemble those in Early Netherlandish painting rather than the bella <b>figura</b> of most Italian Renaissance work.|$|E

500|$|Following Mercator's death {{his family}} {{prepared}} the Atlas for publication—in four months. It was, after all, a hoped for {{source of the}} income that was needed to support them. This work entailed supplementing the maps of the 1585 and 1589 with 28 unpublished maps of Mercator covering the northern countries, creating four maps of the continents and a world map, the printing of Mercator's account of the creation and finally the addition of eulogies and Walter Ghim's biography of Mercator. The title itself provides Mercator's definition of a new meaning for the word [...] "Atlas": Atlas Sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati <b>Figura</b> which may be translated as [...] "Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon {{the fabric of the}} world and the figure of the fabrick’d, or, more colloquially, as Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe, and the universe as created."

500|$|With his old mentor George Cecil Jones, Crowley {{continued}} {{performing the}} Abramelin rituals at the Ashdown Park Hotel in Coulsdon, Surrey. Crowley claimed that {{in doing so}} he attained samadhi, or union with Godhead, thereby marking {{a turning point in}} his life. Making heavy use of hashish during these rituals, he wrote an essay on [...] "The Psychology of Hashish" [...] (1909) in which he championed the drug as an aid to mysticism. He also claimed to have been contacted once again by Aiwass in late October and November 1907, adding that Aiwass dictated two further texts to him, [...] "Liber VII" [...] and [...] "Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente", both of which were later classified in the corpus of Holy Books of Thelema. Crowley wrote down more Thelemic Holy Books during the last two months of the year, including [...] "Liber LXVI", [...] "Liber Arcanorum", [...] "Liber Porta Lucis, Sub <b>Figura</b> X", [...] "Liber Tau", [...] "Liber Trigrammaton" [...] and [...] "Liber DCCCXIII vel Ararita", which he again claimed to have received from a preternatural source. Crowley stated that in June 1909, when the manuscript of The Book of the Law was rediscovered at Boleskine, he developed the opinion that Thelema represented objective truth.|$|E
500|$|On January 22, 2010, Volador Jr. {{teamed up}} with El Terrible to {{participate}} in CMLL's [...] "Torneo Nacional de Pareja Increíbles" [...] ("National Amazing Pairs tournament"), a tournament where CMLL teams up a Tecnico (Volador Jr.) and a Rudo (El Terrible) for a tournament. In {{the second round of}} the tournament the team faced Averno and Místico. Initially Místico wrestle as the tecnico he has been for years, but during the match Místico's attitude seemily changed as he began attacking Volador Jr., someone he had teamed with for years. Místico even went so far as to ripping up Volador's mask, a rudo move, and won the match after an illegal low blow to Volador Jr. After the match Místico took the microphone and claimed that [...] "all was fair in war and defending Mexico City", a comment that drew many boos from the crowd. The two met in the main event of an Arena México show on February 5, 2010, and this time Místico was clearly a Rúdo, tearing so viciously at Volador's mask that a new mask had to be brought to the ring during falls. In the second fall Místico pulled his mask off and threw it to Volador Jr. in an attempt to get Volador Jr. disqualified. The end came when Volador Jr. reversed Místico's La Mística and won by applying the same move to Místico. Following the match Místico angrily proclaimed “¡Yo soy la máxima <b>figura</b> de la lucha libre!”. ("I am the greatest figure in wrestling"). On February 12, 2010, Místico lost the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship to Volador Jr. two falls to one. On the February 26 CMLL Super Viernes show it was announced that Místico, Volador Jr., La Sombra and El Felino would face off in a four way Lucha de Apuesta match as the main event of the 2010 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas. La Sombra was the first man pinned at Dos Leyendas and El Felino was the second, forcing the two to put their masks on the line. After a long match La Sombra pinned El Felino. After the match he unmasked and announced that his real name was Jorge Luis Casas Ruiz. Following Dos Leyendas Místico announced that he was done being a rúdo and returned to the técnico side, although Volador Jr. remained suspicious of Místico. The storyline between the two cooled off for a bit, but in late May 2010, tension resumed as Místico and Volador Jr. faced off once again at the Mexican Light Heavyweight Championship, with Volador Jr. retaining the belt. At the 2010 Sin Salida the two were on opposite sides of a Relevos incredibles, Místico teamed with Máscara Dorada and Mr. Águila while Volador Jr. teamed with Averno and Negro Casas. Averno came to the ring wearing the same combined Averno/Místico mask he had worn for the Parejas Incredibles tournament and tried to convince Místico to join the rúdo side, only to turn around and reveal that both he and Volador Jr. were wearing a combined Averno/Volador Jr. mask underneath. Volador Jr. worked as a rúdo throughout the match, losing the match for his team when he tried to cheat but was caught by the referee. On July 12, 2010, at the Promociones Gutiérrez 1st Anniversary Show, Volador Jr. participated in a match where 10 men put their mask on the line in a match that featured five pareja incredibles teams, with the losing team being forced to wrestle each other with their mask on the line. His partner in the match was El Alebrije, facing off against the teams of Atlantis and Olímpico, Místico and El Oriental, Histeria and La Sombra, and Último Guerrero and Averno. Volador Jr. and El Alebrije were the second team to escape the match. In the end Místico defeated El Oriental to unmask him. After teasing a rudo turn for over a month, Volador Jr. and La Sombra lost the CMLL World Tag Team Championship to the Los Invasores team of Mr. Águila and Héctor Garza on July 23, 2010 without any signs of dissension between the two. During a later show Volador Jr. finally turned rudo when he attacked La Sombra, tore his former partner's mask off and beat him up. During the 2010 Universal Championship tournament, Volador Jr. defeated Valiente in the first round. In the second round Volador Jr. faced La Máscara and cemented his status as a rudo when he was disqualified for excessive violence against La Máscara. He kept attacking La Máscara after the match ended, leaving La Máscara an easy victim for his next round opponent, Jushin Thunder Liger.|$|E
