Generally residents were expected {{to stay at the}} <b>Holding</b> <b>Centre</b> <b>between</b> four to six months. Some stayed until they had completed their migration agreement obligations to the Australian Government, which was 2 years’ labour contract. A number stayed much longer — in some instances up to 15 years. Residents were required to pay a tariff for their accommodation.|$|R

40|$|According to many current {{theories}} of coherence relations, a distinction {{can be drawn}} <b>between</b> relations that <b>hold</b> <b>between</b> {{the content of the}} text spans they link (which can be termed semantic relations), and those that <b>hold</b> <b>between</b> the utterances of the text spans themselves or the beliefs which underlie them (which can be termed pragmatic). However, this distinction is not always clearcut. One useful recent proposal by Sweetser eectively results in dividing the class of pragmatic relations in two, distinguishing between epistemic relations (which <b>hold</b> <b>between</b> the beliefs which underlie a speaker's utterances) and speech-act relations (which <b>hold</b> <b>between</b> the utterances themselves). In this paper I begin by reviewing the advantages and shortcomings of both these approaches. I then propose an alternative, intention-based denition of pragmatic relations, which I argue retains the advantages of both approaches while avoiding at least some of their shortcomings. 1 Introduction This pape [...] ...|$|R
