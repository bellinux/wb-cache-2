40|$|Data {{concerning}} <b>ion</b> <b>budget</b> from rainfall, runoff {{and soil}} loss measurements from two experimental plots located in North-East Italy, under different land cover (beech forest and vineyard, respectively), are reported. The chemical composition of rainfall, soil solution and runoff {{was determined to}} study the solute cycle within the soil, and the relationships between water, soil and vegetation. The forest ecosystem is more prone to acidification than the agricultural one; the elemental concentration of runoff water is considerably {{lower than that of}} soil solution. Comparing the ion input (rainfall) and output (runoff) at the two sites, it was possible to estimate the <b>ion</b> <b>budget</b> in the two soil-vegetation systems. The runoff amount and the ion balance are related to rainfall volumes and composition; the measured runoff under vineyard is 59 % in comparison to the one under beech. The soil loss at the two experimental sites (170 kg/ha and 132 kg/ha, respectively) is quite limited. The measured sediment yield of the two catchments (0. 24 – 0. 19 t/ha/year, respectively) is consistent with data reported for native forests of western Europe. Comparing rainfall and soil loss at the two sites proved that maintenance of some form of land cover is advisable if runoff and erosion are to be minimized. In the European context, where the most important consequences of erosion are sedimentation downstream and loss of productivity, this type of data will yield valuable information for the understanding of such processes occurring at catchment scale, and will help policy-makers develop appropriate programs for the territory safeguard...|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} acidification of Lake 223 (Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario) with {{sulfuric acid}} in 1976 - 1983 allowed a detailed {{examination of the}} capacity of the lake to neutralize hydrogen ion. A whole-lake alkalinity and <b>ion</b> <b>budget</b> for Lake 223 showed that 66 - 81 % of the added sulfuric acid was neutralized by alkalinity production in the lake. Nearly 85 % of in situ alkalinity production was accounted for by net loss of sulfate through bacterial sulfate reduction, coupled with iron reduction and iron sulfide formation, in littoral sediments (60 %) and in the hypolimnion (25 %). Exchange of hydrogen ion for calcium and manganese in the sediments accounted for 19 % of the alkalinity generated, while other cations were net sinks for alkalinity. Alkalinity input from the watershed of Lake 223 was very small, averaging about 5 % of that produced in the lake. The seasonal production of 1, 000 peq liter- * alkalinity in the anoxic hypolimnion of this softwater lake could be attributed to bacterial sulfate reduction coupled with iron sulfide formation, ammonium production, and iron (II) production. Only the alkalinity produced from bacterial sulfate reduction coupled with iron sulfide formation remained throughout the annual cycle.

The calculation {{is based on the}} ion densities measured by the INMS instrument on Cassini orbiter during flyby T 19 at 1200 km of altitude. The dissociative recombination exhaustive chemical model is taken from Plessis et al. [1]. Neutral fluxes are compared with those predicted by the photochemical model of Hébrard et al. [2]. The comparison shows that the neutral production rates are at least of the same order of magnitude, with neutral fluxes from DR reactions which are often even larger. This first study confirms the necessity to build coupled models for the ionosphere taking into account the respective impacts of ions on the neutrals and of neutrals on the <b>ions</b> <b>budget.</b> Moreover we show that the highly dissociative contribution of the ion-electron recombinations leads to cascade effects on the neutral budget, with significant contribution to neutral species smaller than their parent ion.

40|$|Abstract: Solute {{budgets and}} within system {{variations}} in water chemistry {{have been studied}} at three catchments in western Britain. The solute budgets showed a net export of calcium and silica from all three sites and of aluminium and magnesium from two. Hydrogen <b>ion</b> <b>budgets,</b> based on bulk precipitation inputs and streamwater outputs, underestimated inputs of acidity and fail {{to take account of}} within system sources. At two sites the aluminium and silica were derived from the soils and the calcium and magnesium from the bedrock compartment. There was little, if any, weathering of the mudstone and slate bedrocks at these two sites; calcium and magnesium were derived from carbonate veins and/or dolerite intrusions. At the third site, aluminium and silica were released from the upper soil, and calcium and magnesium from the lower soil or underlying, calcareous till. Catchment hydrology was,a major factor influencing the pattern and rate of weathering. Many catchment hydrochemical balance studies show a net output of cations and silica (e. g. Bricker et al. 1968; Johnson et al. 1968; Stednick 1981; Reid et al. 1981). The output is usually said to be derived from mineral weathering.

40|$|The United States Vision for Space Exploration, {{announced}} in January 2004, outlines the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) strategic goals and objectives, including retiring the Space Shuttle {{and replacing it}} with a new human-rated system suitable for missions to the Moon and Mars. The Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) that the new Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV) lofts into space early next decade will initially ferry astronauts to the International Space Station and be capable of carrying crews back to lunar orbit and of supporting missions to Mars orbit. NASA is using its extensive experience gained from past and ongoing launch vehicle programs to maximize the CLV system design approach, with the objective of reducing total lifecycle costs through operational efficiencies. To provide in-depth data for selecting this follow-on launch vehicle, the Exploration Systems Architecture Study was conducted during the summer of 2005, following the confirmation of the new NASA Administrator. A team of aerospace subject matter experts used technical, budget, and schedule objectives to analyze a number of potential launch systems, with a focus on human rating for exploration missions. The results showed that a variant of the Space Shuttle, utilizing the reusable Solid Rocket Booster as the first stage, along with a new upper stage that uses a derivative of the RS- 25 Space Shuttle Main Engine to deliver 25 metric tons to low-Earth orbit, was the best choice to reduce the risks associated with fielding a new system in a timely manner. The CLV Project, managed by the Exploration Launch Office located at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, is leading the design, development, testing, and operation of this new human-rated system. The CLV Project works closely with the Space Shuttle Program to transition hardware, infrastructure, and workforce assets to the new launch system. leveraging a wealth of lessons learned from Shuttle operations. The CL V is being designed to reduce costs through a number of methods, ranging from validating requirements to conducting trades studies against the concept design. Innovations such as automated processing will build on lessons learned from the Shuttle, other launch systems, Department of Defense operations experience, and subscale flight tests such as the Delta Clipper-Experimental Advanced (DCXA) vehicle operations that utilized minimal touch labor, automated cryogen ic propellant loading, and an 8 -hour turnaround for a cryogenic propulsion system. For the CLV, the results of hazard analyses are contributing to an integrated vehicle health monitoring system that will troubleshoot anomalies and determine which ones can be solved without human intervention. Such advances will help streamline the mission operations process for pilots and ground controllers alike. In fiscal year 2005, NASA invested approximately $ 4. 5 billion of its $ 16 bill <b>ion</b> <b>budget</b> on the Space Shuttle. The ultimate goal of the CLV Project is to deliver a safe, reliable system designed to minimize lifecycle costs so that NASA's budget can be invested in missions of scientific discovery.

40|$|A large {{data base}} was {{assembled}} from surveys conducted by several {{federal and state}} agencies on approximately 1500 inland lakes in the Upper Great Lakes Region (UGLR) [...] northern Minnesota and Wisconsin and Upper Michigan. Data were scrutinized carefully {{by a variety of}} quality control procedures, and outliers were eliminated. The quality-assured data base was used to characterize lakes in the three state region according to parameters related to the potential sensitivity of lakes to acidification (e. g alkalinity, pH, conductivity, hydrologic type). A trend of increasing numbers of acidic and very low alkalinity lakes across the region (from west to east) correlates with a similar trend in increasing acidity of precipitation. Drainage lakes are the dominant hydrologic lake type in northern Minnesota, but seepage lakes are most common in northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan. Most of the lakes in the data base (78 %) have organic color levels below 50 chloroplatinate units and are classified as "clearwater" systems. Correction of ion balances for contributions of organic anions was unnecessary for these lakes but was useful in improving ion balances of more highly colored lakes. A factor, CF, defined as the ratio of the average chloride concentration in a lake to the average chloride concentration in precipitation, was used as a surrogate measure for hydrologic data on evaporative concentration. Half the lakes had CF values between 2. 3 and 4. 4 (mean: 3. 8). A sulfate enrichment factor (SEF, defined as the sulfate/chloride ratio in a lake divided by the analogous ratio in precipitation) was used {{to determine whether or not}} sulfate behaves conservatively in lakes. SEF > 1 indicates the occurrence of terrestrial sources of sulfate in a lake's watershed; SEF < I indicates net loss of sulfate in a watershed or lake (presumably by sulfate reduction), if chloride is assumed to behave conservatively. Only 43 t of the lakes exhibited nearly conservative behavior (0. 75 < SEF < 1. 25), and 40 % of the lakes showed evidence of significant sulfate sinks. Two measures of acidification were defined for each lake: change in sulfate (ASO 4) and change in alkalinity (AAlk), both parameters being the difference between measured (present) lake values and background (pristine levels), which were estimated for each lake by a variety of methods. Several lines of evidence suggest that background sulfate levels in regional precipitation (bSO 4 p) were between 10 and 20 u. eq/L; multiplying these values times CF for a lake gives the lake's bSO 4. Good correlations were found between the two measures of lake acidification (ASO. and AAlk) among the UGLR lakes and especially among precipitation-dominated seepage lakes. A separate data base on chemical quality of atmospheric precipitation across the region was obtained from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and used with subsets of the lake data base to explore acid-loading lake response relationships. Significant relationships were found between ASO 4. and precipitation acidity (H+p) but not between AAlk and H+n for all lakes in the region. A weighted regression procedure showed that- H+p had significant relationships with boch ASO 4 and AAlk for seepage lakes,however, and these relationships were used to develop estimates of acid loading criteria designed to prevent the acidificacion of the most acid-sensitive lakes in each state. The critical H+p loading value estimated this way for Minnesota lakes is about 11 kg/ha-yr. A model to predict in-lake alkalinity generation (IAG) was developed based on CSTR (continuous-flow stirred reactor) kinetics. The model describes budgets for each ion involved in alkalinity regulation by a differential equation that includes terms for inputs and outputs and a first-order source/sink term. The equations are linked to an alkalinity balance equation that includes inputs, outputs, IAG by sulfate and nitrate reduction, and internal alkalinity consumption by ammonium assimilation. Calibration of the model was accomplished using <b>ion</b> <b>budget</b> data obtained from studies on 14 softwater lakes in diverse geographic areas. Rate coefficients generally are similar among softwater lakes: kSO 4,, = 0. 5 m/yr; kNO 3. = 1. 3 yr- 1; kNH 4 + = 1. 5 yr. -t. Sensitivity analysis showed that predicted alkalinity is sensitive to water residence times but not very sensitive to moderate changes in rate coefficient values. According to the model, IAG is important in regulating the alkalinity of lakes with water residence times greater than about 2 years. The model reflects the homeostatic nature of IAG: the process increases with increasing inputs of HNO 3. or H 2 SO 4 and decreases as loadings of these acids decrease.

40|$|In the Vosges Mountains (NE of France), {{integrated}} plot-catchment {{studies have}} been carried out since 1985 in the Strengbach basin to study the influence of acid atmospheric inputs on surface water quality and element budgets. In this paper, available mid-term time series (1985 – 1991) have been considered to detect obvious trends, if any, in surface water chemistry and element budgets. Air quality data showed a slight decline for SO 2, whereas NO 2 slightly increased over the period, but these trends are not very significant. This is in agreement with increased N concentration (mainly as NH 4 +) and with the stability of SO 4 2 – in open field precipitation. Because of a significant decrease in rainfall amount over the period, only inputs of NH 4 + increased significantly whereas H+ and SO 4 2 + inputs declined. In spring and streamwaters, pH and dissolved Si concentration increased mainly {{as a result of a}} reduced flow. Na+, K+, Cl– and HCO- 3 ~– concentrations remained stable whereas Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and SO 4 2 + concentrations declined significantly. Only NO 3 – concentration increased significantly in springwaters. The catchment budgets revealed significant losses of base cations, Si and SO 4 2 –. These losses decreased over the period. Nitrogen was retained in the ecosystem. However, a longer record is needed to determine whether or not changes in surface water chemistry have resulted from short-term flow reductions or long-term changes in input-output <b>ion</b> <b>budgets.</b> This is specially true with N because the decline in SO 4 2 – output was accompanied by N accumulation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the data collected}} {{within the framework of}} an Observatory of Research in Environment on the Amazonian Basin-the ORE HYBAM. It relates to the dissolved and solid loads of the two main rivers of French Guiana, the Maroni and Oyapock rivers, running on the Guiana Shield and draining respectively 64 230 and 24 630 km(2). The low coefficient of variation of the average annual flows of the two rivers indicates an inter-annual hydrological stability probably related to the immediate vicinity of the Atlantic Ocean. The sedimentary load is mainly composed of quartz and kaolinite. The total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations are among the world's lowest values; they range from 1 to 130 mg l(- 1) during the hydrological cycle, with averages of 22 and 12 mg l(- 1), for the Maroni and Oyapock rivers, respectively. The seasonal variability of these values is significantly higher than that of hydrologic flows, but without simple relationship with the discharge. Water chemical composition of the two rivers indicates a very weak mineralization, very similar to that found in the Amazonian rivers running on the Brazilian and Guianese shields, and in the Congo River and its tributaries in the Central African Shield. Seasonal variations are observed in both basins; they correspond to higher concentrations during low water stage (from October to February) and to more diluted water during the flood, from April to July. A signature enriched in Cl- is present at the Saut Maripa station on the Oyapock River indicating a more marked influence of the trade winds in this basin.

40|$|Biological, {{geological}} and hydrological drivers collectively control forest biogeochemical cycling. However, {{based on}} a close examination of recent literature, we argue {{that the role of}} hydrological control particularly precipitation on nutrient budgets is significantly underestimated in subtropical and tropical forests, hindering our predictions of future forest nutrient status under a changing climate in these systems. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed two decades of monthly nutrient input and output data in precipitation and streamwater from a subtropical forested watershed in Taiwan, one of the few sites that has long-term nutrient input-output data in the tropics and subtropics. The results showed that monthly input and output of all <b>ions</b> and <b>budgets</b> (output – input) of most ions were positively correlated with precipitation quantity and there was a surprisingly greater net ion export during the wet growing season, indicating strong precipitation control on the nutrient budget. The strong precipitation control is also supported by the divergence of acidic precipitation and near neutral acidity of streamwater, with the former being independent from precipitation quantity but the latter being positively related to precipitation quantity. An additional synthesis of annual precipitation quantity and nutrient budgets of 32 forests across the globe showed a strong correlation between precipitation quantity and nutrient output-input budget, indicating that strong precipitation control is ubiquitous at the global scale and is particularly important in the humid tropical and subtropical forests. Our results imply that climate change could directly affect ecosystem nutrient cycling in the tropics through changes in precipitation pattern and amount...|$|R

P. damicornis acquired ammonium at rates of between 5. 1 and 91. 8 nmol N cm(- 2) h(- 1) which were not affected by nutrient treatment except {{in the case of}} one morph. In this case, uptake rates decreased from 80. 5 to 42. 8 nmol cm(- 2) h(- 1) (P < 0. 05) on exposure to elevated ammonium over 12 mo. The presence or absence of light during measurement did not influence the uptake of ammonium <b>ions.</b> Nitrogen <b>budgets</b> revealed that the uptake of ammonium from concentrations of 0. 11 to 0. 13 mu M could completely satisfy the demand of growing P. damicornis for new nitrogen. P. damicornis also took up DFAAs at rates ranging from 4. 9 to 9. 8 nmol N cm(- 2) h(- 1). These rates were higher in the dark than in the light (9. 0 vs 5. 1 nmol m(- 2) h(- 1), P < 0. 001).
