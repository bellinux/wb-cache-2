5000|$|On 18 September {{there was}} another {{incident}} of the same type as in 1925 when a driver overshot the buffers {{and ran into the}} station offices, killing the assistant station master. Once again the driver was not familiar with the new type of brakes that had been introduced with the new train stock - this time 1951 <b>electro</b> <b>pneumatic</b> brake electric multiple units. [...] The report notes that the 4EPB units had been gradually introduced from 1951 and that all trains on the line were at that point of this type. The train was the 3:12 pm from Waterloo which stopped at Wimbledon, Surbiton and then all stations down the branch line. It arrived at Guildford at 4:0 pm (sic, and standard terminology at the time for 4:00 pm or 16:00). (Note the scheduled arrival time would have been 4:04 pm which accords more with the statement in the report that fire engines arrived within 4 minutes and the first ambulance at 4:10, but in any case this is not relevant to the accident as excessive speed was not considered as a cause).|$|E
50|$|The {{church was}} {{subsequently}} without an organ {{for more than}} a century and a quarter during Puritan days, until Christian Smith was engaged to build one in 1717. Some of Smith's pipes still survive in the present instrument but, over the years, various builders have had a hand in its development, namely Nicholls, Hill, Bishop, Brindley, Norman & Beard and Henry Willis. The last major rebuild was in 1940 by Harrison & Harrison of Durham. In 1987, Harrisons carried out a restoration making some slight tonal changes and taking advantage of modern solid-state technology to increase the facilities. In April 2007, they carried out some routine maintenance and cleaning, and up-graded the combination capture system to include 64 separate channels. The number of general pistons was increased from three to eight. It has three manuals and pedals, with 41 speaking stops and 12 couplers. The action is <b>electro</b> <b>pneumatic.</b> The Chamber Organ is a ‘Premier’ model built by the firm of Cousans (Lincoln) Ltd in the 1960s. It is used for more intimate choral performances, where the main organ is not always appropriate, and with an orchestra, as a continuo organ.|$|E

The latter depot was closed in 1990 {{and has been}} refurbished as a servicing centre for track maintenance Multiple Purpose Vehicles (MPV) for AMEC SPIE and Railtrack. From electrification to the early 1960s train stock was formed of 3 and latterly 4 car 3-SUB and 4-SUB units. In the early 1940s a new 4-SUB was introduced, as shown in this photo by the Southern Railways Group. Subsequently, following World War 2, {{a large number of}} a sleeker design of 4-SUB was made as shown by Hart and Law. For a while in the late 1950s and 1960s the line was the only route from Waterloo that had 4-SUB units substituted by EPB units. For many years new train stock was tested for long periods on this route. New mainline 4LAV units were tried out in public service in the spring of 1932 on the Waterloo - Cobham - Guildford route, where the best known publicity shot was taken of an unidentifiable unit carrying headcode H with a bar above. The line received the first post-World War 2 EPB (<b>Electro</b> <b>Pneumatic</b> Brake) electric stock that became the standard for British Railways Southern Region for many years. In January 1952, 4EPB set number 5001 entered service on the line. One of the new {{electric train}}s in the 1950s is illustrated in (Sep 1959 The Railway Magazine).|$|E

40|$|Abstract––Milling is a {{metal removal}} process {{by means of}} using a {{rotating}} cutter having one or more cutting teeth. A milling machine is a machine tool used to machine solid materials. Milling machines are often classed in two basic forms horizontal and vertical. This refers to {{the orientation of the}} main spindle. At all types of milling machines, the cutting tool performs a rotational motion that is the cutting motion. The rotation axis of the tool could be horizontal or vertical, depending on machine tool version. The feeding motion is achieved either by part or tool, or both; usually on three perpendicular directions. Milling machine is automated using <b>Electro</b> <b>pneumatic</b> system.

40|$|Abstract:- Now a days as the {{industries}} are developing rapidly, man power reduces gradually in industries. In olden days almost all industries uses conventional machines for manufacturing processes. In conventional machining processes, the time consumption is very high, labour cost {{is high and}} which increases the manufacturing cost of the product. The accuracy is also not achieved as per the design requirements. To overcome all these difficulties, {{the industries}} are made automated through some devices such as electronic components, pneumatic device electrical equipments etc. For producing economically better quality products with high productivity, accuracy and quality, the conventional machine tools are being replaced gradually by the automated machine tool devices. Automation of the machines are made with help of Pneumatic device, Sensors, Mechatronics, and PLCs etc. Here the efforts are made to develop a <b>electro</b> <b>pneumatic</b> circuit for a shaping operations using a shaper machine. This makes the operations semi automatic producing shaping operations by a single point cutting tool. The three movements of the shaper are a) The reciprocating movement of the ram. b) The Crosswise movement of the tool lead across the cross rail. c) The vertical up and down movement of the table. The above movements are being automated using electropneumatic components such as pneumatic cylinders, direction control valves, flow control valves and other electrical and electronics devices. For automation of the shaper, an electropneumatic circuit is developed {{with the help of}} sensors, solenoids, electrical and electronic devices.

40|$|Environmental Control System (ECS) or Air Management System is {{a generic}} term used in {{aircraft}} industry for system and equipment associated with cooling, heating, ventilation, humidity/contaminant control and pressurization within aircraft occupied compartments, cargo compartments and electronic equipment bays. It also caters to other pneumatic demands like windshield demisting, aerofoil anti-icing, door-sealing, fuel-tank pressurization and engine bay ventilation. The real challenge for an ECS is to operate and supply adequate cooling {{over a wide}} range of ground and flight conditions in a most reliable and efficient manner. Ventilation to the cabin is normally through Environmental Control System (ECS), emergency back-up pressurization system and by ram air. Engines bleed air is used by the environmental control system to provide pressurization to the cabin. Refrigeration of the air is produced by a single bootstrap air cycle system (Air Conditioning Pack). The bleed air temperature control is accomplished automatically by an electronic controller in conjunction with an <b>Electro</b> <b>Pneumatic</b> Temperature Control Valve (TCV). This system is designed to maintain the cabin and crew compartment temperature in the range of 18 to 30 °C up to the aircraft ceiling of altitude of 30, 000 ft. This paper covers the system performance evaluation carried out for various engine power settings during ground tests on the aircraft and by empirical method. Further, instrumentation scheme adapted for measuring pressure and temperature for the above said evaluation has been discussed. Results of the tests show that the required mass flow rate and condition of the air entering in to the cabin is met, thus ECS performance is satisfactory. ...|$|E
40|$|An Automated Electro-Pneumatic Soil Sampling (EP) method {{based on}} {{pressurized}} air for real time soil analysis {{was developed and}} tested in laboratory conditions. Pressurized air was applied for 36 milliseconds across a 3 cm diameter cylinder to cut a soil column and convey soil along a delivery pipe into a container. An electro-pneumatic regulator valve was used to regulate the air pressure at 550, 690, and 830 kPa using an analog electrical signal. A two-position solenoid valve controlled by a stand-alone microprocessor was used to control pulse duration. The effects of air pressure level, soil moisture content, soil compaction, and soil type on the quantity of soil sample obtained were investigated. Moisture content and pressure level {{were found to be}} the most significant factors, while compaction was not significant in terms of mass of soil obtained. Laboratory test results showed that pressurized air was effective in cutting and transporting soil sample for all different soils and different soil conditions studied in the experiment. The electro-pneumatic method was also capable of obtaining a consistent amount of soil sample in a short time period (36 ms) with a coefficient of variation of less than 30 %.;A shank as soil sampling arm was designed and constructed. The EP system was integrated with the prototype of soil sampling shank to develop a complete Real-Time <b>Electro</b> <b>Pneumatic</b> Soil Sampling System (REPS). The performance of the REPS system was tested during preliminary field tests, and performance was evaluated in a soil bin. The effects of traveling speed, soil moisture content, and pulse duration and pressure level on the amount of soil sample collected were investigated. All the factors in the experimental design were found to be highly significant (alpha= 0. 05) on the amount of soil sample obtained. The amount of sample were predicted with a high correlation coefficient (R 2 = 86) for all different soil moisture content. The REPS could be a strong candidate for real-time soil sensing system...|$|E
