40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the thermal damage in dental {{implants}} after irradiations with a 980 nm diode laser, normally used for the decontamination. Material and Methods: Five Titanium Plasma Sprayed dental implants were irradiated with a 980 nm diode laser at different parameters. Temperature increase on implant surface was evaluated by a Mid-Wavelength Infrared thermal-camera (Merlin®, FLIR, USA). Temperature increase (ΔT) was compared to environmental temperature (27 °C) and recorded in three points: “A” (laser spot), “B” (3 mm apically to the laser spot) and “C” (2 mm horizontally to the laser spot). Finally, a morphological evaluation at optical stereomicroscopy was performed. Results: When 0. 6 W power was applied, a moderate increase of temperature in point A (5. 5 °C- 15. 0 °C), a slight increase <b>in</b> <b>point</b> <b>B</b> (0. 1 °C- 6. 2 °C) and point C (0. 1 °C- 5. 7 °C), were registered after 30 ” of irradiation. In the samples treated at 6 W, in “point A” an impressive ΔT increase was immediately recorded (over 70 °C). In “point B” was recorded a slight ΔT after 2 sec. irradiation (range 2. 3 °C- 6. 0 °C), a moderate ΔT after 4 sec. irradiation (16. 4 °C) and a consistent ΔT after 8 - 10 sec. irradiation (range 36. 6 °C- 46. 2 °C). In “point C” ΔT values were very similar to those collected in “point B”. Optical stereomicroscopy examination at a magnification of 32 x did not show any surface alteration or damage after whichever laser irradiation independently from irradiation time and power output. Conclusions: 980 nm diode laser, used at controlled parameters, can be used in the decontamination of dental implants, without causing any thermal damage or increase. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to conduct a {{long-term}} follow-up investigation of the stability of hard and soft tissues after bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) with rigid internal (RIF) fixation to advance the mandible. Sixteen consecutive patients (12 females and 4 males, mean age 21. 4 years) were available for re-examination 12. 7 years (T 5) after surgery. The preceding follow-ups were before (T 1), and 5 days (T 2), 7. 3 months (T 3), and 13. 9 months (T 4) after surgery. Lateral cephalograms were traced by hand, digitized, and evaluated with the Dentofacial Planner program. The x-axis for the system of co-ordinates ran through sella (point zero) and the line NSL - 7 degrees. Thus, the program determined the x- and y-values of each variable and the usual angles and distances. Statistical analysis was carried out using Wilcoxon's matched-pair signed-ranks test with Bonferroni adjustments. The relationships between the examined variables were analysed by Spearman rank correlation coefficients. The backward relapse at point B (T 5) was 2. 42 mm, or 50 per cent, and at pogonion 3. 21 mm, or 60 per cent of the initial advancement. The mean net effect at T 5 on the labial fold (soft tissue point B) was 94 per cent of the advancement at point B. For the soft tissue chin (soft tissue pogonion), it was 119 per cent of the advancement at pogonion.

40|$|Language is a {{means of}} communication. Communication takes place not only with two or more speakers, but also between a speaker and a text. There should be a kind of {{interaction}} between the learner (reader) and the text which is being read in order to be good readers. Reading is a necessary skill that any learner needs. Unfortunately, how to teach reading has not been given due care in some schools. In the past, according to the traditional view, reading begins with the child's mastering the names of the letters, mastering the letter-sound relationships, then, learning some easy words in isolation, and, finally, reading simple stories with highly controlled vocabularies (Harp and Brewer, 1996 : 17). Researchers and teachers as well complain that most learners are not able to understand what they read. Reading cannot be separated from comprehension. That is why there appear a lot of problems dealing with reading comprehension. Many English learners find it difficult to understand the English text. Very often, they get stuck because of some problems, such as unfamiliar words, their inability in understanding the context, being reluctant, and so forth. Reading is not an easy skill to master. It is a complex process that requires specialized skill of the reader (Dechant, 1977 : 21). Besides, it is also comprehension process as well as writing. According to Nunan (1998 : 33), reading needs identification and also interpretation processes which require the reader’s knowledge about the language structure used in the text and his knowledge about a given topic. It is the complexity that makes some students less interested in this kind of activity. They find it difficult to understand what is on the reading passage since they do not know the technique which can help them to read more effectively and efficiently. This phenomenon happens in almost every language class. Reading comprehension skills separate the "passive" unskilled readers from the "active" readers. Skilled readers do not just read, they interact with the text. Skilled readers, for instance, predict what will happen next in a story using clues presented in text, create questions about the main idea, message, or plot of the text, and monitor understanding of the sequence, context, or characters (Sanders, 2001 : 26). To be able to achieve the purposes of reading comprehension, one should have some basic reading skills as follows; (1) literal skills (getting the central thought and main idea, recalling and recognizing of facts and information, finding answer to specific questions); (2) interpretive skills (drawing conclusions, generalizing, deriving meaning from context); (3) critical skill (determining the writer’s purpose); and (4) creative skills (applying information into daily life). Based on the preliminary observation on the teaching-learning process in SMP Negeri 1 Sine, the writer found that there are some problems that arise in students’ reading comprehension. The students still encounter some difficulties in comprehending English texts. In the interview with some students, they said that they got difficulties in identifying the implicit and explicit information of the text. Besides, many students have low motivation in reading class. The students’ lack of understanding on reading lesson is mainly caused by an inappropriate teaching technique used when the teachers attempted to explain reading materials. The teacher only uses one technique namely, conventional technique. In the reading class, the teacher presents a subject in the text book and asks students to read whether silently or loudly, and then students have to answer the questions that follow. Consequently, the reading lesson becomes monotonous and boring, students lack motivation to read, even if they read, they show negative attitudes. As a result, the students are not able to get good scores in their reading achievement. Permendiknas no. 24, 2006 at seventh article <b>in</b> <b>point</b> <b>b</b> states that the teachers under Badan Penelitian dan Pengembangan Departemen Pendidikan Nasional can develop KTSP curriculum innovatively. It means that the teacher has the right in using method or technique in a teaching process as long as the technique can achieve instructional goals. The teacher {{has to be able to}} make an interesting material and to use an interesting technique. One of the ways that may have a significant impact on the teaching reading process is the semantic mapping strategy. Semantic mapping strategy can be used for, at least, several different instructional purposes. This strategy can assist teachers in planning the instruction by helping them identify the patterns of organization of ideas and the concepts. A semantic mapping strategy can be useful for introducing the important vocabulary in a selection to be read. It shows students how the terms are interrelated. Teachers can use a semantic mapping to activate and tap student's background knowledge. Also, it can be a helpful reference for students to use in clarifying confusing points as they are reading. Once students are familiar with the nature of the semantic mapping strategy, they can create their own mapping during-reading or post-reading activity. Steps in the creation of semantic mapping strategy, particularly; the concept and word mapping strategies are: Analyze the concepts and vocabulary in the text. Arrange the words in a map that depicts the interrelationships between the concepts. Add to the diagram the words or concepts that are already understood by the students in order to depict the relationships between what they know and the information in the text. The semantic mapping strategy or Structured Overview, as it is sometimes called, is a schematic diagram of the major concepts in a portion of text. The researcher of this study uses the semantic mapping strategy in teaching reading at SMPN 1 Sine because it can develop the students’ thinking skills and reading comprehension. This strategy can easily be taught and implemented for the students. The researcher believes that semantic mapping strategy can improve the students’ reading comprehension...|$|E
