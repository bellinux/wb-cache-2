Thus, a bank can make loans over a long horizon, while keeping only relatively small amounts of cash on hand to pay any depositors that wish to make withdrawals.

We construct a model, under reasonable assumptions, with deposit insurance where banks undertake excessive risk - moral hazard risk.

Our findings indicate that banks subject to the moral hazard behaviour show significant increases in foreign exchange position risk and deterioration in capital adequacy relative to their benchmark after introduction of <b>full</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance system. We relate this excessive risk-taking to the moral hazard behaviour by commercial banks. The research results indicate that complete deposit insurance system distorts the incentive structure of commercial banks and thus, prevents proper functioning of market discipline mechanism and leads to the taking excessive risk-taking. ...|$|E

We find that lower entry costs foster competition in deposit rates and reduce banks’ incentives to limit risk exposure. While higher insurance coverage amplifies this effect, two alternative arrangements (risk based contributions to the deposit insurance fund, and public disclosure of financial information) contribute to reduce it. Moreover, uninsured but fully informed depositors and risk based <b>full</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance yield the same, entry cost independent, equilibrium risk level.

In this thesis, issues relating to the diagnosis and prognosis of SLE were studied, focussing on the application of histopathologic evaluation in conjunction with clinical features {{in the setting of}} lupus nephritis (LN) and neuropsychiatric SLE (NP-SLE). In the first part, we demonstrated that classification criteria for SLE cannot be unequivocally applied to patients from nephrology clinics who present with <b>full</b> house glomerular <b>deposits</b> suggestive of LN/SLE.

Next, we identified prognosticators that may add to the current histopathologic classification of LN.

The problem can at times become {{so severe that}} the current regulatory framework – based {{on a combination of}} effectively <b>full</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance, minimum capital requirements and prudential supervision – proves inadequate for mitigating the moral hazard. Against this background, consideration is given to the question of how, and at what cost, an increase in market discipline would improve incentives. Finally, the additional microeconomic incentive effects of lender of last resort (LOLR) arrangements in the various alternatives is discussed. In conclusion, it is argued that LOLR arrangements in which the terms of liquidity support depend on the bank’s risk profile can be effective in improving the bank’s incentives to make the desired risk choice in the first place. central bank, liquidity provision, lender of last resort, moral hazard...|$|E
40|$|Summary Turkey {{experienced}} a massive banking crisis in February 2001, {{resulting in the}} loss of more than a thousand managerial jobs and the closure of 21 % of all bank branches in the market. In this paper, we study the behavior of the market and the banks in Turkey before the crisis, from 1988 to 2000, which includes the period of <b>full</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance. The empirical results showed that not only depositors but also borrowers reacted negatively to risky banks and punished them even more during the period of generous government guarantee. However, in the same period, banks were found to increase their moral hazard behavior significantly. Although the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank recommend explicit deposit insurance for developing countries, the findings of this paper suggest that deposit insurance may not be an effective policy tool to improve market confidence, and it does not guarantee a stable economic environment even when the market reacts negatively to the moral hazard behavior of banks. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{tests the}} {{possibility}} {{and the degree}} of persistence of self-fulfilling banking panics through an experimental protocol. It confirms the possibility of pure-panic bank runs as first formalized by Diamond and Dybvig (1983) where all participants panic. However, this situation remains rare as Temzelides (1997) found out in an evolutionary game framework. But self-fulfilling bank runs, with a marked loss of confidence between depositors, are the most frequent cases in the experiment. This supports the idea of strong coordination failures as observed in the experimental literature on coordination games. Panics are proved to be persistent phenomena which are difficult to prevent. However, it seems to be possible to curb them through a learning effect caused by a temporary but long enough suspension of the deposit availability, combined to a “narrow banking solution” which makes banks more liquid. Lastly, panic prevention requires a <b>full</b> <b>deposit</b> coverage to be effective. Even a 75 % deposit coverage rate is not sufficient, while lowering the coverage rate to 25 % leads to more severe bank runs. This suggests that the moral hazard issue should not be tackled through a lower deposit coverage, especially in emerging countries' banking systems where depositors are likely to lose confidenc...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a financial intermediation model integrating both loan and deposit markets {{to study the}} impacts of competition on bank risk-taking behavior under different coverage of deposit insurance. We find {{that the relationship between}} competition and bank risk-taking depends on the interactions of market structure between loan and deposit markets, deposit insurance, and depositors ’ risk aversion. With <b>full</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance coverage, an increase only in competition for deposit will trigger severe bank moral hazard problem and spill over to loan market because of the existence of bank’s role on financial intermediation. Thus there exists a positive relationship between competition and bank risk-taking. In contrast, an increase only in competition for loan could lower bank risk. There exists a negative relationship between competition and bank risk-taking. Without deposit insurance, in general, bank risk will be contained due to depositors ’ risk internalization. The risk could be even lower in monopolistic deposit market and competitive loan market than other loan and deposit market structure combinations due to no existence of any moral hazard problem. In the other loan and deposit market structure combinations, risk will be higher due to moral hazard either in loan market or in deposit market. We also find that depositors ’ risk aversion under information disclosure could induce lower bank risk when deposits are competitive...|$|E
40|$|The {{far-reaching}} liberalization process {{introduced in}} Chile after {{the overthrow of}} the Allende regime first met with reasonable success, but in the early 1980 s a foreign-exchange crisis and a banking crisis appeared to mark the end of the experiment. Liberalization was resumed in 1985 and has not been plagued by serious crises since. The root of the problem seems to have been an exchange rate policy which had to be abandoned, but not before it had led economic actors to make the wrong decisions. The lack of prudential supervision of the financial system did the rest. So far, Indonesia has been following much more cautious exchange rate policies in its liberalization drive. Crises on the scale experienced by Chile are not very likely to occur. The lessons provided by the lack of prudential supervision in Chile do not, however, seem to have been taken to heart, or not sufficiently. Even if the Indonesian banks are unlikely to suffer as much as their Chilean opposite numbers from foreign exchange risks, bad loans, in particular resulting from intra-conglomerate lending, are an increasingly serious prohlem. In dealing with troubled banks the Indonesian authorities have not repeated the mistake of the Chileans to provide a <b>full</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantee. Nonetheless, excellent though the banking rules may look on paper, the implementation leaves much to be desired and Indonesia probably has not yet seen the end of its banking troubles. Apparently, market imperfections are such that effective prudential supervision cannot be dispensed with. Also, it appears that low capital-asset ratios in both banks and their clients, as in Chile in the mid- 1970 s, call for a cautious course in liberalization.
