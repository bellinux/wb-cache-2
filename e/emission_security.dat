This paper investigates the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) for functional safety and <b>emission</b> <b>security</b> on computer systems. Initially, the EMC security issues for the electromagnetic emission of computer systems {{as well as the}} susceptibility of tremendously increased critical circuits are presented. Then, impact of electromagnetic security in ubiquitous applications based on computer technology is discussed, which encompasses the damage of E 3 and risk potential, CE security limits and experiment example of TEMPEST. Finally, the protection means of computer electromagnetic security are provided. The paper states the need for the guidelines on controlling EMC and the process of CE to achieve electromagnetic security of computer systems.

40|$|Abstract. Nearly half {{a century}} ago, {{military}} organizations introduced “Tempest ” emission-security test standards to control information leakage from unintentional electromagnetic emanations of digital electronics. The nature of these emissions has changed with evolving technology; electromechanic devices have vanished and signal frequencies increased several orders of magnitude. Recently published eavesdropping attacks on modern flat-panel displays and cryptographic coprocessors demonstrate that the risk remains acute for applications with high protection requirements. The ultra-wideband signal processing technology needed for practical attacks finds already its way into consumer electronics. Current civilian RFI limits are entirely unsuited for <b>emission</b> <b>security</b> purposes. Only an openly available set of test standards based on published criteria will help civilian vendors and users to estimate and manage emission-security risks appropriately. This paper outlines a proposal and rationale for civilian electromagnetic emission-security limits. While the presented discussion aims specifically at far-field video eavesdropping in the VHF and UHF bands, the most easy to demonstrate risk, much of the presented approach for setting test limits could be adapted equally to address other RF emanation risks...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{challenges}} in shrimp cultivation are the intensive electricity consumptions with associated greenhouse gases <b>emissions,</b> <b>security</b> of power supply, and environmental impact from the discharged waste water. Following Thailand energy roadmap, the renewable energy share in power production sector is targeted to be increased, for energy security {{and climate change}} mitigation. This paper evaluates six different scenarios of renewable energy implementation for shrimp farm in Thailand. The {{results show that the}} system with solar PV has higher reliability compared to the one with wind turbine at equal life cycle cost. The reliability of the system with solar PV and solar PV with battery varies significantly with the life cycle cost at low cost range then becomes stable. On the other hand, it was found to be quite stable in the cases of wind turbine with and without battery. Adding battery to the system significantly increases the reliability of solar PV and slightly increases for wind turbine. At the life cycle cost lower than $ 1 million, maximum reliability of the system with solar PV is around 53 %. By adding battery, the reliability of the system can be up to 90 %. The different magnitudes of the reliability between these two scenarios are higher at higher life cycle cost. For this case study, to reach higher than 50 % reliability, the recommended renewable alternative is solar PV with battery...|$|R
