5|$|After pushing Max away, Donna finally invites him to {{the club}} to see her perform. When he arrives she {{performs}} a set, speaking about how she is pregnant and planning to have an abortion. Max leaves, but {{on the day of}} Donna's abortion, he arrives at her home with flowers and asks if he can accompany her to her procedure. While at the clinic he tells her he supports her, and that when he said {{that he wanted to be}} a grandfather, he meant sometime far in the future. The two agree that this is one of the nicest Valentine's Days they <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had.</b> After the abortion, Max takes Donna to his home where he makes her tea, and then they watch Gone with the Wind together.|$|E
5|$|Stigma is {{commonly}} experienced, around the world, {{by those with}} epilepsy. It can affect people economically, socially and culturally. In India and China, epilepsy {{may be used as}} justification to deny marriage. People in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed. In Tanzania, as in other parts of Africa, epilepsy is associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious, {{for which there is no}} evidence. Before 1970 the United Kingdom had laws which prevented people with epilepsy from marrying. The stigma may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> seizures.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{basketball}} {{players have been}} successful in professional basketball. Fifty-eight have been drafted into the National Basketball Association (NBA); twenty-six of those were first round draft picks, including both Cazzie Russell and Chris Webber who were drafted first overall. The 1990 NBA Draft in which Rumeal Robinson was selected 10th, Loy Vaught was selected 13th, and Terry Mills was selected 16th made Michigan the third of only ten schools that <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> three or more players selected {{in the first round of}} the same draft. Five players have gone on to become NBA champions for a total of nine times and eight players have become NBA All-Stars a total of 18 times. Rudy Tomjanovich coached both the 1994 and 1995 NBA Finals Champions. Not only has Glen Rice won both an NBA and NCAA championship, he is also one of only nine {{basketball players}} to have won a state high school championship, NCAA title and NBA championship.|$|E

25|$|Determining {{the number}} of men who <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> sex with another man is {{difficult}} worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that at least 3% and as high as 16% of men have had sex at least once with a man. Their estimate includes victims of sexual abuse in addition to men who regularly or voluntarily have sex with men. The United Nations estimates that 6-20% of men worldwide have sex with other men at some point during their lifetime.|$|E

The 1988 story Silver Nemesis was broadcast with all three episodes airing back to back on TVNZ in New Zealand in November, after the first episode had been shown in the UK but before the final two instalments had aired there. Finally, the 1996 television film premiered on 12 May 1996 on CITV in Edmonton, Canada, 15 days before the BBC One showing, and two days before it aired on Fox in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{abstinence}} is {{the practice}} of refraining from some or all aspects of sexual activity for medical, psychological, legal, social, financial, philosophical, moral or religious reasons. For the last twenty years, abstinence rates among American adolescents have risen. The percentage {{of high school students}} in the US who reported that they <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> sexual intercourse dropped from 54.1% in 1991 to 47.8% in 2007 and to 43% in 2011. A cross-sectional survey in 1998 found that fear of pregnancy was the most commonly cited reason for choosing abstinence, especially among girls, as well as boys who had caused a pregnancy in the past. Other reasons included a fear of sexually transmitted infections, a lack of desire, being afraid of getting caught, and the belief that sex was not appropriate for someone of their age.|$|E

25|$|One {{study from}} 1996 {{documented}} the interviews {{of a sample}} of junior {{high school students in}} the United States. The girls were less likely to state that they ever had sex than adolescent boys. Among boys and girls who had experienced sexual intercourse, the proportion of girls and boys who had recently had sex and were regularly sexually active was the same. Those conducting the study speculated that fewer girls say they <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> sex because girls viewed teenage parenthood as more of a problem than boys. Girls were thought to be more restricted in their sexual attitudes; they were more likely than boys to believe that {{they would be able to}} control their sexual urges. Girls had a more negative association in how being sexually active could affect their future goals. In general, girls said they felt less pressure from peers to begin having sex, while boys reported feeling more pressure.|$|E
25|$|Edgar {{began playing}} {{regularly}} in the academy and made his debut for the reserve team on April 10, 2003 against Bradford City. He made his debut for the Canada under-20 team on October 15, 2003, (just three months after first appearing at under-17 level), against Panama at the Torneo Mondialito, aged 16. The following month, he was named in the Canada squad for the World Youth Championships, {{that took place in}} the UAE. Edgar was an unused substitute in each of Canada's matches, as they finished third in their group. In June 2005, Edgar was involved in the competition for a second time, appearing in all three of Canada's matches at the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship in Netherlands. Canada finished bottom of their group. Edgar caught the eye of Spanish club Málaga CF in September 2005 when Newcastle played the La Liga club in a pre-season friendly game. Málaga, as well as a few English clubs, declared an interest in signing him. However, Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd was quick to announce that Edgar was not for sale, and that he had been given a new contract by the club to ward off any further interest. Edgar began making more regular appearances in the reserve team during the 2005–06 season. On May 19, 2006, while celebrating his nineteenth birthday, he played and scored in the Canadian Under-20 side's 2–1 victory over the Brazilian Under-20 side. This was the first victory Canada <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> over Brazil in any level of men's soccer.|$|E
