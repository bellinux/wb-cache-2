Widen the application range of plastic packages by using advanced polymer materials and optimizing material combinations and interfaces {{could be one}} answer to these requirements. Typical scenario for the integration of electronics into automotive applications is a control unit in the engine compartment, where typical ambient temperatures are around 150 °C, package junction temperatures may range from 175 °C to 200 °C and peak temperature may exceed these values. If low cost packages and technologies as e. g. BGA, QFN, Chip On Board or <b>Flip</b> <b>Chip</b> are used under harsh environment conditions, {{it is clear that}} especially the polymeric materials, i. e. Epoxy Molding Compounds, Die Attach adhesive, underfiller, solder mask or the organic substrate base material, are challenged. Generally the development goal for die attach materials and encapsulants compatible with high temperature applications are materials with high Tg and low degradation even at temperatures > 200 °C. In this paper material analysis is performed to study the material degradation and temperature depending thermo-mechanical and adhesion properties of state-of-the-art as well as new advanced encapsulation materials. Beneath standard degradation analyzing techniques as thermo-gravimetry dielectric spectroscopy is introduced as an analyzing tool for process and package related degradation studies. As an advanced packaging example the high temperature potential of <b>Flip</b> <b>Chip</b> <b>assemblies</b> on low lost substrates is investigated, Typically <b>Flip</b> <b>Chip</b> <b>assemblies</b> are only investigated up to cycling temperatures of 125 °C, sometimes up to 150 °C.

40|$|<b>Flip</b> <b>Chip</b> {{technology}} has been widely accepted within microelectronics as a technology for maximum miniaturization. Typical applications today are mobile products as cellular phones or GPS devices. For these consumer applications upper temperature limits and reliability demands are not very harsh. To widen the application range of <b>Flip</b> <b>Chip</b> technology and to address the volume market of automotive and harsh environment industrial electronics the development of highly reliable assemblies with high temperature capabilities is as crucial as being able to qualify and predict this very reliability. Transfer molding is the standard process for a highly reliable encapsulation of leaded and area array packages as BGAs or CSPs. Advanced materials and process developments now allow the use of transfer molding technology for direct underfilling and / or overmolding of <b>Flip</b> <b>Chip</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Existing standard equipment for encapsulation can be used and no additional process step for underfill dispensing or jetting is required. Molded <b>Flip</b> <b>Chips</b> have the potential of high reliability as the low CTE of the <b>flip</b> <b>chip</b> molding compound reduces the thermal mismatch. Trends of the market drive towards SIPs with an integration of different devices as e. g. SMD and <b>Flip</b> <b>Chip.</b> Therefore the highly reliable encapsulation of these hybrid packages with inhomogeneous topography is the goal. For testing the reliability limits and the determination of failure mechanism of molded <b>Flip</b> <b>Chips</b> a test vehicle has been designed at Fraunhofer IZM. This test vehicle for process evaluation and reliability testing allows the encapsulation and underfilling of a single <b>Flip</b> <b>Chip.</b> Test vehicles were built using lead-free SnAgCu solder on standard FR 4 substrates and different state-of-the-art Epoxy Molding Compounds, Reliability results of molded <b>Flip</b> <b>Chips</b> were compared to results from identical assemblies with standard capillary underfill. Molded <b>Flip</b> <b>Chips</b> showed much higher reliability than packages with capillary underfill. All molded devices passed Moisture Sensitivity Test Jedec Level I and more than 3000 h at 85 degrees C / 85 % relative humidity without any electrical failures and delaminations. Temperature cycling from 55 degrees C up to 125 degrees C revealed an extremely high reliability. Molded <b>Flip</b> <b>Chips</b> passed more than 14. 000 cycles without electrical failures. This is {{more than five times}} higher than standard <b>Flip</b> <b>Chips</b> <b>assemblies</b> on FR 4 may withstand. Nondestructive and destructive analysis showed that the main failure mechanisms were starting cracks in the moldcap propagating into the die and causing there an electrical failure. The experimental reliability investigations were backed by thermo-mechanical simulations. For that purpose a Finite Element model was created including the measured material data for the used materials. As failure criterion the inelastic accumulated creep strain in the solder bumps was used within a Coffin-Manson approach. It was found, that the simulations could account for the extreme lifetime of the <b>Flip</b> <b>Chip</b> <b>assemblies</b> and a thermo-mechanical explanation could be given based on the favorable stress distribution generated by the encapsulation. However, there is a shift in failure mechanism away from solder fatigue to encapsulation cracking. This is also underpinned by simulation.

Repair issues due to intrinsically defective dies, having passed standard electrical tests but no burn-in, tend to challenge the cost and performance benefits of bare die attach. Testing and burning-in of bare, unpackaged dies (yielding so called "Known Good Dies") requires sophisticated test equipment while providing only low throughput. Over the last decade, a number of wafer level bum in concepts have evolved, {{the majority of them}} focusing on IC's dedicated for wirebond use. Only few of them found their way into production so far. <b>Flip</b> <b>Chip</b> now requires a different approach, as the dies are not to be tested before, but after bumping. Test equipment and - processes do not lend themselves readily to this task. This paper presents a novel concept for wafer level burn in dedicated for the special need s of <b>flip</b> <b>chips.</b> Using a reusable burn-in substrate, only one step is needed to realize the electrical contacts for the burn in for wafers and the bumps for the <b>flip</b> <b>chip.</b> The technology developed is described and the identified issues are explained. Reliability tests of the burnt-in dice are given and compared to <b>flip</b> <b>chips</b> manufactured with standard bumping methods...|$|R
40|$|This is journal {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Thermal Stresses [© Taylor & Francis] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] paper presents the study of non-uniform temperature distributions in a <b>flip</b> <b>chip</b> electronic <b>assembly,</b> and the use of these temperature distributions to analyse the thermal stresses in lead-free solder joints in surface mount devices. The thermal stresses in the solder joints are mainly due to the mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansions between the component and substrate materials, and temperature gradient in the electronic assembly. The thermo-elasto-visco-plastic finite element analysis is carried out to investigate the extent of thermal stresses induced in solder joints between a surface mount component and a FR 4 circuit board (substrate) under conditions of thermal cycling with the chip resistor operating at its full power condition. Three different cases of spatial temperature distributions are considered including one with an experimentally obtained non-uniform temperature distribution. A comparative study of thermal stresses is performed using a near-eutectic SnAgCu solder material for three different thermal cases...|$|R
40|$|Solder joint is {{a method}} widely used to attach {{electronic}} chip on substrate. It is a generally knowledge that solder joint contains inter-metallic compound (IMC) at interconnects of solder bump and copper pads. The magnitude of IMC layer thickness impacts reliability of chip level packages. Extensive experimental investigations are conducted, however complementary numerical {{studies are needed to}} fully characterise the effects of IMC on high temperature reliability of <b>flip</b> <b>chip</b> (FC) <b>assembly.</b> In this work, thermo-mechanical response of FC lead-free solder joints to accelerated temperature cycle (ATC) is investigated using finite element analysis (FEA) code. The ANAND's model is employed to study the inelastic, nonlinear, rate dependent and visco-plastic behaviour of two models of FC 48 D 6. 3 C 457 DC mounted on printed circuit boards (PCBs). While one model consists of conventional joints without IMC, the other is realistic with IMC embedded. In the result analysis based on damage indicators such as induced strain, stress, plastic work and hysteresis, it is found that negative impact of IMC on static structural integrity of solder joint operating at high temperature ambient is nontrivial...|$|R
