He also suggests that the meaning of sodalitas was not changed to mean an illegal <b>electoral</b> <b>group</b> until 59. He is joined by Nisbet (who argues against authenticity) in suggesting that the proscription of Antonius may have had a far more quotidian meaning, such as the selling of property after bankruptcy, than Henderson seems to be reading into it. Richardson finally notes that the First Catilinarian Conspiracy is not mentioned until In Toga Candida, and as such takes its omission as proof of authenticity.|$|E
40|$|Why do {{different}} countries exhibit different inflation rates? Most political economy accounts emphasise {{the role of}} ideas and institutions: as economic research shows that low inflation is achievable at no economic cost, governments delegate monetary policy to independent central banks.

This conventional wisdom downplays the importance of interests, ignoring the significant influence that a growing <b>electoral</b> <b>group</b> 2 ̆ 014 the elderly 2 ̆ 014 has on inflation. Because the elderly are politically powerful and inflation averse, countries with more elderly citizens force political parties to adopt more economically orthodox policies when in power, resulting in lower inflation rates in those countries.

Numerous studies have been undertaken in Belgium on the link between immigrant associational life and political participation and on the profiles of politicians of immigrant origin, but not yet on party choice and voting patterns among ethnic minority groups. In this article we present the first analysis of voting patterns of ethnic minority groups in Belgium, making use of exit-poll data on the local elections for three municipalities of the Brussels Capital Region. We investigate whether non-EU immigrant origin voters have a particular party preference which cannot be explained by other background variables such as educational level or socio-economic position. We also look into the issue of preferential voting for candidates of immigrant origin. According to the theory on political opportunity structures one would expect a lesser importance of ethnic voting in the Belgian context (in which ethnic mobilisation is discursively discouraged).

40|$|This Article {{frames the}} {{challenges}} to LatCrit theory and activism posed by voting rights, electoral process, and minority politics. In order {{to focus on}} the key challenges, The Article poses this question: What does a LatCrit theorist mean when she proposes to move beyond the 2 ̆ 2 Black-White 2 ̆ 2 paradigm? The Article discusses the changes in the U. S. electorate that in post- 2000 have made the Latina/o and APIA vote the darling of both major parties. In the process of being perceived as an important <b>electoral</b> <b>group,</b> Latinas/os and Asian Pacific Islands Americans are at times being depicted as 2 ̆ 2 model minorities. 2 ̆ 2 The Article concludes that going beyond the Black-White paradigm in this context is to deconstruct the model minority rhetoric, as APIA scholars have done in the affirmative action debate. The Article then discusses, I discuss an important political issue to Latinas/os and APIAs that intersects with civil rights and anti-subordination analysis, the de jure denial of the voting franchise to more than ten million Latinas/os and APIAs because they are noncitizens or are citizens for the sole reason that they reside in Puerto Rico. The Article concludes that thinking beyond the Black-White paradigm in this context requires that LatCrit theorists continue to address this exclusion as both a civil rights and race issue. The Article then reviews the electoral successes of 2002. Even with Latina/o and APIAs 2 ̆ 7 new found electoral influence, their gains in electing representatives to Congress were slim, particularly when compared to their strong population growth of over fifty percent from 1990 to 2000. There are four structural reasons that account for continued lack of influence in congressional representation: representational politics, the politics of redistricting, campaigning in racially polarized environments, and minority voter turnout. Finally, the Article reviews direct democracy ballot where electors in states voted on English-only initiatives, and explains why the direct democracy ballot continues to be a bellweather for racial conflict that requires attuned judicial scrutiny...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} impact of Latinidad in Latino {{political}} participation, especially in regard to voting behavior. Although Latinos often have been portrayed as a decisive <b>electoral</b> <b>group,</b> the reality is they have not fulfilled the expectations imposed upon them. Therefore, I argue Latinos with different levels of group consciousness will engage differently in politics, which affects the voting statistics of the ethnicity in Censuses, reports and surveys. The use of pan-ethnic terms and the constant stereotypes of Latinos all being “the same,” has caused separation rather than cohesiveness within the minority group, which has resulted in low political engagement. I propose that those Latino immigrants and their descendants {{who do not have}} a strong attachment to the pan-ethnicity will behave differently than those who identify themselves in pan-ethnic terms. Consequently, I have come to wonder how Latinidad impacts those who {{are not part of the}} main Latino subgroups —Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans— and have been denominated the “other Latinos” when engaging in politics? South Americans, Central Americans, and Caribbean immigrants have been smashed into a group where they do not occupy a significant place. I suggest that differences in country of origin will have an impact on how Latin American immigrants will participate in American politics. To test my hypothesis, I have made a secondary analysis of existent literature. This analysis includes crosstabulations of data obtained from the 2012 National Survey of Latinos, conducted by the Pew Research Center. Through the analysis of the data and the existent literature, I have concluded that the pan-ethnic terms are not strongly entrenched in Latino’s regular use of identity. Respondents mostly said to not have a preference for either term, still their vote intention was high. Differences are noticeable among Latinos/Hispanics that have different ancestries, however, these are sometimes stabilized by citizenship. The data proved that the identity categories used for surveys directed at Latinos/Hispanics are not specific enough, given that a considerable percentage of participants were confused about how to classify themselves, which altered the results. This current study will contribute to the work of Latino studies, that for more than 50 years have tried to get to know those who make up the Latino community, by approaching identity and Latino politics from a different perspective. A perspective where those called Latinos/Hispanics can identify themselves instead of being randomly categorized...|$|E

50|$|On 15 May 1955, the Austrian State Treaty was signed, in Article 7 {{of which}} the “rights of the Slovene and Croat minorities” in Austria were regulated. In 1975, the <b>electoral</b> <b>grouping</b> of the Slovene {{national}} group (Unity List) only just failed to gain entry to the state assembly. With the argument that in elections the population should vote for the political parties rather than according to their ethnic allegiance, before the next elections in 1979 the originally single electoral district of Carinthia was divided into four constituencies. The area of settlement of Carinthian Slovenes was divided up and these parts were in turn combined with purely German-speaking parts of the province. In the new constituencies, the Slovene-speaking {{proportion of the population}} was reduced {{in such a way that}} it was no longer possible for the representatives of national minorities to succeed in getting into the state assembly. The Austrian Center for Ethnic Groups and the representatives of Carinthian Slovenes saw in this way of proceeding a successful attempt of gerrymandering in order to reduce the political influence of the Slovene-speaking minority group.|$|R
