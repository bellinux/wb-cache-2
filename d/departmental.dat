5|$|The <b>Departmental</b> Water and Sanitation Plans program {{provides}} such services as planning and harmonizing resources and has regional systems of service provision {{at the level}} of each department of the country. The program was first implemented in four departments which have some of the most difficult conditions: Sucre, Córdoba, Magdalena and La Guajira. The program also aimed to overcome the sector’s fragmentation into many small utilities to benefit from economies of scale. In 2010 30 <b>Departmental</b> Plans were completed and published, covering almost all of the country's 32 departments.|$|E
5|$|Denver is a {{consolidated}} city-county with a mayor elected on {{a nonpartisan}} ballot, a 13-member city council and an auditor. The Denver City Council is elected from 11 districts with two at-large council-members and {{is responsible for}} passing and changing all laws, resolutions, and ordinances, usually after a public hearing, and can also call for misconduct investigations of Denver's <b>departmental</b> officials. All elected officials have four-year terms, with a maximum of three terms. The current mayor is Michael Hancock.|$|E
5|$|During {{his presidential}} campaign, Morales had {{supported}} calls for regional autonomy for Bolivia's departments. As president, {{he changed his}} position, viewing the calls for autonomy – which came from Bolivia's four eastern departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, and Tarija – as {{an attempt by the}} wealthy bourgeoisie living in these regions to preserve their economic position. He nevertheless agreed to a referendum on regional autonomy, held in July 2006; the four eastern departments voted in favor of autonomy, but Bolivia as a whole voted against it by 57.6%. In September, autonomy activists launched strikes and blockades across eastern Bolivia, resulting in violent clashes with MAS activists. In January 2007, clashes in Cochabamba between activist groups led to fatalities, with Morales' government sending in troops to maintain the peace. The left-indigenous activists formed a Revolutionary <b>Departmental</b> Government, but Morales denounced it as illegal and continued to recognise the legitimacy of right-wing <b>departmental</b> head Manfred Reyes Villa.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the reform}} process, the CPV devolved some powers of the party {{secretaries}} to the district-level committees. The party planned to decentralize some duties and responsibilities at <b>departmental</b> and sectoral levels while empowering ward-level party organs by strengthening their role in economic planning, market management and public security, and trying to improve {{the performance of the}} Control Commission and its lower-level bodies. The party leadership tried to make the cumbersome bureaucracy efficient.|$|E
5|$|Empresas Departamentales de Acueducto y Alcantarillado (ACUAS) or <b>Departmental</b> Water and Sewerage Companies were created, {{consisting}} of the departments, the municipalities and INSFOPAL, which took care of managing and maintaining the infrastructure of the member communities. In that way, investment {{at the national level}} was channelled into this important area of public health.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in 1945, the Admiralty gave {{approval}} for Upnor Castle to be used as a <b>Departmental</b> Museum and to be opened to the public. It subsequently underwent a degree of restoration. The castle was scheduled as an Ancient Monument in January 1960 and is currently managed by English Heritage. It remains part of the Crown Estate.|$|E
5|$|He {{then went}} {{through a series of}} jobs, {{including}} employment as a caretaker, a cook for a <b>departmental</b> survey party and as a leading hand at the Canberra incinerator. By 1951 he was almost crippled with osteoarthritis, and soon after was admitted to the Queanbeyan Private Nursing Home, where he died on 25 August 1972; he was buried with full military honours in the Ex-Servicemen's section of Woden Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The EDC Mini-grant Project-The Office of Equity, Diversity, and Community Relations {{developed}} this project to improve East Carolina University's number of diversity studies, programs, and groups. This project intends to supply resources and funds towards diversity proposals offered by students, campus organizations, faculty, and staff. These programs include monitoring cultural awareness educational seminars, to improve <b>departmental</b> climate, to recruit diverse students, for research for curriculum improvement, among others.|$|E
5|$|The state seal is {{maintained}} by the Governor of Indiana. It is used to certify the authenticity of official state documents.

The seal is also used on all commissions granted by the state as proof of the commission's authority.|$|E
5|$|Until 1864, {{communications}} between Fort Greble {{and its neighbors}} had to be routed through <b>departmental</b> headquarters in Washington. After {{a test of the}} system completely failed, efforts were made to establish signaling points between the forts, and the forts themselves were connected to Washington via telegraph wire. Signal detachments were present at Fort Stanton, near Uniontown, and sometimes visited Fort Greble as part of training efforts.|$|E
5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying <b>departmental</b> orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful of public opinion, {{and the perception of}} lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure prisoner welfare. The department was at the same time renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Colleges {{arrange the}} {{tutorial}} teaching for their undergraduates, {{and the members}} of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual <b>departmental</b> libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).|$|E
5|$|<b>Departmental</b> {{locomotives}} on the London Underground {{consist of}} vehicles {{of a number}} of types which are used for engineering purposes. These include battery locomotives, diesel locomotives, electric locomotives, sleet locomotives, pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars. Details of the first four types are covered elsewhere. Pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service, but continue to be used by the engineering department. Pilot motor cars are used to move other vehicles around the system, while ballast motor cars are used to haul ballast trains and engineering trains.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{internal}} hearing, the City of Chicago was simultaneously paying lawyers to defend Burge during an appeal by Wilson and a new civil case by Banks, while employing lawyers to prosecute him on <b>departmental</b> charges. The City of Chicago hired outside counsel to prosecute the detectives at {{the internal}} hearing. After having spent $750,000 to defend Burge in the Wilson case, the City of Chicago questioned whether to follow normal practices and pay {{for the defense of}} its police officers.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 21st century, {{there was}} {{dramatic}} <b>departmental</b> restructuring at the college, {{and a significant}} redevelopment and modernisation of the Hereford campus. The campus, located on Venns Lane, Hereford, is home to RNC's teaching, residential and leisure facilities. Students live in halls of residence, which enable them to gain a level of independence within the college environment. RNC operates a leisure facility, thePoint4, which {{is open to the}} public, and conferencing and hotel accommodation under the name Gardner Hall. Principal Mark Fisher took over from his predecessor (Sheila Tallon) in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|London Underground {{has owned}} {{a small number}} of <b>departmental</b> {{vehicles}} which were not ballast motor or pilot motor cars. Between 1935 and 1950, the District line had a weed-killing train, initially consisting of a 1905-built B stock driving motor car and a control trailer. The two cars were kept at Ealing Common depot, but the control trailer was scrapped in 1937 and replaced by a second motor car, to provide more power. Weed-killing duties were not carried out during the Second World War, and the vehicles were not refurbished subsequently. They were scrapped in 1950.|$|E
5|$|The London Underground {{has also}} owned several <b>departmental</b> {{self-powered}} vehicles designed for other duties. These include a tunnel cleaning train, {{consisting of two}} 1938 stock motor cars and three purpose-built cars, which act like a giant vacuum cleaner, and can hold 6 tons of dust before the filter tanks need to be emptied. Three Plasser & Theurer track tamping machines were purchased in 1980, and two Unimog road-rail vehicles were obtained in 1983 and 1986, for use as depot shunters.|$|E
5|$|The council's {{budget for}} the {{financial}} year 2015/16 is £437.2m (down from £444.8m in 2014/15). The main source of non-school funding is the formula grant, which is paid by government to local authorities based on the services they provide. The remainder, to which the police and fire authorities (and parish council where this exists) set a precept, is raised from council tax and business rates. Following the 2010 Spending Review, the council announced that 11.1% could be cut from <b>departmental</b> budgets to save £65m {{over a five-year period}} and up to 181 posts could be lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of Rebecca {{seems to me}} to have taken us further into the danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend at a time when <b>departmental</b> costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by Rebecca on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of not knowing what it is doing.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the reign}} of King Fuad I, two laws were passed that reorganized the {{educational}} structure at al-Azhar. The first of these, in 1930, split the school into three departments: Arabic language, sharia, and theology, with each department located in buildings outside of the mosque throughout Cairo. Additionally, formal examinations were required to earn a degree {{in one of these}} three fields of study. Six years later, a second law was passed that moved the main office for the school to a newly constructed building {{across the street from the}} mosque. Additional structures were later added to supplement the three <b>departmental</b> buildings.|$|E
5|$|Four Hungarian-built gate stock {{motor cars}} {{were used as}} ballast motor cars, and were {{numbered}} L13 to L16. The final one was stored in 1955, {{in the hope that}} it would be restored and preserved, but by 1960, the project appeared to be too costly, and so the gate end of the car was cut off, {{and the rest of it}} was scrapped. After refurbishment, the gate was displayed at the London Transport Museum. A further four Hungarian motor cars from the Piccadilly line were used as pilot motor cars during the reconstruction of the Hampstead line in 1922, and were numbered L17 to L20. Once a spur between the Hampstead line and the Piccadilly line at Kings Cross station was opened on 27 March 1927, it became much easier to transfer ballast motor cars between lines. The 14 <b>departmental</b> vehicles which were operational in 1934 continued to be used until 1953, by which time their age made maintenance very difficult. They were replaced over the next two years and scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Franco, {{dissatisfied}} with his career's direction, reenrolled at UCLA in autumn 2006 as an English major with a creative writing concentration. He received permission {{to take as}} many as 62 course credits per quarter compared to the normal limit of 19, while still continuing to act; receiving many of his credits from independent study for his involvement {{on the set of}} Spider-Man 3. He received his undergraduate degree in June 2008 with a GPA of 3.5/4.0. For his degree, Franco prepared his <b>departmental</b> honors thesis as a novel under the supervision of Mona Simpson, the biological younger sister of Steve Jobs. While at the university the actor studied French, the Holocaust, philosophy of science and American literature among other things. To continue acting, he would study on film sets.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Gowing became Reader in Contemporary History {{at the new}} University of Kent, Canterbury, {{covering}} scientific, technical, {{economic and}} social history. The UKAEA retained her as a consultant, paying her £1,000 per annum for three years. Her main task was to write a two-volume sequel to Britain and Atomic Energy 1939–1945 covering the period from 1945 to 1952. To help out, the UKAEA brought in Lorna Arnold from its Health and Safety Division in 1967 to become the <b>Departmental</b> Records Officer (DRO) and Gowing's Assistant Historian. Despite their being accredited as official historians, the Atomic Weapons Establishment would not let them take their notes away, {{so they had to}} do their writing on site, {{under the watchful eye of}} Aldermaston's DRO. To get there Gowing had to catch the train each day from Canterbury to London Waterloo station, and then the Tube to Paddington and the railway to Reading, where Arnold picked Gowing up in her car and drove to Harwell.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, she {{graduated}} with a Bachelor of Arts, with <b>departmental</b> honors in political science. After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, {{she became the first}} student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of commencement speaker Senator Edward Brooke. After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes. She was featured in an article published in Life magazine, due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke. She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers. That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).|$|E
5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached <b>departmental</b> quotas for most of the province.|$|E
5|$|Institute Professor is {{the highest}} title that can be awarded to {{a faculty member at}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a {{research}} university located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. It is analogous to the titles of distinguished professor, university professor, or regents professor used at other universities in recognition of a professor's extraordinary research achievements and dedication to the school. At MIT, Institute Professors are granted a unique level of freedom and flexibility to pursue their research and teaching interests without regular <b>departmental</b> or school responsibilities; they report only to the provost. Usually no more than twelve professors hold this title at any one time. The position was created by President James R. Killian in 1951 and John C. Slater was the first to hold the position.|$|E
5|$|The first ballast {{motor cars}} were former trailer cars {{built for the}} Central London Railway in 1900, which were {{converted}} to motor cars for trials of the first multiple system {{to be used in}} Britain, and were retained for <b>departmental</b> use after 1903. These were followed by French and Hungarian Gate stock cars, built in 1906, which were converted in the 1920s and 1930s. The next batch consisted on 14 standard stock cars converted in 1953. Rolling stock reorganisation and replacement in the 1970s on the District and Metropolitan lines resulted in a number of surface stock cars being used for pilot motor duties. Subsequently motor cars of 1938 stock and 1960 stock were used for this purpose, and complete 4-car units of 1962 stock.|$|E
5|$|Most historians sharply criticize Davis for his flawed {{military}} strategy, {{his selection}} of friends for military commands, and his neglect of homefront crises. Until {{late in the}} war, he resisted efforts to appoint a general-in-chief, essentially handling those duties himself. On January 31, 1865, Lee assumed this role, but it was far too late. Davis insisted on a strategy of trying to defend all Southern territory with ostensibly equal effort. This diluted the limited resources of the South and made it vulnerable to coordinated strategic thrusts by the Union into the vital Western Theater (e.g., the capture of New Orleans in early 1862). He made other controversial strategic choices, such as allowing Lee to invade the North in 1862 and 1863 while the Western armies were under very heavy pressure. When Lee lost at Gettysburg, Vicksburg simultaneously fell, and the Union {{took control of the}} Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy. At Vicksburg, the failure to coordinate multiple forces {{on both sides of the}} Mississippi River rested primarily on Davis's inability to create a harmonious <b>departmental</b> arrangement or to force such generals as Edmund Kirby Smith, Earl Van Dorn, and Theophilus H. Holmes to work together.|$|E
25|$|Executive {{authority}} was vested in a governor (intendente), who administered the department, {{and in a}} thirty-one-member <b>departmental</b> board (junta <b>departmental),</b> which carried out legislative functions. These functions included approval of the <b>departmental</b> budget and judicial actions, such as impeachment proceedings against <b>departmental</b> officials, including the governor. At the municipal level, a mayor (intendente municipal) assumed executive and administrative duties, carrying out resolutions made by the local board (whose members were appointed {{on the basis of}} proportional representation of the political parties). The governor was required to comply with and enforce the constitution and the laws and to promulgate the decrees enacted by the <b>departmental</b> board. The governor was authorized to prepare the budget, submit it for approval to the <b>departmental</b> board, appoint the board's employees, and, if necessary, discipline or suspend them. The governor represented the department in its relations with the national government and other <b>departmental</b> governments and in the negotiation of contracts with public or private agencies.|$|E
25|$|The rocade {{is formed}} in its western {{part by the}} {{national}} road 137, that meets two key roads, the <b>departmental</b> road 728 (that links Saintes to the Island of Oleron by Marennes) and the <b>departmental</b> road 150 that intersects near the locality of Diconche. In its southern part, the rocade integrates the national road 141, that runs east towards Cognac, Angoulême and Limoges. The <b>departmental</b> road 150, {{at the end of}} the east part, runs towards Niort by Saint-Hilaire-de-Villefranche et Saint-Jean-d'Angély. The town center of Saintes is bypassed by the avenue de Saintonge or <b>departmental</b> road 24, that crosses the Charente with the bridge de Saintonge, opened in 1969.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Departmental</b> Gendarmerie, or Gendarmerie Départementale, {{also named}} «La Blanche» (The White), {{is the most}} {{numerous}} part of the Gendarmerie, in charge of police in small towns and rural areas. Its territorial divisions {{are based on the}} administrative divisions of France, particularly the departments from which the <b>Departmental</b> Gendarmerie derives its name. The <b>Departmental</b> Gendarmerie carries out the general public order duties in municipalities with a population of up to 20 000 citizens. When that limit is exceeded, the jurisdiction over the municipality is turned over to the National Police.|$|E
