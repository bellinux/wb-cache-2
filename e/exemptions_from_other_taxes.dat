5000|$|The {{origin of}} the Leibzoll may {{be traced to the}} {{political}} position of the Jews in Germany, where they were considered crown property and, therefore, under the king's protection. In his capacity as Holy Roman emperor the king claimed the exclusive rights of the jurisdiction and taxation of the Jews, and retained responsibility for the protection of their lives and their property. He granted them protection either by a guard or by safe-conduct; chiefly by the latter, for the Jews, being extensive travelers, when they went on long business trips could not always be accompanied by imperial guards. The first instance of the granting of one of these safe-conducts occurred under Louis le Débonnaire (814-840), and a specimen of it may be found among the documents preserved in the [...] "Liber Formularum" [...] of that period. According to this document the king grants freedom of travel and <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> all taxes to three Jews of Lyons [...] "neque teloneum, neque paravereda aut mansionaticum, aut pulveraticum, aut cespitaticum, aut ripaticum, aut rotaticum, aut portaticum, aut herbaticum prædictis Hebræis exigere præsumant" [...] (De Rozières, [...] "Recueil Général des Formules Usitées dans l'Empire des Francs," [...] i. 41-43, Paris, 1859-1871; Simson, [...] "Jahrbücher des Fränkischen Reiches Unter Ludwig, dem Frommen," [...] i. 393-396, Leipsic, 1874-76). For such a safe-conduct the Jews were required to pay a certain fee; but this, being understood, is not stated anywhere, as the payment constitutes the only reason for the <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>taxes.</b> The stipulations regulating the tolls of Raffelstetten, , issued between 904-906, are to be interpreted in the same manner—the Jews, as privileged merchants, shall not pay more than the regular toll ("justum theloneum"). The law expressly states this conforms with the ancient custom (Pertz, [...] "Mon. Germaniæ Leges," [...] iii. 480; Georg Waitz, [...] "Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte", iv. 1, 70, Kiel, 1884; Scherer, [...] "Rechtsverhältnisse der Juden," [...] p. 110, Leipsic, 1901); the same is stated in the charter granted to the Jews of Worms, 1090 ("Zeitschrift für die Gesch. der Juden in Deutschland," [...] i. 139). When the Jews passed {{under the jurisdiction of the}} territorial rulers, this principle was acknowledged. Frederick II of Austria, in his law on the Jews, issued 1244, decreed that within the limits of his state they should not pay more than the legal rate of toll—the same rate that all other citizens had to pay (Scherer, l.c. p. 181). As in the stipulations regulating the , and as in the law of Frederick II, only customs duties for goods or slaves were mentioned: therefore a personal tax was unknown.|$|R

Today, such a tax is prohibited by the First Amendment (specifically the Establishment Clause) to the US Constitution. The United States and its governmental subdivisions also exempt most churches from payment of income tax (under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state statutes, which also allows donors to claim the donations as an income tax itemized deduction). Also, churches may be permitted <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> state and local taxes such as sales and property taxes, either in whole or in part. Clergy, such as ministers and members of religious orders (who have taken a vow of poverty) are exempt from federal income tax on income from ministerial services. Income from non-ministerial services are taxable and churches are required to withhold Federal and state income tax from this non-exempt income. They are also required to withhold employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes under FICA, and pay the employer's share for the non-exempt income.|$|R

40|$|Property tax {{is a tax}} on {{estimated}} values {{rather than}} on transactions—an important distinction <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>taxes.</b> Another distinction is that each state develops its own system for administering the property tax, including how properties are assessed. The consensus among scholars is that current market value assessment is the standard for achieving the most fair and equitable property tax burden. This study compares two disparate assessment standards in one urban county, analyzing potential determinants of systematic bias. The findings indicate that less systematic bias exists under the market value standard, but that the overall equity is only marginally better horizontally and tended toward a more regressive tax structure. A market value assessment standard may mitigate the inherent inequity (i. e., systematic bias) in a nonmarket value system. However, the inequities in the market value system, which may be less predictable, still must be monitored and addressed...|$|R

40|$|States are {{increasingly}} turning to environmental taxes {{as a means}} of raising revenue. These taxes are often thought to generate a double dividend: an environmental dividend stemming from the environmental improvement, and an economic dividend resulting from use of the revenue from environmental <b>taxes</b> to reduce <b>other</b> distortionary <b>taxes</b> (e. g., income or sales taxes). We review the economic literature on the double-dividend hypothesis, and show explicitly that the conditions under which the second dividend exists are less likely to hold when the amount of revenue that would be raised by an optimal environmental tax is small relative to the <b>tax</b> revenue <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>taxes.</b> We then present estimates of the potential revenue that could be raised from two environmental taxes in Connecticut. The results suggest that, because of their small tax base, environmental taxes are likely to have limited potential to raise revenue to finance state government budget deficits and/or reduce <b>other</b> distortionary <b>taxes.</b> Overall, environmental taxes could still generate significant gains for society if they lead to significant improvements in environmental quality. However, without more evidence of the existence of a double dividend, states should not try to justify these taxes on the basis of raising revenue more efficiently...|$|R
