I am well aware of whatever is there in your hearts regarding this matter but still I have taken it from you {{on the basis of}} my sword… Now if you see that I am not fulfilling your rights, then you should be happy with me with whatever is there.|$|E

"Brokeback Mountain {{has never}} been shown in China, but when you won Best Director in 2005 for that film, the Chinese media said, and I quote: [...] "You are {{the pride of the}} Chinese people all over the world." [...] Do you find that a little hypocritical, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> feted by China, yet your film is not allowed to be shown there?"Lee responded, ...|$|E
2500|$|The flaw is in {{the last}} step. While those two cases were {{originally}} equally likely, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> certain to find a gold coin if you had chosen the GG box, but are only 50% sure of finding a gold coin if you had chosen the GS box, means {{they are no longer}} equally likely given that you have found a gold coin. Specifically: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Naturally," [...] {{the clerk}} admitted; [...] "yet these gentlemen from Scotland Yard have special privileges, of course, and there remains the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> engaged to lunch with Mr. Fynes here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, my friend, <b>you</b> have <b>been</b> taking {{advantage}} {{for a long}} time now of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> ill. I'm not going to be your nurse indefinitely." [...] She slammed her bedroom door.|$|R
2500|$|The anatta {{doctrine}} {{is not a}} kind of materialism. Buddhism does not deny the existence of [...] "immaterial" [...] entities, and it (at least traditionally) distinguishes bodily states from mental states. Thus, the conventional translation of anatta as [...] "no-soul" [...] can be confusing. If the word [...] "soul" [...] simply refers to an incorporeal component in living things that can continue after death, then Buddhism does not deny {{the existence of the}} soul. Instead, Buddhism denies the existence of a permanent entity that remains constant behind the changing corporeal and incorporeal components of a living being. Just as the body changes from moment to moment, so thoughts come and go, and there is no permanent state underlying the mind that experiences these thoughts, as in Cartesianism. Conscious mental states simply arise and perish with no [...] "thinker" [...] behind them. When the body dies, Buddhists believe the incorporeal mental processes continue and are reborn in a new body. Because the mental processes are constantly changing, the being that is reborn is neither entirely different from, nor exactly the same as, the being that died. However, the new being is continuous with the being that died – {{in the same way that}} the [...] "you" [...] of this moment is continuous with the [...] "you" [...] of a moment before, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> constantly changing.|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{makes you}} so careless, Bob? Even if they did hear you when you fell, {{there is no reason}} why you should {{advertise}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> making cartridges." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In Scotland, I believe, sir," [...] the man replied. [...] "I called round this afternoon, {{although}} I {{was careful}} not to mention the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in town. The house is practically in the hands of caretakers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I gathered;" [...] {{said his}} host, [...] "from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> nearly punctual. I {{ought to have}} told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I'm a Food Reformer. I've ordered two bowls of bread-and-milk and some health biscuits. I hope you don't mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|The man {{dropped his}} voice. [...] "Carrie," [...] he said, [...] "I couldn't if I wished to. Love {{of one kind}} is indestructible. Even the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> forced into marrying another man cannot destroy it. He is, after all, an accident." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you wear}} a look of idiotic {{complacency}} in a Turkish bath," [...] said the other, [...] "it is the more noticeable from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> wearing nothing else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{took it upon}} myself to-day {{to mention}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> alive and well to one who had a right, I thought, to know of it, and who is coming hither tomorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am open to correction, sir, but is {{not your}} dilemma due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{at a loss to}} explain to his grace why you are in New York instead of in Colorado?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I {{have given}} a very good account of you,’ said she, ‘which I hope you may justify. I told them there <b>was</b> nothing against <b>you</b> beyond the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> put to the haw (if that is the right word) for debt.’ ...|$|R
60|$|To {{prove to}} <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I had not {{forgotten}} you before your letter came, {{here is the}} fragment of an unfinished one which I send you, to begin with--an imperfect fossil letter, which no comparative anatomy will bring much sense out of--except the plain <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not forgotten....|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, sir, in {{the name}} of myself and all my fellow-passengers I offer you my sincerest thanks for the manner in which you saved our lives. How close a shave it was is shown by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{yourself}} unable to get off the ship in time and were carried down with her.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If you do escape," [...] Fenn said quietly, [...] "you will {{view the}} matter differently. You will find, {{as a matter}} of <b>fact,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{powerless}} to do anything. You will find a new law and a new order prevailing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Once throw {{conventions}} aside," [...] he began, [...] "once do {{the things}} that people don't do--" [...] and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to meet a young man is no longer proof of anything, except, indeed, that people will talk.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{else could}} it be, since I {{failed to deliver}} you up to the British?" [...] he asked {{with an air of}} innocence. [...] "Had I <b>been</b> so minded, <b>you</b> would have <b>been</b> made prisoners within an hour after coming into this house, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not taken into custody shows that I was playing {{honestly}} with you." ...|$|R
50|$|Herrera {{continued}} to face rejection {{from the art}} world during her time in New York, largely due to her gender. Herrera herself commented <b>that</b> “the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a woman was against you.” When attempting to enter her art for an exhibition at the Rose Fried gallery, the female curator, Rose Fried, told her she could not include the work because Herrera was a woman.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, never mind. Take {{it from me}} that I am Edith Butler. Now {{listen to}} me. That {{manuscript}} reached me when I was in the country. There was no name on it. That in itself points strongly to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> its author. It was precisely the chuckle-headed sort of thing you would have done, to put no name on the thing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, by your law," [...] the {{terrorist}} replied significantly. [...] "But by our law, believe me, {{it is quite}} lawful. You must accustom yourself to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in another world than the one of oppression and brutality in which you have lived." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is wonderful! I {{knew you}} must be a person of distinction, by your fine {{presence}} and courtly address, and by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not subjected to the indignity of hobbles, like myself and the rest. Would you tell me your name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have not his {{attempted}} {{crimes against}} {{you and your}} husband forfeited whatever rights the bonds of kinship might have accorded him?" [...] asked Tarzan. [...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> his sister has not deterred him from seeking to besmirch your honor. You owe him no loyalty, madame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As for my {{familiarity}} with your appearance, {{you know as}} well as I that I have never seen <b>you</b> before. But <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not necessary--you conform perfectly to the printed description of you with which the kingdom is flooded. Were that not enough, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> discovered with old Von der Tann's daughter is sufficient to remove the least doubt as to your identity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was nothing--really nothing," [...] said Corey. [...] "Beyond the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{not quite}} yourself, {{there was nothing}} whatever. My father DID speak of it to me," [...] he confessed, [...] "when we were alone. He {{said that he was}} afraid we had not <b>been</b> {{thoughtful}} of <b>you,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in the habit of taking only water; I told him I had not seen wine at your table. The others said nothing about you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Top {{executives}} from a Japanese property company and casualty insurer we've owned for years just {{in our office}} last month explaining {{the extent of the}} CDO exposure in their investment portfolio, which was upsetting to us. We said,"Didn't the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> buying a triple-A rated product with a yield much in excess of what you could get from Procter & Gamble sound too good to be true?". But that kind of thing happened around the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a man {{of modest}} tastes, Mr. Thain," [...] the Marquis observed. [...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> unmarried, however, of course renders an {{establishment}} an unnecessary burden. You will bear in mind, so far as regards the rent of Broomleys, Mr. Thain, that the house is furnished." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a prisoner, my poor Kitticut, is {{evidence}} that you are weaker than King Cos, and I prefer {{to deal with the}} strong. By the way," [...] he added, turning to the King of Regos, [...] "have these prisoners any connection with the Land of Oz?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As you {{stooped to}} sit down just now, I {{distinctly}} saw the shape of your revolver in your hip pocket. You {{know as well as}} I do that with your name and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> only a naturalised Englishman, it is inexcusably foolish to be carrying firearms about just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{father was}} denounced before the {{committee}} of public safety as one who was hostile to the Convention. He was accused of having sent {{large sums of money}} to England, and was believed to have sent his wife and daughter there also, with the intention, of course, of following them; and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> known to be fighting in the ranks of the brigands, as they call the Vendeans, was also mentioned as an additional crime on his part." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is not astonishing, Miss Beth," [...] he replied. [...] "The puzzling <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> here--and {{under such}} auspices," [...] he added, {{in a lower}} tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{that we need}} say nothing, Isabel. You {{have not}} injured him. But we may let all that pass away. The <b>fact</b> remains <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the heiress of Llanfeare." ...|$|R
