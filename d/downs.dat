5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory {{about the origin of}} cricket is that it first developed in early medieval times to the south and south-east of London in the geographical areas of the North <b>Downs,</b> the South <b>Downs</b> and the Weald. The counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey were therefore the earliest centres of excellence and it was from here that the game reached London, where its lasting popularity was ensured, and other southern counties like Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire and Middlesex. As early as c.1611, a cricket match was recorded at Chevening in Kent between teams representing the <b>Downs</b> and the Weald.|$|E
5|$|The {{offense is}} given a series of four plays, known as <b>downs.</b> If the offense {{advances}} ten or more yards in the four <b>downs,</b> they are awarded {{a new set of}} four <b>downs.</b> If they fail to advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in field goal range, they might also attempt to score a field goal. A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the <b>downs</b> and the distance measurements. On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the first down line to the viewing audience.|$|E

5|$|Tim <b>Downs</b> scouted {{possible}} {{areas for}} location filming.

When <b>Downs</b> returned with the photos, Shatner felt that the locations the scout found would be perfect for the film.|$|E
