500|$|Linkin Park {{was founded}} in 1996 as the rap rock band Xero: lead guitarist Brad Delson, vocalist and rhythm guitarist Mike Shinoda, drummer Rob Bourdon, turntablist Joe Hahn, lead vocalist Mark Wakefield and bassist Dave Farrell (who {{subsequently}} left to tour with Tasty Snax). In 1999, after Wakefield's departure, lead vocalist Chester Bennington joined the five members of Xero and the band was renamed Linkin Park. Bennington's previous band, Grey Daze, had recently disbanded, so his lawyer recommended him to Jeff Blue, vice president of A coordination for Zomba, {{who at the time}} was seeking a lead vocalist for Xero. Blue sent Bennington two tapes of Xero's unreleased recordings — one with vocals by former Xero member Mark Wakefield, and the other with only the instrumental tracks — asking for his [...] "interpretation of the songs". Bennington wrote and recorded new vocals over the instrumentals and sent the tapes back to Blue. As Delson recalls, [...] " [...] really was kind of the final piece of the puzzle [...] We didn't see anything close to his talent <b>in</b> <b>anybody</b> else." [...] After Bennington joined, the group first renamed itself to Hybrid Theory and released a self-titled EP. Legal complications with Welsh electronic music group Hybrid prompted a second name change, thus deciding on [...] "Linkin Park". Throughout 1999, Linkin Park was a regular act at the Los Angeles club, The Whisky.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{decided to}} try being a solo act with a change of scenery. In late 1967, funded by a small family inheritance, he moved to London, living in various areas: Notting Hill, Belgravia, and Chelsea. After {{recording}} some demos in Soho, his friend Kortchmar gave him his next big break. Kortchmar used his association with the King Bees (who once opened for Peter and Gordon), to connect Taylor to Peter Asher. Asher was A head for the Beatles' newly formed label Apple Records. Taylor gave a demo tape of songs, including [...] "Something In The Way She Moves," [...] to Asher, who then played the demo for Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison. McCartney remembers his first impression: [...] "I just heard his voice and his guitar and I thought he was great [...] and he came and played live, {{so it was just}} like, 'Wow, he's great.'" [...] Taylor became the first non-British act signed to Apple, and he credits Asher for [...] "opening the door" [...] to his singing career. Taylor said of Asher, who later became his manager, [...] "I knew from the first time that we met that he was the right person to steer my career. He had this determination in his eye that I had never seen <b>in</b> <b>anybody</b> before." ...|$|E

"I don't {{know how}} to say NO to you," [...] I cried, [...] "after you've been so wonderfully kind and nice; but reasons which I can't fully explain just now make me feel it would be wrong of me to think of {{stopping}} with you.

60|$|But Stephen did not speak, feeling, no doubt, that {{to pursue}} the subject would be either to court an ethical, even an abstract, disquisition, and this one did not do <b>in</b> <b>anybody's</b> presence, much less one's wife's or daughter's; or to touch on sordid facts of {{doubtful}} character, which was equally distasteful in the circumstances.

60|$|He waved {{me back to}} my chair, which I did not, however, {{immediately}} resume. I was not in {{the least}} offended.
