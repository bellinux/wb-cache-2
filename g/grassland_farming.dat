We estimate stochastic output distance functions to represent the production technology. TFP change is calculated and decomposed using a generalized Malmquist productivity index. Our results show that <b>grassland</b> <b>farms</b> can in general keep up with conventional farms.

40|$|French suckler farmers need {{advice on}} the impact of the {{conversion}} to OF. To help them with their decision-making process, we constructed an LP model that optimises the farming system, taking OF constraints and nitrogen balance into account. According to the model, the shift to OF had a greater impact on a mixed crop-livestock farm system than on that of a <b>grassland</b> <b>farm.</b> As a result of the very high cost of organic N fertiliser and the necessity of maintaining the N balance, the shift to OF {{in the case of the}} mixed farm resulted in less emphasis on cereal and more emphasis on livestock. For this type of farm, a significant drop in its proportional costs due to extensification was sufficient to maintain the overall gross margin of the holding. For the extensive <b>grassland</b> <b>farm,</b> the production system remained almost the same after the conversion. In this case, only a slight area extensification was needed. Costs increased due to the higher price of the concentrates purchased, and a 30 % increase of the selling price of the meat was therefore necessary to maintain the overall gross margin...|$|R

40|$|Grassland {{agriculture}} {{is an important}} industry for livestock production and land management throughout the world. We review the principles of nutrient cycling in grassland agriculture, discuss examples of <b>grassland</b> <b>farming</b> systems research, and demonstrate the usefulness of whole-farm simulation for integrating economic and environmental components. Comprehensive studies conducted at the Karkendamm experimental farm in northern Germany and the De Marke experimental farm in the Netherlands have quantified nutrient flows and developed innovative strategies to reduce nutrient losses in <b>grassland</b> <b>farming</b> systems. This {{research has focused on}} improving the utilization of manure nutrients on the farm by including grain crops in cropping systems with grassland and by incorporating manure handling techniques that reduce nitrogen losses. Although the information generated in experimental farms is not always directly applicable to other climates and soils, it is being transferred to other regions through computer simulation. A whole-farm model calibrated and verified with the experimental farm data is being used to evaluate and refine these strategies for commercial farms in other areas. Simulation of farms in northern Europe illustrate that on the sandy soils of this region, maize (Zea mays L.) silage can be used along with grasslands to increase farm profitability while maintaining or reducing nutrient loss to the environment. Use of cover crops, low emission barns, covered manure storages, and direct injection of manure into soil greatly reduces N losses from these farms, but their use creates a net cost to the producer. By integrating experimental farm data with whole-farm simulation, more sustainable grassland production systems can be cost-effectively evaluated, refined, and transferred to commercial production...|$|E
40|$|Researched {{topic is}} to asses the {{influence}} of different proces of farming on permanent grassland (livestock grazing vegetation, mowing, various agronomic measures). The goal is to realize and make a proposal that farming on permanent grassland is more profitable, {{what is the best}} quality forage biomass and what effect it may have on foragestand composition. The use of <b>grassland</b> <b>farming</b> activities is necessary because grasslands are one of the major components of feed base for livestocks as well as participate in some non-productive functions of agriculture. If there is no farming on grassland, there would be a succession and consequently climax forest condition.

The data-base consists of organic <b>grassland</b> and mixed <b>farms</b> in Germany from 1994 / 95 to 2005 / 06. In a first step five inputs and one output are analyzed {{by means of a}} stochastic frontier production function, allowing for heteroscedasticity and technical effects. The selection of determinants of technical efficiency is based on location theory. Since organic farming has regional centers, technical efficiency (TE) of organic farms is found to be affected by regional variables (such as agglomeration effects). In a second step we identified regional clusters of organic farms and analyzed the technical efficiency of the regional clusters. The results show that organic farms in distinct regions show different efficiency performance - suggesting that there are agglomeration and urbanization effects in the organic market.

40|$|Diffuse {{microbial}} {{pollution from}} agriculture {{is a key}} contributor to water quality impairment. Reducing the risk of microbial contamination of watercourses from agricultural sources requires both environmentally appropriate and socially acceptable mitigation and management approaches. A cross-disciplinary toolkit for on-farm microbial risk assessment is presented that can represent both social and environmental factors promoting or preventing the accumulation of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) within the farm environment, and also their subsequent transfer to watercourses. Four key risk criteria were identified as governing FIO loss from land to water. These were ‘accumulating E. coli burden to land’, ‘landscape transfer potential’, ‘infrastructure’ and ‘social and economical obstacles to taking action’. The toolkit {{can be used to}} determine (i) the relative risk of a farm enterprise contributing to microbial watercourse pollution and (ii) appropriate and targeted mitigation {{to reduce the risk of}} FIO loss from land to water. A comparison of the toolkit output with microbiological water quality draining from three contrasting <b>grassland</b> <b>farm</b> enterprises provided a preliminary evaluation of the prototype approach. When applied to 31 <b>grassland</b> <b>farm</b> enterprises the toolkit suggested that 0 % were categorised as negligible risk, 32 % low, 65 % medium, 3 % high and 0 % very high risk. Such qualitative risk-based tools can assist the policy community not only to target high risk areas, but also to develop mitigation strategies that are sensitive to the different ways in which risk is produced. Capacity for long-term cross-disciplinary research is argued to be the means by which these integrated and more sustainable solutions may emerge...|$|R
