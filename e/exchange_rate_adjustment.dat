The dynamics of the adjustment for both groupsof countries are also analyzed. The results show that while both groups tend to eliminate reserve disequilibria fast, those countries that have maintained a fixed rate tend to do it more slowly than countries that have occasionally devalued their currency. It Is also shown that the year prior to a devaluation, international reserves have been, on average, 30 % below their short-run desired level. These results are important since they indicate that not all LDC's should be aggregated for prediction purposes.

40|$|Abstract This study {{tries to}} show empirically the short-run {{monetary}} effects of commodity exports price {{changes on the}} nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>adjustment</b> in Indonesia via money supply and domestic inflation rate for the period 1999 to 2012. It is concentrated on commodity oil and an average of {{the rate of change}} in the world price of four main commodity exports (oil, rubber, palm oil, plywood). This study examines {{the extent to which the}} rate of depreciation or appreciation of the Indonesia???s currency, rupiah, has responded to the world price changes of these commodities. Based on the monetary approach to nominal exchange rate adjustments, this study used the analytical model of Edwards (1986) as well as Reviane (1992) which looks at interactions among commodity export prices, money creation, inflation, and the nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>adjustment.</b> In case for cil commodity, this study finds that the changes in the world price of oil has positive effect to the money growth only, but has not influenced the nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>adjustment</b> directly and indirectly through money creation and the domestic inflation. However, in case of three commodities (rubber, palm oil, plywood) has positive effect to the money growth, and has negative effect to the nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>adjustment</b> directly and indirectly through money creation and the domestic inflation. Finally, in case of four commodities (oil, rubber, palm oil, plywood) finds that changes in the average of the world price of rubber, palm oil and plywood together with oil price changes have negative effect only to the nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The implication of this study is that, for Indonesia, the world price of oil is no longer plays a dominant role on their nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>adjustment.</b> On the other hand, the policy-makers should fully sterilized the accumulation of international reserves when the world price of main commodity export increases...|$|E

In our model, a single currency area, as compared with a system of national currencies and floating exchange rates, brings both welfare costs associated with the absence of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>adjustment</b> and welfare benefits associated with risksharing. The model provides a utility-based comparison of costs versus benefits. While theoretically, either monetary regime may dominate, quantitatively, the net welfare benefits of a single currency area are likely to be negative. ...|$|E
