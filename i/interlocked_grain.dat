2500|$|The {{seat of a}} Windsor {{chair is}} an {{essential}} part since it provides the stability to both the upper and lower portions. The thickness of the seat allows the legs to be anchored securely into their respective tapered sockets, providing the undercarriage with strength and stability. A timber that will provide the strength and stability whilst also allowing it to be shaped, in order to achieve the desired look and feel, requires a strong durable timber, with <b>interlocking</b> <b>grain,</b> to provide the right characteristics. [...] English Windsors typically have elm seats because its <b>interlocking</b> <b>grain</b> gives good cross-grain strength that resists splitting where holes are placed close {{to the edge of a}} seat. There are no real satisfactory alternatives to elm although other woods have been tried, for example, oak and ash in Britain and various types of pine in the USA. [...] Because of elm's strength compared to pine, tulip poplar or bass, English Windsor chair seats are usually not as thick as American Windsors. [...] The English Windsor chair seats are not saddled (or dished) as deeply as their American counterparts- partly because of elm's relative strength, and partly because elm is comparatively more difficult to sculpt than the softer woods chosen by American chair makers. Woodwrights use tools such as the adze, scorp or inshave to form the hollowed out, form fitting, ergonomic top of the seat.|$|R

The elm's wood bends well and distorts easily making it quite pliant. [...] The often long, straight, trunks were favoured as a source of timber for keels in ship construction. Elm is also prized by bowyers; of the ancient bows found in Europe, a large portion of them are elm. During the Middle Ages elm was also used to make longbows if yew was unavailable.|$|R
50|$|The timber {{is not of}} much {{importance}} commercially, and is {{not found}} anywhere in great quantity. Macoun considered it more durable {{than that of the}} other elms, and better suited for railway ties, fence-posts, and rails, while Pinchot recommended planting it in the Mississippi valley, as it grows fast in youth, and could be utilized for fence-posts when quite young, since the sapwood, if thoroughly dried, is quite as durable as the heartwood. The wood is also used for the hubs of wagon wheels, as it is very shock resistant owing to the <b>interlocking</b> <b>grain.</b> The wood, as 'red elm', is sometimes used to make bows for archery.

5000|$|Hardwoods are {{employed}} in a large range of applications, including fuel, tools, construction, boat building, furniture making, musical instruments, flooring, cooking, barrels, and manufacture of charcoal. Solid hardwood joinery tends to be expensive compared to softwood. In the past, tropical hardwoods were easily available, but the supply of some species, such as Burma teak and mahogany, is now becoming scarce due to over-exploitation. Cheaper [...] "hardwood" [...] doors, for instance, now consist of a thin veneer bonded to a core of softwood, plywood or medium-density fibreboard (MDF). Hardwoods {{may be used in}} a variety of objects, but are most frequently seen in furniture or musical instruments because of their density which adds to durability, appearance, and performance. Different species of hardwood lend themselves to different end uses or construction processes. This is due to the variety of characteristics apparent in different timbers, including density, grain, pore size, growth and fibre pattern, flexibility and ability to be steam bent. For example, the <b>interlocked</b> <b>grain</b> of elm wood (Ulmus spp.) makes it suitable for the making of chair seats where the driving in of legs and other components can cause splitting in other woods.|$|E

40|$|The minimum {{expended}} {{energy for}} fracture is the free energy required to form two new surfaces. For intergranular fracture, the minimum surface formation energy {{is complicated by}} the rough fracture surface, with area greater than the specimen cross-section. We utilize network optimization algorithms (max-flow/min-cut) to determine the minimum surface formation energies and surfaces for intergranular fracture in 3 D polycrystals. For equiaxed grains and uniform boundary strength, the minimum energy fracture area is independent of grain size and is 45 % larger than the specimen cross-section, and intergranular fracture will occur when surface energy is less than 1. 6 times the grain boundary energy. The 3 D fracture area is larger than projected from 2 D systems. In systems with microcracked boundaries, the fracture surface deviates to preferentially include microcracked boundaries, creating <b>interlocking</b> <b>grain</b> configurations. Two-dimensional percolation of microcracks occurs at about 80 % microcracked boundaries...|$|R
40|$|There {{appear in}} the wood of Entandrophragma, beside the basic <b>interlocked</b> <b>grain,</b> local minute {{undulations}} of grain the manifestation of which are checkered figures, either slanting or horizontal, on the radial face of boards. In reference to the model the slanting checkered figure is interpreted {{as the result of}} sudden appearance in the cambium of a wave of orientational tendency (morphogenetic wave) of relatively short wavelengths and stabilized amplitude from the moment of its appearance, moving vertically. This wave induces undulations in the arrangement of cambial initials. The undulation pattern also moves, however, its rate is half that of the morphogenic wave rate. The amplitude of the undulations oscillates between a maximal value and null which means that in successive wood layers there is wavy grain alternating with straight grain. The horizontal checkered figure may be explained by a local shift of the prase by one half of the period of the morphogenic wave of relatively long wavelengths underlying the <b>interlocked</b> <b>grain</b> formation...|$|E
40|$|Grain {{deviations}} {{and high}} extractives content are common features of many tropical woods. This study aimed at clarifying their respective impact on vibrational properties, referring to African Padauk (Pterocarpus soyauxii Taub.), a species selected for its <b>interlocked</b> <b>grain,</b> high extractives content and uses in xylophones. Specimens were cut {{parallel to the}} trunk axis (L), and local variations in grain angle (GA), microfibril angle (MFA), specific Young's modulus (E 0 L/q, where q stands for the density) and damping coefficient (tandL) were measured. GA dependence was analysed by a mechanical model which allowed to identify the specific Young's modulus (E 03 /q) and shear modulus (G 0 /q) along the grain (3) {{as well as their}} corresponding damping coefficients (tand 3, tandG). This analysis was done for native and then for extracted wood. <b>Interlocked</b> <b>grain</b> resulted in 0 - 25 _ GA and in variations of a factor 2 in E 0 L/q and tandL. Along the grain, Padauk wood was characterized, when compared to typical hardwoods, by a somewhat lower E 03 /q and elastic anisotropy (E 0 /G 0), due to a wide microfibril angle plus a small weight effect.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the usability of different dynamic moduli of elasticity and wood density for {{the prediction of}} mechanical properties - static modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture - in samples with grain deflection from the longitudinal direction. Five tropical hardwoods (Afzelia bipindensis, Intsia bijuga, Millettia laurentii, Astronium graveolens and Microberlinia brazzavillensis) with different grain characteristics were used for this purpose. The fiber deflection {{was caused by the}} presence of <b>interlocked</b> <b>grain</b> or the working process. The three nondestructive techniques used in this study - longitudinal and flexural resonance method and ultrasound method - provided higher values of modulus of elasticity than the static bending test, but close correlation was observed between these variables. The weakest correlation was found for the ultrasound method which is probably caused by its measuring mechanism. The prediction of the modulus of rupture is less accurate when the dynamic modulus of elasticity is compared with the static modulus of elasticity; on the other hand, it was still good in comparison with the density model, which is inapplicable when grain deflection occurs in wood. In the wood of Zebrano where the <b>interlocked</b> <b>grain</b> was strongly developed, almost all of the correlation coefficients showed the lowest values and the prediction of modulus of rupture by nondestructive techniques was unsatisfactory...|$|E
