40|$|The {{coliform}} {{group has}} been used extensively {{as an indicator of}} water quality and has historically led to the public health protection concept. The aim of this review is to examine methods currently in use or which can be proposed for the monitoring of coliforms in drinking water. Actually, the need for more rapid, sensitive and specific tests is essential in the water industry. Routine and widely accepted techniques are discussed, as are methods which have emerged from recent research developments. Approved traditional methods for coliform detection include the multiple-tube fermentation (MTF) technique and the membrane filter (MF) technique using different specific media and incubation conditions. These methods have limitations, however, such as duration of incubation, antagonistic organism interference, lack of specificity and poor detection of slow-growing or viable but non-culturable (VBNC) microorganisms. Nowadays, the simple and inexpensive membrane filter technique is the most widely used method for routine enumeration of coliforms in drinking water. The <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>coliforms</b> based on specific enzymatic activity has improved the sensitivity of these methods. The enzymes β-Image galactosidase and β-Image glucuronidase are widely used for the detection and enumeration of total coliforms and Escherichia coli, respectively. Many chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates exist for the specific detection of these enzymatic activities, and various commercial tests based on these substrates are available. Numerous comparisons have shown these tests may be a suitable alternative to the classical techniques. They are, however, more expensive, and the incubation time, even though reduced, remains too long for same-day results. More sophisticated analytical tools such as solid phase cytometry can be employed to decrease the time needed for the detection of bacterial enzymatic activities, with a low detection threshold. <b>Detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>coliforms</b> by molecular methods is also proposed, as these methods allow for very specific and rapid detection without the need for a cultivation step. Three molecular-based methods are evaluated here: the immunological, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in-situ hybridization (ISH) techniques. In the immunological approach, various antibodies against coliform bacteria have been produced, but the application of this technique often showed low antibody specificity. PCR can be used to detect coliform bacteria by means of signal amplification: DNA sequence coding for the lacZ gene (β-galactosidase gene) and the uidA gene (β-Image glucuronidase gene) has been used to detect total coliforms and E. coli, respectively. However, quantification with PCR is still lacking in precision and necessitates extensive laboratory work. The FISH technique involves the use of oligonucleotide probes to detect complementary sequences inside specific cells. Oligonucleotide probes designed specifically for regions of the 16 S RNA molecules of Enterobacteriaceae can be used for microbiological quality control of drinking water samples. FISH should be an interesting viable alternative to the conventional culture methods for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>coliforms</b> in drinking water, as it provides quantitative data in a fairly short period of time (6 to 8 h), but still requires research effort. This review shows that even though many innovative bacterial detection methods have been developed, few have the potential for becoming a standardized method for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>coliforms</b> in drinking water samples. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

30|$|The <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>coliforms</b> and E. coli in milk {{indicates}} a possible contamination from milk-handling containers (Bonfoh et al. 2003). Coliforms are indicator micro-organisms, {{and the presence}} of E. coli implies a risk of presence of enteric pathogens in milk (Chye et al. 2004). Therefore, the coliforms in bulked milk could be originating from other sources of contamination, such as milk handlers, besides the milk-handling containers. Studies have shown that handling small quantities of milk is subject to a high rate of contamination due to the small ratio of milk volume to container volume (Bonfoh et al. 2003).

Earlier studies have shown that milk from the camel udder have low microbial load compared to pooled/bulked milk in plastic containers (Matofari et al. 2007; Kaindi et al. 2011).

Except for the coliforms and the fluoride levels exceeding a little over 1. 5 mg/L in 8 % of the samples, drinking water in the distribution system {{in the study area}} can generally be said to have met the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines during the study period. However, with the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>coliforms</b> and E. Coli at the household standpipes, the possibility of the distribution system in Skudai having pathogen contamination from time to time cannot be dismissed...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} {{chromogenic}} {{media for}} <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>coliforms</b> and E. coli increases as they allow fast identification of colonies directly on the plate without further confirmation steps. We obtained an atypical strain from a raw milk sample forming bright red colonies on RAPID'E. coli 2 agar, {{as opposed to the}} violet coloration characteristic for E. coli, or blue/green coloration characteristic for coliforms. API 32 E and MALDI-TOF analysis were used to identify isolate 2099 as E. coli. While API ID 32 E analysis resulted in a biochemical profile characteristic for E. coli, isolate 2099 was found to be phenotypically β-glucuronidase positive but β-galactosidase negative, which resulted in atypical red coloration of its colonies on RAPID'E. coli 2 agar. In order to elucidate possible causes of the β-galactosidase negative phenotype, we sequenced the lacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase. A mutation leading to a premature stop codon at amino acid position 774 was identified, rendering the polypeptide abnormally short and most likely not functional. Considering our findings, not only β-glucuronidase, but also β-galactosidase negative E. coli represent a challenge to routine diagnostic procedures screening for E. coli with chromogenic media that rely on detection of β-glucuronidase and β-galactosidase activity...|$|E
40|$|Waterborne {{outbreaks}} {{associated with}} contamination {{of drinking water}} by Campylobacter jejuni are rather common in the Nordic countries Sweden, Norway, and Finland, where in sparsely populated districts groundwater is commonly used without disinfection. Campylobacters, Escherichia coli, or other coliforms have rarely been detected in potential sources. We studied three waterborne outbreaks in Finland caused by C. jejuni and used sample volumes of 4, 000 to 20, 000 ml for analysis of campylobacters and sample volumes of 1 to 5, 000 ml for analysis of coliforms and E. coli, depending on the sampling site. Multiple samples obtained from possible sources (water distribution systems and environmental water sources) {{and the use of}} large sample volumes (several liters) increased the chance of detecting the pathogen C. jejuni in water. Filtration of a large volume (1, 000 to 2, 000 ml) also increased the rate of <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>coliforms</b> and E. coli. To confirm the association between drinking water contamination and illness, a combination of Penner serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (digestion with SmaI and KpnI) was found to be useful. This combination reliably verified similarity or dissimilarity of C. jejuni isolates from patient samples, from drinking water, and from other environmental sources, thus confirming the likely reservoir of an outbreak...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrochemical}} method for detecting bacteria, {{based on a}} linear relationship between inoculum size {{and the time of}} hydrogen evolution, was tested for the early <b>detection</b> and monitoring <b>of</b> <b>coliforms</b> in naturally contaminated estuarine and fresh water samples. Standard methods for coliform analysis were performed on each sample, and membrane filtration counts were used to construct dose-response curves; relationships and results are discussed herein...|$|R
40|$|Coliform {{group has}} been {{extensively}} used {{as an indicator of}} drinking water quality and historically led to the public health protection concept. Multiple tube fermentation technique has been currently used for assessment of the microbial quality of drinking water. This method, however, has limitations. Enzymatic assay constitute an alternative approach for detecting indicator bacteria, namely total coliforms and E. coli in various aquatic environments. This study compared the performance of LMX® broth as an enzymatic assay with the standard methods multiple tube fermentation technique and presence–absence test, for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> indicator <b>coliforms</b> in drinking water samples. In addition, the potential effect of water quality on the microbial detection method was assayed through measurement of some physicochemical parameters. From the 50 drinking water samples tested, 8 (16 %) and 7 (14 %) contained total coliforms and E. coli as indicated by all three techniques. Although on average the LMX recovered more total coliforms and E. Coli numbers comparing to multiple tube fermentation, but there was no significant difference. A significant difference existed between the level of residual chlorine for positive and negative samples. In conclusion, enzymatic assay showed a rapid and less labor method, allowing the simultaneous <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> total <b>coliforms</b> and E. coli. The method is particularly useful in the early warning of fecal pollution of drinking water...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria {{which were}} β-d-galactosidase and β-d-glucuronidase {{positive}} or expressed {{only one of}} these enzymes were isolated from environmental water samples. The enzymatic activity of these bacteria was measured in 25 -min assays by using the fluorogenic substrates 4 -methylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactoside and 4 -methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucuronide. The enzyme activity, enzyme induction, and enzyme temperature characteristics of target and nontarget bacteria in assays aimed at detecting coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli were investigated. The potential interference of false-positive bacteria was evaluated. Several of the β-d-galactosidase-positive nontarget bacteria but none of the β-d-glucuronidase-positive nontarget bacteria contained unstable enzyme at 44. 5 °C. The activity of target bacteria was highly inducible. Nontarget bacteria were induced much less or were not induced by the inducers used. The results revealed large variations in the enzyme levels of different β-d-galactosidase- and β-d-glucuronidase-positive bacteria. The induced and noninduced β-d-glucuronidase activities of Bacillus spp. and Aerococcus viridans were approximately the same as the activities of induced E. coli. Except for some isolates identified as Aeromonas spp., all of the induced and noninduced β-d-galactosidase-positive, noncoliform isolates exhibited at least 2 log units less mean β-d-galactosidase activity than induced E. coli. The noncoliform bacteria must be present in correspondingly higher concentrations than those of target bacteria to interfere in the rapid assay for <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>coliform</b> bacteria...|$|R
