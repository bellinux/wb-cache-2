Pectic oligosaccharides also enhanced lactobacilli growth during mixed batch faecal fermentation. We demonstrated that all pectic substrates were anti-adhesive for E. coli O 157 :H 7 binding to human HT 29 cells. Lower molecular weight and deesterification enhanced the anti-adhesive activity. We showed that all pectic samples reduced Stx 2 cytotoxicity in HT 29 cells, as measured by the reduction of human rRNA depurination detected by our novel TaqMan-based RT-qPCR assay, with POS 1 performing the best.

Polysaccharides were extracted using {{the hot water}} method. The mushrooms had lower polysaccharide yields (8 to 10 %) than the herb (31 %). Fermentation kinetics were determined using the in vitro cumulative gas production technique. End-products, such as gas, volatile fatty acids (VFA), and ammonia, were also determined. The gas profiles of intact materials were similar for AstS and LenS. The TreS had a diphasic digestion pattern. The extracts had similar profiles to the intact materials though gas production rates were faster. Intact materials tended to produce less VFA than the extracts though LenS and AstE had the highest total VFA production overall. Intact materials contained more protein than the extracts, and therefore resulted in more branched-chain fatty acids and ammonia. Fermentation kinetics and end-point products demonstrated differences in availability of substrates between the mushrooms and herb. These medicinal mush-room and herb materials, particularly their polysaccharide extracts, show promise in altering microbial activities and composition in chicken ceca.

First experiment examined three carbohydrate sources (cassava meal, pollard and coarse grinding corn) for their capacities to improve physical (color, odor, texture and spoilage), fermentative (pH, protein degradation, organic acid profiles), and utilities characteristics of the silages for ruminants (rumen <b>fermentabilities</b> and digestibilities) in vitro. The silages had bright greenish brown of color, lactic acid odor, and firm textures, categorized as highly fermentable and digestible feeds (dry matter digestibility > 72 %). Compare to other additives, cassava meal produced better silage. However, high butyric acid and protein degradation proportions in the silage were not seem in line to these data. Coarse grinding corn failed to do its function therefore produced poor silage quality. Second experiment was designed to confirm the previous results. Five carbohydrate sources (cassava meal, pollard, fine grinding corn, rice bran, and cassava extract meal) of the same functions were examined. The results confirmed that cassava meal produced very good ramie leave silages (Fleigh number > 80) while the others produced quite good ramie leaves silage qualities (Fleigh number 40 – 60).

Reduced ruminal efficiency, liver and lung abscesses, and laminitis are all thought to be re-lated to SARA. Both the nutritionist and dairy manag-ers {{are responsible for the}} delivery and consumption of a ration that is likely to produce a ruminally healthy pH. Nutritionists should consider the expected amount of physically effective neutral detergent fiber provided by ration ingredients, along with their expected rumi-nal <b>fermentabilities</b> and resultant microbial acid pro-duction. Environmental conditions, such as heat stress, overcrowding, and uncomfortable stalls, which may al-ter feed intake patterns and animal behavior, should also be considered in ration formulation. Additional amounts of physically effective neutral detergent fiber, and/or a reduction in ruminal nonstructural carbohy-drate availability, may be warranted during times of increased animal stress. Higher levels of intake may also predispose the rumen to SARA, since salivary buffer secretion may not adequately compensate for additional acid production. Forage drymatter should be determined twice weekly, or more frequently if results vary by more than 5 percent of the dry matter value. Ration variability can be further reduced by premixing individual forages, or at least attempting to make each loader bucket of feed a uniform mix obtained from the entire height or face of the bunker silo.

So far is seems like the pretreatment is the part of the entire process that is most difficult to run satisfactorily in a large-scale process. In this study a set of simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) experiments were conducted in order to compare two materials pretreated in the pilot plant in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden with an optimally preatreated material produced in a process development unit (PDU) in Lund. The materials were also examined in a Scannning Electron Microscopy study. In addition, it was investigated which of two enzyme preparations (Celluclast 1. 5 L and Saf-ISIS) was most efficient in SSF. The need for addition of extra β-glucosidase was also investigated. The study proved that the pretreatment in the pilot plant was not optimal. The highest ethanol yield achieved in the SSF was 69 % of the theoretical, which should be compared to the PDU material where over 90 % of the theoretical yield was achieved. The most evident reason was the low degree of hydrolysis of the pilot materials. Lower <b>fermentabilities</b> of these materials also seemed to contribute to the lower yields. Several possible explanations of the results are proposed; the residence times and scaling up-effects probably being the most reasonable ones. The SEM study also generated a possible explanation why the PDU material was more easily hydrolysed. The cellulose seemed to be more exposed and to contain larger pores. The enzyme comparisons indicated that Celluclast was a more efficient enzyme preparation initially. It was also proved that β-glucosidase addition do not affect the performance when using cellulases from Saf-ISIS, if high SSF yields are desired. 1...|$|R

40|$|Lignocellulosic ethanol {{production}} {{is considered to}} be a significant source of liquid fuels and is being developed as a renewable energy source for blending with gasoline, thereby reducing petroleum consumption and decreasing CO 2 emissions. Since plant dry matter (i. e. corn stover, sugar cane bagasse and hardwood) consists of recalcitrant structural polymers including hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin, pretreatment of biomass is an essential process to disrupt the cell wall structure and expose cellulose for subsequent hydrolysis. Pretreatment exposes or removes the closely associated components, hemicellulose and lignin, expose cellulose to enzyme digestion. The formed sugars are then fermented to ethanol. However, a diverse mixture of compounds are released during the pretreatment, and depending on substrate property and conditions of pretreatment, small molecules that cause severe enzyme inhibition or deactivation and/or decrease ethanol fermentations, may be released. Phenols and furan derivatives are well known inhibitors for enzyme hydrolysis and/or fermentation performance. Research has been performed to minimize these compounds, deveop strategies for minimizing enzyme inhibition, and develop microorganisms tolerance to soluble lignocellulose-derived inhibitors. This dissertation examines the mitigation of inhibition using three different approaches with corn stover, hardwood and corn pericarp, respectively. ^ (1) For corn stover, the removal of inhibitors through a biological detoxification was carried out before the fermentation using fungus Coniochaeta ligniaria NRRL 30616 which can metabolize and eliminate inhibitory compounds in the liquid hot water pretreated corn stover liquors. Alleviating toxic compounds (mainly phenols) followed with either enzyme or acid treatment for removing oligosaccharides (mainly xylo-oligomers) improved enzyme hydrolysis of the cellulose and fermentation performance. ^ (2) For corn pericarp, fractionation and separation of the corn kernels in the enzyme-based concept were pursued to obtain the corn pericarp. The corn pericarp was utilized as a substrate to hydrolyze in the enzyme preparations to produce fermentable sugars and determine its <b>fermentabilities.</b> The formation of the inhibitory compounds from the fractionated corn pericarp was found to be closely related to its particle size, and the accumulation of total phenols resulted in the significant decrease in enzymatic hydrolysis. Moreover, potential inhibitory effects of hydrolysate solids found to be relieved by photochemical oxidation of the solids in the air. Successful {{ethanol production}} from the pericarp showed the design of process for substitutive glucose source that can convert to add-value molecules. ^ (3) Adaptation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae NRRL-Y 1546 strain to inhibitory compounds medium (MS 929, steam-pretreated hydrolysate solution, obtained from Mascoma Corporation) was used to determine whether adapted yeast had a tolerance to fermentation inhibitors, was able to ferment glucose to ethanol. The fermentations using the adapted yeast showed a greater resistance and a decreased fermentation lag phase compared to the results with non-adapted strain. ...|$|R

The thermostability of β-amylase {{is known to be}} an important factor in determining <b>fermentability,</b> thus the thermostability of the other relatively thermolabile enzyme, limit dextrinase, was investigated to determine if it was also useful in predicting <b>fermentability.</b> To facilitate this aim, methods were developed for a rapid and cost efficient assay of both β-amylase and limit dextrinase thermostability. Internationally important Australian and international malting varieties were compared for their total limit dextrinase and β-amylase activity and thermostability. Interestingly, the level of limit dextrinase thermostability was observed to be inversely correlated with total limit dextrinase activity. The prediction of malt <b>fermentability</b> was achieved by both forward step-wise multi-linear regression (MLR) and the partial least squares (PLS) multivariate model development methods. Both methods produced similar identifications of the parameters predicting wort <b>fermentability</b> at similar levels of predictive power. Both models were substantially better at predicting <b>fermentability</b> than the traditional use of DP on its own. The emphasis of this study was on the identification of predictive factors that can be consistently used in models to predict <b>fermentability,</b> because the model parameter estimates will subtly vary depending on mashing conditions, yeast strain/fermentation conditions and malt source. The application of these multivariate model development methods (PLS and MLR) enabled the identification of further potential <b>fermentability</b> predicting factors. The analyses divided the predictive parameters into those defined by DP enzymes and those associated with modification (KI, FAN, fine/coarse difference, wort β-glucan and friability). Surprisingly, limit dextrinase thermostability was not a substantial predictor of <b>fermentability,</b> presumably due to its negative correlation with total limit dextrinase activity.

RS 3 il led to the lowest <b>fermentability.</b> Furthermore, increased butyrate ratios were observed for all preparations. The varying RS preparations behaved similarly in the dynamic fermentation but showed high SDs. Moreover, the <b>fermentability</b> was slow during the first 24 h, indicating that the microbiota needed an adaptation period to ferment RS. Propionate ratios increased at the expense of butyrate with exception for RS 2 dy showing an increase in acetate only. Differences in <b>fermentability</b> observed between the dynamic model, allowing a closer simulation of the in vivo behavior, and the batch model, recommended for screening purposes, could be due to the varying microbiota used. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

30|$|We {{obtained}} 72 yeast strains able to ferment xylose {{from the}} approximate 100 natural samples collected. The ethanol production ability of each isolated strain was determined using a rich medium with YPX medium containing 4 % xylose. Among the isolated strains, 16 strains produced {{a significant amount}} of ethanol from xylose. To examine the <b>fermentability</b> of xylose, the time courses of ethanol concentration and xylose consumption from YPX medium at different temperatures were monitored by HPLC. We observed that one yeast strain, strain ATY 839 (which was isolated from soil in Kyoto University) exhibited high xylose <b>fermentability</b> (data not shown).|$|E

It also has deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) compound, that is potential to increase <b>fermentability</b> of fibrous feed in ruminal system. An in vitro experiment was conducted to investigate the capability of mulberry leaves to substitute concentrate as feed for ruminant in increasing <b>fermentability</b> of fibrous feed in ruminal system. This experiment was carried out using randomized block design with five treatments and four replications. The treatments were: P 0 (50 % rice straw + 50 % concentrate) as a control, P 1 (50 % rice straw + 37. 5 % concentrate + 12. 5 % mulberry leave), P 2 (50 % rice straw + 25 % concentrate + 25 % mulberry leave), P 3 (50 % rice straw + 12. 5 % concentrate + 37. 5 % mulberry leave), P 4 (50 % rice straw + 50 % mulberry leave). Variables measured were <b>fermentability</b> (NH 3 and VFA concentrations), pH, gas production, dry matter and organic matter digestibility. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and duncan multiple range test was further {{used to test the}} significant differences. VFA concentration, dry matter digestibility and organic matter digestibility were significantly difference (P< 0. 05) among treatments. However, there was no significant effect on the other variables. It is concluded that mulberry leave are able to substitute the concentrate and increased <b>fermentability</b> of fibrous feed in ruminal system...|$|E
40|$|Diastatic power (DP), {{a measure}} of the level of {{activity}} of starch-hydrolyzing enzymes, is a term that refers to the combined activity levels of beta-amylase, alpha-amylase, limit dextrinase, and alpha-glucosidase. The result of the action of these enzymes during brewing is to break down starch into component sugars that are readily fermented into alcohol by yeast. Although DP is a reasonable predictor of <b>fermentability,</b> it does not always accurately estimate the level of fermentable sugars generated during mashing or the subsequent <b>fermentability</b> of the resultant wort. Previously, {{it has been shown that}} allelic variation in beta-amylase thermostability has a significant impact on wort <b>fermentability.</b> The thermostability of the DP enzymes is critical in determining fermentable sugar yield during mashing, where the mash temperature profile is a balance between the temperature required for starch gelatinization to enable efficient hydrolysis and the rate of thermal inactivation of the DP enzymes. This study demonstrates that there is significant variation in the thermostability of alpha-amylase and limit dextrinase in malts made from a wide range of Australian and international malting barley varieties. This variation in alpha-amylase and limit dextrinase thermostability combined with that of beta-amylase provides an opportunity for barley breeders to produce divergent malting varieties that better fulfill brewers’ <b>fermentability</b> requirements. The implications of the varying DP enzyme thermostability on the selection of malt by brewers to optimally suit different brewing styles and regimens are outlined...|$|E
40|$|The sugar level, <b>fermentability,</b> and {{acceptability}} by voles of ryegrass straw {{treated with}} different acids were compared. Sugar release was highest with HCl, but acceptability was best with H 3 PO 4 treatment. Candida utilis grew about equally well {{on all of}} the treated samples, except the one treated with 0. 5 N HCl. That sample supported no growth, possibly because the level of chloride or degradation products of monomeric sugars was too high. <b>Fermentability</b> and palatability of straw were highest when treated with a combination of 0. 23 N HCl and 0. 15 N H 3 PO 4. Fermentation with Aureobasidium pullulans further increased the palatability of the acid-treated straw...|$|E

Concentration and ruminal digestibility of starch in rations of lactating cows has important effects on productivity. Starch is more digestible and less filling than forage fiber and provides more glucose precursors than fiber from any source. Ruminal <b>fermentability</b> of starch is affected by grain and endosperm type, processing and conservation method, and diet and animal factors, and affects production of fermentation acids and microbial protein in the rumen. Excessive ruminal <b>fermentability</b> can decrease fiber digestibility, efficiency of microbial protein production, and alter ruminal biohydrogenation, decreasing synthesis of milk fat and increasing energy partitioned to body condition {{at the expense of}} milk. The concentration and ruminal <b>fermentability</b> of starch affects feed intake, and energy partitioning of cows differently as they progress through lactation. High-producing cows in early to mid-lactation thrive on high-starch rations with highly fermentable starch sources while starch concentration and <b>fermentability</b> should decrease as lactation progresses to maintain yield of milk fat and prevent excessive body condition. Highly fermentable starch sources should be limited in rations for the first two weeks following parturition to avoid further depression in feed intake, and decrease risk of ruminal acidosis and displaced abomasum. Grouping cows by physiological state (fresh, early to mid, maintenance) is required to formulate diets for starch to optimize health and production...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} evaluate the silage quality of sorghum forage varieties of Citayam and BMR 3. 6 strain at different harvesting times {{and the effectiveness of}} a legumes addition as a concentrate substitute in sorghum forage silage-based diets on in vitro <b>fermentability</b> using rumen fluid of beef cattle. Experimental design for silage quality was completely randomized design with 2 x 3 factorial, i. e., forage sorghum types (Citayam and BMR 3. 6) and time of harvesting the forage sorghum (85, 95, and 105 d). Experimental design for in vitro <b>fermentability</b> and digestibility was randomized block design with 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, i. e. types of ration (with 2 levels i. e., a mixture of legumes and concentrate) and types of sorghum forage silages (with 2 levels i. e., Citayam and BMR 3. 6). All silages had a good odor, color, and texture. Silage of sorghum harvested at 105 d had better grades and was selected for in vitro studies. The treatment had no effect on pH and organic matter digestibility. BMR 3. 6 based silage had greater values of NH 3, total VFA, rumen microbial population, methane, and dry matter digestibility. Substitution of concentrate with a mixture of legumes did not affect <b>fermentability,</b> microbe population and digestibility in the rumen. Silage of sorghum strain BMR 3. 6 harvested at 105 d had a very good quality and mixing with legumes could replace concentrate in forage sorghum silage based diet on in vitro <b>fermentability</b> and digestibility using beef cattle rumen fluid...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to evaluate the effect of inoculants consortium consisted of Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) and combined with rice bran addition on microbiological characteristic and <b>fermentability</b> of king grass (Pennisetum hybrid) silage. Effectivity of treatments was assessed by addition of inoculants (control, Lp, Lp+Sc) and level of rice bran (0, 5 and 10 %) which were arranged on Completely Randomized Design with Teatments Factors (3 x 3). The variables measured were total colonies of microbes (lactic acid bacteria, yeast and clostridia), total gas production, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and ammonia (NH 3). Results showed that clostridial colonies counted on silage treated by Lp and Lp+Sc around 37. 5 % and 68. 7 % in which lower than control. Addition of inoculants and rice bran increased <b>fermentability</b> of silage significantly (P 0. 05) on production of VFA and NH 3. Gas production from silage fermentable fraction with inoculation of Lp (49. 5 ml) and Lp+Sc (47. 9 ml) higher than untreated silage (46. 6 ml). It was concluded {{that the use of}} inoculants consortium consisted of L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae with rice bran addition improved <b>fermentability</b> and reduced clostridial colony in king grass silage...|$|E
40|$|Unprocessed and acid-extruded {{rapeseed}} meal (RSM) was fed to broiler chickens, {{with and}} without addition of commercial pectolytic enzymes. Nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP) <b>fermentability</b> and unfermented NSP structures from RSM were studied in the excreta in detail. From unprocessed RSM, 24 % of the nonglucose polysaccharides could be fermented. Acid treatment {{did not have a}} significant effect, but enzyme addition did improve <b>fermentability</b> to 38 %. Most likely, the significant increase in NSP <b>fermentability</b> can be ascribed to the addition of pectolytic enzymes, which decreased branchiness of the water-soluble arabinan. Mainly xyloglucan, (glucurono-) xylan, (branched) arabinan, and cellulose remained in the excreta. The proportion of unextractable carbohydrates increased in excreta from broilers fed acid-extruded RSM. Probably, acid extrusion resulted in a less accessible NSP matrix, also decreasing the accessibility for pectolytic enzymes added in the diet. During alkaline extraction of the excreta, 39 to 52 % (wt/wt) of the insoluble carbohydrates was released as glucosyl- and uronyl-rich carbohydrates, probably originally present via ester linkages or hydrogen bonding within the cellulose-lignin network. These linkages are expected to hinder complete NSP fermentation and indicate that digestibility of RSM may benefit substantially from an alkaline treatment or addition of esterases...|$|E
