40|$|The Gaia {{satellite}} is a high-precision astrometry, photometry and spectroscopic ESA cornerstone mission, currently {{scheduled for}} launch in late 2011. Its primary science drivers are the composition, formation {{and evolution of}} the Galaxy. Gaia will achieve its scientific requirements with detailed calibration and correction for radiation damage. Microscopic models of Gaia's CCDs are being developed to simulate the charge trapping effect of radiation damage, which causes charge transfer inefficiency. The key to calculating {{the probability of a}} photoelectron being captured by a trap is the 3 D electron density within each CCD pixel. However, this has not been physically modelled for Gaia CCD pixels.

40|$|The Gaia {{satellite}} is a high-precision astrometry, photometry and spectroscopic ESA cornerstone mission, currently {{scheduled for}} launch in 2012. Its primary science drivers are the composition, formation {{and evolution of}} the Galaxy. Gaia will achieve its unprecedented positional accuracy requirements with detailed calibration and correction for radiation damage. At L 2, protons cause displacement damage in the silicon of CCDs. The resulting traps capture and emit electrons from passing charge packets in the CCD pixel, distorting the image PSF and biasing its centroid. Microscopic models of Gaia’s CCDs are being developed to simulate this effect. The key to calculating the probability of an electron being captured by a trap is the 3 D electron density within each CCD pixel. However, {{this has not been}} physically modelled for the Gaia CCD pixels. In Seabroke, Holland & Cropper (2008), the first paper of this series, we motivated the need for such specialised 3 D device modelling and outlined <b>how</b> <b>its</b> <b>future</b> results <b>will</b> fit into Gaia’s overall radiation calibration strategy. In this paper, the second of the series, we present our first results using Silvaco’s physics-based, engineering software: the ATLAS device simulation framework. Inputting a doping profile, pixel geometry and materials into ATLAS and comparing the results to other simulations reveals that ATLAS has a free parameter, fixed oxide charge, that needs to be calibrated. ATLAS is successfully benchmarked against other simulations and measurements of a test device, identifying how to use it to model Gaia pixels and highlighting the effect of different doping approximations...|$|R
40|$|We use the Gaia {{data release}} 1 (DR 1) {{to study the}} proper motion (PM) fields of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC). This uses the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) PMs for 29 Hipparcos stars in the LMC and 8 in the SMC. The LMC PM in the West and North {{directions}} is inferred to be (μ_W,μ_N) = (- 1. 872 ± 0. 045, 0. 224 ± 0. 054) mas/yr, and the SMC PM (μ_W,μ_N) = (- 0. 874 ± 0. 066, - 1. 229 ± 0. 047) mas/yr. These results have similar accuracy and agree to within the uncertainties with existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) PM measurements. Since TGAS uses different methods with different systematics, this provides an external validation of both data sets and their underlying approaches. Residual DR 1 systematics may affect the TGAS results, but the HST agreement implies this must be below the random errors. Also in agreement with prior HST studies, the TGAS LMC PM field clearly shows the clockwise rotation of the disk, even though it takes the LMC disk in excess of 10 ^ 8 years to complete one revolution. The implied rotation curve amplitude for young LMC stars is consistent with that inferred from line-of-sight (LOS) velocity measurements. Comparison of the PM and LOS rotation curves implies a kinematic LMC distance modulus m-M = 18. 54 ± 0. 39, consistent but not yet competitive with photometric methods. These first results from Gaia {{on the topic of}} Local Group dynamics provide an indication of <b>how</b> <b>its</b> <b>future</b> data releases <b>will</b> revolutionize this field.

40|$|This essay {{considers}} the future prospects for Critical Management Studies {{and by extension}} management studies more generally. To explore these, two frameworks from the wider social sciences are deployed. The anchorpoint for the discussion is Michael Burawoy's work distinguishing types of scholarship on the bases of a) conceptions of knowledge produced by social scientists, and b) different audiences for that knowledge. Critical Management Studies is founded on critique but <b>its</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> be determined by <b>how</b> it makes <b>its</b> way across Burawoy's other domains of professional, policy and public scholarship. To examine this, I draw on John Brewer's recent articulation of the ‘new public social science’. Brewer's problem-driven, post-disciplinary approach conceives the public value of social science as its conservation of moral sentiments and sympathetic imagination towards each other as social beings, and its ethical concern about the humanitarian future of humankind. The new public social science is normative and partisan, transgressive, scientific and impactful. I argue that this provides a potentially fruitful template to guide future management studies. This is {{a future in which}} Critical Management Studies – as management studies’ critical and emancipatory conscience – has a central role to play...|$|R
40|$|Japan is {{the first}} country that {{achieved}} the economic miracle of rapid growth. From stellar performance in the 1960 s, it shifted to slow-growth (1975 - 90) but it still maintained the highest growth, and lowest inflation, among G 7 economies. However, in the 1990 s it had the lowest growth rate among the G 7. This stagnation is due to three major factors. The first factor is the short-term reaction to the over-expansion {{of the economy in}} the late 1980 s. The financial sector still is struggling with the aftermath of the bubble. The second factor is the on-going contraction of manufacturing. Manufacturing drove Japan's growth, especially productivity growth, but now employment is falling in that sector. The third factor is long-term changes in the population structure, specifically, the rapid aging of the population and the low level of the birth rate. All these changes have serious macroeconomic effects on the economy. If the Japanese economy is to be revitalized, an intensive and extensive overhaul is required, urgently. If Japan does not succeed at this task, <b>its</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> be dismal...|$|R

This collection offers a vital intervention {{in the context of this}} anxiety, disenchantment and openness to other ways of living.

Its 'alternative hedonist' perspective informs an analysis that covers representations in film, TV and writing; new initiatives in the production and marketing of food; the ethics and politics of consumer choice; and philosophical and cultural inquiry into the nature of happiness and desire.

40|$|Coaching is at a {{crossroads}} as it moves into its second decade as an emergent profession. In some ways, <b>its</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> depend in part on its search for a past. As such, this paper offers an historical framework based on Peterson’s (1991, 2004) work on the evolving relationship between science and practice in psychology across three eras the preprofessional, the scientist-practitioner, and the professional and a fourth era, the postprofessional (Drake, 2005), which began in 1990 with the identification of systemic evidence as an explicit basis for practice. Lessons {{to be learned from}} these eras by coaches are identified while recognizing that coaching is, in many ways, an unprecedented phenomenon that requires new levels of thinking.
