25|$|Like many CPUs of its era {{the cycle}} timing of some {{instructions}} varied {{depending on the}} source operand(s). For example, the unsigned multiply instruction takes (38+2n) clock cycles to complete where 'n' {{is equal to the}} number of bits set in the operand. To create a function that took a <b>fixed</b> <b>cycle</b> count required the addition of extra code after the multiply instruction. This would typically consume extra cycles for each bit that wasn't set in the original multiplication operand.|$|E
25|$|During the 9th-century {{reforms of}} the Stoudios Monastery, the reformers favoured Palestinian composers in their new notated chant books heirmologion and sticherarion. Festal stichera, {{accompanying}} both the fixed psalms {{at the beginning and}} end of Hesperinos and the psalmody of the Orthros (the Ainoi) in the Morning Office, exist for all special days of the year, the Sundays and weekdays of Lent, and for the recurrent cycle of eight weeks in the order of the modes beginning with Easter. Their melodies were originally preserved in the tropologion. During the 10th century two new notated chant book were created at the Stoudios Monastery, which were supposed to replace the tropologion: the sticherarion, consisting of the idiomela in the menaion (the <b>fixed</b> <b>cycle</b> between September and August), the triodion and the pentekostarion (mobile cycle around the holy week), and the octoechos (hymns of the weekly cycle), a bulky volume which first appeared in the middle of the tenth century and contains over a thousand model troparia (prosomoia), and the heirmologion, which was either composed according to the eight echoi or according to the nine odes of the canon. These books were not only provided with musical notation, with respect to the former tropologia they were also considerably more elaborated and varied as a collection of various local traditions. In practice it meant that only a small part of the repertory was really chosen to be sung during the divine services.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{compared}} the health-related quality-of-life {{of patients with}} newly diagnosed multiple myeloma aged over 65 years or transplant-ineligible in the pivotal, phase III FIRST trial. Patients received: i) continuous lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone until disease progression; ii) <b>fixed</b> <b>cycles</b> of lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone for 18 months; or iii) <b>fixed</b> <b>cycles</b> of melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide for 18 months. Data were collected using the validated questionnaires (QLQ-MY 20, QLQ-C 30, and EQ- 5 D). The analysis focused on the EQ- 5 D utility value and six domains pre-selected for their perceived clinical relevance. Lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone, and melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide improved patients' health-related quality-of-life from baseline over {{the duration of the}} study across all pre-selected domains of the QLQ-C 30 and EQ- 5 D. In the QLQ-MY 20, lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in the Disease Symptoms domain compared with melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide at Month 3, and significantly lower scores for QLQ-MY 20 Side Effects of Treatment at all post-baseline assessments except Month 18. Linear mixed-model repeated-measures analyses confirmed the results observed in the cross-sectional analysis. Continuous lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone delays disease progression versus melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide and has been associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in health-related quality-of-life. These results further establish continuous lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone as a new standard of care for initial therapy of myeloma by demonstrating superior health-related quality-of-life during treatment, compared with melphalan, prednisone, thalidomid...|$|R

30|$|Liu (2011) {{illustrates}} the successful integration of Melbourne-Wübbena Wide Lane linear combination (Melbourne 1985; Wübbena 1985) and the TECR information to uniquely detect and <b>fix</b> <b>cycle</b> slips epoch by epoch in real-time. In that work, the SIPE problem however was not addressed.

This paper aims to develop an innovative approach to completely eliminating the impact of SIPE on cycle slip detection and fix. The reliability of cycle slip detection and fix can be enhanced particularly under degraded GNSS observation conditions such as large multipath errors or unexpected pseudorange anomalies.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Most of sensor MAC {{protocols}} have a <b>fixed</b> duty <b>cycle,</b> which performs poorly {{under the}} dynamic traffic condition observed in eventdriven sensor {{applications such as}} surveillance, fire detection, and objecttracking system. This paper proposes a traffic-aware MAC protocol which dynamically adjusts the duty cycle adapting to the traffic load. Our adaptive scheme operates on a tree topology, and nodes wake up only for the time measured for successful transmissions. By adjusting the duty cycle, it can prevent packet drops and save energy. The simulation results show that our scheme outperforms a <b>fixed</b> duty <b>cycle</b> scheme [5] and B-MAC [9], hence, it can achieve high packet fidelity and save energy.

30|$|This method detects and <b>fixes</b> <b>cycle</b> slip on a satellite-wise, {{real-time}} basis. The cycle slip {{detection and}} fix for each satellite is completely independent {{and does not}} rely on the information of any other satellites. The success of this method heavily relies {{on the use of}} the ionospheric physical property: TECR not exceeding the specified TECR threshold. Taking advantage of this property, cycle slip detection and fix is still successful even if all the GNSS satellites of a given epoch simultaneously experience arbitrarily large SIPE and any kind of cycle slips in the carrier phase data. The only disadvantage of the current method is that the parameter SIPEmax needs to be specified in advance before actual cycle slip detection and fix. Thus a sufficiently large value has to be defined to prepare for the worst situation. This might unnecessarily increase computational burden.|$|R

40|$|Aggressive voltage and {{frequency}} scaling are widely utilized to exploit the design margin introduced by the process, voltage and environment variations. However, scaling beyond the critical voltage or frequency results to numerous timing errors, and hence unacceptable output quality. In this paper, a computation-skip (CS) scheme is proposed for recursive digital signal processors with a <b>fixed</b> <b>cycles</b> per instruction (CPI) to correct timing errors. A CORDIC processor with the proposed CS scheme still functions when scaling beyond the sub-critical voltage or frequency. It improves EVM by 47. 9 dB at its most critical frequency or supply voltage, and extends the voltage scaling limit by 90 mV w. r. t the conventional CORDIC.
