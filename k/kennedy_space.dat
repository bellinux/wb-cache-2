5|$|Flight day 9 {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} preparations for landing, and the landing itself. Atlantiss deorbit burn {{was performed on}} orbit 128 at around 11:00amEST (16:00UTC), leading to a landing at <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center (KSC), Florida, on Runway 33 of the Shuttle Landing Facility.|$|E
5|$|NASA's {{facilities}} are research, construction and communication centers to help its missions. Some facilities serve {{more than one}} application for historic or administrative reasons. NASA also operates a short-line railroad at the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center and own special aircraft, for instance two Boeing 747 that transport Space Shuttle orbiter.|$|E
5|$|After {{display at}} the U.S. Space & Rocket Center and Johnson Space Center, the capsule {{was moved to the}} United States Astronaut Hall of Fame near Titusville, Florida. Since the recent {{relocation}} of the Astronaut Hall of Fame to the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center Visitor Complex, Sigma 7 has most recently been placed on {{display at the}} complex's new Heroes and Legends Hall.|$|E
5|$|John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center (KSC), {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} NASA facilities. It has been the launch site for every United States human space flight since 1968. Although such flights are {{currently}} on pause, KSC continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for America's civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.|$|E
5|$|On October 3, 2001, NASA chose Lockheed Martin as {{the primary}} {{contractor}} for the spacecraft's fabrication. By the end of 2001 all of the mission's instruments were selected. There were no major setbacks during MRO's construction, and the spacecraft was moved to John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center on May 1, 2005 to prepare it for launch.|$|E
5|$|STS-74 was {{the fourth}} mission of the US/Russian Shuttle-Mir Program, and the second docking of the Space Shuttle with Mir. Space Shuttle Atlantis lifted off from <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center launch pad 39A on 12 November 1995. The mission ended 8 days later with the landing of Atlantis back at Kennedy. It was the second {{in a series of}} seven {{straight}} missions to the station flown by Atlantis.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo 1 Command Module {{has never}} been on public display. After the accident, the {{spacecraft}} was removed and taken to <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center to facilitate the review board's disassembly in order to investigate {{the cause of the}} fire. When the investigation was complete, it was moved to the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and placed in a secured storage warehouse.|$|E
5|$|Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee {{were buried}} at Arlington National Cemetery. Ed White was buried at West Point Cemetery {{on the grounds}} of the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. Their names are among those of several astronauts and cosmonauts who have died in the line of duty, listed on the Space Mirror Memorial at the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center Visitor Complex in Merritt Island, Florida. President Jimmy Carter awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor posthumously to Grissom on October 1, 1978. President Bill Clinton awarded it to White and Chaffee on December 17, 1997.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, Shea and his ASPO colleagues at Houston boarded a NASA plane to the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center. They landed at about 1:00a.m., only five {{hours after the}} fire had broken out. At a meeting that morning with Robert Gilruth, George Mueller and George Low, Shea helped to {{determine}} the individuals who {{would be on the}} NASA review board looking into the causes of the fire. Additionally, he persuaded George Mueller, head of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, to allow him to act as Mueller's deputy in Florida, supervising the progress of the investigation.|$|E
5|$|North American shipped {{spacecraft}} CM-012 to <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center on August 26, 1966 under a conditional Certificate of Flight Worthiness: 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to {{be completed}} at KSC. But that was not all; an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery. Grissom became so frustrated with {{the inability of the}} training simulator engineers {{to keep up with the}} spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house and hung it on the simulator.|$|E
5|$|STS-125 {{was first}} {{assigned}} to Discovery with a launch date no earlier than May 2008. This originally moved the mission ahead of STS-119, ISS Assembly flight 15. Delays to several shuttle missions {{resulted in a}} change in mission ordering, and the orbiter was changed to Atlantis on 8 January 2007. The crew of Atlantis went to the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center for the Crew Equipment Interface Test in early July 2008. This allowed the STS-125 crew to get familiar with the orbiter and the hardware they would be using during the flight.|$|E
5|$|The Shuttle fleet {{lost two}} orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in 1986, and Columbia in 2003. While the 1986 loss was mitigated by {{building}} the Space Shuttle Endeavour from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter {{to replace the}} second loss. NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center on July 21, 2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.|$|E
5|$|The University of Central Florida fosters {{research}} amongst its thirteen academic {{colleges and}} schools, partnerships with corporations such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Siemens, and through partnerships with local community colleges. UCF also houses a satellite campus at the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. UCF {{is also a}} member of the Florida High Tech Corridor Council. The university has made noted research contributions to optics, modeling and simulation, digital media, engineering and computer science, business administration, education, and hospitality management.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} for the AS-202 and AS-204 missions {{were delivered}} by North American Aviation to the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center with long lists of equipment problems {{which had to}} be corrected before flight; these delays caused the launch of AS-202 to slip behind AS-203, and eliminated hopes the first manned mission might be ready to launch as soon as November 1966, concurrently with the last Gemini mission. Eventually the planned AS-204 flight date was pushed to February 21, 1967.|$|E
5|$|Van den Berg was {{assigned}} as Payload Specialist on STS-51B Challenger (April 29â€“May 6, 1985). STS-51B, the Spacelab-3 mission, was launched from the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center, Florida, {{and returned to}} land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was the first operational Spacelab mission. The seven-man crew aboard Challenger conducted investigations into crystal growth, drop dynamics leading to containerless material processing, atmospheric trace gas spectroscopy, solar and planetary atmospheric simulation, cosmic rays, and laboratory-animal and human medical monitoring.|$|E
5|$|About {{the time}} of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an {{existing}} Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C. Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama, Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Shepard {{was ranked}} as the ninth most popular space hero (tied with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Gus Grissom). In 2011, NASA honored Shepard with an Ambassador of Exploration Award, {{consisting}} of a Moon rock encased in Lucite, for his contributions to the U.S. space program. His family members accepted the award on his behalf during a ceremony on April 28 at the U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland, where it is on permanent display. On May 4, 2011, the U.S. Postal Service issued a first-class stamp in Shepard's honor, the first U.S. stamp to depict a specific astronaut. The first day of issue ceremony was held at NASA's <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center Visitor Complex.|$|E
5|$|The crew of Atlantis had six {{possible}} landing opportunities on Saturday. Managers {{evaluated the}} best three opportunities {{of the day}} to try bring the orbiter home. Saturday's first landing opportunity at <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center was waived due to poor weather forecasts, and observed weather violations for the landing criteria. After further evaluating weather patterns around Florida, managers on the ground chose to waive the second opportunity as well, and wait one more day to attempt to get the orbiter into Florida on Sunday. Weather in California had excellent forecasts, so if the attempts on Sunday to land in Florida were not successful, the shuttle would be able to land at Edwards Air Force Base without weather being an issue.|$|E
5|$|The launch had {{originally}} been scheduled for August 4, 1983, and was later rescheduled for August 20. The requirement to conduct testing with the TDRS system required a delay of ten days for the system to be ready, during which the stack remained on the launch pad. During the on-pad delay, Hurricane Barry (1983) hit the Florida coastline, making landfall {{just south of the}} <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center on the morning of August 25. The storm had only been identified two days earlier, and {{there was no time to}} roll Challenger back from the pad; the decision was made to secure the launch stack and ride out the storm.|$|E
5|$|Early {{conceptual}} {{designs of}} the Pod itself were based, as it {{existed in the}} novel, {{on one of the}} primary shapes in geometry, a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided figure. Eventually the Pod was modified to a spherical capsule that encases the traveler. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials allowed them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the space shuttle. There, they concentrated on the mechanics of the elevator and the gantry area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod itself, the interior of the elevator, and the gantry, which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.|$|E
5|$|For {{missions}} beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO), NASA {{has been}} directed to develop the Space Launch System (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and the two to six person, beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft, Orion. In February 2010, President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies. During {{a speech at the}} <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V. In his speech, Obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a manned mission to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010. The act officially canceled the Constellation program.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, many colleges and school districts across Florida remained closed. President George W. Bush declared all of Florida a federal disaster area. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center did not restore its complete work force until September 13 due to relief operations, as well as a lack of gasoline, ice, and water in the area. A total of 8000 members of the National Guard helped out with recovery efforts soon after the storm left the Florida peninsula. Residents in the areas of impact after the storm were under a boil water order, {{because of the lack of}} electricity to area water systems. Churches prepared meals for those without power and food themselves. Federal employees were granted excused absences if they helped with law enforcement and the cleanup. Thousands of portable generators were sent to the state by Home Depot and Lowe's home improvement stores. The United States Army Corps of Engineers installed blue tarpaulins on 41,556 damaged roofs statewide. Damage to the Florida citrus crop caused orange futures to rise four cents a pound due to Frances.|$|E
5|$|Preparation for {{the mission}} began on June 3, with the {{assembly}} of the shuttle's solid rocket boosters (SRB) on the Mobile Launcher Platform. The boosters were stacked on June 20, 1983, and the external tank mated to the assembly on June 23. Challenger arrived at <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center on June 29, and {{was transferred to the}} Orbiter Processing Facility on June 30. After post-flight maintenance and preparation for the new mission, including the installation of most flight payloads, the shuttle was transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building on July 27, and mated to the booster/tank stack. The stack was checked out on July 29 and 30, and moved to Launch Complex 39A on August 2, 1983. INSAT-1B was loaded into the orbiter when on the pad; the overall processing time from Challenger arriving at KSC to being ready for launch was only sixty-two days, a record for the program at the time.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} system was {{declared}} a tropical storm, gale warnings were issued for the central Bahamas starting on October8. Slightly more than 24hours later, a hurricane watch was issued on Eleuthera and the Abaco Islands. By early on October11, both of the alerts were discontinued. Later that day, gale warnings were issued from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Virginia Beach, Virginia. The warning area was extended to {{as far north as}} Nantucket, Massachusetts on October13. The warning for the area from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Virginia Beach, Virginia was discontinued late on October14. Simultaneously, gale warnings were issued from Nantucket to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. In addition, another gale warning was also issued from Cape Cod to Boston, Massachusetts. By October15, all gale warnings were discontinued. Early in the hurricane's duration, NASA developed a contingency plan for delaying a landing of the space shuttle Challenger by a day in the event Josephine passed near <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center. The shuttle crew filmed the hurricane from orbit using an IMAX camera. This footage of the storm was featured in the 1985 IMAX documentary The Dream is Alive.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{action was}} taken along the Gulf Coast as the threat the storm posed, {{predicted}} to come ashore at Category Four strength, became more urgent. Over a half million people evacuated their homes in Texas and Louisiana, including everyone in Iberia Parish. A total of 200,000people evacuated in Louisiana. At least 2,000 volunteers staffed 115 Red Cross shelters in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. More than 20,000people stayed in those shelters. The Red Cross also sent over 160,000 meals to the area. A total of 3,000 prison inmates in Texas were evacuated to safer inland locations. The launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis was delayed for five days when the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center was threatened by the storm, {{the first time a}} launch in Florida had been delayed because of weather in Houston. Stores across the warning area were very busy in advance of the storm. In New Iberia, Louisiana, hardware stores ran out of stock, and businesses in Lafayette, Louisiana reported similar shortages.|$|E
5|$|The University of Central Florida (UCF) is a {{metropolitan}} public research and space-grant university {{located on a}} 1,415-acre (5.73km2) main campus in Orlando, Florida, United States. UCF is a member institution of the State University System of Florida and is the largest university in the United States in terms of undergraduate enrollment. It was founded in 1963 as Florida Technological University {{with the goal of}} providing highly trained personnel to support the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Florida's Space Coast. After the university's academic scope expanded in the mid and late 1970s to encompass a wider variety of disciplines, the school was renamed The University of Central Florida in 1978. Initial enrollment in 1968 was 1,948 students; as of 2014, the university has 59,770 students from more than 140 countries, all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Since the university's first graduating class in 1970, UCF has awarded more than 250,000 degrees, including 45,000 graduate and professional degrees, to over 200,000 alumni.|$|E
5|$|When {{tropical}} cyclones {{move over}} land, they often produce the wind shear and atmospheric instability {{required for the}} development of weak, embedded supercell thunderstorms, which can produce tornadoes. These tornadoes are usually weak and short-lived, but still capable of producing significant damage. While centered over the Gulf of Mexico, the eastern side of Hurricane Elena's circulation spawned several such tornadoes over central Florida. A tornado struck just east of Leesburg on September 1, destroying 64 single-family houses and mobile homes, and damaging another 118; seven people were treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Later that same day, another tornado touched down over downtown Leesburg, with much less damage. In nearby Marion County, tornadic activity destroyed six mobile homes, compromised another 50 residences, and inflicted as much as $500,000 in total losses, though only minor injuries were reported. At <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center Launch Complex 39 in Cape Canaveral, a weak tornado struck two vehicles near the location where Space Shuttle Atlantis was being prepared for its first flight. A tornado in New Port Richey tore parts of the roof off at least one building and brought down trees, and tornadic activity was also identified in Sumter County.|$|E
5|$|After Gordon {{emerged into}} the Atlantic north of Cuba, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{tropical}} storm warning for southern Florida from Jupiter to the Dry Tortugas, and later extended it to Boca Grande up along the west coast; this was extended to Bayport {{on the west coast}} and to Titusville on the east coast while the storm was approaching the Florida Keys. When Gordon attained hurricane status and turned suddenly to the northwest, a hurricane warning was issued from Bogue Banks to the North Carolina/Virginia border. Florida governor Lawton Chiles activated the state's Emergency Operations Center. In the Florida Keys, state parks were closed, which forced some campers to leave, and all schools were closed. On the mainland, University of Miami and Miami Dade College were also closed. Space Shuttle Atlantis was forced to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California instead of <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center. The storm caused flights to be canceled or delayed at Miami International Airport, and nearly all flights were canceled to and from the Florida Keys. Hundreds of people evacuated to shelters in five counties in east-central Florida. In North Carolina, officials suggested people in low-lying areas to go to higher ground, but they did not issue evacuation orders.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{awarding}} of the contract, a preliminary design review {{was carried out in}} September 1972, followed by a critical design review in September 1976 after which the engine's design was set and construction of the first set of flight-capable engines began. Final review of all the Space Shuttle's components, including the engines, was conducted in 1979. The design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones, initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of the design, including the HPFTP, HPOTP, valves, nozzle and fuel preburners. The individual engine component tests were followed by the first test of a complete engine (0002) on March 16, 1977. NASA specified that, prior to the Shuttle's first flight, the engines must have undergone at least 65,000 seconds of testing, a milestone that was reached on March 23, 1980, with the engine having undergone 110,253 seconds of testing by the time of STS-1 both on test stands at Stennis Space Center and installed on the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA). The first set of engines (2005, 2006 and 2007) were delivered to <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center in 1979 and installed on , before being removed in 1980 for further testing and reinstalled on the orbiter. The engines, which were of the first manned orbital flight (FMOF) configuration and certified for operation at 100% rated power level (RPL), were operated in a twenty-second flight readiness firing on February 20, 1981, and, after inspection, declared ready for flight.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 1, {{hurricane}} warnings were issued for the northwest Bahamas while hurricane watches were issued for the lower east coast of Florida and tropical storm watches were issued for the Florida Keys. There was the potential for catastrophic damage along Florida's heavily populated east coast, with warnings that damages from Frances could exceed the insured losses of Hurricane Andrew. These damage estimates were in anticipation that Frances would strike Florida as a strong Category Four hurricane. Preparations for the storm were stepped up in Florida on September 1. Governor Jeb Bush {{declared a state of}} emergency, <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center closed down, and evacuations of 500,000people were initially ordered. Eventually 41 counties received evacuation orders, covering 2.8million residents, the largest evacuation in Florida's history. The state education system also responded to the pending crisis. Many universities across Florida canceled classes. Both the University of Central Florida and the University of North Florida told all students to leave their dorms. Evacuation at the University of South Florida was performed on a dorm-by-dorm basis. Florida Atlantic University was closed for a week and a half. Most schools were shut down from southern Miami-Dade County to just south of Melbourne two days before the hurricane. The annual Florida State University-University of Miami college football game was rescheduled for the following week.|$|E
25|$|Space Shuttle Atlantis (November 15â€“20, 1990) was {{launched}} at night from <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center. During the five-day mission the crew conducted Department of Defense operations. After 80 orbits of the earth, Atlantis and her crew landed {{back at the}} <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Space</b> Center, in the first Shuttle recovery in Florida since 1985.|$|E
