50|$|Tip {{lines are}} an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of fills, {{but they can}} apply to many other types of context such as dumps. Tip lines are the angles which the {{contexts}} form {{as an indicator of}} action in the past. As fills of a feature form stratigraphically, the direction off the horizontal by which they form may give us information. For example, a ditch that has fills all angled, so one side of each fill is higher on a specific side of the ditch, would suggest that the ditch was backfilled from the side where the fills were highest. (See archaeological section in fig 2). This can be circumstantial evidence for features or detail not preserved in the archaeological record. This reading of a fills deposition morphology is an example of why deposits and contexts are important discoveries in themselves independent of whether they represent structures or contain artifacts.|$|E

5000|$|Danto {{laid the}} groundwork for an {{institutional}} definition of art that sought to answer the questions raised by the emerging phenomenon of twentieth-century art. The definition of the term “art” is a subject of constant contention and many books and journal articles have been published arguing over {{the answer to the question}} [...] "What is Art?" [...] Definitions can be categorized into conventional and non-conventional definitions. Non-conventional definitions take a concept like the aesthetic as an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>characteristic</b> in order to account for the phenomena of art. Conventional definitions reject this connection to aesthetic, formal, or expressive properties as essential to defining art but rather, in either an institutional or historical sense, say that “art” is basically a sociological category. In terms of classificatory disputes about art, Danto takes a conventional approach. His [...] "institutional definition of art" [...] considers whatever art schools, museums, and artists get away with, regardless of formal definitions. Danto has written on this subject in several of his recent works and a detailed treatment is to be found in Transfiguration of the Commonplace.|$|E
40|$|In birds, the {{environmental}} variables and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{of the nest}} have important fitness consequences through its influence on the selection of nesting sites. However, {{the extent to which}} these variables interact with variables that operate at the landscape scale, and whether there is a hierarchy among the different scales that influences nest-site selection, is unknown. This interaction could be crucial in burrowing birds, which depend heavily on the availability of suitable nesting locations. One representative of this group is the burrowing parrot, Cyanoliseus patagonus that breeds on specific ravines and forms large breeding colonies. At a particular site, breeding aggregations require the concentration of adequate environmental elements for cavity nesting, which are provided by within ravine <b>characteristics.</b> Therefore, <b>intrinsic</b> ravine <b>characteristics</b> should be more important in determining nest site selection compared to landscape level characteristics. Here, we assess this hypothesis by comparing the importance of ravine characteristics operating at different scales on nest-site selection and their interrelation with reproductive success. We quantified 12 characteristics of 105 ravines in their reproductive habitat. For each ravine we quantified morphological variables, distance to resources and disturbance as well as nest number and egg production in order to compare selected and non-selected ravines and determine the interrelationship among variables in explaining ravine differences. In addition, the number of nests and egg production for each reproductive ravine was related to ravine characteristics to assess their relation to reproductive success. We found significant differences between non-reproductive and reproductive ravines in both <b>intrinsic</b> and extrinsic <b>characteristics.</b> The multidimensional environmental gradient of variation between ravines, however, shows that differences are mainly related to <b>intrinsic</b> morphological <b>characteristics</b> followed by extrinsic variables associated to human disturbance. Likewise, within reproductive ravines, <b>intrinsic</b> <b>characteristics</b> are more strongly related to the number of nests. The probability of producing eggs, however, was related only to distance to roads and human settlements. Patterns suggest that C. patagonus mainly selects nesting sites based on <b>intrinsic</b> morphological <b>characteristics</b> of ravines. Scale differences in the importance of ravine characteristics could be a consequence of the particular orography of the breeding habitat. The arrangement of resources is associated to the location of the gullies rather than to individual ravines, determining the spatial availability and disposition of resources and disturbances. Thus, nest selection is influenced by <b>intrinsic</b> <b>characteristics</b> that maximize the fitness of individuals. Scaling in nest-selection is discussed under an optimality approach that partitions patch selection based on foraging theory...|$|R
