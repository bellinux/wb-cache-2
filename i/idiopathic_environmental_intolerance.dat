40|$|Multiple {{chemical}} sensitivities (MCS) syndrome, {{also known}} as <b>idiopathic</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerance,</b> is a controversial diagnosis that encompasses {{a wide range of}} waxing and waning, subjective symptoms referable to more than one body system and provoked by exposure to low levels of chemicals, foods, or other agents in the environment. Although MCS has been studied extensively, a unifying mechanism explaining the illness remains obscure, and clinicians are divided as to whether such a medical entity exists separately from psychosomatic syndromes. MCS is an adult diagnosis; there is little reference to pediatric cases in the scientific literature. In this case from the Pediatric Environmental Health Subspecialty Unit at Boston’s Children’s Hospital, I present the case of a preschool child who had suffered from milk allergy and poor weight gain as an infant, and then later developed asthma, allergic symptoms, sinusitis, headaches, fatigue, and rashes precipitated by an expanding variety of chemicals, foods, and allergens. I review definitions, mechanisms, diagnostic strategies, and management, and discuss some uniquely pediatric features of MCS as illustrated by this case.

However, at 60 days of exposure, there were significant decreases in amino transaminases and did not cause any significant stress in bilirubin. The intracellular level of lipid peroxidation as measured by malondiadehyde in the liver and kidney decreased by 15 % and 43 %, respectively. There was no difference in level of cholesterol at 40 days of exposure while the increased levels at 60 days were not significant.

40|$|Multiple {{chemical}} sensitivity (MCS) is {{a common}} condition, characterized by somatic distress upon exposure to odors. As in other <b>idiopathic</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerances,</b> the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Contrary to the expectations it was recently found that persons with MCS activate the odor-processing brain regions less than controls, while their activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is increased. The present follow-up {{study was designed to}} test the hypotheses that MCS subjects have increased harm avoidance and deviations in the serotonin system, which could render them intolerant to environmental odors. Twelve MCS and 11 control subjects, age 22 - 44, all working or studying females, were included in a PET study where 5 -HT(1 A) receptor binding potential (BP) was assessed after bolus injection of [(11) C]WAY 100635. Psychological profiles were assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory and the Swedish universities Scales of Personality. All MCS and 12 control subjects were also tested for emotional startle modulation in an acoustic startle test. MCS subjects exhibited significantly increased harm avoidance, and anxiety compared to controls. They also had a reduced 5 -HT(1 A) receptor BP in amygdala (p = 0. 029), ACC (p = 0. 005) (planned comparisons, significance level 0. 05), and insular cortex (p = 0. 003; significance level p< 0. 005 with Bonferroni correction), and showed an inverse correlation between degree of anxiety and the BP in the amygdala (planned comparison). No group by emotional category difference was found in the startle test. Increased harm avoidance and the observed changes in the 5 -HT(1 A) receptor BP in the regions processing harm avoidance provides a plausible pathophysiological ground for the symptoms described in MCS, and yields valuable information for our general understanding of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerances...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractPatients {{suffering}} from <b>Idiopathic</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Intolerances</b> (IEI) report health symptoms, referable to multiple organ systems, which are triggered by harmless odors and therefore medically unexplainable. In line {{with previous research}} that predominantly points towards psychological explanations, the present study tests the hypothesis that IEI symptoms result from learning via classical conditioning of odors to fear. A differential conditioning paradigm was employed. Hedonically different odors were compared on ease of fear acquisition. Conditioned stimuli (CSs) were Dimethyl Sulfide (unpleasant) and peach (pleasant). The unconditioned stimulus (US) was an electrical shock. During acquisition one odor (CS+) was followed by shock, while the other odor (CS−) was not. Next, fear extinction was tested by presenting both CS+ and CS− without US. Electrodermal response, odor evaluation, and sniffing behavior were monitored. Results showed successful fear conditioning irrespective of hedonic character as evidenced by electrodermal response. Acquired fear did not extinguish. There {{was no evidence of}} evaluative conditioning taking place, as CS evaluation did not change during fear acquisition. Early avoidance of the CS+, as deduced from odor inhalation measures, was demonstrated, but did not sustain during the entire acquisition phase.

40|$|Objective: <b>Idiopathic</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerance</b> (IEI), {{also known}} as {{multiple}} chemical sensitivity, is a chronic, polysymptomatic condition that cannot be explained by an organic disease. Physical and psychological complaints {{are believed to be}} sustained by low levels of chemically unrelated substances in the environment. At present, it is unclear whether IEI is an environmental illness or a variant of somatoform disorders (SFD). This study examined whether IEI can be distinguished from SFD with respect to self-reported symptoms, trait anxiety, body-related cognitions, and symptom attributions. Methods:We compared 54 subjects with IEI, 54 subjects with SFD but without IEI, and 44 subjects with neither IEI nor SFD on symptom scales, psychological questionnaires, and structured interviews for IEI, depression, anxiety, and SFD. Results: More than half of the IEI subjects met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria of SFD. This group shared both symptoms and psychological features of somatization with the SFD group. IEI subjects who did not fulfill criteria for a specific SFD were less impaired by their chemical sensitivity but differed nevertheless from nonsomatoform controls by significantly higher symptom scores, higher trait anxiety, a focus on autonomic sensations, and more pronounced somatic symptom attributions. These psychological features were significantly associated with the burden of somatic symptoms in both SFD and IEI. Furthermore, self-reported allergy but not total immunoglobulin E correlated with symptom burden in the total sample. Conclusions: The similarity of IEI and SFD regarding symptoms and psychological features of somatization support the hypothesis that IEI is a variant of SFD.

No study to date has used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain activation in IEI. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether individuals with IEI during chemosensory exposure activate brain circuitries associated with negative emotional processing and to examine if they sensitize to chemosensory stimuli. Brain activation was studied with fMRI in 26 female subjects with IEI and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls during exposure to olfactory and chemosomatosensory stimuli. Stimuli were presented in a blocked design with intensity ratings during each block. Subjects with IEI showed increased activation in amygdala, insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dorsal prefrontal cortex during exposure to carbon dioxide. In addition, they showed decreased activation in medial refrontal cortex. These results imply negative emotional processing in IEI that is similar to what is seen in anxiety disorders.

Patients and controls had similar distributions of NOS 2 A Ser 608 Leu and NOS 3 − 786 T>C polymorphisms.

Moreover, a short number of (CCTTT) repeats is associated with higher concentrations of nitrites/nitrates.

A genetic predisposition to altered biotransformation of environmental chemicals, drugs, and metals, and of endogenous low-molecular weight metabolites, caused by polymorphisms of genes coding for xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, their receptors and transcription factors appears {{to be involved in the}} susceptibility to these environment-associated pathologies, along with epigenetic factors. Free radical/antioxidant homeostasis may also be heavily implicated, indirectly by affecting the regulation of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, and directly by causing increased levels of oxidative products, implicated in the chronic damage of cells and tissues, which is in part correlated with clinical symptoms. More systematic studies of molecular epidemiology, toxico- and pharmaco-genomics, elucidating the mechanisms of regulation, expression, induction, and activity of antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes, and the possible role of inflammatory mediators, promise a better understanding of this pathologically increased sensitivity to low-level chemical stimuli, and a solid basis for effective individualized antioxidant- and/or chelator-based treatments...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{possible}} early determinants of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerance</b> (IEI), contributing to an integrated model for the development of IEI. Questionnaires concerning personality traits, current mental distress, subjective health complaints, work load and satisfaction, and options for recovery, were given to 84 persons from the general population attributing annoyance to (i) chemicals/smells (smell-annoyed (SA) n= 29); (ii) electrical equipment (electrically annoyed (EA) n= 16); and (iii) both smells and electricity (generally annoyed [GA] n= 39), but otherwise healthy and in active work. Compared to referents (n= 54), the EA and GA groups showed strongly elevated scores on 5 / 6 scales within the trait anxiety/ neuroticism personality dimension, while the SA group had a slight elevation on only one anxiety scale. Current mental distress and subjective health complaints scores were generally elevated in the EA and GA groups, but only partially in the SA group. Higher proportions of the EA, GA, and SA groups reported low satisfaction with their work situation, including more frequent fatigue after work and a higher, and often unfulfilled, need for recovery.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Idiopathic</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerance</b> (IEI) has in {{cross-sectional}} studies {{been associated}} with emotional problems and psychiatric disorders. However, {{in the absence of}} prospective studies it has not been possible to determine whether emotional problems precede the onset of IEI, or are a consequence of IEI. The {{purpose of this study was}} to address this issue in a prospective panel study design. Methods: The study sample (n= 10 275) responded to a postal survey that included five questions regarding annoyance from environmental factors, at baseline and at follow-up five years later. Associations between a number of self-rating scales of stress, subjective health, and working conditions at baseline on one hand, and development of environmental annoyance from baseline to follow-up on the other, were examined. Results: Participants having developed environmental annoyance between baseline and follow-up had at baseline reported more subjective health complaints, higher levels of stress, strain, and lack of recovery, more dissatisfaction with their work situation, and lower personal social support, compared to participants not developing environmental annoyance. Conclusion: Elevated subjective health complaints, high stress in daily life and a strained work situation, all possible signs of sustained arousal, increase the risk of developing annoyance to environmental factors. The results fit the hypothesis that reduced subjective health, over the course of time, may be attributed to environmental factors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

Methods: Diluted ammonia and acetic acid served as conditional odor cues (CSs) in a differential associative learning paradigm. Hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia (unconditional stimulus [US]) was used to induce lightheadedness. In a training phase, participants (n 28) performed three hypocapnic and three normocapnic overbreathing trials of 60 seconds each. One odor was consistently paired with the hypocapnic overbreathing (CS); the other (control) odor was paired with normocapnic overbreathing (CS). In the test phase, each odor was presented once during spontaneous breathing and once during normocapnic overventilation. Lightheadedness was assessed online during each breathing trial, which was followed by an extensive hyperventilation symptom checklist. Fractional end-tidal CO 2, breathing frequency, and inspiratory volume were measured throughout the experiment. Results: In the test phase, participants experienced lightheadedness more quickly {{in response to the}} odor that had been paired with hypocapnic overbreathing compared with the control odor. They also scored higher on the symptom “feeling unreal. ” Conclusion: Lightheadedness in response to odors can be acquired easily.

In this study, a cohort of 18 MCS patients underwent transient-evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) testing with and without contralateral suppression to evaluate the functionality of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex involved in speech-in-noise sensitivity. Results were compared with an age- and gender-matched control group (n = 20) and correlation analysis with disease onset and quick environmental exposure sensitivity inventory (qEESI) symptom severity scale was performed. Subjects affected by MCS showed statistically significant impairment of MOC reflex, and the onset of the disease and several symptom subscales showed to be correlated to such reduction in some of the frequencies tested.

Methods: Correlations and regression analysis to compare {{a sample of the}} general population recruited via internet panel to individuals with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerance</b> to EMF (IEIEMF) recruited via an interest group. Results: The general population sensitive group was more similar to the non-sensitive group in personal characteristics than to the NGO sensitive group. They experienced more - and more frequent - non-specific symptoms, reported higher perceived risk of EMF, and attributed their symptoms more to EMF than the non-sensitive group, but less than the NGO sensitive group. There was a positive association between attribution of symptoms to EMF and reported intensity of non-specific symptoms, which was stronger for the NGO sensitive subjects than for the general population. Conclusions: People sensitive to EMF and recruited via an internet panel differ from people sensitive to EMF and recruited via an NGO, who reported a higher frequency of non-specific symptoms.

40|$|People {{suffering}} from <b>idiopathic</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerance</b> attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF) experience numerous non-specific symptoms that they attribute to EMF. The {{cause of this}} condition remains vague and evidence shows that psychological rather than bioelectromagnetic mechanisms are at work. We hypothesized a role of media reports in the etiology of IEI-EMF and investigated how somatosensory perception is affected. 65 healthy participants were instructed that EMF exposure can lead to enhanced somatosensory perception. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} watch either a television report on adverse health effects of EMF or a neutral report. During the following experiment, participants rated stimulus intensities of tactile (electric) stimuli while being exposed to a sham WiFi signal in 50 % of the trials. Sham WiFi exposure led to increased intensity ratings of tactile stimuli in the WiFi film group, especially in participants with higher levels of somatosensory amplification. Participants of the WiFi group reported more anxiety concerning WiFi exposure than the Control group and tended to perceive themselves as being more sensitive to EMF after the experiment compared to before. Sensational media reports can facilitate enhanced perception of tactile stimuli in healthy participants. People tending to perceive bodily symptoms as intense, disturbing, and noxious seem most vulnerable.

40|$|Asthma and allergies {{are some}} of the most common {{illnesses}} worldwide that almost everybody will come in contact with. This thesis studied persons with allergic asthma, non-allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in a population-based sample. At an early stage, these illnesses were regarded as psychosomatic. Over time, as knowledge about asthma/allergy has increased more of a biomedical perspective was taken by the research field. In considering early documentations well as contemporary research, a psychobiosocial perspective was taken in this thesis when conducting the three studies. Thus, as psychological factors may affect the illness and be a result of the illness, it is important to incorporate these factors to better understand asthma and allergy. Study I examined the co- and multimorbidity in asthma/allergy with the <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerances</b> in the form of chemical and building-related intolerance. Study II investigated psychological distress in the four forms of asthma and allergy. Psychological distress was in this study defined as stress, burnout, anxiety, depression and environmental health worries. Study III examined usage of problem and emotion focused coping strategies and perceived social support from the surrounding in high and low asthma/allergy severity. All studies were performed using data from the Västerbotten Environmental Health Study, a questionnaire-based survey with focus on various environmental hypersensitivities and asthma and allergy. The result showed that the co- and multimorbidity with the <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerances</b> in asthma/allergy was larger than what was statistically excepted. Those with allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis experienced more stress, burnout and anxiety than those with non-allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis and non-asthma/allergy. Moreover, the most common way of coping with asthma and allergy was found to be strategies such as avoiding environments that are believed to affect health, and trying to accept the situation, independent of asthma/allergy severity. Finally, in general, those with asthma and allergy reported receiving most support from their partner, other family members and health care, and least support was perceived by those with low asthma/allergy severity. The findings suggest that co- and multimorbidity with <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerances</b> is relatively common in asthma and allergy, and should therefore be included in the clinical anamnesis for this patient group. The elevated level of distress in allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis evokes the question of use of therapies such as mindfulness maybe beneficial in certain afflicted persons. The results on coping and social support provide a foundation for further research regarding informing the asthma/allergy patient and family members about effective coping strategies and the importance of adequate social support.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and impact of aromatherapy massage for individuals with IEI. Design: Non-blinded crossover trial Setting: IEI patients who attended a clinic in Sapporo city were recruited, and sixteen patients were enrolled. Participants were clinically examined by an experienced medical doctor and met the criteria included in the working definition of IEI disorder. Interventions: During the active period, participants received four one-hour aromatherapy massage sessions every two weeks. During the control period, the participants did not receive any massages. Main outcome measurements: Scores on the IEI-scales trigger checklist, symptoms, life impact, and the State Anxiety Inventory were assessed before and after each period. Short-term mood enhancement was evaluated using the Profiles of Mood Status (POMS) before and after sessions.

This study aimed to assess NSPS in people with general environmental sensitivity (GES) and <b>idiopathic</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerance</b> attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF) and to determine differences in functional status and illness behavior. Methods: An epidemiological study was conducted in the Netherlands, combining self-administered questionnaires with the electronic medical records of the respondents as registered by general practitioners. Analyses included n = 5789 registered adult (≥ 18 years) patients, comprising 5073 non-sensitive (NS) individuals, 514 in the GES group and 202 in the IEI-EMF group. Results: Participants with GES were about twice as likely to consult alternative therapy compared to non-sensitive individuals; those with IEI-EMF were more than three times as likely. Moreover, there was a higher prevalence of symptoms and medication prescriptions and longer symptom duration among people with sensitivities. Increasing number and duration of self-reported NSPS were associated with functional impairment, illness behavior, negative symptom perceptions and prevalence of GP-registered NSPS in the examined groups. Conclusion: Even after adjustment for medical and psychiatric morbidity, environmentally sensitive individuals experience poorer health, increased illness behavior and more severe NSPS. The number and duration of self-reported NSPS are important components of symptom severity and are associated with characteristics similar to those of NSPS in primary care. The substantial overlap between the sensitive groups strengthens the notion that different types of sensitivities might be part of one, broader environmental illness. (aut. ref. ...|$|E

The objective {{of this paper is}} to describe the suffering in individuals with MCS and to assess the disease's impact on each measured dimension of suffering by means of a descriptive and correlational study. A sample of 125 subjects fill out a survey consisting of three scales for assessing the impact of MCS and three scales for assessing suffering. The results show that MCS affects mostly women. Assessment with the Quick Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory (QEESI) showed that participants have high levels of disease. The physical sphere of suffering is the most affected, followed by the psychological and the existential. There are high correlations between the QEESI and suffering scales. A multivariate regression equation explained 38. 2 % of the variance of suffering observed. We conclude that MCS generates physical, psychological, and existential suffering. Severity of symptoms is the variable that generates most suffering, followed by life impact. Psychological distress is marked by anxiety or worry and lack of gaiety; existential suffering reveals thoughts of failure and lack of inner harmony. A detailed description of suffering in MCS is a useful basis for therapy. Lack of awareness among health-care personnel implies inattention of these patients within the general health-care service.

40|$|Multiple {{chemical}} sensitivity/idiopathic <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerance</b> (MCS/IEI) is {{a commonly}} used diagnostic {{term for a}} group of symptoms. These symptoms have been described and commented on for more than 15 years in the USA. Recently, it has also been observed in Japan. The main features of this syndrome are multiple symptoms involving in multiple organ systems that are precipitated by a variety of chemical substances with relapses and exacerbation under certain conditions when exposed to very low levels which do not affect the population at large. There are no laboratory markers or specific investigative findings. Although traditional medical organizations have not agreed on a definition for this syndrome {{due to the lack of}} obvious evidence to demonstrate the existence of these symptoms, it is being increasingly recognized. It constitutes an increasing percentage of the caseload at occupational/environmental medical clinics...|$|R
40|$|Psychological {{factors have}} been implicated in the {{etiology}} of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>environmental</b> illness in many studies. Few studies have ever reported psychiatric morbidity among individuals with electromagnetic hypersensitivity. We aimed to estimate the prevalence and identify the associated factors of self-reported electromagnetic field sensitivity (SREMFS) in adults of Taiwan. Methods: A total of 1251 adults selected from a nationwide Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing system received a telephone survey about the perception of risk from various environmental agents and their effects on health and well-being. Results: The estimated prevalence of people with SREMFS was 13. 3 % (95 % confidence interval: 11. 2 – 15. 3). People aged > 65 years were associated with a lower risk of reporting sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, whereas people with a very poor self-reported health status, those who were unable to work, {{and those who had}} psychiatric morbidity were associated with a higher risk of having SREMFS. Conclusion: The prevalence of SREMFS in the general population of Taiwan is higher than that reported in western countries. People with psychiatric morbidity are more likely to report sensitivity to electromagnetic fields. The cross-sectional design precludes the causal inference of all identified correlates and electromagnetic field sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIdiopathic <b>Environmental</b> <b>Intolerance</b> {{attributed}} to Electromagnetic Fields (IEI-EMF) {{is a condition}} in which symptoms are {{attributed to}} electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure. As electro-hypersensitive (EHS) people have repeatedly been observed, during provocation trials, to report symptoms following perceived rather than actual exposure, the hypothesis has been put forward that IEI-EMF originates from psychological mechanisms, especially nocebo responses. This paper examines this hypothesis, using data from a qualitative study aimed at understanding how EHS people come to regard themselves as such. Forty self-diagnosed EHS people were interviewed. A typified model of their attribution process was then elaborated, inductively, from their narratives. This model is linear and composed of seven stages: (1) onset of symptoms; (2) failure to find a solution; (3) discovery of EHS; (4) gathering of information about EHS; (5) implicit appearance of conviction; (6) experimentation; (7) conscious acceptance of conviction. Overall, symptoms appear before subjects start questioning effects of EMF on their health, which is not consistent with the hypothesis that IEI-EMF originates from nocebo responses to perceived EMF exposure. However, such responses might occur at the sixth stage of the process, potentially reinforcing the attribution. It remains possible that some cases of IEI-EMF originate from other psychological mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Scientific {{publications}} on electromagnetic hypersensitivity {{began in}} the early 80 ' and were first related to video display terminals in the professional environment. Electromagnetic hypersensitivity is now more heterogeneous and complaints about electromagnetic fields (EMF) are often associated to mobile phone or wifi. Provocation studies did not find that persons claiming to have electromagnetic hypersensitivity were more able to detect EMF than others or that they displayed any special physiological changes when exposed to EMF. Since 1996, WHO defined this syndrome as <b>Idiopathic</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Intolerance</b> to ElectroMagnetic Fields (IEI-EMF), characterised by symptoms attributed to EMF. The diagnostic is made by the person itself. The symptoms are heterogeneous and are frequently encountered in the general population. Despite the lack of a proven causal relationship with EMF, these symptoms, and the anxiety related, can lead to important suffering. Some persons with IEI-EMF are even unable to work. IEI-EMF is classified among the functional somatic syndromes as other syndromes with no physiological basis (as multiple chemical sensitivity). Directive and IEI-EMF Studies showed that persons who feel more stressed in their professional environment and are less satisfied with their work are more prone to IEI-EMF. There are some elements in the directive that could frighten these persons: the directive does not consider long term effects; the limit values can be exceeded temporarily and a worker must be informed that he can have transient symptoms. Discussion Persons with IEI-EMF are afraid of adverse health effects and often think that these effects are not taken into account by official agency. For them, everything that can aggravate their fears will be difficult to handle. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{tendency}} of experiencing unpleasant symptoms in {{the proximity of}} working electric devices is called <b>idiopathic</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerance</b> attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF). Evidence about psychophysiological backgrounds of the phenomenon (i. e., detection ability and mechanisms of symptom generation) is not yet conclusive. METHODS: Participants of the provocation experiment were 29 individuals with self-reported IEI-EMF and 42 control persons. Participants completed questionnaires (symptom expectations, somatosensory amplification - SSAS, modern health worries radiation subscale - MHW-R), and attempted to detect the presence of 50 Hz 0. 5 mT magnetic field (MF) directed to their right arm in 20 subsequent 1 -min sessions. Heart rate was also recorded and various indices of heart rate variability (HF, LF/HF, SDNN) were calculated. RESULTS: Using the methodology of the signal detection theory, individuals with IEI-EMF {{as opposed to the}} control group showed a higher than random detection performance (d' differed slightly but statistically significantly from zero), and they used a significantly lower criterion (β value) when deciding about the presence of the MF. Detection sessions followed by correct decisions (hits or correct rejections) were characterized by higher HRV (SDNN and HF indices) than periods followed by errors (misses or false alarms). Previous expectations and affiliation to the IEI-EMF group were significant predictors of symptoms reported following exposure. IEI-EMF was closely related to MHW-R and SSAS scores. CONCLUSION: Detection of MF might be possible for people with IEI-EMF to some extent. Although heightened sensibility to MFs {{may play a role in}} the development and/or in the perpetuance of the IEI-EMF phenomenon, symptoms attributed to the MF seem to be mainly of psychogenic origin.

40|$|Background: There is {{continuing}} scientific debate and increasing public concern regarding the possible effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) on general population's health. To date, no epidemiological study has investigated the possible association between actual and perceived EMF exposure and non-specific physical symptoms (NSPS) and sleep quality, using both self-reported and general practice (GP) -registered data. Methods: A health survey of adult (≥ 18) participants (n = 5933) in the Netherlands was {{combined with the}} electronic medical records (EMRs) of NSPS as registered by general practitioners. Characterization of actual exposure was based on several proxies, such as prediction models of radiofrequency (RF) -EMF exposure, geo-coded distance to high-voltage overhead power lines and self-reported use/distance of/to indoor electrical appliances. Perceived exposure {{and the role of}} psychological variables were also examined. Results: Perceived exposure had a poor correlation with the actual exposure estimates. No significant association was found between modeled RF-EMF exposure and the investigated outcomes. Associations with NSPS were observed for use of an electric blanket and close distance to an electric charger during sleep. Perceived exposure, perceived control and avoidance behavior were associated with the examined outcomes. The association between perceived exposure was stronger for self-reported than for GP-registered NSPS. There was some indication, but no consistent pattern for an interaction between <b>idiopathic</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerance</b> (IEI-EMF) and the association between actual exposure and NSPS. Conclusions: In conclusion, there is no convincing evidence for an association between everyday life RF-EMF exposure and NSPS and sleep quality in the population. Better exposure characterization, in particular with respect to sources of extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) is needed to draw more solid conclusions. We argue that perceived exposure is an independent determinant of NSPS. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|Data {{from two}} {{previous}} studies were aggregated {{to provide a}} statistically powerful test of whether exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produced by telecommunication base stations negatively affects well-being in individuals who report <b>idiopathic</b> <b>environmental</b> illness with attribution to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF) and control participants. A total of 102 IEI-EMF and 237 controls participated in open provocation trials and 88 IEI-EMF and 231 controls went on to complete double-blind trials {{in which they were}} exposed to EMFs from a base station emitting either a Global System for Mobile Communication and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System or a Terrestrial Trunked Radio Telecommunications System signal. Both experiments included a comparison sham condition. Visual analog and symptom scales measured subjective well-being. Results showed that IEI-EMF participants reported lower levels of well-being during real compared to sham exposure during open provocation, but not during double-blind trials. Additionally, participants reported lower levels of well-being during high compared to low load trials and this did not interact with radiofrequency-EMF exposure. These findings are consistent with a growing body of literature indicating there is no causal relationship between short-term exposure to EMFs and subjective well-being in members of the public whether or not they report perceived sensitivity to EMFs...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{exposures}} to very {{low levels of}} airborne chemicals are associated with adverse symptoms, often affecting multiple organ systems, in the phenomenon of chemical sensitivity (CS). Recent surveys suggest a significant prevalence of chemically sensitive subjects in the United States, but the mechanism linking exposure to symptoms remains unclear, despite the advancement {{of a variety of}} theoretical models. In many of these models, exposure of the nasal respiratory system to an airborne agent {{is the first step in}} the pathway leading to symptoms. In this article, we advance the hypothesis that interactions between environmental chemicals and the vomeronasal organ (VNO) may play a role in the etiology of CS. The VNO, a bilateral, tubular organ located in the nose, serves in animals as part of a sensitive chemosensory system; however, evidence suggesting that the VNO retains a functional role in the adult human is controversial. Reported characteristics of the human VNO relevant to CS, including location, prevalence, selective sensitivity to airborne chemical exposure, and capacity to produce systemic effects, are discussed within the context of this ongoing debate. Beyond relevance to CS, the demonstration of an active, adult VNO could have significant impact on environmental toxicology.

40|$|BACKGROUND: High {{concomitant}} intolerance {{attributed to}} odorous/pungent chemicals, certain buildings, electromagnetic fields (EMF), and everyday sounds {{calls for a}} questionnaire instrument that can assess symptom prevalence in various <b>environmental</b> <b>intolerances.</b> The <b>Environmental</b> Hypersensitivity Symptom Inventory (EHSI) was therefore developed and metrically evaluated, and normative data were established. The EHSI consists of 34 symptom items, requires limited time to respond to, and provides a detailed and broad description of the individual's symptomology. METHODS: Data from 3406 individuals {{who took part in}} the Vasterbotten Environmental Health Study were used. The participants constitute a random sample of inhabitants in the county of Vasterbotten in Sweden, aged 18 to 79 years, stratified for age and gender. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis identified five significant factors: airway symptoms (9 items; Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 coefficient, KR- 20, of internal consistency = 0. 74), skin and eye symptoms (6 items; KR- 20 = 0. 60), cardiac, dizziness and nausea symptoms (4 items; KR- 20 = 0. 55), head-related and gastrointestinal symptoms (5 items; KR- 20 = 0. 55), and cognitive and affective symptoms (10 items; KR- 20 = 0. 80). The KR- 20 was 0. 85 for the entire 34 -item EHSI. Symptom prevalence rates in percentage for having the specific symptoms every week over the preceding three months constitute normative data. CONCLUSIONS: The EHSI can be recommended for assessment of symptom prevalence in various types of environmental hypersensitivity, and with the advantage of comparing prevalence rates with normality...|$|R
