5|$|Having won two Michelin {{stars at}} the {{restaurant}} Harveys, chef Marco Pierre White felt restricted {{in the size of}} the premises as he sought to challenge for a third star. He was introduced to Rocco <b>Forte,</b> chairman of Rocco <b>Forte</b> Hotels, by actor Michael Caine. <b>Forte</b> had begun entering into arrangements with Michelin starred chefs, with Nico Ladenis holding stars at Chez Nico within Forte's Grosvenor House Hotel in Mayfair.|$|E
5|$|At 21:30 <b>Forte</b> and the {{captured}} merchant ships were visible from Sybille, <b>Forte</b> brilliantly illuminated {{in the tropical}} night. Cooke brought Sybille westwards {{in order to take}} the weather gage before wearing and bearing down on the French ship, under a light wind from the southwest. Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on <b>Forte</b> but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: he seems to have thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} {{hour and a half}} the frigates poured shot into one another at close range, until Cooke was struck by grape shot at 01:30 on 1 March, {{replaced}} by his first lieutenant Lucius Hardyman. For another hour the action continued, French fire gradually slackening until it stopped completely at 02:30, by which time only four French guns remained operational. Hardyman hailed to ask whether <b>Forte</b> had surrendered but the French did not reply and he ordered another broadside. A second hail also brought no response but sailors were seen attempting to repair the rigging on <b>Forte.</b> Concerned that the French were attempting to escape, Hardyman concentrated his fire on the masts of <b>Forte,</b> bringing them crashing down one by one until at 03:00 <b>Forte</b> was completely dismasted. With all resistance ended, British merchant prisoners on board <b>Forte</b> emerged from below decks and hailed Sybille, requesting a boat be sent across so that British Lieutenant Nicholas Manger could formally take the surrender of the French ship.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{criticisms of}} <b>Forte's</b> {{nomenclature}} are: (1) <b>Forte's</b> labels are arbitrary {{and difficult to}} memorize, {{and it is in}} practice often easier simply to list an element of the set class; (2) <b>Forte's</b> system assumes equal temperament and cannot easily be extended to include diatonic sets, pitch sets (as opposed to pitch-class sets), multisets or sets in other tuning systems; (3) <b>Forte's</b> original system considers inversionally related sets to belong to the same set-class. This means that, for example a major triad and a minor triad are considered the same set.|$|R

5|$|<b>Forte</b> Tre Sassi (or <b>Forte</b> Tra i Sassi) is a {{fortress}} constructed in 1897 during the Austro-Hungarian period on the Passo Valparola. It lies between Sass de Stria and Piccolo Lagazuoi, dominating the passage between the Passo Falzarego and Val Badia in South Tyrol (Alto Adige). It {{was part of}} the large complex of Austrian fortifications built on the Italian border {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|After Sercey {{returned}} to Île de France his squadron broke up. Four ships were {{sent back to}} France in 1797 and 1798 as Île de France could no longer supply repairs, manpower or provisions in support of Sercey. This dispersal of the squadron was encouraged by the Colonial Assembly of Île de France and Governor Malartic neither of whom were well-disposed to the Directory then ruling France. With his remaining crews becoming rebellious, Sercey sent <b>Forte</b> and Prudente on a commerce raiding operation during the autumn of 1798, during which they achieved some success in the Bay of Bengal. By the time this force {{returned to}} Île de France Sercey had sailed to Batavia, leaving instructions for <b>Forte</b> and Prudente to follow him. Malartic countermanded this order, seizing Prudente and selling the frigate to a privateer concern and ordering <b>Forte</b> to operate independently in the Bay of Bengal {{in the autumn of}} 1798. Sercey was furious, but could do nothing to alter Malartic's arrangements.|$|E
5|$|After {{meeting with}} Caine and <b>Forte,</b> White {{was taken to}} the grill {{restaurant}} at the Hyde Park Hotel. <b>Forte</b> was interested if White could transfer the Michelin stars from Harveys; White was open to this since Raymond Blanc had previously transferred two stars to Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons when he moved his restaurant from Summertown, Oxford. Following the agreement of Michelin, White left Harveys in July 1993; The Restaurant was opened at the Hyde Park Hotel less than two months later, on 14 September. The interior was decorated with paintings from White's own collection.|$|E

5|$|On Cutler's {{touchdown}} pass to Jeffery, he tied Sid Luckman for the most {{touchdown pass}}es in Bears history with 137. Defensively, Pernell McPhee recorded his fifth sack during the game, and {{he became the first}} Bears player since Brian Urlacher in 2000 to have at least five sacks and one interception in the first seven games. During the second half, Matt <b>Forte</b> suffered a knee injury, and along with Eddie Royal, were missed the following week's game. The loss of <b>Forte</b> had been crucial for the Bears, as he had been responsible for 32 percent of yards gained in 2015, the most among running backs.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, Brandon Marshall and Matt <b>Forte</b> {{were named}} to the 2014 Pro Bowl, the fewest number of Bears sent since 2009, when two were also sent, {{and the first time}} a Bears {{defensive}} player was not invited since 2004. On January 14, 2014, Marshall and <b>Forte</b> were {{named to the}} Pro Football Writers Association's All-NFC Team. On January 3, 2014, the Associated Press released its annual All-Pro team, with no Bears named. On January 9, 2014, Alshon Jeffery was named to the Pro Bowl after an injury to Calvin Johnson. Jeffery was later named the PFWA's Most Improved Player on January 17. On January 20, Tim Jennings and Kyle Long were named to the Pro Bowl, replacing Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks, who advanced to Super Bowl XLVIII and Mike Iupati suffered an injury, respectively. Long's invitation marked the first time a Bears rookie was invited since special teamer Johnny Knox in 2009, and the first offensive rookie since Gale Sayers in 1965. The four offensive Pro Bowlers are the most sent by the Bears since 1985, when Jim McMahon, Walter Payton, Jay Hilgenberg and Jim Covert were invited to the game. <b>Forte,</b> Marshall and Jeffery's invitations also marked the first time since 1985 the Bears sent multiple skill position players, and the most sent by the team since 1963 with Bill Wade, Joe Marconi and Mike Ditka. <b>Forte,</b> Marshall and Jeffery were eventually drafted in the fantasy draft by Team Rice, while Long and Jennings were assigned to Team Sanders. In the 22–21 victory for Team Rice, <b>Forte</b> ran for 31 yards on six attempts while catching three passes for 24 yards. Jeffery and Marshall recorded two and one catch for 22 and 21 yards, respectively. For Team Sanders, Jennings recorded three tackles, while Long assisted in shoving Cam Newton into the endzone.|$|E

5|$|Sercey's {{flagship}} {{during these}} operations was the 40-gun frigate <b>Forte.</b> <b>Forte,</b> commanded by the elderly Captain Hubert Le Loup de Beaulieu, {{had been built}} in 1794 based on the hull and frame of a ship of the line: the frigate weighed 1,400 tons bm, the largest purpose-built frigate at sea. The main battery of <b>Forte</b> consisted of 28 24-pounder long guns, only the second frigate ever built (after Pomone) which could manage such a heavy armament. This was augmented by fourteen 8-pounder long guns on the upper deck and eight 36-pounder carronades on the quarterdeck, totaling 52 heavy cannon complemented by eight 1-pounder swivel guns. Uniquely, {{the sides of the}} ship were lined with cork matting to prevent splinters while the more common precaution had been taken of stringing netting over the deck to protect the crew from falling debris. The ship was however weakened by an ill-disciplined crew, and Sercey had expressed doubts about the ability of the aged Beaulieu.|$|E
5|$|Spearheaded by {{the running}} back trio of Matt <b>Forte,</b> Jeremy Langford and Ka'Deem Carey, the Bears rushing attack ended the season sixth in rushing {{attempts}} with 469 and 11th in total rushing yards with 1,851. The group also ranked 11th {{in the league}} in rushing yards per game with 115.7. <b>Forte</b> led the three in attempts (218), yards (898) and yards per attempt (4.1) despite not playing in three due to injury, while Langford had the most touchdowns with six. Playing in eleven games, Carey scored twice on 43 attempts.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 28 February 1799 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} of the French Revolutionary Wars, fought off {{the mouth of the}} Hooghly River in the Bay of Bengal between the French frigate <b>Forte</b> and the Royal Navy frigate HMS Sybille. <b>Forte</b> was an exceptionally large and powerful ship engaged on a commerce raiding operation against British merchant shipping off the port of Calcutta in British India. To eliminate this threat, Sybille was sent from Madras in pursuit. Acting on information from released prisoners, Edward Cooke, captain of Sybille, was sailing off Balasore when distant gunfire alerted him to the presence of <b>Forte</b> on the evening of 28 February. The French frigate was discovered at anchor in the sandbanks {{at the mouth of the}} Hooghly with two recently captured British merchant ships.|$|E
