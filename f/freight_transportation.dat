5|$|The Travis Branch is {{a branch}} of the Staten Island Railway in New York City, that {{operates}} from Arlington Yard to Fresh Kills, which is used for <b>freight</b> <b>transportation</b> along the West Shore, Staten Island. The branch was built in 1928, in order to serve Gulf Oil along the Arthur Kill, and was built south from Arlington Yard into the marshes of the island's western shore to Gulfport. In 1957, the line was extended to Travis in order to serve the newly built Consolidated Edison power plant. In 2005, the Travis Branch was being renovated and was extended from the old Consolidated Edison plant to the New York Sanitation dump at Fresh Kills. Regular service to the facility began in April 2007. A proposed route alignment for light rail on the west shore of Staten Island would have the light rail go on the North Shore rail right-of-way to the Travis Branch of the line, and from there, onto the median of the West Shore Expressway.|$|E

He was a {{transport}} {{entrepreneur who}} developed the modern intermodal shipping container, which revolutionized transport and international trade {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century. Containerization led to a significant reduction in the cost of <b>freight</b> <b>transportation</b> by eliminating the need for repeated handling of individual pieces of cargo, and also improved reliability, reduced cargo theft, and cut inventory costs by shortening transit time.|$|E
25|$|An NLRB {{injunction}} forbade ILA {{leaders from}} striking or disrupting <b>freight</b> <b>transportation.</b> Violence erupted as the IBL, {{facilitated by the}} police and Beck's Teamsters, smashed picket lines. Then the NLRBexaminer effectively overturned the December elections. This proved to be the last straw, for less than a week later, Bradley made the ILA strike official. Other unions and workers gave their complete support to the ILA, including a major Teamsters local, which indicated Beck's opposition to the ILA strikers was not shared {{throughout the rest of the}} Teamsters.|$|E
25|$|Since 1950, {{the railway}} system's {{market share of}} <b>freight</b> <b>transportation</b> dropped from 70% to ~55% (1960), ~25% (1970), ~10% (1980, 1990) and to less than 10% in 2000.

This was partly due to major investment and expansion in the road network.|$|E

25|$|Some {{historical}} {{forms of}} public transport include the stagecoach, traveling a fixed route from coaching inn to coaching inn, and the horse-drawn boat carrying paying passengers, {{which was a}} feature of European canals from their 17th-century origins. The canal itself {{as a form of}} infrastructure dates back to antiquity – ancient Egyptians certainly used a canal for <b>freight</b> <b>transportation</b> to bypass the Aswan cataract – and the Chinese also built canals for water transportation {{as far back as the}} Warring States period which began in the 5th century BCE. Whether or not those canals were used for for-hire public transport remains unknown; the Grand Canal in China (begun in 486 BCE) served primarily for shipping grain.|$|E
25|$|Pipelines {{are part}} of the {{intermodal}} <b>freight</b> <b>transportation</b> network as they are the preferred mode of transporting gas and liquids. Often unrecognized by the general public due to their placement underground, pipelines contribute to freight transport and are critical to the economy. Compared to trucks and trains, pipelines are less damaging to the environment, less susceptible to theft and more economical, safe, convenient and reliable. According to the American Association of Oil Pipelines, of a total oil transport of 6,400 Billion Board Miles (BBM), rail accounts for 2%, trucks 3%, water carriers 27% and pipelines 68% of all transport. In addition to oil, gas, liquid fertilizers, liquefied natural gas, and carbon dioxide are also transported by pipeline.|$|E
25|$|Freight trains {{operate on}} {{parts of the}} NEC through {{trackage}} rights. The Norfolk Southern Railway operates over the line south of Philadelphia. CSX Transportation has rights from New York to New Haven; in Massachusetts; and in Maryland from Landover, where its Landover Subdivision joins the NEC, and Bowie, where its Pope's Creek Subdivision leaves it. Between Philadelphia and New York, Conrail operates as a local switching and terminal company for CSX and Norfolk Southern (see Conrail Shared Assets Operations). The Providence and Worcester Railroad operates local freight service from New Haven into Rhode Island and has overhead trackage rights from New Haven to New York.

40|$|Efficient {{and correct}} freight train {{marshalling}} {{is vital for}} high quality carload <b>freight</b> <b>transportations.</b> During marshalling, it is desirable that cars are sorted according to their individual drop-off locations in the outbound freight trains. Furthermore, practical limitations such as non-uniform and limited track lengths and the arrival and departure times of trains need to be considered. This paper presents a novel optimisation method for freight marshalling scheduling under these circumstances. The method {{is based on an}} integer programming formulation that is solved using column generation and branch and price. The approach minimises the number of extra shunting operations that have to be performed, and is evaluated on real-world data from the Hallsberg marshalling yard in Sweden. RanPla...|$|R

25|$|The canal {{was a very}} {{efficient}} way of moving large amounts of heavy goods cheaply and with minimal labor. But White and Hazard had single-handedly spurred canal construction {{up and down the}} East Coast by taming the Lehigh River with navigations in less than two years, and four years ahead of promises to investors. Unfortunately, the northern canals would freeze in the winter, and their towpaths were muddy in spring and late fall. This made it impractical for a burgeoning mill town that needed year-round <b>freight</b> <b>transportation,</b> but if LC Co. was putting monies into railroads, other businessmen {{were going to have to}} take a hard careful look. With steamboat tugs proven on the Merrimack and Middlesex Canal themselves, and news of railroads building in Europe and now, the United States, investors would need to adopt new techniques sooner or miss opportunities.|$|E
25|$|As of August 2006, a {{total of}} 584 Twin Otter {{aircraft}} (all variants) remain in service worldwide. Major operators include: Libyan Arab Airlines (16), Maldivian Air Taxi (22), Trans Maldivian Airways (23), Kenn Borek Air (42) and Scenic Airlines (11). Some 115 airlines operate smaller numbers of the aircraft including Yeti Airlines in Nepal, Malaysia Airlines (which uses the Twin Otter exclusively for passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>transportation</b> to the Kelabit Highlands region in Sarawak), and in the United Kingdom, the FlyBe franchise operator Loganair which uses the aircraft to service the island of Barra in the Hebrides islands. This daily scheduled service is unique as the aircraft lands {{on the beach and}} the schedule is partly influenced by the tide tables. Trials in Barra with heavier planes than the Twin Otter, like the Short 360, failed because they sank in the sand. The Twin Otter is also used for landing at the world's shortest commercial runway on the Caribbean island of Saba, Netherlands Antilles.|$|E
25|$|Several rolling {{roads were}} {{established}} in Maryland in the early 18th century for the transportation of tobacco in casks, or hogsheads, from plantations to river ports. These casks were pulled along the road by slaves and later oxen before this method of <b>freight</b> <b>transportation</b> was made obsolete {{by the introduction of}} sturdy wagons. The rolling road in western Baltimore County connecting Rockdale with Elkridge, which was likely built in 1714 by William Summers, is the only such road in Maryland whose name survived to modern times. South Rolling Road was improved as a macadam road from Washington Boulevard (later US 1) to Frederick Road (later US 40 and now MD 144) by 1921. In St. Denis, the highway that was to become MD 166 followed modern Arlington Avenue and East Street south across a grade crossing of the B Railroad to its southern terminus at Washington Boulevard. MD 166 was moved to modern South Rolling Road when the highway's bridge over the railroad was built in 1931. By 1933, North Rolling Road was upgraded to an improved county highway. North Rolling Road would be expanded to a divided highway in Woodlawn around 1981. Unlike South Rolling Road, North Rolling Road has never {{been a part of the}} state highway system.|$|E
