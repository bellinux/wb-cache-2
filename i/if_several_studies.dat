In these debates local food networks are often portrayed as good examples of fair trade and as having potential to redefine {{the role of the}} consumer in the marketplace (or in commercial relations). Based on examination of the type of mechanisms used to enrol consumers in local and fair trade networks, we have distinguished two main kinds of consumers' involvement.

The second one is called "empowerment" and is based on contractual mechanisms between consumers and producers and on the construction of collective choices. This latter kind of consumer involvement points out the capacity of alternative food networks to empower consumers in a more broadly political sense...|$|E

40|$|Massive {{black holes}} have been {{discovered}} in all closely examined galaxies with high velocity dispersion. The case is not as clear for lower-dispersion systems such as low-mass galaxies and globular clusters. Here we suggest that above a critical velocity dispersion of roughly 40 km/s, massive central black holes will form in relaxed stellar systems at any cosmic epoch. This is because above this dispersion primordial binaries cannot support the system against deep core collapse. If, as previous simulations show, the black holes formed in the cluster settle to produce a dense subcluster, then given the extremely high densities reached during core collapse the holes will merge with each other. For low velocity dispersions and hence low cluster escape speeds, mergers will typically kick out all or {{all but one of}} the holes due to three-body kicks or the asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation. If one hole remains, it will tidally disrupt stars at a high rate. If none remain, one is formed after runaway collisions between stars, then it tidally disrupts stars at a high rate.

However, it continues to be endemic in many developing countries like Ethiopia. Even <b>if</b> <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> were conducted in different parts of Ethiopia, most of them did not show the independent predictors for rural and urban children separately.

These questionnaires have their origins in Western cultures such as the Australian science education community. This paper addresses the issues of translated questionnaires, illustrated by an example of problematic usage of the Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (CLES) in a Korean context. A doctoral {{study was conducted in}} which the CLES was administered to teachers and students in Korean senior high schools. We noticed that respondents struggled to make sense of items. Interviews revealed a serious mismatch between local cultural practices of Korean teachers and students and the cultural practices of the Australian CLES designers. The issue can be considered in two ways. First, even <b>if</b> <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> have obtained reasonable findings when using a translated questionnaire in cultural settings different from the place where the original questionnaire was developed, the findings do not guarantee that the translated items are semantically equivalent to the original items. Second, English-speaking researchers tend to presuppose unduly that cultural contexts embedded in the original questionnaire can be readily understood by respondents in non-English speaking contexts. We argue that translation of learning environment questionnaires for use in non-English speaking contexts should be extended beyond initial linguistic ‘back-translation’ procedures. An important next step is to ensure that the questionnaire exhibits meaningfully aspects of their own lived experiences. As an outcome, we suggest a way of adapting the CLES to the cultural context of Korean senior high schools...|$|E

A green roof is usually {{a more or less}} complex aggregation of different layer addressing each one to a specific characteristic and performance. Results of previous LCA researches, based on a cold climate scenario, have demonstrated the highest influence that some specific layers have on the overall impact of the green roofs and to what extent the global impact changes when insulation and the substrate layers vary in density and quality. Starting from results of these similar EU researches, this study aims to evaluate the variation of the overall impact in hot climates where insulation is less strategic than heat capacity. LCA has been applied to assess and compare the environmental impacts of four different green roof solutions compared to a standard clay pitched roof, based on the functional unit of 1 m 2 with the same reference service life, where layers have been selected according to local practice and market. Despite a general equivalence in environmental impacts of all the roofing elements, results have highlighted a general lack in specific life cycle inventory information that leads to a potential inaccuracy of the assessment especially when recycled material are used in the growing medium or when disposal scenario includes recycle processes...|$|E

Generally, a distinction is made between power- and trust-based buyer-seller relations (Cannon and Jr, 1999) and their relative impact on value appropriation by the focal firm (Lado, Boyd, and Hanlon, 1997). Surprisingly, very little has been said about the impact of market environment on the choice of the best buyer-supplier strategy in terms of value appropriation, even <b>if</b> <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> have shown the organizational advantages of vertical integration or long-term relations in a situation of high uncertainty (Heide and Miner, 1992; Sutcliffe and Zaheer, 1998).

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a warm-season grass native from North America, has been cultivated for decades as forage crop and only recently as bioenergy crop. Even <b>if</b> <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> reported a positive effect of nitrogen (N) supply on switchgrass yield and quality, potential indirect and direct environmental risks (e. g., eutrophication and greenhouse gas emission) are related to this practice.

Based on this, the aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of switchgrass to Mediterranean environment as forage crop and to improve biomass yield and its nutritional value by intercropping with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L). During spring 2013, in two switchgrass pure stands (varieties Alamo and Blackwell, respectively), alfalfa was established through direct seeding implementing a split-plot experimental design. Our first year results report a positive effect of the intercropping in increasing the total annual yield of the stand, of about 20 % with respect to the pure switchgrass stand. However, the presence of alfalfa negatively affected switchgrass yield in the mixture. In both varieties, the crude protein content was higher in the mixture than in the pure switchgrass stands. Conversely, the neutral detergent fibre content in the mixture was lower than in pure switchgrass.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{distributional}} implications of using full income instead of disposable income in the analysis of economic inequality. For that purpose the authors employ a very extensive list of noncash incomes with the aim of examining the distributional effects of noncash incomes and reassessing the level and structure of inequality under a comprehensive definition of income. Design/methodology/approach – The study employs the microdata of the 2004 / 2005 Greek Household Budget Survey. The value of non-monetary components was estimated using the appropriate statistical methods and econometric techniques. Tools of income distribution analysis were utilized for assessing the distributional consequences of adopting an extended definition of income. Findings – The results indicate that both private and public noncash incomes are far more equally distributed than monetary income, but the inequality-reducing effect of publicly-provided services is stronger. Noncash incomes appear to accrue more heavily to younger and older individuals. Research limitations/implications – The analysis uses the same equivalence scales for the analysis of both monetary income and full income. This treatment may be open to criticism in the case of in-kind public transfers. Due to data limitations the authors do not take into account home-produced services, as well as several in-kind transfers such as the provision of elderly care. Practical implications – The study argues in favor of moving beyond disposable income for measuring inequality and for the purposes of social policy design.

The timescale and {{mechanisms by which}} rivers evacuate the coarse fraction of small to gigantic landslidedeposits are poorly known, but are critical to predict post-seismic hydro-sedimentary hazards, interpret the signatureof earthquakes in sedimentary archives and decipher the coupling between erosion and tectonics. Here, weuse a new 2 D hydro-sedimentary evolution model to demonstrate that river self-organization into a narrower alluvialchannel overlying the bedrock valley dramatically increases sediment transport capacity of coarse sedimentsand reduces export time of gigantic landslides by orders of magnitude compared to existing theory. Predicted exporttimes obey a universal non-linear relationship function of landslide volume and pre-landslide valley transportcapacity. Dynamic alluvial channel narrowing is therefore a key, previously unrecognized, mechanism by whichmountain rivers rapidly digest extreme events and maintain their capacity to incise uplifted rocks. Upscaling theseresults to realistic populations of landslides show that removing half of the total sediment volume introduced bylarge earthquakes in the fluvial network would typically last 5 to 25 years in various tectonically active mountainbelts, with little impact of topography and climate. <b>If</b> <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> indicate a strong dependency of total landslidevolume to earthquake magnitude, our study show that the sediment export time of a landslide population isnot strongly impacted by earthquake magnitude or by the total volume of the landslide population.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{describe}} the circumcision procedure during history, its therapeutic and preventive goals, with focus on bioethical, economic and law issues. The origins of this practice are lost in antiquity. It was performed since 3000 BC by the Egyptians for hygienic and religious reasons. Moreover, male circumcision is a religious commandment in Judaism and Islam, and it is customary in some Oriental Orthodox and other Christian churches of Africa. Nowadays, circumcision is performed as a routine procedure by the Jews and the Muslims for religious reasons. The world prevalence of men with circumcision is 12. 5 - 33 %, especially in USA, Canada, Islamic people and Africa; in Europe the prevalence rate is low (in Great Britain it is 1. 5 %). Currently, male circumcision is being highly debated because of ethical, law and scientific issues and the different roles of this procedure: therapeutic, prophylactic (but there is no universal consensus) and ritualistic role. Nowadays, in Italy there is a strong debate about the consensus for this practice and its indications. The Italian law does not allow performing ritualistic circumcision, as a free of charge procedure in public hospitals, at the government's expenses, because the Italian law must protect different religious cultures, in name of the laity of the State. Thus, national bioethical committee (CNB) has established that ritualistic circumcision may only be performed on a paying basis in public hospitals. As a protective practice, circumcision has decreased in the entire world because of the improvement of hygienical conditions and, above all, the lack of unanimous consent on the real usefulness of protective circumcision, even <b>if</b> <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> have recently demonstrated the protecting role of male circumcision against HIV infection...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFlight agility, {{resistance}} to gusts, capability to hover {{coupled with a}} low noise generation might have been {{some of the reasons}} why insects are among the oldest species observed in nature. Biologists and aerodynamicists focused on analyzing such flight performances for diverse purposes: understanding the essence of flapping wings aerodynamics and applying this wing concept to the development of micro-air vehicles (MAVs). In order to put into evidence the fundamentally non-linear unsteady mechanisms responsible for the amount of lift generated by a flapping wing (Dickinson et al. in Science 284 : 1954 – 1960, 1999), experimental and numerical studies were carried out on typical insect model wings and kinematics. On the other hand, in the recent context of MAVs development, it is of particular interest to study simplified non- biological flapping configurations which could lead to lift and/or efficiency enhancement. In this paper, we propose a parametrical study of a NACA 0012 profile undergoing asymmetric hovering flapping motions at Reynolds 1000. On the contrary to normal hovering, which has been widely studied as being the most common configuration observed in the world of insects, asymmetric hovering is characterized by an inclined stroke plane. Besides the fact that the vertical force is hence a combination of both lift and drag (Wang in J Exp Biol 207 : 1137 – 1150, 2004), the specificity of such motions resides in the vortex dynamics which present distinct behaviours, whether the upstroke angle of attack leads to a partially attached or a strong separated flow, giving more or less importance to the wake capture phenomenon. A direct consequence of the previous remarks relies on the enhancement of aerodynamic efficiency with asymmetry. <b>If</b> <b>several</b> <b>studies</b> reported results based on the asymmetric flapping motion of dragonfly, only few works concentrated on parametrizing asymmetric motions (e. g. Wang in Phys Rev Lett 85 : 2216 – 2219, 2000).

40|$|Objectives Murine {{norovirus}} (MuNoV) {{belongs to}} the family Caliciviridae, genus Norovirus and is currently used as study model for human noroviruses, major aetiologic agents of gastroenteritis worldwide. Myxovirus (Mx) protein is an interferon-induced protein that host cell can oppose virus infection and was detected in several species including human being. In mice, two genes encoding Mx 1 and 2 proteins are present but it was evidenced that these genes were inactivated by deletions in several laboratory mouse strains. Mx antiviral activity was detected on several negative stranded RNA viruses but information are still lacking for most of positive stranded RNA viruses. In this study, the susceptibility of the MuNoV to specific and interspecific Mx proteins was investigated. Methods RAW 264. 7 cells (murine macrophages) were first tested for constitutive expression of Mx 1 proteins. Plasmids containing the murine Mx 1, bovine Mx 1 and human MxA genes under the CMV immediate early promotor were then used to transfect RAW 264. 7 cells for transient Mx expression. Negative control consisted in a plasmid expressing eGFP. Four hours after transfection, cells were infected at low MOI with the CW 1 MuNoV strain. Cells and supernatants were harvested 24 h post infection. RNA was extracted and viral genomic copies were measured by real time RT-PCR. Results An effect was confirmed on CW 1 replication for both specific and interspecific Mx proteins. The highest effect was obtained with the bovine Mx 1 protein. Conclusion In conclusion, we showed in these preliminary in vitro studies the MuNoV susceptibility to specific and interspecific Mx proteins. Bovine Mx 1 protein was already demonstrated to have important antiviral activity on negative stranded RNA viruses (influenza- and paramyxoviruses) and co-evolution with the host could explain a higher susceptibility to interspecific Mx proteins. Important implications of this adaptation could be expected on zoonotic concerns associated to NoV. Moreover, even <b>if</b> <b>several</b> control <b>studies</b> are still be conducted to validate these preliminary results, they could drive several pertaining questions on the MuNoV model used with laboratory mice. Perspectives of this work consist to validate the susceptibility in vivo and also to test the murine Mx 2 antiviral activity on MuNoV. Peer reviewe...|$|R
