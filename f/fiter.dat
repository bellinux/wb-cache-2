40|$|Following the {{development}} of the hemagglutination-inhibition technique for the measurement of antibodies directed against influenza virus, this in ~itro procedure largely supplanted in vivo neutralization techniques. It has been generally considered that the hemagglufination-inhibition and neutralization techniques measure the same antibody. Justification for this assumption appears to rest mainly on the demonstration by Hirst (1) of a fairly good correlation between serum antibody titers measured by hemagglutination-inhibition and titers measured by neutralization in mice. Some support for the concept also was provided by absorption experiments of Wiener, Henle, and Henle (2) which showed that both hemagghitination-inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies were absorbed from immune serum by concentrated influenza virus. Some evidence has been obtained, however, which suggests that the hemagglutination-inhibition and neutralization techniques may measure different antibodies.

In some tissues and body fluids, isatin does account for the MAO B-inhibitory component, e. g. in cerebrospinal fluid. Schiff bases and Mannich bases of isatin were reported to possess antibacterial [6 - 8], antifungal [9 - 11], antiviral [12 - 14], anti HIV [15 - 17], antiprotozoal [18, 19].

40|$|The {{most direct}} {{evidence}} for {{the participation of the}} renin-angiotensin pressor mechanism in experimental renal hypertension has been the lowering of blood pressure in these animals by antirenin (1 - 3). In human essential hypertension similar evidence is lacking, since antirenin produced in man by the administration of heterologous (hog) renin, while it can inactivate the renin of other animals, is ineffective against human renin (4). This observation probably explains the failure of the blood pressure to fall in hypertensive patients with high <b>fiters</b> of anfirenin to hog renin (5). Since angiotensin II, the active pressor octapeptide of the humoral mechanism of renal hypertension, does not exhibit this species specificity, attempts were made in this laboratory to produce antiangiotensin, by using an angiotensin II-protein complex as an antigen (6, 7). We were successful in producing antiangiotensin, but the titer of the antibody was tgo low and the antigen-antibody interaction was too slow to effect a lowering of the blood pressure of hypertensive dogs and rabbits, a During the present studies, we investigated the possibility that homologous renin might become antigenic as a result of appropriate chemical alteration of the renin molecule.

This paper {{reports the}} effects of changing hydraulic retention time (HRT, 1 - 3 days), pH (4 - 6) and temperature (T, 25 - 45 ℃) on the efficiencies of bacterial hydrolysis of suspended organic matter (SOM) {{and the rate of}} total volatile fatty acids (TVFAs) production treating food waste recycling (FWR) wastewater. In addition, the bacterial community responsible for this hydrolysis and biochemical methane potential test (BMP test) for quantifying the effect of hydrolysis optimization were examined. Maximum hydrolysis efficiency (i. e., 47. 5 % reduction of VSS) was predicted to occur at 3 days HRT, pH 6. 0 and T = 45 ℃ and maximum rate of TVFAs production (i. e., 18. 41 g/L production of TVFAs per day) was predicted to occur at 1 days HRT, pH 5. 2 and T = 38 ℃. Acidogenic bacterial community under this condition was investigated. Several band sequences were detected using denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE). Lactobacillus sp. seemed to contribute to glucose fermentation during the VSS reduction. These species appear to be important contributors to hydrolysis of suspended organic matter (SOM) in the wastewater. Other acidogenic anaerobes, Sporanaerobacter acetigenes, Eubacterium pyruviorans, and Pseudomonas fragi were also identified at the optimum VSS reduction point. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) test was evaluated to compare the effect of the hydrolysis optimization with the raw FWR wastewater. The experimental results showed that methane yields of raw FWR wastewater and effluent of the acidogenic reactor were 0. 635 and 0. 988 l CH 4 /g VSremoval, respectively. The biodegradability of the effluent of acidogenic reactor was superior to that of raw FWR wastewater. This result suggested that hydrolysis optimization in terms of VSS reduction could boost bioconversion process resulting in an accelerated process, increased organics availability, and enhanced biogas production...|$|R
40|$|Background The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) {{objectives}} for training in pediatrics include 26 procedural skills, 11 {{of which are}} included in the final in-training evaluation report (<b>FITER).</b> The importance of each procedure for practice and the preparedness of pediatric residency graduates to perform these procedures are not known. Methods A questionnaire was distributed to all pediatric residency program directors and members of the RCPSC Specialty Committee in Pediatrics (N = 21) in October 2010, requesting them to rate the perceived importance and preparedness of graduating pediatric residents in all procedural skills on a 5 point Likert scale, as well as the presence of a curriculum and documentation for each procedure. Mean importance and preparedness were calculated for each procedure. Results Response rate was 16 / 21 (76...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{methodology}} to identify finite-time Lagrangian structures from data and models using {{an extension of}} the Koopman operator-theoretic methods developed for velocity fields with simple (periodic, quasi-periodic) time-dependence. To achieve this, the notion of the Finite Time Ergodic (<b>FiTER)</b> partition is developed and rigorously justified. In combination with a clustering-based approach, the methodology enables identification of the temporal evolution of Lagrangian structures in a classic, benchmark, oceanographic transport problem, namely the cross-stream flux induced by the interaction of a meso- scale Gulf Stream Ring eddy with the main jet. We focus on a single mixing event driven by the interaction between an energetic cold core ring (a cyclone), the strong jet, and a number of smaller scale cyclones and anticyclones. The new methodology enab les reconstruction of Lagrangian structures in three dimensions and analysis of their time-evolution...|$|E
