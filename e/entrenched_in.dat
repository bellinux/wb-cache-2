5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1944, Ron Jeffery, an agent of British and Polish intelligence in occupied Poland, eluded the Abwehr and travelled to London with a report from Poland to the British government. His efforts were at first highly regarded, but subsequently ignored by the British, which a disillusioned Jeffery attributed to the treachery of Kim Philby and other high-ranking communist agents <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> the British system. Jeffery tried to inform the British government about the Katyn massacre, but was as a result released from the Army.|$|E

5|$|An Israeli {{reserve unit}} {{was called in}} from Tiberias. It arrived after twenty minutes and took {{positions}} around the town. At that point, Samakh (Tzemah) was defended by three platoons from the Barak battalion and reinforcements from neighboring villages.

Another myth, from Dartmoor, tells of a princess who wanted to marry an elven prince, but according to tradition had to bathe in pure cream first. Unfortunately, a witch who wanted the prince for her daughter kept souring the cream. Eventually, the prince offered the princess clotted cream, which the witch was unable to sour.|$|E
5|$|By 15th century, the Malacca Sultanate, whose hegemony {{reached over}} much of the western Malay archipelago, had become the centre of Islamization in the east. The Malaccan {{tradition}} was transmitted onwards and fostered a vigorous ethos of Malay identity. Since this era, the Islamic faith became closely identified with Malay society and {{played a significant role in}} defining the Malay identity. The close identification of the Malays with Islam continued until the 20th century and was finally <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> the Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia as well as in the national philosophy of Brunei known as the Malay Islamic Monarchy.|$|E

Just {{short of the}} Wyoming border, the bus {{was hit by a}} semi-tractor trailer that had crossed the median heading the opposite direction. The force of the collision tipped the bus onto its right side and steered it down a steep embankment. The bus slid for 150 feet and came to rest against a fence, about 35 feet below the eastbound lanes of I-80. 7 passengers were killed and more than 40 injured.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of September10, the central pressure of the storm decreased to 961mbar (28.38inHg) but sustained winds did not exceed 90mph (140km/h) according to the NHC. Luis maintained this intensity until it made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula in eastern Newfoundland early on September11. While tracking over Newfoundland, cold, dry air became <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> Luis's circulation and the system began to merge with the approaching trough. The NHC issued their final advisory on Hurricane Luis at 0900UTC on September11 as it tracked nearly 65mph (100km/h) to the northeast and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants persisted for 30more hours over the North Atlantic Ocean before being absorbed by the trough near the southern coast of Greenland late on September12.|$|E
5|$|General Manteuffel {{had been}} injured in {{the attack on the}} position. Wedel ordered a full cavalry assault through the woods and against the Russian right flank. When the {{superior}} Russian force countered, Prussian momentum faltered with the lack of a second column of timely reinforcement. Repeated assaults on the Russians <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> the heights resulted in massive losses for the Prussians. In the last of these assaults, Moritz Franz Kasimir von Wobersnow led eight battalions and six squadrons from Züllichau against the Russian right wing. At the same time his cavalry penetrated the enemy's infantry line, but the Russian cavalry, supported by gun-fire, drove them and the infantry back into the low ground.|$|E

5|$|In March 1978, Smith {{reached an}} accord with three African leaders, led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, who offered {{to leave the}} white {{population}} comfortably <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> exchange {{for the establishment of}} a biracial democracy. As a result of the Internal Settlement, elections were held in April 1979, concluding with the United African National Council (UANC) carrying a majority of parliamentary seats. On 1 June 1979, Muzorewa, the UANC head, became prime minister and the country's name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The Internal Settlement left control of the Rhodesian Security Forces, civil service, judiciary, and a third of parliament seats to whites. On 12 June, the United States Senate voted to lift economic pressure on the former Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for an attack}} on the Hindenburg Line at Bullecourt, the 1st Australian Brigade—of which the 1st Battalion was part—was attached to the 2nd Australian Division. The attack commenced in the morning of 3 May 1917, with the 2nd Division lined up in conjunction with thirteen other divisions. Despite some progress made early in the attack, the Australian forces were soon held up by strong opposition, and in the evening the 1st Battalion was <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> the old German line known as 'OG1'. Three of the battalion's companies occupied the line, while a fourth was placed in reserve. Their position was such that they occupied a wedge into the German line, while two flanks were in German held territory.|$|E
5|$|O'Leary served {{three years}} with the Irish Guards, leaving in August 1913 to join the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP) in Saskatchewan, Canada.

At {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in Europe during August 1914, O'Leary was given permission to leave the RNWMP and return to Britain in order to rejoin the army as an active reservist. On 22 October, O'Leary was mobilized and on 23 November he joined his regiment in France, then fighting with the British Expeditionary Force, <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> Flanders.|$|E

5|$|On 20 December, Canadian forces {{tried again}} and The Royal Canadian Regiment {{attacked}} Cider Crossroads at noon. This time, Vokes {{was determined that}} the operation would be successful, with armoured forces of the Three Rivers Regiment moving to the start lines well before 07:00. Due to shortages of fuel and poor weather, H-Hour was postponed until 14:15. When H-Hour came, a powerful creeping barrage supported two companies of the Royal Canadian Regiment eastward. By evening, B Company controlled the Cider Crossroads, having met virtually no resistance in their advance to the objective. However, German forces had already evacuated The Gully, falling back {{to prepare for a}} strong defence of Ortona, with elements of the powerful 1st Parachute Division firmly <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> the town.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore {{position}} may {{be compared}} with the situation in other jurisdictions. In Malaysia, the right to vote is <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> Article 119 of the Federal Constitution, but suffrage is similarly denied to those serving prison terms. In Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia (2009), it was held that while detainees under the Internal Security Act 1960– who have not been convicted of any crime– still enjoy the right to vote in national elections, that right may only be exercised only in the constituencies they are registered in, and does not extend to allowing them to vote while incarcerated elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|While Alvarado was {{consolidating}} {{his power}} in the Ulúa valley, Juan de Chávez's expedition in southern Higueras had met stiff resistance. They had marched up the Naco valley to the Peñol de Cerquín ("Rock of Cerquín"), which had been bypassed by Alvarado on his initial incursion. The Peñol de Cerquín was a formidable rocky butte that had been fortified by the natives. A great number of Indians had amassed at the fortress, which dominated the whole of southern Honduras. The natives were <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> the fortress, and determined to resist any Spanish attempt to pass. It is not known who led the indigenous resistance at this time, but it {{may well have been}} Lempira, a war leader who would later distinguish himself against the invading Spanish.|$|E
