40|$|Considering {{the need}} for more {{effective}} decision support in the context of distributed manufacturing, this paper develops an advanced analytics framework for configuring supply chain networks. The proposed framework utilizes a distributed multi-agent system architecture to deploy fuzzy rough sets-based algorithms for knowledge elicitation and representation. A set of historical sales data, including network node-related information, is used together with the relevant details of product families to predict supply chain configurations capable of fulfilling desired customer orders. Multiple agents such as data retrieval agent, knowledge acquisition agent, knowledge representation agent, configuration predictor agent, evaluator agent and <b>dispatching</b> <b>agent</b> are used to help execute a broad spectrum of supply chain configuration decisions. The proposed framework considers multiple product variants and sourcing options at each network node, as well as multiple performance objectives. It also captures decisions that span the entire supply chain simultaneously and, by implication, represents multiple network links. Using an industry test case, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of fulfilling customer orders with lower production and emissions costs, compared to the results generated using existing tools...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is devoted}} to development, creation and study of material flow control processes automation in logistic systems based on multi-agent approach. Throughout the dissertation, an analysis of existing methods and material flows control systems was conducted. Also existing methods and approaches to dynamics of material flows movement were analyzed, control efficiency criteria were identified: general system optimality criteria, and criteria based on intelligent agents goal functions. During {{the work on the}} dissertation, a material flow dynamics model was developed based on universal properties of material flows which exist on all hierarchical levels of logistic systems. As a base for the model, a supply chain model by Lisovskyi-Ponomarenko was taken giving a static representation of planned logistic system. Based on positive and negative factors of existing criteria, methods, control systems features and material flow movement models, a multi-agent model of material flow movement environment was created, a multi-level structure and function of the <b>dispatching</b> <b>agent</b> were presented. Analytical model of multi-agent environment was created, two groups of effectiveness criteria were presented. Based on presented criteria, a discrete-stochastic material flow movement presentation model was proposed along with material flows dispatch function based on discrete-stochastic dynamic programming and decision making Markov chains. The function for searching of quasi-optimal solution for material flow control tasks according to discrete-stochastic dynamic programming principles was developed. All decisions are made based on numeric assessments of the next system?s step efficiency. In order to check the efficiency of proposed control method, an imitational modeling of multi agent environment and proposed methods was conducted. The modeling itself was conducted based on software created specifically for this dissertation, and it implements algorithmic embodiment of developed models throughout the dissertation. As a result of modeling, conclusions on efficient returning of the system into the state of operational plans provisioning from states caused by extraordinary situations were made. ??????????? ????????? ??????????, ???????? ? ???????????? ?????????????????? ??????? ?????????? ????????????? ???????? ? ????????????? ???????? ?? ???? ??????????????? ???????. ? ?????? ??????????????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ???????????? ??????? ? ?????? ?????????? ????????????? ????????. ???????????????? ???????????? ?????? ? ??????? ? ????????????? ???????? ???????? ???????????? ???????, ?????????? ???????? ????????????? ???????? ??????????: ???????? ????????????? ????????????? ? ???????? ?? ???? ??????? ??????? ???????????????? ???????. ?????? ?? ??????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????, ???????, ?????? ?????????? ? ??????? ???????? ???????????? ???????, ??????? ????????????? ?????? ?????????????? ?????, ?????????? ??? ?????? ????????? ?????????? ????????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????????? ????????. ?? ???? ???????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????-?????????????? ?????? ????????????? ???????? ???????????? ???????, ? ? ?????????????? ?????????-??????????????? ????????????? ???????????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ???????, ????????????? ??????? ??????????????? ???????????? ???????. ??? ???????? ????????????? ?????? ????????????? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????? ?????????????? ????? ? ?????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????????? ???????. ? ?????????? ????????????? ???????? ??????????? ??????????? ??????? ? ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ????? ?????? ??? ????????????? ????????? ????????...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{computational}} study of an auction-based method for decentralized train scheduling. The method {{is well suited}} to the natural information and control structure of modern railroads. We assume separate network territories, with an autonomous <b>dispatch</b> <b>agent</b> responsible for the #ow of trains over each territory. Each train is represented by a self-interested agent that bids for the righttotravel across the network from its source to destination, submitting bids to multiple <b>dispatch</b> <b>agents</b> along its route as necessary. The bidding language allows trains to bid for the righttoenter and exit territories at particular times, and also to represent indi#erence over a range of times. Computational results on a simple network with straight-forward best-response bidding strategies demonstrate that the auction computes nearoptimal system-wide schedules. In addition, the method appears to have useful scaling properties, both {{with the number of}} trains and with the number of dispatchers, and generates less extremal solutions than those obtained using traditional centralized optimization techniques...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For mobile {{agents to}} be widely {{accepted}} in a distributed environment like the Internet, performance and security issues on their use {{have to be}} addressed. In this paper, we first present a parallel dispatch model with secure dispatch route structures. This model facilitates efficient <b>dispatching</b> of <b>agents</b> in a hierarchical manner, and ensures route security by exposing minimal route information to hosts. To further enhance route robustness, we also propose a mechanism with substitute routes that can bypass temporarily unreachable hosts, <b>dispatch</b> <b>agents</b> to substitute hosts before attempting the failed hosts again. Finally, a model for distributing the load of decrypting substitute routes is presented. We also present results of both analytical and empirical studies to evaluate different models. ...|$|R
