5|$|Castle is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} catch-all term {{for all kinds of}} fortifications and, as a result, has been misapplied in the technical sense. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> Maiden Castle which, despite the name, is an Iron Age hill fort which had a very different origin and purpose.|$|E
5|$|A central {{topic of}} Leontovych's work is choral music about {{everyday}} life. His music frequently reflect actual actions and events. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> his shchedrivka “Ой там за горою” (Oh there behind the mountain) {{in which a}} tenor initially starts the song with a solo {{and the rest of}} the voices of the choir gradually come in, reflecting carolling when new groups of singers join in. Then, a switching of parts begins between different groups of the choir, recreating the clamorous atmosphere of the New Year's Eve.|$|E
5|$|An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of {{the psychology}} of forms says that objects that move {{in the same direction}} are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E

5|$|As {{biologists}} define macroevolution, both microevolution and macroevolution {{have been}} observed. Speciations, for example, have been directly observed many times, despite popular misconceptions to the contrary. Additionally, the modern evolutionary synthesis draws no distinction in the processes {{described by the}} theory of evolution when considering macroevolution and microevolution as the former is simply at the species level or above and the latter is below the species level. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> ring species.|$|E
5|$|If a comet is {{traveling}} fast enough, it may leave the Solar System. Such comets follow the open {{path of a}} hyperbola, and as such they are called hyperbolic comets. To date, comets are only known to be ejected by interacting with another object in the Solar System, such as Jupiter. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> thought to be Comet C/1980 E1, which was shifted from a predicted orbit of 7.1 million years around the Sun, to a hyperbolic trajectory, after a 1980 close pass by the planet Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to protein- and solution-mediated processes, {{it is also}} possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling. A classic <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> phosphatidylserine-triggered phagocytosis. Normally, phosphatidylserine is asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane and is present only on the interior side. During programmed cell death a protein called a scramblase equilibrates this distribution, displaying phosphatidylserine on the extracellular bilayer face. The presence of phosphatidylserine then triggers phagocytosis to remove the dead or dying cell.|$|E

5|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that chromosomal copies of plasmid toxin-antitoxin systems may serve as anti-addiction modules– a method of omitting a plasmid from progeny without suffering {{the effects of the}} toxin. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an antitoxin on the Erwinia chrysanthemi genome that counteracts the toxic activity of an F plasmid toxin counterpart.|$|E
5|$|Like Profit making organisations, nonprofits {{and governments}} will produce Consolidated Financial Statements. These are {{generated}} {{in line with}} the reporting requirements in the country they are based or if they are large enough they may produce them under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), an <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the UK based charity Oxfam. If the organisation is small it may use a cash basis accounting but larger ones generally use accrual basis accounting for their funds.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} half-light radius {{includes}} {{stars in the}} outer part of the cluster that happen to lie {{along the line of}} sight, so theorists will also use the half-mass radius (r'm)—the radius from the core that contains half the total mass of the cluster. When the half-mass radius of a cluster is small relative to the overall size, it has a dense core. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> Messier 3 (M3), which has an overall visible dimension of about 18 arc minutes, but a half-mass radius of only 1.12 arc minutes.|$|E
2500|$|There can be subtle {{differences}} in positions {{that make the}} difference between a win and a draw. Two <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> shown in the diagrams [...]|$|R
50|$|<b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> {{the gate}} to the huge {{recreational}} area in the city: The Gorkij Park, the memorial for Maksim Gorkij and the sports arena Spartak.|$|R

5|$|Quantities {{of atoms}} {{are found in}} {{different}} states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as temperature and pressure. By varying the conditions, materials can transition between solids, liquids, gases and plasmas. Within a state, a material can also exist in different allotropes. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> solid carbon, which can exist as graphite or diamond. Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as dioxygen and ozone.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, it {{is argued}} that {{evolutionary}} theory is circular reasoning, in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution is required to interpret the evidence. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the claim that geological strata are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in. However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their position relative to other strata and by radiometric dating, and most strata were dated before the theory of evolution was formulated.|$|E
5|$|When {{an object}} is in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium, a global layer of liquid covering its surface would form a liquid {{surface of the}} same shape as the body, apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures. If the body does not rotate, {{it will be a}} sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more oblate or even scalene it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a non-spherical body in hydrostatic equilibrium is , which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces come into effect as well, distorting it into a prolate spheroid. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System due to effects of tidal heating. Tidal forces also cause a body's rotation to gradually become tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the Pluto–Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Earth's Moon is also tidally locked, as are many satellites of the gas giants.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{butterflies}} and moths migrate to escape from potentially harmful circumstances. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> a shortage <b>of</b> proper food plants, an unfavorable climate, like cold or extreme rain or overpopulation.|$|R

5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and {{is reported to be}} nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E
5|$|Although castle {{construction}} faded {{towards the}} end of the 16thcentury, castles did not necessarily all fall out of use. Some retained a role in local administration and became law courts, while others are still handed down in aristocratic families as hereditary seats. A particularly famous <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> Windsor Castle in England which was founded in the 11thcentury and is home to the monarch of the United Kingdom. In other cases they still had a role in defence. Tower houses, which are closely related to castles and include pele towers, were defended towers that were permanent residences built in the 14th to 17th centuries. Especially common in Ireland and Scotland, they could be up to five storeys high and succeeded common enclosure castles and were built by a greater social range of people. While unlikely to provide as much protection as a more complex castle, they offered security against raiders and other small threats.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1960s and 1970s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of hadrosaurids like Edmontosaurus {{was that they}} were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> William Morris's 1970 interpretation of an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet much like that of some modern ducks, filtering plants and aquatic invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans from the water and discharging water via V-shaped furrows along the inner face of the upper beak. This interpretation of the beak has been rejected, as the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds.|$|E
50|$|Cooperative {{behavior}} {{may also be}} enforced, where their failure to cooperate results in negative consequences. One <b>of</b> the best <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> worker policing, which occurs in social insect colonies.|$|R
50|$|A sign or {{hoarding}} {{with letters}} missing. The first <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a shop sign which contained the words Uyama, {{but the rest}} of the lettering was missing, hence the name.|$|R
50|$|Folding a paper {{more than}} once in the same {{direction}} (i.e. with parallel creases) is called parallel folding. Common <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> the half fold, letter fold, gate fold, and Z-fold.|$|R
5|$|Different {{combinations}} of players, gongs and mallets {{can be used}} for playing the agung: two players with each assigned their own gong or just one. When playing alone, the agung player could either play both gongs with the player holding the higher-pitched gongs face-to-face, with the lower one held at an angle by an assistant for stability, or just one gong. The latter style, common among downriver Maguindanaos in Simuay, who consider this style an old one, uses only the higher-pitch gong for it, unlike the lower-pitched gong, is considered the lead gong, therefore having primary importance. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> when single gong agungs are used during a tagunggo piece.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{also occur}} {{naturally}} and {{are involved in}} the regulation of metabolism. For example, enzymes in a metabolic pathway can be inhibited by downstream products. This type of negative feedback slows the production line when products begin to build up and is an important way to maintain homeostasis in a cell. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors are proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This can help control enzymes that may be damaging to a cell, like proteases or nucleases. A well-characterised <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the ribonuclease inhibitor, which binds to ribonucleases in one of the tightest known protein–protein interactions. Natural enzyme inhibitors can also be poisons and are used as defences against predators or as ways of killing prey.|$|E
5|$|One {{argument}} {{in favour of}} the toxin acting as a defence against predators is the apparent Müllerian mimicry {{in some of the}} various unrelated pitohui species, which all have similar plumage. The species known as pitohuis were long thought congeneric, due to their similarities in plumage, but are now spread through three families, the oriole, whistlers and Australo-Papuan bellbirds. The similarity in appearance therefore presumably evolved as a shared aposematic signal to common predators of their distasteful nature. This signal is reinforced by the species' strong sour odor. There is also evidence that some other birds in New Guinea have evolved Batesian mimicry, where a non-toxic species adopts the appearance of a toxic species. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the non-toxic juvenile greater melampitta, which has plumage similar to the hooded pitohui.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, some {{emperors}} had two gō titles, when reoccupying {{the throne}} {{in a process}} called chōso (:ja:重祚). One <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Empress Kōgyoku, who later mounted the throne as Empress Saimei.|$|R
3000|$|One of {{our main}} {{conclusions}} is that advanced use of disaggregated data provides more options than programmes created for analysing e.g. European-wide accident data. Two specific <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> as follows: [...]...|$|R
25|$|In musicals, {{an exclamation}} mark is usually used when {{the title of}} the show has the same title of a song within the act. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> shows like Oklahoma! and Mamma Mia!.|$|R
