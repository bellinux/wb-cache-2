5|$|Following the takeover, Manchester United {{continued}} to thrive, with the 2005–06 season seeing Old Trafford's capacity being expanded and a lucrative new shirt sponsorship deal signed in April 2006 with American company AIG (which {{had a large}} stake in a hedge <b>fund</b> <b>company</b> that helped to fund Glazer's takeover of the club). Increased revenue from TV rights to each competition the club participates in, {{as well as its}} various sponsorship deals, also boosted the club's profitability. This came despite fears among many supporters that the debt incurred in buying the club could lead to insolvency.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine and analyze past {{development}} of mutual funds in large and small mutual <b>fund</b> <b>companies</b> and see if there are any differences between these two segments. Limitations on the number of funds have been made by choosing Nordic mutual <b>fund</b> <b>companies</b> that invest in emerging markets over an 11 -year period. The study is made on 66 mutual funds managed by 13 mutual <b>fund</b> <b>companies</b> in which the segment of small <b>fund</b> <b>companies</b> includes seven <b>fund</b> <b>companies</b> with assets under management less than 100 billion SEK and the segment of large mutual <b>fund</b> <b>companies</b> includes six <b>fund</b> <b>companies</b> with assets under management more than 400 billion SEK. In the comparison of the segments the Sharpe ratio has been used to calculate the risk-adjusted return. The study shows small differences of the risk-adjusted return between the segments. Results for the mutual <b>fund</b> <b>companies</b> in the minor segment indicate a more unequal risk-adjusted return compared to the major <b>fund</b> <b>companies.</b> Furthermore the results show that small <b>fund</b> <b>companies</b> alone can generate a higher return but that the larger fund companies' funds are a more stable investment in the longer run...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{extended}} version of our earlier study (Abd. Majid and Maulana 2010) to further re-examine the relative efficiencies of selected Islamic and conventional mutual <b>funds</b> <b>companies</b> in Indonesia {{during the period}} 2004 to 2007 and their determinants. To measure their efficiencies, the output-input data consisting of a panel of conventional and Islamic mutual <b>funds</b> <b>companies</b> are empirically examined based on {{the most commonly used}} non-parametric approach, namely, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). It also attempts to investigate the influence of the mutual funds companies’ characteristics on efficiency measures using the Generalized Least Square (GLS) estimation. The study finds that, on average, the Indonesian mutual <b>funds</b> <b>companies</b> experienced a decrease in Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth. It is mainly caused by a decline in both efficiency and technical efficiencies, where the efficiency change is largely contributed by the changes in pure efficiency rather than scale efficiency. Additionally, the study also documents that the funds size negatively affects efficiency. This indicates that due to its diseconomies of scale, a larger mutual <b>funds</b> <b>company</b> is less efficient than a smaller <b>funds</b> <b>company.</b> Finally, in comparing the efficiency of the mutual <b>funds</b> <b>companies,</b> the study finds that, on average, the Islamic unit trust companies perform more poorly than their conventional counterparts...|$|R

25|$|Because ETFs {{trade on}} an exchange, each {{transaction}} is generally {{subject to a}} brokerage commission. Commissions depend on the brokerage and which plan is chosen by the customer. For example, a typical flat fee schedule from an online brokerage firm in the United States ranges from $10 to $20, {{but it can be}} as low as $0 with discount brokers. Due to this commission cost, the amount invested has a great bearing; someone who wishes to invest $100 per month may have a significant percentage of their investment destroyed immediately, while for someone making a $200,000 investment, the commission cost may be negligible. Generally, mutual funds obtained directly from the <b>fund</b> <b>company</b> itself do not charge a brokerage fee. Thus, when low or no-cost transactions are available, ETFs become very competitive.|$|E

A year later, the mutual <b>fund</b> <b>company</b> Powershares Capital Management launched the WilderHill Clean Energy Portfolio exchange-traded fund (AMEX: PBW), which mirrors {{the performance of}} the ECO index. As of August 2008, PBW held about $1.4 billion in net assets. Wilder describes the philosophy behind quantifying funds by environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues: [...] "This generation tends to be financially sophisticated as seen in the growth of low-cost, no-load funds. They now seek fund holdings that better reflect positives such as clean energy, organic foods and healthier living along with low expenses, transparency, less correlation to major indexes and better tax efficiency. And they shouldn't have to give up any performance in the aim of achieving good returns with social responsibility to boot." ...|$|E

Career concerns of both agents lead to a churning equilibrium in which uninformed managers trade noisily, and uninformed <b>fund</b> <b>companies</b> are willing to hire these uninformed managers. This equilibrium delivers non-fully informative prices and a positive and high trading volume.
