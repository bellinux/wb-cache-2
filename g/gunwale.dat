5|$|A {{cannonball}} {{from the}} second French broadside struck Corbet within minutes of the first broadside, the ball tearing off his foot above the ankle just as a large wooden splinter thrown from the <b>gunwale</b> struck the thigh of the same leg, shattering the bone. Corbet was brought below to the ship's surgeon where the remnant of his leg was hastily amputated and bound, and command devolved on Lieutenant John Crew Tullidge. At 02:30, Astrée pulled away from Africaine to perform hasty repairs, but Bouvet's guns had wrecked Africaines rigging, leaving the British frigate uncontrollable and largely immobile. Slowly moving ahead, Africaine engaged Iphigénie at close range but was counter attacked by Astrée and found herself assailed on both sides, Astrée angled in such a position {{that she was able}} to rake the British ship, inflicting significant damage and casualties.|$|E
25|$|Handliners – are {{normally}} undecked vessels used for handlining (fishing {{with a line}} and hook). Handliners include canoes and other small or medium-sized vessels. Traditional handliners are less than 12 metres o/a, {{and do not have}} special gear handling, there is no winch or gurdy. Locating fish is left to the fishermen's personal knowledge of fishing grounds rather than the use of special electronic equipment. Non traditional handliners can set and haul using electrical or hydraulic powered reels. These mechanised reels {{are normally}} fastened to the <b>gunwale</b> or set on stanchions close to or overhanging the <b>gunwale.</b> They operate all over the world, some in shallow waters, some fishing up to 300 metres deep. No typical deck arrangement exists for handliners.|$|E
25|$|Halyards (sometimes haulyards), {{are used}} to raise sails and control luff tension. In large yachts the halyard returns to the deck but in small racing {{dinghies}} {{the head of the}} sail is attached by a short line {{to the head of the}} mast while the boat is lying on its <b>gunwale.</b>|$|E
50|$|The wood of Bobea is hard, wearable, and yellow. It {{was used}} for the <b>gunwales</b> of Polynesian voyaging canoes. The <b>gunwales</b> of modern canoes are {{sometimes}} painted yellow in imitation of the wood that is no longer widely available.|$|R

25|$|On 2 December 1840, a heavy gale drove Zebra ashore off Mount Carmel near Haifa and wrecked her. During the evening, three crewmen {{jumped into}} a gig {{in an attempt}} to escape, but drowned when it capsized. In the morning a foreyard was placed over the <b>gunwale</b> that {{permitted}} {{the rest of the crew}} to reach shore safely.|$|E
25|$|Beden – The prime ancient Somali {{maritime}} {{vessel that}} today remains the longest surviving sewn ship in East Africa and the world. The ship's construction style {{is unique to}} Somalia and significantly differs from extinct sewn ships of Arabia, South India and adjacent islands. An average Beden ship measures 10m or more and is strengthened with a substantial <b>gunwale,</b> attached by trenails. The Somali fishermen also use stone anchors to prevent their ships from being drawn to the shore when fishing.|$|E
25|$|Trapeze wires, {{which are}} narrow gauge {{flexible}} stainless steel wire, running from about the cross {{trees on the}} mast to the harness worn by a crew member and sometimes skipper on a high speed racing skiff. The lower section often has a system of small blocks which are used by the crew to alter {{the length of the}} trapeze wire as the crew moves aft on a broad reach. When the boat changes tack the crew unclips the hook, the wire is automatically sprung into the <b>gunwale</b> by an elastic tail.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of her capture Vengeance was armed with twenty-eight 18-pounders on her main deck, sixteen 12-pounders and eight 42-pounder carronades on her {{quarterdeck}} and forecastle, brass swivel guns on the <b>gunwale,</b> and shifting guns on the main and quarter decks. All these measures were in French pounds. In English measures the broadsides in this case were 498 pounds for Seine and 434 for Vengeance. Crew sizes were 281 men and 326 men, respectively. Troude attributes to Vengeance an armament of 26 18-pounders, 10 8-pounders and 4 36-pounder caronades, totalling a broadside of 346 pounds.|$|E
25|$|Murdoch and Moody {{oversaw the}} {{lowering}} of Boat 15 concurrently with Boat 13 and {{it reached the}} water only a minute later, at 1:41a.m. Fireman Frank Dymond {{was put in charge}} of what was the most heavily loaded boat at launching, with about 65 people aboard. It was so heavily loaded that the gunwales were reported to be far down in the water; one female passenger later said that when she leaned against the <b>gunwale</b> her hair trailed in the water. The boat {{was one of the last}} to be recovered by Carpathia, at about 7:30a.m.|$|E
25|$|The keels were wooden boats with {{a pointed}} stern, {{so that the}} bow and stern looked almost the same. They were of shallow draught so that when fully loaded they drew only {{four and a half}} feet. The keels were forty feet long and at least 19 feet wide amidships: a very broad configuration. In 1266 the {{standard}} load of a keel was set at 20 chaldrons (wagonloads) or approximately 17 tons. After 1497 the keel load was frequently increased, until in 1635 it was set at 21.1 tons. A chaldron was a horse-drawn wagon containing 17 cwt of coal. Keels were supposed to be measured by the Kings Commissioners and given a load mark to show when they were full. The keels had a single mast with a square sail attached to a yardarm and two large oars. They had no rudder and so a large sweep was used for steering when the keel was under sail. The oars were used to row when the wind was not favourable. There were also two iron-shod poles for polling the keel through any shallows. The floor of the hold was only two feet below the <b>gunwale</b> to allow for easy loading. The coal was piled high above the top of the hold with wooden boards used to prevent the cargo from sliding. Each keel was manned by a skipper, two crewmen and a boy, known as a ‘pee dee’. The meaning of this title is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Native Hawaiians {{used the}} soft, greenish wood of aiea to make pale (<b>gunwales)</b> for waa (outrigger canoes) and aho (thatching sticks).The reddish yellow berries were {{sometimes}} eaten, while the bark and leaves {{were used for}} (unspecified) medicinal purposes.|$|R

60|$|And now, {{while both}} elastic <b>gunwales</b> were {{springing}} in and out, as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; {{and from his}} body being submerged beneath the boat, {{he could not be}} darted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the frail <b>gunwales</b> bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the <b>gunwales,</b> and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across.|$|R
25|$|The crane's {{innovation}} {{was in the}} use of {{a curved}} jib, made of riveted wrought iron platework to form a square-section box girder. This curved jib could reach further into the hold of a ship, clear of the deep <b>gunwales</b> alongside the quay.|$|R
50|$|The PBR was {{manufactured}} in two versions, the first with 31 foot length and 10 foot, 7 inch beam. The Mark II version 32 ft long and one foot wider beam had improved drives to reduce fouling and aluminum <b>gunwales</b> to resist wear.|$|R

2500|$|The Norse god who {{was most}} popular was Thor, and the Altuna Runestone in Uppland shows Thor's fishing {{expedition}} {{when he tried}} to capture the Midgard Serpent. Two centuries later, the Icelander Snorri Sturluson would write: [...] "The Midgarth Serpent bit at the ox-head and the hook caught in the roof of its mouth. When it felt that, it started so violently that both Thor's fists went smack against the <b>gunwale.</b> Then Thor got angry, assumed all his godly strength, and dug his heels so sturdily that his feet went right through the bottom of the boat and he braced them on the sea bed." [...] (Jansson's translation). The Altuna Runestone has also included the foot that went through the planks.|$|E
50|$|South Mayo currachs {{differ from}} most other currach types in that, {{instead of the}} {{stringers}} which elsewhere run outside the latticework frame, the bottom and sides are covered with a thin planking. In Achill Island the currach is built with double <b>gunwales.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Keelmen loaded coal {{into the}} keel's hold from a [...] "spout" [...] or {{riverside}} chute. The keel {{would then be}} taken down river on the ebb tide using oars, or sail if the wind was favourable, and taken alongside the waiting collier where the crew would shovel the coal into the collier, working even after darkness. This could be arduous due to the difference in height between the keel’s <b>gunwale</b> and the collier’s deck. When keelmen struck in 1819 one of their demands was an extra shilling per keel per foot that {{the side of the}} collier exceeded five feet. After a time colliers were constructed in such a manner as {{to make it easier to}} load coal into them. After loading the keelmen would return for another load if there was daytime left and tides allowed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} be able to {{navigate}} Stewart River, BYN Co. construction foreman A.E. Henderson specifically designed SS Keno for shallow water operation. As built, she was [...] long, with a beam of [...] For comparison, the second SS Klondike, completed eight years after the Keno for service on the main river routes, was over 200ft long and had a beam in excess of 40ft. Most importantly, in service the Keno draught was typically only between two and three feet (0.6 to 0.9m), and with a light load as little as [...] Her hull was constructed from wood, carvel-built, and her superstructure was arranged in a three deck configuration typical of sternwheelers. The lowermost deck, the main deck at <b>gunwale</b> level, was the freight house. Above this, and approximately the same size, was the saloon deck, carrying much of the vessel's passenger accommodation and facilities. Uppermost was the smaller, punningly titled 'Texas' deck, carrying larger staterooms for the captain, senior crew and first class passengers. Surmounting the Texas was the pilothouse, from which the vessel was commanded. In this configuration, the Keno gross tonnage was 553.17tons.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the matches}} against Carlton, the Waratahs adopted Australian rules, {{and for a}} time, the colonial game {{threatened}} to supersede rugby in Sydney. Coulthard accepted an invitation from Phil Sheridan, a trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground, to travel to Sydney {{with the aim of}} fostering Australian rules in the city. On 15 September 1877, soon after his arrival, Coulthard joined several local footballers on a fishing trip in Sydney Harbour. The group was anchored near Shark Island when Coulthard, sitting on the boat's <b>gunwale</b> {{with the back of his}} tailcoat hanging over the side, was pulled overboard by [...] "a monster shark, 13 feet long". The shark had seized his coattails trailing on the water and dragged him beneath the surface [...] "some ten or twelve feet" [...] until it tore the coat from his body. After kicking at the shark, Coulthard swam to the surface alongside the boat, [...] "into which he threw, with the aid of his friends, a kind of somersault, just about as quickly as he had been taken overboard." [...] The incident was said to be [...] "one of the most marvellous escapes from a fearful death on record" [...] and [...] "probably without parallel in Australian waters".|$|E
