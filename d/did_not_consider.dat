5|$|From May 1684, the King's illegitimate son, James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, {{lived in}} the Netherlands, where he was fêted by William and Mary.

Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966. He avoided the hi-hat, and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and cymbals.|$|E
5|$|Opinion has varied on the {{validity}} of a separate genus for Nedoceratops. John Scannella and Jack Horner regarded it as an intermediate growth stage between Triceratops and Torosaurus. Andrew Farke, in his 2011 redescription of the only known skull, concluded {{that it was an}} aged individual of its own valid taxon, Nedoceratops hatcheri. Nicholas Longrich and Daniel Fields also <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>consider</b> it a transition between Torosaurus and Triceratops, suggesting that the frill holes were pathological.|$|E
5|$|Phellodon was {{circumscribed}} in 1881 by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten to contain white-toothed fungi. Karsten included three species: P.cyathiformis, P.melaleucus, and the type, P.niger (originally published with the epithet nigrum). P.nigrum was originally described by Elias Fries in 1815 {{as a species}} of Hydnum. Some early authors <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>consider</b> Phellodon distinct {{enough to be a}} separate genus, and folded species assigned to this genus into Hydnellum.|$|E

Associate Justice Antonin Scalia responded by saying that, according to Thompson v. Keohane, custody is an objective test and subjective factors like characteristics of the individual do not matter.|$|E
