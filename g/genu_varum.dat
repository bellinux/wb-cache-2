25|$|An {{osteotomy}} is {{a surgical}} operation whereby a bone is cut to shorten or lengthen it or {{to change its}} alignment. It is sometimes performed to correct a hallux valgus, or to straighten a bone that has healed crookedly following a fracture. It {{is also used to}} correct a coxa vara, genu valgum, and <b>genu</b> <b>varum.</b> The operation is done under a general anaesthetic.|$|E
25|$|The {{angle of}} {{inclination}} formed between the neck and shaft of the femur, (collodiaphysial angle), varies with age—about 150° in the newborn, it gradually decreases to 126-128° in adults, to reach 120° in old age. Pathological changes in this angle results in abnormal posture of the leg: A small angle produces coxa vara and a large angle in coxa valga; the latter is usually combined with <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> and coxa vara leads genu valgum. Additionally, a line drawn through the femoral neck superimposed on a line drawn through the femoral condyles forms an angle, the torsion angle, which {{makes it possible for}} flexion movements of the hip joint to be transposed into rotary movements of the femoral head. Abnormally increased torsion angles results in a limb turned inward and a decreased angle in a limb turned outward; both cases resulting in a reduced range of a persons mobility.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{complication}} of loss of dorsiflexion power and loss of sensation on the dorsum of the foot as a consequence of osteotomy in the proximal part of the tibia. Most recent articles on tibial osteotomy for <b>genu</b> valgum or <b>varum</b> deal with adult patients, the procedure being done principally for degener-ative arthritis of the knee 2, 3, 4, 5 The complications which have been reported in adults are few. The single specifically vascular complication reported is laceration of the anterior tibial artery and this did not cause any ischemic problem postoperative-ly 2 The literature concerning a complication of this type of osteotomy in children also is scant 1, 6, and none has suggested that the etiology of the conuplication was either compression or traction on the vessels. It should be recognized that osteotomy of the proximal part of the tibia in the child is potentially more liable to this complication than the same procedure in the adult. This statement is based on the anatomical facts that in the child the osteotomy must be done more distally in the metaphysis to avoid damaging the proximal tibial epiphysis. The placement of the osteotomy and the subsequent correction at tha...|$|R
25|$|Usually, {{the large}} joints {{of the lower}} limb are aligned in a {{straight}} line, which represents the mechanical longitudinal axis of the leg, the Mikulicz line. This line stretches from the hip joint (or more precisely {{the head of the}} femur), through the knee joint (the intercondylar eminence of the tibia), and down {{to the center of the}} ankle (the ankle mortise, the fork-like grip between the medial and lateral malleoli). In the tibial shaft, the mechanical and anatomical axes coincide, but in the femoral shaft they diverge 6°, resulting in the femorotibial angle of 174° in a leg with normal axial alignment. A leg is considered straight when, with the feet brought together, both the medial malleoli of the ankle and the medial condyles of the knee are touching. Divergence from the normal femorotibial angle is called <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> if the center of the knee joint is lateral to the mechanical axis (intermalleolar distance exceeds 3cm), and genu valgum if it is medial to the mechanical axis (intercondylar distance exceeds 5cm). These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh's adductors and abductors.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{relationship}} between sport participation and body adaptations during growth.

40|$|Objective: <b>Genu</b> <b>varum</b> is {{considered}} {{a risk factor for}} knee osteoarthritis. Being aware of the changes in muscles activity in various standing positions among <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> patients, can provide insight for preventing osteoarthritis in this population. This study is undertaken to compare muscles activity in various standing positions between young healthy and <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> male individuals. Methods: 80 healthy male university students, 40 normal and 40 subjects with <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> deformity, participated in this study. Deformity of <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> was assessed with caliper and Goniometer. Each subject stood in five different positions and muscles activity was recorded with EMG device. For data analysis, Matlab and SPSS software were employed and Mixed variance analysis test (Mixed ANOVA) was run to compare the dependent variables at a significance level of P ≤ 0. 05. Results: Significant differences were observed between the two groups for muscles activity of the tensor fasia latae (at single leg with closed eye position), tertius fibulae and gluteus medius muscles (at single leg with closed eye and upward head postions) (p≤ 0. 05) while no significant differences were observed in other muscles. Conclusion: According to the obtained results, it can be suggested that frontal knee angle may affect muscles activity. Perhaps {{one of the reasons for}} higher injury risk and knee osteoarthritis in <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> population is the increase in muscles activity. Therefor, It is proposed that focusing on corrective exercises can reduce these risks...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Genu</b> <b>varum</b> is a {{physical}} deformity marked by bowing of the leg. One of the risk factors of this musculoskeletal alignment is stress on the knee joint such as with exercise. Objectives: Since the evaluation of <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> has not been widely studies, {{this study was conducted}} to examine the association between <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> and playing soccer. Materials and Methods: Between Septembers 2010 - 2012, 750 soccer players and 750 non-soccer players 10 - 18 years of age were included in the study. A questionnaire of data including age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), years of soccer participation, the average time of playing soccer per week, previous trauma to the lower limbs, history of any fractures of the knee, previous hospitalizations, and the distance of joint lines between the knees was assessed for all subjects. Chi-square, student t-test, and one-way ANOVA were used for statistical analysis by SPSS v. 19. 0 software. In all tests, a P value of less than 0. 05 was construed as statistically significant. Results: Both soccer players and controls had <b>genu</b> <b>varum.</b> However, the incidence of <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> was higher in the soccer players (P = 0. 0001) and it was more prevalent in the 16 - 18 year age group (P = 0. 0001).

40|$|Introduction: Any {{disturbance}} in balance control procedures {{may increase the}} risk of injury during sportactivities. Knee deformities such as genu valgum and <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> may perturb the line of gravity passingthe lower limb joints and so disturb dynamic and static balance indices. This study was designed toinvestigate the effects of genu valgum and <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> deformity on the static and dynamic balance indices. Material and Methods: A total of 90 non-athletic female university students were assigned in one of thethree experimental groups; normal knee (n= 30), <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> (n= 30) and genu valgum (n= 30), according totheir knee conditions. Static and dynamic overall stability index (OSI), anterior-posterior stability index(APSI), medial-lateral stability index (MLSI) and falling risk were evaluated three times by Biodex balancesystem, and the average of each index were recorded. Results: No significant difference was seen between groups in term of dynamic and static OSI and APSI,while significant lower stability was found in the <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> group compared to normal groups in term ofdynamic and static MLSI (p< 0. 05). A significant increased in falling risk was also seen in genu varumgroup, compared to the normal group (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The results showed that mechanical disturbance due to the <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> deformity mayperturb the medial-lateral balance indices in both static and dynamic situations.

40|$|Extensometric {{recording}} of cortical deformations enabled {{comparison of the}} mechanical responses of the diaphyses of tibia and fibula to centered and decentered stresses such as occur in <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> and genu valgum. The tibiofibular frame, normally subjected to sagittal flexion, flexes in different ways in these pathological conditions: in <b>genu</b> <b>varum,</b> inward and backward and in genu valgum, outward and foreward where the tibia is concerned; the inverse applies to the fibula. Owing to the abnormal stresses to which the knee is exposed, the diaphyseal tensions, abnormal both as regards intensity and as regards distribution, bring about the cortical adaptations which radiology will reveal.

The purpose of this study is to compare the muscle activity in the different knee alignment during leg press exercise. 【Methods】Four normal knee and Five <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> performed the leg press using three stance of narrow, medium and wide stance with the load of 75 %/ 1 RM. Surface EMG date were collected (l 000 Hz) from vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), adductor longus (AL), biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius (GAS), soleus (SOL). Integrated EMG (iEMG) values were calculated for each muscle during each rep. A video camera recorded the performing form during leg press from the frontal plane. 【Results and Discussion】As the leg press was to strengthen of the thigh muscle, VM, VL and RF of both groups worked strongly. However SOL of <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> worked as strong as the level of activity of the thigh, iEMG of the SOL showed low value significantly by using wide stance. When the <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> group performed maximal knee flexion using the narrow, their ankle was valgus on the video screen.

Methods: From March 2007 to August 2007, 33 patients (37 cases) with osteoarthritis of the knee and a <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> deformity underwent a high tibial osteotomy with using an Aescula open wedge plate and an allogenic bone graft. The patients were followed up for more than 1 year. Before and after surgery, the correction angle of the <b>genu</b> <b>varum</b> was measured by the lower extremity scannogram and the posterior tibial slope, the joint space distance and the time to bone union were evaluated. The functional factors were evaluated using the Knee Society Score.
