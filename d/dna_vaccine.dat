25|$|No DNA {{vaccines}} {{have been}} approved for human use in the United States. Few experimental trials have evoked a response strong enough to protect against disease and the technique's usefulness remains to be proven in humans. A veterinary <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccine</b> to protect horses from West Nile virus has been approved.|$|E
25|$|Another {{consideration}} {{is the choice}} of promoter. The SV40 promoter was conventionally used until research showed that vectors driven by the Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) promoter had much higher expression rates. More recently, expression rates have been further increased {{by the use of}} the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter. Inclusion of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPV)-CTE with/without rev increased envelope expression. Furthermore, the CTE+rev construct was significantly more immunogenic than CTE-alone vector. Additional modifications to improve expression rates include the insertion of enhancer sequences, synthetic introns, adenovirus tripartite leader (TPL) sequences and modifications to the polyadenylation and transcriptional termination sequences. An example of <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccine</b> plasmid is pVAC, which uses SV40 promoter.|$|E
40|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{are based}} on the {{transfer}} of genetic material, encoding an antigen, to the cells of the vaccine recipient. Despite high expectations of <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> as a result of promising preclinical data their clinical utility remains unproven. However, much data is gathered in preclinical and clinical studies about the safety of <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Here we review current knowledge about the safety of <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Safety concerns of <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> relate to genetic, immunologic, toxic, and environmental effects. In this review we provide an overview of findings related to the safety of <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines,</b> obtained so far. We conclude that the potential risks of <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> are minimal.

25|$|Therapeutic <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccine</b> VGX-3100, which {{consists}} of plasmids pGX3001 and pGX3002, has been granted a waiver by the European Medicines Agency for pediatric treatment of squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix caused by HPV types 16 and 18. According to an article published 16 Sep 2015 in The Lancet, which reviewed the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of VGX-3100 in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (phase 2b) targeting HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6 and E7 proteins for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3, {{it is the first}} therapeutic vaccine to show efficacy against CIN 2/3 associated with HPV-16 and HPV-18. In June, 2017, VGX-3100 entered a phase 3 clinical trial called REVEAL-1 for the treatment of HPV-induced high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. The estimated completion time for collecting primary clinical endpoint data is August, 2019.|$|E
25|$|Prime-boost {{strategies}} {{have been successful}} in inducing protection against malarial challenge in a number of studies. Primed mice with plasmid DNA encoding Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite surface protein (PyCSP), then boosted with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the same protein had significantly higher levels of antibody, CTL activity and IFN-γ, and hence higher levels of protection, than mice immunized and boosted with plasmid DNA alone. This can be further enhanced by priming with a mixture of plasmids encoding PyCSP and murine GM-CSF, before boosting with recombinant vaccinia virus. An effective prime-boost strategy for the simian malarial model P. knowlesi has also been demonstrated. Rhesus monkeys were primed with a multicomponent, multistage <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccine</b> encoding two liver-stage antigens – the circumsporozoite surface protein (PkCSP) and sporozoite surface protein 2 (PkSSP2) – and two blood stage antigens – the apical merozoite surface protein 1 (PkAMA1) and merozoite surface protein 1 (PkMSP1p42). They were then boosted with a recombinant canarypox virus encoding all four antigens (ALVAC-4). Immunized monkeys developed antibodies against sporozoites and infected erythrocytes, and IFN-γ-secreting T-cell responses against peptides from PkCSP. Partial protection against sporozoite challenge was achieved, and mean parasitemia was significantly reduced, compared to control monkeys. These models, while not ideal for extrapolation to P. falciparum in humans, will be important in pre-clinical trials.|$|E
2500|$|Comparisons of {{antibody}} responses {{generated by}} natural (viral) infection, immunization with recombinant protein and immunization with pDNA are summarised in Table 4. DNA-raised antibody responses rise {{much more slowly}} than when natural infection or recombinant protein immunization occurs. As many as 12 weeks {{may be required to}} reach peak titres in mice, although boosting can decrease the interval. This response is probably due to the low levels of antigen expressed over several weeks, which supports both primary and secondary phases of antibody response. <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccine</b> expressing HBV small and middle envelope protein was injected into adults with chronic hepatitis.

2500|$|The {{choice of}} a viral vector to deliver genetic {{material}} to cells comes with some logistical problems. There are {{a limited number of}} viral vectors available for therapeutic use. [...] Any of these few viral vectors can cause the body to develop an immune response if the vector is seen as a foreign invader. Once used, the viral vector cannot be effectively used in the patient again because it will be recognized by the body. If the vaccine or gene therapy fails in clinical trials, the virus can’t be used again in the patient for a different vaccine or gene therapy in the future. Pre-existing immunity against the viral vector could also be present in the patient rendering the therapy ineffective for that patient. It is possible to counteract pre-existing immunity when using a viral vector for vaccination by priming with a non-viral <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccine,</b> but this method presents another expense and obstacle in the vaccine distribution process. Pre-existing immunity may also be challenged by increasing vaccine dose or changing the vaccination route. Some shortcomings of viral vectors (such as genotoxicity and low transgenic expression) can be overcome through the use of [...] hybrid vectors.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{increase}} {{the potency of}} <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines,</b> we constructed genetic fusion vaccines encoding antigen, secretion signal, and/or chemokine RANTES. The <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> encoding secreted hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were constructed by inserting HBsAg gene into an expression vector with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -targeting secretory signal sequence. The plasmid encoding secretory HBsAg (pER/HBs) was fused to cDNA of RANTES, generating pER/HBs/R. For comparison, HBsAg genes were cloned into pVAX 1 vector with no signal sequence (pHBs), and further linked to the N-terminus of RANTES (pHBs/R). Immunofluorescence study showed the cytoplasmic localization of HBsAg protein expressed from pHBs and pHBs/R, but not from pER/HBs and pER/HBs/R at 48 h after transfection. In mice, RANTES-fused <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> more effectively elicited the levels of HBsAg-specific IgG antibodies than pHBs. All the <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> induced higher levels of IgG 2 a rather than IgG 1 antibodies. Of RANTES-fused vaccines, pER/HBs/R encoding the secreted fusion protein revealed much higher humoral and CD 8 + T cell-stimulating responses compared to pHBs/R. These {{results suggest that the}} immunogenicity of <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> could be enhanced by genetic fusion to a secretory signal peptide sequence and RANTES...|$|R

50|$|The study regimen {{started with}} a set of three immunizations over eight weeks. These three {{injections}} were with a <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccine</b> which was intended to prime the immune system. This vaccine contained genetic material artificially modeled after - but not containing or derived from - surface and internal structures of HIV. 24 weeks (6 months) after a volunteer began the study regimen, that person would get a single injection of the study vaccine. This vaccine was a recombinant <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccine</b> based on adenovirus 5 as a live vector vaccine which was carrying artificial genetic material matching HIV antigens of the three major HIV subtypes.|$|E
40|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{have been}} used widely in {{experimental}} primate models of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but their effectiveness has been limited. In this study, we evaluated three technologies for increasing the potency of <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> in rhesus macaques. These included DNA encoding Sindbis virus RNA replicons (pSINCP), cationic poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) microparticles for DNA delivery, and recombinant protein boosting. The DNA-based pSINCP replicon vaccines encoding HIV Gag and Env were approximately equal in potency to human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven conventional <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> (pCMV). The PLG microparticle DNA delivery system was particularly effective at enhancing antibody responses induced by both pCMV and pSINCP vaccines and had less effect on T cells. Recombinant Gag and Env protein boosting elicited rapid and strong recall responses, {{in some cases to}} levels exceeding those seen after DNA or DNA/PLG priming. Of note, Env protein boosting induced serum-neutralizing antibodies and increased frequencies of gamma interferon-producing CD 4 T cells severalfold. Thus, PLG microparticles are an effective means of delivering <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> in nonhuman primates, as demonstrated for two different types of <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> encoding two different antigens, and are compatible for use with DNA prime-protein boost regimens...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} known since the {{discovery}} of <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> 3 ̆e 20 y ago that <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> can function as adjuvants. Our recent study reported the involvement of Aim 2 as the sensor of <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> in eliciting Ag-specific Ab responses. Our findings indicated the presence of previously unrecognized innate immune response pathways {{in addition to the}} TLR 9 pathway, which is mainly activated by the CpG motifs of <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Our data further demonstrated the requirement of type I IFN in DNA vaccine-induced immune responses via the Aim 2 pathway, but the exact downstream molecular mechanism was not characterized. In the present study, we investigated the roles of the putative DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGas), as well as the downstream IFN regulatory factors (IRF) 3 and 7 in type I IFN induction and Ag-specific immune responses elicited by DNA vaccination. Our results showed that DNA vaccine-induced, Irf 7 -dependent signaling, as part of the Sting pathway, was critical for generation of both innate cytokine signaling and Ag-specific B and T cell responses. In contrast, Irf 3 was not as critical as expected in this pathway and, more surprisingly, immune responses elicited by <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> were not cGas-dependent in vivo.

50|$|A {{major goal}} {{recently}} in HIV-1 vaccinations is eliciting the broadly neutralizing antibodies before {{the virus is}} actually established, since the virus integrates itself into the host's <b>DNA.</b> <b>Vaccine</b> trials have been largely unsuccessful in eliciting a response using mimics of the env region, potentially because of its high genetic variability.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose the}} {{replacement}} of endogenous epitopes with foreign epitopes to exploit the highly immunogenic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as a vaccine vector to elicit disease-protective cytotoxic T-Iymphocyte (CTL) responses. Locations were defined within the HBsAg gene where replacements of DNA encoding HBsAg epitopes may be made to generate functional recombinant (r) HBsAg <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines.</b> We demonstrate that rHBsAg <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> encoding multiple copies of a model tumor epitope from human papillornavirus (HPV) elicit enhanced CTL responses compared to rHBsAg <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> encoding a single copy. We show that rHBsAg <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> elicit a marked prophylactic and long-lived therapeutic protection against epitope expressing tumor, although protective efficacy was not improved by {{increasing the number of}} copies of the tumor epitope DNA.

While all eight plasmids induced specific humoral responses, the constructs expressing the TPA fusions generally evoked higher antibody responses in vaccinated hosts. Although most of the <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> tested induced a substantial gamma interferon response in the spleen, the antigen-specific lung responses were 2 - to 10 -fold lower than the splenic responses {{at the time of}} challenge. <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> encoding the ESAT- 6, MPT- 64, and KatG antigens fused to TPA signal sequences evoked significant protective responses in mice aerogenically challenged with low doses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Erdman 17 to 21 days after the final immunization. However, the protective response induced by live Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine was greater than the response induced by any of the <b>DNA</b> <b>vaccines</b> tested.
