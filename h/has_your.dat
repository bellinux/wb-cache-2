500|$|After several {{recording}} {{sessions with}} writers and producers like Paul Epworth, Fraser T Smith and Rick Rubin, Adele got enough material {{for creating a}} full LP. She released her second studio album on 19 January 2011 under the title 21. Adele first intended to title the album Rolling in the Deep, her adaptation of the slang phrase [...] "roll deep", which summarises how she felt about her relationship; in her loose translation, the phrase refers to having someone [...] "that <b>has</b> <b>your</b> back" [...] and always supports you. However, the singer later deemed the title too confusing for some of her audiences. Although {{she had wanted to}} avoid the number motif of her debut, Adele considered [...] "21" [...] the most fitting title as it represented her age {{at the time of the}} album's composition, serving as an autobiographical period piece, [...] and symbolised the personal maturity and artistic evolution since her debut.|$|E

2500|$|Mormons often {{respond to}} these accusations by {{questioning}} whether critics like Johnson and Cannon really have Mormons' best interests at heart. For Brigham Young University's 100 Hour Board, the [...] "anti-Mormon" [...] label serves the purpose of warning Latter-day Saints away from individuals who espouse [...] "hatred and bigotry". It is better, says the Board, for a confused Saint to [...] "talk to someone... that (1) <b>has</b> <b>your</b> best interests at heart, and (2) actually understands what the Church teaches." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Metropolitan Police Service has {{assigned}} 450 detectives to {{hunt for}} rioters and looters. The list of photographed looters has been made available on their website.

2500|$|The {{reception}} of iOS 7 was mixed. Mark Rogowsky of Forbes criticized multiple {{aspects of the}} new design, including the 3D effect on the home screen wallpaper, writing that [...] "the interaction between iOS 7 and the screen background is challenging at best", and writing that the new overall design language for the operating system [...] "now <b>has</b> <b>your</b> icons fly into the screen whenever you unlock it {{like some kind of}} videogame effect. It's pointless, delays your access to the phone by {{a fraction of a second}} and is arguably distracting". Joshua Topolsky of The Verge also criticized the design, noting lack of icon consistency in different parts of the OS, as well as writing that [...] "instead of correcting issues with the notification panel and alerts, Apple has simply given them a fresh coat of paint and several layers of sub-navigation [...] doing nothing to actually speed up your productivity on the device." ...|$|E
2500|$|A unique {{feature of}} the service is the {{chanting}} of the Lamentations or Praises (Enkōmia), which consist of verses chanted by the clergy interspersed between the verses of Psalm 119 (which is, by far, the longest psalm in the Bible). The Enkōmia are the best-loved hymns of Byzantine hymnography, both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited {{to each other and}} to the spirit of the day. They consist of 185 tercet antiphons arranged in three parts (stáseis or [...] "stops"), which are interjected with the verses of Psalm 119, and nine short doxastiká ("Gloriae") and Theotókia (invocations to the Virgin Mary). The three stáseis are each set to its own music, and are commonly known by their initial antiphons: , [...] "Life in a grave", , [...] "Worthy it is", and , [...] "All the generations". [...] Musically they can be classified as strophic, with 75, 62, and 48 tercet stanzas each, respectively. The climax of the Enkōmia comes during the third stásis, with the antiphon [...] "Ō glyký mou Éar", a lamentation of the Virgin for her dead Child ("O, my sweet spring, my sweetest child, where <b>has</b> <b>your</b> beauty gone?"). The author(s) and date of the Enkōmia are unknown. Their High Attic linguistic style suggests a dating around the 6th century, possibly before the time of St. Romanos the Melodist.|$|E
