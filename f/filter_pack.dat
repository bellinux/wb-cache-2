50|$|At {{the bottom}} of wells, based on formation, a {{screening}} device, <b>filter</b> <b>pack,</b> slotted casing, or open bore hole is left to allow {{the flow of water}} into the well. Constructed screens are typically used in unconsolidated formations (sands, gravels, etc.), allowing water and a percentage of the formation to pass through the screen. Allowing some material to pass through creates a large area filter out {{of the rest of the}} formation, as the amount of material present to pass into the well slowly decreases and is removed from the well. Rock wells are typically cased with a PVC liner/casing and screen or slotted casing at the bottom, this is mostly present just to keep rocks from entering the pump assembly. Some wells utilize a <b>filter</b> <b>pack</b> method, where an undersized screen or slotted casing is placed inside the well and a filter medium is packed around the screen, between the screen and the borehole or casing.

40|$|Abstract [...] Existing {{methods of}} {{measuring}} atmospheric aerosol strong acidity adequately prevent neutral-ization of fine-particle acidity by removing coarse alkaline particles and gaseous ammonia from air samples. However, these techniques {{do not consider}} particle interactions on the collection medium; therefore, they may still underestimate the actual aerosol acidity. Assessment ofacid neutralization due to such interactions is made possible using annular denuder technology {{in conjunction with a}} newly designed <b>filter</b> <b>pack.</b> The amount of sulfate-related acidity neutralized by the collected ammonium nitrate (and possibly ammonium chloride and organic acid ammonium salts) is determined. Laboratory data suggest that large fractions of sulfate-related aerosol acidity are neutralized by ammonium nitrate particles during collection on filter media. Field data from the Harvard Acid Aerosol Health Effects Study also suggest that ammonium nitrate and possibly other ammonium salts, such as ammonium chloride, neutralize collected acid aerosols. For low-acid aerosol concentrations, the correction factor is significant; whereas, for high-acid concentrations, correction isnegligible.

The US EPA is interested in supplementing CASTNet with semi-continuous monitoring systems at select sites to characterize atmospheric chemistry and deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds at higher time resolution than the <b>filter</b> <b>pack.</b> The Monitor for AeRosols and GAses in ambient air (MARGA) measures water-soluble gases and aerosols at an hourly temporal resolution. The performance of the MARGA was assessed under the US EPA Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) program. The assessment was conducted in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, from 8 September to 8 October 2010 and focused on gaseous SO 2, HNO 3, and NH 3 and aerosol SO 4 2 -, NO 3 -, and NH 4 +. Precision of the MARGA was evaluated by calculating the median absolute relative percent difference (MARPD) between paired hourly results from duplicate MARGA units (MUs), with a performance goal of ≤ 25 %. The accuracy of the MARGA was evaluated by calculating the MARPD for each MU relative to the average of the duplicate denuder/filter pack concentrations, with a performance goal of ≤ 40 %. Accuracy was also evaluated by using linear regression, where MU concentrations were plotted against the average of the duplicate denuder/filter pack concentrations. From this, a linear least squares line of best fit was applied. The goal was for the slope of the line of best fit to be between 0. 8 and 1. 2. The MARGA performed well in comparison to the denuder/filter pack for SO 2, SO 4 2 −, and NH 4 +, with all three compounds passing the accuracy and precision goals by a significant margin. The performance of the MARGA in measuring NO 3 - could not be evaluated due to the different sampling efficiency of coarse NO 3 - by the MUs and the <b>filter</b> <b>pack.</b> Estimates of "fine" NO 3 - were calculated for the MUs and the <b>filter</b> <b>pack.</b> Using this and results from a previous study, it is concluded that if the MUs and the <b>filter</b> <b>pack</b> were sampling the same particle size, the MUs would have good agreement in terms of precision and accuracy. The MARGA performed moderately well in measuring HNO 3 and NH 3, though neither met the linear regression slope goals. However, recommendations for improving the measurement of HNO 3 and NH 3 are discussed.

40|$|AbstractThe PVC screens {{of recent}} {{monitoring}} wells (MWs) have thin slots {{and a low}} open area, usually in the 2 – 8 % range. The MW screen and <b>filter</b> <b>pack</b> may cause important head losses which are not taken into account when interpreting the data of permeability tests performed using the MW. The equivalent hydraulic conductivity K of usual PVC screens was defined by hydraulic tests in a water tank, which have shown that gas micro-bubbles, a common problem in MWs and filter packs, contribute to increase the parasitic head losses. Closed-form equations and numerical models are used to explain by how much a field permeability test in a MW under evaluates an aquifer K value due to parasitic head losses in the screen and <b>filter</b> <b>pack.</b> The MW can properly measure the local soil K value {{only if it is}} markedly lower than the maximum MW value as obtained in a water tank. The MW measuring capacity can reach 5 × 10 − 3 m/s for large slots and deaired water, but is most often between 10 − 5 and 10 − 4 m/s for small slots in field conditions, and it can be only 10 − 6 m/s for poorly designed and installed MWs.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the data, observations, methods, assumptions, and {{decisions for the}} design of the Relief Well Rehabilitation Project in the Right Abutment Drainage Tunnel at Chief Joseph Dam. Chief Joseph Dam (CJD) is a dam on the Columbia River and is owned and operated by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). It is the second only to Grand Coulee dam as the largest producer of hydropower in the United States. The right abutment drainage tunnel contains wooden stave relief wells. Water flows from these wells which reduces the hydrostatic pressure in the right abutment of the dam. The 22 wells in the floor of the tunnel are 60 years old and are in need of rehabilitation. The objective of this project is to control the groundwater gradient, prevent the movement of sediment, stop total screen collapse, and prevent initiation of backwards erosion and piping in the abutment. The rehabilitation solution is to install new stainless steel screens into the existing wells, backfill the annular space between the old wooden screen and the new stainless steel screens with a 3 / 8 -inch pea gravel <b>filter</b> <b>pack,</b> and install a new top cap to hold the new screen in place. This report documents the data, observations, and methods used to complete the final design. During tunnel inspections USACE geologists observed dislodged end plugs and evidence of sediment movement out of the formation. The relief wells have historically high flows between 6, 000 gallons per minute (gpm) to 9, 000 gpm. New screens are designed based on as-built data and historic tunnel flow. The new screens are 8 -in diameter, 100 slot (0. 10 -inch) screens. We found that screen diameter and slot size would provide adequate transmitting capacity for most of the relief wells. The <b>filter</b> <b>pack</b> gradation is based on descriptions from foundation construction reports. I found that 3 / 8 -inch pea gravel is appropriate for the abutment material.
