5|$|In nature, sixteen {{repositories}} {{were discovered}} at the Oklo mine in Gabon where natural nuclear fission reactions took place 1.7 billion years ago. The fission products in these natural formations {{were found to}} have moved less than 10ft (3 m) over this period, though the lack of movement may be due more to retention in the uraninite structure than to insolubility and sorption from moving ground water; uraninite crystals are better preserved <b>here</b> <b>than</b> those in spent fuel rods because of a less complete nuclear reaction, so that reaction products would be less accessible to groundwater attack.|$|E

25|$|The {{cemetery}} {{was established}} {{prior to the}} war, but became known as a burial ground for casualties of the conflict when many were buried there, particularly after the nearby Battle of Saratoga, when a hundred bodies were reportedly put in one mass grave.

In 1872, due to continued growth of traffic in the region, the area called Messina Springs was purchased by the railroad to establish the DeWitt Yard.|$|E

Most importantly, mangroves are a transition from the marine to freshwater and terrestrial systems, and provide critical habitat for numerous species of small fish, crabs, shrimps and other crustaceans that adapt to feed and shelter, and reproduce among the tangled mass of roots, known as pneumatophores, which grow upward from the anaerobic mud to get the supply of oxygen. Fishing cats, macaques, wild boars, common grey mongooses, foxes, jungle cats, flying foxes, pangolins, and spotted deer are also found in abundance in the Sundarbans.|$|E
25|$|Köppen climate {{classification}} Dfc: The northernmost {{parts of}} Ontario—primarily north of 50°N {{and with no}} major cities in the area—have a subarctic climate (Köppen) with long, severely cold winters and short summers, with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons. In summer, hot weather occasionally reaches even the northernmost parts of Ontario for brief periods, although humidity is generally lower than in the south. With no major mountain ranges blocking sinking Arctic air masses, temperatures of −40°C (−40°F) are not uncommon. The snow stays on the ground much longer <b>here</b> <b>than</b> in other regions of Ontario; snow cover is usually present to some extent between October and May.|$|E

25|$|As an {{industrial}} centre Madrid retains its advantages in infrastructure, as a transport hub, {{and as the}} location of headquarters of many companies. Industries based on advanced technology are acquiring much more importance <b>here</b> <b>than</b> {{in the rest of}} Spain. Industry contributed 7.5% to Madrid's value-added in 2010. However, industry has slowly declined within the city boundaries as more industry has moved outward to the periphery. Industrial Gross Value Added grew by 4.3% in the period 2003–2005, but decreased by 10% during 2008–2010. The leading industries were: paper, printing & publishing, 28.8%; energy & mining, 19.7%; vehicles & transport equipment, 12.9%; electrical and electronic, 10.3%; foodstuffs, 9.6%; clothing, footwear & textiles, 8.3%; chemical, 7.9%; industrial machinery, 7.3%.|$|E
25|$|After {{the conquest}} {{and during the}} colonial period, many other spices and {{ingredients}} were brought and have had a greater influence in the cooking <b>here</b> <b>than</b> {{in other parts of}} the country. From Europe, the Spanish brought saffron, parsley, thyme, marjoram, bay laurel, and cilantro as well Asian spices such as cloves, cinnamon, and black pepper. The Spaniards also brought wheat, rice, almonds, olives and olive oil, garlic, and capers. The latter three are essential ingredients in what is perhaps the most famous specialty of the region, huachinango a la veracruzana, red snapper in a spicy tomato sauce. Caribbean imports such as sugar cane and pineapple were adapted as well as the peanut, brought from Africa by the Portuguese via Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Phytoplankton {{accumulation}} {{is primarily}} {{the result of}} residence time. The north Delta and Suisun Bay have relatively low residence times due to the high volume of water moving through the region for downstream flow and for export to southern California. Since water moves more rapidly through {{this part of the}} system, the rate of accumulation decreases as productivity is advected out of the system. In contrast, parts of the southern Delta have a higher residence time due to the low volume of water moving through the system; in fact the water on occasion runs backwards, {{due to the lack of}} inflow from the San Joaquin River, and export pumping. During summer, phytoplankton density may be an order of magnitude higher <b>here</b> <b>than</b> in other parts of the estuary.|$|E
