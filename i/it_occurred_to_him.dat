5|$|The 1891 census {{records the}} Wildes' {{residence}} at 16 Tite Street, {{where he lived}} with his wife Constance and two sons. Wilde though, not content with being better known than ever in London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the salons littéraires, including the famous mardis of Stéphane Mallarmé, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua, had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play, Salomé, written rapidly and in French.|$|E
25|$|The {{pioneer of}} {{lacrosse}} in Victoria (and Australia as a whole) was a Canadian, Lambton L. Mount. He {{came to the}} Victorian goldfields as a fourteen-year-old {{with his family in}} 1853 {{but it was not until}} 1875 that he was moved to revive his early boyhood memories of lacrosse. After watching the football final between Carlton and Melbourne in that year <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that lacrosse was a superior game.|$|E
25|$|Cameron {{quit his}} job as a truck driver to enter the film {{industry}} after seeing Star Wars in 1977. When Cameron read Syd Field's book Screenplay, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that integrating science and art was possible, and he wrote a 10-minute science-fiction script with two friends, titled Xenogenesis. They raised money, rented camera, lenses, film stock and studio then shot it in 35mm. They dismantled the camera to understand how to operate it and spent the first half-day of the shoot {{trying to figure out how}} to get it running.|$|E
60|$|Mr Milvey smiled again, as {{he remarked}} to himself 'Those {{kings and queens}} were always wishing for children.' <b>It</b> <b>occurring</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> perhaps, {{that if they had}} been Curates, their wishes might have tended in the {{opposite}} direction.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> didn't <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> at {{the moment}} that the man meant <b>to</b> arrest <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Shaking {{in every}} limb from cold and fear, {{she put her}} hand to the lock; the key was not there. She tried the nail; there was nothing there. Her wary gaoler had evidently carried it away with <b>him</b> <b>to</b> his room. Would <b>it</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do the same {{in the case of the}} back door? It was very {{possible}} that he might have overlooked it. She retraced her steps down the passage, passed Mrs. Jorrocks' room, where the old woman was snoring peacefully, and began to make her way as best she could through the great rambling building.|$|R
25|$|In 2006 California {{attorney}} and Marshall Islands lobbyist Howard Hills, and Tony Sanchez, a former {{administrator of the}} Guam Superior Court, were indicted for unlawful influence, conspiracy for unlawful influence, theft of property held in trust, and official misconduct for allegedly authorizing 36 payments of $9,000 vis a vis a pre-existing contract between Hills and the Guam Superior Court, each written out to Hills, but funneled to Abramoff. Hills, trusting Sanchez as a court official at face value, assumed {{that this was a}} temporary circumstance and agreed to help facilitate transition for {{what he thought was a}} standard government contract between Abramoff and the court. For this Hills received no compensation. Before indictments or investigations were initiated, Hills halted his temporary contract with Abramoff and reported what he thought was potentially suspicious behavior to public officials when <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that something may be wrong. In 2007, superseding indictments were issued against Hills and Sanchez, and in 2008 further related indictments were handed down against Abramoff and Abramoff's firm at the time, Greenberg Traurig. The charges against both attorney Howard Hills and Greenberg Traurig have since been dismissed.|$|E
25|$|During a June 2, 1875, {{experiment}} by Bell and {{his assistant}} Thomas Watson, a receiver reed {{failed to respond to}} the intermittent current supplied by an electric battery. Bell told Watson, who was {{at the other end of}} the line, to pluck the reed, thinking it had stuck to the pole of the magnet. Mr. Watson complied, and to his astonishment Bell heard a reed at his end of the line vibrate and emit the same timbre of a plucked reed, although there were no interrupted on-off-on-off currents from a transmitter to make it vibrate. A few more experiments soon showed that his receiver reed had been set in vibration by the magneto-electric currents induced in the line by the motion of the distant receiver reed in the neighborhood of its magnet. The battery current was not causing the vibration but was needed only to supply the magnetic field in which the reeds vibrated. Moreover, when Bell heard the rich overtones of the plucked reed, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that since the circuit was never broken, all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into undulating (modulated) currents, which in turn would reproduce the complex timbre, amplitude, and frequencies of speech at a distance.|$|E
2500|$|According to Adams, {{the idea}} for the title {{occurred}} to him while he lay drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria, gazing at the stars. He was carrying a copy of the Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe, and <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that [...] "somebody ought to write a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". He later said that the constant repetition of this anecdote had obliterated his memory of the actual event.|$|E
60|$|Ethel {{thought this}} {{indicated}} that Geraldine took a marked {{interest in the}} man. She wondered if <b>it</b> had <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Laird {{recalled}} that {{the publication of}} the first issue of his and Eastman's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic came about thanks to a loan the two secured from Quentin Eastman, Kevin's uncle. Although the two were able to pay him back swiftly, it led Laird to speculate about what could have been: [...] "if we hadn't gotten that loan from him at that point in our lives, it might have taken us a couple more months to raise that money from other sources, and who knows what might have happened differently {{as a result of that}} delay?" [...] <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that [...] "there must be so many times where a self-publishing venture can sink or float on the strength of" [...] a relatively small amount of money, so he felt a desire to use some of his [...] "good fortune, in the financial sense, to help people out" [...] (and, in addition to the creators, the Foundation also aids those [...] "involved in charitable organizations").|$|E
2500|$|Ray had {{not thought}} about a trilogy while making Aparajito, and <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> only after being asked about the idea in Venice. The final {{installation}} of the series, Apur Sansar (The World of Apu), was made in 1959. A number of critics find {{this to be the}} supreme achievement of the trilogy (Robin Wood, Aparna Sen). Ray introduced two of his favourite actors, Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore, in this film. The film finds Apu living in a nondescript Kolkata house in near-poverty. He becomes involved in an unusual marriage with Aparna, the scenes of their life together forming [...] "one of the cinema's classic affirmative depiction of married life", but tragedy ensues. After Apur Sansar was harshly criticised by a Bengali critic, Ray wrote an article defending it—a rare event in Ray's filmmaking career (the other major instance involved the film Charulata, Ray's personal favourite). His success had little influence on his personal life in the years to come. Ray continued to live with his mother, uncle and other members of his extended family in a rented house.|$|E
2500|$|According to Schafer, {{he came up}} {{with the}} idea for Full Throttle while {{listening}} to a traveller's tales about time spent in an Alaskan biker bar. As he listened, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that [...] "bikers are kind of like pirates — like another culture that people don't have a window into most of the time, but [...] has its own rules", and might provide a neat alternative to a fantasy setting. So he began his research into biker culture, reading Hunter S. Thompson's [...] The game originally would have featured an interactive sequence where Ben undergoes a peyote-induced hallucinogenic trip. This was eventually cut from the game, because the developers couldn't get it to [...] "work out" [...] with the publisher. The concept eventually became the basis of Psychonauts. Schafer recalls the reaction from the management at LucasArts as being one of [...] "'We can't believe we paid you to write this.'" [...] "They hated it" [...] he stated. In an interview with Gamasutra, Shafer stated that the biker aesthetics of the game were an appeal to fantasy. He stated the team was depending [...] "on the [...] secret desire to be a biker: big, tough, cool. Riding a huge hog..." [...] On the game's setting he noted that often it was mistaken for a post apocalyptic world, however he clarified that the setting was simply an alternate world which was more desolate than our own. [...] "It was never meant to be post-war or anything like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With the {{greatest}} possible solicitude avoid authorship. Too early or immoderately employed, {{it makes the}} head waste and the heart empty; even were there no other worse consequences. A person, who reads only to print, to all probability reads amiss; and he, who sends away through the pen and the press every thought, the moment <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> will {{in a short time}} have sent all away, and will become a mere journeyman of the printing-office, a compositor." ...|$|R
60|$|Others then {{must have}} {{escaped from the}} campong. Von Horn {{loosened}} his guns in their holsters, and took a fresh grip upon his bull whip as he urged Sing forward upon the trail. He wondered which one it was, but not once did <b>it</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that the latest result of Professor Maxon's experiments could be the rescuer of Virginia Maxon. In his mind he could see only the repulsive features {{of one of the}} others.|$|R
60|$|He rose to {{his feet}} and stepped toward the bell. Then <b>it</b> {{suddenly}} <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that as yet she had not spoken. He turned quickly around.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that {{it would}} {{save a lot of}} trouble to destroy the {{advertisement}} there and then.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{went upstairs}} to his wife {{with a cup of}} tea because she was ill, and because <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|She laughed softly. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{that nothing}} like her laugh {{had ever been}} heard on that gray-walled stretch of {{mountain}} road.|$|E
60|$|Maitland bowed again, and {{wondered}} more than ever. <b>It</b> did <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> that the fewer people knew of so delicate a business {{the better for}} Margaret's sake.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, it is {{the best}} name; I hope she will like it. But, hollo, John, where did you drop from?' as <b>it</b> {{suddenly}} <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be surprised.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} in his {{somewhat}} incoherent epic Freddie paused. <b>It</b> had <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that he had perhaps laid himself open to a charge of monopolising the conversation.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned on}} his heel. A row was impossible. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that {{a man of the}} world would face such a {{position}} calmly.|$|E
60|$|She {{laughed at}} him. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> suddenly, {{with a little}} pang, {{that he had never}} heard her laugh before. It was like music.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{that it was}} {{unnecessary}} to explain. He assisted me into a sitting position, and I could see with my own eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "N--no!" [...] said Lingard, looking {{suddenly}} confused. <b>It</b> had <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{that for}} the first time in two years or more he had forgotten, utterly forgotten, these people's existence.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> never <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{how much}} simpler {{it would be}} to write a letter. The item for [...] "traveling expenses" [...] in his bill of costs must be {{something}} enormous.|$|R
