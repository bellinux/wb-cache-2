However, ISO has high possibility to make camera noise which is visual distortion. Too much dependence on ISO can distort the image. For that reason, the photographers must understand ISO before using it.|$|E

5000|$|Leizhou stone dog is a {{heritage}} product blending the ancestors' tradition of totem worship integrated with different ethnic cultures. In ancient times Leizhou Peninsula was a stink, dense, wild land {{with a small}} population.

To that end, the children are shut inside one bedroom of the mansion, only {{with access to the}} mansion's attic via a secret stairway. It is on their first day there that their grandmother reveals the shocking truth of what caused Corrine to be disowned and stricken from her father's will years ago: Corrine's husband was really her uncle, her father's brother, making their love incestuous and their children the product of incest. When Corrine finally returns to the children that night, she is forced to show the children that she had been savagely bullwhipped by her mother as punishment for her marrying her uncle and having children from the union. Corrine confesses to the children that she and their father were niece and uncle, and her parents were livid as they believed Corrine disgraced the family; the children do not say anything but seem to accept it. Corrine tells the children that her parents made it clear that if she had any children by her uncle she would be disinherited, but because her father doesn't know about them she still has a chance to get the money when he passes away. She says that their confinement will only be for a short time: her father is deathly ill, and once she is able to convince him to secure her inheritance, they will be free and they will leave.|$|E

Consequently, particle retention could cause resistance to fluid flow and distribution in drainage and imbibition.|$|E
