5|$|Ron, {{who has an}} {{extremely}} deadpan and masculine personality, actively works to make city hall less effective and despises interacting with the public. He loves meat, woodworking, hunting, whisky, and breakfast foods. He hates and fears his two ex-wives, both named Tammy, {{one of whom is}} played by Offerman's real-life wife, Megan Mullally. Ron claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him but actually cares a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> his colleagues, and has a particularly strong respect for Leslie.|$|E
5|$|During their expeditions aboard Mir, {{the astronauts}} carried out various experiments, {{including}} growth of crops and crystals, and took hundreds {{of photographs of}} the Earth spinning serenely beneath them. They also assisted in the maintenance and repair of the aging station, following various incidents with fires, collisions, power losses, uncontrolled spins and toxic leaks. In all, the American astronauts would spend almost a thousand days aboard Mir, allowing NASA to learn a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> long-duration spaceflight, particularly {{in the areas of}} astronaut psychology and how best to arrange experiment schedules for crews aboard space stations.|$|E
5|$|Later, Means and Black {{listen to}} McKenna reading {{a passage from}} the Bible. Afterwards, McKenna reveals that she knows a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> the Polaroid Man who kidnapped Black weeks earlier. Means {{receives}} a vision herself during the conversation, and becomes convinced that McKenna is a prophet of some sort. Black thinks the girl is acting out, but Means reveals that she is reciting passages from the non-canonical Gnostic Gospels, which supposed that Mary Magdalene was the only disciple to fully understand the teachings of Jesus Christ. Means believes the girls are not seeing visions of Saint Mary, but of Mary Magdalene.|$|E

5|$|Leclerc learnt a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> how {{to handle}} and supply a force {{advancing}} across the desert, and was rewarded with the British Distinguished Service Order. He began planning a far more ambitious advance into Libya. This was delayed by a year due to Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel's defeat of the British Eighth Army in the Battle of Gazala, and the subsequent German and Italian advance into Egypt. Leclerc was promoted to Général de brigade in August 1941, and pinned two metal stars captured from the Italians on his kepi.|$|E
5|$|When {{he moved}} to Salisbury, Allen met Thomas Young, a doctor living and {{practicing}} just across the provincial boundary in New York. The doctor, only five years older than Allen, taught the younger Allen a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> philosophy and political theory, while Allen {{was able to bring}} to Young his appreciation of nature and life on the frontier. Young and Allen eventually decided to collaborate on a book intended to be an attack on organized religion, as Young had convinced Allen to become a Deist. They worked on the manuscript until 1764, when Young moved away from the area, taking the manuscript with him.|$|E
5|$|The first Space Shuttle {{flight to}} Mir was a {{rendezvous}} mission without docking on STS-63. This was followed {{during the course}} of the project by a total of 9 Shuttle-Mir docking missions, from STS-71 to STS-91. The Shuttle rotated crews and delivered supplies, and one mission, STS-74, carried a docking module and a pair of solar arrays to Mir. Various scientific experiments were also conducted, both on shuttle flights and long-term aboard the station. The project also saw the launch of two new modules, Spektr and Priroda, to Mir, which were used by American astronauts as living quarters and laboratories to conduct the majority of their science aboard the station. These missions allowed NASA and the Roskosmos to learn a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> how best to work with international partners in space and how to minimize the risks associated with assembling a large space station in orbit, as would have to be done with the ISS.|$|E

5|$|After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude García Márquez {{returned}} to Europe, this time bringing along his family, {{to live in}} Barcelona, Spain, for seven years. The international recognition García Márquez earned {{with the publication of}} the novel led to his ability to act as a facilitator in several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas, including the former 19th of April Movement (M-19), and the current FARC and ELN organizations. The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president Fidel Castro, which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship. It was during this time that he was punched in the face by Mario Vargas Llosa in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature. In an interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature: “Ours is an intellectual friendship. It may not be widely known that Fidel is a very cultured man. When we’re together, we talk a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> literature.” This relationship was criticized by Cuban exile writer Reinaldo Arenas, in his 1992 memoir Antes de que Anochezca (Before Night Falls).|$|E
5|$|In 1680, Zotov {{embarked}} on a three-year diplomatic mission to the Crimea; sources disagree on whether this was before or after he tutored Peter. When Peter left the Kremlin to spend his childhood at Preobrazhenskoye, two years after Zotov's departure, his memories of the tutors who had taught his siblings, Feodor and Sophia, were so negative that he cut himself off from traditional academic subjects for a time. He later resumed his studies under Afanassyi Nesterov and Zotov after the latter's return from the Crimea. Although Peter sought to learn of nature and military matters rather than literature or theology, he nevertheless {{learned a great deal}} of the latter from his tutors. Zotov (and later his sons) later worked with Peter to translate books about fortification from a Western European language into Russian. Peter did not learn, or forgot, a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> mathematics, a subject that he had to learn properly in his late teens for use in siege warfare and fortification. In later years, Peter regretted his lack of a fuller education, and sought to give his daughters Anne and Elizabeth educations equivalent of any European princess.|$|E
5|$|Wyler felt Tunberg's {{draft was}} too much of a {{morality}} play overlaid with current Western political overtones, and that the dialogue was too modern-sounding. Zimbalist brought in playwright S. N. Behrman (who also wrote the script for Quo Vadis) and then playwright Maxwell Anderson to write drafts. Gore Vidal biographer Fred Kaplan states that British poet and playwright Christopher Fry was hired simultaneously with Vidal, although most sources (including Vidal himself) state that Vidal followed Anderson, and that Fry did not come aboard until Vidal was close to leaving the picture. Vidal arrived in Rome in early March 1958 to meet with Wyler. Vidal claimed that Wyler had not read the script, and that when he did so (at Vidal's urging) on his flight from the U.S. to Italy, he was upset with the modernist dialogue. Vidal agreed to work on the script for three months so that he would come off suspension and fulfill his contract with MGM, although Zimbalist pushed him to stay throughout the entire production. Vidal was researching a book on the 4th century Roman emperor Julian and knew a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> ancient Rome.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{we know a}} <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> early Gaelic law, {{often called}} Brehon Laws, which helps {{reconstruct}} native legal practices. In the twelfth century, and certainly in the thirteenth, strong continental legal influences began to have more effect, such as Canon law and various Anglo-Norman practices.|$|E
25|$|In 1969 the McMahons {{moved to}} Gaithersburg, Maryland. McMahon {{worked as a}} {{receptionist}} at the corporate law firm of Covington & Burling.

McMahon learned a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> intellectual property rights, which she found useful in her later career.|$|E
25|$|In August 1944, Horthy {{replaced}} Sztójay {{with the}} anti-Fascist General Géza Lakatos. Under the Lakatos regime, acting Interior Minister Béla Horváth ordered Hungarian gendarmes {{to prevent any}} Hungarian citizens from being deported. The Germans were unhappy with the situation, but could not do a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> it. Horthy's actions thus bought the Jews of Budapest {{a few months of}} time.|$|E

25|$|Murals in tombs {{dating from}} Goguryeo also reveal a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> the {{architecture}} of that period {{as many of them}} depict buildings which have pillars with entasis. Many have capitals on top of them. The murals reveal that the wooden bracket structures and coloring on the timbers, all characteristic of later Korean structures, were already in use at that time.|$|E
25|$|These pages {{deal with}} {{scientific}} subjects generally but also specifically as they touch upon {{the creation of}} artworks. In relating to art, this is not science that is dependent upon experimentation or the testing of theories. It deals with detailed observation, particularly the observation of the natural world, and includes a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> the visual effects of light on different natural substances such as foliage.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Egyptian tombs and temples {{contained}} {{thousands of}} paintings, sculptures, and written works, which reveal a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> {{the people of}} that time. However, their depictions of themselves in their surviving art and artifacts are rendered in sometimes symbolic, rather than realistic, pigments. As a result, ancient Egyptian artifacts provide sometimes conflicting and inconclusive evidence of the ethnicity {{of the people who}} lived in Egypt during dynastic times.|$|E

During his stay with them in the winter and spring of 1712-1713, Weiser endured hardships of cold, hunger and homesickness, but he learned a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> the Mohawk language and the customs of the Iroquois. Conrad Weiser returned to his own people towards the end of July 1713.|$|E
25|$|Over {{recent decades}} cancer {{research}} has discovered a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> the genetic variety {{of types of}} cancer that appear the same in traditional pathology. There has also been increasing awareness of tumour heterogeneity, or genetic diversity within a single tumour. Among other prospects, these discoveries raise the possibility of finding that drugs that have not given good results applied to a general population of cases may yet be successful for a proportion of cases with particular genetic profiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{mass media}} face {{a number of}} {{pressures}} that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims {{in terms of their}} credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter. Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover.|$|E
