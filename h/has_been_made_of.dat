In the meantime, the closest equivalent to Regional Eurostar services are same-station connections with East Midlands Trains and Thameslink, changing at St Pancras. The recent {{construction of a new}} concourse at adjacent King's Cross Station has improved interchange with St Pancras and provided Virgin Trains East Coast, Great Northern, Hull Trains and Grand Central services with easier connections to Eurostar.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the portraits on the Makkotai coins are {{that they do not}} have {{identical}} head sizes and some facial features also vary from one coin to another, even though they all have the same written legend. Such an observation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> coins assigned to the Western Kshatrapas of Gujarat, which are thought to be another inspiration for the Chera coins. Scholars who analyzed the varying portraiture on the Kshatrapa coins have advanced several theories to explain the phenomenon: that the coins could be of different kings who chose to keep the name of an ancestor on their coins or the coins all belong to one king with portraits depicting him at his different ages. Based on such theories, the Chera coins could either belong to a series of rulers or to a single king called Cheraman Makkotai.|$|E

25|$|McKean Island is the northwesternmost {{island of}} the Phoenix group. Its area is 57 hectares, and devoid {{of fresh water}} or trees, though {{it does have a}} hypersaline lagoon in its center. Carpeted with low herbs and grasses, McKean {{provides}} a sanctuary for the world's largest nesting population of lesser frigatebird (Fregata ariel), with a population of up to 85,000 birds. Actively worked for guano in the mid-19th century, it was abandoned by 1870, and no further use <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|E
25|$|Recent archaeological {{excavations}} {{of earlier}} fishing settlements are occurring at some pace. A fishing village recently excavated in Khanh Hoa, Vietnam, is thought be about 3,500 years old. Excavations on the biblical fishing village Bethsaida, {{on the shore}} of the Sea of Galilee and birthplace of the apostles Peter, Philip and Andrew, have shown that Bethsaida was established in the tenth century BCE. A Tongan fishing village, recently excavated, appears to have been founded 2900 years ago. This makes it the oldest known settlement in Polynesia. Another recent excavation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> Walraversijde, a medieval fishing village on the coast of West Flanders in Belgium.|$|E

25|$|Sari {{and her two}} pups (Tito and Shasta) were {{delivered}} by a TWA cargo plane to Kansas City via New York City from Rome on 7 October 1950. Sari was later bred with Vizsla Rex. The male Vizsla Rex del Gelsimino, born 8/1/49, was purchased for $75 in food, clothing, medicine, and other supplies thanks to Belgrade's US Embassy employee M. M. Yevdjovich who provided the direct connection to the owner in Stapar, Serbia to Tallman's representative Harry R. Stritman.

25|$|In late 2004, in {{effort to}} {{maintain}} {{the balance of power}} in the region, Chen began eagerly pushing for an US$18billion arms purchase from the United States, but the Pan-Blue Coalition repeatedly blocked the deal in the legislature. Criticism <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> this, citing contradictory arguments used, such as that the weapons were not what Taiwan needed, or that the weapons were a good idea but too expensive. By late 2006, the KMT had signalled it would support some of the arms sale being approved, but failed to pass a revised arms bill by the end of the legislative session in early 2007, despite promises by then KMT chairman, Ma Ying-jeou, to do that.|$|E
25|$|An insolvent's {{status as}} such is {{terminated}} by rehabilitation. A court may grant a rehabilitation order on application by the insolvent within a comparatively short {{time of the}} sequestration, where the claims have been paid in full or where an offer of composition has been accepted by the creditors and payment <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> at least 50 cents in the rand on all claims. Otherwise, periods varying from twelve months to five years must have elapsed. These periods vary according {{to whether or not}} claims have been proved, whether or not the insolvent's estate has been sequestrated previously, and whether or not the insolvent has been convicted of any fraudulent act of insolvency.|$|E

25|$|The Manobo are {{probably}} the most numerous of the ethnic groups of the Philippines in the relationships and names of the groups that belong to this family of languages. Mention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the numerous subgroups that comprise the Manobo group. The total Manobo population is not known, although they occupy core areas from Sarangani island into the Mindanao mainland in the provinces of Agusan del Sur, Davao provinces, Bukidnon, and North and South Cotabato. The groups occupy such a wide area of distribution that localized groups have assumed the character of distinctiveness as a separate ethnic grouping such as the Bagobo or the Higaonon, and the Atta. Depending on specific linguistic points of view, the membership of a dialect with a supergroup shifts.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that the greater rights afforded to Muslims in the Ottoman Empire {{motivated}} Christians to convert to Islam. However, {{the extent to which}} Muslims were privileged is often overestimated. The primary discrimination faced by non-Muslims was of a legal nature, as Christians and Jews were not allowed to file lawsuits or testify against Muslims in court. There were also rules of conduct imposed upon them, but there were many to whom these rules did not apply. Though much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the fact that Christian and Jewish subjects of the sultan paid a poll tax from which Muslims were exempt, Muslims were also faced with the religious zakat tax, whereas Catholics made donations to their church only on a voluntary basis.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of Do Not Adjust Your Set, a tea-time children's programme, ITV offered Gilliam, Idle, Jones, and Palin their own late-night adult comedy series together. At the same time, Chapman and Cleese were offered a show by the BBC, which had been {{impressed}} by their work on The Frost Report and At Last the 1948 Show. Cleese was reluctant to do a two-man show for various reasons, including Chapman's supposedly difficult and erratic personality. Cleese had fond memories of working with Palin on How To Irritate People and invited him to join the team. With no studio available at ITV until summer 1970 for the late-night show, Palin agreed to join Cleese and Chapman, and suggested the involvement of his writing partner Jones and colleague Idle—who in turn wanted Gilliam to provide animations for the projected series. Much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> {{the fact that the}} Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.|$|E

25|$|In the 1660s Newton {{studied the}} motion of colliding bodies, and deduced that the centre of mass of two colliding bodies remains in uniform motion. Surviving manuscripts of the 1660s also show Newton's {{interest}} in planetary motion and that by 1669 he had shown, for a circular case of planetary motion, that the force he called 'endeavour to recede' (now called centrifugal force) had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center. After his 1679–1680 correspondence with Hooke, described below, Newton adopted the language of inward or centripetal force. According to Newton scholar J Bruce Brackenridge, although much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the change in language and difference of point of view, as between centrifugal or centripetal forces, the actual computations and proofs remained the same either way. They also involved the combination of tangential and radial displacements, which Newton was making in the 1660s. The difference between the centrifugal and centripetal points of view, though a significant change of perspective, did not change the analysis. Newton also clearly expressed the concept of linear inertia in the 1660s: for this Newton was indebted to Descartes' work published 1644.|$|E
25|$|The Hercules site gained {{independence}} from Dupont {{as a result}} of federal anti-trust action in 1912. Hercules Powder Company contributed significantly to the production of explosives during both World Wars. By the Second World War, the plant had diversified to produce fertilizers and other chemical products. Eventually the facility was out-competed by foreign manufacturers, and the plant was closed in 1976. However, by this time the surrounding area was experiencing rapid growth as the commuter belt moved further outward from San Francisco. By the mid-1970s, home construction companies began to build new subdivisions and changed Hercules into the residential suburb as it was known up until the late 1990s. Back in the 1970s, Hercules {{was one of the first}} cities in the United States to develop a comprehensive Noise Element of the General Plan. This work included the production of noise contour maps for all major highways and arterial roads, as well as a citywide mitigation plan. Considerable study <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the heavy metal lead accumulated as upper layer soil contamination from prior air pollution smokestack emissions from the California Powder Works operations from this era.|$|E
25|$|In the end, five American battleships were sunk, {{three were}} damaged, and eleven other cruisers, destroyers, and {{auxiliaries}} were sunk or seriously damaged. The Japanese lost only 29 aircraft, while 74 were damaged by anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} ground. The damaged aircraft were disproportionately dive and torpedo bombers, seriously impacting available firepower to exploit the first two waves' success, so {{the commander of the}} First Air Fleet, Naval Lieutenant-General Chuichi Nagumo, withdrew. Yamamoto later lamented Nagumo's failure to seize the initiative to seek out and destroy the US carriers, absent from the harbor, or further bombard various strategically important facilities on Oahu. Nagumo had absolutely no idea where the American carriers might be, and remaining on station while his forces cast about looking for them ran the risk of his own forces being found first and attacked while his aircraft were absent searching. In any case, insufficient daylight remained after recovering the aircraft from the first two waves for the carriers to launch and recover a third before dark, and Nagumo's escorting destroyers lacked the fuel capacity for him to loiter long. Much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> Yamamoto's hindsight, but, in keeping with Japanese military tradition not to criticize the commander on the spot, he did not punish Nagumo for his withdrawal.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{most of her}} novels, {{which had}} a print run of only several hundred copies, the Livess print run of about 4,000 for each volume became, {{in the words of}} one scholar, [...] "one of her most {{influential}} political interventions". However, Shelley's biographies have not been fully appreciated until recently. The Lives were not reprinted until 2002, and little study <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> them because of a critical tradition that [...] "dismiss the Lives as hack work churned out rapidly in order to pay off debts".|$|E
500|$|For most of {{the nineteenth}} and twentieth centuries, Mary Shelley {{was known as the}} author of Frankenstein and the wife of famous Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. As late as 1961, Rambles had never been reprinted and, as scholar Elizabeth Nitchie explained, [...] "scant use <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> it, and copies of it are rather scarce." [...] However, she argued that some of Mary Shelley's [...] "best writing" [...] was in Rambles. Novelist Muriel Spark agreed in her book on Shelley, writing that Rambles [...] "contains more humour and liveliness than occur in {{anything}} else she wrote". In the 1970s, with the rise of feminist literary criticism, scholars began to pay attention to Shelley's other works. With the publication of scholarship by Mary Poovey and Anne K. Mellor in the 1980s, Mary Shelley's [...] "other" [...] works—her short stories, essays, reviews, dramas, biographies, travel narratives, and other novels—began to be recognised as literary achievements. In the 1990s, Mary Shelley's entire corpus, including Rambles, was reprinted.|$|E
