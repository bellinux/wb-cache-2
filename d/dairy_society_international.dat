40|$|<b>Dairy</b> <b>societies</b> in Kenya, {{like many}} Africa {{countries}} {{are carried out}} by small-scale dairy farmers located in the rural areas, often with low literacy levels and very few technological skills. For dairy cooperatives to survive they have to streamline their operations and improve their management processes to have positive balance sheet and surplus money to pay dividends to their members, therefore, the study assessed the relationship between selected technology adoption and organizational performance of <b>dairy</b> <b>societies</b> in Uasin Gishu County in Kenya. The study specifically determined the relationship between financial technologies, Information communication technologies, human resources information system, and storage and processing technologies on organization performance of <b>dairy</b> <b>societies.</b> The study was informed by Diffusion of Innovation theory (DOI) and Theory of Constraints (TOC. It adopted explanatory research design and a census of all the <b>dairy</b> cooperative <b>societies</b> in Uasin Gishu County was conducted. Quantitative data collected was analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques and inferential statistics such as Pearson moment correlations and Multiple regression model. The study concluded that financial technologies adoption, information communication technology adoption and storage and processing technologies adoption are important determinants of performance of <b>dairy</b> <b>societies.</b> However, human resources information system had no significant effect on performance of <b>dairy</b> <b>societies...</b>|$|R
