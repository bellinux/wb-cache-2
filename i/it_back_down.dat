25|$|Aside {{from the}} story of Chang'e (Vietnamese: Hằng Nga), {{there are two other}} popular folktales {{associated}} with the festival.

The tree began to float towards the moon, and Cuội, trying to pull <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> to earth, floated to the moon with it, leaving him stranded there. Every year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, children light lanterns and participate in a procession to show Cuội the way back to Earth. The other tale involves a carp who wanted to become a dragon, and as a result, worked hard throughout the year until he was able to transform himself into a dragon.|$|E

The cyclone made its closest approach to the island of New Caledonia on January30; shortly after that, Beni weakened into a tropical depression.

60|$|Dominey, {{changed into}} {{ordinary}} morning clothes, {{with a thick}} cord tied round his body, a revolver in his pocket, and a loaded stick in his hand, spent {{the remainder of the}} night and part of the early morning concealed behind a great clump of rhododendrons, his eyes fixed upon the shadowy stretch of park which lay between the house and the Black Wood. The night was moonless but clear, and when his eyes were once accustomed to the pale but sombre twilight, the whole landscape and the moving objects upon it were dimly visible. The habits of his years of bush life seemed instinctively, in those few hours of waiting, to have reestablished themselves. Every sense was strained and active; every night sound--of which the hooting of some owls, disturbed from their lurking place in the Black Wood, was predominant--heard and accounted for. And then, just as he had glanced at his watch and found that it was close upon two o'clock, came the first real intimation that something was likely to happen. Moving across the park towards him he heard the sound of a faint patter, curious and irregular in rhythm, which came from behind a range of low hillocks. He raised himself {{on his hands and knees}} to watch. His eyes were fastened upon a certain spot,--a stretch of the open park between himself and the hillocks. The patter ceased and began again. Into the open there came a dark shape, the irregularity of its movements swiftly explained. It moved at first upon all fours, then on two legs, then on all fours again. It crept nearer and nearer, and Dominey, as he watched, laid aside his stick. It reached the terrace, paused beneath Rosamund's window, now barely half a dozen yards from where he was crouching. Deliberately he waited, waited for what he knew must soon come. Then the deep silence of the breathless night was broken by that familiar, unearthly scream. Dominey waited till even its echoes had died away. Then he ran a few steps, bent double, and stretched out his hands. Once more, for the last time, that devil's cry broke the deep stillness of the August morning, throbbing a little as though with a new fear, dying away as though the fingers which crushed <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> the straining throat had indeed crushed with it the last flicker of some unholy life.|$|E
