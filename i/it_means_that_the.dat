5|$|Equality before law: Article 14 of the {{constitution}} guarantees that all people shall be equally protected {{by the laws of}} the country. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> State will treat people in the same circumstances alike. This article also means that individuals, whether citizens of India or otherwise shall be treated differently if the circumstances are different.|$|E
5|$|Methods in {{programming}} language are {{the members of}} a class in a project, some methods have signatures and some don't have signatures. Methods can be void or can return something like string, integer, double, decimal, float and bool. If a method is void <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> method does not return any data type.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{arrives at}} Ornara, and Sobi and Langor {{have agreed to}} provide the Felicium to the Ornarans for later payment. However, Picard announces that as the Prime Directive {{prevents}} him from interfering in the transactions between the two planets, it also prevents him from providing any replacement parts for the aging freighters. T'Jon and Romas are furious at the decision as <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> trade between Ornara and Brekka will stop because the freighters can no longer make the trips without the parts. After the four are transported off the Enterprise, Picard confides to Dr. Crusher that while the Ornarans may suffer from withdrawal symptoms in the short term, {{this will be an}} opportunity for both races to advance in their own ways.|$|E
50|$|If the {{relative}} strength index is below 50, <b>it</b> generally <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stock's losses {{are greater than}} the gains. When {{the relative}} strength index is above 50, <b>it</b> generally <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gains are greater than the losses.|$|R
5000|$|Residing [...] "continuously" [...] in {{the state}} does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> party can not have left the state {{during the period of}} {{residency}} nor does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> party does not have another residence elsewhere outside New York.|$|R

5|$|The {{artifact}} shows {{a number}} of idiosyncrasies that raise questions concerning its authenticity. The numbering systems used in the codex conflict. The Maya bar-and-dot system is used to mark units, but the central Mexican dot system is used to mark multiples of twenty (for example by using 11 dots instead of 2 bars and a dot, as {{would be the case}} in the bar-and-dot system where a bar indicates 5 and a dot indicates 1). Some bar-and-dot numbers are placed within a cartouche decorated with a knot at the top. The only other instance of such a cartouche being used with numbers is in the Dresden Codex, where the cartouche has a very specific function, indicating a negative date count from the zero year of the great cycle of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar (roughly equivalent to the function of BC in the Gregorian calendar). In the Grolier Codex, where the numbers mark intervals between stations of Venus, the use of this cartouche appears meaningless, although it is suggested that <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> codex may be read both from the front and from the back.|$|E
25|$|The first {{position}} {{is probably the}} most common one. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> “pure” dingo should be preserved via strong control measures and only “pure” or mostly “pure” dingoes should get protection.|$|E
25|$|M (Marker): (1 bit) Used at the {{application}} level and {{defined by a}} profile. If it is set, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> current data has some special relevance for {{the application}}.|$|E
50|$|Because the Ice-Out {{designation}} {{is based}} on the judgment of one person, it is unscientific. The call does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lake is entirely devoid of ice, nor does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> MS Mount Washington actually does go to each of its ports. <b>It</b> simply <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ship could.|$|R
40|$|The high debt {{levels in}} the {{independent}} care sector, and the reliance of services on <b>it,</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> quality of care is being compromised. Lee Humber explains how the market model for the care and support for people with learning disabilities came to change in recent years, and why the current system is, at best, economically inviable...|$|R
5000|$|CTUWS {{criticized the}} conviction. [...] "What does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> when courts seek to imprison citizens, who publish {{the facts about}} {{corruption}} cases? The allegations against Ibrahim {{were found to be}} true and were the basis for the legal decision... Does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> courts are offering immunity to corrupt officials, that they are offering protection against any criticism or disclosure?" ...|$|R
25|$|Some {{supplies}} are zero-rated (exempt {{with a credit}} for input tax). When a supply is zero-rated, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> supply falls {{within the scope of}} the VAT Act, but output VAT shall not be calculated as the rate is zero. Newspapers, books and periodicals are zero-rated.|$|E
25|$|Modern digital desks can emulate preheat and dimmer {{curves and}} allow a soft patch {{to be done}} in memory. This is often {{preferred}} as <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dimmer rack can be exchanged for another one without having to transfer complicated settings. Many different curves, or profiles can be programmed and used on different channels.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, the {{category}} whose objects are the sets of NF and whose morphisms are the functions between those sets is not cartesian closed; {{this is a}} highly desirable property for any set theory to have. Intuitively, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> functions of NF do not curry as one would normally expect functions to. Furthermore, it means that NF is not a topos.|$|E
50|$|This {{system is}} {{co-operative}} depending, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> case of transponder failure no aircraft detection will be provided.|$|R

25|$|Substitution – {{systematic}} {{replacement of}} one sound by an alternative, easier one to articulate (substitution process – stopping, fronting, gliding). <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> young toddler may use sounds that {{are easier to}} produce instead of the proper sound in a word. We may see that the child replace the 'r' sound with 'l' or 'w', the 'n' with 'd' and so on.|$|E
25|$|This fact {{is used in}} interplanetary travel. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{amount of}} delta-v to reach other planets, over and above that to reach escape {{velocity}} can be much less if the delta-v is applied when the rocket is travelling at high speeds, close to the Earth or other planetary surface; whereas waiting until the rocket has slowed at altitude multiplies up the effort required to achieve the desired trajectory.|$|E
25|$|Desensitization of the postsynaptic receptors is a {{decrease}} {{in response to the}} same neurotransmitter stimulus. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> strength of a synapse may in effect diminish as a train of action potentials arrive in rapid succession – a phenomenon that gives rise to the so-called frequency dependence of synapses. The nervous system exploits this property for computational purposes, and can tune its synapses through such means as phosphorylation of the proteins involved.|$|E

5000|$|... "What does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{opposition}} has 60% of the vote? It {{is as if}} a farmer told you that he had 60 animals in his manor. Are those pigs or calves? Are those chicken or geese? Whereas every sensible farmer and man would know that, compared to such a flock, a single stud, let alone a pair of studs or cows, {{is worth more than}} an entire flock." ...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} distinctions is that no negative score is assigned in the scoring system of the Smith–Waterman algorithm, which enables local alignment. When any element has a score lower than zero, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sequences up to this position have no similarities; this element will then be set to zero to eliminate influence from previous alignment. In this way, calculation can continue to find alignment in any position afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Off Indicator: An {{illuminated}} off indication {{means the}} associated signal is showing a proceed aspect. These are mainly used at stations, {{for the benefit}} of the train-crew and platform staff. When the display is blank, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> associated signal is at danger. An illuminated indication CD (close doors) is an instruction to close the train's power-operated doors. An illuminated indication RA or R (right away) means that station duties are complete and the train may depart.|$|E
25|$|Because {{thyristors}} {{can only}} be turned on (not off) by control action, and rely on the external AC system to effect the turn-off process, the control system only has one degree of freedom – when {{to turn on the}} thyristor. This limits the usefulness of HVDC in some circumstances because <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> AC system to which the HVDC converter is connected must always contain synchronous machines in order to provide the commutating voltage – the HVDC converter cannot feed power into a passive system.|$|E
3000|$|..., {{decreasing}} P {{reduces the}} chance of holding <b>the</b> inequality (10). <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> when <b>the</b> relay’s received SNR decreases, OWR may start performing better than MWR.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{beginning}} of Cosmos appears to be problematic. Not only ancient theological, but also present-day physical approaches evoke many questions. They originate in the definition of time, its dimensionality and its scale. If we accept the Standard Model, all physical processes including processes utilised in clocks (chronometric processes) lose their theoretical basis {{in the vicinity of the}} initial singularity. The singularity is hidden behind horizon. Does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> singularity did not exist...|$|R

25|$|The {{arrest of}} Norwegian Jews {{happened}} about {{one year before}} the arrests in Denmark, and also before the Soviet victory at Stalingrad, which changed nearby Sweden's stand from being supportive of the Germans to lean towards the Allies. As there was considerable contact between the resistance in Denmark and Norway through neutral Sweden <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Danes knew what fate the Danish Jews were destined for. That Sweden had changed to lean towards the Allies also meant that it was open for Jewish refugees, which had not been the case before and early in the war.|$|E
25|$|The {{assumption}} that the free field is identically zero {{is the core of}} the absorber idea. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> radiation emitted by each particle is completely absorbed by all other particles present in the universe. To better understand this point, it may be useful to consider how the absorption mechanism works in common materials. At the microscopic scale, it results from the sum of the incoming electromagnetic wave and the waves generated from the electrons of the material, which react to the external perturbation. If the incoming wave is absorbed, the result is a zero outgoing field. In the absorber theory the same concept is used, however, in presence of both retarded and advanced waves.|$|E
25|$|A full {{container}} load (FCL) is an ISO {{standard container}} that is loaded and unloaded under the risk and account of one shipper and only one consignee. In practice, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> whole container is intended for one consignee. FCL container shipment tends to have lower freight rates than an equivalent weight of cargo in bulk. FCL is intended to designate a container loaded to its allowable maximum weight or volume, but FCL in practice on ocean freight does not always mean a full payload or capacity - many companies will prefer to keep a 'mostly' full container as a single container load to simplify logistics and increase security compared to sharing a container with other goods.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We discuss {{possible}} {{relationships between}} geometric and topological in-teractions {{on one side}} and physical interactions on the other side. This paper is a follow up of [2]. We will here discuss possible interactions of families of particles. By a particle we mean a system or an (extended) object in some space. The families may be finite, countable or uncountably infinite. P = {Pi}i∈I What does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> particles interact?
