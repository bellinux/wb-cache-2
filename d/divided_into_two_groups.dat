5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2012 tournament, the {{qualifying}} round will be eliminated, and the 16 {{teams will be}} <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> of eight, with each team playing seven games in the preliminary round.|$|E
5|$|These parasites' name {{refers to}} the {{cavities}} in their holdfasts (Greek τρῆμα, hole), which resemble suckers and anchor them within their hosts. The skin of all species is a syncitium, a layer of cells that shares a single external membrane. Trematodes are <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> Digenea and Aspidogastrea (also known as Aspodibothrea).|$|E
5|$|Tuberous sundews: These nearly 50 Australian species form an {{underground}} tuber {{to survive the}} extremely dry summers of their habitat, re-emerging in the autumn. These so-called tuberous sundews can be further <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> those that form rosettes and those that form climbing or scrambling stems. Tuberous sundews comprise the subgenus Ergaleium.|$|E

5|$|The {{candidates}} were <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> - one officially {{supported by the}} party and the 'independents' (broadly following the communist party line but not declared members of the party). The latter would be only considered if over half of the registered voters in the district voted against the official candidates; otherwise all seats from the district (on average between 3 and 6) would be awarded to the official candidates.|$|E
5|$|The women's tournament uses {{a similar}} {{qualification}} format. The top six {{teams in the}} IIHF Women's World Ranking after the 2008 Women's World Ice Hockey Championships received automatic berths. Teams ranked 13th and below were <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> for a first qualification round in September 2008. The two group winners advanced to the second qualification round, where the teams ranked seventh through twelfth joined them.|$|E
5|$|There {{is another}} {{concrete}} definition of evenness: if {{the objects in}} a set can be placed into two groups of equal size, then the number of objects is even. This definition {{is equivalent to the}} first one. Again, zero is even because the empty set can be <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> of zero items each.|$|E

5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{subspecies}} have been named, of which 12 were recognised in the Handbook of the Birds of the World. These subspecies are <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group, and the Oriental P. d. indicus group. Several Middle Eastern subspecies, including P. d. biblicus, are sometimes considered a third, intermediate group. The subspecies P. d. indicus {{was described as a}} species, and was considered to be distinct by many ornithologists during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Edmontosaurus was {{a wide-ranging}} genus in both time and space. The rock units {{from which it}} is known can be <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> by age: the older Horseshoe Canyon and St. Mary River formations, and the younger Frenchman, Hell Creek, and Lance formations. The time span covered by the Horseshoe Canyon Formation and {{equivalents}} {{is also known as}} Edmontonian, and the time span covered by the younger units is also known as Lancian. The Edmontonian and Lancian time intervals had distinct dinosaur faunas.|$|E
50|$|The seven {{teams were}} <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>group,</b> each team playing the others once. The top two {{qualified}} for the medals group, while the rest played for the 5th-7th places.|$|R
50|$|The {{competition}} was <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>group</b> stages, with a knockout tournament at the end. Before the tournament, 11 {{of the nations}} were seeded according to their 2001 FIFA ranking, while New Caledonia was placed last by default, as {{it was not a}} FIFA member.|$|R
30|$|Another {{factor that}} determines {{the group is}} process. The four samples from the Shaoxing WWTP are <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>group</b> samples (Group 2 and Group 3) {{in regard to the}} higher {{abundance}} of Proteobacteria in group 2. This might be ascribed to different processes as the <b>two</b> samples of <b>group</b> 2 were from Shaoxing WWTP-I which adopts AO processes whereas the samples of group 3 were from the carrousel oxidation ditches.|$|R
5|$|Insects can be <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> {{historically}} {{treated as}} subclasses: wingless insects, known as Apterygota, and winged insects, known as Pterygota. The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless {{order of the}} silverfish (Zygentoma). Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles, while Zygentoma and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia. The Zygentoma themselves possibly are not monophyletic, with the family Lepidotrichidae being a sister group to the Dicondylia (Pterygota and the remaining Zygentoma).|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{zoologist}} John Veron and {{his co-workers}} analyzed ribosomal RNA in 1996 to obtain similar results to Romano and Palumbi, again concluding that the traditional families were plausible but that the suborders were incorrect. They also established that stony corals are monophyletic, including all the descendants of a common ancestor, but that they are <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> the robust and complex clades. Veron suggested that both morphological and molecular systems be used in future classification schemes.|$|E
5|$|The Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) {{is a body}} {{composed}} of representatives from the states (ambassadors, civil servants etc.) who meet each week to prepare the work and tasks of the Council. It monitors and co-ordinates work and deals with the Parliament on co-decision legislation. It is <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> of the representatives (Coreper II) and their deputies (Coreper I). Agriculture is dealt with separately by the Special Committee on Agriculture (SCA). The numerous working groups submit their reports to the Council through Coreper or SCA.|$|E

50|$|The tournament {{participants}} was <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>group</b> of four invited under-17 national teams. The winners of group {{play in the}} final, the second place teams play match for the 3rd place, the third team in group play match for 5th place. Since 2009 the teams played 3 round-robin 90-minute matches.|$|R
5|$|The eight living pelican {{species were}} {{traditionally}} <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> one containing four ground-nesters with mainly white adult plumage (Australian, Dalmatian, great white, and American white pelicans), and one containing four grey or brown plumaged species which nest preferentially either in trees (pink-backed, spot-billed and brown pelicans), or on sea rocks (Peruvian pelican). The largely marine brown and Peruvian pelicans, formerly considered conspecific, are sometimes {{separated from the}} others by placement in the subgenus Leptopelicanus but in fact species with both sorts of appearance and nesting behavior are found in either.|$|E
5|$|The thorax is <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> of somites. The {{anterior}} {{group is}} composed of four somites, each with well-developed walking limbs with lengths that extend past {{the margins of the}} carapace. Their morphological details are not well preserved but their distal segments appear to possess a multitude of small spines. It is unknown if these limbs are biramous, but they are assumed to be the endopodites, the inner branches (ramus) of the leg, with the exopodites, or outer branches, absent or not preserved.|$|E
5|$|Uranus's {{irregular}} moons {{range in}} size from 120–200km (Sycorax) to about 20km (Trinculo). Unlike Jupiter's irregulars, Uranus's show no correlation of axis with inclination. Instead, the retrograde moons can be <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> based on axis/orbital eccentricity. The inner group includes those satellites closer to Uranus (a < 0.15 rH) and moderately eccentric (~0.2), namely Francisco, Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo. The outer group (a > 0.15 rH) includes satellites with high eccentricity (~0.5): Sycorax, Prospero, Setebos, and Ferdinand.|$|E

5|$|Based {{on recent}} DNA-analysis, the genus Ploceus is almost {{certainly}} polyphyletic. If all species currently included in the genus would remain and the genus would be made monophyletic, {{it would have to}} encompass the entire subfamily Ploceinae. The Ploceinae can be <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> In the first group, the widowbirds and bishops (genus Euplectes) are sister to a clade in which the genera Foudia and Quelea are closest relatives and which further includes the Asiatic species of Ploceus, i.e. P. manyar, P. philippinus, P. benghalensis, P. megarhynchus, (and P. hypoxanthus, although untested). Since Georges Cuvier picked P. philippinus as the type species, these five species would logically remain assigned to the genus Ploceus.|$|E
5|$|Controlled {{experiments}} with colonies of Cerapachys biroi suggest {{that an individual}} may choose nest roles based on her previous experience. An entire generation of identical workers was <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made certain that the other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.|$|E
5|$|In February–March 2007 New Horizons {{spacecraft}} {{conducted a}} deep {{search for new}} small moons inside the main ring. While no satellites larger than 0.5km were found, the cameras of the spacecraft detected seven small clumps of ring particles. They orbit just inside the orbit of Adrastea inside a dense ringlet. The conclusion, that they are clumps and not small moons, is based on their azimuthally extended appearance. They subtend 0.1–0.3° along the ring, which correspond to 1000–3000km. The clumps are <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> of five and two members, respectively. The nature of the clumps is not clear, but their orbits are close to 115:116 and 114:115 resonances with Metis. They may be wavelike structures excited by this interaction.|$|E
