50|$|So {{it seems}} that with Adam's yeti dead, the whole yeti species are extinct for good…or are they? Adam <b>drops</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> {{that he is now}} {{pregnant}} with the yeti's child.|$|R
6000|$|... "Number one--police-station, please.--Hullo there! The {{inspector}} about?--That you, Inspector?--Sir Henry Cranston speaking. Could {{you just}} step round?--Good! Tell {{them to show}} you straight into the library. You might just <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to Mills about the lights, eh? Thank you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Finally Blacky {{decided to}} <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to Dusky the Black Duck. So {{the next morning}} he stopped for a call. [...] "Good morning," [...] said he, as Dusky swam in just in front of him. [...] "I hope you are feeling as fine as you look." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the Professor's own idea," [...] Quest remarked grimly. [...] "I merely {{ventured to}} <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> that Craig {{might not be}} quite so immaculate as he seemed, and I never saw a man so horrified in my life. He assured me that Craig was seldom out of his sight, that he hadn't {{a friend in the}} world nor a single vicious taste." ...|$|E
60|$|Frank, indeed, {{afterwards}} {{learned that}} the officer <b>dropped</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to the men to make {{as little as possible}} of Julian's capture, and of the vigorous resistance he had made when first seized.|$|R
6000|$|But I do {{not think}} he would have bolted from Sandgate until he had really got some more {{definite}} answer to the question, [...] "What better dreams?" [...] until he had surprised or forced some clearer illumination from the passive invalid, if Mrs. Bunting one morning had not very tactfully <b>dropped</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{field of}} {{suspects}} has been further narrowed. Esa attempts {{to flush out}} the murderer by <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> {{about the death of}} Satipy, but is herself murdered by means of poisoned unguent, despite the presence of a food taster. Henet – who knows the murderer's identity and is momentarily powerful amid the chaos – is smothered by the linens used to wrap the ever-increasing number of victims.|$|R
6000|$|... "Make your {{arrangements}} accordingly, my good brother--I {{am quite}} fresh, and {{have brought a}} good stock of sermons; not knowing how much might remain {{to be done in}} the army. Corny," [...] in a half-whisper, [...] "you can let our new friends know that I will sup with them; and, harkee--just <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to them, that I am none of your puritans." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You think you're a {{financial}} genius, I suppose," [...] he said, [...] "because you've brought {{a few things}} off. Why, you don't know the A B C of the thing. I tell you this, my friend. A Company like the Bekwando Company {{is very much like}} a woman's reputation, <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> or two, start just a bit of talk, and I tell you the flames'll soon do the work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{said the}} sergeant. [...] "I have got that bundle of colored {{handkerchiefs}} you were selling; and I'll find {{the other man}} before you're a day older. It's a pity, seeing how you've behaved so well and haven't resisted us, that you won't <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of where those ropes and stakes are hid. I might have a good word at the sessions for any one who would {{put me in the}} way of finding them." ...|$|E

60|$|In the Lords, I {{admire the}} Duke. The {{readiness}} {{with which he}} has adopted {{the air of a}} debater, shows the man of genius. There is a gruff, husky sort of a downright Montaignish naïveté about him, which is quaint, unusual, and tells. You plainly perceive that he is determined to be a civilian; and he is as offended if you <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> that he occasionally wears an uniform, as a servant on a holiday if you mention the word livery.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have it!" [...] he cried. [...] "Only {{yesterday}} Matai Shang let <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of his destination, {{telling me}} {{of a race}} of people unlike ourselves who dwell far to the north. They, he said, had always been known to the Holy Therns and were devout and faithful followers of the ancient cult. Among them would he find a perpetual haven of refuge, where no 'lying heretics' might seek him out. It is there that Matai Shang has gone." ...|$|E
60|$|Virginia met {{socially}} {{several of}} the men with whom her father was engaged {{but it was only}} at the last moment that one of them let <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of the purpose of the month's activity. When Virginia was present the conversation seemed always deftly guided from the subject of her father's immediate future, and she was not long in discerning that it was in no sense through accident that this was true. Thereafter her wounded pride made easy the task of those who seemed combined to keep her in ignorance.|$|E
6000|$|Monsieur Thuran {{had heard}} <b>dropped</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of {{something}} which {{might result from}} this unexpected visit of Lord Tennington's yacht, {{and he wanted to}} be counted in on it. Once when he was alone with the Englishman he took occasion to make it quite plain that his engagement to Miss Strong was to be announced immediately upon their return to America. [...] "But not a word of it, my dear Tennington--not a word of it." ...|$|R
60|$|And, {{giving his}} top-hat a rakish tilt, the old gentleman ambled indoors, {{satisfied}} {{that he had}} <b>dropped</b> <b>a</b> guarded <b>hint</b> in <b>a</b> pleasant and tactful manner.|$|R
60|$|He {{ought to}} have {{told her he was}} engaged. He {{ought to have}} {{explained}} things to her. Perhaps even now {{he might be able to}} <b>drop</b> her <b>a</b> <b>hint.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't address your husband, {{because his}} inhuman {{desertion}} {{of the poor}} baby does not incline me to trust him. I {{run the risk of}} trusting you--to a certain extent--at starting. Shall I <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> which may help you to identify the child, in your own mind? It would be inexcusably foolish on my part to speak too plainly, just yet. The hint must be a vague one. Suppose I use a poetical expression, and say that the young lady is enveloped in mystery from head to foot--especially the foot? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've come," [...] he said, [...] "from Emily de Reuss. No, don't {{interrupt}} me. I've a sort {{of message}} for you which isn't to be delivered as a message at all. I'm to <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to you that she {{would like you to}} go and see her, that your refusal to do so would be a little ungracious, because she came and saw you when you were ill. I'm to let you think that she's feeling a little hurt at your behaviour, and finally to work you up into going. Do you see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Polly {{clutched}} Fan at that, {{and held}} her tight, saying sternly, [...] "If you ever breathe a word, <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint,</b> look a look that will tell him or any one else about me, I 'll yes, as sure as my name is Mary Milton I 'll proclaim from the housetops that you like Ar" [...] Polly got no further, for Fan's hand was on her mouth, and Fan's alarmed voice vehemently protested, [...] "I won't! I promise solemnly I 'll never {{say a word to}} a mortal creature. Don't be so fierce, Polly; you quite frighten me." ...|$|E
50|$|Daniel Handler's {{introduction}} in Lemony Snicket's Unauthorized Autobiography continually {{introduces a}} new story about a page into the previous one, thus creating a confusing and inconsequential (but not incorrect or self-contradictory) storyline that is never finished, always dealing with the questions he is asked but never answering them. He <b>drops</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> {{in one of the}} layers that this is simply a technique to distract the reader from the fact that he never answers these questions.|$|R
6000|$|Towards {{the middle}} of 1737, it must have become common {{knowledge}} among Swift's friends in London, that he was preparing for publication his [...] "History of the Four Last Years of Queen Anne's Reign." [...] Possibly King may have <b>dropped</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of it; possibly Swift may have written to others for information and assistance. Be that as it may, on April 7th, 1737, the Earl of Oxford (son of Swift's old friend) wrote to Swift as follows: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next time}} he {{encountered}} her she had {{turned away from him}} angrily and contemptuously. And yet again, she came to him to beg his pardon, and she <b>dropped</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of <b>a</b> man somewhere, sometime,--she said not how,--who had left her with no desire to live. Her speech was frank, but incoherent, and all he gleaned from it was that the event, whatever it was, had happened years before. Also, he gleaned that she had loved the man.|$|R
60|$|So he waited, and so {{they rode}} back {{together}} to Colonel Bishop's house. They rode very slowly, at a walking pace, and some whom they passed marvelled to see the doctor-slave on such apparently intimate terms with his owner's niece. One or two may have promised themselves that they would <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to the Colonel. But the two rode oblivious of all others {{in the world that}} morning. He was telling her the story of his early turbulent days, {{and at the end of}} it he dwelt more fully than hitherto upon the manner of his arrest and trial.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no young man," [...] Mr. Bullsom said, [...] "whom I {{like so much}} {{or think}} so much of as Mr. Brooks. If I'd a son like that I'd be a proud man. And as we're here all alone, just the family, as it were, I'll go on to say this," [...] Mr. Bullsom continued, his right thumb finding {{its way to the}} armhole of his waistcoat. [...] "I'm going to <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> at the first {{opportunity}} I get, quite casually, that whichever of you girls gets married first gets a cheque from me for one hundred thousand pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Duchesne, whose {{resolute}} {{lips were}} sealed upon {{the secrets of}} half Tuolumne County, interrupted him scornfully. [...] "I cannot answer for the woman--you must talk to her yourself. As for me, generally I keep my professional visits to myself; but--" [...] he laid his hand on Rand's arm--"if I find out you're putting on any airs to that poor creature, if, on my next visit, her lips or her pulse tell me you haven't been acting on the square to her, I'll <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to drunken old Nixon where his daughter is hidden. I reckon she could stand his brutality better than yours. Good-night!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will <b>drop</b> him <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> if you like," [...] the Princess said thoughtfully, [...] "and see how {{he takes}} it. Are you sure that the game is worth the candle?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{streets were}} {{not quite as}} they had been in the morning. For instance, the {{bookshop}} at the corner was now selling fish. I <b>dropped</b> David <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of what was going on.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so glad," [...] she replied. [...] "And, Paul, hadn't {{you better}} <b>drop</b> dad <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> that Mrs. Bundercombe {{will be home}} to-morrow? I think he'd better have the shine taken off his nails!" ...|$|R
