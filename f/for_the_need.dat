5|$|A common {{justification}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for astronomy is {{the need}} to develop an accurate calendar for agricultural reasons. Ancient texts like Hesiod's Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with ecological signs, such as bird migrations to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the Mursi of Ethiopia shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times {{in some parts of the}} world. All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, the British Secret Intelligence Service Chief of Air Intelligence, Wing Commander F. W. Winterbotham, {{developed}} {{aerial photograph}} techniques {{in collaboration with}} the French. The task was to gather a record of German targets. By the summer, 1939, RAF Bomber Command's No. 2 Group RAF was carrying out this role. However, various problems with standard equipment {{led to the formation of}} specialist formations for this duty. One of the first squadrons to act as a PR (Photographic reconnaissance) unit was No. 212 Squadron RAF, which saw service in the campaigns in Western Europe, in May and June 1940 under Fighter Command's control. However, at the end of that campaign, the Admiralty pressed its case <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for coastal and sea reconnaissance. With operations now over, owing to the evacuation of northern Europe by the Allies, these reconnaissance operations were given to Coastal Command on 18 June 1940. This included the Interpretation Unit, which analysed photographic evidence. The organisation was called the PRU (Photographic Reconnaissance Unit). It was administered by No. 16 Group RAF, but under the operational control of Coastal Command.|$|E
40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{measure of}} multiple motives (EMMM) is presented. The EMMM enables researchers to make quick exploratory assessments {{of a relatively}} large number of general motives. It includes 14 single-item self-report measures that assess self-control, self-esteem, sensation-seeking, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> acquisition, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> affect, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> cognition, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> meaning, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> power, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> precision, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> self-consistency, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> structure, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> uniqueness, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to belong, and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to buffer anxiety about death. Each single-item measure is sourced from previously-established psychometric scales. The EMMM’s rationale, development, operationalization, analysis, and exploratory nature are discussed, and evidence is provided <b>for</b> <b>the</b> divergent and convergent validity of its items. It {{is considered to be}} the Swiss Army knife of motivation measures: A small but versatile tool <b>for</b> understanding <b>the</b> complexity of human attitudes and behaviours...|$|R

5|$|The small burns {{that are}} tributaries to the East Burn {{contributed to the}} {{draining}} of the lands of Dunnikier Estate. The burn emerges from a deep-set culvert to flow under the Victoria Viaduct, down a deep gorge, through the site of Hutchison's Flour Mills before running parallel to the harbour wall and into the sea. From the mid-19th century, the Hutchison's buildings became a significant landmark adjacent to the burn. The flour millers chose this area for its railway connection which linked the main station to the harbour, rather than <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to use the burn to power the mills. The West (or Tiel) Burn, was also important, providing power for textile mills. This burn flowed out of the Raith Estate lands where scenically and recreationally {{it was used to}} create Raith Lake (with its tributary, the Dronachy Burn). The mill owners in Linktown also made use of the burn.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli's {{theological}} stance {{was gradually}} revealed through his sermons. He attacked moral corruption {{and in the}} process he named individuals who were the targets of his denunciations. Monks were accused of indolence and high living. In 1519, Zwingli specifically rejected the veneration of saints and called <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to distinguish between their true and fictional accounts. He cast doubts on hellfire, asserted that unbaptised children were not damned, and questioned the power of excommunication. His attack on the claim that tithing was a divine institution, however, had the greatest theological and social impact. This contradicted the immediate economic interests of the foundation. One of the elderly canons who had supported Zwingli's election, Konrad Hofmann, complained about his sermons in a letter. Some canons supported Hofmann, but the opposition never grew very large. Zwingli insisted that he was not an innovator and that the sole basis of his teachings was Scripture.|$|E

The Początek i progres wojny moskiewskiej (The {{beginning}} and Progress of the Muscovy War), published in 1612, is a critique of Zygmunt's policies. In 1612 he became a teacher and tutor of Stanisław Koniecpolski, future hetman and military commander. Also that year he returned to Ukraine to defend against continuing Tatar and Moldovan incursions, as well as Cossack unrest. In 1616 during a Sejm he presented a project O chowaniu żołnierza kwarcianego (On the raising of the kwarciane soldiers), in which he argued <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to raise a larger army {{to deal with the}} Tatars and the Cossacks. The project was however not approved by the parliament.|$|E

5|$|In 1932 Wilkinson {{was invited}} by the India League {{to join a}} small delegation, to report on {{conditions}} in India. During the three-month visit she met Gandhi, then in prison, and became convinced that his co-operation was essential to any prospect of peace in the subcontinent. On her return home she delivered her conclusions in an uncompromising report, The Condition of India, published in 1934. She visited Germany shortly after Hitler {{came to power in}} 1933, and published a pamphlet, The Terror in Germany, that documented early incidents of Nazi outrage. She collaborated with a refugee from Hitler's Germany, Edward Conze, to produce a major book, Why Fascism?, which condemned the Labour Party's gradualism and focus upon parliament as well as the failure of communist strategy, arguing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for grassroots workers' unity and revolution to check the threat of fascism across Europe. Meanwhile, her parliamentary prospects had been revived by her selection as Labour candidate for Jarrow, a Tyneside shipbuilding town. Jarrow had been devastated early in the 1930s by the run-down and closure of Palmers shipyard, the town's main source of employment. Early in 1934 Wilkinson led a deputation of Jarrow's unemployed to meet the prime minister, MacDonald, in his nearby Seaham constituency, and received sympathy but no positive action. She was unimpressed by the government's Special Areas Act, passed late in 1934 and designed to assist distressed areas such as Jarrow; she thought the legislation provided inadequate funding, and benefited employers more than workers.|$|E
