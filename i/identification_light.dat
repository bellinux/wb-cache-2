40|$|ABSTRACT A 51 -year-old patient {{underwent}} posterior vitrectomy with perfluoropropane gas injection, phacoemulsification, and implantation of an Oft CrylÂ® hydrophilic acrylic {{intraocular lens}} (IOL) because of traumatic retinal detachment and cataract {{in the right}} eye. On the first postoperative day, gas was filling the anterior chamber because of patient's non-compliance in terms of head positioning, and was reabsorbed within one week. Eight months later, the patient returned complaining of {{a significant decrease in}} vision. IOL opacification was noticed by slit-lamp examination. The lens was explanted to undergo gross and light microscopic analysis. The lens was also stained with the alizarin red method for calcium <b>identification.</b> <b>Light</b> microscopic analysis confirmed the presence of granular deposits, densely distributed in an overall circular pattern in {{the central part of the}} lens optic. The granules stained positive for calcium. This is the first case of the opacification of this type of hydrophilic lens. Surgeons should be aware of this potential postoperative complication, and the use of hydrophilic IOLs should be avoided in procedures involving intracameral gas because of the risk of IOL opacification...|$|E
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2008, the NASA Meteoroid Environments Office (MEO) began to {{establish}} a video fireball network, based on the following objectives: (1) determine the speed distribution of cm size meteoroids, (2) determine the major sources of cm size meteoroids (showers/sporadic sources), (3) characterize meteor showers (numbers, magnitudes, trajectories, orbits), (4) determine the size at which showers dominate the meteor flux, (5) discriminate between re-entering space debris and meteors, and 6) locate meteorite falls. In order to achieve the above with the limited resources available to the MEO, it was necessary that the network function almost fully autonomously, with very little required from humans {{in the areas of}} upkeep or analysis. With this in mind, the camera design and, most importantly, the ASGARD meteor detection software were adopted from the University of Western Ontario's Southern Ontario Meteor Network (SOMN), as NASA has a cooperative agreement with Western's Meteor Physics Group. 15 cameras have been built, and the network now consists of 8 operational cameras, with at least 4 more slated for deployment in calendar year 2013. The goal is to have 15 systems, distributed in two or more groups east of automatic analysis; every morning, this server also automatically generates an email and a web page ([URL] containing an automated analysis of the previous night's events. This analysis provides the following for each meteor: UTC date and time, speed, start and end locations (longitude, latitude, altitude), radiant, shower <b>identification,</b> <b>light</b> curve (meteor absolute magnitude as a function of time), photometric mass, orbital elements, and Tisserand parameter. Radiant/orbital plots and various histograms (number versus speed, time, etc) are also produced. After more than four years of operation, over 5, 000 multi-station fireballs have been observed, 3 of which potentially dropped meteorites. A database containing data on all these events, including the videos and calibration information, has been developed and is being modified to include data from the SOMN and other camera networks...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of project N 170 l, {{commissioned}} by MAFF from October 1990 until March 1992. The principle aims of the project, {{at a time when}} statutory changes involving strict labelling rules were anticipated, were to consolidate the thermoluminescence technique already developed at SURRC and to investigate it's extension to fruits and vegetables. The TL procedures for mineral separation were further developed by the incorporation of pre-concentration steps. These steps were introduced in order to improve the the sensitivity of the TL signal, particularly, where the separation technique resulted in low mineral yield for commercially clean samples. This has resulted in an order of magnitude increase in the absolute, TL, signal levels and provides a means of obtaining larger quantities of minerals for any further quantification, thus reducing the ambiguity of interpretation of data. An EC interlaboratory trial was instigated, using the full mineral separation method with reirradiation on a set of calibrated reference materials and paired (irradiated and unirradiated) samples of 12 commercial grade herbs and spices. Despite the diversity of experience and equipment employed, results from all laboratories showed {{that it was possible to}} determine which samples were irradiated. This demonstrated the strength of the separation method that its implementation could be successfully achieved in other laboratories. The procedure was then formally recognised and published, by MAFF, for detection of irradiated food for enforcement of UK legislation. As the mineral debris responsible for TL in herbs and spices occurs ubiquitously on all foodstuffs, which have been exposed to wind and soil, investigating the application of TL to fruits and vegetables was a natural extension of the previous work. An extensive survey was conducted of TL signals from fruits and vegetables, including exotic varieties. Minerals were separated from duplicated pairs of irradiated and unirradiated samples of 22 fruits and 20 vegetables. TL results demonstrated unambiguous discrimination between irradiated and unirradiated vegetables provided that concordance diagrams were used. For soft fruits in particular water based separation produced more variable results. However, subsequent analyses using a full density separation with HCI wash were more successful. It was recognised that whereas herbs and spices are largely protected from exposure to light during production and distribution, this is unlikely to be the case for fruits and vegtables. Since light exposure is known to reduce TL signal intensity, a set of illumination experiments was conducted to investigate the implications of optical bleaching for <b>identification.</b> <b>Light</b> boxes were constructed and characterised to simulated optical bleaching under controlled conditions. Two series of experiments were conducted with irradiated and control mangos. In the first experiment the effects of exposure to two different light sources at a level of 1 J cm- 2 were investigated using 40 mangos. In the second experiment the influence of duration of exposure from 1 - 128 J cm- 2 was examined for artificial daylight illumination of a further 96 mangos. The results of these studies show that although the TL signal is reduced as a result of exposure to daylight, there exists a residual unbleachable component comprising upto 40 - 50...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the optimal spectral bands for the <b>identification</b> of <b>lighting</b> types and {{the estimation of}} four major indices {{used to measure the}} efficiency or character of lighting. To accomplish these objectives we collected high-resolution emission spectra (350 to 2, 500 nm) for forty-three different lamps, encompassing nine of the major types of lamps used worldwide. The narrow band emission spectra were used to simulate radiances in eight spectral bands including the human eye photoreceptor bands (photopic, scotopic, and âmeltopicâ) plus five spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared modeled on bands flown on the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM). The high-resolution continuous spectra are superior to the broad band combinations for the <b>identification</b> of <b>lighting</b> type and are the standard for calculation of Luminous Efficacy of Radiation (LER), Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) and Color Rendering Index (CRI). Given the high cost that would be associated with building and flying a hyperspectral sensor with detection limits low enough to observe nighttime lights we conclude that it would be more feasible to fly an instrument with a limited number of broad spectral bands in the visible to near infrared. The best set of broad spectral bands among those tested is blue, green, red and NIR bands modeled on the band set flown on the Landsat Thematic Mapper. This set provides low errors on the <b>identification</b> of <b>lighting</b> types and reasonable estimates of LER and CCT when compared to the other broad band set tested. None of the broad band sets tested could make reasonable estimates of Luminous Efficacy (LE) or CRI. The photopic band proved useful for the estimation of LER. However, the three photoreceptor bands performed poorly in the <b>identification</b> of <b>lighting</b> types when compared to the bands modeled on the Landsat Thematic Mapper.

40|$|Light verbs pose an a {{challenge}} in linguistics because of its syntactic and semantic versatility and its unique distribution different from regular verbs with higher semantic content and selectional resrictions.

Recently, however, classification and <b>identification</b> of <b>light</b> verbs and light verb construction have become a focus of study in computational linguistics, especially {{in the context of}} multi-word expression, information retrieval, disambiguation, and parsing. Past linguistic and computational studies on light verbs had very different foci. Linguistic studies tend to focus on the sta-tus of light verbs and its various selectional constraints. While NLP studies have focused on light verbs in the context of either a multi-word expression (MWE) or a construction to be identified, classified, or translated, trying to overcome the apparent poverty of semantic content of light verbs. There has been nearly no work attempting to bridge these two lines of research. This paper takes this challenge by pro-posing a corpus-bases study which classifies and captures syntactic-semantic difference among all light verbs. In this study, we first incorporate results from past linguistic studies to create annotated light verb corpora with syntactic-semantics features. We next adopt a statistic method for automatic <b>identification</b> of <b>light</b> verbs based on this annotated corpora.
