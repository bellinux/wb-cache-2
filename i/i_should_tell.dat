500|$|The seven-track live {{record was}} {{recorded}} {{in front of a}} room full of people in New York City in the autumn of 1984. It has been rumored that the crowd noise was added in a studio rather than recorded on stage. Joel McIver, author of The Bloody Reign of Slayer, asked Live Undead producer/engineer Bill Metoyer, who had worked on the album in Los Angeles. Metoyer responded: [...] "I don't know if <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> you ! Isn't that one of those great industry secrets? Let's just say that when you're doing a live record, you want live sound — even if perhaps the microphones didn't pick up the audience properly." ...|$|E
500|$|Live Undead is {{the first}} live album by American thrash metal band Slayer. It was {{released}} through Metal Blade Records and recorded in New York City {{in front of a}} room of people. It has been questioned by both critics and authors that the audience sound {{may or may not be}} faked. However, in 1984, WBAB Fingers Metal Shop, a radio station, held a contest to meet and hang out with Slayer during a live recording. The album was recorded at Tiki Recording Studios in Glen Cove, NY in front of around a dozen people. The album was originally intended to be recorded in front of a live audience, but things went wrong. Nevertheless, when asked if they were fake, producer Bill Metoyer said, [...] "I don't know if <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> you." [...] The album begins with an extended introduction of [...] "Black Magic", followed by a small speech. The remaining tracks include both those of 1983's Show No Mercy and 1984's Haunting the Chapel. Ned Raggett of AllMusic gave the album two and a half out of five stars, and noted that it [...] "isn't really necessary except for the hardest of hardcore fans.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{defendants}} {{were taken into}} the back holding area of the court house with their lawyers {{for the last time}} before being transferred to the correctional center, they had some Italian food and a bottle of wine brought in for their last meal before going to prison. They all ate the food and toasted each other one last time with Lucchese family boss Anthony Corallo giving the traditional Italian toast of [...] "Cent'anni". This literally translates to [...] "100 years", and means [...] "may we live 100 years". Lucchese Family underboss Salvatore Santoro answered his boss with [...] "I think it's time to get a new toast", which prompted laughter {{from the rest of the}} mobsters. Genovese boss Anthony Salerno replied [...] "Maybe <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> em where the five million is buried".|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{may well}} ponder it," [...] said he. [...] "It {{is an easy}} matter to <b>tell</b> me what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> do. <b>Tell</b> me, rather, {{how it should be}} done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't see why <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>tell</b> you, mother, {{that there}} is a charming little woman--the very best woman in the world--who has {{expressed}} herself willing to--you understand?" ...|$|R
