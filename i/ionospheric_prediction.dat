NNs were trained with daily hourly values of M(3000) F 2 from various ionospheric stations spanning the period 1964 – 1986 with the following temporal and spatial input parameters: Universal Time, geographic latitude, magnetic inclination, magnetic declination, solar zenith angle, day of the year, A 16 index (a 2 -day running mean of the 3 -h planetary magnetic ap index), R 2 index (a 2 -month running mean of sunspot number), and the angle of meridian relative to the subsolar point. The performance of the NNs was verified by comparing the predicted values of M(3000) F 2 with observed values from a few selected ionospheric stations and the IRI (International Reference Ionosphere) model (CCIR M(3000) F 2 model) predicted values.

40|$|Ionospheric storms {{can have}} {{important}} effects on radio communications and navigation systems. Storm time <b>ionospheric</b> <b>predictions</b> {{have the potential}} to form part of effective mitigation strategies to these problems. Ionospheric storms are caused by strong forcing from the solar wind. Electron density enhancements are driven by penetration electric fields, as well as by thermosphere-ionosphere behavior including Traveling Atmospheric Disturbances and Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances and changes to the neutral composition. This study assesses the effect on 1 h predictions of specifying initial ionospheric and thermospheric conditions using total electron content (TEC) observations under a fixed set of solar and high-latitude drivers. Prediction performance is assessed against TEC observations, incoherent scatter radar, and in situ electron density observations. Corotated TEC data provide a benchmark of forecast accuracy. The primary case study is the storm of 10 September 2005, while the anomalous storm of 21 January 2005 provides a secondary comparison. The study uses an ensemble Kalman filter constructed with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed and the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model. Maps of preprocessed, verticalized GPS TEC are assimilated, while high-latitude specifications from the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics and solar flux observations from the Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Experiment are used to drive the model. The filter adjusts ionospheric and thermospheric parameters, making use of time-evolving covariance estimates. The approach is effective in correcting model biases but does not capture all the behavior of the storms. In particular, a ridge-like enhancement over the continental USA is not predicted, indicating the importance of predicting storm time electric field behavior to the problem of ionospheric forecasting...|$|R
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{high accuracy}} of modern HF direction finders cannot be realized in practice {{due to the}} perturbations and tilts which exist in the ionosphere. Particular attention is given in this dissertation {{to the effect of}} Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs) since their occurrence is difficult to predict and the magnitude of the induced bearing error extremely variable. TID activity is quantified by monitoring simultaneously the bearings of a number of transmitters whose locations and frequencies are well known. This information is then employed to determine the expected bearing error on a target transmission reflected in the same area of the ionosphere. The major limitations of this correction scheme are investigated. The large-scale temporal and spatial variations of the quiet ionosphere (Systematic Ionospheric Tilts, SITs) produce bearing errors of similar magnitude to those due to TIDs. Rapid calculation of these errors for various path geometries and ionospheric conditions is possible by raytracing through 3 -D ionospheric models. The limitations of a correction scheme which employs a 3 -D model based on <b>ionospheric</b> <b>predictions</b> are examined. Variance is a particularly useful statistic in assessing the 'reliability' of bearings made on a particular HF circuit. A scheme is proposed in which the bearings of a network of reference transmitters are monitored continuously allowing a variance to be assigned to any target transmission, even if it is only present for a very short time. These variance values are of considerable value in practical DF applications. Whenever possible the experimental observations are related to the underlying physical processes in the ionosphere which generate these DF errors...|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper is {{directed}} to the investigation of the practical importance of possible long-term trends in the F 2 -layer for <b>ionospheric</b> <b>prediction</b> models. Using observations of about 50 different ionosonde stations with more than 30 years data series of foF 2 and hmF 2, trends have been derived with the solar sunspot number R 12 as index of the solar activity. The final result of this trend analysis is that the differences between the trends derived from the data of the individual stations are relatively large, the calculated global mean values of the foF 2 and hmF 2 trends, however, are relatively small. There-fore, these small global trends can be neglected for practical purposes and must not be considered in <b>ionospheric</b> <b>prediction</b> models. This conclusion is in agreement with the results of other investigations analyzing data of globally distributed stations. As shown with the data of the ionosonde station Trom-sø, however, at individual stations the ionospheric trends may be markedly stronger and lead to essen-tial effects in ionospheric radio propagation.

30|$|The meridional GRBR {{network in}} Thailand–Indonesia {{was used to}} clarify the precise {{asymmetric}} structure of EIA. EIA asymmetry was successfully captured at the March equinox, when symmetric EIA was expected. From 1  month of data, 97 passes in March 2012, we successfully showed the day-to-day variability of EIA. Daily variation of the TEC values and {{the locations of the}} EIA crests along longitude ~ 100 ° E was precisely observed. North/south asymmetries were found at both daytime and nighttime. In daytime, the EIA strength variability was found to be proportional to the enhanced penetrating electric field associated with magnetospheric activity. Rapid evolution of EIA asymmetry during daytime was seen on geomagnetic disturbed days, although the penetrating electric field could not have formed the asymmetry. Instead, when neutral wind forces on the intense EIA exist during the penetrating electric field enhancement, it produces severe asymmetry of the EIA with respect to the high background TEC. Such rapid evolution of EIA asymmetry was not seen during nighttime. Meridional wind mainly controlled the asymmetric structures at nighttime. We found direct variation between the speed of the thermospheric northward (southward) wind and reduction of the TEC value in the northern (southern) hemisphere, which is evidence of an influence from the bottom-side ionosphere. Local operation of the GRBR network improves the dataset of precise temporal change of EIA asymmetry, which leads to an improvement of capability for <b>ionospheric</b> <b>prediction</b> (Watthanasangmechai et al. 2010, 2012) in Southeast Asia.

HF skywave operators plan frequency schedules months in advance, however, they also require daily {{knowledge of the}} ionospheric conditions in order to modify assignments. SATCOM operators also require daily information about the levels of scintillation, which are variations in phase, amplitude, polarisation and angle of arrival that can cause severe degradation of the received signal. Using a number of ionosonde measurements and geomagnetic and solar values, a Daily Ionospheric Forecasting Service (DIFS) has been developed, which provides HF and SATCOM operators with daily forecasts of predicted ionospheric conditions. The system uses in-house algorithms and an externally developed Global Ionospheric Scintillation Model (GISM) to generate HF and SATCOM forecasts. HF forecasts consist of a past summary and a forecast section, primarily displaying observed values and predicted categories for the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), {{as well as an}} Ionospheric Correction factor (ICF) that can be fed into the <b>ionospheric</b> propagation <b>prediction</b> tool, WinHF. SATCOM forecasts give predictions of global scintillation levels, for the polar, mid and equatorial latitude regions. Thorough analysis was carried out on DIFS and the results conclude that the service gives good accuracy, with user feedback also confirming this, as well...|$|R
40|$|Since 2004 DLR Neustrelitz {{operates}} the Space Weather Application Center – Ionosphere (SWACI). This Center {{is involved in}} several projects of the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) program of ESA and of EU FP 7. It is largely based on services and tools of DLR’s Data and Information Management System (DIMS) and its long-standing User interface EoWEB. SWACI provides access to near real time products and ensures long-term preservation. The lecture will analyze the existing solution and various project-specific applications and will derive requirements for a recent user interface. In the second part the talk will draw a design of an user interface for the <b>Ionospheric</b> Monitoring and <b>Prediction</b> Center (IMPC), which continues utilizing existing services of DLR, offers OGC compliant interfaces and which is so generalized that future projects can be easily plugged in...|$|R
