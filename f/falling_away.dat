25|$|The {{point of}} release is the {{position}} of the ball in relation to the body at the moment when the ball is released. It is crucial for the arm to be stiff, not bent, and the wrist rather looser, to ensure smooth release of the ball, and sufficient bounce off the pitch. Otherwise, the action will resemble chucking.

The missile has two stages, a large booster stage with four folding fins, which boosts the missile to a velocity of 900m/s, before <b>falling</b> <b>away.</b> The second stage has four fixed fins, and four steerable control surfaces. The complete missile is around 2.56 meters long with a weight of 57kg.|$|E

25|$|UFOIC's start was {{overshadowed by}} a large, more active Sydney group, the Northern Suburbs Flying Saucer Research Association. The two Sydney groups competed for members {{and soon the}} {{relationship}} between the two broke down. NSFSRA became the central NSW group, primarily due to their public support and hosting of George Adamski on his 1959 Australian visit, organised by Victorian and Queensland Groups. Adamski held his Sydney lecture at Adyar Hall on 27 February 1959. Adamski's visit resulted in UFOIC membership <b>falling</b> <b>away</b> dramatically until it was basically a small, close-knit group of enthusiasts. So bitter was the dispute, UFOIC President Dr. Greenwell resigned in disgust; this opened the position to Dr Miran Lindtner who became president in March 1959. The damage had been done and the Sydney experience scared the NSW UFO community.|$|E

In his first season at the Gay Meadow Rowley led Shrewsbury to {{promotion}} with a haul of 38 goals in 43 games, winning the Fourth Division golden boot. He followed that up in the Third Division as he continued scoring prolifically, netting 32, 28, 23 and 24 times {{over the next four}} seasons, before <b>falling</b> <b>away</b> in his last couple of seasons with the club as he began to put on weight and became less mobile, but his influence on the pitch was still to be seen, even employing himself as a makeshift defender on occasion, before finally retiring in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Ben Oss is {{especially}} craggy on its northern face, <b>falling</b> <b>away</b> steeply to the Cononish valley and barring any direct approach from this direction. It has two main ridges which {{connect to the}} adjacent Munros of Ben Lui and Beinn Dubhchraig and walkers usually arrive at the mountains summit along either of these. One ridge goes north east, east and then south east to form a curving edge around Coire Garbh connecting to Beinn Dubhchraig at the Bealach Buidhe with a height of 779 metres. Coire Garbh has Loch Oss lying within its recesses, {{a body of water}} measuring roughly 500 by 300 metres. Coire Buidhe stands on the northern side of this eastern ridge, this has a steep headwall and descents north from the bealach to the Cononish valley are not recommended.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the plot}} twists are {{the death of}} {{apparently}} crucial characters and the reappearances of believed-to-be dead characters. However, Rachael Brown of The Atlantic said that Martin's penchant for unpredictability may make the reader grow increasingly skeptical of apparent deaths, alluding to Jon Snow's fate in A Dance with Dragons. Martin believes that bringing back a dead character necessitates a transformative experience of the character. The body may be moving, but {{some aspect of the}} spirit is changed or lost. One of the characters who has come back repeatedly from death is Beric Dondarrion, The Lightning Lord, and what has happened with him echoes with some of the other revived characters; bits of his humanity and his past lives are lost every time he comes back from death, his flesh is <b>falling</b> <b>away</b> from him, but he remembers the mission he was sent to do before death.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{chairmanship}} of Matt Ridley, Northern Rock had a business plan which involved borrowing heavily in the UK and international money markets, extending mortgages to customers based on this funding, and then re-selling these mortgages on international capital markets, {{a process known as}} securitisation. In August 2007, when the global demand from investors for securitised mortgages was <b>falling</b> <b>away,</b> the lack of money raised by this meant that Northern Rock became unable to repay loans from the money market. This problem had been anticipated by the financial markets, which drew greater attention to it. On 14 September 2007, the bank sought and received a liquidity support facility from the Bank of England, to replace funds it was unable to raise from the money market. This led to panic among individual depositors, who feared that their savings might not be available should Northern Rock go into receivership. The result was a bank run – the UK's first in 150 years – where depositors lined up outside the bank to withdraw all of their savings as quickly as possible, particularly since everyone else was doing the same.|$|E
500|$|The {{fundamental}} idea of [...] "restoration" [...] or [...] "Christian Primitivism" [...] is that problems or {{deficiencies in the}} church can be corrected by using the primitive church as a [...] "normative model." [...] The call for restoration is often justified {{on the basis of}} a [...] "falling away" [...] that corrupted the original purity of the church. [...] This <b>falling</b> <b>away</b> is identified with the development of Catholicism and denominationalism. [...] New Testament verses that discuss future apostasy (...) and heresy (e.g., , , [...] ) are understood to predict this <b>falling</b> <b>away.</b> [...] The logic of [...] "restoration" [...] could imply that the [...] "true" [...] church completely disappeared and thus lead towards exclusivism. [...] Another view of restoration is that the [...] "true Church ... has always existed by grace and not by human engineering" [...] (italics in the original). [...] In this view the goal is to [...] "help Christians realize the ideal of the church in the New Testament– to restore the church as conceived in the mind of Christ" [...] (italics in the original). [...] Early Restoration Movement leaders did not believe that the church had ceased to exist, but instead sought to reform and reunite the church. [...] A number of congregations' web sites explicitly state that the true church never disappeared. [...] The belief in a general <b>falling</b> <b>away</b> is not seen as inconsistent with the idea that a faithful remnant of the church never entirely disappeared. Some have attempted to trace this remnant through the intervening centuries between the New Testament and the beginning of the Restoration Movement in the early 1800s.|$|E
500|$|In 1899, as a 13-year-old schoolboy, Collins {{scored the}} highest ever {{recorded}} cricket score of 628 not out. This feat {{took place during}} a junior school house cricket match between Clarke's House and North Town House. Such matches were timeless, played to a finish however long they took. The match was played on an outfield off Guthrie Road, Bristol, now named Collins Piece. The ground had both a poor surface and a very unusual shape: it was very short (only [...] long), with a wall only [...] away forming the boundary on one side, while {{the other side was}} a gentle slope <b>falling</b> <b>away</b> towards the school sanatorium in the distance. The pitch occupied the central [...] of the narrow field, with the boundary only [...] behind each set of stumps. Hits to the long boundary, down the slope, had to be all-run, but the three short boundaries only counted for two runs.|$|E

500|$|On the {{breeding}} grounds, the male corn crake's advertising call is a loud, repetitive, grating krek krek normally delivered {{from a low}} perch with the bird's head and neck almost vertical and its bill wide open. The call can be heard from [...] away, and serves to establish {{the breeding}} territory, attract females, and challenge intruding males. Slight differences in vocalisations mean that individual males can be distinguished by their calls. Early in the season, the call is given almost continuously at night, and often during the day, too. It may be repeated more than 20,000 times a night, with a peak between midnight and 3am. The call has evolved to make a singing male's location clear, as this species hides in vegetation. The frequency of calling reduces {{after a few weeks}} but may intensify again {{near the end of the}} laying period before <b>falling</b> <b>away</b> towards the end of the breeding season. To attract males, mechanical imitations of their call can be produced by rubbing a piece of wood down a notched stick, or by flicking a credit card against a comb or zip-fastener. The male also has a growling call, given with the bill shut and used during aggressive interactions.|$|E
500|$|Augustine {{proposed}} that evil could not exist within God, nor {{be created by}} God, and is instead a by-product of God's creativity. He rejected the notion that evil exists in itself, proposing instead {{that it is a}} privation of (or <b>falling</b> <b>away</b> from) good, and a corruption of nature. He wrote that [...] "evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name 'evil.'" [...] Both moral and natural evil occurs, Augustine argued, owing to an evil use of free will, which could be traced back to Adam and Eve's original sin. He believed that this evil will, present in the human soul, was a corruption of the will given to humans by God, making suffering a just punishment for the sin of humans. Because Augustine believed that all of humanity was [...] "seminally present in the loins of Adam", he argued that all of humanity inherited Adam's sin and his just punishment. However, in spite of his belief that free will can be turned to evil, Augustine maintained that it is vital for humans to have free will, because they could not live well without it. He argued that evil could come from humans because, although humans contained no evil, they were also not perfectly good and hence could be corrupted.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced at Gibraltar on 17 September 1986. Aerial stuntmen B. J. Worth and Jake Lombard {{performed the}} pre-credits parachute jump. Both the terrain and wind were unfavourable. Consideration {{was given to}} the stunt being done using cranes but aerial stunts arranger B. J. Worth stuck to skydiving and completed the scenes in a day. The aircraft used for the jump was a C-130 Hercules, which in the film had M's office installed in the aircraft cabin. The initial point of view for the scene shows M in what appears to be his usual London office, but the camera then zooms out to reveal that it is, in fact, inside an aircraft. Although marked as a Royal Air Force aircraft, the one in shot belonged to the Spanish Air Force and was used again later in the film for the Afghanistan sequences, this time in [...] "Russian" [...] markings. During this later chapter, a fight breaks out on the open ramp of the aircraft in flight between Bond and Necros, before Necros falls to his death. Although the plot and preceding shots suggest the aircraft is a C-130, the shot of Necros <b>falling</b> <b>away</b> from the aircraft show a twin engine cargo plane, a C-123 Provider. Worth and Lombard also doubled for Bond and Necros in the scenes where they are hanging on a bag in a plane's open cargo door.|$|E
