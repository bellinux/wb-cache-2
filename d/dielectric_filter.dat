40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a method}} for locating within a scene a distribution of an absorbing gas using a passive imaging technique. An oscillatory modulation of the angle of a narrowband <b>dielectric</b> <b>filter</b> located {{in front of a}} camera imaging a scene, gives rise to an intensity modulation that differs in regions occupied by the absorbing gas. A preliminary low cost system has been constructed from readily available components which demonstrates how the location of gas within a scene can be implemented.

40|$|A {{radioisotope}} thermophotovoltaic generator space {{power system}} (RTPV) is lightweight, low-cost {{alternative to the}} present radioisotope thermoelectric generator system (RTG). The fabrication of such an RTPV generator has recently become feasible {{as the result of}} the invention of the GaSb infrared sensitive photovoltaic cell. Herein, we present the results of a parametric study of emitters and optical filters in conjuction with existing data on gallium antimonide cells. We compare a polished tungsten emitter with an Erbia selective emitter for use in combination with a simple <b>dielectric</b> <b>filter</b> and a gallium antimonide cell array. We find that the polished tungsten emitter is by itself a very selective emitter with low emissivity beyond 4 microns. Given a gallium antimonide cell and a tungsten emitter, a simple <b>dielectric</b> <b>filter</b> can be designed to transmit radiant energy below 1. 7 microns and to reflect radiant energy between 1. 7 and 4 microns back to the emitter. Because of the low long wavelength emissivity associated with the polished tungsten emitter, this simple <b>dielectric</b> <b>filter</b> then yields very respectable system performance. Also as a result of the longer wavelength fall-off in the tungsten emissivity curve, the radiation energy peak for a polished tungsten emitter operating at 1300 K shifts to shorter wavelengths relative to the blackbody spectrum so that the radiated energy peak falls right at the gallium antimonide cell bandedge. The result is that the response of the gallium antimonide cell is well matched to a polished tungsten emitter. We propose, therefore, to fabricate an operating prototype of a near term radioisotope thermophotovoltaic generator design consisting of a polished tungsten emitter, standard gallium antimonide cells, and a near-term <b>dielectric</b> <b>filter.</b> The Jet Propulsion Laboratory will design and build the thermal cavity, and JX Crystals will fabricate the gallium antimonide cells, dielectric filters, and resultant receiver panels. With 250 Watts of heat input, we expect this prototype to produce over 300 Watts of electrical energy output for a system energy conversion efficiency of over 12 %. This low risk, near term design provides advances relative to present radioisotope thermophotovoltaic generators and has the additional advantage of allowing component and system development and testing to begin immediately. Improved cells and filters can easily be incorporated in this baseline system if they should become available in the future...|$|E

These authors have suggested using a <b>dielectric</b> <b>filter</b> with a transmission wavelength of 550  nm and a full width at half maximum of 10  nm {{in front of the}} camera in order to eliminate the self-luminosity of the plasma and the background radiation.

ZnS, which is an important member of this family, has been extensively investigated as it has numerous applications to its credit. ZnS has been used widely as an important phosphor for photoluminescence, electroluminescence, and cathodoluminescence devices due to its better chemical stability compared to other chalcogenides such as ZnSe.

Interference filters were deposited directly on photoelectric cells, using a low temperature coating procedure. The spectral sensitivity of the photoelectric cells was modified according to the application requirements; losses due to absorption and scattered light were minimized. The geometric shape of the receiver cells was chosen to be adaptable to concentric micro-optical components making efficient use of the available sensitive area. For a local resolving color sensor, 19 identical hexagons each consisting of three different filters formed like rhombi have been arranged on one glass substrate.

In this paper, {{we describe the}} design and fabrication of broadband multichroic filters that have a sinusoidal transmission spectra to utilize a novel methodology based on the Fourier spectral reconstruction in the frequency domain. Since the spectral filters are posed as an optimal sampling of hyperspectral images, they also allow for {{the reconstruction of the}} full spectrum from subsequent demosaicking algorithms. Unlike conventional Color Filter Arrays (CFA) which utilizes absorption dyes embedded in a polymeric material, the sinusoidal multichroic filters require an all-dielectric interference filter design. However, the goal of most <b>dielectric</b> <b>filter</b> designs is to achieve sharp transitions with high-contrast. A smoothly varying sinusoidal transition is more difficult with conventional approaches. However, this can be achieved by trading off the contrast. Following the principles of a simple Fabry-Perot cavity, we have designed and built interference filters from 0. 5 sinusoidal periods to 3 sinusoidal periods from 450 nm to 900 nm spectral range. Also, in order to maintain a uniform period across the entire spectrum, the material must have a very low dispersion. In this design, we have used ZnS as the cavity material.
