5|$|In {{conjunction}} with developers and publishers, Valve frequently provides discounted sales on games {{on a daily}} and weekly basis, sometimes oriented around a publisher, genre, or holiday theme, and sometimes allow games to be tried for free during the days of these sales. The site normally offers a large selection of games at discount during its annual Summer and Holiday sales, including <b>gamification</b> of these sales to incentive users to purchase more games.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of a {{controversial}} speech by Zynga's president at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2010, Bogost developed Cow Clicker for a presentation at a New York University seminar on social gaming in July 2010. The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of social games, such as the promotion of social interaction and monetization rather than the artistic aspects of the medium. As the game unexpectedly began to grow in popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming trends, such as <b>gamification,</b> educational apps, and alternate reality games.|$|E
5|$|Qapital is a {{personal}} finance mobile application (app) for the iOS and Android operating systems, developed by Qapital Inc. The app is designed to motivate users to save money through a <b>gamification</b> of their spending behavior. It moves money from a user's checking account to a separate Qapital account, when certain rules are triggered. Its database is used by psychology professor Dan Ariely to study consumer behavior. Qapital was released in Sweden in 2013, then in the US in early 2015. The application was later withdrawn from the Swedish market in April 2015, in order {{to focus on the}} US market.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} digital tools, online or mobile apps, have been {{introduced}} {{that are designed to}} support habit formation. For example, Habitica is a system that uses <b>gamification,</b> implementing strategies found in video games to real life tasks by adding rewards such as experience and gold. A review of such tools, however, suggests most are poorly designed with respect to theory and fail to support the development of automaticity.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{researchers}} {{thought of}} motivations to use computer systems to be primarily driven by extrinsic purposes; however, many modern systems have their use driven primarily by intrinsic motivations. Examples of such systems used primarily to fulfil users' intrinsic motivations, include on-line gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, gamified systems, and general <b>gamification.</b> Even traditional management information systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) are being 'gamified' such that both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations must increasingly be considered.|$|E
25|$|Motivational {{models are}} central to game design, because without motivation, a player will not be {{interested}} in progressing further within a game. Several models for gameplay motivations have been proposed, including Richard Bartle's. Jon Radoff has proposed a four-quadrant model of gameplay motivation that includes cooperation, competition, immersion and achievement. The motivational structure of games {{is central to the}} <b>gamification</b> trend, which seeks to apply game-based motivation to business applications. In the end, game designers must know the needs and desires of their customers for their companies to flourish.|$|E
25|$|Richard Bartle, {{author of}} Designing Virtual Worlds, {{classified}} multiplayer RPG-players into four primary psychological groups. His classifications were then expanded upon by Erwin Andreasen, {{who developed the}} concept into the thirty-question Bartle Test that helps players determine which category they are associated with. With over 650,000 test responses as of 2011, {{this is perhaps the}} largest ongoing survey of multiplayer game players. Based on Bartle and Yee's research, Jon Radoff has published an updated model of player motivation that focuses on immersion, competition, cooperation and achievement. These elements may be found not only in MMORPGs, but many other types of games and within the emerging field of <b>gamification.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Zichermann {{reports that}} he gravitated towards using game {{mechanics}} professionally with games like Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? and Civilization. In his speeches at TED he argues that not only can <b>gamification</b> be exploited by business but it also can be utilized in education as a serious game to teach students that are not otherwise engaged with traditional classrooms. He points to [...] educationalist Anant Pai's work with an elementary school in White Bear Lake, Minnesota as well as University of Washington's Foldit program. He counters {{the argument that the}} immersive environment of video games don't teach the right kind of attention by pointing to the concept of fluid intelligence. Zichermann believes the intense mental engagement of video games is tied to the dopamine released in game participants as the players receive rewards in game. [...] Zichermann also refutes the idea that <b>gamification</b> is necessarily pernicious or simply a fad by pointing to the positive results of <b>gamification</b> applied outside of the entertainment industry, although he has acknowledged that a dark side does exist to this technology. He also posits that <b>gamification</b> could be taken to online banking, charitable organizations, or any other industry. A system of rewards could encourage members of a gym to attend regularly.|$|E

[...] He opines that increasing the degree of game mechanics through funware in work production will become even more effective on the millennial generation raised with video games and seek to stay in a game environment at the workplace. He has criticized current location-based applications like Foursquare as lacking enough social element as well as being too complicated for users to remain engaged.|$|E

50|$|Teachers who {{criticize the}} <b>gamification</b> of {{learning}} might {{feel that it}} is not worth their time to implement gaming initiatives, either because they themselves are stretched thin with the number of responsibilities that they already have, or because they fear that the curriculum might not be covered if any time is spent dedicated to anything other than engagement with that curriculum. <b>Gamification</b> of learning has been also criticized as ineffective for certain learners and for certain situations. It should be noted that proponents of <b>gamification</b> have never claimed that <b>gamification</b> is such a panacea, recognizing that it is not an appropriate strategy to motivate every learner in every circumstance. Videogame theorist Ian Bogost has criticized <b>gamification</b> for its tendency to take a simplistic, manipulative approach which does not reflect the real quality of complex, motivational games.
