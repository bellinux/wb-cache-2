50|$|A <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner</b> is any {{ingredient}} {{or chemical}} added to bread dough {{to strengthen its}} texture or otherwise improve it in some way. Dough conditioners may include enzymes, yeast nutrients, mineral salts, oxidants and reductants, and emulsifiers.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{it is the}} key {{ingredient}} in the <b>dough</b> <b>conditioners</b> s500 and us500 manufactured by Puratos. These enzymes are used to improve the dough's workability and absorption of water.|$|R
50|$|Examples of <b>dough</b> <b>conditioners</b> include ascorbic acid, {{distilled}} monoglycerides, citrate ester of monoglycerides, diglycerides, ammonium chloride, enzymes, diacetyl {{tartaric acid}} ester of monoglycerides or DATEM, potassium bromate, calcium salts such as calcium iodate, L-cystine, azodicarbonamide, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sucrose palmitate or sucrose ester, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate or polysorbate, soybean lecithin, and soybean lecithin enriched with lysophospholipids.|$|R
50|$|Less {{processed}} <b>dough</b> <b>conditioners</b> include sprouted- or malted-grain flours, soy, milk, wheat germ, potatoes, gluten, yeast, {{and extra}} kneading. Malted, diastatic flours are not typically added by manufacturers to whole-wheat flours. Robertson et al. {{point out that}} some of the better information is found in baking books published back when bakers were still kneading by hand.|$|R
5000|$|Sodium stearyl fumarate {{is a form}} of fumaric acid, {{acting as}} a <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner,</b> oxidant and wheat flour {{treatment}} agent in yeast-fermented products [...] In Canada, SSF is permitted to use in bread or other unstandardized bakery products within a certain amount of flour.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., the use {{of iodine}} has {{decreased}} over concerns of overdoses since mid-20th century, and the iodine antagonists bromine, perchlorate and fluoride have become more ubiquitous. In particular, around 1980 the practice of using potassium iodate as <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner</b> in bread and baked goods was gradually replaced by {{the use of}} other conditioning agents such as bromide.|$|E
5000|$|Chlorine dioxide is a {{water soluble}} {{chemical}} compound used as predominantly used in bleach. Bleaching agents make the flour appear whiter, {{as well as}} oxidize the surfaces of the flour grains {{to help with the}} development of gluten. Chlorine Dioxide can also be used as a <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner</b> which can help make the dough firm and decrease mixing time.  Using Chlorine Dioxide in baking can improve the texture, size and surface smoothness of bakery goods.(L-cysteine hydrochloride is a non-essential amino acid formed by the body and is used in the baking industry as a <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner.</b> This chemical compound breaks the bonds of gluten to lower the viscosity, which enhances the dough rising process during baking. This additive also helps to keep the doughs shape by preventing shrinkage during freezing. L-cysteine is a non-essential amino acid that the human body can obtain by converting the essential amino acid methionine.  It is commonly sold as a <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner</b> in the form of L-cysteine hydrochloride. In bread, flour and whole wheat flour, 90 p.p.m. of L-cysteine hydrochloride is allowed for using in Canada.  In unstandardized bakery products, Good Manufacturing Practice is followed.  In baking, L-cysteine hydrochloride acts by disrupting the gluten disulfide bonds, which reduces the viscosity of the dough and therefore makes it easier to work the dough and helps the dough to rise while giving it more elasticity.  In addition, L-cysteine keeps dough shape and prevents shrinkage during dough freezing.|$|E
2500|$|One study {{reported}} a [...] "potential danger of [...] deficiency disorders due to strict forms of vegetarian nutrition, especially when {{fruits and vegetables}} grown in soils with low [...] levels are ingested." [...] Iodine, however, is usually supplied by iodized salt and other sources in first world countries. Other significant sources of iodine include sea vegetables (seaweed) and bread made with <b>dough</b> <b>conditioners.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bread {{improvers}} and <b>dough</b> <b>conditioners</b> {{are often}} used in producing commercial breads to reduce the time needed for rising and to improve texture and volume. The substances used may be oxidising agents to strengthen the dough or reducing agents to develop gluten and reduce mixing time, emulsifiers to strengthen the dough or to provide other properties such as making slicing easier, or enzymes to increase gas production.|$|R
50|$|Leavened or {{fermented}} doughs (generally {{made from}} grain cereals or legumes that are ground to produce flour, mixed {{with water and}} yeast) are used {{all over the world}} to make various breads. Salt, oils or fats, sugars or honey and sometimes milk or eggs are also common ingredients in bread dough. Commercial bread doughs may also include <b>dough</b> <b>conditioners,</b> a class of ingredients that aid in dough consistency and final product.|$|R
5000|$|As a food additive, azodicarbonamide {{is used as}} a flour {{bleaching}} agent and a <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner.</b> [...] It reacts with moist flour as an oxidizing agent. The main reaction product is biurea, a derivative of urea, which is stable during baking. Secondary reaction products include semicarbazide and ethyl carbamate. It is known by the E number E927. Many restaurants in the US fast food industry removed the additive in response to negative publicity.|$|E
50|$|Lecithin, monoglycerides, diglycerides, and DATEM are {{considered}} emulsifiers. They disperse fat more evenly throughout the dough, helping it to trap {{more of the}} CO2 produced by yeast. Lecithin added {{at a rate of}} 0.25-to-0.6% of the flour weight acts as a <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner.</b> Based on total weight, egg yolk contains about 9% lecithin. Monoglycerides and diglycerides replace eggs in baked goods. Emulsifiers tend to produce a finer grain, softer crumb, and with longer proof times, increased baked volume.|$|E
5000|$|A notable {{exception}} is the United States of America, where azodicarbonamide has a {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS) status and is allowed to be added to flour at levels up to 45 ppm. However, use in products intended for human consumption is in decline under pressure of the public opinion. In 2014, amid public discomfort with the dual uses of azodicarbonamide, the sandwich franchise Subway and hamburger franchise Wendy's announced that they would no longer use it as a <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner.</b> Currently, the Center for Science in the Public Interest stated azodicarbonamide [...] "has been poorly tested" [...] and advocates for reducing the amount of azodicarbonamide that is allowed to be used in food.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1900s it was {{discovered}} the use of calcium chlorid sic, ammonium sulfate, and potassium bromate halved the amount of yeast needed to raise dough. These mixtures were generally known as mineral yeast foods or yeast nutrient salts. After they became popular among bakers, one patented yeast food was analyzed by Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station chief chemist J.P. Street who published in 1917 that it contained, [...] "calcium sulphate, 25; ammonium chlorid, 9.7; potassium bromate, 0.3; sodium chlorid, 25; patent wheat flour, 40." [...] They contain water conditioners, yeast <b>conditioners,</b> and <b>dough</b> <b>conditioners.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Flour {{treatment}} agents (also called improving agents, bread improvers, <b>dough</b> <b>conditioners</b> and <b>dough</b> improvers) are {{food additives}} combined with flour to improve baking functionality. Flour treatment agents {{are used to}} increase the speed of dough rising and to improve the strength and workability of the dough. While they are an important component of modern factory baking, some small-scale bakers reject them in favour of longer fermentation periods that produce greater depth of flavour.There are wide ranges of these conditioners used in factory baking, which fall into four main categories: bleaching agents, oxidizing and reducing agents, enzymes, and emulsifiers. These agents are often sold as mixtures in a soy flour base, as only small amounts are required.|$|R
40|$|Wholemeal {{products}} of einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum L.) could help {{to elevate the}} daily uptake of both dietary fibre and lutein, compounds which can assist the prevention of coronary heart disease and age-related macular degeneration, respectively. However, gluten strength and rheological properties of einkorn wheat are low and bran particles are reported to decrease bread volume and crumb elasticity of flours. It was demonstrated that the application of individual enzymes and/or emulsifiers or their application in mixtures can significantly improve bread volume and crumb firmness of whole-grain einkorn breads. Crumb porosity characteristics, however, were not affected. Synergistic interactions between the dough improvers can be supposed. The antithesis between the application of <b>dough</b> <b>conditioners</b> and the organic production of einkorn wheat, and optional methods for optimisation of whole-grain einkorn bread are discussed...|$|R
50|$|In February 2014, Hari {{launched}} a petition on her website asking Subway to remove azodicarbonamide (a safe flour bleaching agent and <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner)</b> from their sandwich bread. The petition gathered more than 50,000 signatures in 24 hours. Subway later announced {{a plan to}} remove the ingredient from all of their sandwich breads, a process which began before her campaign. The Center For Science In The Public Interest, who advocates for its reduction, credited Hari for drawing attention to it. The Environmental Working Group supported the removal of azodicarbonamide and urge against its use. Food science experts {{have pointed out that}} the level of azodicarbonamide permitted by the FDA for use in bread is too low to pose a significant risk.|$|E

50|$|Bread machine {{recipes are}} often {{somewhat}} smaller than standard bread recipes, and are sometimes standardized {{based on the}} capacity of the machine's pan; most common in the United States market are 1.5 lb/700g units, and the majority of recipes are written for that capacity; however, 2 lb/900g units are not uncommon either. Packaged bread mixes are available, specifically designed for breadmakers, containing premeasured ingredients including flour and yeast, as well as flavorings and occasionally <b>dough</b> <b>conditioners.</b> Only water usually needs to be added. Bread machines generally do not deal well with non-wheat flours, so any recipe that requires a substantial addition of a grain such as rye or corn that lacks gluten will prove difficult at best in a bread machine, as will any dough with unusually large amounts of liquid (such as ciabatta).|$|R
40|$|Grains offer {{a variety}} of nutrients; it is thought that through the {{addition}} of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) the fiber and protein in baked products may be improved. In this study, all-purpose flour and bread flour were tested with various DDGS substitution levels (0 %, 25 %, or 50 % flour substitution) with the <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner</b> sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL) (0 %, 0. 15 %, or 0. 3 % flour weight basis). SSL is surfactant produced from reacting stearic acid with food grade lactic acid in the presence of sodium. Overall, as the substitution level of DDGS increased, so did protein, moisture, ash, and Hunter-a values. Peak height, side height, width, and length of baked loaves decreased as DDGS quantity increased, however. Baked bread containing SSL had enhanced quality, with increasing dough strength, rate of hydration, mixing tolerance, crumb strength, loaf volume, and shelf life. Overall, 25 - 50 % DDGS substitution appeared to {{have a negative effect on}} physical features despite the fact that the nutrient content was enhanced. Less than 25 % DDGS had minimal negative effects on bread properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{additive}} {{of acceptable}} sensory, {{physical and chemical}} and microbiological characteristics was made from cossettes. Great water binding capacity related to microcrystals of cellulose qualifies this additive as a desired one in bread making process. Bread was baked in the laboratory and patent flour was used. The additive with particles smaller than 95 (m was supplemented in the quantities of 2, 5 and 10 %. The data related {{to the influence of}} the quantity of additive on white bread quality point that parallel to increasing the amount of the additive in the dough, yield of dough and bread were also increased. Negative effects are detected as volume depression and inferior bread crumb quality and altered crumb color. The decrease in bread quality is small if 2 % of additive was applied, but significant with 5 and 10 %. The bread freshness was highly graded 48 hours after baking due to the ability of the additive to retain water. On the whole, bread of superior quality supplemented by 5 and 10 % of the additive from sugar beet fiber can be easily made by fortifying flour with gluten and by adding appropriate <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner...</b>|$|E
40|$|ADA) {{is widely}} used as a blowing agent in the {{manufacture}} of expanded foam plastics, as an aging and bleaching agent in flour, and as a bread <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner.</b> Human exposures have been reported during manufacture as well as during use. Groups of male F 344 /N rats were administered ADA by gavage, by intratracheal instillation, and by inhalation exposure to deter-mine the disposition and modes of excretion of ADA and its metabolites. At 72 hr following gavage, 30 % of the administered ADA was absorbed whereas following intratracheal instillation, absorption was 90 %. Comparison between groups of rats exposed by inhalation to ADA to achieve body burdens of 24 or 1230 n % showed no significant differences in modes or rates of excretion of [I 4 C]ADA equivalents. ADA was readily converted to biurea under physiological conditions and biurea was the only 14 C-labeled compound present in excreta. [I 4 C]ADA equiva-lents were present in all examined tissues immediately after inhalation exposure, and clearance half-times on the order of 1 day were evident for all tissues investigated. Storage depots for [I 4 C]ADA equivalents were not observed. The rate of buildup of [14 C]ADA equivalents in blood was linearly related to the lung content as measured from rats withdrawn at selected times during a 6 -hr inhalation exposure at an aerosol concentration of 25 ng, ADA/liter.

30|$|Due to {{the absence}} of water inclusions, DCPA is less soluble than DCPD (Table  1). Like DCPD, DCPA can be {{crystallized}} from aqueous solutions containing Ca/P ratio ~ 1 at solution pH within ~ 2.0  < pH < ~ 6.5 but at temperatures >~ 90  °C. In addition, DCPA might be prepared by dehydration of DCPD. Furthermore, it might be also prepared at ambient temperatures in water-restricted or non-aqueous systems, such as gels (Sivkumar et al. 1997), ethanol (Tas 2009), {{as well as in the}} oil-in-water and water-in-oil systems (Chen et al. 2005). DCPA is physically stable and resisted hydration even when dispersed in water for over 7  months in the temperature range of 4 – 50  °C (Miyazaki et al. 2009). A calcium-deficient DCPA was also prepared. It might be sintered at ~ 300  °C (Eshtiagh-Hosseini et al. 2008). Unlike DCPD, DCPA occurs in neither normal nor pathological calcifications. It is used in self-setting CaPO 4 formulations (Dorozhkin 2013 b). Besides, DCPA might be implanted as bioceramics (Tamimi et al. 2010). Other applications include using as a polishing agent, a source of calcium and phosphate in nutritional supplements (e.g., in prepared breakfast cereals, enriched flour and noodle products), a tableting aid (Takami et al. 1996) and a toothpaste component (Dorozhkin 2013 c). In addition, it is used as a <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner</b> in food industry (Budavari et al. 1996). DCPA of a technical grade of purity might be used as a fertilizer (Habashi 2011).|$|E
40|$|Recently doubts {{have arisen}} on the {{usefulness}} of semicarbazide as marker residue for the illegal use of the antibiotic nitrofurazone (NFZ) in aquaculture and poultry production. Most notably azodicarbonamide (ADC) has been implicated as an alternative source of semicarbazide. ADC is used in some countries as a <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner</b> at concentrations up to 45 mg kg¿ 1. The use of ADC-treated flour or dough in coated or breaded food products may generate false non-compliant results in the analytical method for nitrofurazone metabolites, which is currently in use. During the dough preparation process ADC is largely reduced to biurea, which {{can be considered as}} an appropriate marker residue of ADC. Thus far no methods have been published for the determination of biurea in food commodities. Due to its polar nature {{it is very difficult to}} generate sufficient retention on conventional C 18 HPLC columns. With a TSK amide HILIC type column good retention was obtained. A straightforward extraction-dilution protocol was developed. Using a mixture of dimethyl formamide and water biurea was nearly quantitatively extracted from a variety of fresh, coated and processed products. Mass spectrometric detection was performed with positive electrospray ionisation. The sensitivity and selectivity of the mass spectrometer for biurea was very good, allowing detection at concentrations as low as 10 ¿g kg¿ 1. However, in some extracts severe ion suppression effects was observed. To overcome the implications of ion suppression on the quantitative performance of the method an isotopically-labelled biurea internal standard was synthesized and incorporated in the method. The method developed can be used effectively in nitrofurazone analysis to eliminate the risk of false non-compliant results due to the presence of azodicarbonamide-treated components in the food product...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{detailed in}} this document focuses {{on the performance of}} a partially defatted soybean flour called low-fat soybean flour (LSF). This soybean flour type has not received widespread application as a food ingredient. This has resulted from a lack of information available on the performance of LSF in a variety of food systems. Based upon its compositional and functional properties, LSF has shown potential for use in a flour blend. Past studies have focused on the usage of flour blends containing wheat flour partially replaced by an oilseed or legume flour. Wheat-soy flour blends have mostly been studied for use in yeast-leavened bread production. These blends have been able to enhance the protein content of yeast-leavened breads; however, favorable and unfavorable alterations to dough and bread development have been observed. In an effort to determine whether LSF could make favorable contributions to bread systems when used in a flour blend with wheat, several studies were performed in comparison to blends of wheat and defatted soy flour (DSF). For all experiments, wheat flour was replaced by soybean flour up to 12 % based on weight and/or equivalent protein;To understand the protein-water interaction character of LSF in a flour blend, water-holding capacity (WHC) was examined. WHC was evaluated for blends at 2, 4, 6, and 12 % replacement of wheat flour based on weight and equivalent protein. Findings showed that wheat-LSF blends had very similar WHC character to wheat-DSF blends. Dough development testing using a 10 -g mixograph was performed on flour blends at the replacement levels of 2, 6, and 12 %. The parameters of mix (peak) time, rate of development, and shear force during development were quantified. Dough development testing was conducted with and without the use of the dough conditioners, sodium stearoyl-lactylate and calcium stearoyl- 2 -lactylate. Wheat-LSF blend required longer mixing; however, these mix times were decreased after <b>dough</b> <b>conditioner</b> use. Effects on the physical and sensory properties of yeast-leavened bread were evaluated after making bread using the specified wheat-soybean flour blends at 2, 6, and 12 % replacement of wheat flour. The physical properties loaf weight, loaf volume, crumb firmness, and crust/crumb color were evaluated. Sensory evaluation of bread crumb was accomplished using an 11 -member sensory panel. Panelists provided sensory perception data for the perceived intensity of the following bread attributes: bread aroma, nutty aroma, crumb firmness, bread flavor and nutty flavor. Nutty flavor was associated with breads that contained soybean flour. Overall wheat-LSF breads had similar physical and sensory properties to wheat bread that did not contain any soybean flour. Most results from this research have been attributed to the presence of approximately 10 % oil in the LSF...|$|E
