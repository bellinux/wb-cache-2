50|$|Electrochemical {{fluorination}} (ECF), or electrofluorination, is a foundational organofluorine chemistry {{method for}} {{the preparation of}} fluorocarbon-based organofluorine compounds. The general approach represents an application of electrosynthesis. The <b>fluorinated</b> <b>chemical</b> compounds produced by ECF are useful because of their distinctive solvation properties and the relative inertness of carbon-fluorine bonds. Two ECF synthesis routes are commercialized and commonly applied: the Simons process and the Phillips Petroleum process. It is also possible to electrofluorinate in various organic media. Prior {{to the development of}} these methods, fluorination with fluorine, a dangerous oxidant, was a dangerous and wasteful process. Also, ECF can be cost-effective but it may also result in low yields.|$|E
40|$|To {{develop a}} {{chemical}} shift encoding (CSE) approach for fluorine- 19 MRI of perfluorocarbons {{in the presence}} of multiple known <b>fluorinated</b> <b>chemical</b> species. A multi-echo CSE technique is applied for spectral separation of the perfluorocarbon perfluoro- 15 -crown- 5 -ether (PFCE) and isoflurane (ISO) based on their chemical shifts at 4. 7 [*]T. Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis is used to identify echo combinations with optimal signal-to-noise performance. Signal contributions are fit with a multispectral fluorine signal model using a non-linear least squares estimation reconstruction directly from k-space data. This CSE approach is tested in fluorine- 19 phantoms and in a mouse with a 2 D and 3 D spoiled gradient-echo acquisition using multiple echo times determined from Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis. Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis for PFCE and ISO separation shows signal-to-noise performance is maximized with a 0. 33 ms echo separation. A linear behavior (R(2) [*]=[*] 0. 987) between PFCE signal and known relative PFCE volume is observed in CSE reconstructed images using a mixed PFCE/ISO phantom. Effective spatial and spectral separation of PFCE and ISO is shown in phantoms and in vivo. Feasibility of a gradient-echo CSE acquisition and image reconstruction approach with optimized noise performance is demonstrated through fluorine- 19 MRI of PFCE with effective removal of ISO signal contributions.

The use of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and other perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in some AFFF formulations has been linked to substantial environmental contamination. Recent studies have identified a large number of novel and infrequently reported fluorinated surfactants in different AFFF formulations. In this study, a strategy based on a case-control approach using quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS/MS) and advanced statistical methods has been used to extract and identify known and unknown PFAS in human serum associated with AFFF-exposed firefighters.

The changes in chemical composition were investigated by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT) and UV/VIS spectroscopy.

Log K[subscript oc] values for perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), estimated from analysis of paired samples of groundwater and aquifer solids, indicated that solid/water partitioning was not entirely consistent with predictions based on laboratory studies. Differential PFAA transport was not strongly evident in the subsurface, likely due to remediation-induced conditions. When compared to the surface soil spatial distributions, the relative concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and PFAA precursors in groundwater strongly suggest that remedial activities altered the subsurface PFAS distribution, presumably through significant pumping of groundwater and transformation of precursors to PFAAs.

40|$|Estuarine and {{coastline}} {{ecosystems are}} of major economic importance, {{but due to}} large industrial and domestic waste water discharges, the structure and functions of these habitats are often disturbed. Like other estuarine areas, the Western Scheldt estuary, situated in the southwest of the Netherlands and the north of Belgium, is a highly polluted ecosystem. Until now attention was primarly focused on organochlorines, pesticides and heavy metals because of their persistent character and ability to accumulate in aquatic organisms. Research investigating another group of important pollutants, the fluorinated organic compounds (FOCs), has received much less attention. As recent {{studies have indicated that}} FOCs occur worldwide in the environment, show high persistence and little or no biodegradation, it becomes more and more important to characterize the distribution patterns and effects of fluorinated organochemicals.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from Aug. 2, 2012 - Feb. 2, 2013 It {{is the responsibility of}} humans, as environmental stewards, to monitor our impact on the environment so that efforts can be made to remediate the effects of our actions and change behaviors. To better understand our environmental footprint, sensitive and simple analytical methods are needed to quantify the contaminants that we discharge into our natural surroundings. Emerging environmental contaminants are of particular concern because there is limited or no information available on their occurrence, fate, and toxicity. As a result, the implications of using these chemicals are not well understood. Therefore, accurate environmental data are needed to help scientists and government policy-makers make informed decisions on research directions and chemical regulation. However, challenges exist for the analysis of emerging contaminants, including a lack of suitable analytical standards and internal standards, their broad range of chemical properties, and that they are frequently present at trace levels and in complex environmental matrices. The work presented within this dissertation focuses on the development, validation, and comparison of analytical methodologies based on large-volume injection high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for the analysis of emerging environmental contaminants in aqueous environmental matrices. Large-volume injection (e. g. 900 μL to 4, 500 μL) is an analytical technique that eliminates sample preparation associated with pre-concentration by injecting larger-than-traditional volumes of sample directly onto a HPLC column. In Chapter 2, a direct aqueous large-volume injection method was developed and validated for the quantification of natural and synthetic androgenic steroids in wastewater influent, wastewater effluent, and river water. This method was then applied to hourly composite samples of wastewater influent that were taken {{over the course of a}} single day. This work expands on the research of the endocrine-disrupting chemicals that occur in wastewater and provides an estimate of the community use/abuse of synthetic androgenic steroids. Environmental analytical methods should be as environmentally friendly as possible and efforts should be made to reduce the waste generated during analysis while maintaining analytical performance. In Chapter 3, a method based on large-volume injection was compared to two methods based on solid-phase extraction. The purpose of this comparison was to demonstrate that the same method performance could be achieved by large-volume injection as that by solid-phase extraction while reducing waste, labor, and costs. Estrogens and perfluorinated chemicals were used as model analytes and wastewater influent was used as a model matrix. The results of this study provide convincing reasons for analysts to adopt large-volume injection as an alternative to solid-phase extraction. In Chapter 4, a novel analytical method was developed and validated to quantify newly-identified and legacy <b>fluorinated</b> <b>chemicals</b> in groundwater. The final method combined micro liquid-liquid extraction, non-aqueous large-volume injection, and orthogonal chromatographic separations. Ground water samples collected from six different U. S. military bases was used to demonstrate the method. This is the first report on the occurrence of these newly-identified <b>fluorinated</b> <b>chemicals</b> in any environmental media and serves as a rational for conducting future research on their environmental fate and toxicity. The breadth of the research presented in this dissertation advances the field of environmental analytical chemistry in several areas. First, classes of environmental contaminants for which there is limited (synthetic androgenic steroids) or no (newly-identified fluorochemicals) environmental data were studied. Second, novel methods based on direct-aqueous and non-aqueous large-volume injection were developed and validated to identify and quantify those contaminants. Third, it was demonstrated that solid-phase extraction is not a "necessary evil" needed to develop methods for emerging environmental contaminants in aqueous matrices. Finally, this work is a platform on which other environmental chemists can use to develop large-volume injection methods in the future...|$|R

Ski waxes are sources of highly <b>fluorinated</b> <b>chemicals</b> to the environment {{that have not been}} investigated so far. Some contain fluorinated additives such as semifluorinated n-alkanes (SFAs). This thesis investigated the fate of SFAs after abrasion onto snow through skiing activities. Furthermore, perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAAs) were found to be present in fluorinated ski waxes. A lot of {{attention has been paid to}} elucidating the environmental fate of PFAAs during the past decade. However, nothing was known so far about their release from melting snow packs. Analytical methods for quantification of SFAs in different environmental matrices were developed. The methods were used to investigate the fate of SFAs during snow melt and to study their occurrence in ski areas. Laboratory snow melt experiments and model-based fate simulations suggested that SFAs will sorb to the snow grain surface and particles in the bulk snow and, after snowmelt, will end up on the underlying (soil) surface. SFAs were detected and quantified for the first time in snow and soil samples taken from a ski area in Sweden. Comparison of concentrations in snow and soil did not give any evidence for long-term accumulation of SFAs in surface soil, but suggested volatilization of shorter chain homologues during snow melt. Such a volatilization could also explain an observed SFA pattern difference between snow and soil samples. Laboratory scale snow melt experiments were also used to investigate the behavior of PFAAs during snowmelt. PFAAs were released with the melt water from the snow pack in pulses. The pulses occurred early, late or with a so far unknown peak elution in the middle of the snowmelt, depending on the hydrophobicity of the PFAAs. These peak releases were further influenced by the age of the snow pack and thus the snow surface area and to a lesser extent by pH and ion concentrations...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the recent}} decades, gas-condensate {{reservoirs}} have attracted increasing attention from many energy suppliers around the globe. The production and improved recovery techniques to extract more hydrocarbons from these reservoirs {{are still a}} demanding and challenging subject. Two unique and complex effects that prevail in gas/condensate flow behaviour near the wellbore are: i) negative inertia, decrease in relative permeability with increasing velocity and ii) positive coupling, increase in relative permeability with increasing velocity/decreasing IFT. When pressure near the wellbore falls below the dew-point the wetting condensate that drops out can block the gas flow paths. The water blockage can also cause severe productivity losses. In the last decade, wettability alteration of the reservoir rocks from liquid- to intermediate-gas wet conditions, using appropriate liquid-repellent chemicals, has been proposed as a new solution to mitigate the liquid hold-up around the wellbore on a relatively permanent basis compared to other common remedial techniques, e. g. solvent injection and hydraulic fracturing stimulation. Despite relatively considerable number of investigations in the literature dedicated to application of such chemical treatments in gas-condensate systems, there are still serious and important questions about {{the reliability of the}} results. That is, in all these investigations, conventional gas/oil fluids and/or procedures and conditions not representative of gas condensate reservoirs have been employed. The research work presented in this thesis is devoted to providing {{a better understanding of the}} application of such chemical treatments in gas-condensate systems and address the crucial limitations and benefits associated with this stimulation technique. The investigations performed are also aimed at finding appropriate wettability modifiers for carbonate rocks, which compared to sandstones, have received less attention. The current research study can be divided into three main parts. In the first part, results of initial screening tests performed to identify an optimized treatment solution for carbonate minerals are discussed. The conventional fluid systems such as decane-nitrogen are employed for this purpose. Initially, the static contact angle data are used to examine the performance of fifteen <b>fluorinated</b> <b>chemicals,</b> out of which four liquid-repellent agents have been short listed. The brine compatibility, spontaneous imbibition and unsteady-state displacements tests are then employed to investigate the impact of a number of important parameters including: chemical concentration, chemical particle size, solvent type, temperature, rock permeability and brine salinity. The final treatment solution developed in this part, i. e an anionic fluorosurfactant carried with methanol, is further evaluated to understand its impact on improving the fluids mobility as well as its durability. In the second part of this thesis, the performance of the optimized wettability modifier developed in the first part, is evaluated in presence of gas-condensate fluids. For this purpose, initially high pressure (and in few cases high temperature) contact angle measurements using synthetic binary- and multi-component gas-condensate mixtures are conducted. These tests, for the first time, reveal that the wetting characteristic of the treated carbonate surface is significantly dependent on the interfacial tension and molecular composition of the system. That is, by increasing the interfacial tension and/or number of carbon atoms in the system the contact angle increases. The generality of these new findings are further confirmed by performing a number of unsteady-state displacement tests. The ultimate effect of the wettability alteration is finally quantified by measuring series of steady-state relative permeability data points under various IFT and velocity conditions. The new findings demonstrate that chemical treatment performance is significantly affected by the thermodynamic and flow conditions of the gas-condensate system. In the final part of this work, a simulation exercise is carried out to complement the experimental results and provide better practical understanding of application of this chemical treatment technique. Here, a number of single-parameter simulations are initially performed, which in particular look into the favourable performance of chemical treatment versus solvent injection, water- versus alcohol-based solution and chemical treatment in mature fields with large condensate banks. In the second section of this part, the simultaneous impacts of five important parameters on well productivity are scrutinized employing statistical approaches. The five selected parameters are treatment radius, treatment uniformity, improvement factor of relative permeability, permeability damage and treatment durability. Accordingly, a Matlab-based computer programme is developed to facilitate the simulation of 1080 multi-parameter simulations using a full-factorial experimental design. The relationship between the parameters and their impact on treatment performance are then analysed using the fitted linear response surface models. It is demonstrated that the kr improvement factor has the largest positive impact on CT performance. On the other hand, permeability damage (PD) is the only negative parameter with a significant adverse impact on the CT performance. In summary, the new findings from the study provide valuable insights into the practical application of chemical treatment and offer useful guidelines on designing more effective wettability modifiers...|$|R

To synthesize labeled radiotracers, we are most interested in using 18 F as the isotope of choice {{because it is a}} nearly ideal positron emitting radionuclide. Electron-rich aromatic substrates can be particularly difficult to fluorinate. We show that reductive elimination of I(III) diaryliodonium salts provide increased fluorination of electron-rich aromatic substrates. Modest yields of fluorinated product were initially observed {{due to the lack of}} regioselectivity in the reductive elimination process. It seemed clear that a better directing group would be needed if extremely electron-rich rings are to be <b>fluorinated</b> in high <b>chemical</b> (or radiochemical) yields using diaryliodonium salts. The use of [2. 2]paracyclophane as a directing ligand has been shown by computational and experimental data to provide an increase in steric demand above the plane of the aromatic ring; therefore, destabilizing a reductive elimination transition state. This effect is sufficiently large to provide stereoelectronic control of unidirectional reductive elimination (SECURE) for most nucleophiles; however, benzyne chemistry was observed when fluorine and 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethoxide were used as nucleophiles. To address the benzyne issue, we have shown that the choice of a judiciously substituted cyclophane substituent on I(III) can provide perfect regioselectivity for reductive elimination of iodocyclophanes and fluorination of electron-rich arenes. This work constitutes the first example of regiospecific fluorination of electron-rich aromatic rings using diaryliodonium fluorides.

Preparative useful reactions were identified for hydrolyses of methyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-benzoyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (1 a), methyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-benzoyl- α-D-galactopyranoside (2 a), methyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra- O-benzoyl-ß-D-galactopyranoside (5 a), methyl 2, 3, 6 -tri-O-benzoyl-α-Dgalactopyranoside (6 a) and methyl 2, 3, 6 -tri-O-benzoyl- 4 -deoxy- 4 -fluoro-α-Dglucopyranoside (7 a). For hydrolyses of the methyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-benzoyl-α-Dmannopyranoside (3 a) and methyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-benzoyl-ß-D-glucopyranoside (4 a) low yields were experienced (< 10 %). DAST and bis(2 -methoxyethyl) aminosulfur trifluoride (Deoxo-FluorTM) have been employed in the fluorination of the benzoylated and non-benzoylated methyl pyranosides. Their reactivity was evaluated, eight new fluorinated carbohydrates were prepared and characterised by high-field NMR spectroscopy. Performed investigations demonstrated Deoxo-FluorTM as a good and safer alternative to the DAST. The use of Deoxo-FluorTM found to be especially useful in the preparation of C- 6 fluorinated methyl 2, 3, 4 -tri-O-benzoyl- 6 -deoxy- 6 -fluoro-ß-D-glucopyranoside (4 c), avoiding a regioselective C 1 →C 6 migration of the anomeric methoxy group experienced with DAST-mediated fluorination. In the fluorination of unprotected methyl α-Dmannopyranoside (23 a), the methyl 4, 6 -dideoxy- 4, 6 -difluoro-α-D-talopyranoside 2, 3 - cyclic sulfite (3 e) was isolated using both <b>fluorinating</b> agents. The <b>chemical</b> synthesis of the main metabolite of antiepileptic drug Lamotrigine, Lamotrigine-N 2 -glucuronide, has been developed using commercially available methyl (2, 3, 4 -tri-O-acetyl-α-D-glucopyranosyl bromide) uronate (12 a) as a glycosyl donor. Characterization and full 1 H and 13 C NMR assignments of the synthesised LTG-N 2 -glucuronide (13 a) have been performed by extensive NMRexperiments. As alternatives to the glycosyl bromide 12 a, fluorinated and non fluorinated benzoyl uronic acid derivatives have been prepared. Their usefulness in the glycosylation with Lamotrigine has been investigated. Glycosylation of Lamotrigine using the methyl (2, 3, 4 -tri-O-benzoyl-α-D-glucopyranosyl bromide) uronate (14 c) gave the desired Lamotrigine-N 2 -glycoside 20 a in moderate yield. However, methyl (2, 3 -di- O-benzoyl- 4 -deoxy- 4 -fluoro-α-D-glucopyranosyl bromide) uronate (16 c) proved to be unstable under refluxing conditions, and along with expected fluorinated Lamotrigine- N 2 -glycoside 18 a, the elimination of the fluorine was obtained. Finally, a number of benzoylated carbohydrate derivatives have been characterised by NMR spectroscopy PhD i kjemiPhD in Chemistr...|$|R
