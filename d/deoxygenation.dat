25|$|When the V2O5 {{is used as}} an {{intimate}} mixture with carbon, the synthesis proceeds at 200–400°C; {{in this case the}} carbon serves as a <b>deoxygenation</b> agent akin to its use in the Kroll process for the manufacturing of TiCl4 from TiO2.|$|E
25|$|Substitutions to {{pyridine}} at the 2- or 4-position {{result in}} an energetically unfavorable σ complex. They can be promoted, however, using experimental techniques, such as conducting electrophilic substitution on the pyridine N-oxide followed by <b>deoxygenation</b> of the nitrogen atom. Addition of oxygen reduces electron density on the nitrogen atom and promotes substitution at the 2- and 4-carbons. The oxygen atom can then be removed via several routes, most commonly with compounds of trivalent phosphorus or divalent sulfur, which are easily oxidized. Triphenylphosphine is a frequently used reagent, which is oxidized in this reaction to triphenylphosphine oxide. The following paragraphs describe representative electrophilic substitution reactions of pyridine.|$|E
25|$|Wastewater {{may contain}} {{high levels of}} the {{nutrients}} nitrogen and phosphorus. Excessive release to the environment {{can lead to a}} buildup of nutrients, called eutrophication, which can in turn encourage the overgrowth of weeds, algae, and cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). This may cause an algal bloom, a rapid growth in the population of algae. The algae numbers are unsustainable and eventually most of them die. The decomposition of the algae by bacteria uses up so much of the oxygen in the water that most or all of the animals die, which creates more organic matter for the bacteria to decompose. In addition to causing <b>deoxygenation,</b> some algal species produce toxins that contaminate drinking water supplies. Different treatment processes are required to remove nitrogen and phosphorus.|$|E
500|$|Another {{approach}} of preparing carbenes {{has relied on}} the desulfurisation of thioureas with potassium in THF. A contributing factor {{to the success of}} this reaction is that the byproduct, potassium sulfide, is insoluble in the solvent. The elevated temperatures suggest that this method is not suitable for the preparation of unstable dimerising carbenes. A single example of the <b>deoxygenation</b> of a urea with a fluorene derived carbene to give the tetramethyldiaminocarbene and fluorenone has also been reported: ...|$|E
2500|$|Meta {{analyses}} have quantified {{the direction}} and magnitude of {{the harmful effects of}} ocean acidification, warming and <b>deoxygenation</b> on the ocean. [...] These meta-analyses have been further tested by mesocosm studies that simulated the interaction of these stressors and found a catastrophic effect on the marine food web, i.e. that the increases in consumption from thermal stress more than negates any primary producer to herbivore increase from elevated CO2.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the full}} {{implications}} of elevated CO2 on marine ecosystems {{are still being}} documented, {{there is a substantial}} body of research showing that a combination of ocean acidification and elevated ocean temperature, driven mainly by CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, have a compounded effect on marine life and the ocean environment. [...] This effect far exceeds the individual harmful impact of either. [...] In addition, ocean warming exacerbates ocean <b>deoxygenation,</b> which is an additional stressor on marine organisms, by increasing ocean stratification, through density and solubility effects, thus limiting nutrients, {{while at the same time}} increasing metabolic demand.|$|E

50|$|The first {{review on}} HDO was {{published}} in 1983. HDO is potentially of interest for producing biofuels, which are derived from oxygen-rich precursors like sugars or lipids. Because of high capital and transportation costs, HDO is not commercially feasible for the <b>deoxygenation</b> of biomass-derived feedstocks. Instead, <b>deoxygenation</b> of biomass typically involve dehydration and decarboxylations.|$|E
