25|$|Fossils of Confuciusornis {{show that}} it had an {{exceptionally}} large humerus (upper arm bone). Near its shoulder-end this was equipped with a prominent deltopectoral crest. Characteristically this crista <b>deltopectoralis</b> was with Confuciusornis pierced by an oval hole which may have reduced the bone's weight or enlarged the attachment area of the flight miscles. The furcula or wishbone, like that of Archaeopteryx, was a simple curved bar lacking a pointed process at the back, a hypocleidum. The sternum (breastbone) was relatively broad and had a low keel which was raised at the back end. This bony keel {{may or may not}} have anchored a larger, cartilaginous, keel for enlarged pectoral muscles. The scapulae (shoulder blades) were fused to the strut-like coracoid bones and may have formed a solid base for the attachment of wing muscles. The orientation of the shoulder joint was sideways, instead of angled upward as in modern birds; this means that Confuciusornis was unable to lift its wings high above its back. According to a study by Phil Senter in 2006, the joint was even pointed largely downwards meaning that the humerus could not be lifted above the horizontal. This would make Confuciusornis incapable of the upstroke required for flapping flight; the same would have been true for Archaeopteryx.|$|E

The three fingers were about equal in length, the first being the stoutest and the second the longest. Various rough areas and impressions on the forelimbs indicate the presence of powerful muscles. Most articular surfaces of the arm bones were deeply furrowed, indicating that the animal had thick pads of cartilage between the joints. Though the arms of Deinocheirus were large, the ratio between them and the shoulder girdle was less than that of the smaller ornithomimosaur Ornithomimus. The arm bones of Deinocheirus were similar in proportions to those of the small theropod Compsognathus. The wishbone (furcula), an element not known from any other ornithomimosaurs, was U-shaped. The hindlimbs were relatively short, and the thigh bone (femur) was longer than the shin bone (tibia), as is common for large animals. The metatarsus was short and not arctometatarsalian, as in most other theropods. The claw bones of the feet were blunt and broad-tipped instead of tapered, unlike other theropods, but resembled the unguals of large ornithischian dinosaurs. The proportions of the toe bones resembled those of tyrannosaurs, due to the large weight they had to bear.|$|E

5000|$|Deinocheirus is {{the largest}} ornithomimosaurian (ostrich dinosaur) discovered; the largest known {{specimen}} measured up to 11 m long, with an estimated weight of 6.36 tonnes lb. The two other known specimens are smaller, the holotype being 94% as big while the smallest, a subadult, only 74% as big. When only the incomplete holotype arms were known, various sizes were extrapolated from them by different methods. A 2010 study estimated the hip height of Deinocheirus to be 3.3 - 3.6 m. The weight had previously been estimated between 2 tonnes lb to 12 tonnes lb. Enormous sizes were also suggested by comparing the arms with those of tyrannosaurs, even though members of that group did not have large arms in proportion to their body size.Deinocheirus and Therizinosaurus possessed the longest forelimbs known for any bipedal dinosaurs. The holotype forelimbs measure 2.4 m long — the humerus (upper arm bone) is 93.8 cm, the ulna 68.8 cm, and the hand is 77 cm — including the 19.6 cm long recurved claws. Each scapulocoracoid of the shoulder girdle has a length of 1.53 m. Each half of the paired [...] measure 42 cm.

The ten neck vertebrae were low and long, and progressively shorter backwards from the skull. This resulted in a more S-curved neck than seen in other ornithomimosaurs, due to the larger skull. The neural spines of the twelve back vertebrae became increasingly longer from front to back, the last one being 8.5 times the height of the centrum part. This is almost the same as the highest ratio in the neural spines of the theropod Spinosaurus. The neural spines had a system of interconnecting ligaments, which stiffened the vertebral column allowing it to support the abdomen while transmitting the stress to the hips and hindlimbs. Together, the neural spines formed a tall [...] "sail" [...] along the lower back, hips, and base of the tail, somewhat similar to that of Spinosaurus.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: To {{evaluate}} {{the integrity of}} the subscapularis tendon by strength, function and magnetic resonance imaging after <b>deltopectoralis</b> access for anterior shoulder instability. Methods: 20 patients with anterior shoulder instability have been evaluated. Minimum follow-up was 12 months, with a mean of 40 months. Only male patients were included, with a mean of age of 29 years (20 − 42 years). The patients have been submitted to physical examinations of mobility, muscular strength, Belly Test and Gerber Test. The isokinetic strength in internal and external rotation, in angular speeds of 600 /s and 1800 /s, for both shoulders was measured using a dynamometer. In 15 patients magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out on both shoulders for evaluating the thickness, cross-sectional area and atrophy of the subscapularis muscle. Results: A significant difference was found between torque peaks at the speed of 600 /s for internal (p= 0. 036) and external (p= 0. 008) rotation. However, at 1800 /s the opposite happens (internal rotation: p= 0. 133; external rotation: p= 0. 393). Subscapularis muscle thickness and area are significantly smaller than the normal side, with a deficit of 19 % and 23 %, respectively. According to Rowe and UCLA scores, we find excellent and good results for the majority of patients, with a mean of 88 and 31. 6 points, respectively. Conclusion: Despite of the good functional results, open surgery can limit strength and reduce the thickness and the cross-sectional area of subscapularis muscle. However, the best results were found in the patients who had the dominant side operated...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Since 1991, we {{have done}} the tracheoesophageal shunt as {{described}} by Amatsu in candidates to a total laryngectomy. Our goal is to provide the patients a better speech rehabilitation that that obtained by the non-surgical techniques, and by doing so, lessen the oncological treatment impact on the patient's quality of life. Aim: This work revises the experience of our institution with the procedure during a 10 years period. Study design: Clinical retrospective. Material and method: We had 54 patients submitted to the procedure, 3 women e 51 men, with ages from 30 to 78 years old and {{a mean age of}} 59 years. All had scamous cell carcinoma, 10 from the piriform sinus, 2 from retrocricoide area, 6 from the supraglottis, 1 from the subglottis, 16 from the glottis and 19 were transglottic. According to the AJC staging system, 3 were stage II, 17 were stage III, 24 were stage IV and 10 were not staged. Previous radiotherapy as initial treatment had been done in 18 patients. During the laryngectomy, 33 patients had some type of neck dissection and in 15 of these patients the neck dissection was done bilaterally. A myocutaneous pectoralis major flap was needed in 5 cases and a <b>deltopectoralis</b> flap was used in one case. Postoperative radiotherapy was used in 20 patients. Local infections occurred in 36 % of the cases, and all had a good outcome. One patient died in the early postoperative period. Results: Speech rehabilitation by the technique was successful in 70 % of the cases. Aspiration occurred in 10 patients and, in 2 of these, the shunt had to be surgically closed. Conclusion: In conclusion, due to its low cost, good results with few complications, the Amatsu tracheoesophageal shunt continues in our service as the main technique for speech rehabilitation after laryngectomy...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar a integridade do músculo subescapular através da força, função e ressonância nuclear magnética após acesso deltopeitoral para tratamento da luxação glenoumeral {{anterior}} recidivante. MÉTODOS: Foram avaliados 20 pacientes com luxação recidivante do ombro. Todos os casos possuíam seguimento mínimo de 12 meses, com média de 40 meses. Os pacientes eram todos do sexo masculino, com média de idade de 29 anos (20 - 42 anos). Os pacientes foram submetidos a exame físico para avaliar mobilidade, força muscular, "Belly" Teste e teste de Gerber. A força isocinética em rotação interna e externa, em velocidades angulares de 60 º/s e 180 º/s, em ambos os ombros, foi medida utilizando-se um dinamômetro. Em 15 pacientes foi realizada ressonância nuclear magnética (RNM) em ambos os ombros para avaliação da espessura, área e possível hipotrofia do músculo subescapular. RESULTADOS: Houve diferença significativa entre os picos de torque para a velocidade de 60 º/s para as rotações interna (p = 0, 036) e externa (p = 0, 008). Porém, para a velocidade de 180 º/s a situação se inverte (rotação interna: p = 0, 133; rotação externa: p = 0, 393). A espessura e a área do subescapular são significativamente menores que as do lado normal, com déficit de 19 % e 23 %, respectivamente. De acordo com os escores de Rowe e da UCLA, observamos excelentes e bons resultados na maioria dos pacientes, com média de 88 e 31, 6 pontos, respectivamente. CONCLUSÃO: Apesar dos bons resultados funcionais, a cirurgia aberta pode restringir a força, bem como reduzir a espessura e a área da seção transversal do músculo subescapular. Os melhores resultados ocorreram no lado dominante.
