25|$|Heinz tomato ketchup’s {{ingredients}} are: <b>tomato</b> concentrate <b>from</b> <b>red</b> ripe <b>tomatoes,</b> distilled vinegar, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, salt, spice, onion powder, {{and natural}} flavoring. <b>Tomato</b> concentrate <b>from</b> <b>red</b> ripe <b>tomatoes</b> {{is the first}} ingredient on the list, which means it has {{the highest percentage of}} weight within the final product. Tomatoes have a complex composition of sugars, starch, pectin, ascorbic acids, organic acids, amino acids, steroids, carotenoids, lipids, free fatty acids, and volatiles. The second ingredient listed is distilled vinegar, which is eighty percent pure water and twenty percent acetic acid. Next is high fructose corn syrup, which is made up of 42% fructose, 53% glucose, and 5% other polysaccharides and sugars. Corn syrup is 100% glucose. Salt is the next ingredient listed and is composed of sodium and chloride ions. Spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring are the last ingredients on the list, meaning that they have the least percent weight. These three ingredients contribute to overall flavor of the product.|$|R

TBN 1 {{is a relatively}} small glycoprotein and shows considerable activity in cell apoptosis, tissue differentiation and vascular system development. Therefore detailed structural study of this enzyme can lead to new ways of cancer and bacterial disease treatment. Heterologous expression of the enzyme yields amounts and quality of protein suitable for structural studies. Biochemical characterrisation of TBN 1 focused on 3 D structure determination using crystallographic methods and also crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction experiments are reviewed...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{high-resolution}} proteomics analyses of complex protein mixtures is presented using multidimensional HPLC coupled to MS (MDLC-MS). The method {{was applied to}} identify proteins that are differentially expressed during fruit ripening of <b>tomato.</b> Protein extracts <b>from</b> <b>red</b> and green <b>tomato</b> fruits were digested by trypsin. The resulting highly complex peptide mixtures were separated by strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX), and subsequently analyzed by RP nano-LC coupled to quadrupole-TOF MS. For detailed quantitative comparison, triplicate RP-LC-MS runs were performed for each SCX fraction. The resulting data sets were analyzed using MetAlign software for noise and data reduction, multiple alignment and statistical variance analysis. For each RP-LC-MS chromatogram, up to 7000 mass components were detected. Peak intensity data were compared by multivariate and statistical analysis. This revealed a clear separation between the green and <b>red</b> <b>tomato</b> samples, and a clear separation of the different SCX fractions. MS/MS spectra were collected using the data-dependent acquisition mode from a selected set of differentially detected peptide masses, enabling the identification of proteins that were differentially expressed during ripening of tomato fruits. Our approach is a highly sensitive method to analyze proteins in complex mixtures without the need of isotope labeling...|$|R

40|$|Three {{forms of}} {{pyrophosphate}} fructose- 6 -phosphate 1 -phosphotransferase (PFP) were purified from both green and <b>red</b> <b>tomato</b> (Lycopersicon esculentum) fruit: (a) a classical form (designated Q 2) containing α- (66 kilodalton) and β- (60 kilodalton) subunits; (b) a form (Q 1) containing a β-doublet subunit; and (c) a form (Q 0) {{that appeared to}} contain a β-singlet subunit. Several lines of evidence suggested that the different forms occur under physiological conditions. Q 2 was purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity; Q 1 and Q 0 were highly purified, but not to homogeneity. The distribution of the PFP forms <b>from</b> <b>red</b> (versus green) <b>tomato</b> was: Q 2, 29 % (90 %); Q 1, 47 % (6 %); and Q 0, 24 % (4 %). The major difference distinguishing the <b>red</b> <b>from</b> the green <b>tomato</b> enzymes was the fructose- 2, 6 -bisphosphate (Fru- 2, 6 -P 2) -induced change in Km for fructose- 6 -phosphate (Fru- 6 -P), the `green forms' showing markedly enhanced affinity on activation (Km decrease of 7 - 9 -fold) and the `red forms' showing either little change (Q 0, Q 1) or a relatively small (2. 5 -fold) affinity increase (Q 2). The results extend our earlier findings with carrot root to another tissue and indicate that forms of PFP showing low or no affinity increase for Fru 6 -P on activation by Fru- 2, 6 -P 2 (here Q 1 and Q 0) are associated with sugar storage, whereas the classical form (Q 2), which shows a pronounced affinity increase, is more important for starch storage...|$|R

40|$|The {{color of}} tomato fruit turns to <b>red</b> <b>from</b> green during ripening.

Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} in order to investigate the reason why <b>red</b> color <b>tomato</b> turns to light red when the fruit is stored at chilling temperature. A tomato variety (cv Rotarno) grown under greenhouse condition and harvested at red stage was used to assess color and firmness. Before storage at these temperatures, <b>red</b> <b>tomato</b> fruits were infiltrated by different concentration of antioxidants (Vitamin C, L-galactonic acid-¿-lactone and Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and also treated by hot water. The color and firmness of the fruits were measured by pigment analyzer and Zwick, respectively. Dessicator with vacuum pump was used for infiltration of antioxidants and water. Antioxidants were infiltrated through the scar of the fruits by applying 400 Mbar pressure for 15 sec. for each concentration. Red tomatoes were treated in hot water at 40, 45 and 50 °C for 2, 5 and 10 min each. All antioxidant infiltrated and hot water treated fruits were stored at 4 °C for three weeks. Statistically significant difference was not observed on color and firmness among different fruits treated by different concentration of antioxidants. Hot water treatment also showed no significant difference on color value between treated and non-treated fruits. However, hot water treated fruits scored significantly higher firmness than non-treated fruits. In general, the results showed that antioxidants as well as hot water treatment did not maintain accumulated lycopene content of the <b>red</b> <b>tomato</b> fruits which, stored at chilling temperature...|$|R

40|$|The enzyme pectin methylesterase (PME) was {{purified}} <b>from</b> <b>red</b> ripe <b>tomatoes</b> (Lycopersicon esculentum) {{and through}} affinity chromatography two isoenzymes were fractionated (t 1 PME and t 2 PME). Further {{analysis of these}} two isoenzymes, both having a molar mass of 34. 5 kDa, revealed {{a difference in the}} N-terminal sequence and in amino acid composition. t 1 PME was identified as the major isoenzyme of PME in tomato fruit In this study the aim was to develop a toolbox, consisting of monoclonal antibodies, that allows to gain insight into the in situ localization of PME in plant based food systems like tomatoes. A panel of six interesting monoclonal antibodies was raised against both isoenzymes, designated MA-TOM 1 - 12 E 11, MA-TOM 1 - 41 B 2, MA-TOM 2 - 9 H 8, MA-TOM 2 - 20 G 7, MA-TOM 2 - 31 H 1 and MA-TOM 2 - 38 A 11. The differences in epitopes between these monoclonal antibodies were determined using affinity tests towards denatured PME, cross-reactivity tests and inhibition tests. Characterization of these antibodies indicated an immunological difference between t 1 PME and t 2 PME, also revealing a conserved epitope on t 2 PME, carrot PME and strawberry PME. Different epitopes are recognized by the generated antibodies making them excellent probes for immunolocalization of PME by tissue printing. In tomato, t 1 PME and t 2 PME showed a pronounced co-localization, especially in the pericarp and the radial arms of the pericarp. Three of the generated antibodies could be used for immunolocalization of PME in carrots (Daucus carota L), which was only present in the cortex and not in the vascular cylinder of carrots.

40|$|The {{ripening}} {{of tomato}} fruit {{is a highly}} regulated process during which colour, flavour, aroma and texture change in a coordinated manner. This research work aims to correlate the colour changes measured objectively with the lycopene concentration in tomatoes during ripening at room temperature (21 and 26 °C). These results were compared with colour and lycopene content of pink and light <b>red</b> <b>tomatoes</b> stored at 14 °C, temperature used to prevent ripening and therefore extend the shelf life of the fruits. The duration of heat treatment at 100 ºC was previously optimized in order to release the maximum lycopene from chromoplasts during extraction.
