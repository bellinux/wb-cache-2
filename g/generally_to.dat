Over the protests of NAMPI, New York became the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision in Mutual Film vs. Ohio by instituting a censorship board in 1921. Virginia followed suit the next year, and eight individual states had a board by the advent of sound film.|$|E
5|$|An elf (plural: elves) {{is a type}} of human-shaped supernatural {{being in}} Germanic mythology and folklore. In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem <b>generally</b> <b>to</b> have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, {{ambivalent}} towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them. However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Hary was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the season. Developing on March5 from the monsoon trough, the storm initially moved <b>generally</b> <b>to</b> the west and gradually intensified. With favorable conditions, Hary quickly intensified on March7, developing an eye and well-defined outflow. After reaching an initial peak, the cyclone briefly weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle, by which time the storm turned southwestward toward Madagascar. Hary re-intensified and attained peak winds of 220km/h (140mph) on March10 just offshore of eastern Madagascar, which made it the first very intense tropical cyclone since 2000.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{played in}} four of the five Tests as a {{right-handed}} opening batsman, partnering the left-handed Morris, although he batted at No. 6 in the Third Test due to his rib injury. Three opening batsmen were taken on the tour, Brown being the third. During the tour matches, which were usually played consecutively with one or no days between fixtures, Bradman rotated the trio, <b>generally</b> <b>to</b> rest one from the match while the other two opened.N- Notable exceptions occurred in the first two Tests, the opening match against Worcestershire and the warm-up match against the MCC. In those matches, Australia fielded its first-choice team and as a result, Brown played out of position in the middle order while Morris and Barnes opened. An occasional leg spin bowler, Barnes delivered only 65.4 overs during the first-class matches, five of which were in Tests. He took two wickets, both outside the Test arena.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Honorinina was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that struck eastern Madagascar in March 1986. The eighth named storm of the season, Honorinina formed on March9 {{to the south of}} Diego Garcia. It moved <b>generally</b> <b>to</b> the west-southwest due to a ridge to the south, gradually intensifying. On March12, the Météo France office on Réunion (MFR) upgraded Honorinina to tropical cyclone status, which is the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. On the next day, the cyclone attained maximum sustained winds of 150km/h (95mph) while in the vicinity of Tromelin Island. Honorinina weakened subsequently before making landfall about 40km (25mi) north of Toamasina, Madagascar with winds of 135km/h (85mph). The storm weakened further over land, moving southwestward across the country. It emerged into the Mozambique Channel and became extratropical on March18. Honorinina turned to the southeast, dissipating on March23.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the policy}} of the Christian {{authorities}} was <b>generally</b> <b>to</b> block such emigration. Consequently, this option was only practically doable for the wealthiest among those living near the southern coast, and even then with great difficulty. For example, in Sierra Bermeja, Granada in 1501, an option of exile was offered as an alternative to conversion only for those who paid a fee of ten gold doblas, which most citizens could not afford. In the same year, villagers of Turre and Teresa near Sierra Cabrera in Almeria fought the Christian militias with help from their North African rescuers at Mojácar while leaving the region. The people of Turre were defeated and the planned escape turned into a massacre; the people of Teresa got away but their properties, except what could fit into their small boats, were left behind and confiscated.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Charlie {{developed}} on August21 {{to the southwest}} of the Cape Verde islands. At the time, the Weather Bureau did not consider Charlie to be a tropical cyclone until almost a week later. For four days, the storm tracked <b>generally</b> <b>to</b> the west as a weak tropical storm. On August25, it turned to the northwest and intensified, becoming a hurricane on August28. On August30, Charlie attained peak winds of 110mph (175km/h), although the Hurricane Hunters estimated higher winds. At the time, the hurricane was stalled to the east-southeast of Bermuda, and subsequently turned to a westward drift. On September2, Charlie turned {{to the north and}} northeast. At the time, it co-existed with two other hurricanes, Dog and Easy; it is a rare occurrence for three hurricanes to exist simultaneously in the Atlantic. Charlie slowly weakened and lost tropical characteristics, and by September5 Charlie had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 480mi (775km) southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It dissipated later on September5 without having affected land.|$|E
