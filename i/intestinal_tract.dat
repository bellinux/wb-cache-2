5|$|Another medical {{study as}} part of the MetaHit (Metagenomics of the Human <b>Intestinal</b> <b>Tract)</b> project {{consisted}} of 124 individuals from Denmark and Spain consisting of healthy, overweight, and irritable bowel disease patients. The study attempted to categorize the depth and phylogenetic diversity of gastrointestinal bacteria. Using Illumina GA sequence data and SOAPdenovo, a de Bruijn graph-based tool specifically designed for assembly short reads, they were able to generate 6.58 million contigs greater than 500 bp for a total contig length of 10.3 Gb and a N50 length of 2.2 kb.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{exist in}} {{a broad range of}} habitats, and as a major part of global ecosystems, may {{represent}} about 20% of microbial cells in the oceans. The first-discovered archaeans were extremophiles. Indeed, some archaea survive high temperatures, often above , as found in geysers, black smokers, and oil wells. Other common habitats include very cold habitats and highly saline, acidic, or alkaline water. However, archaea include mesophiles that grow in mild conditions, in swamps and marshland, sewage, the oceans, the <b>intestinal</b> <b>tract</b> of animals, and soils.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{can suffer}} from both {{external}} and internal parasites, but under farmed conditions are more parasite-free than ostriches or rheas. External parasites include the louse Dahlemhornia asymmetrica and various other lice, ticks, mites and flies. Chicks sometimes suffer from <b>intestinal</b> <b>tract</b> infections caused by coccidian protozoa, and the nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis infects the emu {{as well as a}} wide range of other birds, causing haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Other nematodes are found in the trachea and bronchi; Syngamus trachea causing haemorrhagic tracheitis and Cyathostoma variegatum causing serious respiratory problems in juveniles.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} {{that in some}} people, development of schizophrenia is related to <b>intestinal</b> <b>tract</b> dysfunction such as seen with non-celiac gluten sensitivity or abnormalities in the intestinal flora. A subgroup of persons with schizophrenia present an immune response to gluten different from that found in people with celiac, with elevated levels of certain serum biomarkers of gluten sensitivity such as anti-gliadin IgG or anti-gliadin IgA antibodies.|$|E
5|$|When sieved {{from the}} water, food is {{swallowed}} and travels through the esophagus where it enters a three-chambered-stomach. The first compartment {{is known as}} the fore-stomach; this is where food gets ground up into an acidic liquid, which is then squirted into the main stomach. Like in humans, the food is mixed with hydrochloric acid and protein-digesting enzymes. Then, the partly digested food is moved into the third stomach, where it meets fat-digesting enzymes, and is then mixed with an alkaline liquid to neutralize the acid from the fore-stomach to prevent damage to the <b>intestinal</b> <b>tract.</b> Their <b>intestinal</b> <b>tract</b> is highly adapted to absorb the most nutrients from food; the walls are folded and contain copious blood vessels, allowing for a greater surface area over which digested food and water can be absorbed. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food; however, the salt content of most of their prey (invertebrates) are similar to that of seawater, whereas the salt content of a whale's blood is considerably lower (three times lower) than that of seawater. The whale kidney is adapted to excreting excess salt; however, while producing urine more concentrated than seawater, it wastes a lot of water which must be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins are {{classified}} as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. In humans there are 13 vitamins: 4 fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and 9 water-soluble (8 B vitamins and vitamin C). Water-soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and, in general, are readily excreted from the body, {{to the degree that}} urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption. Because they are not as readily stored, more consistent intake is important. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed through the <b>intestinal</b> <b>tract</b> with the help of lipids (fats). Because {{they are more likely to}} accumulate in the body, they are more likely to lead to hypervitaminosis than are water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamin regulation is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis.|$|E

5|$|The study {{demonstrated}} that two bacterial divisions, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, constitute over 90% {{of the known}} phylogenetic categories that dominate distal gut bacteria. Using the relative gene frequencies found within the gut these researchers identified 1,244 metagenomic clusters that are critically important {{for the health of}} the <b>intestinal</b> <b>tract.</b> There are two types of functions in these range clusters: housekeeping and those specific to the intestine. The housekeeping gene clusters are required in all bacteria and are often major players in the main metabolic pathways including central carbon metabolism and amino acid synthesis. The gut-specific functions include adhesion to host proteins and the harvesting of sugars from globoseries glycolipids. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome were shown to exhibit 25% fewer genes and lower bacterial diversity than individuals not suffering from irritable bowel syndrome indicating that changes in patientsâ€™ gut biome diversity may be associated with this condition.|$|E

25|$|Viscous fibers thicken the {{contents}} of the <b>intestinal</b> <b>tract</b> and may attenuate the absorption of sugar, reduce sugar response after eating, and reduce lipid absorption (notably shown with cholesterol absorption). Their use in food formulations is often limited to low levels, due to their viscosity and thickening effects.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the ability of}} Giardia duodenalis trophozoites, isolated from a wild bird, to colonize the <b>intestinal</b> <b>tracts</b> of companion animals (kittens) and domestic ruminants (lambs). Trophozoites colonized the <b>intestinal</b> <b>tracts</b> of intraduodenally inoculated animals as demonstrated by increasing parasite burdens within the duodenum and jejunum and by fecal passage of cysts within 4 days post-inoculation. The pathogenesis of the trophozoites was further investigated in kittens. In these animals, infection significantly reduced jejunal brush border microvillous length and density, {{which resulted in a}} loss of overall epithelial brush border surface area. This injury was associated with the production of diarrhea in four of five infected kittens. These findings indicate that some bird species may carry G. duodenalis that represent a possible health threat to companion animals and livestock.

40|$|Escherichia coli x 17 ? 6, {{a strain}} created from Escherichia coli K 12, {{is used as}} an EK 2 host (17) in plasmid {{engineering}} experiments. It is unable to survive passage through the <b>intestinal</b> <b>tracts</b> of rats at frequencies of less than 10 - 11 bacteria per milliliter because of several mutations that cause sensitivity to bile and requirements for diaminoÂ­ pimelic acid (DAP) and thymine (15). Although DNA degradation accompanies thymine-less death in in vitro experiments and is an all-or-none response for any given cell (15), {{it is likely that}} lysis associated with DAP-less death may liberate DNA prior to its degradation. Since undegraded recombinant DNA might be taken up by robust microorganisms encountered in the natural environment, especially in the <b>intestinal</b> <b>tracts</b> of humans after inadvertant ingestion by laboratory workers, by the mechanism of transformation, or as a consequence of conÂ­comitant phage infection, it is important to determine the "survival potential" of such DNA in non-laboratory controlled environments...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} ileal Clostridium perfringens quantification results {{produced by}} real-time PCR and culture-based methods in broiler chickens in a challenge model of necrotic enteritis. Assessment {{of the relative}} standard deviations (RSDs) revealed that the real-time PCR assay generated a smaller standard deviation and thus was more precise than the culture-based method. Linear regression analysis indicated that the bacterial counts of these two methods were highly correlated (R 2 0. 845). We suggest that real-time PCR could be a replacement of the culture method for quantifying C. perfringens in the <b>intestinal</b> <b>tracts</b> of broiler chickens. Clostridium perfringens, a Gram-positive spore-forming and anaerobic nonmotile rod bacterium, is an important patho-genic bacterium in humans and livestock.
