METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study among 631 patients with a first-ever transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke, aged 18 to 50 years. Survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard analysis were used to estimate cumulative mortality and hazard ratios for patients with and without epilepsy. RESULTS: After mean follow-up of 12. 5 years (SD 8. 6), 76 (12. 0 %) developed poststroke epilepsy. Case fatality was 27. 4 % for patients with poststroke epilepsy and 2. 1 % for those without. Poststroke epilepsy was associated with 30 -day mortality (hazard ratio, 4. 8; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 7 - 14. 0) and long-term mortality (hazard ratio, 1. 8; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 - 2. 9).

40|$|Rationale: <b>Epilepsy</b> and {{headache}} <b>are</b> both frequent in childhood. Because seizures <b>are</b> frequently <b>a</b> frightening event, {{other medical}} conditions - including headache - are often neglected {{not only by}} the patient, but also by the physician. The objective {{of this study was to}} verify the comorbidity between headache and epilepsy in childhood. Methods: This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> prospective study conducted at the pediatric epilepsy clinic of our university hospital. Fifty children with epilepsy and ability to describe their symptoms, between 5 and 18 years old, were interviewed according to a semi-structured questionnaire. The headache was classified according to the International Headache Society. The frequency of headache was compared with the findings of a control group composed by children without epilepsy, siblings of children with epilepsy. Results: Fifty children were evaluated, 29 boys, mean age 11 years. Twenty-three (46 %) patients presented with headache, as opposed to only 1 (2. 5 %) in the control group (p< 0. 01). Ten (43. 5 %) had migraine, 4 (17. 4 %) had tension type headache and in 9 (39. 1 %) the type of headache could not be established. In 9 / 23 (39 %) a temporal relationship between headache and <b>epilepsy</b> <b>was</b> present, 6 postictal and 3 preictal. There was no difference in gender, age, type of seizure and family history of headache in the groups of patients with or without headache. However, most patients with headache were older than 10 years (54. 5 %) and had idiopathic epilepsy (65. 2 %; p < 0. 01). The headache usually started in the same year or after the diagnosis of epilepsy (95 %; p < 0. 01).

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Epilepsy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> {{neurological}} disorder with seizures, but diagnostic approaches in veterinary clinics remain limited. Cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) {{is a body}} fluid used for diagnosis in veterinary medicine. In this study, we explored canine epilepsy diagnostic biomark-ers using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) -based metabolic profiling of CSF and multivariate data analysis. Profiles for subjects with idiopathic epilepsy differed significantly from those of healthy controls and subjects with symptomatic epilepsy. Among 60 identified metabolites, the levels of 20 differed significantly among the three groups. Glutamic acid was significantly increased in idiopathic epilepsy, and some metabolites including ascorbic acid were changed in both forms of epilepsy. These findings show that metabolic profiles of CSF differ between idiopathic and symptomatic epilepsy and that metabolites including glutamic acid and ascorbic acid in CSF may be useful for diagnosis of canine epilepsy.
