50|$|Deep-sea {{fish are}} fish {{that live in}} the {{darkness}} below the sunlit surface waters, that is below the <b>epipelagic</b> or photic <b>zone</b> of the sea. The lanternfish is, by far, the most common deep-sea fish. Other deep sea fishes include the flashlight fish, cookiecutter shark, bristlemouths, anglerfish, viperfish, and some species of eelpout.|$|R
25|$|Coastal fish (also called neritic or inshore fish) {{inhabit the}} waters near {{the coast and}} above the {{continental}} shelf. Since the continental shelf is usually less than 200 metres deep, it follows that coastal fish that are not demersal fish are usually epipelagic fish, inhabiting the sunlit <b>epipelagic</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
25|$|The swimbladders of {{deep sea}} fish are either absent or {{scarcely}} operational, and bathypelagic fish do not normally undertake vertical migrations. Filling bladders at such great pressures incurs huge energy costs. Some deep sea fishes have swimbladders which function {{while they are}} young and inhabit the upper <b>epipelagic</b> <b>zone,</b> but they wither or fill with fat when the fish move down to their adult habitat.|$|E
25|$|Coastal fish, {{also called}} inshore fish or neritic fish, inhabit the sea between the {{shoreline}} and {{the edge of}} the continental shelf. Since the continental shelf is usually less than 200 metres deep, it follows that pelagic coastal fish are generally epipelagic fish, inhabiting the sunlit <b>epipelagic</b> <b>zone.</b> Coastal fish can be contrasted with oceanic fish or offshore fish, which inhabit the deep seas beyond the continental shelves.|$|E

50|$|Although early {{research}} suggested sunfish {{moved around}} mainly by drifting with ocean currents, individuals {{have been recorded}} swimming 26 km in a day, at {{a top speed of}} 3.2 km/h.Sunfish are pelagic and swim at depths to 600 m. Contrary to the perception that sunfish spend much of their time basking at the surface, M. mola adults actually spend a large portion of their lives submerged at depths greater than 200 m, occupying both the <b>epipelagic</b> and mesopelagic <b>zones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Abraliopsis morisii is {{a species}} of bioluminescent squid in the family Enoploteuthidae. The species occurs in {{tropical}} to warm temperate waters in the Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea. It {{can be found in}} the <b>epipelagic</b> and mesopelagic <b>zones.</b> Jean Baptiste Vérany described the species in 1839 and it reaches lengths of 25 to 33 mm. It is rated as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|R
25|$|The {{dominant}} bathypelagic fishes {{are small}} bristlemouth and anglerfish; fangtooth, viperfish, daggertooth and barracudina are also common. These fishes are small, many about 10 centimetres long, and not many longer than 25cm. They {{spend most of}} their time waiting patiently in the water column for prey to appear or to be lured by their phosphors. What little energy is available in the bathypelagic zone filters from above in the form of detritus, faecal material, and the occasional invertebrate or mesopelagic fish. About 20% of the food that has its origins in the <b>epipelagic</b> <b>zone</b> falls down to the mesopelagic zone, but only about 5% filters down to the bathypelagic zone.|$|E
25|$|The <b>epipelagic</b> <b>zone</b> is vast, and is {{the home}} for most pelagic fish. The zone is well lit so visual predators can use their eyesight, is usually well mixed and oxygenated from wave action, and {{can be a good}} habitat for algae to grow. However, it is an almost featureless habitat. This lack of habitat {{diversity}} results in a lack of species diversity, so the zone supports less than 2% of the world's known fish species. Much of the zone lacks nutrients for supporting fish, so epipelagic fish tend to be found in coastal water above the continental shelves, where land runoff can provide nutrients, or in those parts of the ocean where upwelling moves nutrients into the area.|$|E
25|$|Most mesopelagic fish make daily {{vertical}} migrations, {{moving at}} night into the <b>epipelagic</b> <b>zone,</b> often following similar migrations of zooplankton, {{and returning to}} the depths for safety during the day. These vertical migrations often occur over a large vertical distances, and are undertaken {{with the assistance of}} a swimbladder. The swimbladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up, and, given the high pressures in the messoplegic zone, this requires significant energy. As the fish ascends, the pressure in the swimbladder must adjust to prevent it from bursting. When the fish wants to return to the depths, the swimbladder is deflated. Some mesopelagic fishes make daily migrations through the thermocline, where the temperature changes between 10 and 20°C, thus displaying considerable tolerances for temperature change.|$|E
50|$|Its {{latitudinal}} range {{extends from}} 59°N to 46°S. Its temperature range is 10 - 25 C. Its depth range is 0 - 600 m in the <b>epipelagic</b> and mesopelagic <b>zones.</b> It {{is most often}} found in surface waters 15.6 - 19.4 C in temperature, though larger individuals {{can be found in}} deeper waters 13.5 - 25.2 C. It can survive at temperatures as low as 9.5 C for short periods of time. It favors areas where warm and cool water mix.|$|R
40|$|Respiration (= oxygen consumption) and {{chemical}} composition [water content, ash, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) ] were determined for seven chaetognaths (Parasagitta elegans, Caecosagitta macrocephala, Pseudosagitta scrippsae, Solidosagitta zetesios, Eukrohnia hamata, Eukrohnia bathypelagica and Eukrohnia fowleri) from the <b>epipelagic</b> through bathypelagic <b>zones</b> (< 3000 m) {{in the western}} subarctic Pacific Ocean. Enzyme activities of the electron transfer system (ETS) were also determined on mesopelagic and bathypelagic chaetognaths, and ETS:Respiration ratios were calculated to confirm the validity of respiration rates measured at near in situ temperature but under normal pressure (1 atm). These data were combined with literature data from Arctic, Antarctic, temperate and tropical waters, and <b>epipelagic</b> through bathypelagic <b>zones.</b> A total of 25 data sets on 17 chaetognaths for respiration, {{and a total of}} 18 – 34 data sets on 18 – 21 chaetognaths for chemical composition were used to explore important parameters affecting their respiration rates {{and chemical}} composition. Designating body mass (dry mass, C or N), ambient temperature, oxygen saturation and sampling depth as independent variables, stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that body mass, habitat temperature and sampling depth were significant, attributing 82 – 93 % of the variance of respiration rates. No significant effect of sampling depth and habitat temperature was detected in the chemical composition. These results are compared with those of copepods to highlight unique features of chaetognaths...|$|R
5000|$|The {{albacore}} (Thunnus alalunga), known also as the longfin tuna, is {{a species}} of tuna of the order Perciformes. It is found in temperate and tropical waters across the globe in the <b>epipelagic</b> and mesopelagic <b>zones.</b> There are six distinct stocks known globally in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, {{as well as the}} Mediterranean Sea. The albacore has an elongate, [...] body with a conical snout, large eyes, and remarkably long pectoral fins. Its body is a deep blue dorsally and shades of silvery white ventrally. Individuals can reach up to 1.4 m in length.|$|R
500|$|An {{inhabitant}} of {{the open}} ocean, the longfin mako generally remains in the upper mesopelagic zone {{during the day and}} ascends into the <b>epipelagic</b> <b>zone</b> at night.

Nighttime captures from relatively shallow depths suggest that this species may make a diel vertical migration, rising from the mesopelagic zone to the <b>epipelagic</b> <b>zone</b> at night to feed. In Brazilian waters, bigeye sand tigers are only captured in spring, hinting at some type of seasonal migratory movement.|$|E
50|$|Ichthyoplankton (planktonic or {{drifting}} fish) are {{the eggs}} and larvae of fish. They are usually found in the sunlit zone of the water column, less than 200 metres deep, sometimes called the <b>epipelagic</b> or photic <b>zone.</b> Ichthyoplankton are planktonic, meaning they cannot swim effectively under their own power, but must drift with ocean currents. Fish eggs cannot swim at all, and are unambiguously planktonic. Early stage larvae swim poorly, but later stage larvae swim better and cease to be planktonic as they grow into juveniles. Fish larvae {{are part of the}} zooplankton that eat smaller plankton, while fish eggs carry their own food supply. Both eggs and larvae are themselves eaten by larger animals.|$|R

40|$|Deep-sea fishes inhabit an {{environment}} where light plays a crucial ecological role with consequences on their behaviour, but little is known on how visual adaptations evolved to these specific light conditions. The mesopelagic zone is {{the transition from the}} upward <b>epipelagic</b> photic <b>zone</b> to the downward abyssopelagic aphotic zone. In this dim environment only monochromatic blue (470 - 490 nm) light is available, from the faint down-welling sunlight and the abundant bioluminescent species. Behaviour and survival depend on well-developed visual adaptations, once light is responsible for inter- and intraspecific interactions (e. g. communication, foraging, defense, and reproduction). Generally, mesopelagic fishes are diel vertical migrators, swimming to shallower depths to feed at night and stay in dormancy at mesopelagic depths during daytime. This migratory behaviour is influenced by vertical distribution of potential prey and visual predators. Deep-sea fishes possess high-density pure rod retina with high rhodopsin concentrations, conferring them a sensitive scotopic vision well adapted to the mesopelagic light conditions. In this study, retinal wholemounting technique was applied to study characteristics and sensitivity of the myctophid Diaphus sp. retinae. This technique produces topographic maps of photoreceptor and retinal ganglionar cells, showing how these fishes are adapted to the specific light regime of mesopelagic zone...|$|R
500|$|The stratum of {{the water}} column nearest {{the surface of the}} ocean (sea level) is {{referred}} to as the photic zone. The photic zone can be subdivided into two different vertical regions. The uppermost portion of the photic zone, where there is adequate light to support photosynthesis by phytoplankton and plants, {{is referred to as the}} euphotic zone (also referred to as the <b>epipelagic</b> <b>zone,</b> or surface zone). The lower portion of the photic zone, where the light intensity is insufficient for photosynthesis, is called the dysphotic zone (dysphotic means [...] "poorly lit" [...] in Greek).

40|$|Respiration and ammonia {{excretion}} {{rates of}} 19 – 24 euphausiids from the <b>epipelagic</b> through bathypelagic <b>zones</b> of the world’s oceans were compiled. Body mass (expressed {{in terms of}} dry mass, carbon or nitrogen), habitat temperature and sampling depth were designated as parameters in multiple regression analysis. Results suggested that the three parameters were highly significant, contributing 71 – 89 % {{of the variance in}} respiration rates and 69 – 81 % of the variance in ammonia excretion rates. Atomic O:N ratios derived from simultaneous measurements of respiration and ammonia excretion rates ranged from 11 to 90 (median: 27), and no appreciable effects of the three parameters on O:N ratios were detected. If global-bathymetric models for the metabolism and chemical composition of copepods and chaetognaths are compared with those of euphausiids, it becomes evident that euphausiids are unique in that they maintain high metabolic rates and accumulate moderate amounts of energy reserves (lipids) ...|$|R
40|$|Respiration and ammonia {{excretion}} {{data and}} chemical composition data [water content, ash, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and C:N ratios] of 13 – 32 mysids from freshwater, coastal littoral, <b>epipelagic</b> and abyssopelagic <b>zones</b> of the world's oceans were compiled. The independent variables including body mass, habitat temperature and sampling depth were all {{significant predictors of}} respiration, accounting for 74 – 85 % {{of the variance in}} the data, while body mass and habitat temperature were significant predictors of ammonia excretion, accounting for 85 – 86 % of the variance. Atomic O:N ratios (respiration: ammonia excretion) ranged from 7. 9 to 44. 8 (median: 18. 7), indicating protein-oriented metabolism. Body water content and ash were not correlated with body mass, habitat temperature and sampling depth, but C composition and N composition increased and decreased, respectively, with the increase of sampling depth.

40|$|Respiration and ammonia {{excretion}} {{data and}} chemical composition data [water content, ash, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and C:N ratios] of 18 – 32 amphipods (hyperiids and gammarids) from the <b>epipelagic</b> through bathypelagic <b>zones</b> of the world’s oceans were compiled. The independent variables including body mass, habitat temperature and mid-sampling depth were all {{significant predictors of}} respiration, accounting for 65 – 83 % {{of the variance in}} the data, while the former two variables were significant predictors of ammonia excretion, accounting for 64 – 77 % of the variance. Atomic O:N ratios (respiration:ammonia excretion) ranged from 11 to 74 (median 21. 5). C composition was negatively correlated with habitat temperature, but water contents, ash, N, and the C:N ratio were uncorrelated with the three independent variables. As judged by C:N ratios, protein was considered to be the major organic component of most pelagic amphipods. However, some amphipods from > 500 m depth exhibited high C:N ratios (> 10) suggesting a large deposition of lipids in the body. Comparison of the present results with global bathymetric models of euphausiids and pelagic copepods revealed that respiration rates of the pelagic amphipods were near-equal to the rates of euphausiids but greater than the rates of pelagic copepods, reflecting taxon-specific body morphology and swimming behavior among the three taxa. As a marked feature of body chemical composition, the pelagic amphipods exhibited extremely high ash content (mean 25 % of DM) due to their possession of a robust exoskeleton...|$|R
2500|$|In deep water, {{marine snow}} is a {{continuous}} shower of mostly organic detritus {{falling from the}} upper layers of the water column. Its origin lies in activities within the productive photic zone. Marine snow includes dead or dying plankton, protists (diatoms), fecal matter, sand, soot and other inorganic dust. The [...] "snowflakes" [...] grow over time and may reach several centimetres in diameter, travelling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor. However, most organic components of marine snow are consumed by microbes, zooplankton and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey, that is, within the <b>epipelagic</b> <b>zone.</b> In this way marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea mesopelagic and benthic ecosystems: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface waters}} are sunlit.

The <b>epipelagic</b> <b>zone</b> is usually low in nutrients.

40|$|Living {{elasmobranchs}} occupy {{every major}} aquatic ecosystem {{throughout the world}} (Compagno 2003; Compagno et al. 2005). Sensory ecology {{can be a good}} determinant in comprehending the processes occurring between an organism and its natural environment (Weissburg and Browman 2005). By utilizing ecophysiological tools, insight into the adaptive responses of the sensory systems to their ever-changing ecological niche can help explain behavioral and life history characteristics (Hueter 1991; Litherland 2009). Aquatic animals show structural and physiological adaptations in their visual sense specific to the ecological requirements of their habitat (Hart et al. 2004), implying that vision is an important modality. The visual system of the smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis, family Triakidae) was examined using corneal electrophysiological methods to determine the visual spectral range, irradiance sensitivity, and speed of vision (flicker fusion frequency, FFF). The smooth dogfish, a shallow water bottom feeder inhabiting inshore waters along the eastern United States, was found to be extremely sensitive to dim light (- 3. 1 - 0. 1 log light intensity), and have a slow FFF (13 Hz), thus being well adapted to the scotopic conditions of the turbid coastal inshore waters. This prompted a second set of experiments focusing on the chromatic adaptations of the photoreceptor cells and retina function following light adaptation. Light adaptation increased the photopic threshold by 2. 0 log light units of intensity (LLI). However, the temporal resolution was not dramatically increased (to 17 Hz), indicating that the retinal integration time is very slow for this species under all circumstances. The spectral sensitivity peak for M. canis (470 nm) was found to be significantly blue-shifted in comparison to other members of the Triakidae family (Crescitelli et al. 1995; Sillman et al. 1996). Smooth dogfish appear to forgo high spatial and temporal resolution for the enhancement of photon capture. The sandbar shark inhabits the same inshore estuaries during the summer months but has a visual system with a higher temporal resolution (FFF, 54 Hz) and a brighter photopic threshold (1. 2 LLI- 50 % max) (Litherland 2009). Furthermore, other elasmobranch or telelost species inhabiting similar photic environments also exhibit faster temporal resolution; little skate (FFF, 30 Hz), weakfish (FFF, 40 Hz), red drum (FFF, 50 Hz), spotted sea trout (FFF, 60 Hz), and Atlantic croaker (FFF, 58 Hz) (Horodysky et al. 2008; McComb et al. 2010). Coastal seas tend to contain more dissolved organics and particulates than the clear oceanic waters of the <b>epipelagic</b> and pelagic <b>zones</b> (McFarland 1986), therefore the retina of smooth dogfish has adapted to be extremely sensitive to dim light, has a long integration time, a low flicker fusion frequency and temporal resolution, and retinal cells that are able to adjust to changing light conditions. All of these factors contribute to the visual system to provide optimal visual ability to enable smooth dogfish to accurately exploit its surroundings...|$|R
