40|$|A {{sample of}} the Oadby Till from Buddon Wood Quarry, Mountsorrel, Leicestershire was {{examined}} for its microfossil and palynomorph content, {{in order to determine}} the age and provenance of this deposit. Early Jurassic (Hettangian) <b>Foraminiferida</b> and Ostracoda were found, together with Late Cretaceous (late Coniacian-Santonian) <b>Foraminiferida.</b> The Early Jurassic microfauna was probably relatively locally derived from the east or northeast, but the late Cretaceous taxa must have been derived from the Chalk outcrop again to the east or northeast. The palynoflora indicates input from the Carboniferous, Late Triassic (Rhaetian), Jurassic (late Sinemurian, late Callovian-Oxfordian and Kimmeridgian) and Late Cretaceous. The dominant species, Classopollis classoides, is likely to be largely from the Triassic, so the dominant reworked element in this till is Rhaetian. The occurrence of Jurassic and Cretaceous palynomorphs from the east/northeast suggests that the relatively minor Carboniferous reworking is probably from the underlying Thrussington Till. This is as opposed to locally from the Swadlincote coalfield to the northwest, or from further away such as the northeast of England. The Rhaetian reworking is assumed to have been sourced locally, again from an easterly or northeasterly direction. The Blue Anchor Formation is typically organic-poor, hence the source of these palynomorphs is considered to be from the Westbury and/or Lilstock formations. The Jurassic input is assumed to be from the north or northeast. The principal Jurassic outcrop belt in the UK could have potentially sourced all the late Sinemurian, late Callovian-Oxfordian and Kimmeridgian input. The Chalk Group dinoflagellate cysts are also interpreted as having being sourced from the east or the northeast. Integration of the calcareous microfaunal and palynological evidence indicates that the Oadby Till from this locality contains stratal units of Carboniferous, Triassic, Jurassic and Late Cretaceous age. Because of the presence of Jurassic and Late Cretaceous elements, the ice apparently travelled to Mountsorrel from the east or northeast...|$|E

40|$|Studies {{of living}} benthonic foraminiferal assemblages {{carried out by}} marine {{biologists}} are comparatively rare. This study {{of the changes in}} foraminiferal assemblages from three subtidal sites near Plymouth, U. K., has been carried out with the intention of determining the importance of various abiotic and biotic variables to the foraminiferal communities studied using statistical correlation. Temperature and salinity at depth and particle size characteristics together with organic content, bacterial abundance and type, and other meiofauna present were assessed monthly with samples taken for foraminiferal content, and for seasonal diatom analysis. Deformed specimens were very rare in the examined samples of natural assemblages. Three different systems were used in an attempt to culture Elphidium crispiim (Linne) for ecotoxicological studies, which failed. Ecotoxicological studies were carried out upon Roialieila elaticam Pawlowski & Lee and adult Ammonia batavits (Hofker). The types of deformation produced by laboratory-maintained <b>Foraminiferida</b> were found not to be specific to the stressor used and, therefore, the use of this group of Protozoa as indicators of specific pollution is not possible.

Seven locations [stations] were sampled for microfossils. Latitude and longitude coordinates found using Figure 2 and a 06 January 2011 Google Earth scene. One hundred and forty-one species and subspecies of Late Cretaceous (Late Campanian) <b>Foraminiferida</b> are recorded in seven samples from a l 05 -meter section and the immediate vicinity of an exhumed, offshore oceanic ridge enveloped by claystone of the Rosario Formation near Valle El Morro, northwest Baja California, Mexico. 	Three faunules are recognized from the vicinity of the ridge. The richly fossiliferous Gavelinella multi-punctata Faunule is exhibited in strata lying on the ridge. The faunule is noted by a diverse assemblage of benthonic foraminifers and 35 per cent planktonic specimens, ostracods, nannoplankton, echinoids, brachiopods and mollusks, including Ostrea (?) and Spondylus, suggesting a warm, shelf environment supporting high organic production. Strata deposited adjacent to the ridge are characterized by the richly arenaceous Haplophragmoides spp. Faunule which possibly developed in an oxygen deficient environment beneath surface waters supporting high organic production.

40|$|Paleoecological {{analysis}} of foraminiferal, ostracod and molluscan assemblages from Holocene marine sediments of La Starza sequences (Pozzuoli, Italy) {{allows us to}} point out the following evidences: - changes in paleobathymetry, gradually increasing from 10 - 20 m at the base to a maximum of about 40 - 50 m. Marine facies are rapidly replaced by continental sediments (beach sands) towards the top. The change in paleobathymetry is hypothetically correlated to the bradyseismic effects developed between 6000 and 4000 years B. P.; -low pH values and low calcium carbonate content, chiefly in the basal part of the sequence, as testified by impoverished assemblages, evidences of dissolution on various shell types, and absence of porcellaneous foraminifers; -low dissolved oxygen content, suggested by the the absence of agglutinated foraminifers and, conversely, by the abundance of Nonionella turgid. Elphidium excavatum and inflated morphotypes of Ammonia tepida and Protelphidium granosum; - rather low environmental energy testified by the constant presence among the ostracods of instars and numerous complete carapaces belonging to genera with feeble hinge; - evolution, toward the top of the sequences, from assemblages characteristic of sandy-muddy bottoms to those of muddy bottoms, with episodic evidences of seagrass, as suggested by the structural and functional (trophic organization) changes affecting the mollusk fauna; - predation phenomena recorded both on micro and macrofauna.

40|$|Shelled granuloreticulose {{microorganisms}} {{have had}} a complex etymological history that began in 1826 when d’Orbigny gave his new order the name Foraminifères and characterized the group. Soon afterwards, further examina-tion and proper Latinization established them as class Foraminifera. D’Orbigny should be credited with the suprafamilial group name, regardless of rank, because he provided defining characteristics, and also because higher taxa are not governed by ICZN rules; in addition, we should consider the history of its attribution and what is traditional and customary in zoological nomenclature. The name Foraminifera {{is the source of}} a variety of informal terms, including foraminifera, foraminifer, foraminiferan, and for-am. Long after being demoted to order, the Latinized name was modified to <b>Foraminiferida</b> in 1964 by Loeblich and Tappan, the informal foraminiferid was introduced later. Here, we briefly examine these terms as sets of singular and plural nouns, and their derived adjectives and nouns that begin with foram-. Authors can choose any of the derived terms, but they should be consistent by using only one term-set throughout their paper. Other nouns derived from forami-nifer-, such as foraminiferologist for a student of the group, are not usually part of a term-set. The informal term foram is a valid derivation and it is the most common of the names used in conversation among earth scientists and biologists. It is already accepted in major dictionaries and literature, and it has been used in specific word pairs found in scientific publications. In addition, foram eases communication by its multilingual applicability; it is also the easiest of the terms to pronounce, write, and read. For all these reasons, its use may increase in scientific literature...|$|E

I have researched both local Geology of the Saitama Prefecture in addition to several areas of Japanese Islands, and Micropaleontology, especially on larger benthic Foraminifera. I have researched Geosciences in the Department of Geology, Faculty of Education, Saitama University. Because Saitama University was reformed into 5 Faculties, and Department of Geology, Faculty of Science was re-organized to belong to Faculty of Education. This reform since 1969 did considerable damage to the research of Geosciences, because of great loss of the fundamental support of finance, fellowship and equipment. I would, however, continue to work after retirement to contribute {{in the field of}} Geosciences with the great endeavor, just like as Prof. Jan B.

40|$|The Orowaiti Estuary {{is located}} {{east of the}} town of Westport on the west coast of the south island, New Zealand. Surface and {{sediment}} records were recovered and analysed in an attempt to identify evidence of tsunami and co – seismic subsidence in the estuary. Proxies utilised for identification were sedimentology, palaeontology and geochemistry, along with historical records for correlation. The transect representing the modern environment behaved in a manner typical of New Zealand estuarine environments. It supported a gradient of sedimentology which correlated with tidal heights. It also exhibited a number of different genera of the microbenthic <b>Foraminiferida.</b> The dominant genera observed in the transect were repeated in the core at depth, suggesting a period of either erosion or subsidence in the estuary to prevent a gradual decrease in mean water level over time. Caesium isotope dating revealed evidence of relatively shallow peaks in radioactivity in the core, placing the 1930 ’s above the suspected subsidence or flooding event influencing foraminiferal distribution. ICP – MS analysis highlighted a section of the core below this where small increases in all common pollutants, including mercury appeared. This was correlated with the middle 1800 ’s, where the gold rush was at its height. Due to bioturbation in the lower core sections, it was concluded that co – seismic subsidence was most likely responsible for the lack of speciation in the core compared to the transect. The suspected seismic event responsible was thought to be the potential 1717 Alpine Fault rupture. It was chronologically fitting, and was the only documented major rupture before the gold rush. Flooding evidence was thought to have occurred further up the core, in an undisturbed, sand dominated section that could be correlated to a 1979 avulsion of the Buller River into the Orowaiti. No evidence was found the supported the occurrence of tsunami in the Orowaiti estuary...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Foraminiferida</b> {{represents}} one order of single-celled protists that live {{either on the}} sea floor (benthic) or within the surface water column (planktonic) of marine environments. The soft tissue (protoplasm) of foraminiferal cell is largely enclosed within a test mainly composed of secreted calcite minerals. This protozoan evolved a planktonic mode {{of life in the}} Middle Jurrasic in a neritic environment. The first morphologic prolification occurred in Albian time. The pattern of evolution in shell morphology can be viewed as the best example of iterative evolution. The three shell construction modes of Cretaceous, Paleogene and Neogene forms occurred during the time period from Cretaceous to Recent. The narrow adaptive temperature ranges of planktonic species have become useful tools in oceanographic studies. The nine living bioprovinces and three depth habitats are recognized worldwide. The living plankton foraminifers are divided into non-spinose and spinose categories, with subcategories based on other shell wall structures. These two groups differ from each other in such ecological features as depth habitats, presence of algal symbiont, trophic activity and reproduction cycle. More detailed sediment trap investigations of one or several year duration revealed a pattern of production and seasonal occurrence of each living plankton species. Many trap studies suggest a hypothesis that the subsurface-dwelling species become abundant when shoaling of thermocline occurs. The upwelling of nutrient rich, cool water available for primary production is related to shoaling of thermocline, which eventually controls the productivity in the overlying waters. For the past geologic interval, especially that of Quaternary, coiling ratios and species compositions of selected species have been used as a proxy of reconstructing paleotemperature. Furthermore, geochemical signals of oxygen-carbon isotopes and trace elements recorded in foraminiferal calcite shells provide an important tool for deducing such past oceanic conditions as nutrient, seawater temperature and discharge of river flux. The statistical analysis of faunal assemblages is, however, still a powerful method for the pre-Pleistocene time period because a potential for diagenetic alteration increases exponentially...|$|E

Dashed line represents half-interval contours. Datum is mean sea level. One hundred twenty-seven species of Upper Cretaceous <b>Foraminiferida</b> were recovered from a sandstone-siltstone sequence in Letterbox Canyon southeast of Carlsbad, San Diego County, California. This rich fauna offers a new evaluation to the Campanian-Maestrichtian boundary in the sedimentary rocks of the Southern California Coastal Plain. These Upper Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are temporarily assigned to the Rosario Formation of Baja California, Mexico. In Letterbox Canyon, they lie nonconformably on the Lower Cretaceous Green Valley Tonalite of the crystalline basement complex and are overlain unconformably by the sandstones of the Eocene Delmar Formation. Two distinct faunules are established from the Rosario beds. The Frondicularia goldfussi faunule which is late Campanian in age, and the Nodosarella gracillima faunule which is early Maestrichtian. The Nodosarella gracillima faunule is correlated with the Globotruncana fornicata-Globotruncana tricarinata assemblagezone of the Navesink Formation of the New Jersey coastal plain. It is also correlated with the uppermost beds of the Navarro group from the Gulf coastal area and with formations from Australia, Tunisia, Puerto Rico, and Trinidad B. W. I. The basin of deposition {{is thought to have}} been topographically restricted. The samples taken appear to represent sites located approximately 4, 000 feet off shore on a basin floor sloping 5 ?? or less. During the Upper Campanian the basin is considered to have been located on the inner continental shelf with waters of normal marine salinity having surface temperatures of 20 ?? centigrade, and depths of 50 - 80 meters. During the Lower Maestrichtian the basin was located on the central continental shelf with deeper (80 - 100 meters) and colder (16 ?? centigrade) waters of normal marine salinity...|$|E
