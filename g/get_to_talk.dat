Obama {{said that he would}} only visit Cuba if he could meet with Cuban dissidents: [...] "If I go on a visit, then part of the deal is that I <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to everybody.

2500|$|U.S. sources told The Washington Post in 1985 {{that the}} LaRouche {{organization}} had assembled a worldwide network {{of government and}} military contacts, and that his researchers sometimes supplied information to government officials. Bobby Ray Inman, the CIA's deputy director in 1981 and 1982, said LaRouche {{and his wife had}} visited him offering information about the West German Green Party, and a CIA spokesman said LaRouche met Deputy Director John McMahon in 1983 to discuss one of LaRouche's trips overseas. An aide to William Clark said when LaRouche's associates discussed technology or economics, they made good sense and seemed to be qualified. Norman Bailey, formerly with the National Security Council, said in 1984 that LaRouche's staff comprised [...] "one of the best private intelligence services in the world[...] [...] [...] They do {{know a lot of people}} around the world. They do <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to prime ministers and presidents." [...] Several government officials feared a security leak from the government's ties with the movement.|$|E

But she starts to have real {{feelings}} for him. Miley then has {{to listen to her}} heart and chose the guy who could [...] "be the one." [...] She ends up choosing Jake over Jesse. In the season 4 episode [...] "Been Here All Along", She goes out on a date with Jesse (as Miley), but gets angry when he took a phone call from his father, since she blow off her [...] "father- daughter day" [...] with her dad, but when Jesse tells her that he took the call because his dad is stationed in Afghanistan and they don't <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> often, Miley is inspired to hold a concert as Hannah for military families. In another episode in the 4th season Miley reveals to Jesse that she is Hannah. Yet to her surprise he already knows. Jesse can't take the pressure of dating Hannah and Miley and ends it with Miley. In the end of the episode, Jesse comes back to Miley and then she reveals her secret to the whole world.|$|E

A neighbour of that kind in the country exercises so large an influence upon the whole tenor of one's life, that to abstain from such talk {{is out of the}} question. Mrs. Robarts had been brought up almost under the dowager's wing, and of course she regarded her as being worthy of much talking.

6000|$|Fulkerson was {{extremely}} {{proud of the}} number; {{but he said it}} was too good--too good from every point of view. The cover was too good, and the paper was too good, and that device of rough edges, which got over the objection to uncut leaves while it secured their aesthetic effect, was a thing that he trembled for, though he rejoiced in it as a stroke of the highest genius. It had come from Beaton at the last moment, as a compromise, when the problem of the vulgar croppiness of cut leaves and the unpopularity of uncut leaves seemed to have no solution but suicide. Fulkerson was still morally crawling round on his hands and knees, as he said, in abject gratitude at Beaton's feet, though he had his qualms, his questions; and he declared that Beaton was the most inspired ass since Balaam's. [...] "We're all asses, of course," [...] he admitted, in semi-apology to March; [...] "but we're no such asses as Beaton." [...] He said that if the tasteful decorativeness of the thing did not kill it with the public outright, its literary excellence would give it the finishing stroke. Perhaps that might be overlooked in the impression of novelty which a first number would give, but it must never happen again. He implored March to promise that it should never happen again; he said their only hope was in the immediate cheapening of the whole affair. It was bad enough to give the public too much quantity for their money, but to throw in such quality as that was simply ruinous; it must be stopped. These were the expressions of his intimate moods; every front that he presented to the public wore a glow of lofty, of devout exultation. His pride in the number gushed out in fresh bursts of rhetoric to every one whom he could <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with him about it. He worked the personal kindliness of the press to the utmost. He did not mind making himself ridiculous or becoming a joke in the good cause, as he called it. He joined in the applause when a humorist at the club feigned to drop dead from his chair at Fulkerson's introduction of the topic, and he went on talking that first number into the surviving spectators. He stood treat upon all occasions, and he lunched attaches of the press at all hours. He especially befriended the correspondents of the newspapers of other cities, for, as he explained to March, those fellows could give him any amount of advertising simply as literary gossip. Many of the fellows were ladies who could not be so summarily asked out to lunch, but Fulkerson's ingenuity was equal to every exigency, and he contrived somehow to make each of these feel that she had been possessed of exclusive information. There was a moment when March conjectured a willingness in Fulkerson to work Mrs. March into the advertising department, by means of a tea to these ladies and their friends which she should administer in his apartment, but he did not encourage Fulkerson to be explicit, and the moment passed. Afterward, when he told his wife about it, he was astonished to find that she would not have minded doing it for Fulkerson, and he experienced another proof of the bluntness of the feminine instincts in some directions, and of the personal favor which Fulkerson seemed to enjoy with the whole sex. This alone was enough to account for the willingness of these correspondents to write about the first number, but March accused him of sending it to their addresses with boxes of Jacqueminot roses and Huyler candy.|$|E
