500|$|Moa {{stated that}} [...] "this {{is the first}} album that I really thought about what I wanted ... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> [...] simple in structure, concentrating on the {{layering}} of vocals and guitars." [...] With Love in Motion, Moa moved away from her traditional pop and country pop sound to a pop rock environment. She intentionally changed the sound, through alterations in production and engineering, rather than the writing style. Moa told co-producer Andre Upston that she wanted the album to sound [...] "dirty and gritty." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Faith Won't Fail" [...] was {{inspired}} by faith always sufficing in Bible situations and chapters; and Hudson commented on [...] "Search Me": [...] "I was struggling {{with the fact that}} I would have the huge responsibility of how others would be affected through what I was doing or saying on stage. I don't want to put on some kind of front that everything is good when it's not. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it real, but still give people hope." [...] The record closes with [...] "When There's Nothing Left", which {{has been described as a}} [...] "crisp and clean 'love note' to God". The album was described as not being in the vein of the bubble gum pop variety rather evoking comparisons to the Christian pop songstresses Rachel Lampa and Jaci Velasquez.|$|E
500|$|What was not {{publicly}} known {{during the regular}} season and playoffs was that Smith had torn his rotator cuff after suffering an impingement in his right shoulder during the July 11–14 homestand against the Padres. After suffering the impingement diving back into first base on a pickoff throw, Smith altered his throwing motion {{to such a degree that}} the rotator cuff tear subsequently developed. The 5'10" [...] (1.78m), 180-pound (82kg) Smith opted to forgo surgery and instead built up his arm strength via weightlifting, playing through whatever pain he encountered. Said Smith, [...] "I didn't tell anybody about the injury, because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> playing and didn't want anybody thinking they could run on me or take advantage of the injury. I tried to do almost everything, except throw a baseball, left-handed: opening a door, turning on the radio—everything. It didn't get any better, but it was good enough that I didn't have to have surgery." ...|$|E

500|$|Aaliyah, who {{maintained}} a perfect 4.0 {{grade point average}} when graduating from Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, felt education was important. She saw fit to keep her grades up despite the pressures and time constraints brought on her during the early parts of her career. She labeled herself as a perfectionist and recalled always being a good student. Aaliyah reflected: [...] "I always wanted to maintain that, even in high school when I first started to travel. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> that 4.0. Being in the industry, you know, I don't want kids to think, 'I can just sing and forget about school.' I think it's very important to have an education, and even more important {{to have something to}} fall back on." [...] She did this in her own life, as she planned to [...] "fall back on" [...] another part of the entertainment industry. She believed that if she could teach music history or open her own school to teach that or drama if she did not make a living as a recording artist because, as she reasoned, [...] "when you pick a career it has to be something you love".|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Reznor {{successfully}} completed rehab, and eventually moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles. In a 2005 interview with Kerrang, he reflected on his self-destructive past: [...] "There was a persona that had run its course. I {{needed to get}} my priorities straight, my head screwed on. Instead of always working, I {{took a couple of}} years off, just to figure out who I was and working out if <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> doing this or not. I had become a terrible addict; I needed to get my shit together, figure out what had happened." [...] In contrast to his former suicidal tendencies, he admitted in another interview that he is [...] "pretty happy". Nine Inch Nails' next full-length album, With Teeth (2005), reached number one on the Billboard 200.|$|E
2500|$|Lucas {{finished}} {{writing his}} script in March 1976, when the crew started filming. He said, [...] "What finally emerged through the many drafts {{of the script}} has obviously been influenced by science-fiction and action-adventure I've read and seen. And I've {{seen a lot of}} it. I'm trying to make a classic sort of genre picture, a classic space fantasy in which all the influences are working together. There are certain traditional aspects of the genre <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> and help perpetuate in Star Wars." [...] During production, he changed Luke's name from Starkiller to Skywalker and altered the title to The Star Wars and later Star Wars. He would also continue to tweak the script during filming, including adding the death of Obi-Wan after realizing he served no purpose in the ending of the film.|$|E

2500|$|Detainees were terrorized by the {{treatment}} of fellow detainees. [...] A military doctor amputated both legs of a Saudi detainee named Abdul Rahman because of frostbite. Kurnaz watched from the neighboring cage as soldiers beat the legless man's fingers off the chain link fence {{when he tried to}} pull himself up to sit on his toilet-bucket. [...] Dragged out for interrogations with his stumps dangling, he would return with his face bloodied from beatings. Another had frostbite on one finger and a military surgeon amputated all his fingers, leaving only his thumbs. A third complained of a toothache and the dentist pulled his healthy teeth. Wounds and fractured limbs, including fingers broken during interrogations, were left untreated. Kurnaz's health suffered over the years but he [...] "tried to avoid being taken to the doctor at all costs. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my teeth, fingers, and legs." ...|$|E

My intention was to start fast but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> going a bit longer than I did. I maybe got over excited and a went too fast, but I maintained the time difference {{and so it was}} all ok." [...] This race was the seasons' main goal for Van Dijk. She had been tested on her time trial position during the season and found a better position which she was able to maintain for almost half an hour. Van Dijk told she practiced the course twice in August at 5:00am to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course {{to get to know the}} turns. She had watched the video over and over again until she could dream it.|$|E
2500|$|Prescott {{has been}} {{involved}} in a number of controversies and incidents that have caused public concern and widespread media interest. During the 2001 election campaign, Prescott was campaigning in Rhyl, Denbighshire when farmer Craig Evans threw an egg at him, which struck him in the neck. Prescott, a former amateur boxer, responded immediately with a straight left to the jaw. The incident, overshadowing the launch of the Labour Party manifesto on that day, was captured by numerous television crews. Tony Blair responded succinctly, stating, [...] "John is John". A National Opinion Polls (NOP) survey found that the incident appeared to do no public harm to Prescott, and may even have benefited his standing amongst male voters. The incident {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "Rumble in Rhyl". Speaking on Top Gear, Prescott noted that [...] "I was against fox-hunting, and he thought I was one of the guys he hated because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> fox-hunting".

[...] "Things had gotten dysfunctional and not fun, even though I thought we were making great records, doing great shows and were a really powerful, mighty thing as a band.

[...] "For me, the biggest thing during the time off, and what really made me want to continue doing the band, specifically after decided he didn't want to continue in the band anymore, [...] I just realized, Anthony, man, he's my brother, I love him so much, and we started this band when we were kids. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> that going, I never want to let that go. Playing with him is something, even though I can do other things that are exciting and beautiful and I always will do those things and I'll always want to grow and do music outside of the band, the thing that we have is special to us and something that is blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, {{some weeks}} after her {{unsuccessful}} audition for Geena Gregory, Jones was contacted by Coronation Street bosses, who {{offered her a}} part of a new character. Jones took on the role of Karen Phillips (no relation to Mandy), making her first appearance on 21 June. The character, after marrying Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), took on his surname, and became Karen McDonald. Described as [...] "a bulldog in hoop earrings" [...] and a [...] "Victoria Beckham wannabe", the role garnered Jones public attention, with episodes involving feuds between her and rival Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) receiving millions of viewers; the episode featuring Karen and Steve's (second) wedding, ruined by Tracy Barlow's revelation that her daughter Amy Barlow was Steve's love child, received 16.3 million viewers. Jones also began modelling for men's magazines such as FHM and Loaded, saying: [...] "I was 21, and within three weeks of me joining Corrie I was in Barbados doing a bikini shoot [...] I was quite impressionable and I'd just say yes to everything because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my job.
