5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics,</b> that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E

2500|$|Hoping {{to harness}} the ample power of the Merrimack River, another group of investors began {{building}} the Middlesex Canal up the Mystic River, both Mystic Lakes and generally following stream valleys (near to today's MA 38) reached the Merrimack in Chelmsford [...] from Boston Harbor, establishing limited operations by 1808, and a system of navigations and canals reaching past Manchester by mid-1814 [...] and spawning commercial activities, and especially new clothing mills throughout the region. [...] At nearly {{the same time as}} the canal was completed, Francis Cabot Lowell and a consortium of businessmen set up the clothing mills in Waltham, Massachusetts making use of water power from the Charles River with the concept of housing together production of feedstocks complete consumer processes so raw materials entered, and <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> or clothing left. For a few decades, it seemed that every lock along the canal had mills and water wheels. [...] In 1821, [...] Boston Manufacturing Company built a major expansion in East Chelmsford, which was soon incorporated as Lowell, Massachusetts [...] which came to dominate the cloth production and clothing industry for decades.|$|E

50|$|Cross dyeing is “a {{method of}} dyeing blend or {{combination}} fabrics {{to two or}} more shades {{by the use of}} dyes with different affinities for the different fibers”. The cross dyeing process can be used to create heather effects, and plaid, check, or striped fabrics. Cross <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> may be mistaken for fiber or yarn dyed materials as the fabric is not a solid color, a characteristic considered typical of piece <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics.</b> It is not possible to visually differentiate between cross <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> and those dyed at the fiber or yarn stage. An example is cross dyeing blue worsted wool fabric with polyester pin stripes. When dyed, the wool yarns are dyed blue, whereas the polyester yarns remain white.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fabric</b> <b>dyeing,</b> {{also known}} as piece <b>dyeing,</b> is <b>dyeing</b> <b>fabric</b> {{after it has been}} constructed. It is {{economical}} and the most common method of <b>dyeing</b> solid colored <b>fabrics.</b> The decision regarding color can be made after the fabric has been manufactured. Thus, it is suitable for quick response orders. Dye penetration may not be good in thicker <b>fabrics,</b> so yarn <b>dyeing</b> is sometimes used to <b>dye</b> thick <b>fabrics</b> in solid colors. Various types of dyeing machines are used for piece dyeing. The selection of the equipment is based on factors such as <b>dye</b> and <b>fabric</b> characteristics, cost, and the intended end use.|$|R

50|$|The {{first use}} of {{diazonium}} salts was to produce water-fast <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> by immersing the fabric in an aqueous solution of the diazonium compound, followed by immersion in a solution of the coupler (the electron-rich ring that undergoes electrophilic substitution). The major applications of diazonium compounds remains in the dye and pigment industry.|$|E
50|$|The {{low water}} {{solubility}} {{is the basis}} of the good wash-fastness of these <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics.</b> These dyes have good all round fastness except to chlorine bleaches. Because the dye is water-insoluble, it will not bleed when washed in water and will not stain other clothes. The dye, however, may have poor fastness to rubbing. The dyes are bleached by hypochlorite bleach.|$|E
30|$|The {{evaluation}} of the color parameter and the color difference of <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> samples was performed by using CIELab system. The lightness value of color (from 100 to 0) is represented by L*; a higher lightness value indicates a lower color yield by the <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric.</b> Again, a* and b* values characterize {{the tone of the}} color; positive values of a* and b* stand for redder and yellower tones, while negative values show greener and bluer tones (Kuehni 2003).|$|R

30|$|Negligible {{deviation}} {{among the}} colour coordinate values indicates excellent shade matching. The highest tolerance limit for colour difference, dE {{in the industry}} is generally 1 and hence the samples with the value of dE[*]≤[*] 1 are considered to have PASSED or else it is FAILED (Tayade and Adivarekar 2013). The natural indigo <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> which showed the colour coordinate values {{much closer to the}} synthetic indigo <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> was considered to be the best match. It is found that <b>fabric</b> <b>dyed</b> with 150 % of crude indigo dye matches with the <b>fabric</b> <b>dyed</b> with 2 % shade of synthetic indigo dye which was taken as standard with dE of 0.825. The exceptionally higher % shade was required for matching as commercial synthetic indigo is pure product whit purity over 90 % (Vuorema 2008) whereas it is not so in case of crude indigo dye which is extracted from natural source.|$|R

Modern materials like crayons, dyes or <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics,</b> acrylic paints and artificial colouring agents are also becoming common, allowing for brilliant and vibrant colour choices. A newer but less artificial method involves using cement coloured with marble powder. This rather precise method requires training, but beautiful portraits can be drawn in this medium.|$|E

Bill in 1944, craft and arts came together on college campuses across the nation. Counts was heir to two historic traditions, that of medieval Germany and Japan, including apprenticeship, hands on learning, practical and functional design and good workmanship. These ethics and aesthetics applied equally to the other art forms in which Counts worked. Counts' [...] "discipleship" [...] following his apprenticeship with Marguerite Wildenhain shows clearly with stark realistic representation of natural images used for three dimensional motifs on pots. Counts translated his motifs from nature on three dimensional pots to two dimensional murals created with ceramic [...] "tiles" [...] to tufted rugs and quilt designs, He adopted applique forms with curving lines of quilting stitches, frames of color unifying his quilt and images on batik <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics,</b> Counts took advantage of products of local fabric mills and developed a partnership with the Rising Fawn Quilters, traditional Appalachian craftspeople who brought needlework skill that complemented the non-traditional character of Count's designs. Counts bemoaned the fact that established designs had creates a loss of creativity in traditional quilts. His designs were very different from traditional geometric quilts. After the [...] "sandwich" [...] of quilt top, wadding or batting and the backing fabric were placed into the quilting frame and the quilt was rolled around the side bars of the quilting frame making the center of the quilt accessible. Then Counts drew the quilting design directly on the exposed area of fabric of the center of the top using a ballpoint pen. As each section was completed the quilt was unrolled and Counts continued to mark the design on the exposed section.|$|E
