25|$|The Sydney Ghost Train {{fire was}} a fire {{on the night of}} 9 June 1979 at Luna Park Sydney. The fire killed six {{children}} and one adult, and destroyed the amusement park's ghost train. Inadequate <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>measures</b> and low staffing caused the fire to completely destroy the ride, which was first constructed in 1931, and had been transported from Glenelg, South Australia to Milsons Point, New South Wales during 1934 and 1935.|$|E

When a Japanese bomb exploded among his group, he successfully undertook <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>measures</b> despite having received mortal wounds. For this act, Ricketts was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{cable tunnel}} fire spreads rapidly, the {{high-temperature}} toxic smog accumulates, {{and the fire}} fighting is of great difficulties. Once the fire hazard occurs, serious economic losses and casualties will be caused. Through the numerical simulation of the cable tunnel fire process, and the analysis and summary of simulation results, conclusions are drawn of flue gas spread situation and the section temperature changes during the generating process of cable tunnel fires. Then the best fire fighting time is proposed, which provides references for development of <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>measures</b> and selection of the fire protection system...|$|E
40|$|Move {{the exposed}} person {{to fresh air}} at once. Provide rest, warmth and fresh air. INGESTION Rinse mouth thoroughly. Get medical attention. SKIN CONTACT Wash the skin {{immediately}} with soap and water. Get medical attention if irritation persists after washing. EYE CONTACT Make sure to remove any contact lenses from the eyes before rinsing. Promptly wash eyes with plenty of water while lifting the eye lids. Continue to rinse for at least 15 minutes. Get medical attention if any discomfort continues. 5 <b>FIRE-FIGHTING</b> <b>MEASURE...</b>|$|R
40|$|The EU’s October summit was {{dominated}} by one issue; the migration and refugee crisis, with EU leaders intent on putting on a public display of unity after weeks of bitter arguments, and concentrating on <b>fire-fighting</b> and immediate <b>measures</b> to tackle the most pressing reasons for, and impacts of, the crisis. Longer-term measures {{to address some of}} the root causes of increased migratory flows, support for the integration of newly arrived refugees or the introduction of new channels of legal migration, were not discussed. The Summit also spent little time on two issues that had originally been expected to be {{a key part of the}} agenda: the forthcoming British referendum on EU membership, where irritation with the slow pace of talks and British vagueness about its demands were in evidence; and the governance of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), where EU leaders missed another opportunity for a thorough debate about future perspectives on the basis of the ‘Five Presidents’ Report’...|$|R
40|$|The {{designation}} status, {{general aspects}} and fire characteristics of 159 important wooden cultural assets designated as national treasurers were reviewed in this study. And, the access roads for fire trucks, mobilization time and distance of fire trucks, and establishment status of fire trees and fire lines among the external fire-fighting environmental elements surrounding the important wooden cultural assets were analyzed through the actual condition survey of important wooden cultural assets {{to draw any}} exist-ing problems. Through this study, the improvement schemes for <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>measures</b> in future were presented...|$|E
40|$|Part 2 : Knowledge-Based ServicesInternational audienceThe {{purpose is}} to {{describe}} the essential components and output of the tactical planning process and to explore context-related variations in {{the applicability of the}} planning process for hospital departments. The paper is based on a multiple-case study of three hospital departments’ planning processes at a tactical level, wherein the department manager’s support of the planning process was found to be essential. This study illustrates how an active tactical planning process can provide for numerous potential measures to adjust capacity and how they may vary in different contexts. An active tactical planning process provides the ability to move from current short-term, costly <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>measures</b> to more proactive capacity adjustments within hospital departments, which allow the department to stay under budget while keeping waiting times and queues within limits...|$|E
