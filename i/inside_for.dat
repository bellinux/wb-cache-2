5|$|Inspector Altieri {{arrives at}} the house and Neal kills her. Giermani and Anne arrive soon afterwards; when Neal sees that he cannot escape, he slits his throat in front of them. Finding the {{telephone}} out of order, Giermani and Anne go outside to report the incident from the car radio. Giermani returns {{to the house and}} is murdered by Neal, who had faked his own death. Neal waits <b>inside</b> <b>for</b> Anne to return, but when she opens the door, she accidentally knocks over a metal sculpture that impales and kills Neal. The horror-stricken Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly.|$|E
5|$|The {{company also}} shot at Hoover Dam {{and at the}} Pentagon, {{the first time since}} the September 11 attacks that film crews had been allowed at these locations. The {{external}} Hoover Dam scenes were shot before tourists arrived daily at 10:00a.m., with shooting moving <b>inside</b> <b>for</b> the remainder of the day. Production in California was based at Hughes Aircraft at Playa Vista, where the hangar in which Megatron is imprisoned was built. Six weekends were spent in Los Angeles, California shooting the climactic battle, with some elements being shot on the Universal Studios backlot and at Detroit's Michigan Central Station. The crew was allowed to shoot at Griffith Observatory, which was still closed for renovations begun in 2002. Filming wrapped on October 4, 2006.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Tom (Shearsmith), a primary school teacher, apathetically marking work while chatting {{to his girlfriend}} Gerri (Arterton), {{who is going to}} {{audition}} for a part in a play. Tom complains about a tramp begging outside their house. Later in the evening, Tom is home alone and Migg (Pemberton), the tramp, comes to his door, to return Tom's wallet. Tom rewards him with £40. Migg comes back later with a bottle of whiskey for Tom. Reluctantly, Tom invites Migg <b>inside</b> <b>for</b> a drink. Migg says he knew Charles Bukowski, whom Tom as an aspiring author idolises, and Tom warms to Migg as they drink.|$|E
5|$|An iron hook is affixed {{into the}} wall of the Castellania close to the pillory. According to tradition, the hook might have been used to lift the largest bell of the nearby Saint John's Co-Cathedral, but this is now {{regarded}} as unlikely. The hook was most probably used to secure prisoners to the Castellania's pillory. In 1803, Horatio Nelson allegedly passed through the hook in a dare, and the hook became known as Nelson's Hook after the Battle of Trafalgar. It became a tradition for Royal Navy sailors to bet and buy drinks for shipmates who managed to pass through the hook. Junior officers allegedly had a good chance of promotion if they passed through the hook. Brockman further claims that the hook was used to lift a cage at the pillory, with a person condemned to stay <b>inside</b> <b>for</b> public ridicule, allegedly another type of public degradation. The hook by itself is a sought after landmark; it is often found marked on modern contemporary maps and included on tourists booklets.|$|E
5|$|Franchitti {{gained the}} lead and held it at the lap-180 restart. Junqueira {{attempted}} to pass Servià around the <b>inside</b> <b>for</b> fourth position {{but was unable to}} get ahead. Carpentier attempted to pressure da Matta {{towards the end of the}} race but it was difficult to overtake and he did not want to be very aggressive and run off the racing line. Vasser set the race's fastest lap during the 210th (and penultimate) lap, competing a circuit of 25.217 seconds. Franchitti maintained the lead for the remainder of the race and crossed the start-finish line after 211 laps to win the race. Da Matta was second, ahead of Carpentier in third, Servià was fourth and Junqueira fifth. Takagi, Vasser, Bräck, Manning, and Andretti rounded out the top ten finishers. Jourdain, Dixon, and Domínguez were the last of the classified finishers. It was Franchitti's third (and final) victory of the season, his first win on an oval track in CART, and the tenth (and final) of his career. There were nine lead changes in the race; four drivers reached the front of the field. Bräck's total of 134 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Franchitti led three times, for a total of 58 laps.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{set a new}} fastest lap of {{the race}} on lap 47 to reduce the time deficit to Vettel to 7.9 seconds. Petrov began to {{challenge}} de la Rosa for 12th place on the same lap. Hülkenberg's right rear tyre delaminated on lap 50, causing damage to his car's exhaust system and became the race's final retirement. Kobayashi made his only pit stop of the event on lap 53 and rejoined in ninth position behind Alonso. Button was worried about a possible post-race time penalty and pushed hard to record the overall fastest lap of the race, a 1:38.766, on the 54th lap. Alonso challenged Buemi for seventh place on lap 55 {{but was unable to}} pass him. Kobayashi ran closely behind Alonso and passed him around the <b>inside</b> <b>for</b> eighth when Alonso ran wide at turn 17 on the following lap. Buemi was overtaken by Kobayashi at the final corner on the last lap of the race to clinch seventh.|$|E
5|$|Abt fell to seventh {{when he was}} {{overtaken}} by Prost at the first corner on lap ten, and the former defended from a large pack of cars. By the twelfth lap, Buemi had more usable electrical energy available and closed up to Piquet, overtaking him around the <b>inside</b> <b>for</b> fourth position at the seventh turn. Félix da Costa's vehicle stopped at turn eight on lap twelve. However, the deployment of a full course yellow flag was avoided when he received radio instructions from his team to perform a full reset, enabling him to rejoin the race. By then, he had dropped {{to the back of}} the field, and later became the race's first retirement. Upfront, Rosenqvist held a five-second advantage over Bird by the fourteenth lap, but the latter was being caught by Vergne by more than four-tenths of a second per lap. Although he had less electrical energy, Vergne caught Bird, who had been backed into Buemi, and moved in front of him at the start of the 16th lap with Bird electing not to defend the second position. The mandatory pit stops, during which all drivers need to change into a second car, began on the same lap. When Rosenqvist and Vergne entered the pit lane Buemi and Bird elected to remain on the circuit for another lap. Buemi was running quicker and overtook Bird at turn eleven on lap 17. He braked late for turn eleven but avoided going off the circuit. Piquet was affected by an electrical problem, ending his chances of finishing in a points-scoring position. Engel stopped his vehicle after making his pit stop, and became the event's second retirement with electrical problems. After the pit stops, Rosenqvist regained the first position, retaining most of his four-second advantage over Vergne. Di Grassi had been passed by Turvey but reclaimed sixth place from him shortly afterwards and started to close up to teammate Abt.|$|E
