5|$|Marx {{continued}} to write articles for the New York Daily Tribune {{as long as}} he was sure that the Tribune's <b>editorial</b> <b>policy</b> was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new <b>editorial</b> <b>policy.</b> No longer was the Tribune to be a strong abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the Tribune.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study done}} in 1927, the Dewey system {{was used in the}} US in {{approximately}} 96% of responding public libraries and 89% of the college libraries. After the death of Melvil Dewey in 1931, administration of the classification was under the Decimal Classification Committee of the Lake Placid Club Education Foundation, and the editorial body was the Decimal Classification <b>Editorial</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee with participation of the American Library Association (ALA), Library of Congress, and Forest Press. By the 14th edition in 1942, the Dewey Decimal Classification index was over 1,900 pages in length and was published in two volumes.|$|E

25|$|Founded in 1986, the magazine's <b>editorial</b> <b>policy</b> {{was shaped}} by Nan Fink Gefen, Michael Lerner, and Peter Gabel. According to the {{founding}} editorial statement, political concerns of the 1960s civil rights, anti-war, and feminist movements and psychological studies of workers in the 1970s and 1980s were their most direct influences. Among authors who contributed to the magazine's interfaith character were the historian Christopher Lasch, philosopher Cornel West, and Harvey Cox of Harvard Divinity School.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Al Jazeera channel {{was launched}} 1 November 1996 by an emiri decree with a loan of 500 million Qatari riyals (US$137million) from the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa. By its funding through loans or grants rather than direct government subsidies, the channel claims to maintain independent <b>editorial</b> <b>policy.</b> The channel began broadcasting in late 1996, with many staff joining from the BBC World Service's Saudi-co-owned Arabic-language TV station, which had shut down on 1 April 1996 {{after two years}} of operation because of censorship demands by the Saudi Arabian government.|$|E

50|$|Boddy’s <b>editorial</b> <b>policies</b> {{in these}} early years {{established}} the Daily News as the city’s only liberal journalistic voice.After the end of World War II, Boddy’s interest in the newspaper began to wane. His efforts to stimulate interest in various plans to boost the country’s economy and his crusades for noble causes had ended with the war. Los Angeles had become a mecca for job-seekers and a refuge for new arrivals from the frozen East Coast. Postwar Los Angeles was emerging as an increasingly cosmopolitan city, and many of Boddy’s <b>editorial</b> <b>policies</b> seemed quaint to the city’s new residents.|$|R

Participants included Philip Wickeri, Edmond Tang, Arne Sovik, and Bob Whyte. The {{members of this group}} published several periodicals, including Bridge, Religion in the People’s Republic of China, and Ching Feng, which reprinted TSPM documents and statements and generally followed an <b>editorial</b> <b>policy</b> sympathetic to the TSPM’s viewpoint.|$|E
25|$|As {{editors and}} contributors, Buckley {{especially}} sought out intellectuals who were ex-Communists or had once {{worked on the}} far Left, including Whittaker Chambers, William Schlamm, John Dos Passos, Frank Meyer and James Burnham. When James Burnham {{became one of the}} original senior editors he urged the adoption of a more pragmatic editorial position that would extend the influence of the magazine toward the political center. Smant (1991) finds that Burnham overcame sometimes heated opposition from other members of the editorial board (including Meyer, Schlamm, William Rickenbacker, and the magazine's publisher William A. Rusher), and {{had a significant impact on}} both the <b>editorial</b> <b>policy</b> of the magazine and on the thinking of Buckley himself.|$|E
25|$|The analyst {{went on to}} {{note the}} absence of {{coverage}} of the subject in the Soviet press, which it was felt could only represent a policy position and highlighted the “question of why and {{of whether or not}} these sightings could be used from a psychological warfare point of view either offensively or defensively. Air Force is aware of this and had investigated a number of the civilian groups that have sprung up to follow the subject. One - the Civilian Saucer Committee in California has substantial funds, strongly influences the <b>editorial</b> <b>policy</b> of a number of newspapers and has leaders whose connections may be questionable. Air Force is watching this organization because of its power to touch off mass hysteria and panic. Perhaps we, from an intelligence point of view, should watch for any indication of Russian efforts to capitalize upon this present American credulity.|$|E

25|$|Governor Grey had {{to contend}} with {{newspapers}} that were unequivocal to their support of the interests of the settlers: the Auckland Times, Auckland Chronicle, The Southern Cross, which started by William Brown as a weekly paper in 1843 and The New Zealander, which was started in 1845 by John Williamson. These newspapers were known for their partisan editorial policies – both William Brown and John Williamson were aspiring politicians. The Southern Cross supported the land claimants, such as the New Zealand Company, and vigorously attacked Governor Grey's administration, while The New Zealander, supported the ordinary settler and the Māori. The northern war adversely affected business in Auckland, such that The Southern Cross stopped publishing from April 1845 to July 1847. Hugh Carleton, who also became a politician, was the editor of The New Zealander then later established the Anglo-Maori Warder, which followed an <b>editorial</b> <b>policy</b> in opposition to Governor Grey.|$|E
25|$|Filipescu {{was again}} in Bucharest during the {{resumption}} {{of war and the}} period leading up to Germany's surrender. His father had founded Epoca newspaper in 1885, and in September 1918, the son decided to revive the moribund outfit, buying the trademark from its nominal owner, Timoleon Pisani. Filipescu and Constantin Argetoianu identified two financiers, Aristide Blank and Jean Chrissoveloni. In exchange for backing from the latter two, the newspaper owners joined the administration of Marmorosch Blank Bank, alongside Duca, Toma Stelian, and Alexandru Vaida-Voevod. Blank's involvement would fuel the suspicions of antisemitic groups that the newspaper was a tool of the Jews. While Blank's influence was exaggerated, he did have a say in the <b>editorial</b> <b>policy.</b> For instance, when an article critical of Liviu Rebreanu was slated to appear, the financier convinced Filipescu not to run the story. Instead, in 1919 Epoca published a dossier on Marghiloman's wartime stances.|$|E
25|$|The daily {{newspaper}} in Nashville is The Tennessean, which until 1998 competed with the Nashville Banner, another daily paper that was {{housed in the}} same building under a joint-operating agreement. The Tennessean is the city's most widely circulated newspaper. Online news service NashvillePost.com competes with the printed dailies to break local and state news. Several weekly papers are also published in Nashville, including The Nashville Pride, Nashville Business Journal, Nashville Scene and The Tennessee Tribune. Historically, The Tennessean was associated with a broadly liberal <b>editorial</b> <b>policy,</b> while The Banner carried staunchly conservative views in its editorial pages; The Banners heritage had been carried on, to an extent, by The City Paper which folded in August 2013 after having been founded in October 2000. The Nashville Scene is the area's alternative weekly broadsheet. The Nashville Pride is aimed towards community development and serves Nashville's entrepreneurial population. Nashville Post is an online news source covering business, politics and sports.|$|E
