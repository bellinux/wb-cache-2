5|$|Like its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee {{differs from}} {{traditional}} fighting games as {{the objective is}} to force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents the damage received as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to <b>knock</b> <b>off</b> the stage, which will result in the character's death and the loss of a stock, or life. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction.|$|E

25|$|At the Oval, Yorkshire Phoenix won the toss and batted. Matthew Wood {{anchored}} the innings with 111 off 127 balls, Australian Ian Harvey plundered 69 from 48, and Harvey's compatriot Phil Jaques took 49 from 39. Yorkshire {{ended on}} 334 for 5, a record score {{for them in}} the Sunday League against Surrey Lions. In reply Surrey tried to <b>knock</b> <b>off</b> their target in sixes, with 9 coming in their innings. Ali Brown scored 5 of them as he plundered 86 off 46. But wickets fell, and Surrey's specialist bowlers were not renowned for their batting abilities. When Brown was out, Surrey were 261 for 6, and still leading on Duckworth-Lewis. However, with no recognised batsmen left, only a Yorkshire victory was likely. When Mohammad Akram was stumped off a no ball, Surrey were 291 all out, 43 runs in arrears. The pick of the Yorkshire bowling was captain Craig White with 4 for 14 in 4 overs.|$|E
25|$|Popular fiction often confuses Bligh with Edward Edwards of , who {{was sent}} on the Royal Navy's {{expedition}} to the South Pacific to find the mutineers {{and bring them to}} trial. Edwards is often made out to be the cruel man that Hollywood has portrayed Bligh as being. The 14 men from Bounty who were captured by Edwards' men were confined in a cramped 18′ × 11′ × 5′8″ wooden cell on Pandoras quarterdeck. Yet, when Pandora ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, three prisoners were immediately let out of the prison cell to help at the pumps. And finally Captain Edwards did also give orders to release the other 11 prisoners, to which end Joseph Hodges the armourer's mate went into the cell to <b>knock</b> <b>off</b> the prisoners' irons. But before he could finish the job, the ship sank very quickly. Eventually four of the prisoners and 31 of the crew died during the wrecking. More prisoners would likely have perished, had not William Moulter, a bosun's mate, unlocked their cage before jumping off the sinking vessel.|$|E
25|$|England next faced South Africa in a match {{akin to a}} decider {{for which}} team was to {{progress}} to the semi finals. England batted first and were 119–6 when Nixon came to the crease, with Ravi Bopara at the other end. After making 1, he was dismissed off the bowling of Andrew Hall, caught by Mark Boucher, as his team was eventually bowled out for 154, with Hall taking 5–18 – the best ever figures for a South African at a World Cup. In South Africa's reply, they were 37–0 off four overs, compared to England's total of 5–0 at the same stage in their innings. England finally made a breakthrough in the 10th over, as Nixon caught Abraham de Villiers for 42 off the bowling of Andrew Flintoff, but South Africa already had 85 on the board. In the end, the Proteas won by nine wickets, taking just over 19 overs to <b>knock</b> <b>off</b> England's total, with captain Graeme Smith firing an unbeaten 89 off 58 deliveries, to send England crashing out of the competition.|$|E

25|$|The group {{tracks the}} masked man, who they suspect to be Krei, to an {{abandoned}} Krei Tech laboratory {{on an island}} which had been used for teleportation research until a test pilot was lost in an accident. The masked man attacks, but the group manages to <b>knock</b> <b>off</b> his mask, revealing the man to be Callaghan who had stolen Hiro's microbots to shield himself from the explosion on campus. Hiro realizes that Tadashi died without reason, while Callaghan refuses {{to take responsibility for}} Tadashi's death. This prompts an enraged Hiro to remove Baymax's healthcare chip, leaving only the battle chip, and to order him to kill Callaghan. Honey re-installs the healthcare chip at the last second, preventing Baymax from carrying out the kill order. Callaghan escapes, and Hiro leaves with Baymax, intent on avenging Tadashi. Back home, Hiro tries to remove the healthcare chip again, but Baymax stops him and states that vengeance is not what Tadashi would have wanted. To calm him down, Baymax shows Hiro videos of Tadashi running numerous tests during Baymax's development as a demonstration of Tadashi's benevolence and legacy. A remorseful Hiro apologizes to his friends, who reassure him they will catch Callaghan the right way.|$|E

500|$|The {{reason for}} the {{difficulties}} with the bell is not certain. The Whitechapel Foundry, still in business today, takes {{the position that the}} bell was either damaged in transit or was broken by an inexperienced bell ringer, who incautiously sent the clapper flying against the rim, rather than the body of the bell. In 1975, the Winterthur Museum conducted an analysis of the metal in the bell, and concluded that [...] "a series of errors made in the construction, reconstruction, and second reconstruction of the Bell resulted in a brittle bell that barely missed being broken up for scrap". The Museum found a considerably higher level of tin in the Liberty Bell than in other Whitechapel bells of that era, and suggested that Whitechapel made an error in the alloy, perhaps by using scraps {{with a high level of}} tin to begin the melt instead of the usual pure copper. The analysis found that, on the second recasting, instead of adding pure tin to the bell metal, Pass and Stow added cheap pewter with a high lead content, and incompletely mixed the new metal into the mold. The result was [...] "an extremely brittle alloy which not only caused the Bell to fail in service but made it easy for early souvenir collectors to <b>knock</b> <b>off</b> substantial trophies from the rim".|$|E
500|$|Pandora left Tahiti on 8 May 1791 {{to search}} for Christian and the Bounty among the {{thousands}} of southern Pacific islands. Apart from a few spars—which had probably floated from Tubuai—discovered at Palmerston Island (Avarau), no traces of the ship could be found. Physical attacks from natives were frequent; early in August Edwards abandoned the search {{and headed for the}} Dutch East Indies via the Torres Strait. Knowledge of these waters and the surrounding reefs was minimal; on 29 August the ship ran aground on the outer Great Barrier Reef and began to fill with water. Three of the prisoners in [...] "Pandora's Box" [...] were let out and ordered to assist the crew at the pumps. In the subsequent struggle to save the ship the rest of the men in [...] "Pandora's Box" [...] were ignored as the regular crew went about their efforts to prevent the ship from foundering. At dawn it was clear that their efforts were in vain; the officers agreed that the vessel could not be saved and orders were then given to abandon ship. The armourer was ordered into the [...] "box" [...] to <b>knock</b> <b>off</b> the remaining prisoners' leg irons and shackles; however, the ship sank before he had finished. Heywood, stripped naked, {{was one of the last}} to get out of the cell; four prisoners, including Heywood's best friend George Stewart, were drowned, as were 31 of the regular crew. The 99 survivors, including ten prisoners, recovered on a nearby island where they stayed for two nights before embarking on an open-boat journey which largely followed Bligh's course of two years earlier. The prisoners were mostly kept bound hand and foot on the slow passage to Coupang, which they reached on 17 September.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} season, both Olajuwon and Sampson were {{named to the}} Western Conference All-Stars in that year's all-star game, and the duo was nicknamed the [...] "Twin Towers". Houston won the Midwest Division title with a 51–31 record. In contrast to the other guard-oriented teams of the Western Conference, the Rockets had a high rotation on the position – John Lucas left the team 65 games into the season, Allen Leavell replaced him for twelve games before breaking his wrist, and Robert Reid took over as the starter from {{the final game of}} the regular season on. During the playoffs, the Rockets swept the Sacramento Kings before a hard-fought series with Alex English's Denver Nuggets, including one game going to double overtime in the exhausting altitude of the Mile-High City. The young squad grinded it out and eventually pulled away with the victory over the Nuggets 4–2. [...] When faced with defending champion Lakers in the Conference Finals, the Rockets were ready to <b>knock</b> <b>off</b> their rivals who had the best of them during the regular season. The Rockets, however, were blown out of Game 1 with Olajuwon's spinning reverse dunks and Sampson's alley-oops notwithstanding. Embarrassed by the loss, Olajuwon and the Rockets stormed back to shock the star-studded defending champions with 4 straight wins in an impressive four games to one series victory, a feat that no other Western Conference team had come close to doing against the Showtime Lakers. Sampson's buzzer beater that won Game 5 was described by him as [...] "the greatest moment of my basketball career". The Rockets competed in the finals {{for only the second time}} in team history, once again facing the Celtics. Boston sportswriters were not happy about not getting a shot at revenge against the Lakers who had beaten the Celtics in the Finals the year before, yet the matchup was interesting with the young front court challenging the playoff-hardened Celtics front court of Bird, McHale and Parish. The Celtics won the first two games at the Boston Garden, only for the Rockets to win two games once the series went back to Houston – a close game 3 under Sampson's leadership, and a 15 point-leading game 5 without him as he got ejected – while also losing game 4 due to late Larry Bird 3 pointers and untimely turnovers by Rockets guard Mitchell Wiggins. Game 6 went back to Boston with Sampson finding himself again in foul trouble and of little effect against the older and wiser Celtics. [...] After the series, Boston coach KC Jones called the Rockets, [...] "the new monsters on the block" [...] with the future looking very bright for the Rockets. During the six-game championship series loss against the Celtics, Sampson averaged 14.8 points on [...]438 shooting, 9.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game.|$|E
