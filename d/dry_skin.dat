5|$|Salicylic acid is a topically applied beta-hydroxy acid {{that stops}} {{bacteria}} from reproducing and has keratolytic properties. It opens obstructed skin pores and promotes shedding of epithelial skin cells. Salicylic acid {{is known to}} be less effective than retinoid therapy. <b>Dry</b> <b>skin</b> is the most commonly seen side effect with topical application, though darkening of the skin has been observed in individuals with darker skin types.|$|E
5|$|Newborn {{children}} with hypothyroidism may have normal birth weight and height (although the head may {{be larger than}} expected and the posterior fontanelle may be open). Some may have drowsiness, decreased muscle tone, a hoarse-sounding cry, feeding difficulties, constipation, an enlarged tongue, umbilical hernia, <b>dry</b> <b>skin,</b> a decreased body temperature and jaundice. A goiter is rare, although it may develop later in children who have a thyroid gland that does not produce functioning thyroid hormone. A goiter may also develop in children growing up in areas with iodine deficiency. Normal growth and development may be delayed, and not treating infants may lead to an intellectual impairment (IQ 6–15 points lower in severe cases). Other problems include the following: large scale and fine motor skills and coordination, reduced muscle tone, squinting, decreased attention span, and delayed speaking. Tooth eruption may be delayed.|$|E
25|$|Dandruff {{can have}} several causes, {{including}} <b>dry</b> <b>skin,</b> seborrhoeic dermatitis, not cleaning/scrubbing often enough, shampooing too often, psoriasis, eczema, sensitivity to hair care products, or a yeast-like fungus. <b>Dry</b> <b>skin</b> {{is the most}} common cause of flaking dandruff.|$|E

40|$|Natural <b>dried</b> <b>skin</b> {{and leather}} {{which comes from}} fresh skin {{has been used for}} many {{applications}} in the automotive sector, furniture, clothes and other industries. However, the biomechanical properties of these materials have not been well established. Therefore, this study attempts to quantify and investigate the parameters o f fresh goat skin (Category I), natural <b>dried</b> <b>skin</b> (Category II) and leather (Category III), which also include orthotropic analysis (longitudinal and transverse directions). Uniaxial tensile test (ASTM D 2099 - 00) was conducted to obtain engineering stress-stretch data for all categories. Analytical and numerical approaches were also adapted to quantify the material parameters. Engineering stress-stretch curves for both approaches were fitted to the experiment data by adapting three hyperelastic materials models (i. e. neo- Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin and Ogden). Numerical approach adapting the Ogden model is likely the best hyperelastic material model in representing the parameters o f fresh goat <b>skin,</b> natural <b>dried</b> <b>skin</b> and leather. For each category, the Ogden parameters (a and |j.) range value were found from 15. 154 to 18. 344 and from 0. 152 MPa to 0. 277 MPa (Category I), from 0. 675 to 5. 652 and from 107. 416 MPa to 1185. 859 MPa (Category II) from 14. 815 to 15. 885 and from 1. 827 MPa to 4. 441 MPa (Category III) respectively. This study also found out that among fresh goat <b>skin,</b> natural <b>dried</b> <b>skin</b> and leather, natural <b>dried</b> <b>skin</b> was the stiffest skin of them all. As a conclusion, the biomechanical properties of fresh goat <b>skin,</b> natural <b>dried</b> <b>skin</b> and leather has been quantified, and thus proving that the objective o f the study has been achieved successfully...|$|R

25|$|Sjögren {{syndrome}} (SjS, SS) is {{a long-term}} autoimmune disease in which the moisture-producing glands of the body are affected.

25|$|Retinol at normal doses is well tolerated. High doses {{may result}} in an {{enlarged}} liver, <b>dry</b> <b>skin,</b> or hypervitaminosis A. High doses during pregnancy {{may result in}} harm to the baby. Retinol is in the vitamin A family. It {{or other forms of}} vitamin A are needed for eye sight, maintenance of the skin, and human development. It is converted in the body to retinal and retinoic acid through which it acts. Dietary sources include fish, dairy products, and meat.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{side effect of}} {{spironolactone}} is urinary frequency. Other general side effects include dehydration, hyponatremia (low sodium levels), mild hypotension (low blood pressure), ataxia (muscle incoordination), drowsiness, dizziness, <b>dry</b> <b>skin,</b> and rashes. Because it reduces androgen levels and directly blocks androgen signaling, spironolactone can, in men, cause breast tenderness, gynecomastia (breast development), and feminization in general, as well as testicular atrophy, reversibly reduced fertility, and sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. In women, spironolactone can cause menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and breast enlargement.|$|E
25|$|Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers {{can cause}} <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers {{are added to}} the formula. The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or {{eliminated}} by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula. In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents. Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs rarely occur. The lower tendency to induce irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction as compared to soap and water hand washing.|$|E

25|$|Excessive vitamin A {{consumption}} {{can lead}} to nausea, irritability, anorexia (reduced appetite), vomiting, blurry vision, headaches, hair loss, muscle and abdominal pain and weakness, drowsiness, and altered mental status. In chronic cases, hair loss, <b>dry</b> <b>skin,</b> drying of the mucous membranes, fever, insomnia, fatigue, weight loss, bone fractures, anemia, and diarrhea can all be evident {{on top of the}} symptoms associated with less serious toxicity. Some of these symptoms are also common to acne treatment with Isotretinoin. Chronically high doses of vitamin A, and also pharmaceutical retinoids such as 13-cis retinoic acid, can produce the syndrome of pseudotumor cerebri. This syndrome includes headache, blurring of vision and confusion, associated with increased intracerebral pressure. Symptoms begin to resolve when intake of the offending substance is stopped.|$|E
25|$|Xeroderma pigmentosum mostly {{affects the}} eye and skin. Individuals with XP have extreme {{sensitivity}} to light in the ultraviolet range starting from {{one to two years}} of age, and causes sunburn, freckling of skin, <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> and pigmentation after exposure. When the eye is exposed to sunlight, it becomes irritated and bloodshot, and the cornea becomes cloudy. Around 30% of affected individuals also develop neurological abnormalities, including deafness, poor coordination, decreased intellectual abilities, difficulty swallowing and talking, and seizures; these effects tend to become progressively worse over time. All affected individuals have a 1000-fold higher risk of developing skin cancer: half of the affected population develop skin cancer by age 10, usually at areas most exposed to sunlight (e.g. face, head, or neck). The risk for other cancers such as brain tumors, lung cancer and eye cancers also increase.|$|E
