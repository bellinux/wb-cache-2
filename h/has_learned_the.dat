Jim <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> company's financial situation from Pam, but feigns uncertainty when asked if Michael {{is likely to be}} interested in a buyout. At David and Charles's orders, Jim brings the idea of a buyout to Michael. While there he also reassures Michael that Dunder Mifflin is unaware of his company's financial situation. Dwight learns from a past client that Michael has been begging customers for more money and informs Charles, but Charles refuses to listen, having been embarrassed by Dwight's earlier ideas.|$|E
5|$|They {{are taken}} {{to the home of}} the queen, which lies near the ruins of the lost city of Kôr, a once mighty {{civilisation}} that predated the Egyptians. The queen and her retinue live under a dormant volcano in a series of catacombs built as tombs for the people of Kôr. There, Holly is presented to the queen, a white sorceress named Ayesha. Her beauty is so great that it enchants any man who beholds it. She, who is veiled and lies behind a partition, warns Holly that the power of her splendour arouses both desire and fear, but he is dubious. When she shows herself, however, Holly is enraptured and prostrates himself before her. Ayesha reveals that she <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> secret of immortality and that she possesses other supernatural powers including the ability to read the minds of others, a form of telegnosis and the ability to heal wounds and cure illness; she is also revealed to have a tremendous knowledge of chemistry, but is notably unable to see into the future. She tells Holly that she has lived in the realm of Kôr for more than two millennia, awaiting the reincarnated return of her lover, Kallikrates (whom she had slain in a fit of jealous rage). Later, when Holly inadvertently and secretly discovers Ayesha in her hidden chamber, he learns that she may have some degree of power to reanimate the dead.|$|E

25|$|In Heretics of Dune, Reverend Mother and Imprinter Lucilla {{is charged}} with the seduction-imprinting of the Duncan Idaho ghola so that the Sisterhood may assert some control over him; he {{ultimately}} avoids her. Lucilla also mentions the hundreds of sexual positions and variations she knows. In Heretics, the Honored Matres have themselves refined this ability to such an intense level that the targeted male becomes completely enslaved. The captured Honored Matre Murbella attempts this on Duncan; his own imprinting ability, secretly conditioned into him by his Tleilaxu creators, suddenly manifests itself. Murbella and Duncan basically imprint each other, neither having complete control over the other. In Chapterhouse Dune the order <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> Honored Matre method from Murbella and use it for their own purposes, specifically to awaken the memories within the Miles Teg ghola.|$|E

They fell out when Sheila discovered Naomi's affair with a married man and told his wife, which Naomi had never forgiven her for. Naomi's first scenes saw her meeting and flirting with Paul Robinson (Dennis), who was later {{surprised to learn that}} she was Sheila's daughter. She then reunited with her mother and her nephew Kyle (Chris Milligan). While Sheila was pleased to see her daughter, she was suspicious of her motives and sudden urge to see her. Mann commented, [...] "Sheila <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> hard way that there is always an agenda with Naomi. Nothing is ever as it seems." [...] When Sheila found a discarded SIM card, she hoped to find some clues as to why her daughter has reappeared in her life. After seeing a lot of number and messages stored on the card, Sheila believed Naomi was having another affair. She then accused Naomi of repeating her past mistakes and [...] "a fierce war of words" [...] erupted between the two, which resulted in Naomi deciding to leave. Sheila then promised not to interfere in her life and [...] "reluctantly" [...] offered Naomi a place to stay, until she got back on her feet.|$|E

2500|$|In SignWriting, a {{combination}} of iconic symbols for handshapes, orientation, body locations, facial expressions, contacts, and movement are used to represent words in sign language.

2500|$|The Book of Daniel is an apocalypse - a {{representative}} of a literary genre in which a heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient; such works are characterized by visions, symbolism, an other-worldly mediator, an emphasis on cosmic events, angels and demons, and pseudonymity (false authorship). The production of apocalypses occurred commonly from 300 BC to 100 AD, not only among Jews and Christians, but also among Greeks, Romans, Persians and Egyptians. Daniel, the book's hero, is {{a representative}} apocalyptic seer, {{the recipient of the}} divine revelation: he <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> wisdom of the Babylonian magicians and surpassed them, because his God is the true source of knowledge; {{he is one of the}} [...] maskil, the wise, who have the task of teaching righteousness.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "normative assessment" [...] {{refers to}} the process of {{comparing}} one test-taker to his or her peers. A norm-referenced test (NRT) is a type of test, assessment, or evaluation which yields an estimate of the position of the tested individual in a predefined population. The estimate is derived from the analysis of test scores and other relevant data from a sample drawn from the population. This type of test identifies whether the test taker performed better or worse than other students taking this test. A criterion-referenced test (CRT) is a style of test which uses test scores to show whether or not test takers performed well on a given task, not how well they performed compared to other test takers. Most tests and quizzes that are written by school teachers can be considered criterion-referenced tests. In this case, the objective is simply to see whether the student <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> material.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional {{masks are}} still handcrafted. Most {{traditional}} communities have {{one person who}} specializes in the craft. This person is almost always male who <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> trade from his father, with the occasional exception of a widow continuing her husband’s trade. Some mask makers specialize in those for a particular dance. Mask makers are respected as {{they need to know}} the significance of each dance to make the appropriate masks. Most mask makers have other occupations such as baker, wax worker, factory worker or carpenter. A number of mask makers are also makers of religious images called “santeros.” These craftsmen tend to make masks with fine features and finishes that imitate human skin. Production is aimed almost exclusively to dancers, although they are also made for collectors, and more fantastic ones for the tourist market, especially in Guerrero. It can be difficult to distinguish these masks from more “authentic” ones for dances. In a few communities, there is enough demand to have full-time mask makers, where hundreds are worn for major festivities. One of these is Tlaxcala because almost all dancers are masked. Many of these are made in the town of Apetatitlán de Antonio Carvajal by the Carlos Reyes Acoltzi family and the Mendez family of the city of Tlaxcala [...] Another area with a high demand for masks is Chiapa de Corzo, for the Parachicos dance performed for the feast of Saint Sebastian by thousands of dancers. The best known mask maker of this type is Antonio López, who also teaches the trade to young people. [...] There are still cases where dancers make their own mask, such as the Cora in Nayarit and the Mayo and Yaqui in Sinaloa and Sonora. These are not generally made of wood. In the Cora community, dancers are bound to make their own masks as part of the rituals for Holy Week from paper mache, painted white and bound with cloth. On Holy Wednesday, it is worn this way. On Maundy Thursday, black lines are added and then dyed on Good Friday.|$|E
