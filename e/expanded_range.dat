5|$|The {{adult cattle}} egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks {{may be lost}} to starvation, calcium {{deficiency}} or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming {{is believed to be}} a major cause of their suddenly <b>expanded</b> <b>range.</b> The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.|$|E
5|$|The modern Olympic Games {{were first}} held in Athens in 1896, and {{travelled}} to Paris {{four years later}} {{as part of the}} 1900 Exposition Universelle world's fair. The second Games featured a greatly <b>expanded</b> <b>range</b> of events from the first, up from 43 to 95. Among the events added in 1900 was the tug of war. Two tug of war teams were entered for the Paris tournament; Racing Club de France represented the host nation, along with a team from the United States which was composed of six athletes that were taking part in various other events during the Games. The American team withdrew from the competition, as they discovered that the tug of war was scheduled {{at the same time as}} the hammer throw which three of their team were competing in. A Scandinavian team was accepted as a late-entry by the organisers, comprising a mix of Swedish and Danish athletes competing at the Games. Various reports assign the credit for the formation and entry of this team to different sources; a Danish account claimed that it was one of the Danish pullers, Eugen Schmidt who was responsible, while a Swedish record attributed it to their representative at the Games, Lieutenant Bergh.|$|E

25|$|The codec's {{bit stream}} syntax was frozen {{at the first}} version, WMA 9 Pro. Later {{versions}} of WMA Pro introduced low-bit rate encoding, low-delay audio, frequency interpolation mode, and an <b>expanded</b> <b>range</b> of sampling rate and bit-depth encoding options. A WMA 10 Pro file compressed with frequency interpolation mode comprises a WMA 9 Pro track encoded at half the original sampling rate, which is then restored using a new compression algorithm. In this situation, WMA 9 Pro players which have not been updated to the WMA 10 Pro codec can only decode the lower quality WMA 9 Pro stream. Starting with WMA 10 Pro, eight channel encoding starts at 128kbit/s, and tracks can be encoded at the native audio CD resolution (44.1kHz, 16-bit), previously the domain of WMA Standard.|$|E

25|$|Emoji are {{pictograms}} {{that can}} be used and displayed inline with text. They are similar to previous symbol typefaces, but with a much larger range of characters, such as symbols for common objects, animals, food types, weather and emotions. Originally developed in Japan, they are now commonly installed on many computer and smartphone operating systems. Following standardisation and inclusion in the Unicode standard, allowing them to be used internationally, the number of Emoji characters has rapidly increased {{to meet the demands of}} an <b>expanded</b> <b>range</b> of cultures using them; unlike many previous symbol typefaces, they are interchangeable with the ability to display the pictures of the same meaning in a range of fonts on different operating systems. The popularity of emoji has meant that characters have sometimes gained culture-specific meanings not inherent to the design. Both colour and monochrome emoji typefaces exist, as well as at least one animated design.|$|E
25|$|Under Philip Flax a new Flax store {{opened in}} 1966, in the 27,000 square foot Goldberg Bowen Building at 250 Sutter Street. In 1978 a new {{location}} at 1699 Market Street opened, followed by {{the closure of the}} Sutter Street store in 1981. The company began distributing mail order catalogs nationally in 1984. Craig Flax oversaw the major growth and transition of the catalog business with an <b>expanded</b> <b>range</b> of gift-oriented items and eventually new specialty titles. Reflecting the broader product range, Flax's Artists Materials began doing business as FLAX art & design in 1991. Two new brands were developed, Collage and The Paper Catalog in 1995 and 1998 respectively, and featured photo albums, stationery, fine pens, and decorative papers marketed through catalogs and eCommerce websites. Through 2002 - 2003, Flax acquired the assets of Reliable Home Office, T. Shipley and Sparks.com. In 2005, the company achieved a ranking in Internet Retailers Top 500 Guide. Flax ceased all direct marketing activities by the end of 2007 and returned its focus to brick and mortar activity.|$|E
