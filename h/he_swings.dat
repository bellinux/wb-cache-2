5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, <b>he</b> <b>swings</b> them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E

25|$|Shabbir Ahmed {{is a tall}} (6'5"), Pakistani fast bowler. He {{extracts}} a {{great deal}} of bounce, even on lifeless wickets, and bowling from close to the stumps – much like Glenn McGrath – allows him to stick to a tight wicket-to-wicket line. He seams and cuts more than <b>he</b> <b>swings,</b> often sharply and both ways and is a sound exponent of reverse swing.|$|E
500|$|Pujols's swing {{has been}} praised for its consistency. [...] "It's the same swing every time", former {{teammate}} Lance Berkman once said. [...] "He {{has the ability}} to repeat his swing over and over and over, which leads to him being very consistent", Cardinals' video coordinator Chad Blair said. Sports Illustrated writer Daniel G. Habib described the swing as [...] "quick" [...] and [...] "quiet." [...] Pujols uses a 32.5-ounce bat against right-handed pitchers, but he uses a 33-ounce bat against left-handers to avoid trying to pull the ball when <b>he</b> <b>swings.</b> Defensively, Pujols has won two Gold Glove Awards since moving to first base in 2004. He has credited his hitting ability partly to guessing what pitchers will do: ...|$|E
500|$|Gogan has a {{flashing}} [...] "strength meter" [...] {{on the top}} of the screen that determines how much damage he can inflict on enemies when <b>he</b> <b>swings</b> his axe. The strength meter empties after attacking and then slowly refills back to its maximum. The strength meter increases by 25% whenever the player collects a [...] "crystal container". This incorporates an element of strategy in the game in which the player can either make a series of weak strikes with the axe or wait and build the strength meter for a single, more-powerful strike. Scattered throughout the game to help Gogan are miniature statues called [...] "Jagu idols" [...] that reveal power-ups when destroyed; these power-ups include [...] "crystal containers" [...] that increase Gogan's attack strength, wings that increase the speed of Gogan's attacks, power balls that help replenish Gogan's life meter, crystals that award bonus points, and extra lives. Additional lives can also be obtained by earning certain numbers of points.|$|E

There, he hit [...]306/.369/.500. One scout in Arizona noted that his swing was so effortless, yet generated so much line drive power, that: [...] "It's like <b>he's</b> <b>swinging</b> a Wiffleball bat out there." ...|$|R
500|$|Webb {{stated that}} he and the crew wanted to keep the stunts more {{grounded}} physically, a challenge for a superhuman character. The stunt performers included the Armstrong family, Vic and Andy, along with Richard Norton who plays a SWAT team member. Andy Armstrong was the stunt coordinator while Vic was the second unit director. To determine how Spider-Man should swing, Andy videotaped an Olympic Games gymnast swinging on a horizontal bar. Andy noted that in the computer-generated swing in the earlier Spider-Man films, [...] "he swings down at the same speed as <b>he</b> <b>swings</b> up," [...] and this [...] "constant" [...] speed is unlike a real gymnast's movement where [...] "he's accelerating until he reaches the bottom, then as he starts to come up, he's decelerating until he gets to the top of his swing and he actually gets negative gravity, where he'll go weightless for a second, and then the next swing starts, and it becomes another violent swing again." [...] Vic felt that Spider-Man's moves were comparable to those of Tarzan, and he wanted to add that in the film. While filming in New York City, they swung a man through traffic down the street. Then, while the crew built a rig hundreds of feet long over Riverside Drive in Harlem, Andy built a car rig with a series of wires to help with effects which Webb said required an [...] "incredible wealth of acrobatics". These rigs were over 200–300 feet long and demanded months of rehearsals and design. According to Andy, operating the rigs [...] "was a combination of a lot of human skills and mechanical engineering." [...] The purpose of the rigs was to depict Spider-Man's swing in a way that wasn't computer-generated. Garfield was reported to be involved with some of the stunts. Leaked pictures reveal Garfield with a nosebleed that reports claimed was from swinging. Arad explained that [...] "Andrew is not only a brilliant actor but he is a sportsman. This gave us the opportunity to try things with him that were it not so it would have been almost impossible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mr Isidore Godfrey {{approaches}} his evening's labours with an imperious gesture; <b>he</b> <b>swings</b> round, {{and with}} a comprehensive eye reduces even a Gilbert and Sullivan audience to silence for an overture – a very remarkable feat of hypnotism. [...] And then Mr Godfrey's baton attacks the score, as though about to plunge us into Götterdämmerung with his thin Falstaff's army of an orchestra.... Mr Godfrey by sheer force seems to draw some sonority out of his pitifully inadequate instrumental forces; Toscanini could do no more.|$|E
2500|$|According to The New York Times {{columnist}} Christopher Clarley, Youzhny's one-handed backhand {{is one of}} {{the more}} unusual ones on tour, hitting it with a [...] "free left arm accompanying his right arm as <b>he</b> <b>swings</b> through the ball." [...] Veteran coach Sven Groeneveld jokingly said that Youzhny's should be called a [...] "half one-hander". Youzhny hits the ball early on both sides, so as to [...] "achieve a flatter flight trajectory and to get the ball to the opponent's side quicker." [...] He is also noted for his good court sense and often uses drop shots to mix up his game, and he is very talented at volleying.|$|E
5000|$|In The Simpsons Movie, Homer Simpson is seen {{walking a}} pig {{on the ceiling}} singing [...] "Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig. Does {{whatever}} a Spider-Pig does. Can <b>he</b> <b>swing,</b> from a web? Pause No he can't, he's a pig. Look ooooooouuuut! He is a Spider-Pig!" [...] A choral version is in the closing credits, part of which appears in Homer's epiphany.|$|R

2500|$|An {{electric}} current is sent {{through the air}} at a set wave length and forms an airway along which the aircraft travels to its destination. The airway has three parallel zones—the T, N, and Azones. The T zone {{is the center of}} the road. It is about two miles wide at its maximum. While his ship stays in the center zone the pilot gets the (Morse) code letter T (— [...] "dash") through his receiving set. If he veers to the right, the T changes to an A(·— [...] "dot-dash"); if <b>he</b> <b>swings</b> to the left, the T gives way to N (—· [...] "dash-dot"). All the pilot has to do when he hears N or Ais to correct his course.|$|E
2500|$|In each [...] "Adventures" [...] segment {{in which}} Bill appears, he usually {{attempts}} {{to do something}} of an outdoors nature, such as backpacking, building something, chopping down a tree, or playing a sport. Each of his actions are basically slapstick comedy routines—for example, when <b>he</b> <b>swings</b> an axe, it flies {{out of his hands}} and smashes into another character or Red's Possum Van. [...] In what has become a classic occurrence, Bill often manages to knock {{one or both of the}} side mirrors off the van. He can also store large tools and miscellaneous items in his overalls, and pull them out on demand. Many segments show Bill getting hurt somehow, but apparently not seriously or permanently. (One segment in particular ends with Bill's arms crushed and flattened in a grape press.) There is generally no continuity from one [...] "Adventures" [...] segment to the next, and Bill comes back in the following episode good as new.|$|E
2500|$|Baseball America named Hirsh Houston's top {{prospect}} {{heading into}} the 2006 season; it also listed Hirsh as having the [...] "Best Control" [...] in the organization. Before the season, Houston added him to its 40-man roster. [...] "He's a very mature kid," [...] Astros assistant general manager Ricky Bennett said. [...] "He keeps everything in perspective." [...] With Hirsh in spring training with the major league team, manager Phil Garner summed up his estimation of Hirsh as follows: [...] "He {{looks to me like}} he maintains good concentration. [...] Whatever he's doing, he looks like he focuses at it. [...] He looks like he throws the ball down in the zone well, which is really good for as big as he is. And his stuff's good. [...] He looks like he has some of the other ingredients that you've got to have to go along with having good stuff. [...] He's a good athlete. [...] <b>He</b> <b>swings</b> the bat pretty good, and he moves on the mound well." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{differences}} between baseball and Test cricket is the primary intent of the batsman. Usually, in Test/First Class cricket, wickets come at a far higher premium, since survival is of primary importance. While nine innings per side are played in a baseball game within a few hours, only two per side are played in Test cricket over five days (thirty hours), so {{the cost of a}} dismissal is far higher in cricket. It should be kept in mind that a batsman in cricket is not obligated to take a run after striking the ball, nor is there any penalty for swinging at the ball and missing unless it hits the stumps (i.e. the wicket) (or, as often happens, makes a glancing contact with the bat and is caught) and there is no limit to the number of deliveries a batsman can face; a batsman with the required concentration, determination and technical ability often bats for several hours (occasionally days) without being dismissed. By contrast, in baseball a batter takes a serious penalty (a [...] "strike") if <b>he</b> <b>swings</b> and misses: three strikes result in an out, and if the batter hits he must run. This contrast means that in cricket, unlike baseball, the quality of a batsman's defensive game and footwork (unlike baseball batters, cricket batsmen are not required to keep their back foot grounded when hitting the ball) are of the utmost importance. The nuances of batting technique are also greater in cricket, since the interplays between bowling variations, field placements and scoring strengths are more dynamic. Since cricket is played over an extended duration, the bowler and the fielding captain have time to [...] "work over" [...] a batsman (e.g. trying several different bowlers). Thus, cricket batting requires a very tight technique and the ability to withstand sustained examinations.|$|E
