5|$|Around 1954, NATC {{modified}} the sole surviving XAJ-1 to conduct inflight refueling tests using the probe and <b>drogue</b> configuration. The turbojet engine was removed and the fuel hose and its <b>drogue</b> extended {{out from the}} jet's former exhaust opening. Aircraft in service retained the turbojet and had their bomb bay doors modified to accommodate the hose and <b>drogue.</b> They were refueling aircraft during late 1954.|$|E
5|$|Landing the {{aircraft}} required {{the extension of}} the retractable landing skid and the deployment of a braking <b>drogue</b> parachute. As pilots could access the plane only from a hatch above the cockpit, the pilot would have to enter the E.381 before it could be attached to the carrier Ar 234C and had no way to escape in case of an emergency, while attached to the carrier.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the Valiant fleet because of metal fatigue in December 1964 meant that the RAF had no front line tanker aircraft, so the B.1/1A aircraft, now judged to be surplus in the strategic bomber role, were refitted for this duty. To get some tankers into service as quickly as possible, six B.1A aircraft were converted to B(K).1A standard (later redesignated B.1A (K2P)), receiving a two-point system with a hose and <b>drogue</b> carried under each wing, while the bomb bay remained available for weapons. Handley Page worked day and night to convert these six aircraft, with the first being delivered on 28 April 1965, and 55 Squadron becoming operational in the tanker role in August 1965.|$|E

5|$|The orbital {{assembly}} of Mir began on February 19, 1986 with {{the launch of}} the Proton-K rocket. Four of the six modules which were later added (Kvant-2 in 1989, Kristall in 1990, Spektr in 1995 and Priroda in 1996) followed the same sequence {{to be added to the}} main Mir complex. Firstly, the module would be launched independently on its own Proton-K and chase the station automatically. It would then dock to the forward docking port on the core module's docking node, then extend its Lyappa arm to mate with a fixture on the node's exterior. The arm would then lift the module away from the forward docking port and rotate it on to the radial port where it was to mate, before lowering it to dock. The node was equipped with only two Konus drogues, which were required for dockings. This meant that, prior to the arrival of each new module, the node would have to be depressurised to allow spacewalking cosmonauts to manually relocate the <b>drogue</b> to the next port to be occupied.|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Satellites, such as ERTS- 1, {{can be used}} to obtain a synoptic view of current circulation over large coastal areas. Since in turbid coastal regions suspended sediment acts as a natural tracer, cost is minimized by eliminating the need for expensive injections of large volumes of dye such as Rhodamine-B. One of the principal shortcomings of satellite imaging of coastal currents was its inability to determine current magnitude and to penetrate beyond the upper few meters of the water column. These objections were overcome by complementing satellite observations with <b>drogues</b> tracking currents at various selected depths. By combining the satellite's wide coverage with aircraft or shore stations capable of tracking expendable <b>drogues,</b> a cost effective, integrated system was devised for monitoring currents over large areas, various depths, and under severe environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|A set of {{equations}} {{of motion}} is derived for vibratory motions of an underwater cable connected to a moving vehicle {{at one end and}} with <b>drogues</b> at the other end. From the static analysis, cable configurations are obtained for different vehicle speeds and towing pretensions are determined by fluid resistance of <b>drogues.</b> Also the dynamic analysis is required to predict its vibratory motion. Nonlinear fluid drag forces greatly influence the dynamic tension. In this study, a numerical analysis program was developed to find out the characteristic of cable behaviour. The motion is described in terms of space and time coordinates based on Chebyshev polynomial expansions. For the spatial integration the collocation method is employed and the Newmark method is applied for the time integration. Dynamic tensions, displacements, velocities, accelerations were predicted in the time domain while natural frequencies and transfer functions were obtained in the frequency domain...|$|R
40|$|Immediate use of <b>drogued</b> buoy {{tracking}} {{was made}} when the Virginia State Highway Department requested assistance in selecting the best route {{for a new}} bridge-tunnel complex across the James River at Newport News. The result was that the Highway Department acted and chose a preferred route from several alternatives. It was also observed that the <b>drogues</b> did not follow the channel as predicted by the James River hydraulic model. This permitted telling the Navy {{why it is that}} part of their channel always silts up. The Hampton Roads Sanitation District asked help locate the best route and position of an ocean sewer outfall.

25|$|As {{the seat}} moved further {{up and out}} of the {{aircraft}} a lanyard attached to the cockpit floor fired a steel rod, known as the <b>drogue</b> gun, this extracted two small parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path.

25|$|The B-50, {{with more}} {{powerful}} engines than the KB-29s in use by Tactical Air Command, {{was much more}} suitable to refuel tactical jet fighter aircraft, such as the F-100 Super Sabre. As tankers, KB-50s would feature extensively reinforced outer wing panels, the necessary equipment to air refuel simultaneously three fighter-type aircraft by the probe and <b>drogue</b> method, and removal of defensive armament.|$|E
25|$|The Tu-124 {{retained}} a <b>drogue</b> parachute {{to be used}} in an emergency landing or landing on a slippery surface and had low pressure tires to aid operation from unpaved airfields.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Acid waste plume {{was observed in}} LANDSAT imagery fourteen times ranging from during dump up to 54 hours after dump. Circulation processes at the waste disposal site are highly storm-dominated, {{with the majority of}} the water transport occurring during strong northeasterlies. There is a mean flow to the south along shore. This appears to be {{due to the fact that}} northeasterly winds produce stronger currents than those driven by southeasterly winds and by the thermohaline circulation. During the warm months (May through October), the ocean at the dump site stratifies with a distinct thermocline observed during all summer cruising at depths ranging from 10 to 21 m. During stratified conditions, the near-bottom currents were small. Surface currents responded to wind conditions resulting in rapid movement of surface <b>drogues</b> on windy days. Mid-depth <b>drogues</b> showed an intermediate behavior, moving more rapidly as wind velocities increased...|$|R

25|$|The Mk.10 seat is a {{development}} of the Mk.9. Like the Mk.9 it features only one firing handle (the face blind handle being deleted), use of the explosive gas system was extended to operate the <b>drogue</b> gun and harness release system.

For ease of maintenance the Mk.10 was designed with modular assemblies, avoiding the need to remove the whole seat from the aircraft for minor servicing tasks.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} {{was handled}} via the United States foreign military sales program, {{which in turn}} contracted McDonnell Douglas. Costs for the conversion were initially estimated at $89.5million (FY 1994). The aircraft was to be equipped with both a boom and a probe and <b>drogue</b> system. However, because McDonnell Douglas {{did not have any}} experience with the requested Remote Aerial Refueling Operator (RARO) system, and because the third aircraft differed from the original two, the program could not be completed at budget. By omitting the probe and <b>drogue</b> system and a fixed partition wall between the cargo and passenger, the cost could be limited at $96million. To make up for the cost increase McDonnell Douglas hired Dutch companies to do part of the work. The actual converting of the aircraft was done by KLM. Conversion of the aircraft was done from October 1994 to September 1995 for the first aircraft and from February to December 1995 for the second. This was much longer than planned, mostly because McDonnell Douglas delivered the parts late. This would have again increased the cost, but in the contract for the AH-64 Apaches which the Royal Netherlands Air Force also bought from McDonnell Douglas, the price was agreed to be kept at $96million.|$|E
