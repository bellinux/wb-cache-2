5|$|Diefenbaker {{would often}} spend {{weekends}} {{with his parents}} in Saskatoon. While there, he began to woo Olive Freeman, daughter of the Baptist minister, but in 1921, she moved with her family to Brandon, Manitoba, and the two lost touch for more than 20 years. He then courted Beth Newell, a cashier in Saskatoon, and by 1922, the two were engaged. However, in 1923, Newell was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and Diefenbaker broke off contact with her. She died the following year. Diefenbaker was himself subject to internal bleeding, and may have feared that the disease would be transmitted to him. In late 1923, he had an operation at the Mayo Clinic for a <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcer,</b> but his health remained uncertain for several more years.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, Cleveland's father {{moved to}} Clinton, Oneida County, New York, {{to work as}} {{district}} secretary for the American Home Missionary Society. Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, the income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school into a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling {{at the completion of}} the apprentice contract. In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and the family moved again. Shortly after, he died from a <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcer,</b> with Grover reputedly hearing of his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Mary's son by Darnley, James, {{was born}} on 19 June 1566 in Edinburgh Castle, but the murder of Rizzio led inevitably to the {{breakdown}} of her marriage. In October 1566, while staying at Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders, Mary made a journey on horseback of at least four hours each way to visit the Earl of Bothwell at Hermitage Castle, where he lay ill from wounds sustained in a skirmish with border reivers. The ride was later used as evidence by Mary's enemies that the two were lovers, though no suspicions were voiced {{at the time and}} Mary had been accompanied by her councillors and guards. Immediately after her return to Jedburgh, she suffered a serious illness that included frequent vomiting, loss of sight, loss of speech, convulsions and periods of unconsciousness. She was thought to be near death or dying. Her recovery from 25 October onwards was credited to the skill of her French physicians. The cause of her illness is unknown; diagnoses include physical exhaustion and mental stress, haemorrhage of a <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcer,</b> and porphyria.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cimetidine}} on the healing and recurrence of duodenal <b>ulcers</b> and <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> were compared. The {{extent of the}} acid secreting areas was examined by the endoscopic Congo red methylene blue test. Using the extent of acid secreting areas <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> were classified into ulcers with and without extensive acid secreting areas. Duodenal ulcers were all associated with extensive acid secreting areas. The gastric acid outputs in the basal state and after maximal stimulation with gastrin were highest in duodenal ulcers, and lowest in <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> without extensive acid secreting areas. Cimetidine treatment significantly promoted the healing of duodenal <b>ulcers</b> and <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> with extensive acid secreting areas when compared with placebo, but not of the <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> without extensive acid secreting areas. Cimetidine also significantly diminished the recurrence of duodenal <b>ulcers,</b> but not <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> with and without extensive acid secreting areas. These findings indicate that in Japan cimetidine promotes the healing of duodenal and <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> associated with high gastric acid production and prevents recurrence of duodenal ulcers, but {{has little or no}} influence on the healing and recurrence of <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> associated with low acid secretion...|$|R

40|$|Objective: <b>Gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> {{in green}} iguanas {{have not been}} {{described}} yet. In this first report this disease is presented. Material and methods: Clinical symptoms and diagnostic options of <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> in three green iguanas are described. Possible causes are discussed. Results: The unspecific clinical signs comprise apathy, anaemia, anorexia and to some extent, vomiting. Stress, e. g. due to hospitalisation {{and the application of}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may lead to <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> in green iguanas. Conclusions: Minimizing of stress (short hospitalisation, minimal handling, ideal housing conditions) and prophylactic use of antacids and histamine type 2 receptor antagonists are recommended. Generally, <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> in herbivorous reptiles should be taken into consideration as a secondary disease...|$|R
25|$|Seán Russell left {{to pursue}} the {{propaganda}} phase of the S-plan in the United States in March 1939, after the S-Plan military phase began in January 1939. On leaving he appointed Stephen Hayes as Acting Chief of Staff of the IRA. Russell never returned to Ireland, dying from an untreated <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcer</b> in 1940.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} the {{symptoms}} {{in relation to the}} meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers: A <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcer</b> would give epigastric pain during the meal, as gastric acid production is increased as food enters the stomach. Symptoms of duodenal ulcers would initially be relieved by a meal, as the pyloric sphincter closes to concentrate the stomach contents, therefore acid is not reaching the duodenum. Duodenal ulcer pain would manifest mostly 2–3hours after the meal, when the stomach begins to release digested food and acid into the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|Between 1907 and 1917, {{there were}} 60 {{deaths in the}} Archer Home. Relatives of her clients grew {{suspicious}} as they tallied {{the large number of}} deaths. Only 12 residents died between 1907 and 1910, but 48 residents died between 1911 and 1916. Among them was Franklin R. Andrews, an apparently healthy man. On the morning of May 29, 1914, Andrews was doing some gardening in the Archer house. His health collapsed within a day and he was dead by evening. The official cause of death was <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcer.</b>|$|E
40|$|Maximal acid output after {{pentagastrin}} stimulation, and fasting and postprandial serum gastrin {{concentrations was}} determined in 25 normal subjects, 30 patients with corpus <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers,</b> 10 patients with prepyloric ulcers and 30 patients with both duodenal and <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers.</b> Corpus ulcers and prepyloric ulcers formed one distinct group. Maximal acid output was abnormally {{low in the}} corpus ulcer patients and no different from normal in prepyloric ulcer patients, whereas fasting serum gastrin and postprandial integrated gastrin response was abnormally high in the former and {{no different from the}} normal in the latter. Furthermore, as in the normal subjects, a significant negative correlation between maximal acid output expressed in mmol h - 1 kg - 1 body weight and postprandial integrated gastrin response was observed in the corpus and prepyloric ulcer patients taken as a group. In complete contrast patients with both duodenal and <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers,</b> in whom postprandial integrated gastrin response was statistically highest amongst the three types of <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers,</b> had a significantly positive correlation between maximal acid output and the integrated gastrin response. These findings suggest the operation of different pathophysiological mechanisms in <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> with and without associated duodenal ulcers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|Poirot {{is asked}} for help by a physician, Dr Charles Oldfield, who has a {{practice}} in Market Loughborough, a small village in Berkshire. His wife died {{just over a year}} ago and the malicious talk in the village is that he poisoned her. People are avoiding him and several poison pen letters have been sent to him but he can do nothing to stem this tide of ill-intentioned gossip – like the heads of the Lernaean Hydra, when one source of the gossip is cut off, another grows in its place. So, his ultimate aim was to cut the main source of the gossip, just like the hydra had been slain by cutting its vulnerable head. Mrs Oldfield was a difficult invalid whose death was put down to a <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcer,</b> whose symptoms are similar to that of arsenic poisoning. She left her husband a not-inconsiderable sum of money and, under pressure, Oldfield admits {{that a lot of the}} talk revolves around Jean Moncrieffe, his young dispenser, who he wants to marry but dare not because of the talk. Poirot travels to Market Loughborough and meets Jean. She is frank about her relationship with Oldfield and her dislike of his wife but opposes Poirot's idea of an exhumation and autopsy on the body. Poirot makes the rounds of the village, insinuating that he is connected with the Home Office and thereby generating much hypocritical murmurs of sympathy for the doctor and, more importantly, names of who said what and when. From this he learns of the present whereabouts of two servants of the Oldfields who left their employ after Mrs Oldfield died; Nurse Harrison, who tended to the patient, and Beatrice, the family maid. Nurse Harrison tells a story of overhearing Jean and the Doctor talking about the imminent death of his wife in which it was clear that this was an event that both of them were impatiently waiting for. The nurse is certain that Beatrice must have overheard the talk as well. Poirot tells her of the supposed plans of exhumation and the nurse considers this news and then tells him she agrees that such a thing should be done. While being interviewed, Beatrice slyly denies overhearing any conversation but tells him of several suspicious stories of Jean making medicines or pots of tea for Mrs Oldfield which the nurse poured away or changed before the patient could take them.|$|E
500|$|During the {{struggle}} at Boggart Hole Clough, Richard Pankhurst began to experience severe stomach pains. He {{had developed a}} <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcer,</b> and his health deteriorated in 1897. The family moved briefly to Mobberley, {{with the hope that}} country air would help his condition. He soon felt well again, and the family returned to Manchester in the autumn. In the summer of 1898 he suffered a sudden relapse. Pankhurst had taken their oldest daughter Christabel to Corsier, Switzerland, to visit her old friend Noémie. A telegram arrived from Richard, reading: [...] "I am not well. Please come home, my love." [...] Leaving Christabel with Noémie, Pankhurst returned immediately to England. On 5 July, while on a train from London to Manchester, she noticed a newspaper announcing the death of Richard Pankhurst.|$|E

500|$|Formby {{returned}} to Britain at Christmas and appeared in Dick Whittington at the Grand Theatre, Leeds for nine weeks, and then, in February 1947, {{he appeared in}} variety for two weeks at the London Palladium. Reviewing the show, The Times thought Formby was [...] "more than ever the mechanized perfection of naive jollity. His smile, though fixed, is winning, and his songs... are catchy". In September that year he went on a 12-week tour of Australia and New Zealand. On his return he was offered more film roles, but turned them down, saying [...] "when I look back {{on some of the}} films I've done in the past {{it makes me want to}} cringe.

500|$|After several {{additional}} unauthorized leaks, Montag enlisted songwriter Cathy Dennis {{to continue}} {{work on her}} album. She released her first two extended plays Wherever I Am and Here She Is... in 2009. The former included the song [...] "More Is More"; debuting at number 50 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart, it became her first and only song to chart in the country.

2500|$|Horses form ulcers in {{the stomach}} fairly commonly, a disease called equine <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcer</b> syndrome. [...] Risk factors include confinement, {{infrequent}} feedings, {{a high proportion of}} concentrate feeds, such as grains, excessive non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and the stress of shipping and showing. [...] Gastric ulceration has also been associated with the consumption of cantharidin beetles in alfalfa hay which are very caustic when chewed and ingested. [...] Most ulcers are treatable with medications that inhibit the acid producing cells of the stomach. Antacids are less effective in horses than in humans, because horses produce stomach acid almost constantly, while humans produce acid mainly when eating. Dietary management is critical. [...] Bleeding ulcers leading to stomach rupture are rare.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the gastroprotective {{activity}} of plants have highlighted {{the importance of the}} polyphenolic compound epicatechin (EC) in the treatment of <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers.</b> This paper aimed to evaluate and characterize the gastroprotective mechanism of action of EC using male rats. The gastroprotective action of EC was analyzed in <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> induced by ethanol or indomethacin. The involvement of sulfhydryl (SH) groups, K+ATP channels, α 2 adrenoceptors, gastric antisecretory activity, and the amount of mucus in the development of <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> were investigated. The lowest effective dose of EC providing gastroprotective effects was 50 [*]mg/kg in the ethanol-induced <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers</b> and 25 [*]mg/kg in the indomethacin-induced <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcers.</b> The gastroprotection seen upon treatment with EC was significantly decreased in rats pretreated with a SH compound reagent or an α 2 -receptor antagonist, but not with a K+ATP channel blocker. Furthermore, oral treatment with EC increased mucus production and decreased H+ secretion. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the involvement of superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide (NO), and heat shock protein- 70 (HSP- 70) in the gastroprotection.

"Precisely," [...] she said; [...] "and {{the emotion}} would only further confirm and give new {{force to the}} tendencies which her aunt's death left her free to indulge {{as much as she}} liked. Remorse, contrition--they would lead to the idea of doing penance. And for one who was now wallowing in the martyrology, penance was the mortification of the flesh. She used to kneel for hours, at night, in the cold; she ate too little, and when her teeth ached, which they often did,--for she had a set, the doctor told me, which had given trouble from the very first,--she would not go and see the dentist, but lay awake at night, savouring to the full her excruciations, and feeling triumphantly that they must, in some strange way, be {{pleasing}} to the Mysterious Powers. She went on like that for two or three years, till she was poisoned through and through. In the end she went down with <b>gastric</b> <b>ulcer.</b> It was three months before she came out of hospital, well {{for the first time in}} a long space of years, and with a brand new set of imperishable teeth, all gold and ivory. And in mind, too, she was changed--for the better, I suppose. The nuns who nursed her had made her see that in mortifying herself she had acted supererogatively and through spiritual pride; instead of doing right, she had sinned. The only road to salvation, they told her, lay in discipline, in the orderliness of established religion, in obedience to authority. Secretly, so as not to distress her poor father, whose Agnosticismus was extremely dogmatic, for all its unobtrusiveness, Melpomene became a Roman Catholic. She was twenty-two.
