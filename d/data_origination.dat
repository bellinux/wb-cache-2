40|$|As a {{consequence}} of recent revisions to the regulations that implement the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), new information is now publicly available on the geographic distribution of small loans to businesses and farms and on community development lending. Because small businesses and small farms {{are more likely than}} larger ones to borrow small amounts, the CRA data on small loans are likely to provide a reasonable measure of the extension of credit to such businesses. Thus, the CRA data provide new opportunities to gauge the flow of credit to communities with differing economic and demographic characteristics.

40|$|A {{malicious}} insider in {{a sensor}} network may sabotage the network {{at any level}} of operation. While most prior work on network-layer security has focused on providing control plane integrity (specifically, routing correctness), we approach a complementary and equally important problem: data plane reliability. In a data plane attack, the attacker does not attack the routing control logic, but instead directly manipulates the data payloads flowing on the network to cause disruption. We reduce the general problem of data-plane manipulation attacks to two specific attacks: packet dropping and injection, and propose two complementary protocols {{to address the problem}} as a whole. We address packet dropping with a probabilistic probing protocol which can bound the end-to-end drop rate below a fixed threshold for a given path in the presence of multiple adversarial nodes and natural packet loss. We address packet injection with a rate-limiting mechanism based on per-epoch audit to detect nodes which exceed their allotted <b>data</b> <b>origination</b> rates. In both protocols, an adversary can misbehave by at most a fixed amount on expectation, before it is detected; after detection, one of the links under its control will be removed. Hence, the total amount of misbehavior (packet injection or dropping) an adversary can inflict is a constant regardless of the lifetime of the network. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAero engines clearly {{differ from}} other {{propulsion}} systems used in general mechanical engineering particularly through {{the materials used}} and the extreme stresses that occur during operation. Boltholes in rotating turbine and compressor disks {{are among the most}} highly-stressed geometric features of jet-engines. For manufacturers of jet-engine components it is important to assess the quality of these at an early stage in the manufacturing of the product. The use of commercially available monitoring systems in hole-making has been successful in individual cases so far. Major reasons for this lack of effectiveness are the large material variations within one production batch, the overall difficult machinability of the materials applied, the small lot size which makes “teach-in” operations ineffective. Additional challenges occur during the implementation of monitoring systems in production. Here, the monitoring solution is judged predominantly by its robustness, its reliability against false alarms and its level of integration in the machine tool. A high level of integration can be achieved by using internal data, provided by the components of the machine tools themselves. The paper describes a new approach in real-time monitoring for drilling boltholes. In an experimental setup, process <b>data</b> <b>origination</b> from the NC of a Sinumeric 840 D, collected by an OPC-Server had been processed. Comparing OPC data logging, DAU data logging and profibus data logging with respect to data quality, sample rate and real-time behaviour, profibus data logging appears to be the favourable choice. Compared to the price of many dedicated external sensors, all three methods to log internal data provide data access with small investments on a high level of integration. The experimental results indicate that OPC-data are suitable for tool wear monitoring and surface quality evaluation after drilling with solid carbide drills and face cutting reamers in Inconel 718 workpieces...|$|E
40|$|For {{researches}} in {{the field}} of the data mining and machine learning the necessary condition is an availability of various input data set. Now researchers create the databases of such sets. Examples of the following systems are: The UCI Machine Learning Repository, Data Envelopment Analysis Dataset Repository, XMLData Repository, Frequent Itemset Mining Dataset Repository. Along with above specified statistical repositories, the whole pleiad from simple filestores to specialized repositories can be used by researchers during solution of applied tasks, researches of own algorithms and scientific problems. It would seem, a single complexity for the user will be search and direct understanding of structure of so separated storages of the information. However detailed research of such repositories leads us to comprehension of deeper problems existing in usage of data. In particular a complete mismatch and rigidity of data files structure with SDMX - Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange - standard and structure used by many European organizations, impossibility of preliminary <b>data</b> <b>origination</b> to the concrete applied task, lack of data usage history for those or other scientific and applied tasks. Now there are lots of methods of data miming, as well as quantities of data stored in various repositories. In repositories there are no methods of DM (data miming) and moreover, methods are not linked to application areas. An essential problem is subject domain link (problem domain), methods of DM and datasets for an appropriate method. Therefore in this work we consider the building problem of ontological models of DM methods, interaction description of methods of data corresponding to them from repositories and intelligent agents allowing the statistical repository user to choose the appropriate method and data corresponding to the solved task. In this work the system structure is offered, the intelligent search agent on ontological model of DM methods considering the personal inquiries of the user is realized.

40|$|Since February 2010, {{detailed}} information on every home mortgage default and foreclosure in New York State must be filed with the New York State Banking Department (NYSBD). Pairing the NYSBD's data with <b>data</b> on <b>originations</b> from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) enables us to identify the race and ethnicity of borrowers who defaulted on their home mortgages (in New York State). Like many previous studies, we find strong racial and ethnic disparities in lending practices, {{but we do not}} find conclusive evidence that HMDA-measurable forms of discrimination increased a borrower's probability of default. After controlling for other factors, we find that the interest rates charged to black and Latino borrowers tended to be higher than the ones charged to their white and non-Latino counterparts. This may be one reason why blacks and Latinos tend to default at a higher rate, but other factors, such as the tendency of black and Latino borrowers to take out larger loans than their white and non-Latino counterparts, may also have contributed to the higher default rate among black and Latino borrowers. ...|$|R

40|$|A recent, widely cited {{study of}} North Carolina's anti-predatory lending law {{conducted}} by three analysts at the University of North Carolina purports {{to show that}} the law has been effective in curbing undesirable lending abuses while having essentially no negative side-effects on the volume of legitimate subprime lending to borrowers unable to qualify for prime credit. These findings are {{in stark contrast to the}} findings of earlier studies. This essay suggests one reason for the discrepancy: The UNC study relies on a database that does not contain the information properly required to address these issues, namely <b>data</b> on mortgage <b>originations.</b> The database instead contains information on the volumes of loans that have been securitized, which for reasons argued here, are not likely to represent accurately the trends in mortgage originations. For this and other reasons discussed below, until a thorough analysis of mortgage originations demonstrates otherwise, policy makers throughout the country should remain concerned about the unwanted side-effects of laudably intended state legislation aimed at stamping out predatory lending. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{identify}} the primary and crucial stressors that Palestinian employees encounter, and in turn design appropriate stress management and prevention strategies that will promote healthy organizations. Design/methodology/approach – A survey questionnaire was utilized for collecting <b>data</b> from 400 <b>originations</b> (response rate 77 percent). SPSS (version 12) was used mainly for paired samples t-test after transforming and recoding the personality type scale to the same format of the work environment conditions. The Cronbach’s alpha test was used for questions 13, 14 to ensure the reliability. Findings – The differences in employees’ personality types, and their stress coping styles, are the primary stressors. Palestinian personality type A, a major factor, largely influenced by living conditions. Employees in the private sector experience more stress than those in public or NGO sectors. Prevention strategies are needed to improve coping skills against the demanding conditions. Practical implications – Prevention strategies are needed to focus on the employees and improve their coping skills against the demanding conditions through initiatives such as employee assistance programs (EAPs). At a national level, collaboration among industry, labor, universities and ministries is needed to form an occupational health and safety institute to conduct research and monitor the stress in private and public organizations. Originality/value – This is one of the first empirical studies of organizational stress and prevention strategies in Palestinian organizations.

40|$|We {{show that}} the lightly {{regulated}} non-bank mortgage originators contributed disproportionately to the recent boom-bust housing cycle. Using comprehensive <b>data</b> on mortgage <b>originations,</b> which we aggregate at the county level, we first establish that the market share of these independent non-bank lenders increased in virtually all US counties during the boom. We then exploit the heterogeneity in the market share of independent lenders across counties as of 2005 and show that higher market participation by these lenders is associated with increased foreclosure filing rates {{at the onset of}} the housing downturn. We carefully control for counties'' economic, demographic, and housing market characteristics using both parametric and semi-nonparametric methods. We show that this relation between the pre-crisis market share of independents and the rise in foreclosure is more pronounced in less regulated states. The macroeconomic consequences of our findings are significant: we {{show that the}} market share of these lenders as of 2005 is also a strong predictor of the severity of the housing downturn and subsequent rise in unemployment. Overall our findings lend support to the view that more stringent regulation could have averted some of the volatility on the housing market during the recent boom-bust episode.

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed for collecting fine-grained employee commute <b>origination</b> <b>data</b> from employers in major employment centers. Many U. S. multinational firms have adopted the European Parliament Privacy Directive 95 / 46 /EC, the strictest privacy law to date. The methodology discussed complies with this Directive. “Fine-grained ” is defined as providing sufficient resolution (approximately 1, 000 feet) to assist transportation planning of individual bus stops. Directive 95 / 46 /EC provides for “anonymization ” of data to where the data subject is no longer identifiable. Individual address data is aggregated to a 1 / 5 by 1 / 5 mile grid at the employer site using commercial geographic information systems software. Once the grid data is taken from employer premises, data is combined {{with those of other}} employers, providing further anonymization. 8, 200 out of approximately 20, 000 worker addresses have been collected from the Stanford Research Park employment center in Palo Alto, California using this methodology. While the sprawling spatial distribution of these addresses challenges many Transportation Demand Reduction strategies, planned transit system improvements should result in a significant patronage increase. This methodology could be automated and applied nationally by the U. S. Census Bureau as part of their Transportation Planning Package, creating higher quality transportation data for improved investment decision making, ridesharing, and transit routing.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of the current trend in urban condominium and loft sales in the United States. It focuses specifically on the question of whom, demographically speaking, is buying the incredible influx of new urban residential products that has come onto the market since 2000. There is only anecdotal evidence gathered to date, where some claim that it is the empty-nesters abandoning the suburbs for the convenience of city life. However, there has not been the corresponding drop in suburban population levels or house sale levels to corroborate that hypothesis. Other market participants claim that the sales are primarily to investors, who are either renting or riding appreciation expectations to resell. If that is true, then there are considerable market implications for the future. Others project that it is an urban pied-a-terre trend; however the 2000 census only identifies 3 % of the whole housing stock as seasonal, recreational, or second homes. This thesis pools and analyzes recent historical data in four urban downtowns: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and San Diego to determine what is happening in each city and to try to discover a national trend. It utilizes raw mortgage <b>origination</b> <b>data,</b> assessor's data, and surveys and interviews with developers and brokers {{in each of the four}} designated cities. (cont.) In addition to demographic profiles of buyers, this study determines whether these are second homes, speculative purchases, or complete relocations from outside the city. Ultimately, what can be concluded from this analysis is that a much larger segment of demand for urban condos in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago and San Diego consists of second home purchasers and investors than are counted in the 2000 Census. Surveys of 7849 units indicate 66 % owner occupancy, 22 % second home purchase plus investors with no plan to rent and finally another 12 % investors who rent out their units. Trends are similar across markets, although the Atlanta market is driven by younger buyers and San Diego has the lowest percentage of owner occupants, indicating the most speculative buying. by Robert M.

The technology promotes the fact that CD-ROM applications are fun and entertaining ways to learn as well as allowing interaction with the user. Some CD-ROM products already on the market include children 2 ̆ 7 s books, reference books, and adventure games. CD-ROMs also offer users of the desktop many advantages including high storage capacity, permanency, and easy accessibility to data. However, the biggest disadvantage to CD-ROM is its slow seek time and data transfer rate. This thesis project is comprised of two parts. The first part involves the creation of a CD-ROM application. In this case, it is a poster book. The poster book was designed to give the impression of 2 ̆ 2 motion 2 ̆ 2 within the pages. Some of the hardware and software utilized in the implementation of the poster book include QuarkXPress, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and the Macintosh Quadra 700. Using Kodak 2 ̆ 7 s Writable CD-ROM hardware and software, the poster book 2 ̆ 7 s digital file was then written to a CD-ROM disc. The second part of this thesis project involves the development of a reference guide. The reference guide explains the basic steps on how to create a CD-ROM application. It is designed to serve desktop users and novices to CD-ROM technology. Most resources that were available were too complex for any beginner to comprehend in completing their CD-ROM projects.
