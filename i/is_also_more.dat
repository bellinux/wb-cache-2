5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid {{water as a}} solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane. Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than methane. Water <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E
5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the Sun and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 36% {{greater than that of}} the Sun and it is 90% more luminous. The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of the Sun and is therefore described as metal-rich. Mu Arae <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> enriched than the Sun in the element helium.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{disorders}} occur {{more often}} in people with epilepsy, depending partly on the epilepsy syndrome present. These include depression, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and migraine. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affects {{three to five times}} more children with epilepsy than children without the condition. ADHD and epilepsy have significant consequences on a child's behavioral, learning, and social development. Epilepsy <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> common in children with autism.|$|E

50|$|Research {{indicates}} that facial symmetry {{is linked to}} the 'big-five' model of personality. The most consistent finding is that facial symmetry is positively correlated with extraversion, indicating that individuals with <b>more</b> symmetric faces <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> extroverted. <b>More</b> symmetrical faces <b>are</b> <b>also</b> judged to <b>be</b> lower on neuroticism but higher on conscientiousness and agreeableness. <b>More</b> symmetrical faces <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> likely to have more desirable social attributes assigned to them, such as sociable, intelligent or lively.|$|R
5|$|Some sites along Shackleton's rim receive almost {{constant}} illumination. At these locales sunlight {{is almost}} always available for conversion into electricity using solar panels, potentially making them good locations for future Moon landings. The temperature at this site <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of 100°C when the Sun is overhead, to as low as −150°C during the lunar night.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (first found in people with the disease systemic lupus erythematosus but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E
5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing. The {{greatest}} of these is global warming and the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the first}} corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E

5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E
5|$|Levels in {{the game}} include a mixture of platforming, {{swimming}} and on-rails levels. They are based around several returning themes including forests, cliff-sides, factories and mountain tops. The level design is more diverse compared to its predecessors, which includes more complex puzzles and obstacles. Every level has an enemy called a Koin; each of these enemies bears the DK Coin of their respective level, holding it as a shield. As these enemies always face towards the player, they must be defeated by throwing a steel barrel over them so it bounces off a wall behind {{them in order to}} strike them from behind. The game overworld <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> complex, allowing players to explore between each area instead of forcing them along a linear path. To achieve this, the game includes several vehicles such as a speedboat and hovercraft which can be used to traverse the overworld and access different worlds.|$|E
5|$|MS is not {{considered}} a hereditary disease; however, a number of genetic variations {{have been shown to}} increase the risk. Some of these genes appear to have higher levels of expression in microglial cells than expected by chance. The probability of developing the disease is higher in relatives of an affected person, with a greater risk among those more closely related. In identical twins both are affected about 30% of the time, while around 5% for non-identical twins and 2.5% of siblings are affected with a lower percentage of half-siblings. If both parents are affected the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population. MS <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> common in some ethnic groups than others.|$|E

5|$|People with AIDS have an {{increased}} risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV. The second most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%. Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8. Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> common in those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|The Sunwin Stand {{has further}} room for expansion, and is unusual because it only runs {{three-quarters of the}} length of the pitch. The rest of this side is taken up by a brick building, {{situated}} in the south west corner of the stadium, which houses the club changing rooms and the security offices. The Sunwin Stand also includes the ground's 17executive boxes and conference facilities, which have capacity for up to 700people. A second function room, called the Bantams Bar, in the Kop, has room for another 300 people. There <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> office space, a club store, ticket office and museum in the car park behind the Kop. From early 2010, the area near the store will also include a dental surgery, which will be run by NHS Bradford and Airedale in partnership with the football club.|$|E
5|$|Triton is the seventh-largest {{moon and}} sixteenth-largest {{object in the}} Solar System, and is {{modestly}} larger than the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris. It comprises more than 99.5% of all the mass known to orbit Neptune, including the planet's rings and thirteen other known moons, and <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> massive than all known moons in the Solar System smaller than itself combined. Also, with a diameter 5.5% that of Neptune, {{it is the largest}} moon of a gas giant relative to its planet in terms of diameter, although Titan is bigger relative to Saturn in terms of mass. It has a radius, density (2.061 g/cm3), temperature and chemical composition similar to those of Pluto.|$|E

5|$|While some mosaics {{have been}} {{unearthed}} from religious sanctuaries and public buildings, {{most of them}} were found in residential buildings and private homes. The majority of these houses possess an irregular-shaped floor plan, while the second largest group were built with a peristyle central courtyard. Simple mosaics were usually relegated to normal walkways, whereas rooms designated for receiving guests featured more richly-decorated mosaics. However, only twenty-five houses of Delos feature opus tessellatum mosaics and only eight houses possess the opus vermiculatum-style motifs and figured scenes. The vast majority of decorated floors feature only simple geometric patterns. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> common for opus vermiculatum and opus tessellatum mosaics to be found in upstairs rooms than on the ground floors of ancient Delian homes. With the exception of the House of Dionysos and House of the Dolphins, the courtyards of peristyle homes in Delos feature only floral and geometric motifs.|$|E
5|$|Based on a {{courtyard}} house layout, externally the harled whinstone rubble mansion {{is a combination}} of Elizabethan and Jacobean (or Gothic) design, similar to Smith's work at Slains. A spacious central courtyard is surrounded by buildings three storeys high. Within the back of the courtyard, circular towers enclose the service stairways. A large Elizabethan-style tower housing the main stairway is also set within the courtyard but sited to the front behind the reception rooms. Other external features include: canted and box bays; a variety of lofty towers that are round, square or octagonal; many different gables; and numerous diagonally set stone flues. The southeast facing front elevation lacks symmetry with the main Tudor style entranceway set off centre and extending out. A plaque commemorating the building dates of 1839–1842 and a central armorial are above the round arched entrance. There is also an eight-sided tower positioned at the front corner. A separate driveway accesses the outside kitchen yard {{at the back of the}} north west elevation. This side of the mansion is plainer, more restrained and built into the slope of the hillside. A lengthy one storey lean-to houses fuel supplies and servants toilets and provides additional ground support. The northeast elevation <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>more</b> architecturally reserved than the front.|$|E
