5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E
25|$|However, Charlotte did {{not allow}} herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, {{coincidence}} came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone {{in the dining room}} she noticed a small notebook lying open on in the drawer of Emily's portable writing desk and of my sister Emily's handwriting. She read it and was <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt, more than surprise , a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music – wild, melancholy, and elevating. In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.|$|E
500|$|In India, {{the film}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5 out of 5 stars, reporting [...] "On the whole, Dhoom 2 {{is a winner}} all the way. For Yash Raj, who've not only produced but also distributed the film, Dhoom 2 should emerge {{as one of the}} biggest hits of their career." [...] Rajesh Karkera of Rediff gave it three and a half stars out of five, calling it [...] "A complete roller-coaster ride which left me completely enthralled and exhausted. Sure, there are faults when you stop to think rationally. But that does not stop you from being <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> film." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it a three star rating, saying that Dhoom 2 is without doubt better than its predecessor, and that Hrithik Roshan is {{the heart and soul of}} the film. Vijay Venkataramanan of Planet Bollywood gave it seven out of ten stars; while complaining about flaws in the plot and Aishwarya Rai’s performance, he still called it a good adrenaline-pumping entertainer.|$|E

500|$|Some of {{the most}} {{unfavorable}} reviews came from major American newspapers. A.O. Scott of The New York Times describes 300 as [...] "about as violent as Apocalypto and twice as stupid," [...] while criticizing its color scheme and suggesting that its plot includes racist undertones; Scott also poked fun at the buffed bodies of the actors portraying the Spartans, declaring that the Persian characters are [...] "pioneers {{in the art of}} face-piercing", but that the Spartans had access to [...] "superior health clubs and electrolysis facilities". Kenneth Turan writes in the Los Angeles Times that [...] "unless you love violence as much as a Spartan, Quentin Tarantino or a video-game-playing teenage boy, you will not be endlessly fascinated." [...] Roger Ebert, in his review, gave the film a two-star rating, writing, [...] "300 has one-dimensional caricatures who talk like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud." [...] Some critics employed at Greek newspapers have been particularly critical, such as film critic Robby Eksiel, who said that moviegoers would be <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> [...] "digital action" [...] but irritated by the [...] "pompous interpretations and one-dimensional characters." ...|$|E
500|$|The pair {{discussed}} {{having an}} Act 1 musical scene involving Anna and the King's wives. [...] The lyrics for that scene {{proved to be}} very difficult for Hammerstein to write. [...] He first thought that Anna would simply tell the wives something about her past, and wrote such lyrics as [...] "I was <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> splendor/Of Calcutta and Bombay" [...] and [...] "The celebrities were many/And the parties very gay/(I recall a curry dinner/And a certain Major Grey)." [...] Eventually, Hammerstein decided to write about how Anna felt, a song which would not only explain her past and her motivation for traveling with her son to the court of Siam, but also serve to establish a bond with Tuptim and lay the groundwork for the conflict that devastates Anna's relationship with the King. [...] "Hello, Young Lovers", the resulting song, was the work of five exhausting weeks for Hammerstein. [...] He finally sent the lyrics to Rodgers by messenger and awaited his reaction. [...] Hammerstein considered the song his best work and was anxious to hear what Rodgers thought of it, but no comment came from Rodgers. [...] Pride kept Hammerstein from asking. [...] Finally, after four days, the two happened to be talking on the phone about other matters, {{and at the end of}} the conversation, Rodgers stated, very briefly, that the lyric was fine. [...] Josh Logan, who had worked closely with Hammerstein on South Pacific, listened to the usually unflappable writer pour out his unhappy feelings. [...] It was one of the few times that Hammerstein and Rodgers did not display a united front.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{disaster}} in Russia, Napoleon ordered four bodies of cavalry {{to be rebuilt}} for his army in Germany. These were the Imperial Guard cavalry, the I Cavalry Corps led by General of Division Victor de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg, the II Cavalry Corps under General of Division Horace François Bastien Sébastiani, and the III Cavalry Corps under General of Division Jean-Toussaint Arrighi de Casanova. The I and II Corps were to have three heavy and four light cavalry divisions. On April 15, the II Cavalry Corps numbered 149 officers, 3,144 troopers, and 3,581 horses. At the end of April the I Cavalry Corps had 172 officers, 3,343 men, and 3,705 horses deployed along the Elbe River. The lack of trained horses and cavalrymen was {{one reason for the}} French defeat in 1813. On 15 May, the size of the I Cavalry Corps in Napoleon's main army had been raised to 9,800 troopers in 45 to 50 squadrons. On that date, the II Cavalry Corps in Marshal Michel Ney's army numbered 3,000 horsemen in 15 squadrons. [...] At the battles of Lützen and Bautzen Napoleon only employed the I Cavalry Corps. The II Cavalry Corps and the II Corps missed Bautzen because Napoleon was <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> possibility of capturing Berlin. Belatedly, the emperor realized that the Allies were offering battle at Bautzen and giving him an opportunity to smash them. But his orders to Ney were too late for the two corps to arrive in time.|$|E

40|$|The {{increase}} in availability {{and application of}} various laser sources poses an increasing threat to the human eye. Not only the actual damage dealt to the retina or {{other parts of the}} eye, but also dazzling during critical tasks has to be faced. However, experiments to verify the actual threat due to dazzling are quite critical, as it is almost never possible or even reasonable, to dazzle human observers. Based on this dilemma, we propose to construct a camera that mimics the perception of laser <b>dazzle</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> human eye as close as possible. The human eye camera consists of hardware and a software component, which perform the several tasks of the eye. The hardware controls the eye-movement (saccadic viewing), the adaption of the iris (irradiance control) and the projection of the image onto a sensor. The software receives <b>the</b> image taken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sensor and includes the density of receptors, the retinal neural operations and a feedback to the hardware. <b>The</b> processed images <b>by</b> <b>the</b> virtual retina are meant to be used to evaluate the degree of dazzling, as it would occur to a human observer...|$|R

6000|$|... "The disk of {{the setting}} sun {{appeared}} like a globe of fire suspended over the savannah; and its last rays, as they swept the earth, illumined the extremities of the grass, strongly agitated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> evening breeze. In the low and humid places of the equinoxial zone, even when the gramineous plants and reeds present the aspect of a meadow, of turf, a rich decoration of the picture is usually wanting. I mean that variety of wild flowers which, scarcely rising above the grass, seem to lie upon a smooth bed of verdure. Between the tropics, the strength and luxury of vegetation give such a development to plants, that the smallest of the dicotyledonous family become shrubs.[62] It would seem as if the {214} liliaceous plants, mingled with the gramina, assumed the place of the flowers of our meadows. Their form is indeed striking; they <b>dazzle</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> variety and splendor of their colours; but, too high above the soil, they disturb that harmonious relation which exists among the plants that compose our meadows and our turf. Nature, in her beneficence, has given the landscape under every zone its peculiar type of beauty.|$|R
40|$|The high angular {{resolution}} provided by adaptive optics allows {{detailed study of}} the environment of bright objects such as stars or AGNs, provided that <b>dazzling</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> direct and scattered light from the central source does not become the main limitation. Masking the bright source with a coronagrab {{is the way to}} alle- viate this problem. Rabbia and Gay (this conference) propose a possible solution. We recently described another concept of faint object coronagraph using a phase mask with 4 quadrants, which presents an excellent rejection factor, and that can be rather easily made achromatic. We propose to install such a device within the NAOS/CONICA in- strument. We first examine the properties of this device in terms of rejection gain versus the different factors (residual AO phase error, central obscuration, chromatism). We estimate the performances under different conditions of adaptive optics correction with NAOS/CONICA and of phase errors due to chromatism within the K band. Results of realistic simulations at K show that a gain of 10 - 12 magnitude is reachable. We finally describe some technical aspects of the mask manufacturing and achromatisation using two dispersive materials, as well as the implementation of the 4 QC within CONICA...|$|R
6000|$|One fine February day, {{when the}} sun had reassumed some of its genial power, I walked in the forest with my family. It {{was one of those}} lovely winter-days which assert the {{capacity}} of nature to bestow beauty on barrenness. The leafless trees spread their fibrous branches against the pure sky; their intricate and pervious tracery resembled delicate sea-weed; the deer were turning up the snow in search of the hidden grass; the white was made intensely <b>dazzling</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sun, and trunks of the trees, rendered more conspicuous <b>by</b> <b>the</b> loss of preponderating foliage, gathered around like the labyrinthine columns of a vast temple; it was impossible not to receive pleasure from the sight of these things. Our children, freed from the bondage of winter, bounded before us; pursuing the deer, or rousing the pheasants and partridges from their coverts. Idris leant on my arm; her sadness yielded to the present sense of pleasure. We met other families on the Long Walk, enjoying like ourselves the return of the genial season. At once, I seemed to awake; I cast off the clinging sloth of the past months; earth assumed a new appearance, and my view of the future was suddenly made clear. I exclaimed, [...] "I have now found out the secret!" ...|$|R

6000|$|I observed, however, {{that one}} of them held {{somewhat}} aloof, and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a sleeping partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth <b>dazzling</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favorite with them, they raised a cry of [...] "Bulkington! Bulkington! where's Bulkington?" [...] and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.|$|R
