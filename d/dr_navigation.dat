40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) navigation system determines whether they can safely operate and return. Traditional Dead-reckoning (DR) relies on the inertial sensors such as gyroscope and accelerometer. A major challenge for <b>DR</b> <b>navigation</b> is from measurement error of the inertial sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, etc.), especially when the AUV is near or at the ocean surface. The AUV&# 39;s motion is affected by ocean waves, and its pitch angle changes rapidly with the waves. This rapid change and the measurement errors will cause great noise to the direction measured by gyroscopes, and then lead to a large error to the <b>DR</b> <b>navigation.</b> To address this problem, a novel DR method based on neural network (DR-N) is proposed to explore the time-varying relationship between acceleration measurement and orientation measurement, which leverages acoustic localization and neural network estimate timely pitch angle through the explored time-varying relationship. This method enables AUV&# 39;s <b>DR</b> <b>navigation</b> with a single acceleration, without relying on both acceleration and gyroscope. Most importantly, we can improve the {{accuracy of}} AUV navigation through avoiding DR errors caused by gyroscope noise at the sea surface. Simulations show DR-N significantly improves navigation accuracy.

40|$|Abstract: For vehicle {{integrated}} navigation systems, real-time estimating {{states of}} the dead reckoning (DR) unit {{is much more difficult}} than that of the other measuring sensors under the indefinite noises and nonlinear characteristics. Compared with the well known extended Kalman filter (EKF), a recurrent neural network is proposed for the solution, which not only improves the location precision, the adaptive ability of resisting disturbances, but also avoids calculating the analytic derivation and Jacobian matrices of the nonlinear system model. In order to test the performances of the recurrent neural network, these two methods are used to estimate {{states of the}} vehicle <b>DR</b> <b>navigation</b> system. Simulation results show the recurrent neural network is superior to the EKF and is a more ideal filtering method for vehicle <b>DR</b> <b>navigation.</b> Key words: dead reckoning; extended Kalman filter; recurrent neural network; vehicle integrated navigation systems 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a terrain-aided re-navigation algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) built around optimizing bottom-lock Doppler velocity log (DVL) tracklines {{relative to a}} ship derived bathymetric map. The goal of this work {{is to improve the}} precision of AUV DVLbased navigation for near-seafloor science by removing the lowfrequency “drift” associated with a dead-reckoned (<b>DR)</b> Doppler <b>navigation</b> methodology. To do this, we use the discrepancy between vehicle-derived vs. ship-derived acoustic bathymetry as a corrective error measure in a standard nonlinear optimization framework. The advantage of this re-navigation methodology is that it exploits existing ship-derived bathymetric maps to improve vehicle navigation without requiring additional infrastructure. We demonstrate our technique for a recent AUV survey of largescale gas blowout features located along the U. S. Atlantic margin...|$|R

40|$|The {{prototype}} {{of a personal}} navigator to support navigation and tracking of military and rescue ground personnel has been developed at The Ohio State University Satellite Positioning and Inertial Navigation (SPIN) Laboratory. This paper provides {{a review of the}} navigation techniques suitable for personal navigation and follows with design, implementation and performance assessment of the system prototype, with a special emphasis on the dead-reckoning (<b>DR)</b> <b>navigation</b> supported by the human locomotion model. An adaptive knowledge system (KBS) based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Fuzzy Logic (FL) has been implemented to support this functionality. The KBS is trained a priori using sensory data collected by various operators in various environments during the GPS signal reception, and is used to support navigation under GPS-denied conditions. The primary components of the human locomotion model are step frequency (SF) and step length (SL). SL is determined by a predictive model derived by the KBS during the system’s calibration/training period. SL is correlated with several sensory and environmental data types, such as acceleration, acceleration variation, SF, terrain slope, operator’s height, etc. that constitute the input parameters to the KBS system. The KBS-predicted SL, together with the heading information provided by the magnetometer and/or gyroscope, supports the <b>DR</b> <b>navigation.</b> The current target accuracy of the system is 3 - 5 m CEP (circular error probable, 50 %). A summary of the performance analysis in the mixed indoor-outdoor environments, with the special emphasis on the DR performance is provided. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{personal}} navigator (PN) prototype, {{developed at}} The Ohio State University Satellite Positioning and Inertial navigation (SPIN) Laboratory, integrates GPS, tactical grade {{inertial measurement unit}} (IMU), digital magnetometer compass, digital barometer, and uses a human locomotion model to support dead reckoning (<b>DR)</b> <b>navigation</b> for rescue work, security and emergency services, police safety and military applications. The human locomotion model is represented here by the step length (SL) and step direction (SD). In the absence of GPS signals, the SL is predicted by a knowledge-based system (KBS) {{in the form of}} artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy logic (FL), while the SD is directly measured by the magnetometer and gyro IMU and modeled by a special module of a Kalman Filter, referred to as DR-KF. If the duration of a GPS outage is prolonged, the gyro and to some extent the magnetometer sensor errors will increase due to lack of updated calibration parameters that may result in an unacceptable level of navigation error. The current target accuracy of the system is 3 - 5 m circular error probable, 50 % (CEP), where the navigation performance depends predominantly on the quality of SD estimation. In thi...|$|E
