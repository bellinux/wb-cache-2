5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated <b>here</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subclass of aggressive mimicry.|$|E

At that junction, the Sixth Avenue express tracks turn west under 53rd Street, just {{to the south of}} the Queens Boulevard Line. The two lines share platforms at Seventh Avenue, but no connecting tracks are present.|$|E

25|$|Musicalische Ergötzung ("Musical Delight") {{is a set}} of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo {{published}} {{sometime after}} 1695.

Synephrine constrictions were also antagonized by BRL-15,572, but not by SB-216,641 (used <b>here</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> selective 5-HT1B antagonist), or by propranolol (a common β antagonist).|$|E

25|$|Lesbian {{feminism}} typically situates {{the state}} of being a lesbian {{as a form of}} resistance to patriarchal institutions. Sexual orientation is posited <b>here</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> choice, or at least a conscious response to a situation. It is also seen as a critique of male supremacy, chauvinism, and masculinity in general. Lesbian separatism is a form of separatist feminism specific to lesbians. In separatist feminism, lesbianism is posited as a key feminist strategy that enables women to invest their energies in other women, creating new space and dialogue about women's relationships, and typically limits their dealings with men.|$|E
25|$|PTFE film is also {{widely used}} in the {{production}} of carbon fiber composites as well as fiberglass composites, notably in the aerospace industry. PTFE film is used as a barrier between the carbon or fiberglass part being built, and breather and bagging materials used to incapsulate the bondment when debulking (vacuum removal of air from between layers of laid-up plies of material) and when curing the composite, usually in an autoclave. The PTFE, used <b>here</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> film, prevents the non-production materials from sticking to the part being built, which is sticky due to the carbon-graphite or fiberglass plies being pre-pregnated with bismaleimide resin. Non-production materials such as Teflon, Airweave Breather and the bag itself would be considered F.O.D. (foreign object debris/damage) if left in layup.|$|E
25|$|Understanding and {{describing}} {{change is a}} common theme in the natural sciences, and calculus was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it. Functions arise <b>here,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of real numbers and functions of a real variable is known as real analysis, with complex analysis the equivalent field for the complex numbers. Functional analysis focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) spaces of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is quantum mechanics. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as differential equations. Many phenomena in nature can be described by dynamical systems; chaos theory makes precise {{the ways in which}} many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still deterministic behavior.|$|E

25|$|Trading {{links between}} the United States and the East India Company's territories began when the American ship Chesapeake sailed up the Hooghly to anchor in Calcutta in 1786, just {{ten years after the}} United States Declaration of Independence. On 19 November 1792, the then American President George Washington {{appointed}} Benjamin Joy, a businessman from Newburyport, Massachusetts, as the first American Consul to India. With the advice of the then Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, later the third President of the United States and consent of the Senate, President Washington commissioned Joy to that office on 21 November 1792. When Joy reached Calcutta in April 1794, the colonial government repudiated his commission. However, he was permitted to 'reside <b>here</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Commercial Agent subject to the Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction of this Country...', and he stayed in Calcutta and served as the commercial agent of the American government.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th {{century the}} {{availability}} of land, large houses and tolerance to dissenters made Homerton a popular place to found institutions. The educational ones were commonly known as Dissenting Academies. The Kings Head Society moved to a large house here in 1768, forming Homerton College {{for the education of}} Calvinist ministers with between 12-20 students. Religious education moved to the new University College London in 1826, but Homerton College remained <b>here</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> teacher training college until 1896, when it moved to Cambridge, eventually becoming a full college of the University of Cambridge in 2010. Students from Homerton college were principal in forming, in 1881, both the Glynn Cricket Club and Clapton Orient - which became Leyton Orient F.C. on its move to Leyton. The buildings of the College were rebuilt and expanded several times, but eventually lost to bomb damage in World War II.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Fiona Buffini {{directed}} a touring production for the RSC. Premiering at the Swan, the production starred Alex Avery as Valentine, Laurence Mitchell as Proteus, Vanessa Ackerman as Julia and Rachel Pickup as Silvia. Buffini set the {{play in a}} swinging 1930s milieu, and featuring numerous dance numbers. Additionally, London and New York replaced Verona and Milan; initially, Valentine and Proteus are shown as living in the English countryside, in a rural paradise devoid of any real vitality, the sons of wealthy families who have retired from the city. When Valentine leaves, he heads to New York to pursue the American Dream and {{falls in love with}} Silvia, the famous actress daughter of a powerful media magnate. Another change to the play was that the roles of the outlaws (represented <b>here</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group of paparazzi) were increased considerably. Scenes added to the play show them arriving in New York and going about their daily business, although none of the new scenes featured any dialogue. Another performance worth noting occurred at the Courtyard Theatre in Stratford in 2006. A non-professional acting company from Brazil, named Nós do Morro, in collaboration with a Gallery 37 group from Birmingham, gave a single performance of the play during the RSC's presentation of the Complete Works, directed by Guti Fraga. The production was spoken in Portuguese, with the original English text projected as surtitles onto the back of the stage. It also featured two 17-year-olds in the roles of Valentine and Proteus (usually, actors in their 20s are cast), and Crab was played not by a dog, but by a human actor in a dog costume. In 2009, Joe Dowling directed the play at the Guthrie Theater, starring Sam Bardwell as Valentine, Jonas Goslow as Proteus, Sun Mee Chomet as Julia and Valeri Mudek as Silvia. Staged as a 1950s live television production, large black-and-white monitors were set {{on either side of the}} stage, with cameras feeding the action to them. Additionally, period advertisements appeared both before the show and during the intermission. The actors spoke the original dialogue, but wore 1950s clothing. Rock and roll music and dance sequences were occasionally mixed with the action.|$|E
