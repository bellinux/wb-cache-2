At least four volcanic formations along the British Columbia Coast are associated with Cascadia subduction zone volcanism. The oldest is the eroded 18-million-year-old Pemberton Volcanic Belt which extends west-northwest from south-central British Columbia to the Queen Charlotte Islands in the northeast where it lies [...] west of mainland British Columbia. In the south it is defined by a group of epizonal intrusions and a few erosional remnants of <b>eruptive</b> <b>rock.</b> Farther north in the large Ha-Iltzuk and Waddington icefields, it includes two large dissected calderas called Silverthrone Caldera and Franklin Glacier Volcano while the Queen Charlotte Islands to the northeast contain a volcanic formation ranging in age from Miocene to Pliocene called the Masset Formation. Although widely separated from each other, all Pemberton Belt rocks are of similar age and have similar magma compositions. Therefore, these magmatic rocks are believed to be products of arc volcanism related to subduction of the Farallon Plate. By late Pliocene time the Farallon Plate had been greatly reduced in size and its northern portion ultimately broke off between five and seven million years ago to form a new plate boundary called the Nootka Fault. This rupture created the two small Juan de Fuca and Explorer plates that lie off the west coast of Vancouver Island.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} analysis by EMP/EDS of 140 samples in cores from six Red Sea troughs and basins {{has led to}} the discovery in the Nereus Deep of high vanadium concentrations (up to 1. 3 % V 2 O 3) in several bulk samples, and to the isolation of a major magnetite phase. This vanado-magnetite, remarkable for its high content of vanadium (mean = 1. 45 % V 2 O 3) and its lack of titanium is frequently zoned, the V-content decreasing toward the outer zones. Oxides with up to 42 % V 2 O 3, have also been found. Since the origin of the magnetite is clearly authigenic, its high vanadium and low titanium concentrations are traced back to the differential hydrothermal leaching of Fe-Ti-oxides which occur profusely in basic <b>eruptive</b> <b>rock</b> clasts, actually present in some of the overlying seams. -AuthorsSCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The rate of {{ascent of}} the thermal {{perturbation}} of <b>eruptive</b> <b>rock</b> {{types in the}} Kenya Dome region can be calculated for depths of origin ranging from greater than 170 km to the lower crust (25 - 30 km) as combined with dated occurrences. An equation is derived and solved iteratively for ascent velocity at 10 km depth intervals from 150 - 30 km, assuming a thermal diffusivity of 1 sq mm/sec. For radii of 50 and 100 km and constant gradient increases within the range 55 - 60 C/km over the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) ascent depth range, the calculated rate of upwelling corresponds well {{with the results of}} a simple thermal model of lithospheric thinning. A 1 C/km change in gradient results approximately in a 0. 55 Myr change in ascent time from 150 to 30 km, due to the increasing differential between the geotherm and the solidus with decreasing depths and the increasing rate of heat loss to the surface. It is suggested by the temporal-spatial-compositional relations of eruptives in the Kenya Dome region that there is a shallowing of magma source regions with time, implying encroachment of a thermal anomaly...|$|E
