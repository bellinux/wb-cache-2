40|$|Even with optimal {{system design}} and careful choice of {{topology}} {{for a particular}} RF application, large amounts of energy are often wasted due to low-quality passives, especially inductors. Inductors have traditionally been difficult to integrate due to their inherent low quality factors and modelling complexity.
