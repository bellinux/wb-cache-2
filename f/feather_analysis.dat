40|$|In The Netherlands, all {{antibiotic}} treatments {{should be}} registered {{at the farm}} and in a central database. To enforce correct antibiotic use and registration, and to enforce prudent use of antibiotics, {{there is a need}} for methods that are able to detect antibiotic treatments. Ideally, such a method is able to detect antibiotic applications during the entire lifespan of an animal, including treatments administered during the first days of the animals’ lives. Monitoring tissue, as is common practice, only provides a limited window of opportunity, as residue levels in tissue soon drop below measurable quantities. The analysis of feathers proves to be a promising tool in this respect. Furthermore, a qualitative confirmatory method was developed for the analyses of six major groups of antibiotics in ground chicken feathers, aiming for a detection limit as low as reasonably possible. The method was validated according to Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. All compounds comply with the criteria and, as a matter of fact, 58 % of the compounds could also be quantified according to regulations. Additionally, we demonstrated that a less laborious method, in which whole feathers were analyzed, proved successful in the detection of applied antibiotics. Most compounds could be detected at levels of 2 μg kg− 1 or below with the exception of sulfachloropyridazine, tylosin, and tylvalosin. This demonstrates the effectiveness of <b>feather</b> <b>analysis</b> to detect antibiotic use to allow effective enforcement of antibiotic use and prevent the illegal, off-label, and nonregistered use of antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Studies of the {{patterns}} of diversification of birds on islands have contributed {{a great deal to}} the development of evolutionary theory. In white-winged fairy-wrens, Maluras leucopterus, mainland males develop a striking blue nuptial plumage whereas those on nearby islands develop black nuptial plumage. We explore the proximate basis for this divergence by combining microstructural <b>feather</b> <b>analysis</b> with an investigation of genetic variation at the melanocortin- 1 receptor locus (MC 1 R). Fourier analysis revealed that the medullary keratin matrix (spongy layer) of the feather barbs of blue males was ordered at the appropriate nanoscale to produce the observed blue colour by coherent light scattering. Surprisingly, the feather barbs of black males also contained a spongy layer that could produce a similar blue colour. However, black males had more melanin in their barbs than blue males, and this melanin may effectively mask any structural colour produced by the spongy layer. Moreover, the presence of this spongy layer suggests that black island males evolved from a blue-plumaged ancestor. We also document concordant patterns of variation at the MC 1 R locus, as five amino acid substitutions were perfectly associated with the divergent blue and black plumage phenotypes. Thus, with the possible involvement of a melanocortin receptor locus, increased melanin density may mask the blue-producing microstructure in black island males, resulting in the divergence of plumage coloration between mainland and island white-winged fairy-wrens. Such mechanisms may also be responsible for plumage colour diversity across broader geographical and evolutionary scales...|$|E
40|$|A Study of Mercury in Bald Eagle Feathers and Quills Student: Wendy Cecil Mentor: Dr. Cathleen Webb (WKU Department of Chemistry) Methylmercury is a {{naturally}} occurring and toxic form of mercury which may biomagnify through {{the food chain}} and bioaccumulate in individuals. This study examined a full body loading and mercury analysis completed for 33 feathers including tail feathers, primary feathers and breast feathers within a single, individual bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). Mercury analysis was completed using an AMA 254 Mercury Thermal Analyzer for feather tissue and quill samples. Of all samples analyzed in this project, approximately 46 % were quality assurance and quality control samples. Feathers are commonly analyzed for contaminants in avians. Quill analysis has not been reported {{in any of the}} related literature. This study is the first study to report analysis of feather quills for mercury in bald eagles or in any other avian species. An implicit assumption of the literature seems to be that the quills are of no significant interest because the mercury levels are low. This study reports elevated levels of mercury in both bald eagle feathers and quills. Feathers ranged in mercury concentration from 7. 8 ± 1. 6 ppm Hg to 30. 4 ± 5. 2 ppm Hg. Feather quills ranged from 8. 0 ± 2. 3 ppm Hg to 34. 3 ± 10. 9 ppm Hg. The average quill mercury concentration, 15. 1 ppm Hg, is actually quite high and is, for individual feathers, correlated with the mercury levels in the vein portion of the feather. The discovery that feather quills contain measurable concentrations of mercury may revolutionize <b>feather</b> <b>analysis</b> and has the potential to expand opportunity for future research...|$|E

The darker portions of the flight feather were enriched with Zn and Fe, which supports the suggestion that feather melanins are efficient ligands of some metals found in the environment, sequestering potentially harmful particles away from the body.

Recent behavioral and neurophysiological evidence indicates that while they are all relevant for manipulable artifact concepts, semantic relations based on thematic (e. g., saw-wood), specific function similarity (e. g., saw-axe), and general function similarity (e. g., saw-knife) are differently processed, and may relate to different levels of action representation. Point-light displays of object-related actions previously encoded at the gesture level (e. g., "sawing") or at the higher level of action representation (e. g., "cutting") were used as primes before participants identified target objects (e. g., saw) among semantically related and unrelated distractors (e. g., wood, <b>feather,</b> piano). <b>Analysis</b> of eye movements on the different objects during target identification informed about the amplitude and the timing of implicit activation of the different semantic relations. Results showed that action prime encoding impacted the processing of thematic relations, but not that of functional similarity relations. Semantic competition with thematic distractors was greater and earlier following action primes encoded at the gesture level compared to action primes encoded at higher level.

The experimental set up involved 200 featherless chicks and 200 feathered sibs reared under hot conditions in two rooms (average temperature from 29 - 33 °C) divided into pens by genotype and diets (standard diet and 10 %, 15 % and 20 % protein and energy reduction). Traits measured were body weight at slaughter and breast meat yield in grams while the percent breast meat yield was calculated. Quality traits measured were breast meat colour lightness (L*) and redness (a*); and the calculated were drip loss % (24 - 72 h) PM and thaw loss % (24 - 72 h) PM on 56 featherless and 39 <b>feathered</b> sibs. <b>Analysis</b> of variance was performed with SAS software using GLM procedure. Applying the truncation of lightness values: lighter than normal (L*> 53); the featherless birds had normal breast meat colour while their feathered sibs had lighter than normal (pale). The redness (a*) values of breast meat colour were significantly higher in featherless (3. 22) than in their feathered sibs (2. 54). The better meat and specifically breast meat yield in the featherless (with normal breast meat colour) as compared to those of their feathered sibs under hot conditions was associated with quality traits such as higher water holding capacity as assessed by significantly lower drip loss (1. 27 % vs 1. 83 %; P= 0. 0003) and thaw loss (2. 28 % vs 3. 35 %; P<. 0001). Thus, it is concluded that the reduction in meat yield and quality of the fast-growing normally feathered birds under hot condition, can be counteracted by the introduction of the scaleless (sc) gene for efficient production of better quality broiler meat in hot climates...|$|R

40|$|A {{temporal}} {{separation of}} energetically costly life history events like reproduction {{and maintenance of}} the integumentary system {{is thought to be}} promoted by selection to avoid trade-offs and maximize fitness. It has therefore remained somewhat of a paradox that certain vertebrate species can undergo both events simultaneously. Identifying potential costs of overlapping two demanding life history stages will further our understanding of the selection pressures that shape the temporal regulation of life history events in vertebrates. We studied free-living tropical Slaty brush-finches (Atlapetes schistaceus), in which individuals spontaneously overlap reproduction and moult or undergo both events in separation.

Blue Swallows from the three major breeding populations differed significantly in terms of their feather δD and δ 15 N values (South Africa / Swaziland: δD = - 25. 1 ± 6. 7 ‰ VSMOW, δ 15 N = 10. 4 ± 1. 0 ‰ AIR; Zimbabwe: δD = - 59. 9 ± 7. 5 ‰ VSMOW, δ 15 N = 10. 1 ± 0. 6 ‰ AIR; Malawi / Tanzania: δD = - 43. 2 ± 10. 8 ‰ VSMOW, δ 15 N = 11. 7 ± 1. 3 ‰ AIR), but not in terms of feather δ 13 C. We also analysed feathers from seven individuals caught in the non-breeding range on the shores of Lake Victoria in Uganda. A discriminant function analysis assigned four of these birds to the South Africa / Swaziland breeding population and two to the Malawi / Tanzania breeding population (p > 0. 997), with the remaining individual not being unambiguously assigned. Our results reveal that migratory connections in this threatened species can be inferred from <b>feather</b> stable isotope <b>analysis,</b> and that there is overlap in the wintering ranges of {{at least two of the}} three major breeding populations...|$|R
40|$|The Powerful Owl (Ninox strenua) is {{endemic to}} Australia, being {{resident}} {{in the three}} eastern mainland states and the Australian Capital Territory. It is classified nationally as of conservation significance and vulnerable {{in the state of}} Victoria. The elusive nature of this owl, along with its dispersed distribution, low population density and difficulty in identifying individual birds, limit the collection of ecological data. Molecular methods can be used to obtain crucial ecological information, essential for Powerful Owl conservation. Non-invasive sampling is a relatively new method used for obtaining genetic material from free-ranging animals. This type of sampling however, is generally overlooked as a potential DNA source. Shed hair and feathers, faeces, urine, skins and eggshells are all potential sources of DNA. Non-invasive sampling regimes may be the only alternative for the genetic analysis of endangered and/or elusive species that are difficult to sample otherwise. Powerful Owls moult annually. Shed feathers therefore, can be collected from under roost trees and used for genetic <b>analysis.</b> <b>Feathers</b> collected provide DNA that is unique to the individual and can provide additional ecological knowledge of the species. In this study we collected shed Powerful Owl feathers during 2003 and 2004. In order to obtain samples from across the owl 2 ̆ 7 s large distribution, public awareness about the project via the way of flyers, mail-outs, media sources (radio, newspapers and magazines), email lists and public seminars was initiated. Overall, the collection strategy was very successful with over 500 Powerful Owl feather samples being collected. Genetic information obtained from the analysis of DNA from feathers can enable a more rigorous assessment of population viability of the Powerful Owl. Specifically designed molecular markers will facilitate unequivocal identification of individual birds ("DNA fingerprinting"). Through the application of molecular techniques we can collect ecological information about the Powerful Owl such as, genetic divergence, population structure, dispersal patterns, migration and inbreeding. These questions can not be addressed via traditional data collection and will contribute significantly to the successful conservation of the Powerful Owl and potentially other raptor species. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) is a {{single-stranded}} DNA {{virus that}} is the etiological agent of beak and feather disease in both wild and captive parrots. Given that BFDV is globally recognized as a conservation threat for wild parrots, between 2011 - 2013, red-crowned parakeets (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae, n = 229), which are endemic to New Zealand, were captured in mist nets on Tiritiri Matangi Island and Hauturu-o-Toi/Little Barrier Island (LBI), New Zealand, for disease surveillance. Blood and feathers from all birds were tested by PCR for BFDV, and full genomes were recovered and sequenced. A subset of blood samples (n = 96) were tested for antibodies to BFDV by the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. A further 238 feather samples were obtained from red-crowned parakeets from three sites in the Wellington region of the North Island, and these were screened for BFDV. The DNA-based prevalence of BFDV infection determined on Tiritiri Matangi Island was 1. 09 % (CI 95 %, 0. 1 - 3. 9 %); on Hauturu-o-Toi/LBI, 4. 4 % (95 % CI, 0. 5 %- 15. 1 %); on Kapiti Island, 3. 4 % (CI 95 %, 1. 1 - 7. 8 %); at the ZEALANDIA-Karori sanctuary, 1. 6 % (95 % CI, 0 - 8. 4 %); and on Matiu-Somes Island, 0 % (CI 95 %, 0 - 12. 3 %). Seroprevalence for BFDV, indicating prior or current exposure, in the Tiritiri Matangi Island population, it was 2 % (CI 95 %, 0 - 10. 1 %), and in the Hauturu-o-Toi/LBI population was 14 % (CI 95 %, 5. 3 - 27. 9 %). BFDV-positive birds {{showed no signs of}} clinical disease, with the exception of an individual bird obtained opportunistically from Shakespear Regional Park during the study period, which had classical signs of <b>feather</b> loss. Phylogenetic <b>analysis</b> of the 11 full genome sequences recovered from BFDV-positive red-crowned parakeets revealed evidence of ongoing viral flow between red-crowned parakeets and eastern rosellas (Platycercus eximius) in the Hauraki Gulf/Auckland region, with separate but closely related strains from the Wellington region of the North Island. This is the first study to report HI results for a New Zealand endemic parrot species, and the first epidemiological analysis of serial cross-sectional surveys in a BFDV-infected population of red-crowned parakeets in New Zealand. We postulate that although BFDV remains a threat to small, isolated or naïve populations of parrots globally, the low viral prevalence in this and other studies suggests that native parakeets in New Zealand may act as dead-end or spillover hosts...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{presented}} as three independent sections, all dealing with the interaction of light with organic materials in the solid state. Section 1, consisting of chapters 1 and 2, deals with molecular gyroscopes: a class of amphidynamic materials. Molecular gyroscopes mimic the architecture of their macroscopic namesakes, having a freely rotating component (the rotator) surrounded and shielded by bulky static groups (the stators). Chapter 1 explores {{the development of a}} molecular gyroscope which contains the phenyleneethynylene chromophore along its axis of rotation. Chapter 2 discusses the phenyleneethynylene containing molecular gyroscopes with dipolar rotators. Chapter 3 presents a detailed characterization of the photodegradation of bird feathers. Chapter 4 examines the solid-state photodecarbonylation of tetraphenylacetone by laser flash photolysis. A more in-depth look at the contents of each chapter follows:Chapter 1. Reports the synthesis, crystal structure, solid-state dynamics, and photophysical properties of 6, 13 -bis((4 -(3 -(3 -methoxyphenyl) - 3, 3 -diphenylprop- 1 -yn- 1 -yl) phenyl) ethynyl) - 5, 7, 12, 14 -tetrahydro- 5, 14 : 7, 12 -bis([1, 2]benzeno) pentacene (1), a molecular dirotor with a phenyleneethynylene chromophore. The incorporation of a pentiptycene into the molecular dirotor provides a central stator and a fixed phenylene ring relative to which the two flanking ethynylphenylene rotators can explore various torsion angles; this allows the phenyleneethynylene fluorophore dynamics to persist in the solid state. X-Ray diffraction studies show that molecular dirotor 1 packs so that all the phenyleneethynylene fluorophores adopt a parallel alignment, this is ideal for the development of functional materials. Variable temperature, quadrupolar echo 2 H-NMR studies show that phenylene rotator flipping has an activation energy of 9. 0 kcal/mol and a room temperature flipping frequency of ~ 2. 6 MHz. Lastly, with measurements in solution, glasses and crystals, evidence was obtained that the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of the phenyleneethynylene chromophores is dependent on the extent of conjugation between the phenylene rings, as determined by their relative dihedral angles. Chapter 2. The molecular gyroscope architecture developed in chapter 1 is further elaborated to include a dipolar rotator. This is the first example of molecular gyroscopes that incorporate both the phenyleneethynylene chromophore and dipolar rotators. While the initial dipolar rotator design lead to molecules which failed to crystalize, a redesigned rotator gave crystals which were isomorphic with those discussed in chapter 1 and therefore retained the desired parallel alignment. Intriguingly, the optical properties of the dipolar molecular gyroscopes were less variable than those of their nonpolar parent compound. Chapter 3. A study of the photo-induced degradation of bird feathers is performed. Unpigmented turkey feathers and carotenoid pigmented scarlet ibis feathers are aged in ultraviolet light, filtered sunlight, and UV-free museum lighting. Aged feathers are examined and photographed under both visible light and UV light; photo-induced changes that are readily apparent under UV illumination are undetectable under ordinary illumination. Aged feathers are characterized by XPS, FTIR, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Spectral changes caused by light aging are qualitatively similar to previously reported changes in light aged wool spectra and are indicative of increasing concentrations of cystine oxidation products in UV aged <b>feathers.</b> GCMS <b>analysis</b> confirms that the cysteic acid to cystine ratio increases with UV exposure. Pigment concentration decreases with exposure to both visible and UV light and loss of pigment is detectable by <b>analysis</b> of <b>feather</b> extract long before visible changes are observed in feathers. Chapter 4. The first transient absorbance spectra and kinetic data for the photodecarbonylation of a dibenzyl ketone derivative in a microcrystalline suspension are reported. While this class of reaction has been extensively studied under other conditions (solutions, micelles, and in zeolites) the synthetic utility of the solid-state version made it worthy of additional scrutiny. A protocol for the preparation of minimally scattering microcrystalline suspensions of TPA is reported; the crystal packing of these suspensions is similar the bulk powder. Product analysis has shown that while these reactions go cleanly to TPE in the solid state, benzophenone is the major product in solution. The transient absorbance signal for TPA in microcrystalline suspension is slightly (10 nm) red shifted verses the solution spectrum, and the transient lifetimes are significantly longer...|$|R
40|$|Dentro das perspectivas da Hist?ria Cultural este trabalho prop?e uma an?lise de um documento chave para a Hist?ria da Inquisi??o em Portugal: o Regimento inquisitorial de 1640. Esse c?digo inquisitorial vigorou durante 134 anos dos 285 anos de Inquisi??o em Portugal, foi compilado durante o conturbado processo de Restaura??o do trono lusitano e substitu?do no fim do controverso per?odo pombalino. Durante mais de um s?culo o Regimento ditou as regras e pr?ticas processuais do Santo Of?cio lusitano, seus ritos e etiquetas, suas cerim?nias p?blicas e particulares; regulou sobre a aplica??o das penas e serviu de par?metro moral e religioso no controle pedag?gico da Inquisi??o sob a sociedade lusitana e suas col?nias. Procuramos descrever o Regimento de 1640 como fruto de um longo processo hist?rico. Abordamos a ideia de Direito e Intoler?ncia que foram se amoldando de acordo com os cen?rios econ?micos, sociais e pol?ticos que se reconfiguravam constantemente pela Europa durante as Idades M?dia e Moderna e, a partir dessas mudan?as hist?ricas, percorremos o longo caminhar da Inquisi??o Moderna em Portugal; suas influ?ncias, lutas, embates, rela??es de poder e impactos socioculturais. Tra?amos um breve hist?rico dos c?digos inquisitoriais, partindo de uma an?lise comparativa para melhor nos situarmos em rela??o ?s mudan?as legais que convergiram no Regimento de 1640. Contextualizamos o momento de elabora??o do c?digo regimental de 1640. Analisamos os entraves e contextos da Ib?ria e os agentes reais e inquisitoriais que se moviam no intricado jogo diplom?tico que redesenhava as fronteiras independentes entre Portugal e Espanha. Exploramos a import?ncia de figuras centrais da Inquisi??o de Portugal durante as contendas pela Restaura??o portuguesa. Detalhamos cada um dos tr?s livros que comp?e o c?digo regimental, o livro dos funcion?rios, o livro das pr?ticas processuais e o livro das penas. A an?lise dos livros foi elaborada com a inten??o de apresentar a min?cia regimental, o rico detalhamento do Direito Inquisitorial e suas justificativas para aplica??o de suas pr?ticas e penas espec?ficas. Ao historicizarmos o Direito Inquisitorial, verificamos sua proximidade com o Direito Can?nico e sua influ?ncia na elabora??o futura de um Direito laico, erudito e escrito. Em Portugal, os limites da Justi?a Inquisitorial e a Justi?a Secular durante os s?culos XVI, XVII e XVIII n?o eram claros, os olhos atentos dos agentes reais e dos agentes da f?, em muitas oportunidades, caminharam juntos em suas inspe??es no territ?rio portugu?s e suas col?nias. A C?ria romana e a Coroa portuguesa dividiam suas influ?ncias sob as fei??es inquisitoriais, o poder real aplicava seu poder pol?tico e econ?mico dentro de uma perspectiva regionalizada e o papado delineava as atribui??es legais e administrativas do Santo Of?cio utilizando-se de sua for?a supranacional. Within the {{perspective}} of Cultural History this research proposes an analysis of a very important document for the History of the Inquisition in Portugal: the inquisitorial Regiment of 1640. This inquisitorial code lasted for 134 years of the 285 years of the Inquisition in Portugal, was compiled during the troubled process of restoration of the portuguese throne and replaced {{at the end of}} the controversial Pombal s period. For more than a century the Regiment dictated procedural rules and practices of the Holy Office lusitanian, their rites and labels, your public and private ceremonies; regulated on the application of punishments and served as a moral and religious teaching in the parameter control of the Inquisition under the lusitanian society and its colonies. We have described the Regiment of 1640 as the result of a long historical process. We discuss the idea of Law and Intolerance that have been shaping up in accordance with the economic, social and political factors that are constantly reconfigured through Europe during the scenarios of Middle and Modern Ages and, from these historical changes, walked the long hike until the Modern Inquisition in Portugal; their influences, struggles, conflicts, power relations and socio-cultural impacts. We trace a brief history of the Inquisition s codes, through a comparative analysis in order to better situate in relation to legal changes that converged in the Regiment of 1640. We contextualize the time of writing of 1640 regimental code. We analyzed the obstacles and the contexts of Iberian Peninsula and the inquisitorial real agents who moved in the intricate diplomatic game to redraw the boundaries after the independence of Portugal from Spain. We explore the importance of the central figures of the Inquisition in Portugal during the Portuguese Restoration s strife. We detail each of the three books that make up the regimental code: the book of ministers and officials, the book of procedural practices and the book of <b>feathers.</b> The <b>analysis</b> of the books was made with the intention of presenting the regimental details, the rich detailing of Inquisitorial Law and its justifications for its practical and specific penalties applications. When we historicizing the Inquisitorial Law, we verified its proximity to the Canon Law and its influence on the future development of a secular, scholar and written Law. In Portugal, the limits of Inquisitorial Justice and Secular Justice during the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were not clear, observant of the of the monarchy s servants and agents of faith, on many occasions, their eyes walked together on their inspections in Portuguese territory and its colonies. The Roman Curia and the Portuguese Crown divided their influences under inquisitorial features, the real power applied its political and economic power within a regionalized perspective and the papacy outlined the legal and administrative functions of the Holy Office using its supranational power...|$|R
