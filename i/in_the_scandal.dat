5|$|From 1859 to 1865, Kogălniceanu was {{on several}} {{occasions}} the cabinet leader in the Moldavian half of the United Principalities, then Prime Minister of Romania, being {{responsible for most of}} the reforms associated with Cuza's reign. His first term in Moldavia ended during December 1860, when Kogălniceanu became involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal</b> involving Metropolitan Sofronie Miclescu, who opposed Cuza's secularization of the monastery estates. In 1863, secularization was imposed by Cuza, with the land thus freed being divided among peasants—the land reform of 1864, which came together with the universal abolition of corvées.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1983, Virginia Tech was placed on {{probation}} by the NCAA for violations stemming from illegal benefits given to players and potential recruits. The probation's main effect was to ban the players who received the benefits from participating in any postseason game following the 1984 season. Seven of the eight players involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal</b> either left Virginia Tech or had the probation lifted {{as a result of}} appeals to the NCAA. The eighth, Bruce Smith, did not.|$|E
5|$|Public {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal</b> eventually faded. Nevertheless, newspaper coverage reinforced {{negative attitudes}} about male homosexuality as an aristocratic vice, presenting the telegraph boys as corrupted and exploited {{by members of}} the upper class. This attitude reached its climax a few years later when Oscar Wilde was tried for gross indecency as the result of his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas.|$|E

50|$|Falconí, in his defense, {{said that}} most of his accusers were “proxies” of Roberto and William Isaías, former heads of Filanbanco. Another accuser of Falconí's, Assemblyman Abdalá Bucaram Pulley, {{questioned}} Falconí's candidacy on many grounds, including Falconí's role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> banking crisis and his involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandals</b> surrounding <b>the</b> Cofiec, Progreso, and Pacifico banks.|$|R

5|$|Investigating {{appropriations}} led Randall {{to focus}} on financial impropriety in Congress and the Grant administration. The most famous of these was the Crédit Mobilier scandal. In this scheme, the Union Pacific Railroad bankrupted itself by overpaying its construction company, the Crédit Mobilier of America. Crédit Mobilier was owned by the railroad's principal shareholders and, as the investigation discovered, several congressmen also owned shares {{that they had been}} allowed to purchase at discounted prices. Randall's role in the investigation was limited, but he proposed bills to ban such frauds and sought to impeach Vice President Schuyler Colfax, who had been implicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal.</b> Randall was involved with the investigation of several other scandals, as well, including tax fraud by private tax collection contractors (known as the Sanborn incident) and fraud in the awarding of postal contracts (the star route scandal).|$|E
5|$|Later in 1678, Danby was impeached by the House of Commons on {{the charge}} of high treason. Although {{much of the nation}} had sought war with Catholic France, Charles had {{secretly}} negotiated with Louis XIV, trying to reach an agreement under which England would remain neutral in return for money. Danby had publicly professed that he was hostile to France, but had reservedly agreed to abide by Charles's wishes. Unfortunately for him, the House of Commons failed to view him as a reluctant participant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal,</b> instead believing that he was the author of the policy. To save Danby from the impeachment trial, Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament in January 1679.|$|E
5|$|Sloan Gibson, who {{had been}} Acting Secretary between the time of Shinseki's {{resignation}} and McDonald's taking office, is now Deputy Secretary. He said on August 6, 2014 that more punishments were planned for VA officials for their roles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal.</b> The VA announced the week prior to Gibson's statement that two supervisors would be fired and four other employees would be disciplined for their roles in falsifying data in Colorado and Wyoming. The VA previously announced plans to fire three executives at the Phoenix VA. “These were the first in what I expect {{will be a long}} series of announcements of personnel actions,” said Gibson.|$|E

5|$|On June 9, Spivey {{was arrested}} in New York, and was {{released}} pending a trial, which started in January 1953. Hirsch testified that Spivey asked to be included as a point shaver, and was upset that the payment {{for his role in}} shaving during the 1950 Sugar Bowl game was less than he anticipated. This, however, contradicted his original grand jury testimony, which had no mention of Spivey's involvement. Hirsch also told the grand jury that Spivey and West, the ringleader, had not met. West declined to testify, leading to criminal contempt charges against him. Spivey again denied taking part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal,</b> stating that he had turned down a different gambler on two occasions. According to him, ex-teammate Jim Line mentioned his name to the grand jury; Spivey said he learned this from Line. The trial lasted for 13days before the case went to a jury. By a 9–3 margin, the majority of jurors supported acquittal for Spivey, and the hung jury caused a mistrial. The grand jury eventually dropped the charges against Spivey.|$|E
5|$|For {{eight months}} over 1875–76, the Prince of Wales was absent from Britain {{on a tour}} of India, but to her dismay Alexandra was left behind. The prince had planned an all-male group and {{intended}} to spend much of the time hunting and shooting. During the prince's tour, one of his friends who was travelling with him, Lord Aylesford, was told by his wife {{that she was going to}} leave him for another man: Lord Blandford, who was himself married. Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce. Meanwhile, Lord Blandford's brother, Lord Randolph Churchill, persuaded the lovers against an elopement. Now concerned by the threat of divorce, Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider. In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit, Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal.</b> Distressed at their threats, and following the advice of Sir William Knollys and the Duchess of Teck, Alexandra informed the queen, who then wrote to the Prince of Wales. The prince was incensed. Eventually, the Blandfords and the Aylesfords both separated privately. Although Lord Randolph Churchill later apologised, for years afterwards the Prince of Wales refused to speak to or see him.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{attacked}} the report as a , which they claimed read {{more like a}} legal defense than an objective investigation. They noted investigators could not interview any {{of the most important}} figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal,</b> and contended that Mastro had a conflict of interest since his firm was politically tied to Christie. Wisniewski and Weinberg, co-chairs of the legislature investigative committee, criticized the report as incomplete and potentially biased since it was prepared by lawyers hired by the Christie administration, and the lawyers did not interview key figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal.</b> Baroni, Kelly, Samson, Stepien, and Wildstein declined to be interviewed.|$|E
