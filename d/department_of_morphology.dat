40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} copaiba oil ointment (Copaifera langsdorffii) on dorsal skin flaps in rats. METHODS: Adult male rats (n= 30) were distributed into three groups of ten animals each, as follows: GC - control; GCA - absolute control and GT - treated with copaiba ointment. The rats were subjected to dorsal cutaneous skin flap surgery and the animals from the GC and GT received post-operative treatment for eight consecutive days. The animals from the GCA group did not receive treatment while the animals from the GC group received daily topical treatment of ointment without the active ingredient and the animals from the GT group were daily treated with 10 % copaiba oil ointment. At {{the end of each}} experimental period the lesions were evaluated according to the percentage of necrotic area. Then, fragments from cranial, median and caudal parts were fixed in Boüin's solution and processed for paraffin embedding. The morphology of histological sections (5 µm) was evaluated and the number of leucocytes, fibroblasts and blood vessels was also analyzed. The data obtained were submitted to ANOVA test complemented by Tukey-Kramer test (p GC and GT), while the morphology showed larger granulation tissue with bulky fibroblasts and collagen fibers more arranged in the GT group. The morphometry showed a significant higher number of blood vessels in the median and caudal parts (GT>GCA and GC), leucocytes in the cranial part (GT>GC>GCA), and also fibroblasts in the median (GT and GC> GCA) and caudal parts (GT>GC and GCA) (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The copaiba oil ointment favors angiogenesis and accelerates the viability of random skin flaps in rats.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the remote ischemic preconditioning (R-IPC) {{impact on the}} quality of the ovarian graft by means of vaginal smear of transplanted rats. METHODS: Sixty rats were used divided in six groups: Control; Fresh transplant (TxF); Cryopreserved transplant (TxC); R-IPC; R-IPC + fresh transplant (TxF+R-IPC); R-IPC + cryopreserved transplant (TxC+R-IPC). R-IPC was performed in the common iliac artery. Autologous ovarian tissue was implanted integrally in the retro peritoneum. On the first PO day, vaginal smear collection was daily initiated. After 30 days, the PO day when the estrous cycle was re-initiated was considered for analysis as well as the estrous days and the number of estrous cycles. RESULTS: R-IPC showed a tendency to an early estrus re-initiation (p> 0. 05) as well as increase the number of cycles in the fresh transplanted group while in the cryopreserved transplant the number of cycles was similar, regardless of the stimulus R-IPC (p> 0. 05). The animals which had undergone fresh grafts had a longer estrous period than the ones which had undergone cryopreserved grafts, with or without R-IPC (p 0, 05), assim como aumento no número de cilcos estrais nos grupos com transplante fresco enquanto que no criopreservado o número de ciclos foi semelhante, independente do PCI-R (p> 0, 05). Os animais que receberam enxertos frescos apresentaram mais dias na fase estro do que os criopreservados, com ou sem PCI-R. CONCLUSÃO: O PCI-R promoveu retorno mais precoce da atividade ovariana no PO e maior freqüência de estro, sendo os resultados mais consistentes nos enxertos frescos do que nos criopreservados.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the epidemiologic and morphologic data of mucosal melanomas diagnosed at Emergency City Hospital (Timisoara, Romania) during a period of 12 years. The study included 17 cases of extracutaneous, extraocular melanomas, with 16 primary melanomas and one secondary melanoma. All our patients were older than 53 years and were mostly men. Most of the patients presented with localized disease; only one case had regional lymph node metastases, and another one had systemic metastases at the time of diagnosis. Regarding localization, nine of 16 melanomas were in the head and neck region, six were diagnosed in the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts (three cases each), and one case had a rare localization (retroperitoneum). The most common histologic type was represented by epithelioid cells, and the majority of the tumors were achromic. Mucosal melanoma is a tumor associated with aging, all our patients being older than 53 years. Because of unspecific symptoms and low incidence, the diagnosis is often delayed and requires teamwork among the clinician, pathologist, radiologist, and oncologist.

However, in human diseases molecular mechanisms involved in proliferation and differentiation of HPCs are poorly understood. Methods and results In the present study activated HPCs and their microenvironment (niche) were investigated in acute and chronic human liver disease by gene-expression analysis and immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence. Cryopreserved liver tissues were used from patients with parenchymal versus biliary diseases: acute necrotising hepatitis (AH), cirrhosis after hepatitis C infection, and primary biliary cirrhosis in order to study differentiation of HPCs towards hepatocytic versus biliary lineage. Keratin 7 positive HPCs/reactive ductules were captured by means of laser capture microdissection and gene-expression profiles were obtained by using a customised PCR array. Gene expression results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence double staining. In all disease groups, microdissected HPCs expressed progenitor cell markers such as KRT 7, KRT 19, NCAM, ABCG 2, LIF, KIT, OCT 4, CD 44 and TERT. In AH, HPCs were most activated and showed a high expression of prominin- 1 (CD 133) and α-fetoprotein, and a strong activation of the Wnt pathway. In contrast to parenchymal diseases, HPCs in primary biliary cirrhosis (biliary differentiation) showed a high activation of Notch signalling. Conclusion A distinct pattern of HPC surface markers was found between acute and chronic liver diseases. Similar to what is known from animal experiments, strong evidence has been found signifying the role of Wnt signalling in proliferation of human HPCs whereas Notch signalling is involved in biliary differentiation.

Patients and methods: In this cross-sectional, noninterventional study, 198 patients with T 2 DM were enrolled according to a population-based, consecutive-case enrollment principle. In all patients, the adherence to DRSCA was evaluated using the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) questionnaire; a higher SDSCA score is associated with a better adherence. The presence and severity of neuropathy was assessed using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) and the severity of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ- 9). Results: The presence of neuropathy was associated with a decreased SDSCA score (26 points vs 37 points; P< 0. 001), an increased severe depression prevalence (24. 7 % vs 4. 3 %; P< 0. 001), and an increased PHQ- 9 score (12 points vs 7 points; P< 0. 001). The MNSI score was reverse correlated with SDSCA score (r=- 0. 527; P< 0. 001) and positively correlated with PHQ- 9 score (r= 0. 495; P< 0. 001). The reverse correlation between MNSI score and SDSCA score was present for all the subcomponents of SDSCA questionnaire (diet, exercise, glycemic monitoring, and foot care). Conclusion: The presence of neuropathy is associated with decreases in the quality of adherence to DRSCA in patients with T 2 DM and with increases in the symptomatology of depression. The significant, negative association between the severity of T 2 DM and the quality of disease self-management points to a possible loop-type relationship between these two components, being possible a reciprocal augmentation with negative consequences on the global management of the disease.

We previously have demonstrated that A&beta;P forms Ca 2 +-permeable pores on neuronal membranes, causes a marked increase in intracellular calcium level, and leads to neuronal death. Here, we investigated in detail the features of A&beta;P-induced changes in intracellular Ca 2 + level in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons using a multisite Ca 2 +- imaging system with fura- 2 as a fluorescent probe. Only {{a small fraction of}} short-term cultured hippocampal neurons (ca 1 week in vitro) exhibited changes in intracellular Ca 2 + level after A&beta;P exposure. However, A&beta;P caused an acute increase in intracellular Ca 2 + level in long-term cultured neurons (ca 1 month in vitro). The responses to A&beta;P were highly heterogeneous, and immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody to A&beta;P revealed that A&beta;P is deposited on some but not all neurons. Considering that the disruption of Ca 2 + homeostasis is the primary event in A&beta;P neurotoxicity, substances that protect neurons from an A&beta;P-induced intracellular Ca 2 + level increase may be candidates as therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. In line with the search for such protective substances, we found that the preadministration of neurosteroids including dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and pregnenolone significantly inhibits the increase in intracellular calcium level induced by A&beta;P. Our results suggest the possible significance of neurosteroids, whose levels are reduced in the elderly, in preventing A&beta;P neurotoxicity.

METHODS: Twenty-eight male Wistar rats were equally divided into 4 experimental groups and operated under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. (1) Sham: falsely-operated animals; (2) SS+IR: intestinal ischemia was accomplished by clipping the superior mesenteric artery during 60 minutes, with an administration of a standard volume of saline solution (SS) 5 min {{before the end of}} the ischemia period; the clip was then releases or a 120 -min period of reperfusion; (3) I+PTX+R: ischemia as above, PTX was administered (25 mg/kg) and the gut reperfused as above; (4) PTX+I+PTX+R: Five minutes before arterial occlusion PTX was administered; the superior mesenteric artery was then clipped for 60 minutes. After 55 -min ischemia, an additional dosis of PTX was administered; the clip was removed for reperfusion as above. At the 60 th min of reperfusion a third dosis of PTX was administered. RESULTS: PTX markedly attenuated lung injury as manifested by significant decreases (all P< 0. 001 as compared with the SS+IR group) of pulmonary wet/dry tissue weight ratio, total protein content, myeloperoxidase activity and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Moreover, it was apparent that in the group PTX+I+PTX+R the improvements have been even more significant. CONCLUSION: PTX exerted a protective effect on the lung from the injuries caused by intestinal ischemia/reperfusion. OBJETIVO: Avaliar os efeitos protetores da pentoxifilina (PTX) na lesão pulmonar observada após isquemia (I) seguida de reperfusão (R) intestinal. MÉTODOS: Vinte e oito ratos machos foram divididos aleatoriamente em quatro grupos experimentais e operados sobre anestesia quetamina-xilazina. (1) Sham: animais falsamente operados; (2) SS+IR: isquemia intestinal realizada pelo clampeamento da artéria mesentérica superior durante 60 minutos, com a administração de solução salina (SS) 5 minutos antes do período de isquemia, após a retirada do clamp houve a reperfusão por mais 120 minutos; (3) I+PTX+R: isquemia como mencionado anteriormente seguida da administração de PTX (25 mg/Kg) 5 minutos antes do final da isquemia (60 minutos) seguida de reperfusão por mais 120 minutos; (4) PTX+I+PTX+R: 5 minutos antes da isquemia foi administrado PTX, após 55 minutos de isquemia foi administrado outra dose de PTX e a reperfusão mantida por mais 120 minutos, sendo que aos 60 minutos da reperfusão outra dose de PTX foi administrada. RESULTADOS: A pentoxifilina reduziu os marcadores de lesão pulmonar (proteínas totais, malondialdeído, atividade da mieloperoxidase e fator de necrose tumoral) quando comparada com o grupo não tratado (P< 0. 001), contudo esta redução foi mais significante no grupo PTX+I+PTX+R. CONCLUSÃO: A pentoxifilina exerce efeito protetor no pulmão no trauma causado por isquemia/reperfusão intestinal.

As type 2 diabetes mellitus is predominantly more prevalent in aging populations, this creates a major public health burden. Older adults with diabetes have the highest rates of major lower-extremity amputation, myocardial infarction, visual impairment, and end-stage renal disease of any age group. The aims of our study were to assess whether age is an independent factor for the occurrence of diabetic neuropathy (DN), and to evaluate the relationship between the presence and the severity of DN and the diabetes duration and blood glucose level. In this study, we enrolled 198 patients, previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. For all patients, we measured hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c), lipid profile, and body mass index and we assessed the presence and severity of DN using the evaluation of clinical signs and symptoms. Patients had a median age of 62 years, with a median of diabetes duration of 7 years; 55. 1 % of the patients were men and the average HbA 1 c in the cohort was 8. 2 %. The prevalence of DN according to Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument was 28. 8 %, being significantly and positively correlated with higher age (65 vs 59 years; P= 0. 001) and HbA 1 c (8. 6 % vs 8. 0 %; P= 0. 027). No significant correlations were observed between the severity of DN and diabetes duration, body mass index (31. 9 vs 29. 9 kg/m 2), or the number of centimeters exceeding the normal waist circumference (25. 2 vs 17. 3 cm; P= 0. 003). In conclusion, age influences the presence of DN, independent on other risk factors. This influence persists even after adjusting for other, very important risk factors, like blood glucose level or diabetes duration.

40|$|Introdution: The {{morphological}} characteristics {{obtained by}} craniometry {{may be the}} key to sex determination and enable us to identify unknown individuals in anywhere in the world. Aims: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of the linear morphometry of foramen magnum to verify the morphological characteristics for gender determination in human skulls of Brazilian individuals. Methods: With a digital caliper, were made three non-consecutive measurements of the foramen magnum in 215 human skulls (139 male and 76 female), from the collection of the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Morphology</b> and Descriptive Topography - UNIFESP/SP with registered data on nationality, gender, and age. The craniometric measurements were made in accordance with the protocol defined by Günay and Altinkök (2000). The data were submitted to intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Student t-test with significance level of 5 %. Results: There were no statistically significant differences (chi-square, p > 0. 05) between the ethnic groups within each gender. The ANOVA and Tukey tests showed that the gender influenced the width of the foramen magnum. The FM is higher in males (30. 3 ± 0. 20) than in females (29. 4 ± 0. 23), but not in length (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: The morphometric linear method of the foramen magnum (width) was able to determine the morphological differences between sexes and can be used in conjunction with other anthropological techniques to gender determination of unknown individuals...|$|E

Analysis of the responses revealed the participation of teaching assistants in a large percentage of classes and the use of teaching resources, particularly images, from conventional radiographs to magnetic resonance images. The number of classes for cadaver dissection and the number of students with access to that type of class were small. In most cases, dissection was performed according to anatomic regions or systems. Medicine and nursing students had the highest number of practical dissection classes. Most students were assessed using practical and theoretical tests. Findings revealed conditions similar to those found elsewhere. Resources should be renewed and used to improve teaching for students whose courses demand the study of human anatomy.

For this reason a longitudinal study goes beyond the objectives of our previous work, even though it repre-sents an interesting suggestion for future research. How-ever, a longitudinal study on personality and sexuality of infertile couples compared to fertile controls raises some issues. Firstly, since psycho-sexual counselling helps the partner’s wishes, the level of sexual communication be-tween the partners, their cultural role and personal pref-erences [6]. Better, other aspects of the sexual interaction (e. g., expressions of affection, the nature of the sexual activities, the effectiveness of stimulation) are more pre-dictive of sexual satisfaction than the duration of the sexual encounter [7].
