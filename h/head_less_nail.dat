50|$|Green lumber {{presents}} its own {{characteristics as}} well. Some species of wood are better assembled green because wood splits <b>less</b> when <b>nailed</b> green.

5000|$|Water in the vadose zone has a {{pressure}} <b>head</b> <b>less</b> than atmospheric pressure, and is retained {{by a combination}} of adhesion (funiculary groundwater), and capillary action (capillary groundwater). If the vadose zone envelops soil, the water contained therein is termed soil moisture. In fine grained soils, capillary action can cause the pores of the soil to be fully saturated above the water table at {{a pressure}} less than atmospheric. The vadose zone does not include the area that is still saturated above the water table, {{often referred to as the}} capillary fringe.|$|R

50|$|Some governments {{around the}} world set {{standards}} for water usage and regulate shower heads. For example, in the United States, residential and most commercial shower heads must flow no more than 9.5 liters per minute (2.5 gallons per minute) per the Department of Energy ruling 10 CFR 430. Low-flow shower <b>heads,</b> <b>less</b> than or equal 7.6 liters per minute (2.0 gallons per minute), can use water more efficiently by aerating the water stream, altering nozzles through advanced flow principles or by high-speed oscillation of the spray stream. USEPA administers a voluntary water saving program, WaterSense, which can certify low-flow shower heads.|$|R

Scarcely had the dust settled when the sun caught the light of fifty thousand bayonets, and a hundred shells were shrieking across the crater's edge. Earth to earth, alas, and dust to dust! Men who ran across that rim of a summer's after-noon died in torture under tier upon tier of their comrades,--and so the hole was filled.|$|R

40|$|A reliable, {{cheap and}} simple {{pyrotechnic}} match head {{has been developed}} utilising a pyrotechnic slurry {{at the end of}} an optical fibre. A 1 W pulsed diode laser has been used to ignite the match head at pulse energies of about 2 mJ. The laser matchhead is a convenient means for ignition of pyrotechnic devices less prone to unintentional ignition from electromagnetic fields, radio frequency absorption, electromagnetic pulses, electrical discharge or stray electrical energy than conventional bridgewire match heads connected to electrical cables. The laser match head can also be coated with layers of different pyrotechnic slurry in order to make the match <b>head</b> <b>less</b> friction and impact sensitive, and to give the match head different thermal ignition properties...|$|R
