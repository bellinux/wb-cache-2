25|$|To {{calculate}} the bands including electron-electron interaction many-body effects, one can resort to so-called Green's function methods. Indeed, {{knowledge of the}} Green's function of a system provides both ground (the total energy) and also excited state observables of the system. The poles of the Green's function are the quasiparticle energies, the bands of a solid. The Green's function can be calculated by solving the Dyson equation once the self-energy {{of the system is}} known. For real systems like solids, the self-energy <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>complex</b> quantity and usually approximations are needed to solve the problem. One such approximation is the GW approximation, so called from the mathematical form the self-energy takes as the product Σ = GW of the Green's function G and the dynamically screened interaction W. This approach is more pertinent when addressing the calculation of band plots (and also quantities beyond, such as the spectral function) and can also be formulated in a completely ab initio way. The GW approximation seems to provide band gaps of insulators and semiconductors in agreement with experiment, and hence to correct the systematic DFT underestimation.|$|E

Continuous distillation is used widely in the chemical process industries where large quantities of liquids have to be distilled.

500|$|Espinosa {{landed the}} lead role of the film Gloria in 2014. The film is a biopic about singer-songwriter Gloria Trevi, and her {{relation}} with her manager, record producer Sergio Andrade. The movie chronicles {{the rise and fall}} of the singer's career, detailing Trevi's first encounter with Andrade (who became her mentor), her brief tenure in a band, her rise to musical stardom, a sex scandal involving minors, and her imprisonment in Brazil. Espinosa won the role after a month-and-a-half casting process, stating that [...] "I do not know how many actresses were , or who they were, but once I got the role I knew it was a big responsibility, because it is a character who is alive and has a lot of fans, I had to do it well. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>complex</b> character, full of nuances, with great force". Espinosa took singing lessons and had to learn Trevi's accent. Also, to fully prepare for the role, the actress was assigned a choreographer and worked with the film director to find the right tone for the scenes.

2500|$|Polymerization {{is likely}} to take place through either ionic and/or radical {{processes}} which are initiated by plasma formed from the glow discharge. The classic view presented by Yasuda [...] based upon thermal initiation of parylene polymerization [...] is that there are many propagating species present at any given time as shown in Figure 3. This figure shows two different pathways by which the polymerization may take place. The first pathway is a monofunctionalization process, bears resemblance to a standard free radical polymerization mechanism (M•)- although with the caveat that the reactive species may be ionic and not necessarily radical. The second pathway refers to a difunctional mechanism, which by example may contain a cationic and a radical propagating center on the same monomer (•M•). A consequence is that 'polymer' can grow in multiple directions by multiple pathways off one species, such as a surface or other monomer. This possibility let Yasuda to term the mechanism as a very rapid step-growth polymerization. In the diagram, Mx refers to the original monomer molecule or any of many dissociation products such as chlorine, fluorine and hydrogen. The M• species refers to those that are activated and capable of participating in reactions to form new covalent bonds. The •M• species refers to an activated difunctional monomer species. The subscripts i, j, and k show the sizes of the different species involved. Even though radicals represent the activated species, any ion or radical could be used in the polymerization. As can be seen here, plasma polymerization <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>complex</b> process, with many parameters effecting everything from rate to chain length.|$|E
