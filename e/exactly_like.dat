5|$|In the {{parallel}} universe, Walternate's (Noble) position as national security czar makes Peter's disappearance a major news story. Walternate {{falls into a}} deep depression, unable to explain how his child has been kidnapped by someone that looked <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> him. Elizabeth coaxes {{him out of his}} depression and he returns to Bishop Dynamic in Florida to continue his job.|$|E
5|$|It {{became a}} game, with Feiffer {{trying to draw}} things the way he wanted, and Juster trying to {{describe}} things that were impossible to sketch. These included the Triple Demons of Compromise—one short and fat, one tall and thin, and the third <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> the first two. Feiffer got his revenge by depicting the author as the Whether Man, clad in a toga.|$|E
5|$|P.T. {{centers on}} an unnamed protagonist who awakens in a concrete-lined room, and opens {{a door to}} a haunted corridor, in which he can only walk through a hallway which {{continuously}} loops and redecorates itself. The first time he passes, a radio reports on a familicide, which was committed by the father, and later mentions two other cases <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> it.|$|E
60|$|But little Miss Julia, {{though she}} had not <b>exactly</b> <b>liked</b> the nature of Mr. Thorne's attention, was {{accustomed}} to be played with by gentlemen, and did not relish {{the idea of being}} sent so soon to her aunt.|$|R
60|$|Felix went back, {{flushed with}} gratification, and yet, {{to a certain}} degree, with confusion, and not <b>exactly</b> <b>liking</b> the {{prospect}} of being interrogated as to what the Bishop had said to him: indeed, he never told the whole of it to any one but Cherry. Somehow, though Wilmet was his counsellor and mainstay, Geraldine was the sharer of all those confidences that came spontaneously out of the full but reserved heart.|$|R

5|$|The {{action of}} this {{principle}} is <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> {{that of the}} centrifugal governor of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it would make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow.|$|E
5|$|André faced Hogan for {{the title}} on the February 5, 1988 {{broadcast}} of The Main Event, with Dave Hebner as the scheduled referee. André pinned Hogan to win the championship and handed the belt to DiBiase. The pinfall was controversial, however, as Hogan's shoulders {{were not on the}} mat when the referee made the three count. After the match, the real Dave Hebner, who looked identical to referee that had officiated the match, ran to the ring to attack the impostor referee. Hulk Hogan then threw the impostor out of the ring onto DiBiase and his bodyguard Virgil. According to the storyline, DiBiase had paid an unnamed referee to get plastic surgery to look <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> Dave Hebner. In reality, the second referee was Dave's twin brother Earl Hebner, who was making his on-screen debut with the WWF.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2009 after South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone {{approached}} Obsidian {{about making a}} role-playing game designed to look <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> the television series. Parker and Stone were involved throughout the game's production: they wrote its script, consulted on the design, and as in the television program they voiced many of the characters. The Stick of Truths production was turbulent; following the bankruptcy of the original publisher, THQ, {{the rights to the}} game were acquired by Ubisoft in early 2013, and its release date was postponed several times from its initial date in March 2013 to its eventual release in March 2014, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.|$|E

But, with all his oddities, he is a quiet kind of a person, and has such a way of taking hold of one's mind, that, without <b>exactly</b> <b>liking</b> him (for I don't know enough of the young man), I should be sorry {{to lose sight of}} him entirely. A woman clings to slight acquaintances when she lives so much alone as I do." ...|$|R

5|$|Lucas {{revisited}} {{the scene}} in the 1997 Special Edition release of A New Hope, restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with Huttese, a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to make it look as if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford and that the crew had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete. The scene was polished further for the 2004 release on DVD, improving Jabba's appearance with advancements in CGI techniques, although neither release looks <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> the original Jabba the Hutt puppet.|$|E
5|$|They were unpopular with sportsmen as {{the dark}} colours of the breed {{did not show}} up in hunting conditions, and the {{elongated}} and short shape of the early breed was not very practical for moving easily through cover. The low-slung variety of Field Spaniel were developed by Phineas Bullock from dogs previously owned by Sir Francis Burdett, the secretary of the Birmingham Dog Show. Burdett was said to have owned a variety of black Cocker Spaniels. Bullock crossed the Field Spaniel with the Sussex Spaniel and the English Water Spaniel. In the 1870s he was very successful in the show ring with his variety of Field Spaniel; however, it resulted in a dog that was almost <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> a Sussex Spaniel {{with the exception of the}} head itself.|$|E
5|$|We were {{supposed}} to be with her in the studio for a couple of days. She kindly invited us to stay a little longer. We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, coming out of her head really sounding <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, {{that white}} lights, such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{decide to}} split up and {{interrogate}} the doppelgangers. Betty tells Mulder that Lulu is causing {{all of the problems}} and forcing her to leave, while Lulu tells Scully the same thing. Later, the two look-alikes pass each other and a sewer grate blows open, sucking Mulder into the storm drain and sealing him in. Scully finds that the girls share the same father, a {{man by the name of}} Bob Damphouse, who is in prison. Damphouse is revealed to be mentally insane, and is always in a fit of rage. Eventually, Mulder finds his way out of the storm drain. At the prison, Scully meets a man that looks <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> Bert Zupanic. Lulu and Betty meet at a stadium and everyone in the audience breaks into a fight. The other Bert Zupanic shows up and everyone stops fighting. The two Zupanics see each other and a fight breaks out again. The episode ends with Mulder and Scully shown bruised and beaten.|$|E

From then many saints, holy travelers, as well as religious people went there to worship the place.|$|R
