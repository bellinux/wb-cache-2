5|$|Auf der Maur is the eponymous debut studio album by the Canadian {{alternative}} rock musician Melissa Auf der Maur, {{released on}} February 2, 2004 on Capitol Records. Following {{her career as}} a bassist for <b>Hole</b> <b>and</b> The Smashing Pumpkins, Auf der Maur recorded the album of the course of two years in various studios through the United States and Canada with producer Chris Goss. The songs featured on Auf der Maur were written over a ten-year period, from 1992 to 2002, throughout her time in Tinker, <b>Hole</b> <b>and</b> The Smashing Pumpkins.|$|E

5|$|All birds lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. <b>Hole</b> <b>and</b> burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs. There are many {{exceptions}} to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun {{with a bag of}} powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent <b>hole,</b> <b>and</b> fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E

5|$|From {{the end of}} the Mesozoic to present, {{the region}} went through a series of uplifts and erosional sequences. Commencing 66million years ago the Laramide orogeny was a period of mountain-building and erosion in western North America that created the ancestral Rocky Mountains. This cycle of uplift and erosion left behind one of the most {{complete}} non-marine Cenozoic rock sequences found in North America. Conglomerate rocks composed of quartzite and interspersed with mudstone and sandstones were deposited during erosion from a now vanished mountain range that existed to the northwest of the current Teton Range. These deposits also have trace quantities of gold and mercury. During the Eocene and Oligocene, volcanic eruptions from the ancestral Absaroka Range buried the region under various volcanic deposits. Sedimentary basins developed in the region due to drop faulting, creating an ancestral Jackson <b>Hole</b> <b>and</b> by the Pliocene (10million years ago), an ancestral Jackson Lake known as Teewinot Lake. During the Quaternary, landslides, erosion and glacial activity deposited soils and rock debris throughout the Snake River valley of Jackson <b>Hole</b> <b>and</b> left behind terminal moraines which impound the current lakes. The most recent example of rapid alteration to the landscape occurred in 1925 just east of the park, when the Gros Ventre landslide was triggered by spring melt from a heavy snowpack as well as heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|In Gilroy and Hollister, sixteen {{people were}} injured, and damage totaled $500,000. Chimneys fell (especially on older {{homes in the}} {{downtown}} area of Gilroy) and glass was broken, but in Gilroy structural damage afflicted five buildings. A wall was cracked at city hall, and a court room ceiling collapsed. Damaged structural components at a Ford's Department Store forced its closure. In Hollister, a J. C. Penney had a <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> cracks in its ceiling and a parapet collapsed at a law office. At Casa de Fruta, a service station sustained structural damage, as did a fire station at Pacheco Pass.|$|E

5|$|The cycle repeats at a {{frequency}} relative to {{how long it}} takes a wave to travel to the first open <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> back twice (i.e. four times the length of the pipe). For example: when all the holes bar the very top one are open (i.e. the trill 'B' key is pressed), the note A4 (440 Hz) is produced. This represents a repeat of the cycle 440 times per second.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} crew {{took control}} of the site by erecting scaffolding on 6 December 2006, and demolition commenced on 12 December. Workers took down the clock mechanism and clock face, leaving a gaping <b>hole,</b> <b>and</b> then proceeded to lift the clock tower off in one piece. After the protesters had been dispersed, the remainder of the pier was completely dismantled, away from the glare of publicity.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect is}} very small but {{measurable}} on Earth using the Mössbauer effect and was first observed in the Pound–Rebka experiment. However, it is significant near a black <b>hole,</b> <b>and</b> as an object approaches the event horizon the red shift becomes infinite. It is also the dominant cause of large angular-scale temperature fluctuations in {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (see Sachs-Wolfe effect).|$|E

30|$|In {{the public}} {{femtocell}} network, {{due to the}} lack of precise planning, there will be inevitably some coverage <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> multi-femtocell overlap area, resulting in some UEs' low received signal power or heavy interference. We plan to solve this problem through coordinated multipoint transmission technique of multiple femtocells, which in general is to make the high-gain main lobes of the femtocells toward the coverage <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> low-gain side lobes toward the overlap areas. Through collaboration of femtocells the coverage <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> interference between each other can be reduced and thus improving the network performance.|$|R

5|$|The {{work was}} continued, first by E. J. Mason from 1946 to 1949, {{and then by}} G. R. Morgan in 1972. Later work led by Edgar Kingsley Tratman {{explored}} the human occupation of the Rhinoceros <b>hole,</b> <b>and</b> showed that the fourth chamber of the great cave was a Romano-British cemetery. During excavations in 1954–1957 at Hole Ground, just outside {{the entrance to the}} cave, the foundations of a 1st-century hut and Iron Age pottery were seen. These were covered by the foundations of Roman buildings, dating from the 1st to the late 4th century.|$|E
5|$|These are of {{particular}} interest {{because they are the}} first black holes discovered that were intermediate in mass between the conventional stellar-mass black <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> the supermassive black holes discovered at the cores of galaxies. The mass of these intermediate mass black holes is proportional to the mass of the clusters, following a pattern previously discovered between supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a billion}} years of a galaxy's formation, key {{structures}} begin to appear. Globular clusters, the central supermassive black <b>hole,</b> <b>and</b> a galactic bulge of metal-poor Population II stars form. The creation of a supermassive black hole appears to {{play a key role}} in actively regulating the growth of galaxies by limiting the total amount of additional matter added. During this early epoch, galaxies undergo a major burst of star formation.|$|E

5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} Howard {{how he could}} have made that $1000 raise, to which Howard replied that poker was all about making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 pot {{with a pair of}} 10s shows while Howard had just a Queen high. By raising $1000, Howard was possibly representing a Queen in the <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> trying to buy the pot at the point. The Kid only had to put in another $1000 into a $4000, so he was offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since he only had to be right 1 in 5 times to break even. Howard seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise as well as the $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of No Doubt's {{breakthrough}} album Tragic Kingdom (1995), the band wrote more than 20 songs for a new album, influenced by artists such as The Cure. Having toured extensively {{for two and a}} half years since the release of Tragic Kingdom, they initially had trouble producing material and decided to experiment with new sounds. Many of the songs were written in a rented house in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, where bassist Tony Kanal was living. During early production in mid-1998 the band worked on seven tracks in Los Angeles with Matthew Wilder, who had produced Tragic Kingdom, but had creative differences with him. They planned on going to New York City to work with producer Michael Beinhorn, who had produced for alternative rock acts such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, <b>Hole,</b> <b>and</b> Soundgarden.|$|E
5|$|During that period, general {{relativity}} remained {{something of a}} curiosity among physical theories. It was clearly superior to Newtonian gravity, being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory. Einstein himself had shown in 1915 how his theory explained the anomalous perihelion advance of the planet Mercury without any arbitrary parameters (""). Similarly, a 1919 expedition led by Eddington confirmed {{general relativity}}'s prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, making Einstein instantly famous. Yet the theory entered the mainstream of theoretical physics and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, {{now known as the}} golden age of general relativity. Physicists began to understand the concept of a black <b>hole,</b> <b>and</b> to identify quasars as one of these objects' astrophysical manifestations. Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power, and relativistic cosmology, too, became amenable to direct observational tests.|$|E
