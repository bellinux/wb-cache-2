5|$|The god Bragi asks where a thundering {{sound is}} coming from, {{and says that}} the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had {{returned}} to Valhalla—and that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> the movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.|$|E
5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E

25|$|While the {{possibility}} that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits {{is not a new}} notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently. The study was conducted with a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper. Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, nor did she have any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard intelligence test, and her working memory was evaluated and found to be normal. However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years. Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> noise and evokes a stressful response.|$|E
25|$|The Barranca Arroyo {{is a small}} canyon {{structure}} {{about an}} hour and a half from the municipal seat. The water flows year round with several areas where it pools, but the water is cold. The area is surrounded by large mountains with abundant vegetation. There is camping, hiking and picnicking. The Peña de la Viuda is a natural monolith which falls directly into an arroyo. The area has abundant vegetation, and activities such as skiing, camping and hiking. La Escondida is an area in mountainous forest with a permanent fresh water spring. It permits camping and hiking. El Cidral is an area with cedar trees surrounding a clearing for camping and hiking. The Peña de la Glora waterfall is surrounded by thick vegetation. The lowest part has a natural spring and the upper part has a deep, unexplored cave. The Cueva de los Riscos (Cave of the Crags) is named after the crags which appear in various of its chambers. The entrance begins with a rocky descent then levels out to an area with sand. The center has a hillock with looks like a monolith rock. This can be climbed to observe the various crags with contain ice. One of these in the shape of a pulpit and another is called the “bell tower” because if it is struck <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a bell.|$|E
500|$|... "Nature Boy" [...] is so otherworldly in its {{melody and}} lyric that {{any number of}} interpretations over the decades, from Nat Cole's to Alex Chilton's, {{have never been able}} to make it ordinary. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> {{something}} that, from the minute it was written, existed out of time and place—all thousand and one Arabian Nights compressed into two and a half minutes as mediated by a cracked Mojave Debussy slugging down the last of the absinthe from his canteen.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} of the album for The Harvard Crimson, Thomas M. Levenson wrote, [...] "Hubbard's music does not, as a result, offend the listener. It's not execrable. It is just {{extraordinarily}} dull. As a pianist/composer, Hubbard sounds like Bruckner rewritten for the dentist's office." [...] Don Lewis reviewed the album for The Milwaukee Journal, and commented, [...] "It's peaceful, attractive music, even though, after a while, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> many of Miss Hubbard's compositions are swatches from the same bolt of cloth." ...|$|E
500|$|Gallagher {{has also}} been very vocal about knife crime. In 2008 he was quoted: [...] "The scumbags are taking over the streets. I don't know what David Cameron and Gordon Brown {{are going to do}} about it. It all goes back to the Thatcher years. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a cliché but that's when the rot set in." [...] When the {{interviewer}} suggested it was for status he replied, [...] "In my day status was about trying to be somebody, not trying to kill somebody, so how's that all changed?" ...|$|E
500|$|Ibn Ali had further studio sessions, with Pope, Art Davis {{and drummer}} Khalil Madi, on August 23 and September 7, 1965. However, the master tapes of the {{unreleased}} recordings {{were said to}} have been destroyed in a fire at the record label's warehouse in 1976. The Library of Congress has a 1964 recording of an Ibn Ali solo improvisation, recorded at Roach's home. John Murph in JazzTimes described it in 2014 as [...] "Thoroughly modern with a whimsical rhythmic undertow and wayward melodic passages, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a new Jason Moran composition." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with NME magazine, frontman Alex Turner cited John Lennon {{as a major}} influence lyrically. When speaking about Lennon, Turner said; [...] "I remember when I first started writing songs, and writing lyrics, I {{really wanted to be}} able to write an [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] type song, and I found it very difficult. You listen to that and <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> it's all nonsense, but it's difficult to write that sort of thing and make it compelling. Lennon definitely had a knack for that".|$|E
500|$|When {{introducing}} the composition to Lennon, McCartney {{assured him that}} he would [...] "fix" [...] the line [...] "the movement you need is on your shoulder", reasoning that [...] "it's a stupid expression; <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a parrot." [...] Lennon replied: [...] "You won't, you know. That's the best line in the song." [...] McCartney retained the phrase; he later said of his subsequent live performances of the song: [...] "that's the line when I think of John, and sometimes I get a little emotional during that moment." ...|$|E
500|$|The double album has a disc of rock {{songs and}} another with {{acoustic}} ones, which Grohl said demonstrated his artistic freedom – [...] "It's not one specific genre of music, it's not one specific style. I'm just a musician. I can play {{all these different}} instruments, I can write a bossa nova, I can write a thrash tune." [...] He also stated {{that he tried to}} fit the Foo Fighters sound even with stylistic differences: [...] "It's still the same four guys playing it so it just is a Foo Fighters song, whether <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> Carcass or fucking Ry Cooder." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Slant Magazines Eric Henderson, The Beatles is {{a rarity}} among the band's {{recorded}} works, {{in that it}} [...] "resists reflexive canonisation, which, along with society's continued fragmentation, keeps the album fresh and surprising". In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that because of its wide variety of musical styles, the album can be [...] "a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view". He concludes: [...] "None of <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> {{it was meant to}} share album space together, but somehow The Beatles creates its own style and sound through its mess."

500|$|Furtado has {{characterized}} [...] "Maneater" [...] as [...] "a 'couture pop' song", explaining {{that it is}} [...] "in your face and very fashionable, stylistic and of-the-moment." [...] In an interview with MTV News, she compared it favorably to eating too much cheesecake: [...] "It's got a crazy loud beat, and the vocals are bitchy and loud. A {{lot of people say}} <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> Peaches, because of the delivery, the spooky vocals." [...] According to Furtado, the song is related to how people become [...] "hot on themselves" [...] when dancing in their underwear in front of a mirror. [...] " [...] truly has a life of its own; it makes you move", she said.|$|E
500|$|A {{critic of}} the Beatles' output {{immediately}} post-Sgt. Pepper, Ian MacDonald found [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] "as unfocused and monotonous {{as most of the}} group's output of this period", adding that the song [...] "numbingly fails to transcend the weary boredom that inspired it". Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, Greg Kot considered it to be [...] "one of [...] least-memorable Beatles tracks … a song essentially about boredom – and <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> it". Similarly unimpressed with Magical Mystery Tour, Tim Riley describes [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] as a song that [...] "goes nowhere tiresomely", with a vocal that [...] "sounds as tired and droning" [...] as the musical accompaniment.|$|E

500|$|After the game's release, a {{reviewer}} for Game Revolution praised its sound, {{saying that}} [...] "When you're {{in a crowded}} city, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a crowded city. Walk past a bar, and you'll hear {{the noise of the}} drunken patrons inside. Wander near a slave auction, and you'll hear the auctioneer calling. Go to a party in the festival hall, and it sounds just like a party". The same reviewer also stated [...] "Planescape has just about the best sound I've ever heard in a game." [...] IGN gave the sound 8.5 out of 10 and noted that [...] "The game has fantastic speech and sound effects, but what's more impressive is the way they fade in and out depending on how close you're standing to them." ...|$|E
500|$|Like many {{contemporary}} alternative bands, the Smashing Pumpkins utilized shifts in song dynamics, going from quiet to loud and vice versa. Hüsker Dü's seminal album Zen Arcade demonstrated {{to the band}} how they could place gentler material against more aggressive fare, and Corgan made such shifts in dynamics central {{to the pursuit of}} his grand musical ambitions. Corgan said he liked the idea of creating his own alternative universe through sound that essentially tells the listener, [...] "Welcome to Pumpkin Land, this is what <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> on Planet Pumpkin." [...] This emphasis on atmosphere carried through to Adore (described as [...] "arcane night music" [...] in prerelease promotion) and the Machina albums (concept records that tell the story of a fictional rock band).|$|E
500|$|The J Man of Crosswalk.com gave Almost There a B, {{and said}} that [...] "In the ever–growing genre of modern worship, MercyMe {{steps up to the}} plate and drives a home run over the fence". He praised the album as having a [...] "fresh sound", but {{described}} much of the album was [...] "somewhat low–key". Kevin Chamberlain of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. Chamberlain praised the album as being [...] "lyrically one of the best albums out there" [...] {{and said that}} [...] "Every song is based on some sort of Scripture or Spiritual truth seldom found in some Christian music". However, Chamberlain felt the album's sound was average, saying <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "FFH or any typical Contemporary Christian artist".|$|E
