5|$|The largest {{win in the}} Virginia Lottery's {{history to}} date {{occurred}} on February 20, 2004, when retired truck driver J. R. Triplett of Winchester won a Mega Millions jackpot worth $239 million. Nine Mega Millions <b>jackpots</b> and one Powerball jackpot have been won in Virginia so far.|$|E
5|$|The odds of {{matching}} all six numbers {{to win the}} Mega Millions jackpot are 1 in 258,890,850. The odds of winning any prize are 1 in 14.7. As of September 2017, nine Mega Millions <b>jackpots</b> have been won in Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Wheel {{has also}} been {{licensed}} to International Game Technology for use in its slot machines. The games are all loosely based on the show, with contestants {{given the chance to}} spin the wheel to win a jackpot prize. Since 1996, over 200 slot games based on the show have been created, both for real-world casinos and those on the Internet. With over 1,000 wins awarded in excess of $1,000,000 and over $3 billion in <b>jackpots</b> delivered, Wheel has been regarded as the most successful slots brand of all time.|$|E
50|$|The Super <b>Jackpot</b> {{could be}} played for {{in one of}} three ways. Initially, if the Expert solved a <b>Jackpot</b> Riddle and last three digits of the <b>Jackpot</b> matched the Target Number, the players (whoever asked the <b>Jackpot</b> Riddle and whoever {{answered}} it) split the Super <b>Jackpot.</b> Later, the Expert had to answer a second riddle asked by Edwards after solving a <b>Jackpot</b> Riddle when the last three digits of the <b>Jackpot</b> matched the Target Number in order to share the Super <b>Jackpot</b> with the other player. The Super <b>Jackpot</b> could also be won if the Expert chose the player that had the Super <b>Jackpot</b> Wildcard and correctly answered the Super <b>Jackpot</b> Riddle, again asked by Edwards.|$|R
5000|$|After {{winning the}} <b>Jackpot</b> with a <b>Jackpot</b> Pool Cap, the <b>Jackpot</b> Pool Cap grows by €5,000,000. (In other words, after the capped <b>Jackpot</b> of €185,000,000 is won, the next <b>Jackpot</b> Pool Cap is €190,000,000, {{then the next}} time €195,000,000 etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} the <b>jackpot</b> {{increases}} by a small amount for every play on any connected machine. The amount by which the <b>jackpot</b> advances is set by the casino ("the house"). A machine offering a progressive <b>jackpot</b> usually displays the {{amount of the}} <b>jackpot,</b> rather boldly, to attract players. After a player wins the <b>jackpot,</b> the <b>jackpot</b> resets to a preset minimum level.|$|R
25|$|Division 1 {{no longer}} <b>jackpots.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Strike Four jackpot {{starts at}} $100,000 and {{increases}} with each draw, depending on sales. Due {{to the relative}} unpopularity of Lotto Strike, <b>jackpots</b> occur often and it can often take many months for a Strike Four prize to be won. The Strike Four prize is capped at $2 million, with any further <b>jackpots</b> being added to the next Strike Four pool after it is next won.|$|E
25|$|A Guaranteed Millionaire {{was drawn}} every week from the First Division winners (see below). This meant that <b>Jackpots</b> and Superdraws {{were out of}} the {{question}} for 21 months.|$|E
50|$|A {{progressive}} <b>jackpot</b> is a <b>jackpot</b> (a gambling {{grand prize}} or payout) which increases {{each time the}} game is played but the <b>jackpot</b> is not won. When the progressive <b>jackpot</b> is won, the <b>jackpot</b> for the next play is reset to a predetermined value, and resumes increasing under the same rule.|$|R
50|$|The {{value of}} the riddle {{increased}} the {{value of the}} <b>Jackpot.</b> If the King selected the contestant holding the <b>Jackpot</b> Riddle (one per game) and answered it correctly, those two contestants split the <b>Jackpot.</b> Depending on the rules or the situation, the King could ask the <b>Jackpot</b> Riddle-holder to be seated and continue the game, perhaps with other bonuses, a larger <b>Jackpot,</b> or the Super <b>Jackpot</b> in mind.|$|R
5000|$|When the <b>Jackpot</b> Question was found, the Expert {{could either}} {{try to answer}} it or go for the Super <b>Jackpot</b> by {{answering}} all remaining questions in the game, including the <b>Jackpot</b> Question. If the player missed any of the remaining questions, the <b>Jackpot</b> was reset to $0 and a new Super <b>Jackpot</b> was established.|$|R
25|$|There was the {{provision}} for a jackpot for the 2 Number prize, which could jackpot {{for five weeks}} before being rolled down into the 1 Number dividend. However <b>jackpots</b> very rarely occurred.|$|E
25|$|The Pools {{offers the}} same five {{divisions}} as Saturday Lotto; {{the odds of}} winning Division One with a single game are 1 in 2,760,681. The Pools usually has a minimum first division prize of $60,000, but <b>jackpots</b> often.|$|E
25|$|Matching more numbers, the payout goes up. Although none {{of these}} {{additional}} prizes affect the chances of winning the jackpot, they do improve the odds of winning something and therefore add {{a little to the}} value of the ticket. On the other hand, multiple smaller prizes usually mean smaller <b>jackpots.</b> It is common for the jackpot to be split evenly if multiple players have tickets with all the winning numbers.|$|E
50|$|The largest Lotto 6/49 <b>jackpot,</b> and {{the largest}} single <b>jackpot</b> in Canadian lottery history, was drawn on October 17, 2015 for a <b>jackpot</b> of $64 million. The <b>jackpot</b> was won by one ticket {{purchased}} in Mississauga, Ontario.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>jackpot</b> {{ticket number}} is then drawn, {{separately}} from the main draw.A <b>jackpot</b> ticket can only {{be one of the}} previous tickets drawn which means you must be drawn twice to actually win a <b>jackpot</b> prize If the ticket number drawn matches a winning number exactly (one-offs do not count), then they win the jackpot; otherwise, that number wins 10 free tickets for an advance draw and the <b>jackpot</b> increments by a certain amount. In recent years the $2 <b>Jackpot</b> – which is statistically more difficult to win than the [...] "6-from-45" [...] Tattslotto-style games – has reached more than $10 million more than once through continued <b>jackpotting.</b> The highest <b>jackpot</b> win to date in the $2 <b>Jackpot</b> Lottery is $16,320,000, won on 6 October 2009. The highest <b>jackpot</b> win to date in the $5 <b>Jackpot</b> Lottery is $38.185 million won on 22 November 2011.|$|R
50|$|When the Powerball <b>jackpot</b> is won, {{the next}} <b>jackpot</b> is {{guaranteed}} to be $40 million (annuity). If a <b>jackpot</b> is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the <b>jackpot</b> pool {{is guaranteed to}} be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the <b>jackpot</b> pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the <b>jackpot</b> is won in consecutive drawings.|$|R
25|$|Later that summer, a {{well known}} gambler from the Skeena River was aboard, {{and he spoke}} to Captain Bucey about the {{possibility}} of having a poker game on one of the lower decks. The gambler promised it would not only occupy the players, but some spectators as well. Bucey was agreeable to the idea and gave his consent. Although gambling on sternwheelers that held liquor licenses was illegal, it was also a long and much-loved tradition. The game started off modestly enough, but soon huge sums were being wagered, and some large <b>jackpots</b> were being won. Present {{since the start of the}} game was a stranger, who was a provincial policeman who was being transferred to a new post by the constable at Fort George. Several hours into play, and when the table was covered with a drift of bills, this man abruptly announced his identity, declared the game illegal and confiscated all the money. The players and other spectators were outraged and immediately turned into an angry mob. The Skeena River gambler jumped to the policeman's defense and let the man return to his stateroom while he tried to mollify the angry men. After promising to refund any losses, the gambler went to speak to Captain Bucey to see what could be done about the matter. Bucey thought for a moment and then suggested to the gambler that he go talk to the policeman and suggest that if he let the game continue, he can keep half the money he took. The gambler did so, and was surprised when the policeman accepted the bribe. Upon hearing of the policeman's decision, Bucey had his first mate take over at the wheel, and accompanied by two deckhands, he went to the policeman's stateroom and took him down to the lower deck where the game had started again. Once there he told everyone how the policeman had tried to steal their money, but he assured everyone that he had complete control of his own ship, and that this incident would be reported to the magistrate at Fort George, and that the crooked policeman would be on the next steamer south. The bribe was surrendered, and the game continued unhampered. Captain Bucey had won the respect of his passengers, and their friendship.|$|E
500|$|Mega Millions is {{a drawing}} game played in Virginia {{and most other}} U. S. states (Virginia {{is one of the}} {{original}} six states to first offer the game in 1996 when it was then known as [...] "The Big Game"). <b>Jackpots</b> start at $15 million and grow with each drawing {{in which there is no}} jackpot winner. Drawings are held Tuesdays and Fridays. Players select five numbers, 1 through 75, plus a Mega Ball number, 1 through 15. Players also have the option to use the Megaplier, which increases the ticket price by $1 each but raises the value of any non-jackpot prizes won. A ticket matching all six numbers win the jackpot. The jackpot is pari-mutuel, meaning that if multiple tickets match all six numbers, each of them receives an equal share of the total jackpot. Mega Millions jackpot are offered as an annuity, although a cash option is also available.|$|E
2500|$|Jackpot: Some targets on the playfield {{increase}} the scoring value of something else, {{which could be}} as simple as hitting a ramp, or a complicated sequence of targets. Upon their inception, the jackpot was the main goal of most pinball machines in the 1980s. <b>Jackpots</b> would often range from one to four million (back when this was a significant addition to the score), and their value would accrue between games until it was scored. Scoring it was usually a complicated task. Modern games often dilute the meaning of [...] "jackpot". Modern games give off several <b>jackpots</b> in each multiball mode, which is usually quite easy to attain, and the value of today's <b>jackpots</b> is far less significant. Many <b>jackpots</b> awarded during special modes often do not increase at all, but are instead simply fixed-value bonuses.|$|E
50|$|The {{new rules}} {{introduce}} the <b>Jackpot</b> Pool Cap. The <b>jackpot</b> {{will continue to}} rollover until the <b>Jackpot</b> reaches or exceeds €185,000,000, the <b>Jackpot</b> will remain at €185,000,000 and any additional prize money rolled over {{will be added to}} the <b>jackpot</b> pool for the next lower prize level containing at least one winner (5 main numbers + 1 Lucky Star or possibly even just five main numbers).|$|R
50|$|If the <b>jackpot</b> is not won in one episode, {{it goes to}} {{the next}} one, so the next <b>jackpot</b> will be 50,000 RSD, plus <b>jackpot</b> from {{previous}} episode.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to win a maximum amount of 10,000 Euro in a tournament. All players enter a <b>Jackpot</b> battle combat competition with other players on a special <b>Jackpot</b> battle map. One can collect their <b>Jackpot</b> Euros in the game by collecting flotsam. If one doesn't collect the whole 10,000 Euros, they will get their collected amount of <b>Jackpot</b> Euros if {{they are able to}} win the <b>Jackpot</b> battle.|$|R
2500|$|Currently, {{the game}} offers an {{estimated}} First Division prize of $4 million each week often shared between multiple winners (for example 4 winners each receive $1 million), with regular $20 million [...] "Superdraws" [...] taking place approximately 6-7 times a year. In addition, there are Megadraws (usually around Christmas/New Year) with <b>jackpots</b> of around $30 million. If {{there is no}} division 1 winner in Tattslotto it <b>jackpots</b> to $8 million but this rarely happens. A minimum of two standard games must be purchased {{at a cost of}} A$0.60 cents per game, plus agent's commission.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{these games}} run {{continuously}} (every 3–3.5 minutes), and offer <b>jackpots</b> for each level between 7 and 10 spots (NT Keno {{also has a}} Spot 6 jackpot). Both games also have a high/low option called Heads or Tails?, which pre-date and are played identically to the current [...] "Coin Toss" [...] feature in SA Lotteries' Keno. Some NSW venues also offer a Keno Racing game, which groups each line of 10 numbers as a [...] "runner" [...] in a [...] "race" [...] of eight, with positions {{based on the number}} and timing of numbers drawn; traditional horse-racing bets are offered such as [...] "Win", [...] "Place", [...] "Trifecta" [...] and so on.|$|E
2500|$|By 2001, WMS {{introduced}} its very successful Monopoly-themed series of [...] "participation" [...] slots, {{which the company}} licenses or leases to casinos, instead of selling the games to the casinos. [...] The company's participation games have included machines based on such well-known entertainment-related brands as Men in Black, The Price is Right, Match Game, Hollywood Squares, Clint Eastwood, Powerball, Green Acres, The Dukes of Hazzard, Top Gun, The Wizard of Oz, , The Lord of the Rings and Clue. Some of these games are networked within casinos and even between multiple casinos so that players {{have a chance to}} win large <b>jackpots</b> based on the total amount of play received by all of the machines in the network. [...] These branded games proved popular with players and profitable for WMS, as the net licensing revenues and lease fees generated by each game have exceeded the profit margins of its games for sale. Other recent games include Brazilian Beauty and Hot Hot Super Jackpot. WMS Industries acquired a second subsidiary, Netherlands-based gaming company Orion Financement Company B.V., in July 2006.|$|E
50|$|The riddles and Target Number returned, {{but there}} was no multiplier; the Super <b>Jackpot</b> was set at random, ranging from $4,000 to $9,950 in $50 increments. There was no {{separate}} Super <b>Jackpot</b> Riddle in this series. Instead, if a riddle was worth enough to cause a target match, it won both players the Super <b>Jackpot</b> if answered correctly. For each game, the <b>Jackpot</b> started at $100, and riddles were valued anywhere from $50 to $300 (again in $5 increments). Also, if the <b>Jackpot</b> Riddle was not found until the last player, an extra $1,000 was added to the <b>Jackpot.</b> Once the <b>Jackpot</b> Riddle was found and attempted, the King/Queen of the Hill and the person with the <b>Jackpot</b> Riddle traded places no matter the outcome of the riddle's answer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Jackpot</b> Bowling (also {{known as}} Phillies <b>Jackpot</b> Bowling and <b>Jackpot</b> Bowling Starring Milton Berle) was a {{professional}} bowling show on NBC from January 9, 1959 to March 13, 1961.|$|R
