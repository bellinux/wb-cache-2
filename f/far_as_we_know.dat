He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions.

25|$|We are {{not able}} to see how the {{prohibition}} of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory. So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> the denial or affirmation of such a theory does not enter into any recognized mode of worship. Since this cause has been pending in this court, we have been favored, in addition to briefs of counsel and various amici curiae, with a multitude of resolutions, addresses, and communications from scientific bodies, religious factions, and individuals giving us the benefit of their views upon the theory of evolution. Examination of these contributions indicates that Protestants, Catholics, and Jews are divided among themselves in their beliefs, and that there is no unanimity among the members of any religious establishment as to this subject. Belief or unbelief in the theory of evolution is no more a characteristic of any religious establishment or mode of worship than is belief or unbelief in the wisdom of the prohibition laws. It would appear that members of the same churches quite generally disagree as to these things.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} data sources, {{scientists}} {{think that the}} most abundant chemical elements in the martian crust, besides silicon and oxygen, are iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. These elements are major components of the minerals comprising igneous rocks. The elements titanium, chromium, manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, sodium, and chlorine are less abundant but are still important components of many accessory minerals in rocks and of secondary minerals (weathering products) in the dust and soils (the regolith). Hydrogen is present as water (H2O) ice and in hydrated minerals. Carbon occurs as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere and sometimes as dry ice at the poles. An unknown amount of carbon is also stored in carbonates. Molecular nitrogen (N2) makes up 2.7 percent of the atmosphere.

25|$|T-Cell-B-Cell {{discordance}} – A normal {{immune response}} {{is assumed to}} involve B and T cell responses to the same antigen, even if we know that B cells and T cells recognise very different things: conformations {{on the surface of}} a molecule for B cells and pre-processed peptide fragments of proteins for T cells. However, there is nothing as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> that requires this. All that is required is that a B cell recognising antigen X endocytoses and processes a protein Y (normally =X) and presents it to a T cell. Roosnek and Lanzavecchia showed that B cells recognising IgGFc could get help from any T cell responding to an antigen co-endocytosed with IgG by the B cell as part of an immune complex. In coeliac disease it seems likely that B cells recognising tissue transglutamine are helped by T cells recognising gliadin.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 13th century, in the year 1202, Richard de Morins, a canon of Merton, became prior of Dunstable, and with his election the priory entered upon the most interesting period of its history. From 1210 he took over as Dunstable's chronicler. He was evidently a man of very varied interests, and considerable capacity for affairs. Before he had been prior a year he was dispatched on the king's business to Rome; and it was probably owing to his influence that the lordship of Houghton Regis, with other gifts, were confirmed to the priory in 1203. So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> he only went abroad once again, when he attended the Lateran council of 1215, and remained afterwards in Paris for a year to study at the University; but the annals show that he maintained all through his life a keen interest in the affairs of Europe and the East. In 1206 he was made a visitor for all the religious houses of the diocese of Lincoln (except those of the exempt orders), by the authority of the papal legate; in 1212 he was appointed by the pope to preach the cross in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Huntingdonshire, and in the same year was commissioned to make an estimate of the losses suffered by the clergy and the religious in the diocese through the exactions of King John. In 1223 and 1228 he was made visitor to his own order, first in the province of York, and afterwards in the dioceses of Lincoln and Coventry; and last of all, in 1239, when he must have been quite an old man, he helped to draw up and submit to the pope an account of the difficulties between the Archbishop of Canterbury and his suffragans on the subject of visitation. During his term of office, in the year 1219, he secured the right of holding a court at Dunstable for all pleas of the Crown, and of sitting beside the justices itinerant at their visits to the town: a privilege which brought him into less happy relations with the townsmen, and may have helped to hasten their revolt against his authority in 1228. He also successfully established the right of his house to Harlington church in 1223. The priory was twice visited by Henry III. during the time of Richard de Morins: once after the siege of Bedford Castle, and again {{in the midst of the}} troubles connected with the burgesses, whom he attempted to pacify, at the prior's earnest request.|$|E
