5|$|After {{spending}} {{less than a}} year with the team, Groh resigned to accept a coaching job at his alma mater, the University of Virginia. Parcells resigned from his <b>front-office</b> position and was replaced with Chiefs executive Terry Bradway on Parcells' recommendation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Lerner hired former Packers coach Mike Holmgren as team president, moving Keenan {{to chief}} {{financial}} officer. A month later, the owner hired Eagles <b>front-office</b> executive Tom Heckert as general manager. Heckert replaced former general manager George Kokinis, who was fired the previous November. The new management said Mangini would return for a second season.|$|E
5|$|After the disappointing {{end to the}} season, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that <b>front-office</b> changes were coming. In the end, GM Marshall Johnston retired, but Martin and Mlakar were re-signed. John Muckler was hired on June 12, 2002, the Senators' sixth GM, and the first with previous experience as a general manager (with Buffalo). He had been interested in the Ottawa job in 1991, but {{he chose not to}} wait for the Senators to make him an offer, and he joined the Sabres organization.|$|E
5|$|In September 1935, {{after seven}} years, Briskin {{resigned}} from Columbia, failing {{to reach an}} agreement with Harry Cohn over stock options. For years, many in the film industry knew that Briskin was responsible for many of the successes at Columbia, even though studio head Harry Cohn was taking the credit. Shortly after, reports began to circulate that he was headed to 20th Century-Fox. Shortly after that report, he was offered a <b>front-office</b> position at MGM, but turned it down because he wanted to be more actively involved in film production, which was followed by a denial from Fox that he was headed to that studio. One of the rumors which circulated was that Briskin was part of a group aligned with Consolidated Film Industries, which was attempting a takeover of Universal. By year's end, Briskin had agreed to a deal with Warner Bros. to produce 12 films, however that deal never reached fruition and Briskin ended up agreeing to a deal with RKO to join the studio as their vice-president in charge of production. The position was newly created especially for Briskin. B. B. Kahane remained as the overall head of RKO Studios, running all aspects other than production, but there was concern that Briskin would have conflict with long-term RKO producer, Pandro S. Berman. Conflict was averted when Berman received a one-year extension on his contract, wherein he had sole authority over his productions, answering only directly to Kahane.|$|E
25|$|On March 21, 2012, the NFL issued {{sanctions}} to Saints coaches and <b>front-office</b> personnel for {{their roles in}} the scandal.|$|E
25|$|In his autobiography, Lucky Me, {{published}} in 2011, former {{major league baseball}} player and <b>front-office</b> executive Eddie Robinson claims he dated Page before her first marriage.|$|E
25|$|Although these <b>front-office</b> gains continued, Major League Baseball saw {{a lengthy}} slow {{decline in the}} {{percentage}} of black players after the mid-1970s. By 2007, black players made up less than 9% of the major leagues. While this trend is largely attributed to an increased emphasis on the recruitment of players from Latin America (with the number of Hispanic players in the major leagues rising to 29% by 2007), other factors have been cited as well. Hall of Fame player Dave Winfield, for instance, has cited the fact that urban America places less emphasis and provides less resources for youth baseball than in the past. Despite this continued prevalence of Hispanic players, the percentage of black players rose again in 2008 to 10.2%.|$|E
25|$|On February 4, 2010, {{head coach}} Mike Dunleavy resigned, and Kim Hughes was named interim coach. Dunleavy {{retained}} his <b>front-office</b> title and duties for {{just over a}} month, but on March 10 he was fired as General Manager, being replaced by Neil Olshey. Dunleavy received the news of his dismissal from the internet, as well as friends and reporters calling his cell phone. The Los Angeles Times reported that Dunleavy had filed for arbitration and that the Clippers had cut off his salary, even though his guaranteed contract did not end until after the 2010–2011 season. Although the Clippers saw minor improvement, finishing with ten more wins at 29–53, Hughes was fired as head coach {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Daniel Van Voorhis, {{former owner}} of the American Professional Soccer League's San Jose Hawks, {{successfully}} led a San Jose bidding group that was awarded one of Major League Soccer's inaugural teams. At that time, he handed over all existing Hawks player contracts, <b>front-office</b> resources and the rights to play in San Jose State University's Spartan Stadium to MLS in exchange for Type C stock in the league. He also became the franchise's investor/operator until outside concerns forced him to divest himself of these positions prior to the league's launch and accept a buyout from the league, leaving the franchise league-owned for several years. Meanwhile, a direct connection to the earlier Earthquakes came {{in the person of}} Peter Bridgwater, named as general manager of the MLS team. Although Bridgwater still owned the rights to the Earthquakes name and logo, the team became known as the Clash at the urging of Nike, a major investor in MLS.|$|E
500|$|The team's {{progress}} under Davis screeched {{to a halt}} in 2003. The Browns finished 5–11, and Randy Lerner embarked upon a major <b>front-office</b> reshuffling. Policy resigned unexpectedly {{as president}} and chief executive of the Browns in April 2004, saying things had changed after Al Lerner's death. [...] "I opened the door and it was like someone sucked the air and the life out of Berea", he said. [...] "He was a major presence for the organization. I'm talking about the aura, and the inner power of the man." [...] John Collins was named as his replacement. Several other <b>front-office</b> executives also stepped down, including chief contract negotiator Lal Heneghan and lead spokesman Todd Stewart.|$|E
500|$|Although Bill Veeck took much of {{the public}} {{criticism}} for the fiasco, his son Mike suffered repercussions as the actual <b>front-office</b> promoter behind it. [...] Mike Veeck remained with the White Sox until late 1980, when he resigned; his father sold the team to Jerry Reinsdorf soon afterward. [...] He was unable to find a job in baseball for some time after that, leading him to claim that he had been blackballed from the game. For several years, he worked for a jai-alai fronton in Florida, battling alcoholism. As Mike Veeck related, [...] "The second that first guy shimmied down the outfield wall, I knew my life was over!" [...] Mike Veeck has since become an owner of minor league baseball teams. In July 2014 the Charleston RiverDogs, of whom Veeck is president, held a promotion involving the destruction of Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus merchandise. Dahl is still a radio personality in Chicago and also reaches his listeners through podcasting.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, the NHL faced {{competition}} from the newly formed World Hockey Association (WHA). [...] The WHA lured many players away from the NHL, including Derek Sanderson, J. C. Tremblay and Ted Green. [...] The WHA's biggest coup was to lure Bobby Hull from the Black Hawks {{to play for the}} Winnipeg Jets. [...] Hull signed a 10-year deal: five years as a player for $250,000 per season, and five more for $100,000 per season in a <b>front-office</b> position. [...] It also included a $1million signing bonus. [...] The deal totaled $2.7million, and lent instant credibility to the new league. After Hull signed, several other players quickly followed suit. Bernie Parent, Gerry Cheevers, Johnny McKenzie and Rick Ley jumped to the WHA as the NHL suddenly found itself in a war for talent. By the time the 1972–73 WHA season began, 67 players had switched from the NHL to the WHA. [...] Defections continued following the season, and the WHA scored another major coup when it signed Gordie Howe's sons Mark and Marty. [...] The league then convinced Gordie to come out of retirement to play with them on the Houston Aeros.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{was arrested}} on his twenty-first {{birthday}} in Washington, D.C. following his participation in demonstrations against apartheid at the South African Embassy. He had been arrested {{with his father and}} brother the year before in a similar activity. His protest against apartheid extended to weekly demonstrations in front of the South African Consulate in Chicago. Jackson shared the stage with Nelson Mandela when Mandela made his historic speech following his release from a 27-year imprisonment in Cape Town in February 1990. Before entering the House, he became secretary of the Democratic National Committee's Black Caucus, the national field director of the National Rainbow Coalition {{and a member of the}} Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. Jackson served as the national field director of the Rainbow Coalition from 1993 to 1995. Under Jackson's leadership, the Rainbow Coalition attempted to stimulate equitable hiring in the National Basketball Association because while 78% of the league's players were African American, 92% of the <b>front-office</b> executive positions, 88% of the administrative jobs, and 85% of the support positions were held by whites. [...] While serving as the field director for the National Rainbow Coalition, he helped register millions of new voters through a newly instituted national non-partisan program. He also created a voter education program to teach citizens the importance of participating in the political process. He was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and also a founding board member of the Apollo Alliance.|$|E
500|$|Steve DeBerg won the {{starting}} quarterback job over Steve Young in the preseason, but lost it after throwing seven interceptions in the season opener against the San Francisco 49ers, and another two the next week against the Minnesota Vikings. Nose tackle Dave Logan summed up the team's condition after the 49ers game by saying, [...] "the teams we play do not respect us". [...] Players coming from winning teams to the Buccaneers, such as Marvin Powell and Tyrone Keys, found themselves shocked by the constant losing and discouraged by the team's easy acceptance of losses. Keys in particular thought that the Buccaneers were too used to losing, and not bothered by it. Young later criticized the team's will to win, saying that [...] "if they could hide for four quarters and just go home, they would be happy". Powell, one of the highest-paid offensive linemen in the league, was placed on injured reserve {{with a knee injury}} after only a few games. An embarrassing loss to the New Orleans Saints was followed by the release of Jimmie Giles and Kevin House, the top two receivers in Buccaneer history at the time, and former starting fullback Ron Springs. This upset several club veterans, and weakened an offense that already had to compensate for a defense that had allowed over 1,000 rushing yards in the previous four games. League perception was that the Buccaneers were replacing older veterans with younger players who were incapable of taking their places. Said an executive from another team of Giles' replacement, [...] "Calvin Magee runs a 5.2 40...We wouldn't even bring him into camp". Rumors, denied by Culverhouse, began to circulate that secret meetings were being held to arrange replacing Bennett with Steve Spurrier. Nathan Wonsley, the rookie free-agent running back whose play {{was one of the few}} bright spots in the season, was lost to the team after suffering dislocated neck vertebrae during a week 10 loss to the Chicago Bears. After the abnormally large number of injuries suffered during the Bears game, the Buccaneers ended their pattern of suffering fourth-quarter collapses in close games, instead losing their last seven games by an average of over 21 points. With Jerry Bell, a tight end who played a [...] "U-back" [...] position that was crucial to Tampa Bay's running game, suffering a broken ankle in the same game, the Buccaneers were forced to re-sign Ron Springs just to have enough runners in their backfield. Culverhouse, saying that he had made the decision only minutes prior, fired Bennett at a press conference on Dec. 29. Bennett, who had spoken to Culverhouse earlier the same morning, was unaware that he was to be let go. Culverhouse met with Ray Perkins and offered him the Tampa Bay coaching job only hours after firing Bennett. The firing was criticized by some, who felt that no steps were being taken to address the <b>front-office</b> problems that were the real root of the Buccaneers' woes. This criticism was echoed by safety David Greenwood, by then with the Packers, who pointed out the team's cheapness by recounting a 1985 incident in which he wanted to keep a football as a game ball after catching it for an interception. Executive Phil Krueger demanded that Greenwood pay $35 for the football.|$|E
2500|$|On February 1, 1969, Bush {{announced}} that he was resigning as the club's president after holding the position continuously since 1956. Bush, who was 81 years old, stated that he was quitting as the result of [...] "a <b>front-office</b> squabble" [...] with the club's chairman, Louis Hensley, and general manager, Max Schumacher.|$|E
2500|$|Offseason {{coaching}} changes led {{to continued}} accusations of disorganization, as vice-president of operations Ron Wolf resigned, citing only [...] "personal matters". This renewed speculation that head coach John McKay, who replaced Wolf {{with two of}} his own longtime assistants, was trying to consolidate <b>front-office</b> power. The coaching staff was reshuffled, with Tom Bass being named defensive coordinator, and offensive coordinator Joe Gibbs hired away from the St. Louis Cardinals. Offensive line coach Jerry Frei left to take the same position with the Chicago Bears.|$|E
2500|$|McVay's {{contract}} expired and, as expected, was not renewed. He said in 2008 {{that had}} the Giants won, the team likely would have won two more games, his contract would have been renewed, [...] "and now I'd be dead with a heart attack." [...] McVay never coached again, but {{went on to a}} <b>front-office</b> job with the San Francisco 49ers, where he helped develop that team {{into one of the most}} dominant of the 1980s. Andy Robustelli, a former All-Pro defensive end who served as the team's director of operations, was also let go.|$|E
2500|$|Reluctant {{to pursue}} {{projects}} which would necessarily entail <b>front-office</b> controls, the director cautiously rejected {{the script for}} Face/Off several times until it was rewritten to suit him. (The futuristic setting was changed to a contemporary one.) Paramount Pictures also offered the director significantly more freedom to exercise his speciality: emotional characterisation and elaborate action. A complex story of adversaries—each of whom surgically alters their identity—law enforcement agent John Travolta and terrorist Nicolas Cage play a cat-and-mouse game, trapped in each other's outward appearance. Face/Off opened in 1997 to critical acclaim and strong attendance. Grosses in the United States exceeded $100million. [...] Face/Off was also nominated for an Academy Award in the category Sound Effects Editing (Mark Stoeckinger) at the 70th Academy Awards.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his final}} season of 1947, Greenberg {{tied for the}} league lead in walks with 104, with a [...]408 on-base {{percentage}} and finished eighth {{in the league in}} home runs and tenth in slugging percentage. Greenberg became the first major league player to hit 25 or more home runs in a season in each league. Johnny Mize became the second in 1950. [...] Nevertheless, Greenberg retired as a player to take a <b>front-office</b> post with the Cleveland Indians. [...] No player had ever retired after a final season in which they hit so many home runs. [...] Since then, only Ted Williams (1960, 29), Dave Kingman (1986; 35), Mark McGwire (2001; 29), Barry Bonds (2007; 28) and David Ortiz (2016; 38) have hit as many or more homers in their final season.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>front-office</b> woes {{affected}} the team {{regardless of who}} {{was brought in to}} coach. [...] After McKay stepped {{down at the end of}} the 1984 season, Leeman Bennett, who had coached the Atlanta Falcons to their first-ever playoff win, was hired. [...] After two disastrous 214 seasons, he was replaced by former New York Giants and University of Alabama head coach Ray Perkins. [...] Perkins brought back much-needed discipline and [...] "three-a-day" [...] practices, but it proved too much of a good thing. [...] The team was so physically drained by game day that the losses continued to pile up, and Perkins was fired before the end of the 1990 season. [...] Offensive coordinator Richard Williamson was elevated to head coach, and after his brief success in the final remaining games, he retained his head coaching position for the following year. [...] The momentum didn’t last, however, and was fired after the 1991 season when the team went 313.|$|E
2500|$|Evans {{retired from}} umpiring {{following}} the 1927 season {{to become the}} general manager of the Cleveland Indians, earning a substantial annual salary of $30,000. Baseball historian Bill James observed that Evans was the first <b>front-office</b> executive of a major league team to be officially called a [...] "general manager". In this capacity, Evans was credited with taking the Indians from a second division to a first division team. He served as general manager for the next eight years, until budget cuts forced him out in 1935. Rumors circulated that Evans's decision to leave the Indians was also motivated by a disagreement with the Indians' manager, Walter Johnson, over the suspension of third baseman Willie Kamm and the release of catcher Glenn Myatt. Johnson allegedly accused Evans of [...] "disloyalty", while Evans reportedly replied that he refused to be a [...] "yes man". Evans soon found work as chief scout and head of the Boston Red Sox farm system, but left on October 8, 1940 after the team sold Pee Wee Reese to the Brooklyn Dodgers over his objections.|$|E
2500|$|After Cooper {{retired in}} 2001, Houston {{clinched}} the playoffs with a 19-13 record, but {{lost in the}} first round in a sweep to the 2001 eventual champion Los Angeles Sparks. In 2002, when Swoopes was injured most of the year with a torn ACL, the Comets were able to qualify for the playoffs with a 24-8 record, but lost to the Utah Starzz in 3 games. In 2003, they qualified to the playoffs for the 7th straight year, but they lost {{in the first round}} to the Sacramento Monarchs in 3 games. They missed the playoffs {{for the first time in}} franchise history with a record of 13-21 in 2004, but returned to the playoffs with a 19-15 record, finishing 3rd. In the first round, the Comets knocked out the 2004 defending champion Seattle Storm in 3 games, but lost in the conference finals to the Sacramento Monarchs in a sweep, which Sacramento later became WNBA Champions in 2005. Houston would return to the playoffs with an 18-16 record, but lost to the 2005 defending champion Sacramento Monarchs in another sweep. 2006 was the last playoff appearance for the Houston Comets. After the Comets' season ended in 2006, the Comets underwent major <b>front-office</b> changes during the off-season. [...] In October 2006, team owner Leslie Alexander (who also owns the NBA's Houston Rockets team) announced he was selling the Comets, and longtime Head Coach Van Chancellor resigned in January 2007.|$|E
2500|$|The A's offered Boros a <b>front-office</b> job, but he declined. Unemployed {{during a}} {{baseball}} {{season for the}} first time in over 20 years, Boros said he would take some time off but hoped to manage again. He met with the press at his home, drinking from a cup that read [...] "No More Mr. Nice Guy." [...] He noted that the team's management felt he wasn't tough enough on the players, especially Rickey Henderson. Boros said, [...] "This nice guy label — I'm kind of getting clubbed to death with it. The public misinterpreted it when it saw a manager who went and talked to his players and asked their feelings. That all helped to create this impression of too nice a guy, one who can't make up his mind. The players are telling him what to do." [...] Sports Illustrated ran a feature on the firing of Boros several months later. The article refuted the charge that Boros lacked toughness but opened as follows:"When the Oakland A's dismissed Steve Boros in May, the manager's failing was more narrowly defined: He wasn't 'tough enough.' Newspapers across the country solemnly reported this canard. The shortcoming most mentioned was that the A's skipper didn't sufficiently 'stand up for his players'; that is, he didn't kick dirt on umpires or get thrown out of games. It was also revealed that Boros had read more than 100 books, cover to cover, and had other wimpy interests. Real men don't eat quiche. Tough guys don't dance. And so on." ...|$|E
