Prolonged serum starvation treatment usually will induce cell to enter a quiescent state (G 0) or <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis.</b> In the present study, we hypothesized that some microRNAs (miRNAs) may promote cancer cell survival under prolonged serum starvation treatment. We used cell culture medium without any serum to culture HCT- 116 wild type cells infected with the miRNA library consisting of over 600 miRNA precursors in a lentiviral vector. Finally, we enriched miR 944 and miR 596 from the screening experiments and identified them capable of conferring serum starvation resistance [...] We also found that the expression of c-myc and p 53 as well as the phosphorylation of mTOR s 2448 are affected by ectopic expression of miR 596 and miR 944 while cultured in medium with or without serum supplying. These proteins are closely related to the cell survival under stress, which may suggest a possible mechanism for miR 596 and miR 944. Experiments are underway to identify direct target genes of miR 596 and miR 944. The other project that I studied is about the function of Leukemia related protein 16 (LRP 16) in breast cancer progression. Available evidence suggests that LRP 16 is a co-activator of estrogen receptor a (ERa) in promoting ERa-positive breast cancer cell proliferation. Our experiments indicate that LRP 16 is upregulated only in primary breast cancer tissues (StageⅡ) and MCF 7 cell lines, but not in highly metastasis StageⅢ breast cancer tissues and MDA-MB- 231 cell lines. The ectopic expression of LRP 16 in MCF 7 and 231 cell lines causes an opposite effect on cell proliferation. Although it was originally hypothesized that LRP 16 may promote cell proliferation by influencing the production or phosphorylation of p 65, or other NF-κB family members, we could not provide direct evidence to support this. Therefore, we did not go further...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of chemotherapeutic drugs is {{hampered by the}} occurrence of intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. A variety of mechanisms cause drug-resistance. A final common factor, however, is the reduced capacity of drug resistant cells <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into <b>apoptosis</b> following treatment with DNA damaging agents.

The presence of a common factor makes it of interest to search for ways that facilitate the cell <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into <b>apoptosis</b> following exposure <b>to</b> chemotherapeutic drugs. The death receptor ligands tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Fas ligand (FasL) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) are able <b>to</b> induce <b>apoptosis</b> by binding <b>to</b> their cell membrane receptors. Recombinant forms of these ligands are capable to potentiate the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro and in vivo in the animal model.

Systemic treatment of non-human primates with TRAIL did not result in acute toxicity. Animal studies demonstrated antitumor activity of TRAIL and potentiation of the chemotherapy efficacy by TRAIL. Phase I studies with TRAIL will therefore be initiated. As TRAIL is supposed to be non-toxic, it will be a major challenge to design surrogate end points to find the optimal dose in the clinic. In analogy to the herceptin therapy, it may be helpful to characterize the tumor of the patient. In addition, ex vivo exposure of the tumor may also be useful to select the proper ligand therapy for the individual patient. For optimal effect it is most likely that ligand therapy will be combined with chemotherapy, but even a combination of ligands for patient treatments can be envisioned. It is to be expected that smart, small molecules targeting these death receptors will be designed in order to lower toxicity and increase antitumor activity...|$|R

Blood samples were obtained from 17 patients with Behçet's disease, 15 patients with VKH syndrome, and 11 healthy individuals. Mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque and cultured in RPMI 1640 with or without phytohemagglutinin (PHA) for 9 h at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere with 5 % CO(2). The obtained cells were incubated with anti-Fas antibody for 8 h at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere with 5 % CO(2).

A significantly lower percentage of apoptotic lymphocytes after PHA stimulation was noted in Behçet's disease (19. 7 +/- 4. 1 %) and VKH syndrome (20. 4 +/- 6. 9 %) than in controls (26. 1 +/- 7. 3 %).

Excessive sensitivity of isolated Treg <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> has been demonstrated in NOD mice and humans suffering of type 1 diabetes, suggesting a possible role in the immune dysfunction that underlies autoimmune insulitis. In this study the sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> was measured in T cells from new onset diabetic NOD females, comparing purified subsets to mixed cultures. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Apoptotic cells are short lived in vivo and death occurs primarily during isolation, manipulation and culture. Excessive susceptibility of CD 25 (+) T cells <b>to</b> spontaneous <b>apoptosis</b> is characteristic of isolated subsets, however disappears when death is measured in mixed splenocyte cultures. In variance, CD 25 (-) T cells display balanced sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> under both conditions. The isolation procedure removes soluble factors, IL- 2 playing {{a significant}} role in sustaining Treg viability. In addition, pro- and anti-apoptotic signals are transduced by cell-to-cell interactions: CD 3 and CD 28 protect CD 25 (+) T cells from apoptosis, and in parallel sensitize naïve effector cells <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis.</b> Treg viability is modulated both by other T cells and other subsets within mixed splenocyte cultures. Variations in sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> are often hindered by fast proliferation of viable cells, therefore cycling rates are mandatory to adequate interpretation of cell death assays. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of purified Treg <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> is dominated by cytokine deprivation and absence of cell-to-cell interactions, and deviate significantly from measurements in mixed populations. Balanced sensitivity of naïve/effector and regulatory T cells <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> in NOD mice argues against the concept that differential susceptibility affects disease evolution and progression...|$|R

We previously showed that the bile salt taurodeoxycholate has a beneficial effect on the intestinal mucosa through an increase in resistance <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> mediated by nuclear factor (NF) -κB. The current study further characterizes the effect of bile salts on intestinal epithelial cell susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> and determines if the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) regulates bile salt-induced resistance <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis.</b> Exposure of normal intestinal epithelial cells (IEC- 6) to the conjugated bile salts taurodeoxycholate (TDCA) and taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDCA) resulted in an increase in resistance to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and cycloheximide (CHX) -induced apoptosis, and NF-κB activation. Treatment with TDCA and TCDCA resulted in an increase in XIAP expression. Specific inhibition of NF-κB by infection with an adenoviral vector that expresses the IκBα super-repressor (IκBSR) prevented the induction of XIAP expression and the bile salt-mediated resistance <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis.</b> Treatment with the specific XIAP inhibitor Smac also overcame this increase in enterocyte resistance <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis.</b> Bile salts inhibited formation of the active caspase- 3 from its precursor procaspase- 3. Smac prevented the inhibitory effect of bile salts on caspase- 3 activation. These results indicate that bile salts increase intestinal epithelial cell resistance <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> through NF-κB-mediated XIAP expression. Bile salt-induced XIAP mediates resistance <b>to</b> TNF-α/CHX-induced <b>apoptosis,</b> at least partially, through inhibition of caspase- 3 activity.

We examined {{the effect of}} overexpression of HO- 1 on cell growth, expression of p 21, and susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis.</b> MethodsLLC-PK 1 cells were genetically engineered to exhibit stable overexpression of HO- 1. The effects of such overexpression on cell growth, the cell cycle, and the cell cycle-inhibitory protein, p 21, were assessed; additionally, the susceptibility of these HO- 1 overexpressing cells <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> induced by three different stimuli (TNF-α/cycloheximide, staurosporine, or serum deprivation) was evaluated by such methods as the quantitation of caspase- 3 activity, phase contrast microscopy, and the TUNEL method. ResultsHO- 1 overexpressing LLC-PK 1 cells demonstrated cellular hypertrophy, decreased hyperplastic growth, and growth arrest in the G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle. HO- 1 overexpressing cells were markedly resistant <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> induced by TNFα/cycloheximide or staurosporine as assessed by the caspase- 3 activity assay. Such overexpression also conferred resistance <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> induced by serum deprivation as evaluated by the TUNEL method; in these studies, inhibition of HO attenuated the resistance <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis.</b> Expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p 21 CIP 1, WAF 1, SDI 1, as judged by Northern and Western analyses, was significantly increased in HO- 1 overexpressing cells, and decreased as HO activity was inhibited. Moreover, this reduction in expression of p 21 attendant upon the inhibition of HO activity in HO- 1 overexpressing cells paralleled the loss of resistance of these cells <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> when HO activity is inhibited. The pharmacologic inducer of HO- 1, hemin, increased expression of p 21 in wild-type cells and decreased apoptosis provoked by TNF-α/cycloheximide.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{ability of}} living cells to respond {{appropriately}} <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> signals {{is crucial for}} the proper development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. For example, viable cells must be stable enough to appropriately respond <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> signaling so that an irreversible death program is only induced when apoptosis signaling reaches a certain threshold. Previous studies have introduced bistability models in which signaling by caspase- 3 activity represents a key regulator of cell fate in response <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> stimuli. Results In this study, apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling is investigated, and a mathematical model without the requirement for bistability is proposed. In this model, rapid degradation of the active forms of caspases - 8 and - 3 are included, and TNF-signaling is found to induce a pulse of caspase- 3 activation and trigger an irreversible death program. This result agrees with experimental observations. The ability of a cell to respond <b>to,</b> or resist, <b>apoptosis</b> stimuli is also discussed. Furthermore, the activation efficiencies of caspases - 8 and - 3 that are essential to a cell’s response <b>to</b> extracellular <b>apoptosis</b> stimuli are defined. Based on the simulations performed, {{it is observed that}} activation efficiencies must be sufficiently sensitive to appropriately compromise a cell’s resistance and effectiveness in response <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> stimuli. Conclusions Our results suggest that bistability may not be a necessary condition for the induction of apoptosis by TNF signaling. Rather, a sharp increase in caspase- 3 activity might be sufficient to trigger the induction of an irreversible death program. Accordingly, regulation of caspase activity and degradation of active caspases is essential for a cell’s response <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> stimuli. </p...|$|R

Therefore, we compared the effects of Bcl-xS expression delivered by a bcl-xS adenovirus (bcl-xS-Adv) vector, on viability and apoptosis of nontransformed versus transformed mammary epithelial cells.

Meanwhile, the expression of genes and proteins related <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis,</b> such as bax, p 53, bcl- 2, and cytochrome c, was changed in the rat corpus striatum. Together, these findings indicated that silica NP-induced OS in the rat corpus striatum might lead <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis,</b> which contributed <b>to</b> the poor performance of animals in behavioral tests.|$|R
40|$|Aging enhances {{apoptosis}} of hepatocytes {{under normal}} physiological conditions {{and increases the}} susceptibility of hepatocytes <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis</b> whereas life-long dietary restriction suppresses the age-enhanced susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis.</b> We examined the subcellular mechanisms of the age-associated changes and effect of dietary restriction using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry for Fas in the livers of 6 - and 24 -month-old male Fischer 344 rats fed ad libitum or 70 % diet restricted. We also analyzed the level of ordinary and variant forms of Fas mRNA. The ordinary form of Fas mRNA, but not the variant form of Fas mRNA, significantly increased with age. Dietary restriction significantly suppressed the ordinary form of Fas mRNA in advanced age. Aging enhanced Fas immunoreactivity in the hyperplastic bile epithelium and hepatocytes whereas dietary restriction suppressed it. Our findings indicate that Fas protein, particularly the ordinary form of Fas, is involved in age-associated apoptosis of hepatocytes. Fas overexpression in advanced age may explain the age-enhanced susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis.</b> Our results also suggest that dietary restriction suppresses Fas overexpression, resulting in a reduction of the age-enhanced susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>apoptosis...</b>|$|R
