50|$|The fiord {{has three}} branches. At {{the head of}} North Arm is Speel River, a swift-flowing stream which enters the Coast Range for a {{distance}} of 18 mi. The tributary to East Arm, a much shorter inlet, <b>is</b> <b>Whiting</b> River, traversing the mountain system for 35 mi, though not crosscutting it. This river is navigable in small boats for about 4 mi from the mud flats at its mouth. At the head of South Arm are extensive flats which are bare at low water for a distance of 1 mi, and back of these is a low valley 5 mi in length connecting with Holkham Bay. From the shore line, the land rises abruptly to peaks reaching heights of 4000 - 6000 ft. The Snettisham Peninsula, a promontory with peaks averaging 2500 ft in elevation, is connected with the mainland by a low pass less than 100 ft above tide level. Snettisham post office is situated on {{the north end of}} this peninsula and 3 mi inside the entrance to Port Snettisham.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, an {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} farming of marine ‘white' fish, such as cod, has been observed in the aquaculture industry. One species being considered for aquaculture development <b>is</b> <b>whiting</b> (Merlangius merlangus L.). With little data being available on the domestication of this species, our study aimed to characterize spawning behaviour and rhythmicity in captive broodstock and provide original data on egg incubation, embryonic development and larval rearing. The results observed through video recording showed that spawning mainly occurred at night with active courtship behaviour. Daily egg batches were collected from two separate spawning seasons, with an average fertilization success declining from 77 % to 53 %. Time to hatch was inversely related to the incubation temperature and occurred after 78 degree-days (9 days at 8 °C), with emerging larvae {{ranging in size from}} 3. 3 to 3. 46 mm total length and hatch success ranging from 48. 3 % to 99. 9 %. In comparison with a clear water environment, a green water regime during the first days of larval rearing significantly improved larval growth and survival. These results are the first to describe spawning activity, early development and larval performances in whiting and are promising for the potential future development of whiting aquaculture...|$|E

50|$|Until {{the late}} 20th century, <b>whiting</b> <b>was</b> a cheap fish, {{regarded}} as {{food for the}} poor or for pets. <b>Whiting</b> <b>was</b> also allegedly used as a filler in flour, beit wheat, barley or rye. In times of shortages, particularly in the eighteenth century, millers and bakers were commonly accused of using ground whiting to cut their flour as {{the costs of the}} fish was lower than that of the actual grain. The general decline in fish stocks means it is now more highly valued. The other fish that have been given the name <b>whiting</b> <b>are</b> mostly also edible fish. Several species of the drum, or croaker, family (Sciaenidae) <b>are</b> also called <b>whiting,</b> among them the northern kingfish (Menticirrhus saxatilis).|$|R

50|$|The estuarine whiting, Sillago vincenti (also {{known as}} Vincent's <b>whiting),</b> <b>is</b> {{a species of}} benthic inshore marine fish of the smelt-whiting family, Sillaginidae. The estuarine <b>whiting</b> <b>is</b> very similar in {{appearance}} to the northern whiting, Sillago sihama, and as such was mistaken for the latter until 1980, when R.J. McKay identified the species based primarily on swimbladder morphology. The estuarine <b>whiting</b> <b>is</b> distributed along both {{the east and west}} coasts of India, primarily inhabiting the muddy substrates of estuaries. The species is locally important to fisheries in India, and is recognized as having aquaculture potential.|$|R
