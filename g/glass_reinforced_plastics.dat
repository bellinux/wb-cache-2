50|$|Structures {{involves}} {{selection of}} material of construction, structural analysis of global and local {{strength of the}} vessel, vibration of the structural components and structural responses of the vessel during motions in seaway. Depending {{on the type of}} ship, the structure and design will vary in what material to use as well as how much of it some ships are made from <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> but the vast majority are steel with possibly some aluminium in the superstructure. The complete structure of the ship is designed with panels shaped in a rectangular form consisting of steel plating supported on four edges. Combined in a large surface area the Grillages create the hull of the ship, deck, and bulkheads while still providing mutual support of the frames. Though the structure of the ship is sturdy enough to hold itself together the main force it has to overcome is longitudinal bending creating a strain against its hull, its structure must be designed so that the material is disposed as much forward and aft as possible. The principal longitudinal elements are the deck, shell plating, inner bottom all of which are in the form of grillages, and additional longitudinal stretching to these. The dimensions of the ship are in order to create enough spacing between the stiffeners in prevention of buckling. Warships have used a longitudinal system of stiffening that many modern commercial vessels have adopted. This system was widely used in early merchant ships in the great eastern, it later shifted to transversely framed structure another concept in ship hull design that proved more practical. This system was later implemented on modern vessels such as tankers because of its popularity and was then named the Isherwood system. The arrangement of the Isherwood system consists of stiffening decks both side and bottom by longitudinal members, they are separated enough so they have the same distance between them ass the frames and beams. This system works by spacing out the transverse members that support the longitudinal by about 3 or 4 meters, with the wide spacing this causes the traverse strength needed by displacing the amount of force the bulkheads provide.|$|E

Some particular structures (protective shelters, nuclear reactor containment, offshore structures, military structures, chemical or Energy production plant) may be subjected to loading at very high rate of stress or strain caused by impact of missiles or flying objects, also by vehicle collisions or impulses due to explosions and earthquakes.

40|$|Many failure {{theories}} have been postulated {{to predict the}} behaviour of <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> (GRP) under complex stresses. However, the efficient use of these theories for design purposes is inhibited because the experimental complex stress data needed to verify and discriminate between them is not available. This thesis presents some of the experimental data required. Uniaxial stress test results from flat laminates, and biaxial stress test results from thin-walled tubes under combined internal pressure and axial force, are presented for various damage states under both static and fatigue loading for a plane isotropic material and an orthotropic material. The data were then used to establish which failure theory provided the most acceptable prediction of the observed behaviour. For ultimate strength, the Norris Failure theory gave adequate predictions, but not for resin cracking. The most generally acceptable predictions, for both materials, were given by those theories whose equations contain a constant which is derived from complex stress data, these being the modified Marin and the strength tensor theories. For the orthotropic material, three-dimensional representations of the plane stress ultimate strength and damage failure surfaces are presented for both static and fatigue loading. However, even though {{a considerable number of}} specimens were tested, only very few failure surface sections were experimentally established. It was found for both materials that fatigue loading was more damaging than static loading, for both uniaxial and biaxial stress conditions, and that the behaviour of the materials was dependent upon the ratio of the biaxial stresses. Jointed reinforcement layers severely affect the zero-tension fatigue behaviour of the plane isotropic material, but the effect on the orthotropic material decreases with increasing fatigue life. The effect of macro-voids on crack initiation should be acknowledged if damage is used as a design criterion...|$|E

40|$|Lightweight {{engineering}} plastics {{have been}} increasingly used in automotive applications(3), this tends toward more fuel efficient vehicles(1). <b>Glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> commonly include thermosetting polymers. These cannot be re-moulded, unlike thermoplastics, thus thermoset scrap is currently disposed of in landfill. This is increasingly targeted by legislation(14) and {{is becoming more}} expensive. This thesis describes work to maximise resource recovery from scrap thermoset composites. A review of relevant literature identified thermal processes for treating scrap thermoset composites. Combustion is particularly suitable for the mixed and contaminated materials arising from end of life vehicles. The literature showed that heating glass fibres reduced their properties, which is a concern for any thermal recycling process. The methodology of this work is to recover energy from the composite polymer and reuse the incombustible residues. Two experimental processes are reported: Fluidised Bed Co-combustion of Thermoset Composites with Coal. The common composite filler of calcium carbonate captures the sulphur emissions from the coal combustion. Results show that scrap composites can successfully be burned in a commercial scale fluidised bed. Retention of the sulphur from the coal by the composite filler was up to 75 % of the input. Although a technical success, economic analysis shows this disposal to be unviable compared with similar desulphurisation via crushed limestone. Fluidised Bed Thermal Processing Rig for Recovering Glass Fibres. The incombustible constituents of a crushed Sheet Moulding Compound were released from processing above 400 ° C in the fluidised bed test rig. The reinforcing glass fibres were elutriated as monofilaments, suitable {{for use in a}} veil product, and recovered from the flue gases. Scanning Electron Microscopy showed that the fibres were intact. The tensile strength of fibres from 450 °C processing was reduced by approximately 50 % and by 90 % from 650 °C(73). Strength was also found to reduce with increasing time at a temperature(76). Flue gas analysis showed that carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons were present. This indicated that full combustion did not take place and the associated heat energy lost. Measured nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide concentrations were low. After initial testing, the test rig was refined by the incorporation of a Rotating Screen Collector to separate the fillers and fibres. The fibre contamination was reduced by 50 % via this novel equipment. Fibre recovery rates of up to 57 % were achieved. Resin Decomposition Model.

40|$|The {{wind turbine}} {{industry}} is rapidly growing, and wind turbines are growing in size accordingly. For the wind turbines {{in the past}} and up to the present commercial size, aerodynamic forces have basically governed all blade designs. However, as the turbines continue to grow in size, the gravity forces should therefore be carefully included in the design process for large wind turbine blades. In the present study, the aerodynamic and gravity forces together with their corresponding stress levels have been simulated for 3 different wind turbine sizes with diameter of 60 m, 90 m and 120 m. Two different upscaling models have been used for this simulation. A simple upscaling model uses analytical functions to obtain first estimates for the forces, bending moments and stresses. An advanced upscaling model couples a blade element momentum theory together with beam considerations. An aerodynamic analysis is performed in the advanced upscaling model within the framework that the structural analysis requires. Analytical functions are used in this analysis to describe the airfoils of the turbine blade. The aerodynamic performance is evaluated with respect to the annual energy production. For both models, a box spar of <b>Glass</b> <b>Reinforced</b> <b>Plastics</b> within the airfoil carries the loads. A sandwich material surrounds the airfoil. In addition, a trailing edge spline is inserted to ensure edgewise bending strength in the advanced upscaling model. Results from the simulations show that wind turbines between 60 m and 90 m in diameter are structurally designed to withstand the aerodynamic flapwise stresses. Simulations of the wind turbine with a diameter of 120 m show that the edgewise gravity stresses become more severe than the aerodynamic flapwise stresses for the inner aerodynamic sections. Hence, a design shift occurs for these inner sections. To reduce the edgewise stresses, a redesign of the blade geometry is therefore needed. Several redesign suggestions are implemented and discussed. Based on the simulation results and the redesign suggestions for wind turbine with a diameter of 120 m, scaling recommendations for the blade geometry are obtained. Scaling recommendations for both the blade planform, included chord and twist, and the blade airfoils presented. The airfoil parameters include relative thickness, position of maximum thickness, camber, positon of maximum camber and nose radius of the airfoil. In addition, the structural geometry within the airfoil, including spar geometry and spar material, are also subjected to scaling guidelines. The scaling recommendations presented in this study apply for wind turbines between 60 m and 120 m in diameter. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|Polymer {{composite}} materials, particularly <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> (GRP), {{are increasingly}} {{being used in the}} offshore industry and their behaviour in fire is studied using mathematical and numerical modelling. A generalised finite element method is developed to analyse the thermally induced response of a widely used GRP, consisting of polyester resin and glass fibre reinforcement. GRP panels, pipes and joins subject to hydrocarbon fires (i. e. high temperatures) are studied. One- and two-dimensional mathematical models are developed to study the fire performance of: (i) single-skinned GRP panels, (ii) twin-skinned GRP-Vermiculux sandwich panels, and (iii) thin and thick GRP joins (step panels). The models involve thermochemical decomposition of the material (pyrolysis) and include: (i) transient heat conduction, (ii) gas mass movement and internal heat convection of pyrolysis gases, (iii) mass loss and Arrhenius rate decomposition of the resin material into gases and char, and (iv) endothermicity of pyrolysis. The effect of imperfect bonding on heat transfer in sandwich panels and the accumulation of pyrolysis gases and internal pressurisation in thick step panels are also included. The models may be used with any combination of steady or time-dependent boundary conditions including temperature, radiation, chemical reactions, mass diffusion and free and forced convections. Various positions of panels, i. e. vertical, horizontal and inclined are studied. The material is assumed homogeneous and orthotropic with respect to thermal and transport properties which may vary with temperature, pore pressure and moisture. The finite element models use weighted residual approach with linear elements for one- dimensional and quadrilateral elements for two-dimensional. Non-linear terms and coefficients are evaluated explicitly using an iterative-updating method and nodal temperatures and pore pressures implicitly using Crank-Nicolson solution. The classical finite difference time stepping algorithm is used where an efficient solution is achieved using variable time step. Numerical results are presented in the form of temperature versus time, temperature versus distance, pore pressure versus distance, mass loss versus distance and moisture versus distance and compared with experimental data where available. It is shown that the decomposition of the material, endothermicity of pyrolysis and the movement of pyrolysis gases make substantial contributions towards the cooling behaviour and delaying the bum-through. The effect of gas mass movement and surface chemical reactions across the boundary layer adjacent to the fire-exposed surface is very important in introducing a theoretical boundary condition. An investigation into the effect of inclusion the variable thermal properties reveals considerable improvement in thermal predictions. Sandwich panels consisting of GRP/Vermiculux/GRP offer good thermal insulation. Thermal contact resistance at an imperfect bonding is important where an average difference of 12 % can be found between the thermal responses of sandwich panels with perfect and imperfect bonding. For thin GRP step panels, a one-dimensional solution is found adequate to predict the fire resistance behaviour of the material. For thick GRP step panels, the effect of internal pressurisation coupled with temperature on the thermal response is considerable...|$|E
