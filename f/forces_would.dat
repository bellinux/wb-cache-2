5|$|In November 1996, SPLA leader John Garang gave {{warning that}} his <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> attack the Adar Yale oil field.|$|E
5|$|Besieged <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> {{sometimes}} launch sorties in {{an attempt}} to fire the attackers' camps or equipment. When Hugh Capet besieged Laon in 986–987, his troops became drunk one night, and Duke Charles's men sallied forth and torched the camp, forcing Hugh to abandon the siege.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{was hoping}} that the Allied <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> attack, and to {{encourage}} them, he deliberately weakened his right flank. On 28 November Napoleon met with his marshals at Imperial Headquarters, who informed him of their qualms about the forthcoming battle. He shrugged off their suggestion of retreat.|$|E
50|$|An Indigenous Police <b>force</b> <b>would</b> {{be formed}} within the Colombian National Police.|$|R

5|$|On August 2, 1990, Saddam Hussein sent an invading {{force of}} Iraqi troops into Kuwait. According to the United States {{government}} Hussein's <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> continue south into Saudi Arabia's oil fields. The United States military deployment to Saudi Arabia, Operation Desert Shield, grew rapidly {{to become the}} largest American deployment since the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the war, these words would prove prophetic. No Confederate <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> bring Fort Greble under fire during its entire {{four-year}} active military career, and its garrison units, rotated regularly, served quietly behind its earthen walls.|$|E
5|$|Park's {{equivalent}} {{and another}} of Dowding's commanders, AOC 12 Group Trafford Leigh-Mallory, held the opposite view. For him, large <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> win the battle by destroying large numbers of the enemy. This attrition strategy would use {{the concept of the}} Big Wing as its basis.|$|E
5|$|A second Anglo-Franco-Hellenic <b>force</b> <b>would</b> then {{attack the}} 1st Bulgarian Army between Kožuf and Lake Doiran, {{preventing}} it from forming new defensive {{positions in the}} area. The initial advance would allow the Armée d'Orient to progress in support of other units first to Prilep, Disma and Borran. In the meantime, an Anglo-Hellenic <b>force</b> <b>would</b> strike Mount Belasica, occupying the Rupel Pass.|$|R
50|$|The Bailies {{displayed}} {{vision and}} innovation in setting out their proposals {{insisting that the}} <b>force</b> <b>would</b> be run by a Watch Committee of elected citizens, known as Commissioners. The <b>force</b> <b>would</b> wear uniforms with numbered badges with 'Police' inscribed on them and each member would lodge £50 to guarantee their good conduct. The <b>force</b> of eight <b>would</b> provide twenty-four-hour patrols (supplementing the Police Watchmen who were on static points throughout the night) to prevent crime and detect offenders.|$|R
5000|$|The {{communist}} <b>force</b> <b>would</b> {{be driven}} {{out by the}} Kuomintang force after reaching Dabie Shan.|$|R
5|$|The Polish {{capture of}} Vilnius {{set the stage}} for further {{escalation}} of Polish conflicts with Soviet Russia and Lithuania. In coming months, Polish <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> push steadily eastward, launching Operation Minsk in August.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle changed the {{perception}} of the rebel movement in Mexico. Before Madero's victory many believed that the rebel <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> scatter {{as soon as they were}} confronted by federal troops. The fall of Juárez proved that notion wrong and revealed the real strength of the rebel forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{planet is}} {{unlikely}} to have large moons, since tidal <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales relative {{to the age of}} the system.|$|E
5000|$|... at {{daylight}} 23 December 1978 the Argentine Air <b>Force</b> <b>would</b> begin {{attacks against}} Chilean Air Force.|$|R
50|$|During the day {{the force}} {{anchored}} in Plymouth Sound, as air defence for Plymouth. At dusk, {{under cover of darkness}} and maintaining radio and radar silence, the <b>force</b> <b>would</b> proceed at full speed to the French coast to keep the German s bottled up in Brest. The <b>force</b> <b>would</b> return to Plymouth by daylight. By day the RAF would patrol the Channel and by night, Plymouth.|$|R
50|$|General Pope {{learned on}} the evening of December 18 that Robertson’s <b>force</b> <b>would</b> be camped at Milford.|$|R
5|$|When Luna {{saw that}} the American advance had halted, mainly to {{stabilize}} their lines, he again mobilized his troops to attack La Loma on February 10. Fierce fighting ensued but the Filipinos were forced to withdraw thereafter. Caloocan was left with American forces {{in control of the}} southern terminus of the Manila to Dagupan railway, along with five engines, fifty passenger coaches, and a hundred freight cars. After consolidating control of Caloocan, the obvious next objective for American <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> be the Republic capital at Malolos. However, General Otis delayed for almost a month in hopes that Filipino <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> be deployed in its defense.|$|E
5|$|According to the storyline for Ironside, {{ten days}} {{following}} D-Day, Allied <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> {{land in the}} Bordeaux region. This force would spend around twelve days establishing a bridgehead before advancing to meet formations supposedly part of an invasion of the Mediterranean coast of France (in reality these were fictional landings as well, part of another Bodyguard deception called Operation Vendetta). The supposed target of Ironside was {{the mouth of the}} Gironde estuary, with a landing site at Royan.|$|E
5|$|After {{reading the}} {{captured}} documents, on 7 January 1941 Japanese Admiral Yamamoto {{wrote to the}} Naval Minister asking whether, if Japan knocked out America, the remaining British and Dutch <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> be suitably weakened for the Japanese to deliver a deathblow. Thereby, Nanshin-ron, {{the concept of the}} Japanese Navy conducting a southern campaign quickly matured and gained further proponents.|$|E
50|$|In November 1932, per {{a request}} from Mussolini, De Bono wrote up a plan for an {{invasion}} of Ethiopia. What he wrote indicated that he envisioned a traditional mode of penetration. A limited <b>force</b> <b>would</b> move gradually southward from Eritrea. The <b>force</b> <b>would</b> establish bases of strength and, from these bases, advance against increasingly weakened and disorganized opponents. The invasion DeBono envisioned would be cheap, easy, safe and slow.|$|R
50|$|Corollary 3 {{shows that}} if P2 is {{proportional}} to R, then the centripetal <b>force</b> <b>would</b> be independent of R.|$|R
50|$|Corollary 4 {{shows that}} if P2 is {{proportional}} to R2, then the centripetal <b>force</b> <b>would</b> be proportional to 1/R.|$|R
5|$|Ballaban's {{camp was}} {{located on the}} hills {{southwest}} of Krujë and {{at the bottom of}} the mountain nowadays known as Mt. Sarisalltëk, he placed a guarding force. The rest of his army surrounded Krujë. Skanderbeg and his allies marched through the mouth of the Mat River and cut through the woods of Jonima to the boundaries of Krujë. Skanderbeg's commanders were assigned different groups for an assault on the main Ottoman camp: northern Albanian <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> be put under Dukagjini's command, Venetian battalions were under the command of Moneta, and Skanderbeg's most trusted <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> be assigned to another group under his command; Krujë's garrison would continue to defend the fortress. Moneta's and Dukagjini's men would attack the besieging forces from the north and Skanderbeg's men would attack from south of Krujë while also blocking any possible Ottoman reinforcements from the east. Skanderbeg first assaulted the guarding force which Ballaban had left and he gained control of this strategic point. Skanderbeg then managed to defeat the Ottoman relief forces under Ballaban's brother, Jonuz, and captured him and his son. Four days later, an organized attack from Skanderbeg and the forces from Krujë was carried during which Ballaban forces were retreated and he himself was killed in the resulting clashes by Gjergj Lleshi (Georgius Alexius).|$|E
5|$|By late {{afternoon}} of 19 August, Canadian and Polish forces had {{linked with the}} US 80th Division and 90th Division already stationed in the town. The Falaise Gap had been closed, trapping Model′s forces. As the linkup occurred, Model′s II SS Panzer Corps had begun its counterattack against Polish forces on Hill 262, hoping to reopen the pocket. With American and Canadian forces facing German counterattacks in their sectors, the Polish <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> have to defend against two veteran Panzer divisions to keep the gap closed.|$|E
5|$|General Ludwig Kübler's XLIX Corps would {{conduct the}} actual {{attack on the}} Rock. The assault <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> {{comprise}} the Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland, the 98th Regiment of the 1st Mountain Division, 26 medium and heavy artillery battalions, three observation battalions, three engineer battalions, two smoke battalions, a detachment of 150 Brandenburgers, and up to 150 miniature remote controlled demolition vehicles (Goliaths), packed with high explosives.|$|E

5|$|In Aden in May 1964, Hunter FGA.9s and FR.10s of No. 43 Squadron RAF and No. 8 Squadron RAF {{were used}} {{extensively}} during the Radfan campaign against insurgents attempting {{to overthrow the}} Federation of South Arabia. SAS <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> routinely call in air strikes that required considerable precision, and, predominantly using 3-inch high explosive rockets and 30mm ADEN cannon, the Hunter proved an able ground-attack platform. Both squadrons continued operations with their Hunters until the UK withdrew from Aden in November 1967.|$|E
5|$|In June 1658 it {{was decided}} that the Swedish <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> attack. On August 6, 1658 a fleet of 70 ships with 5,700 men and 18 pieces of light {{artillery}} embarked upon a journey to Denmark. Since the previous war, Jylland was still occupied by Swedish troops and there were troops on Fyn. In addition to this, Field Marshal Gustav Otto Stenbock had assembled reinforcements in Scania in Southern Sweden. The plan was for the Swedish army to march on Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|On 22 September the German battle {{group in}} Norway was {{attacked}} by several British midget submarines. This raid inflicted significant damage on Tirpitz, leaving the battleship unable to proceed to sea until repairs were complete. Once this was known to the Allies, {{the commander of the}} Home Fleet, Admiral Bruce Fraser, judged that the changed balance of <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> allow his force to assume a more offensive role by attacking German shipping off Norway and restarting the Arctic Convoys to the Soviet Union.|$|E
