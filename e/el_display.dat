50|$|Thin film {{phosphor}} electroluminescence {{was first}} commercialized during the 1980s by Sharp Corporation in Japan, Finlux (Oy Lohja Ab) in Finland, and Planar Systems in the USA. Here, bright, long-life light emission is achieved in thin film yellow-emitting manganese-doped zinc sulfide material. Displays using this technology were manufactured for medical and vehicle applications where ruggedness and wide viewing angles were crucial, and liquid crystal displays were not well developed. In 1992, Timex introduced its Indiglo <b>EL</b> <b>display</b> on some watches.|$|E
40|$|Since 1983, the Space Transportation System (STS) had {{routinely}} flown the GRiD 1139 (80286) {{laptop computer}} as a portable onboard computing resource. In {{the spring of}} 1988, the GRiD 1530, an 80386 based machine, was chosen to replace the GRiD 1139. Human factors ground evaluations and detailed test objectives (DTO) examined the usability of the available display types under different lighting conditions and various angle deviations. All proved unsuitable due to either flight qualification of usability problems. In 1990, an Electroluminescent (<b>EL)</b> <b>display</b> for the GRiD 1530 became flight qualified and another DTO was undertaken to examine this display on-orbit. Under conditions of indirect sunlight and low ambient light, the readability {{of the text and}} graphics was only limited by the observer's distance from the display. Although a problem of direct sunlight viewing still existed, there were no problems with large angular deviations nor dark adaptation. No further evaluations were deemed necessary. The GRiD 1530 with the <b>EL</b> <b>display</b> was accepted by the STS program as the new standard for the PGSC...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 4 years, SrS:Ce <b>EL</b> <b>display</b> devices have been {{steadily}} improved at Heinrich-Hertz-Institut (HHI) up to efficiencies of 2 lm/W with improved blue performance and stability. For the new SrS:Ce process, a filtered blue luminance exceeding 25 cd/m 2 at 60 Hz driving frequency could be achieved. The successful basic material development will enable inorganic EL to provide full color displays {{in the near}} future. A special application for this approach {{is a very small}} and lightweight full color active matrix display on silicon developed by Planar, which provides a VGA picture on a 1 inch diagonal for small view-finders and virtual reality applications...|$|E

40|$|A new wet-chemical {{method is}} {{described}} for the deposition of electrically conducting copper sulfide coating on $ZnS: Mn$ powder phosphors for the electroluminescent (EL) devices {{working in the}} direct current (DC) mode. The nature of the coated layers and the changes undergone by them in the DCEL devices are investigated by X-ray photoelectron and Auger spectroscopy. The as-coated layers of < 150 nm have dominant $Cu^+$ character. The $Cu_xS/ZnS$ interface acquires sharper concentration profile on heating, accompanied by the interaction with oxygen from the ambient atmosphere. This leads to increased resistivity of the coating through the incorporation of $O^ 2 ^-$ and the out-diffusion of $Cu$-ions to upper regions. Heat treatment alters charge state of copper to $Cu^ 2 ^+$ at deeper regions towards $ZnS$. Similar changes are noticed for the phosphor recovered from the electrically ‘formed’ <b>EL</b> <b>display</b> panels...|$|E
40|$|Electroluminescent {{displays}} {{are part}} of an emerging technology known as printed electronics. Most identify printed electronics with purely electronic purposes such as the Radio frequency identification (RFID). Now the electronics and graphic communication industries have come together to create of new forms of products that interact with customers. Flexible, electronic circuits use functional inks and traditional printing methods such as screen printing, gravure, and inkjet. Printed electronics are perfect for low performance applications, such as displays, labels, clothing and batteries. This paper focuses on creating an interactive electroluminescent (<b>EL)</b> <b>display.</b> In selling a product, displays are important because most customers purchase a product for the first time based on how the product draws customers’ attention. The display’s purpose is to create point of purchase advertising that draws the customers’ attention to the product advertised by the electroluminescent display over other conventional displays in a store...|$|E
40|$|Electroluminescent (EL) {{displays}} {{are well}} known for their superior visual performance (brightness and contrast) and environmental performance (durability) characteristics. These characteristics contributed to Freightliner Corporation’s selection of Planar Systems, Inc. to build a custom electroluminescent display that measures 80 pixels in height and 320 pixels in width for their Truck Productivity Computer. The Truck Productivity Computer is an open-platform information, communication, and integration system that fits in a standard (DIN 1) radio slot in a truck dashboard. When compared to most conventional in-vehicle displays, the emissive EL technology offers increased brightness and contrast ratio. Considering these advantages {{and the type of}} information to be displayed, traditional human factors display guidelines, based primarily on other display types, were thought to be unsuitable for recommending character height for this display. It was hypothesized that a smaller font may be suitable for this display technology, while not sacrificing the required recognition times necessary for safe operation of the truck. Study 1, as described in this paper, was a human factors investigation to test whether character-size recommendations for conventional displays would apply to the <b>EL</b> <b>display</b> in this specific application. A soft-key label reading test and a subjective evaluation of font size was undertaken. It was found that subjects could read smaller text with an adequate level of accuracy and comfort in an appropriately short period of time.

40|$|Full colour {{electroluminescent}} (<b>EL)</b> <b>displays</b> {{according to}} the "colour by white" concept are a promising candidate for various future display applications. ZnS:Mn/SrS:Ce multilayer phosphors have demonstrated their capability to fulfil the requirements of this concept. While ZnS:Mn is a standard industrial process SrS:Ce needs further improvements. Very recently, a new process to fabricate efficient SrS:Ce EL devices based on a novel S-precursor during reactive evaporation has been developed. In conventional device structures, efficiencies up to 1. 4 Im/W have been obtained. Introducing this new process into a ZnS:Mn/SrS:Ce multilayer device, yellowish-white luminance level as high as 4200 cd/m 2 at 1 kHz drive was reached.

40|$|Human endothelial lipase (EL) is {{a member}} of a family of lipases and phospholipases that are {{involved}} in the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins. <b>EL</b> <b>displays</b> a preference to hydrolyze lipids in HDL. We report here that a naturally occurring low frequency coding variant in the EL gene (LIPG), glycine- 26 to serine (G 26 S), is significantly more common in African-American individuals with elevated HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. To test the hypothesis that this variant results in reduced EL function, we extensively characterized and compared the catalytic and noncatalytic functions of the G 26 S variant and wild-type (WT) EL. While the catalytic-specific activity of G 26 S EL is similar to WT EL, its secretion is markedly reduced. Consistent with this observation, we found that carriers of the G 26 S variant had significantly reduced plasma levels of EL protein. Thus, this N-terminal variant results in reduced secretion of EL protein, plausibly leading to increased HDL-C levels...|$|R
