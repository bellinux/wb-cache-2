30|$|For {{both the}} systems mentioned, the dynamic IFT {{decreases}} with pressure; however, {{the rate of}} reduction slightly decreases at <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions. This {{could be due to}} the fact that the CO 2 solubility at low pressures significantly improves by <b>pressure,</b> whereas at <b>higher</b> <b>pressures</b> CO 2 solubility slightly increases with pressure. Asphaltene accumulation at the interface at <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions could be another likely reason during which the interface becomes more rigid.|$|R
5|$|A <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> system {{over the}} central United States drifted east {{and added a}} westward {{component}} to Gordon's southward motion, pulling the storm southwest towards Florida. The persistent shear and a continued lack of deep convection eventually reduced the storm's winds to below tropical storm force, and on the morning on November 20 Gordon became a tropical depression. The <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> system over the continent continued pulling the depression towards the west until it made its final landfall near Cape Canaveral that night with winds of 30 mph (45 km/h). Between its three Floridian landfalls, Hurricane Gordon dumped 5–10 in (13–25 cm) of rain on Florida, with a station at Cooperstown recording 16.1 in (40.9 cm). The storm moved northward across Florida, northeastward across Georgia, and finally merged with a frontal system over South Carolina.|$|E

5|$|On December19, a {{tropical}} depression formed near St. Brandon. With {{an area of}} <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> to the southeast, the depression moved to the northeast and was named Clera, after a Dvorak rating of 2.5. It only achieved winds of 50km/h (30mph) before weakening.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} nitrogen clathrate phases depending on <b>pressure.</b> At <b>higher</b> <b>pressures</b> the CS-II phase changes to a hexagonal structure termed SH. The SH unit cell contains 34 water molecules, 20 small cavities (512), 20 medium cavities (435663) and 36 large cavities (51268). At still <b>higher</b> <b>pressures</b> a tetragonal form (termed ST) (425864) exists. At even <b>higher</b> <b>pressures</b> a phase called a filled ice structure (FIS) is formed. This has alternate layers {{of water and}} nitrogen molecules.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{previous}} cartridges, the [...]375 H&H {{operates at}} relatively <b>higher</b> <b>pressures</b> and was designed {{from the outset}} for use with smokeless powders that can generate <b>higher</b> <b>pressures</b> and thus <b>higher</b> velocities. However, when the cartridge was designed pressure levels were held to [...] as cordite was sensitive to temperature and could cause dangerously <b>high</b> <b>pressures</b> in the hot tropical climates of Africa and India. However, modern smokeless powders are not as sensitive to ambient temperatures as cordite and therefore both the C.I.P. and SAAMI provide far <b>higher</b> allowable <b>pressures</b> than the original loading of the cartridge allowed.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of the Andes and thus, the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of the Andes, it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E
5|$|Unfavorable northerly {{vertical}} {{wind shear}} persisted {{through much of}} Elena's duration, which prohibited the development of convection. An approaching frontal trough weakened the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> system to its north, which resulted in Elena turning northwestward toward the Texas coastline. The storm remained poorly organized, failing to strengthen further, and on September 1 it made landfall on Matagorda Island as a minimal tropical storm. The cyclone rapidly weakened after moving ashore, and early on September 2 Elena degenerated into a remnant low pressure area over southeastern Texas. Trapped between two <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> systems, the remnant mid-level circulation drifted southwestward just inland for several days before dissipating on September 6.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{ridge of}} <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> {{continued}} {{to push the}} system west, towards the Caribbean Sea. That afternoon, convective banding and increasing upper-level outflow strengthened the storm to a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast late on July 10. The wave entered the Bahamas on July 21 and organized into Tropical Depression Six while 70miles (110km) east of Eleuthera. Initially the storm was predicted to execute a clockwise loop and drift to the west {{in response to a}} <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> system. Several models indicated the possibility of the storm to drift westward into central Florida. Soon after the depression formed, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Franklin.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September16 with copious convection. It tracked westward, developing into Tropical Depression Twelve on September21 while located {{a few hundred miles}} west of Cape Verde. Without intensifying further, the depression turned northward, due to a weakness caused by the deepening of a 200 mbar cut-off low near the Iberian Peninsula. Under the influence of a building <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> area, the depression turned to a northwest and later westward drift. It into Tropical Storm Josephine on September24, although increased wind shear from a trough weakened the storm back to a tropical depression on September26. It remained weak for several days, gradually turning to the north due to a weak trough over the northwestern Atlantic. On October1, another <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> area halted its northward movement, causing Josephine to turn to the east. That day, it re-intensified into a tropical storm as it began to execute a small cyclonic loop. An approaching trough caused Josephine to accelerate north-northeastward, and with favorable conditions it intensified into a hurricane on October5, after existing nearly two weeks.|$|E

5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are formed when underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses.

50|$|<b>Higher</b> <b>pressures</b> are {{typically}} required to condense these new environmentally friendly refrigerants {{compared to those}} that are being phased out. Small diameter copper tubes are more desirable in applications with <b>higher</b> <b>pressures.</b> For tubes of the same thickness, smaller diameter tubes can withstand <b>higher</b> <b>pressures</b> than larger diameter tubes. Hence, as tube diameters decrease, burst pressures increase. This is because working pressure is directly proportional to wall thickness and inversely proportional to diameter. By designing coils with shorter tube lengths, less work is required to circulate the refrigerant. Therefore, refrigerant pressure drop factors due to small diameter tubes can be offset.|$|R
