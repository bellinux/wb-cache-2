500|$|Tubman {{also carried}} a revolver, {{and was not}} afraid to use it. The gun afforded some {{protection}} from the ever-present slave catchers and their dogs; however, she also purportedly threatened to shoot any escaped slave who tried to turn back on the journey since that would threaten {{the safety of the}} remaining group. Tubman told the tale of one man who insisted <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to the plantation when morale got low among a group of fugitive slaves. She pointed the gun at his head and said, [...] "You go on or die." [...] Several days later, he was with the group as they entered the United Province of Canada.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{put himself}} into {{the power of his}} inferiors, and he knew it. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> subjugate himself. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ordered about by petty canaille of non-{{commissioned}} officers--and even commissioned officers. <b>He</b> who <b>was</b> born and bred free. Should he do it? ...|$|R
6000|$|ALL the {{way home}} from Maine, Babbitt <b>was</b> certain that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a changed man. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{converted}} <b>to</b> serenity. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cease worrying about business. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have more [...] "interests"--theaters, public affairs, reading. And suddenly, as he finished an especially heavy cigar, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop smoking.|$|R
6000|$|... "There now, Dan, <b>he</b> says <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> allez to the douain. Means <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the hotel. Oh, certainly--we don't {{know the}} French language." ...|$|R
500|$|In an October 2013 {{interview}} with BBC 6Music, Jones confirmed that Strummer did have intentions of a Clash reunion {{and in fact}} new music was being written for a possible album. In the months prior to Strummer's death, Jones and Strummer began working on new music for what he thought {{would be the next}} Mescaleros album. Jones said [...] "We wrote a batch – we didn't use to write one, we used to write a batch at a time – like gumbo. The idea was <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the studio with the Mescaleros during the day and then send them all home. I'd come in all night and we'd all work all night." [...] Jones said months had passed following their work together when he ran into Strummer at an event. Jones was curious as to what would become of the songs he and Strummer were working on and Strummer informed him {{that they were going to}} be used for the next Clash album.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Brazilians' narrow 1–0 quarter-final {{win against}} Wales on June 19, 1958, Mel Hopkins (the fullback who faced him that game) {{described}} Garrincha as [...] "a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic. It {{was difficult to}} know which way <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> because of his legs {{and because he was}} as comfortable on his left foot as his right, so he could cut inside or go down the line and he had a ferocious shot too." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the A's {{got off to}} a 20–24 start (2 {{games out}} of first place) in 1984, Boros was fired in late May and {{replaced}} with first base coach Jackie Moore. The firing came hours after a team meeting in which Boros told the players that he would not change his personality. First baseman Bruce Bochte said, [...] "Steve indicated {{there was a lot of}} talk going around, that his situation wasn't stable. He said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ahead and be the kind of manager he had been, that he wasn't going to change to keep his job." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, {{he had it}} all mapped out. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> St. Paul {{first and}} then {{straight}} west to Seattle. From there <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Alaska." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{liked to}} flit out after him when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> church at night. If <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alone, <b>he</b> swung {{her over the}} wall, and let her come.|$|R
6000|$|No {{doubt she}} was right for all her thoughtlessness, and yet <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fight about that woman to-morrow! No--he forgot; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fight Captain Pinckney because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> like her! ...|$|R
60|$|After {{the party}} was all over, quite late, I went with Watersell for a swim in his private pool. Most {{remarkable}} thing I ever saw. He said everybody has Roman baths and Pompei baths and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> them one better, so he has an Egyptian bath, the pool itself {{like the inside of}} an ancient temple, long vista of great big green columns and a big idol at the end, and the pool all in green marble with lights underneath the water and among the columns, and the water itself just heat of air, so you can't tell where the water leaves off and the air above it begins, hardly, and feel as though you were swimming in air through a green twilight. Darndest sensation I ever felt, and the idol and columns sort of awe you.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} {{she was silent}} with rather sad downcast eyes. She was about to retort but {{something}} checked the words on her tongue. Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when {{it was simply a}} lovers' quarrel. As per usual somebody's nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn't go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.|$|E

60|$|Some {{critical}} spirit {{within him}} asked him urgently why <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the station, what <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing, what <b>he</b> {{thought he had}} done, and what <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do. To all of which questions Mr. Brumley perceived he had no adequate reply.|$|R
5000|$|Carter's {{first choice}} for college was the University of Tennessee not Michigan State University. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{there on a}} {{football}} scholarship but Carter concluded by saying [...] "I thought it over and concluded that I really felt more comfortable at Michigan State." ...|$|E

5000|$|Minutes later, {{a second}} attack occurred, in the {{predominantly}} Shia neighborhood of Al Kadhimiyah. Apparently aimed at {{an office of}} the Iraqi Federal Police and the National Security Ministry in Adan Square, it killed approximately 21 people and injured 71.

50|$|Indiana Governor Matthew E. Welsh {{recommended}} that new State Office Building Commission urge the Virginia Engineering Co., the building's general contractor, to send Rubin a letter postponing {{the creation of}} the sculpture. Welsh was an advocate of the art finances being used for the state's program for mentally handicapped. Rubin answered this letter by stating his continuation of the project and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ahead and draw up a contract with the architects. He already had a signed contract from the Virginia Engineering Co. after the former commission approved the expenditures for the statue and mural at $68,000.|$|E

50|$|Abby {{goes out}} with Nick. She can't walk, so the boy brings a wheel chair for her. They {{go to the}} harbour and they see Georgie and Tom, who came to Norfolk to visit his friend.

Ellie talks to Blake, who came back from Hong Kong (<b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Australia with Lucy, but he came back). He kisses her and tells Ellie that, he loves her.
