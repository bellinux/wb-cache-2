40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the crucial}} factors determining the {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) going to the privatized glass sector in the Czech Republic.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} fill these gaps. The choice of the glass sector allows for an analysis of a firm’s micro characteristics that attract foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investors</b> in an industrial sector, while reducing the impact of macroeconomic factors in their choice. Our econometrical analysis, using original panel data from 1990 to 2006, gives strong evidence that foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investors</b> in the glass sector in the Czech Republic have chosen larger and more profitable firms that were intensively restructured and privatized at the beginning of the transition.

This research employs time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) economic and political data, using ordinary least squares with panel corrected standard errors.

In this paper we study the perceptions of some Romanian foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investors</b> using an own investigation realized at more than a year from the adhesion.

We also took into consideration the main positive and negative aspects of the adhesion felt by the foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investors.</b> All these aspects were connected to the expectations the executives had before the adhesion. Although the sample we used is too small in order to allow generalizations, the results of our investigation may bring indices of the foreign direct investors’ perceptions about the Romanian business environment. ...|$|R
