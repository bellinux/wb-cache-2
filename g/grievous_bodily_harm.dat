5|$|Stuart {{carried on}} his captain duties for the 2008–09 season. In February 2008, he {{pleaded not guilty}} to the charges of <b>grievous</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>harm</b> to Chris Beardsley. He went on trial on 2 September 2008, denying the {{allegations}} of intent and insisted it was an accident, trying to release himself of Beardsley's hold. On 5 September 2008, the jury acquitted Stuart of the charges causing Beardsley <b>grievous</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>harm.</b>|$|E
5|$|Involuntary {{manslaughter}} {{involves the}} causing {{of the death}} of another person without intent to kill or intention to commit <b>grievous</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>harm.</b> Some cases are in form similar to murder cases; whilst, in others, had death not been caused, the defendant would only be liable for an insignificant crime.|$|E

5|$|The {{condition}} of foreign domestic workers is being increasingly scrutinised by human-rights groups and criticised as tantamount to modern slavery. Documented cases of worker abuse, including the successful prosecution of an employer for subjecting Erwiana Sulistyaningsih to <b>grievous</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>harm,</b> assault, criminal intimidation and unpaid wages, are increasing in number. In March 2016, an NGO, Justice Centre, reported its findings that one domestic worker in six in Hong Kong were deemed {{to have been}} forced into labour.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} trial, a further 26 {{defendants}} were still {{due to be}} tried on charges relating to the riot. The Crown Prosecution Service accepted plea bargains where defendants pleaded guilty to violent disorder {{in exchange for the}} dropping of other charges, or in some cases all charges were dropped completely. On 20 September 1993 the last remaining defendant to maintain a plea of not guilty went on trial, and he was convicted of conspiracy to commit <b>grievous</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>harm</b> and sentenced to thirty months imprisonment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{trial was}} started on 28 November 2012; it was {{announced}} on this first trial day that Jansen Steur was facing 21 criminal charges, including causing <b>grievous</b> <b>bodily</b> and mental <b>harm</b> through misdiagnoses of eight patients, causing one patient to commit suicide, theft, embezzlement and fraud. A total of 40 people filed charges against the doctor. Among these were charges by personal injury expert , who filed charges in name of a few dozen injured patients and in name of the families of three patients who died after having been treated by Jansen Steur. In addition to these charges, charges were filed of scientific fraud, after investigation by the Lemstra committee showed that Jansen Steur had falsified results in order to publish an article in The Lancet. [...] The court in Arnhem sentenced him for deliberately setting misdiagnosis, wrongly prescribing strong medicines and the denial of care. In addition he was considered responsible for a suicide of a female patient due to his diagnosis. The court sentenced in February 2014 3 years of prison. Jansen went into appeal.|$|R

2500|$|In British law, consent is an {{absolute}} defence to common assault, but not necessarily to actual <b>bodily</b> <b>harm,</b> where courts may decide that consent is not valid, as occurred {{in the case of}} R v Brown. Accordingly, consensual activities in the UK may not constitute [...] "assault occasioning actual or <b>grievous</b> <b>bodily</b> harm" [...] in law. The Spanner Trust states that this is defined as activities which have caused injury [...] "of a lasting nature" [...] but that only a slight duration or injury might be considered [...] "lasting" [...] in law. The decision contrasts with the later case of R v Wilson in which conviction for non-sexual consensual branding within a marriage was overturned, the appeal court ruling that R v Brown was not an authority in all cases of consensual injury and criticizing the decision to prosecute.|$|R
5|$|In October 2007, Stuart {{was held}} in custody by Essex Police on {{suspicion}} of assault, in relation to an incident involving Chris Beardsley which resulted in Beardsley's jaw being broken in two places. The incident occurred during a match with York City on 22 September 2007. He was charged with <b>grievous</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>harm</b> in December 2007. He made a further 43 appearances for Grays during the season, failing to score. Following the departure of Stuart Thurgood to Gillingham in November 2007, Stuart was handed the captaincy {{for the remainder of}} the season, having previous served as vice-captain.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, 2008, Amir Sanker and Eitan Gerella, two {{suspected}} {{associates of}} the Abergil crime family, were acquitted of {{a charge of}} <b>grievous</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>harm</b> by a Tel Aviv District Court, instead being convicted of lesser crimes, due to police negligence in collecting evidence. The charge sheet had claimed that the suspects had planned to kill Nissim Alperon, brother of crime boss Yaakov Alperon in retaliation for an attack on Itzhak Abergil said {{to be carried out}} by the Alperons five months earlier. On November 2008, Yaakov Alperon was killed in a car blast in Tel Aviv.|$|E
5|$|In Moscow, around 6,000 {{police were}} on duty {{to prevent a}} repeat of the 2008 UEFA Cup Final riots a week earlier, but police {{reported}} that none of the 40,000 visiting fans were arrested, due in part to public safety measures such as a ban on public drinking and no large screens being set up for members of the public to watch the game outdoors. In London, violence escalated outside Fulham Broadway tube station, near Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground; police arrested 12 people on public order offences, while one man was arrested for <b>grievous</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>harm,</b> drink driving and dangerous driving, after he hit a 31-year-old while attempting to drive down Fulham Broadway. Five police were also believed to have been injured in the incident.|$|E

50|$|Assault causing <b>bodily</b> <b>harm</b> is a {{statutory}} offence {{of assault}} in Canada with aggravating factors. It is committed by anyone who, in committing an assault, causes <b>bodily</b> <b>harm</b> to the complainant.

5|$|The ALP {{government}} {{lost the}} 2004 election, with the United Progressive Party under Baldwin Spencer taking 14 of the 17 seats in House. A year later, Bird was ousted as Chairman of the ALP {{and replaced by}} Molwyn Joseph. Following an unauthorised ALP march on May Day in 2009 to protest the Spencer government, Bird and six other senior ALP figures, including the former Prime Minister, were {{arrested and charged with}} public order offences. They pleaded not guilty, but were convicted and fined. This followed severe delays after Bird suffered a seizure during the trial, his third since 2008. Two more seizures occurred in 2010, the second on 11 March 2010 in court, where Bird was defending an individual accused of <b>grievous</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>harm.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Bodily</b> <b>harm</b> {{is defined}} as any hurt or injury to a person that interferes with the health or comfort of the person and {{that is more than}} merely {{transient}} or trifling in nature.

25|$|In August 2009, a {{game between}} Tranmere and Middlesbrough at the Billingham Synthonia ground caused controversy.

50|$|Intentional {{property}} damage {{may be considered}} a form of violence, albeit one usually (but not always) less reprehensible than violence which does <b>bodily</b> <b>harm</b> to other living beings. For example, allowing a pacemaker to fail or a well to become poisoned may qualify as both {{property damage}} and lead to <b>bodily</b> <b>harm.</b> On a similar note, certain forms of property damage may prevent <b>bodily</b> <b>harm,</b> such as breaking a piece of machinery {{that was about to}} injure a person. Some argue that property damage signals a willingness to do <b>bodily</b> <b>harm</b> or otherwise intimidates the free flow of communication in political or economic debates. Mohandas Gandhi was of this opinion, but nonetheless differentiated doing <b>bodily</b> <b>harm</b> from property damage, even if he thought both to be violence, which also he thought admissible in certain dire circumstances.|$|R
