30|$|The first {{subgroup}} of patients underwent simple laminectomy without fusion. To avoid nomenclature ambiguity, we term “laminectomy” a surgical procedure of spinosectomy, <b>flavectomy</b> and interspinosectomy with a bilateral complete sparing of the articular process. Discectomy and arthrectomy, {{as well as}} surgical fusion were never performed on the patients included in the study. Operative microscope was routinely employed. In case of foraminal stenosis, a foraminotomy was added to perform a nerve root decompression and appropriate adhesiolysis.|$|E
40|$|Ligamentum flavum cysts {{have rarely}} been {{reported}} and {{known to be}} the uncommon cause of spinal compression and radiculopathy. A 63 -year-old man presented right sciatica lasting for 1 month. Lumbar computerized tomography and mag-netic resonance imaging demonstrated an extradural cystic mass adjacent to the L 5 -S 1 facet joints. Partial hemilaminectomy and <b>flavectomy</b> at the L 5 -S 1 space were performed, and then the cystic mass was excised. Histopathology confirmed a connective tissue cyst, {{which is consistent with}} the ligamentum flavum. Microscopic examination of the cyst wall revealed that it is closely packed collagen fibril. The symptom of patient was improved after surgery. Because of rarity of ligamentum flavum cysts and nonspecific clinical and radiologic findings, the preoperative diagnosis is not easy. The histologic features of ligamentum flavum cysts are distinct from other cystic lesion of lumbar spine. This study presents a case and literature review of ligamentum flavum cyst. We summarize the pathophysiology, occurrence, differential diagnosis of rare ligamentum flavum cyst, especially on lumbar spine...|$|E

Object. We arranged a mini-invasive surgical approach for implantation of paddle electrodes for SCS under spinal anesthesia obtaining the best paddle electrode placement and minimizing patients ’ discomfort. We describe our technique supported by neurophysiological intraoperative monitoring and clinical results. Methods. 16 patients, affected by neuropathic pain underwent the implantation of paddle electrodes for spinal cord stimulation in lateral decubitus under spinal anesthesia. The paddle was introduced after <b>flavectomy</b> and each patient confirmed the correct distribution of paresthesias induced by intraoperative test stimulation. VAS and patients ’ satisfaction rate were recorded during the followup and compared to preoperative values. Results. No patients reported discomfort during the procedure. In all cases, paresthesias coverage of the total painful region was achieved, allowing the best final electrode positioning. At the last followup (mean 36. 7 months), 87. 5 % of the implanted patients had a good rate of satisfaction with a mean VAS score improvement of 70. 5 %. Conclusions. Spinal cord stimulation under spina...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Synovial cysts of the {{vertebral}} facet joints are {{a source}} of nerve root compression. Different surgical procedures are in use, but no consensus has been formed so far as to which method should be used in synovial cysts. To clarify the role of surgical management, the efficacy of operative procedures and factors influencing the outcome in our own series of 19 patients treated between 1994 and 1998 were analysed.  METHODS—Nineteen patients {{with a mean age of}} 65 years underwent surgery for medically intractable radicular pain or neurological deficits caused by synovial cysts. The patients' records were retrospectively analysed for neurological deficits, cysts diameter, operative approach, segmental hypermobility, and clinical outcome; CT and MRI were analysed for additional degenerative changes.  RESULTS—In 17 patients an excellent result and in two patients a good postoperative result was achieved. Twelve patients were found to have hypermobility of the facet joints and six had spondylolisthesis. There was no correlation between cyst diameter, operative approach, and outcome. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred.  CONCLUSIONS—Age and hypermobility may play a part in the aetiology of facet joint synovial cysts. As all operative strategies showed equally good clinical outcome, total excision via a small <b>flavectomy</b> as the least invasive approach should be considered therapy of choice in patients with cysts causing neurological deficits. ...|$|E

40|$|Study Design Experimental study. Objectives To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} stepwise resection of posterior spinal ligaments, facet joints, and ribs on thoracic spinal flexibility. Summary of Background Data Posterior spinal ligaments, facet joints and ribs are removed to increase spinal flexibility in corrective spinal surgery for deformities such as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Reported clinical results vary and biomechanical substantiation is lacking. Methods Ten fresh-frozen human cadaveric thoracic spinal specimens (T 6 -T 11) were studied. A spinal motion simulator applied a pure moment of ± 2. 5 Nm in flexion, extension, lateral bending (LB) and axial rotation (AR). Range of motion (ROM) was measured for the intact spine and measured again after stepwise resection of the supra/interspinous ligament (SIL), inferior facet, flaval ligament, superior facet, and rib heads. Results SIL resection increased ROM in flexion (10. 2 %) and AR (3. 1 %). Successive inferior facetectomy increased ROM in flexion (4. 1 %), LB (3. 8 %) and AR (7. 7 %), and <b>flavectomy</b> in flexion (9. 1 %) and AR (2. 5 %). Sequential superior facetectomy only increased ROM in flexion (6. 3 %). Rib removal provided an additional increase in flexion (6. 3 %), LB (4. 5 %) and AR (13. 0 %). Extension ROM increased by 10. 5 % after the combined removal of the SIL, inferior facet and flaval ligament. Conclusions Posterior spinal releases in these non-scoliotic spines led to an incremental increase in spinal flexibility, but each sequential step had less effect. As compared to SIL resection with inferior facetectomy, additional superior facetectomy did not improve flexibility in AR and LB and only 6. 3 % in flexion. The data presented from this in vitro study should be interpreted with care, as no representative cadaveric spine model for AIS was available, However, the results presented here at least question the benefits of performing routine complete facetectomies (i. e. Ponte osteotomies) to increase spinal flexibility in scoliosis surgery...|$|E
