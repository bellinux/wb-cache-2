40|$|Toe-in gait and crouch gait {{can make}} {{children}} with mild cerebral palsy fall and suffer improper balance during walking or ambulation training. A customized <b>external</b> <b>strap</b> orthosis for correcting leg alignment {{was used to}} resolve this problem. The {{purpose of this study}} was to research the immediate effects while wearing the customized <b>external</b> <b>strap</b> orthosis. Pressure platform was used to assess the plantar pressure through static and dynamic assessments and to record the changes in path of pressure trajectory. Motion image analysis system was used to record the gait parameters, which included gait speed, stride length, and cadence. The influence of both wearing and removing the orthosis on the dominant leg of children with mild cerebral palsy was analyzed. Nine children with mild cerebral palsy, who all had a dominant right leg, were recruited. After wearing the orthosis, all gait parameters improved, and foot motion changed in the stance phase of the gait cycle. The path of pressure trajectory closing to the midline was also observed during dynamic assessment. Changes in plantar pressure and path of pressure trajectory were observed and the orthosis device could provide immediate assistance to correct the leg alignment and improve the gait performance in children with mild cerebral palsy...|$|E

40|$|Objective. Impaired hip motion {{has been}} {{associated}} with heightened medial knee joint loading in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A hip <b>external</b> rotation <b>strap</b> designed to pull the femur into external rotation and abduction may serve as one protective mechanism. The primary aim of our study is to determine if the strap decreases medial knee joint loading during level walking in people with knee OA. Design. This study is a single-day repeated measures design. Methods. 15 volunteers with medial knee OA underwent motion analysis data collection during two randomly assigned walking conditions: (1) wearing the strap and (2) control (no strap). Primary outcome measures were peak pelvis, hip and knee joint motions, and torques. These outcomes were averaged across five trials for each condition. Results. Hip abduction (< 0. 01), trunk lean towards the stance limb (= 0. 04) and pelvic tilt (= 0. 02) significantly increased with the strap versus control trials. Knee adduction loading did not significantly change with the strap (= 0. 33). Conclusion. The use of the hip <b>external</b> rotation <b>strap</b> resulted in angular changes at the hip and pelvis which may be beneficial for patients with medial knee osteoarthritis...|$|R

40|$|Measurement of spinal motion using skin surface {{measurements}} {{is important}} in gaining {{a better understanding of}} the possible factors and risks associated with back pain in a variety situations and the development of effective rehabilitation and ergonomic programmes. In addition, this kind of system can enable activity monitoring outside the laboratory environment. However, skin surface measurements are prone to errors due to sensor misalignment and skin movement. In this study these two potential errors were being investigated using two electromagnetic tracking sensors. By using a hinged joint to study the effect of sensor misalignment, it was found that a 5 ˚ misalignment produced a measurement error of between 2. 6 ° and 5. 8 °. This error grew when the degree of misalignment increased. In the sensor attachment experiment, two participants were recruited and requested to perform six physiological movements with four different attachment methods. It was observed that insecure sensor attachment would also produce large artefacts (20. 1 ° to 23. 6 ° of coupled motions compared to 3. 3 °/ 3. 9 ° to 5. 8 °/ 5. 7 ° with secured attachment methods during flexion) during spinal motion measurements. In conclusion, ensuring secure sensor attachment and alignment using base plates and <b>external</b> <b>strapping</b> was found to minimise error due to skin movement and contraction of muscles, thus contributing to a more reliable and valid study in spinal motion measurement using external motion sensors...|$|R

Eight clinical scans were performed using a 1 -d 99 mTc-sestamibi pro-tocol while recording the respiratory signal. The list-mode capa-bility along with the strap or sensor signals was used to generate respiratory bin projection sets. A segmentation process was used to detect the shift between the respiratory bins. This shift was further projected to the acquired projection images for cor...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis: A shear {{retrofitting}} {{method for}} reinforced concrete (RC) beams {{has been developed}} that uses <b>external</b> CFRP <b>straps</b> to provide additional shear capacity. Research has been undertaken to develop an installation technique that allows the CFRP strap to encompass the full depth of the beam, without requiring access to the top surface of the beam. The current testing scheme investigates the durability of the CFRP strap system using the new installation technique. A long-term load test was conducted on a RC T-beam which indicated that the straps continued to provide shear capacity after 7 months under a load equivalent to 80 % of the ultimate capacity of the retrofitted beam. A cyclic test conducted on another similar T-beam specimen demonstrated that after 1, 000, 000 cycles, under a load that varied between 0. 5 and 0. 8 times the ultimate retrofitted beam capacity, the straps continued to provide effective shear enhancement...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of fiber}} {{reinforced}} polymers (FRPs) for the strengthening and repair of existing concrete structures {{is a field}} with tremendous potential. The materials are very durable and hence ideally suited for use as external reinforcement. Although extensive work {{has been carried out}} investigating the use of FRPs for flexural strengthening (e. g. Meier et al., 1992) a fairly recent development is the use of these materials for the shear strength enhancement of concrete. The current system investigates the use of post-tensioned non-laminated carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) <b>straps</b> as <b>external</b> shear reinforcement for concrete. Experiments were carried out on an unstrengthened control beam and beams strengthened with <b>external</b> CFRP <b>straps.</b> It was found that the ultimate load capacity of the strengthened beams was significantly higher than that of the control specimen. Existing design codes and analysis methods were found to underestimate the ultimate resistance of the control specimen and the strengthened beams. Nevertheless, the modified compression field theory provided insight into possible failure mechanisms and the influence of the strap prestress level on the structural behaviour. It is concluded that the use of these novel stressed elements could represent a viable and durable means of strengthening existing concrete infrastructure...|$|R

He worked on development of this design for use as an indwelling urinary catheter, to provide continuous drainage of the bladder, in the 1930s. His design incorporated an inflatable balloon towards the tip of the tube which could be inflated inside the bladder to retain the catheter without <b>external</b> taping or <b>strapping.</b> He demonstrated this to the American Urologists Society in 1935, and published a paper describing it in 1937.While he was still developing his catheter, a patent was issued to Paul Raiche of the Davol Rubber Company of Providence, Rhode Island in 1936. Four months later, in October 1936, Foley applied for the patent, and was awarded this after appearing before the patent office Board of Appeals. Raiche appealed this decision in court, and it was overturned, returning the patent to Raiche. A further request for a hearing made by Foley was refused, and so the patent stayed with Raiche.|$|R
