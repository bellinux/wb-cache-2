500|$|Masterworks Broadway {{released}} {{a recording of}} the 1967 Lincoln Center production starring Florence Henderson as Nellie, Giorgio Tozzi as Emile, Justin McDonough as Cable and Irene Byatt as Bloody Mary. [...] The recording includes a version of [...] "Bali Ha'i", sung in French by Eleanor Calbes, the Liat. [...] According to Kenrick, [...] "Every track of this 1967 Lincoln Center cast recording is such a winner that you can't <b>help</b> <b>wondering</b> why {{it took so long}} for this winner to make its way to CD." [...] Kenrick notes that the album is a more complete alternative to the original cast album.|$|E
500|$|According to Metcalfe, Mercedes did {{not want}} to have an affair and was not [...] "looking for someone else", stating, [...] "Malachy's been working hard to provide for them and he hasn’t {{had a lot of time}} for her". Turning to Calvin, she confided in him and they kiss. Whittle added that the affair had become more serious and their {{chemistry}} was [...] "more than just physical". Also according to Metcalfe, [...] "Every three months Mercedes has to have an HIV test and, yes, it is making her resent Malachy a bit. She can’t <b>help</b> <b>wondering</b> what it would be like to be with someone like Calvin who isn't HIV positive", even though she felt [...] "guilty". When Mercedes learned that she has to be retested for HIV, she feared that the test would be positive. Initially, she did not tell Malachy about it, but eventually [...] "snaps" [...] at him, telling him she [...] "won't forgive him" [...] if she has contracted HIV. The test was negative which was a [...] "huge relief" [...] for them.|$|E
500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle {{gave the}} program a rave review and saying that, [...] " [...] good you can't <b>help</b> <b>wondering</b> {{why no one}} thought of it before, a {{compelling}} mix of credible real-life melodrama with a fictionalized approximation {{of what it takes}} to get a Broadway show from the idea stage to opening night. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "Unless you're allergic to musicals in general and Broadway in particular, you should find that a compelling central story, a strong cast, an out-of-the-procedural-mold premise and some rousing, roof-raising numbers more than compensate for any lingering problems." [...] He ultimately gave it three and a half stars out of four. The A.V. Club reviewer Noel Murray praised the cast and Eileen's divorce storyline. He mainly criticized the staging and arrangement of the musical numbers saying they threatened the realism of the show and wrote they weren't completely [...] "digetic". He ultimately gave the episode a B. Another A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff criticized the series for not avoiding clichés but also wrote [...] "the show is so damned sincere about how much it embraces the clichés of the backstage Broadway story that those inclined to like this sort of thing—and I'm very much one of them—will forgive it some of these excesses." [...] He also criticized the adoption storyline. Despite this, he went on to compare the series to Hill Street Blues, ER and The West Wing.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{critics who}} {{accepted}} {{the premise of}} the show and the legitimacy of motorcycles under the Guggenheim's roof, since museums have included design exhibitions before, and shown, for example, utilitarian bowls or ancient chariots as art, many still had misgivings about {{the way in which it}} was financed. While appreciative of Thomas Krens' innovative museum direction, The New York Times mused that, [...] "one can't <b>help</b> <b>wondering</b> which came first, the idea for the exhibition or the realization that money [...] would be available for such a show." [...] A number of times the Guggenheim answered critics of BMW's involvement by ticking off the total number of Harley-Davidsons and Hondas, which were greater than BMWs included. [...] But it was suggested that even at that, there were BMWs shown that were not significant enough to be present.|$|E
2500|$|In my {{own case}} {{the words of}} such an act as the Income Tax... merely dance before my eyes in a {{meaningless}} procession: cross-reference to cross-reference, exception upon exception—couched in abstract terms that offer [...] no handle to seize hold of [...] leave in my mind only a confused sense of some vitally important, but successfully concealed, purport, which it is my duty to extract, but which is within my power, if at all, only after the most inordinate expenditure of time. I know that these monsters {{are the result of}} fabulous industry and ingenuity, plugging up this hole and casting out that net, against all possible evasion; yet at times I cannot help recalling a saying of William James about certain passages of Hegel: that they were no doubt written with a passion of rationality; but that one cannot <b>help</b> <b>wondering</b> whether to the reader they have any significance save that the words are strung together with syntactical correctness.|$|E
