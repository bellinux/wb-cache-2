40|$|Steel {{companies}} {{in many areas}} of the country have found it increasingly difficult to attract talented recent graduates of college and university engineering and applied science programs to the <b>Electric</b> Arc <b>Furnace</b> <b>iron</b> & steel industry. College student involvement in co-operative programs at steel companies can attract needed talent to the industry. Additionally, certain R & D needs identified in the Steel Industry Technology Roadmap are addressed as co-operative program activities. The Steel Manufacturers Association (''SMA'') therefore established a co-operative education program for selected college students who have completed the first or second year of a four or five-year college program, to be recognized as SMA Co-Operative Fellows, in regard to their summer and fall semester projects with SMA's member companies...|$|R

40|$|Unintentionally {{produced}} persistent {{organic pollutants}} (UP-POPs) including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) were characterized and quantified in stack gas and fly ash from the second ventilation systems in five typical converters in five different steelmaking plants. The 2378 -substituted PCDD/Fs (2378 -PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like PCB (dl-PCBs) toxic equivalents (TEQs) were 1. 84 - 10. 3 pg WHO-TEQ Nm(- 3) in the stack gas and 5. 59 - 87. 6 pg WHO-TEQ g(- 1) in the fly ash, and the PCN TEQs were 0. 06 - 0. 56 pg TEQ Nm(- 3) in the stack gas and 0. 03 - 0. 08 pg TEQ g(- 1) in the fly ash. The concentrations of UP-POPs {{in the present study}} were generally lower than those in other metallurgical processes, such as <b>electric</b> arc <b>furnaces,</b> <b>iron</b> ore sintering, and secondary metallurgical processes. Adding scrap metal might increase UP-POP emissions, indicating that raw material composition was a key influence on emissions. HxCDF, HpCDF, OCDF, HpCDD, and OCDD were the dominant PCDD/Fs in the stack gas and fly ash. TeCB and PeCB were dominant in the stack gas, but HxCB provided more to the total PCB concentrations in the fly ash. The lower chlorinated PCNs were dominant in all of the samples. The 2378 -PCDD/F, dl-PCB, and PCN emission factors in stack gases from the steelmaking converter processes (per ton of steel produced) were 1. 88 - 2. 89, 0. 14 - 0. 76 (,) and 229 - 759 mu g t(- 1), respectively...|$|R
40|$|Polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs) and polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{were characterized}} and quantified in stack gas from secondary ventilation systems from five different steelmaking plants. The concentrations of 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted PBDD/Fs (2, 3, 7, 8 -PBDD/Fs) and PBDEs were 0. 036 – 0. 19 ng/Nm 3 (0. 32 – 4. 33 pg toxic equivalency (TEQ) /Nm 3) and 3. 11 – 40. 0 ng/Nm 3, respectively, in the stack gas. These concentrations {{were lower than}} those in other metallurgical processes, such as <b>electric</b> arc <b>furnaces</b> and <b>iron</b> ore sintering processes. The concentrations of PBDEs were 26 – 94 times {{higher than those of}} PBDD/Fs in the stack gas. The PBDD/F and PBDE emission factors in the stack gas from the steelmaking converter processes (per tonne of steel produced) were 0. 048 – 0. 59 µg/t (0. 66 – 20. 8 ng TEQ/t) and 6. 36 – 76. 6 µg/t, respectively. These data are helpful for establishing an emission inventory of PBDD/Fs from the converter steelmaking industry in China...|$|R
