40|$|Black-grass (Alopecurus myosuroides, Huds.) is {{the most}} {{important}} herbicide-resistant weed in Europe. In Germany it is not only a problem in the maritime influenced areas like Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony anymore, as well in other regions black-grass develops to the most important weed in winter wheat and oilseed rape. There are multifaceted reasons for that, one reason are close winter crop rotations and early sowing dates which are economically very attractive for the farmers, another one are <b>herbicide</b> <b>resistances.</b> Black-grass germinates in autumn and in spring, but the main germination period is from late August to early October. If winter wheat is sown early in autumn, the main germination is in parallel to the wheat. Then the weeds can only be managed by culture specific herbicides. The pressure on the herbicides is therefore increasing. <b>Herbicide</b> <b>resistances</b> can be the result. As long as very effective herbicides are available, so that farmers are not dependent on weed biology and plant production weed management measures such as sowing date. Late sowing dates can reduce the black-grass populations, but this option is not attractive to many farmers in Schleswig-Holstein. In mind of the farmers the risk of delayed sowing dates in autumn is too high, because increased rainfall such as can make it difficult to marsh soils sowing, or make impossible. Objective of this trial was the germination of Black-grass to show to two sowing dates. The results of the field trial show, that black-grass populations can be reduced if winter wheat is sown later in autumn...|$|R

25|$|Agrobacterium-mediated {{transformation}} {{is the easiest}} and most simple plant transformation. Plant tissue (often leaves) are cut into small pieces, e.g. 10x10mm, and soaked for 10 minutes in a fluid containing suspended Agrobacterium. The bacteria will attach {{to many of the}} plant cells exposed by the cut. The plant cells secrete wound-related phenolic compounds which in turn act to upregulate the virulence operon of the Agrobacterium. The virulence operon includes many genes that encode for proteins that are part of a Type IV secretion system that exports from the bacterium proteins and DNA (delineated by specific recognition motifs called border sequences and excised as a single strand from the virulence plasmid) into the plant cell through a structure called a pilus. The transferred DNA (called T-DNA) is piloted to the plant cell nucleus by nuclear localization signals present in the Agrobacterium protein VirD2, which is covalently attached {{to the end of the}} T-DNA at the Right border (RB). Exactly how the T-DNA is integrated into the host plant genomic DNA is an active area of plant biology research. Assuming that a selection marker (such as an antibiotic resistance gene) was included in the T-DNA, the transformed plant tissue can be cultured on selective media to produce shoots. The shoots are then transferred to a different medium to promote root formation. Once roots begin to grow from the transgenic shoot, the plants can be transferred to soil to complete a normal life cycle (make seeds). The seeds from this first plant (called the T1, for first transgenic generation) can be planted on a selective (containing an antibiotic), or if an <b>herbicide</b> <b>resistance</b> gene was used, could alternatively be planted in soil, then later treated with herbicide to kill wildtype segregants. Some plants species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana can be transformed by dipping the flowers or whole plant, into a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, typically strain C58 (C=Cherry, 58=1958, the year in which this particular strain of A. tumefaciens was isolated from a cherry tree in an orchard at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York). Though many plants remain recalcitrant to transformation by this method, research is ongoing that continues to add to the list the species that have been successfully modified in this manner.|$|E

40|$|Phosphinothricin (PPT) is {{the active}} {{component}} {{of a family of}} environmentally safe, nonselective <b>herbicides.</b> <b>Resistance</b> to PPT in transgenic crops has been reported by nuclear expression of a bar transgene encoding phosphinothricin acetyltransferase, a detoxifying enzyme. We report here expression of a bacterial bar gene (b-bar 1) in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Petit Havana) plastids that confers field-level tolerance to Liberty, an herbicide containing PPT. We also describe a second bacterial bar gene (b-bar 2) and a codon-optimized synthetic bar (s-bar) gene with significantly elevated levels of expression in plastids (> 7 % of total soluble cellular protein). Although these genes are expressed at a high level, direct selection thus far did not yield transplastomic clones, indicating that subcellular localization rather than the absolute amount of the enzyme is critical for direct selection of transgenic clones. The codon-modified s-bar gene is poorly expressed in Escherichia coli, a common enteric bacterium, due to differences in codon use. We propose to use codon usage differences as a precautionary measure to prevent expression of marker genes in the unlikely event of horizontal gene transfer from plastids to bacteria. Localization of the bar gene in the plastid genome is an attractive alternative to incorporation in the nuclear genome since there is no transmission of plastid-encoded genes via pollen...|$|R

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{provides an}} overview of the issue of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). I chose this topic because its importance is currently increasing as GMOs and their products are becoming inherent part of our lives. The areas sown with GM crops increase in the world every year and GM products are also imported to the Czech Republic. In the literature research are described methods used to insert foreign DNA into plant cells. Especially common is transformation via bacteria strain Agrobacterium using so called microprojectiles. Most often used transgenes cause the plant to gain new properties, such as tolerance to <b>herbicides,</b> <b>resistance</b> to insect pests, tolerance to stress etc. There follows a summary of the legislative conditions and the concept of coexistence in the Czech Republic, which every grower, who decides to grow GM crops, should follow. In Europe only two GM crops are allowed for commercial cultivation, Bt corn and GM potatoes. In 2010 The Czech Republic became the only European country where both the allowed crops were grown. In the thesis is also summarised existing knowledge of GM crops cultivation in the world. Finally, we evaluate potential risks associated with GM crops cultivation. Significant role in the risk assessment plays also the impact of GMO cultivation on target and nontarget organisms. We also discuss the possibilities and prospects of their cultivation in our country and in the world. The aim of the thesis is to help the readers, professional or not, understand the issue so they can form their own opinion...|$|R

40|$|Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) engenders {{special concern}} {{regarding}} gene flow, {{due to its}} potential for outcrossing, for volunteer emergence and to form temporary feral populations. If different genetically engineered (GE) herbicide-resistant oilseed rape cultivars are grown in neighboring fields, seeds and subsequent volunteers with multiple <b>herbicide</b> <b>resistances</b> (HR) can arise. 1 If multiple resistant volunteer plants are not removed, e. g., by using an appropriate herbicide, they {{can serve as a}} source or sink for further cross-pollination. 2 In addition to potential problems with multiple resistant volunteers following crop rotations, the combination (´stacking`) of different GE traits in one plant may affect HR gene expression and thereby the reliability of expression-based transgene detection. In a recent paper, 3 we presented the results of a biennial large-scale field experiment with two different GE oilseed rape lines cultivated on adjacent plots to investigate the frequencies of HR gene dispersal, the expression of HR genes in double-resistant plants, and the sensitivity of plants to conventional herbicides.

40|$|The {{development}} of the DNA recombinant technology has provided the transfer of a single or several genes within or among species whereby organisms with new traits were developed. Such organisms have been called genetically modified organisms. The first genetically modified varieties of cultivated plants entered the market in 1996 and since then areas sown with such crops has been increasing, amounting to 60 M ha in 2002. During the stated period, genetically modified varieties and hybrids of cultivated plants were developed with a gene introduced for tolerance to <b>herbicides,</b> <b>resistance</b> to insects, prolonged maturity period and improved quality. However, heavy disputes have arisen {{all over the world}} relating the possible gain and potential risks from the growth and utilization of modified crops. First of all, there are ethical issues related directly to gene transfer from a species to a species, then effects of the introduced gene on the environment and human health, economical justification of cultivating genetically modified crops, consumers confidence in the legislation, labeling the products encompassing a genetic modification, effects on the global market and ever increasing food requirements. The effect of products derived from genetically modified plants on human health depends on a specific content of a product itself and can potentially be useful if a product contains an increased content of vitamins, with an allergen removed, or potentially harmful, if a new allergen or a toxin were introduced by genetic modifications. Each genetically modified product is subjected to a rigorous testing of its safety prior to its introduction into a food chain. It encompasses molecular, biochemical, toxicological, nutritional and allergenic tests. Many countries apply legislation that stipulates labeling of genetically modified products, whereby the fact that the commodity encompasses products of genetic modification is clearly pointed out. ...|$|R
