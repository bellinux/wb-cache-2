40|$|The {{short answer}} {{is to take a}} nap and dream about something. Our dreams are full of originality. Their {{elements}} are all old things, our memories of the past, but the combinations are original. Combinations make up in variety what they lack in quality, <b>as</b> when <b>we</b> dream about Socrates driving a bus in Brooklyn and talking to Joan of Arc about baseball. Our dreams get time, place, and people all mixed up. Awake, we have a stream of consciousness, also containing a lot of mistakes. But we can quickly correct those mistakes, usually before <b>speaking</b> out loud. <b>We</b> can improve the sentence, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> are <b>speaking</b> it. Indeed, most of the sentences <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> are ones we've never <b>spoken</b> before. <b>We</b> construct them on the spot. But how do we do it, when we say something we've never said before - and it doesn't come out as garbled <b>as</b> our dreams? <b>We</b> also forecast the future in a way that no other animal can do. Since it hasn't happened yet, we have to imagine what might happen. We often preempt the future by taking actions to head off what will otherwise happen. We can think before acting, guessing how objects or people might react to a proposed course of action. That is extraordinary when compared to all other animals. It even takes time to develop in children. By the time a child goes to school, adults start expecting them to be responsible for predicting the consequences: "You should have realized that [...] . " and "Think before you do something like that!" aren't seriously said to babies and most preschoolers - or our pets. We don't seriously expect our dogs and cats to appraise a novel situation, like a fish falling out of the refrigerator, with an eye toward saving it for the dinner guests tonight...|$|R

50|$|Joe Btfsplk is {{to blame}} for this whole thing. Joe was the dismal source of woe and {{depression}} who slunk through Lil Abners Dogpatch, spreading misery in every direction. I was a novice reference librarian at the University of Southern California (USC) in 1992, and pretty cocky about my research abilities when a lady called, wanting to know how to spell Joes last name. No problem, I thought. Joes spelling took several hours to track down, however, {{and in the course of}} that long, dusty (eventually successful) hunt I realized that no substantive index of comic strips and characters existed, either at USC or anywhere else. USCs library held two well-known encyclopedias on comics but nothing like the exhaustive indexes available in other areas of the humanities. Properly intimidated at the time by the publish-or-perish world of the untenured faculty librarian, I thought that such an index, a compilation of all comic strips ever published in the United States, and their major characters (to assist the next librarian who needed to spell Btfsplk) might make an interesting and academically acceptable publication, not to mention that it would chink up a gap in the reference literature. I was, however, pragmatical enough to realize that a work of this comprehensivity would pretty much take the rest of my life. That project continues on <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>speak,</b> with USC and tenure concerns long forgotten, and is beyond the scope of this work. Give me a few more years.|$|E
5000|$|The label's {{momentum}} slowed {{in the mid}} 80’s, {{as during}} this period Jennings was concentrating more on his 100% Mambo clothing company as he phased himself out of Phantom, and Normington was concentrating on making sure the Phantom shop stocked the absolute best records and music mags (from every conceivable country) that fell under the punk/alternative/indie banner, making return trips overseas to acquire stock, scouring many a dusty store for hidden gems which he then shipped back to Sydney, until 1987 when Normington threw himself back into the Phantom label with renewed vigour - this was justified {{by the success of}} The Hummingbirds, The Sparklers, The Deadly Hume, The Mark of Cain, <b>Even</b> <b>As</b> <b>We</b> <b>Speak</b> and Vanilla Chainsaws. In the late 80's, Normington decided to form a small new label called Messiah Complex (after an accusation a friend of his had made about him while on a train in Russia a couple of years before), initially devoted to releasing [...] "crushing and fierce garage-punk and grunge 45's only", headed by an evil fictional ego-driven character by the name of Dexter Baxter, who was sued by Waterfront Records management after unleashing defamatory remarks about them (and many others) in his very first press-release (to announce the label's existence). It's a great read. Messiah Complex released exclusive vinyl by Big Chief (their 3rd ever 7"), Superchunk (also their 3rd ever 7"), Canberra's Stooges fanatics Mudrac, ferocious Texan grunge-merchants Sugar Shack (their first 12" [...] record), and displaced NZ punks Casualty, plus a couple of CDs by Sydney punks Downtime.|$|E

40|$|We re-evaluate {{a medieval}} sophism {{concerning}} parts, wholes and identity. A reasonable {{analysis of this}} sophism is possible if we recognize that the adverb still has a non-temporal use. In his 13 th century treatise on syncategorematic words, William of Sherwood considered the following problem with parts and wholes 1 : Suppose Socrates is an animal. (Animal should be construed broadly enough here to include people.) Now, cut off his foot. What is left is still an ani-mal. Thus, all of Socrates is an animal, and all of him but his foot is also an ani-mal. But then it seems that one animal contains another as a proper part. By this logic, we all have numerous animals inside of us. No doubt this seems a reasonable conclusion to some people, who feel them stirring <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>speak.</b> But most people, I suspect, will agree with William of Sherwood {{that there is something}} wrong with this argument.

40|$|How may the {{inherent}} {{abilities of the}} designer {{contribute to the development}} of systemic design? This presentation will be a rhetoric monologue that will discuss some of the ideas and approaches known in design over a long period of time. It will discuss these in relation to the emerging concept of systemic design. Earlier attempts to integrate systems thinking in design have largely failed. Explanations for this failure have been arguments about systems approaches being alien to designerly ways, or the systems approaches have been too inflexible and dogmatic and the seamless integration into designing has failed. But there might be other additional reasons that so far have been largely overlooked. I will argue that design over time has developed a series of concepts in dealing with complex issues and to generate holistic resolutions. Some of these ideas and concepts are so basic and embedded in the designerly DNA that this might explain why they have not been looked at closer in this discussion. Systemic approaches have faced a resistance when entering the fields of design not only because they misfit but also because they had to compete with already embedded and integrated approaches and concepts. The radical potential of systemic design is that it might create new ways of relating design and systems thinking and hence also these inherent designerly concepts. Understanding {{the inherent}} ideas and concepts in regard to systemic design will shed more light on the problems systems thinking has faced regarding the design field. I propose that these designerly concepts to deal with complexity and create holistic solutions are the core of what design brings to systems thinking. One of the central features of the designer is the ability to create harmonic wholes. Confronted with many demands, briefs, complexities the designer aims at generating one holistic response that solves some or many of the contradictory inputs in the shape of a more or less esthetically beautiful and elegant form. In resent debates in design research this ability to design has been regarded as less important compared to the effort to move design closer to scientific research. If this shift comes at the cost of the mentioned central ability it will be catastrophic on several levels. First this designerly ability is truly the hallmark of design work and it is a genuinely specific activity that is particular to designers. We might find seemingly similar activities in other neighbouring fields like art and engineering, but none of them have the complete and versatile version as found in design. There is a danger that abandoning this root competence will destroy design. The core competence of composing holistic solutions will erode and we will see lesser solutions. <b>Even</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> discussing beauty, elegance and aesthetics in the context of systems thinking seems problematic...|$|E
