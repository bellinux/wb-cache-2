40|$|It was of {{importance}} {{in the evaluation of}} feedingstufrs to know its quantitative composition. A qualitative botanical indicated purity but a quantitative test was needed for the degree of purity. Natural feedstuffs always contained a certain amount of foreign material, which could be considered either as natural or chance contamination. The manufacturer had to ensure that commercial feedstuffs had a high degree of purity. Whenever there was consideration in the trade of standards for purity, it was necessary to be able to check these standards. Ezendam worked out a method of measuring impurities both quantitatively and qualitatively. It was tested on some feedstuffs and thus led the way for microscopic study <b>of</b> <b>feedingstuffs...</b>|$|R

In all feed and feed material samples which contained mammalian and fish origin PAP positive results by microscopic and FeedCheck methods were obtained. It should be pointed out that although fish meal is classified as PAP, the producer of the test did not declare this material as detectable by the FeedCheck test.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to present the results of {{comparative}} evaluation of the usefulness of PCR and microscopic methods for the detection of Processed Animal Protein (PAP) in feedingstuffs. In the validation study, the limit of the detection for PCR was determined on 0. 05 % for beef, 0. 1 % for pork and 0. 2 % for poultry meat and bone meal (MBM). Among 62 doubtful samples <b>of</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> examined by microscopic method 41 (66. 13 %) were found as positive. Based on the results obtained with the use of the microscopic and PCR methods it is possible to state that the molecular biology methods can, at present, be used as a supplementary method in PAP detection.

40|$|Intensification of milk {{production}} {{is associated with}} {{an increase in the number}} of dairy cows and milk yielding. In order to maintain high milk yield and quality of the produced raw material it is very important to adjust the appropriately balanced dose of feeds. Production of good quality own roughage is a valuable and cheap source of food for animals, but it may be insufficient to provide high milk yielding. As a result, it is necessary to buy commercial concentrated feedingstuffs (mainly protein concentrates and concentrated compounds) which may lead to an increase of production costs. Intensification of {{milk production}} in the economic aspect is justified only in the case of a simultaneous increase in the profitability of this production, which is the relation of the production value and incurred costs. For the economic purpose of milk production the way of feeding the dairy cows should also result from economic calculation and the purchase <b>of</b> commercial <b>feedingstuffs</b> must be economically justified. This article attempts to answer the question whether the increased consumption <b>of</b> commercial concentrated <b>feedingstuffs</b> and increased direct costs are justified by achieved economic results from milk production. The accountancy data were collected according to the methodology of the AGROKOSZTY and Polish FADN system among dairy farms. Grouping of the surveyed farms concerned a level <b>of</b> commercial <b>feedingstuff</b> quantity which (as shown by statistical analysis) was strongly correlated with milk yielding. The designated groups (with small level and high level of usage <b>of</b> commercial <b>feedingstuffs)</b> were analysed in terms of direct costs and labour input as well as the level of income from the activity. The economic results of the surveyed farms showed that the higher costs incurred for the purchase of commercial feedstuffs in the group with high usage <b>of</b> commercial <b>feedingstuffs</b> (average herd in the group was 30 dairy cows with milk yielding of 6, 000 liters per cow) did not allow to achieve much better economic results than in the group with small usage of commercial feedstuffs (average herd in group was 15 cows with milk yielding of 5, 200 litres per cow) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{experiments}} {{were made with}} adult White Leghorn cockerels to study the passage of feed residues through the alimentary canal. The birds were starved for 24 hr and then force-fed known quantities <b>of</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> Excreta were collected quantitatively at 2 hr intervals during the light periods, dried, and weighed. In the first two experiments the birds received 12 hr of light daily while in the third experiment continuous light was used. Residues of oats fed at levels ranging from 6 to 30 g/bird appeared in the excreta within 2 hr and continued to be voided for 52 hr. The rate and duration of residue output were functions of residue input; this was true for, wheat, fish meal, and dehydrated alfalfa as well as oats. For practi-cal purposes the clearance times were substantially less than 52 hr {{for most of the}} inputs studied.

40|$|The {{possibility}} to use NIR scanning microscopy {{for the detection}} of bone fragments in feedingstuffs has been evaluated analysing sediments derived from commercial feedingstuffs samples spiked with MBM. The method appeared sensitive enough to reveal the presence of bone fragments for MBM concentration in the feedingstuffs as low as 0. 05 wt. %. The identiﬁcation of MBM is done versus vegetable ingredients. The validation test, performed on a series <b>of</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> spiked at a 0. 1 wt. % MBM level (the detection limit reached by the ofﬁcial EU method based on optical microscopy), indicated that sensitivity (100 %) and speciﬁcity (96. 30 %) of the investigated method are satisfactory for possible applications in screening procedure. NIR microscopy analyses turned out to be reliable and fast (including a minimal operational time for the analyst) with the additional {{possibility to}} obtain a map of the sediment, with indicated the positions of bone fragments, that then could be selectively re-analyzed by NIR spectroscopy for conﬁrmation...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores a class <b>of</b> firms: the <b>intermediaries</b> <b>of</b> {{personal}} information. In {{the economics}} of personal information, scarcity {{is no longer the}} only, and foremost, determinant of value. The most important determinant of value becomes connection. Adapting what Gervais claims to be the first law of an information-flooded cloud-modelled economy, value is not derived from scarcity but rather from the fact that those who value it most will find it. Personal information is the raw material to create connections. Intermediaries collect personal information in exchange for goods or services, regardless of whether they actually need that information to perform their main activity, and use this information to connect other goods and services with the users who value them most, e. g. via personalisation or targeted advertising. Many firms in many different sectors are, or could become, <b>intermediaries</b> <b>of</b> personal information, from Google to supermarkets, from telecom operators to insurance companies. The descriptive analysis of this industry has consequences in terms of business model and regulatory approach. As for the former, it is worth exploring the conditions for which a firm could profitably become an <b>intermediary</b> <b>of</b> personal information and thereby exploit untapped resources for revenue generation. As for the latter, an imperfect understanding of {{the economics of}} personal information creates the risk for misaligned norms, and therefore for an uneven competition...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} analyses {{the stakes}} of activation {{policies in the}} French-speaking part of Belgium. It focuses on the private <b>intermediaries</b> <b>of</b> the labour market in "public-private partnership" with Belgian public employment services. It examines intermediaries‘work in devising and implementing employment policies and more precisely a particular activation measure called the job seeker’s support. This measure intends to improve job seekers’ socio-professional reinsertion by reducing exclusion and encouraging the return to employment. The sociological analysis of this activation measure relies on in-depth analyses of four categories <b>of</b> private <b>intermediaries</b> mandated by Belgian public employment services to support job seekers towards employment. The analyses {{are based on a}} qualitative and empirical research combining direct observations (N= 254), semi-structured interviews and documentary analyses (N= 29). Theoretically, they rely on the sociology of public action. This contribution demonstrates that, despite organisational contingencies and the discretionary power of the involved actors in implementing employment policies, the work <b>of</b> the private <b>intermediaries</b> <b>of</b> the labour market participates in increasing the standardisation of public action. This standardisation represents the transformation of knowledge that is enacted through interaction between job seekers’ and practitioners, private <b>intermediaries</b> <b>of</b> the labour market. This one inscribes and standardises knowledge into norms, figures and instruments (such as reporting, dashboards). This process, from enacted to inscribed knowledge, embodies institutional pressures in supporting job seekers and relies on new modes of delivery and implementation employment policies...|$|R
