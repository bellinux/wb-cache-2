We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E

500|$|On 20 August 2009, Villa {{scored in}} his first {{official}} match of the season, a 3–0 Europa League qualifier against Stabæk. He followed this up with two goals against Real Valladolid on 13 September, Villa's first league goals of the 2009–10 season. He scored twice more a week later against former club Sporting Gijón in a 2–2 draw at the Mestalla, where he also performed duties as the team's captain. After the match, Villa hinted towards being unhappy with Unai Emery's managerial decisions, stating, [...] "The approach {{for the second half}} was not right. We relaxed and ended up with the same result as last year. What has happened, has happened, but their goalkeeper was good, unlike our approach, which was not good," [...] however a day later he denied being critical of Emery, pointing out that, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> the approach, I was referring to the whole team, I spoke {{in the heat of the}} moment, I was annoyed at the way we lost two points and I said what I thought, but I have clarified everything that needed to be cleared up." ...|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{was drafted}} by the Baltimore Orioles {{in the second round}} of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall. Despite a story written by SABR, Ripken was {{selected}} with the Orioles' predetermined draft pick, not through a forfeited pick from the Boston Red Sox after the Sox selected Dick Drago in the 1977 re-entry draft. The Orioles would select catcher Cecil Whitehead with the pick they received from Boston two picks after Ripken. On deciding to go straight from high school to the professional level, he said, [...] "When the colleges started coming around, Dad and <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> mostly whether I was going to pursue a career in baseball. If I had the ability, the feeling was to get on with it, and if it didn't work out, start over again in college at 25 or 26." [...] Ripken played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability. The Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding it would be easier for him to transition back to pitching if necessary than it would be for him to start hitting again.|$|E
500|$|During summer 2001, Black Isle Studios {{employed}} three development teams. These {{included the}} Icewind Dale team, the team developing Torn, {{and a team}} working on an unannounced project. Before and during Torns development, several members of its team expressed interest in developing another game using the Infinity Engine. The development team was not made aware of Black Isle Studios' decision to develop Icewind Dale II until Torns cancellation. Lead designer J. E. Sawyer described, [...] "I don't know when the producers {{decided to make the}} game, but I was told that we were making the game when I learned that TORN was being cancelled ... on a Wednesday afternoon", and that Feargus Urquhart [...] "asked me to work with Steve Bokkes to create a story and area overview by Thursday afternoon. Steve and <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> {{it for the rest of}} the day. I went home that night and worked on the overviews until the next day. I came in and turned the docs in, and after the Friday division meeting, the project was in development." [...] During this period, Interplay Entertainment relied on Black Isle Studios' games to alleviate financial trouble, which put pressure to release games quickly. The decision to develop Icewind Dale II was based partly on the original Icewind Dales reception, and the development teams' ability to create a game with the Infinity Engine relatively quickly. Sawyer said of the decision, [...] "In all honesty, the reasons for making Icewind Dale II have to do with limiting risks and maximizing our chances for a popular title." [...] Conceptualization of Icewind Dale II progressed during the development of the Icewind Dale expansions, and production began late July 2001, shortly after the completion of [...] After six months of development, Icewind Dale II was officially announced on February 4, 2002.|$|E

When <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> {{some of the more}} technical details of biomechanics, he (Patterson) showed the familiar blank look of a student who had lost the drift of the explanation, but was still trying hard to pay attention.

2500|$|After his nomination, Jackson {{received}} backlash {{for some}} of his past statements that have been perceived as derogatory to gays, blacks, and Democrats. Jackson and some observers have noted the challenge of differentiating between statements made in a ministry setting and those made in a political setting. Jackson said, [...] "I {{have been forced to}} clarify those views because they went back and picked out ministry settings where <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> these things and brought them into my campaign. Then I feel like I {{have no choice but to}} clarify." [...] Coby Dillard, a Norfolk Republican, observed that some of the criticism stems from the fact that commentary acceptable in a church setting is received differently in a political campaign. Jackson said that by critiquing his comments made in a ministry context, his opponents were trying to impose a religious test to say that anyone who takes a traditional view of the Bible is unfit for public office.|$|E

The House Intelligence Committee requested Caputo come in and be interviewed voluntarily and submit to the Committee relevant documents associated with their investigation. During a March 20, 2017 hearing, Representative Jackie Speier questioned FBI Director James Comey about Caputo, and cited employment with Gazprom and history in Ukraine. Caputo worked with the House Intelligence Committee in order to acquiesce to their queries. Posting to social media, Caputo denied ties to Russia while on the Trump campaign. Caputo told the House Intelligence Committee: [...] "The only time the President and <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> Russia was in 2013, when he simply asked me in passing what it was like to live there in the context of a dinner conversation."

2500|$|Theisen placed {{second at}} the Canadian Track and Field Championships {{and went on}} to finish {{eleventh}} in the heptathlon at the 2012 London Olympics. A score of 6376 points at the 2013 Hypo Meeting was enough to win the high-profile event ahead of Tatyana Chernova, and she formed a rare Canadian combined events double alongside the men's winner Damian Warner. The 2013 World Championships in Athletics was a wide open event in the heptathlon in that two of the world's best competitors in Chernova and Jessica Ennis-Hill both missed the competition as a result of injuries. Despite putting up a personal best 6,530 points, she had to settle for silver, just 56 points behind eventual World Champion Hanna Melnichenko. After Gotzis, this was the second major competition in a row where the Canadian men and women multi-eventers had a double medal meeting after Warner won bronze at the world championships; however, a double gold for the power couple of Eaton and Eaton-Theisen was narrowly missed. She commented on her achievement saying [...] "I'm at peace getting silver knowing I gave it 110 per cent. Ashton and <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> both being on the podium here.
