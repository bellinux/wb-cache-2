Frequently enough, when I used to have the happiness of being near you, has this confession hovered on my tongue; but my confidence always forsook me, when I tried to utter it. My best friend! Your goodness, your affection, your generosity of heart, have encouraged me in a hope which I can justify by nothing but the friendship and respect you have always shown me. My free, unconstrained access to your house {{afforded me the opportunity}} of intimate acquaintance with your amiable daughter; and the frank, kind treatment with which both you and she honoured me, tempted my heart to entertain the bold wish of becoming your son.

[...] He went on in 1993, with Dr Sam Everington of the Medical Practitioners Union to devise a project that would try and actually determine whether discrimination was real. They took two sets of application forms one with an Asian name and one with an English name. They constructed applications so that they were {{almost exactly the same}} in terms of the age of the applicant, in terms of where the applicant qualified and in terms of their experience. They then sent one application with an English name and one with an Asian name to 30 hospitals which were advertising vacancies. They found that the white applicant was twice as likely to be short-listed as the Asian applicant. As a result of complaints he and Everington were arrested and charged with making fraudulent job applications. Their paper was published in the BMJ and they were threatened by the General Medical Council with a charge of behaviour which was unbecoming of the medical profession. On further investigation they discovered that ethnic minority doctors were 6 {{times more likely to be}} brought before the Professional Conduct Committee of the General Medical Council than white doctors.|$|E

40|$|My {{research}} question deals with how bilingual people conceptualize {{their use of}} the English language keeping in mind their identity as a bilingual speaker.

This topic is extremely relevant given our current state of immigration within the United States.

Language is how we communicate, think, feel, and move throughout our day to day lives.
