5|$|Mitchell and Galle were {{terminated}} from WCMH in June 2009. A {{few days}} later, both nurses were arrested. They {{were charged with}} misuse of official information, a felony that carries the possibility of ten years imprisonment and fines up to $5,000. Roberts said that the nurses filed the complaint as a personal vendetta {{rather than as a}} good faith reporting of facts. He also noted that Mitchell and Galle sent the medical records of ten patients to the TMB without their consent; however, the reports did not include the names of patients and federal law <b>exempts</b> medical board reports from patient privacy laws.|$|E
5|$|In From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney {{writes that}} Harold Andrews bullies Ellen Ripley, who is {{demoralized}} {{after the events}} of the first two Alien films. According to Kaveney, Andrews' method of directing the prison from monitors is ironic because David Fincher directed the film the same way (which Sigourney Weaver disliked). In David Fincher: Films That Scar, a literary analysis of the director, Mark Browning writes that Harold Andrews' totalitarian control of Fury 161 <b>exempts</b> Dillon's religiosity because Andrews views religion as a tool to prevent violence and provide control. Film critic Malcolm Johnson wrote in a Hartford Courant review that Andrews was a petty but potent dictator, similar to Benito Mussolini.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} Delius did not confine himself to purely orchestral works; he {{produced}} his final opera, Fennimore and Gerda (1908–10), like A Village Romeo and Juliet written in tableau form, {{but in his}} mature style. His choral works of the period, notably An Arabesque (1911) and A Song of the High Hills (1911) {{are among the most}} radical of Delius's writings in their juxtapositions of unrelated chords. The latter work, entirely wordless, contains some of the most difficult choral music in existence, according to Heseltine. After 1915, Delius turned his attention to traditional sonata, chamber and concerto forms, which he had largely left alone since his apprentice days. Of these pieces Payne highlights two: the Violin Concerto (1916), as an example of how, writing in unfamiliar genres, Delius remained stylistically true to himself; and the Cello Sonata of 1917, which, lacking the familiarity of an orchestral palate, becomes a melodic triumph. Cardus's verdict, however, is that Delius's chamber and concerto works are largely failures. After 1917, according to Payne, there was a general deterioration in {{the quantity and quality of}} Delius's output as illness took hold, although Payne <b>exempts</b> the incidental music to Hassan (1920–23) from condemnation, believing it to contain some of Delius's best work.|$|E

40|$|Most “for-profit” or “business” {{activities}} of <b>exempt</b> organizations {{take one of}} three forms: (A) The <b>exempt</b> organization may undertake to perform the business activities within the existing structure of the <b>exempt</b> organization.

(C) The <b>exempt</b> organization may “partner” with other individuals and entities (both nonprofit and for-profit) to form a corporation, limited liability company (LLC), partnership, joint venture, strategic alliance, or other collaborative effort which will perform the “for-profit” activities. Depending in part upon which of these forms is chosen, any business activities by an <b>exempt</b> organization may result in: (i) income taxes being imposed upon the <b>exempt</b> organization or the “for-profit” entity; (ii) the <b>exempt</b> organization losing its tax-exempt status; (iii) excise taxes being imposed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the individuals and for-profit companies (as {{well as on the}} managers of the <b>exempt</b> organization) with whom the tax-exempt organization conducts a business activity; (iv) a regulatory action brought against the organization by federal or state governmental authorities; or (v) all of the above.
