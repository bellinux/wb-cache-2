The publishing firm of Frederick Warne & Co. wanted to compete in this lucrative market and chose to publish Peter Rabbit after receiving an enthusiastic endorsement from their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. The illustrations were reproduced by the then-new Hentschel <b>three-colour</b> <b>process</b> which favoured a painterly rather than a linear style and was kinder to watercolours than chromolithography.|$|R

He was a pupil and chorister at St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral School, Palmerston Place, Edinburgh, under Dr Thomas Collinson and at the School of Arts (now Heriot-Watt University) where he studied photoprocess engraving. His early {{employment}} was in photo-press engraving at Hislop and Day (Edinburgh), then in Glasgow. Subsequently he studied at Bolt Court in London, learning the new <b>three-colour</b> <b>process.</b> Hislop was aware of his vocal ability, but his chances of making a progression into the professional ranks of classical music were dismissed by Dr Collinson. He was sent from Bolt Court to Gothenburg to introduce the latest photoprocess methods to a firm in that Swedish city.|$|R

5000|$|In 1900, Potter revised her {{tale about}} the four little rabbits, and {{fashioned}} a dummy book of it - {{it has been}} suggested, in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1899 bestseller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer for the work, she published it {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901. It was drawn in black and white with a coloured frontispiece. Family friend Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley had great faith in Potter's tale, recast it in didactic verse, and made the rounds of the London publishing houses. Frederick Warne & Co had previously rejected the tale but, eager to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted the [...] "bunny book" [...] (as the firm called it) following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. The firm declined Rawnsley's verse in favour of Potter's original prose, and Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations, choosing the then new Hentschel <b>three-colour</b> <b>process</b> to reproduce her watercolours.On 2 October 1902, The Tale of Peter Rabbit was published, and was an immediate success. It was followed the next year by The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester, which had also first been written as picture letters to the Moore children. Working with Norman Warne as her editor, Potter published two or three little books each year: 23 books in all. The last book in this format was Cecily Parsley's Nursery Rhymes in 1922, a collection of favourite rhymes. Although The Tale of Little Pig Robinson was not published until 1930, it had been written much earlier. Potter continued creating her little books until after the First World War, when her energies were increasingly directed toward her farming, sheep-breeding and land conservation.|$|R
5000|$|The statues are {{assembled}} {{from several}} pieces of glazed terracotta (not stoneware as sometimes said), [...] with their bases made separately, {{and using a}} combination of moulded and freely formed [...] "slab-constructed" [...] sections. They use the difficult sancai <b>three-colour</b> glazing <b>process</b> (here in fact often including four colours), which requires two firings. This was widely used for vessels and figures found in T'ang dynasty (618-907) tombs (this set in London is a good example), but from the mid-8th century is rarely found in most of China. However the regional Liao dynasty, founded by the semi-nomadic Khitan people, continued to use the style, although normally for vessels rather than figures, and Beijing and Yixian were on the southern edge of their state, with Beijing (as [...] "Nanjing") their southern capital.|$|R

In the next few years, Potter published books similar in concept, style, or format to Peter Rabbit: The Tailor of Gloucester and The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin in 1903, and the tales of Benjamin Bunny and Two Bad Mice in 1904. In August 1905, sales profits and a small legacy from an aunt enabled Potter to buy Hill Top, a working farm of 34 acres and 36 perches (13.85 ha) in the Lake District. In the years immediately following its purchase, she produced tales and illustrations inspired by the farm, its woodland surroundings, and nearby villages. Potter worked on sketches for Jemima Puddle-Duck during the winter of 1907 while recuperating from respiratory infections. She accompanied her parents on a holiday to Sidmouth in April 1908, and continued to work on Jemima Puddle-Duck. Potter's cousin Caroline Hutton Clark was at Hill Top during the composition of Jemima Puddle-Duck and joined Potter as she searched the farmstead for a suitable place in which to situate Jemima's nest for the illustrations. Kep was a real dog, and Mrs. Clark was given one of Kep's sons. She later described the puppy as [...] "the dearest and cleverest dog I ever had." ...|$|R
