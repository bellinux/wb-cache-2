5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies to think she <b>is</b> <b>suggesting</b> masturbating to rid the town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. The clumsiness of the characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they want it to. The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish {{the opposite of what}} they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two Buffy essayists, part of the horror stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is the silence that makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|E

500|$|While in Skinner's office, {{the camera}} angles and {{position}} of the characters reveals that the scene {{is intended to be}} a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting The Last Supper. Skinner is standing in Saint Peter's spot, and Scully is standing in Judas Iscariot's place. Bush argues that, in this manner, the show <b>is</b> <b>suggesting</b> that Scully, like Judas, directly affects the fate of the savior, in this case Mulder. She notes that Scully's actions result in a fate that [...] "could not be realized without her participation". This {{is not the first time}} Scully has been compared to Judas in the show: the previous seventh season episode [...] ""—which is heavily based on Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ—features Scully in a role with direct literary parallels to Kazantzakis's heroic interpretation of Judas.|$|E
500|$|People who {{criticized the}} song's message {{included}} Ellen Goodman, a national syndicated columnist, {{who called the}} video [...] "a commercial for teenage pregnancy". Feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, the spokeswoman of the National Organization for Women (NOW), angrily called for Madonna to make a public statement or another record supporting the opposite point of view. Alfred Moran, {{the executive director of}} Planned Parenthood of New York City, also criticized the song, fearing that it would undermine efforts to promote birth control among adolescents and that it would encourage teenage pregnancy. Recalling how his agency's clinics were filled in 1985 with girls wearing clothes that were an imitation of Madonna's style, Moran said that the song's message is [...] "that getting pregnant is cool and having the baby is the right thing and a good thing and don't listen to your parents, the school, anybody who tells you otherwise—don't preach to me, Papa. The reality is that what Madonna <b>is</b> <b>suggesting</b> to teenagers is a path to permanent poverty." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{scene with}} Grampa and Bea eating their pills seductively is a {{reference}} to the 1963 film Tom Jones. Two of the people waiting in line to ask for Grampa's money are Darth Vader and the Joker. When the family <b>is</b> <b>suggesting</b> places they could go, Homer suggests the Springfield Mystery Spot, {{a reference to}} the Mystery Spot in California—although Lisa says that the Springfield Spot is simply a puddle of mud. They eventually decide to go to the Discount Lion Safari, however. The Diz-Nee-Land amusement park that Grampa visits with Bea's money has a sign that reads [...] "Diz-Nee-Land—Not affiliated with Disneyland, Walt Disney World, or anything else from the Walt Disney Company". The shot of Grampa sitting at a diner resembles the 1942 American painting Nighthawks. Before Grampa attempts to bet all of his money on Roulette he quotes the poem [...] "If—" [...] by Rudyard Kipling. The climax scenes, where Grampa uses the money to fix up the Springfield Retirement Castle, is {{a reference to the}} ending of the 1932 film If I Had a Million. Dr. Marvin Monroes 'Monroe Box' is meant to be a spoof of B. F. Skinners Skinner Box.|$|E
500|$|A love poem, [...] "The Good-Morrow" [...] is thematically {{centred on}} several concepts. The poem is {{primarily}} {{to do with}} evolving love; the movement from pure lust, in the first stanza, to a nascent and evolving spirituality which liberates the lovers because they no longer [...] "watch each other out of fear" [...] but can instead see clearly. The lovers' faith in each other allows them to be brave, unlike the Seven Sleepers, who were forced out of fear to hide their beliefs; with love, the lovers can allow others to pursue their own dreams, accepting that [...] "Let us possess one world; each hath one, and is one" [...] – with each other, {{there is no need}} to search further for adventure. Harold Bloom notes the intertwining of both sensual and spiritual love, arguing that Donne <b>is</b> <b>suggesting</b> that it is impossible for those buried in sensual love, [...] "busying themselves in mundane matters", to experience true love. Donne's emphasis on the importance of spiritual love can be seen from the biblical allusions; Achsah Guibbory states that the tone and wording of the poem is an intentional reference to Paul the Apostle's description of divine, agapic love; [...] "At moments like these...eros merges with agape. Walls collapse, the veil parts, we know as we are known; our deepest, truest selves exposed". Alfred W. Satterthwaite, writing in The Explicator, argues that the story of the Seven Sleepers itself contains this theme; in the story, the Sleepers awoke to find themselves [...] "thunderstruck" [...] in their new environment, something analogous to [...] "the radiant revelation love grants to the lovers in the poem".|$|E

2500|$|According to Krugman, the {{key problem}} is that the scrip's value is fixed. Couples know that each scrip they save in the winter can be {{redeemed}} for {{the same amount of time}} in the summer, giving them incentive to save because, psychologically speaking, each scrip's value is worth more to them in the summer than in the winter. Instead, if the co-op modified the system so that the scrip is redeemable for less time in the upcoming summer than in the winter, there would be less incentive to save because members would get less [...] "bang for their buck" [...] if they chose to hold onto the scrip until the summer. In other words, Krugman <b>is</b> <b>suggesting</b> that the co-op should have an inflationary monetary policy.|$|E

In his policy papers thus far, Cullen has also advanced a number of other ideas such as: creating a national public transit strategy, instituting carbon cap-and-trade pricing, putting a moratorium on new genetically modified organisms, redefining the Canadian Wheat Board, and holding a referendum on voting reform (Nathan supports Mixed-member proportional representation as currently utilized in New Zealand and Germany).|$|E

It seems as if the speaker is insinuating that the beauty will die with the young man. The last line of the couplet says, [...] "which usèd, lives th'executor to be." [...] Here {{it seems as if the}} speaker is saying that if the young man uses his beauty, then it will prolong his life. The word [...] "executor" [...] hints at both death and accounting.|$|E
2500|$|According to Deacon, this {{occurred}} between 2 and 2.5 million years ago, {{when we have}} the first fossil evidence of stone tool use and the beginning of a trend in an increase in brain size. But it is the evolution of symbolic language which is the cause—and not the effect—of these trends. More specifically, Deacon <b>is</b> <b>suggesting</b> that Australopithecines, like contemporary apes, used tools; it is possible that over the millions of years of Australopithecine history, many troops developed symbolic communication systems. All that was necessary was that one of these groups so altered their environment that [...] "it introduced selection for very different learning abilities than affected prior species." [...] This troop or population kick-started the Baldwinian process (the [...] "ratchet effect") that led to their evolution to genus Homo.|$|E
2500|$|Rogers {{identified}} the [...] "real self" [...] as {{the aspect of}} one's being that is founded in the actualizing tendency, follows organismic valuing, needs and receives positive regard and self-regard.

On the other hand, {{to the extent that}} our society is out of sync with the actualizing tendency, and we are forced to live with conditions of worth that are out of step with organismic valuing, and receive only conditional positive regard and self-regard, we develop instead an [...] "ideal self". [...] By ideal, Rogers <b>is</b> <b>suggesting</b> something not real, something that is always out of our reach, the standard we cannot meet. This gap between the real self and the ideal self, the [...] "I am" [...] and the [...] "I should" [...] is called incongruity.|$|E

2500|$|Eoraptor had {{a slender}} body that grew to about [...] in length, with an {{estimated}} weight of about [...] It had a lightly built skull with a slightly enlarged external naris. Like the coelophysoids which would appear millions of years later, Eoraptor had a kink in its upper jaws, between the maxilla and the premaxilla. Paul Sereno et al.

The femur of the holotype specimen PVSJ 512 is , and the tibia <b>is</b> , <b>suggesting</b> {{that it was a}} fast runner. Its forelimbs are only half the length of its hindlimbs, suggesting that it was bipedal. All of its long bones have hollow shafts. Eoraptor had five digits on each 'hand', the three longest of which ended in large claws and were presumably used to handle prey. Scientists have surmised that the fourth and fifth digits were too tiny to be of any use in hunting. The ilium is supported by three sacral vertebrae, unlike that of the coeval Herrerasaurus which is supported by only two sacrals, a basal trait. Eoraptor had vertebral centra that are hollow, a feature present in some of its ancestors.|$|E

Wherefore pity them, pray for them, encourage them; they need all this: guilt hath overtaken them, fears of the wrath of God hath overtaken them.
