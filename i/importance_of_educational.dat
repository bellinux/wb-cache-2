Constantine {{has always had a}} love of Russian conductors, and because Yuri Temirkanov was conductor of the Baltimore Symphony at that time, it was an opportunity he gladly seized. He knew of Temirkanov’s sterling reputation as a guest conductor for the leading orchestras of Europe, Asia and the United States and of his longtime position as Music Director and Chief Conductor of the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic in Russia. Within Constantine’s first season in Baltimore, he was promoted to Associate Conductor, consistently working many of the orchestra’s main concerts whilst stressing the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>educational</b> concerts which he himself took charge of as well. As he states, “I really see the education concerts as the future of this whole business. It's all about how to get enough kids through the door, and literally leave no child behind.

5000|$|Although Bourdieu {{went into}} great detail in his {{discourse}} on social, cultural and symbolic capital, {{he does not}} appear to consider the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>educational</b> capital as critical in and of itself. Bourdieu does however, mention academic capital in Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste: [...] Academic capital is in fact the guaranteed product of the combined effects of cultural transmission by the family and cultural transmission by the school (the efficiency of which depends on the amount of cultural capital directly inherited from the family). Through its value-inculcating and value-imposing operations, the school also helps (to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the initial disposition, i.e., class of origin) to form a general, transposable disposition towards legitimate culture, which is first acquired with respect to scholastically recognized knowledge and practices but tends to be applied beyond the bounds of the curriculum, taking the form of a 'disinterested' propensity to accumulate experience and knowledge which may not be directly profitable in the academic market(23).|$|E
50|$|The {{intent of}} this excerpt {{is to support}} the work of {{transfer}} in educational materials readily available and for other users to incorporate their ideas as well. Hopefully this article may aid in the planning phase, teaching, and day to day lesson plans when thinking about the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>educational</b> transfer in the future. When I think of learning theories I think of educational transfer. Educational transfer is important and should be dually noted that researchers, educators, and the like {{need to know how}} to teach for transfer. The idea of transfer is seldom specified. However, it is one of the most important goals that we can teach our students. The ultimate goal is for the student to be able to apply their knowledge and skills inside and outside of the classroom, specifically to new cases. Transfer of knowledge goes far beyond simply repeating memorized material but to being able to take old knowledge and experiences and apply this old knowledge to a new concept and being able to use both the new and old knowledge to solving a problem that you have never encountered before. This mode of thinking about the process of learning and transfer resonates with the Gestalt theory of learning.|$|E
