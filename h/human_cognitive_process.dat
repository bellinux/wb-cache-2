It is mentioned that due to the <b>human</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>process,</b> the alignment towards a single method of thinking is simply not possible. Even when individuals adopt a sequential method of solving a problem, between the initiation and conclusion of the question there has to exist some form of creativity.

The ease of {{everyday}} human-human spatial communication suggests that <b>human</b> spatial <b>cognitive</b> <b>processes</b> {{may provide a}} model for developing artificial spatial communi-cation systems that fluidly interact with human users. To this end, we develop a neurody-namic model of human spatial language that combines linguistic spatial and color terms with neurally-grounded scene representations.

40|$|Objective: To explore {{multiple}} {{relationships in}} traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) knowledge by comparing binary and multiple relationships during knowledge organization. Methods: Characteristics of binary and multiple semantic relationships {{as well as}} their associations are described. A method to classify multiple relationships based on the involvement of time is proposed and theoretically validated using examples from the ancient TCM classic Important Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces. The classification includes parallel multiple relationships, restricted multiple relationships, multiple relationships that involve time, and multiple relationships that involve time restriction. Next, construction of multiple semantic relationships for TCM concepts in each classification using Protégé, an ontology editing tool is described. Results: Protégé is superior to a binary relationship and less than ideal with multiple relationships during the constitution of concept relationships. Conclusion: When applied in TCM, the semantic relationships constructed by Protégé are superior than those constructed by correlation and/or attribute relationships, but less ideal than those constructed by the <b>human</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>process...</b>|$|E
40|$|Cultural {{evolution}} and cognitive science need each other. Cultural evolution needs cognitive science {{to find out}} whether the conditions necessary for Darwinian evolution are met in the cultural domain. Cognitive science needs cultural evolution to explain the origins of distinctively <b>human</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>processes.</b> Focussing on the first question, I argue that cultural evolutionists can get empirical traction on third-way cultural selection by rooting the distinction between replication and reconstruction, two modes of cultural inheritance, in the distinction between System 1 and System 2 <b>cognitive</b> <b>processes.</b> This move suggests that cultural epidemiologists are right in thinking that replication has higher fidelity than reconstruction, and replication processes are not genetic adaptations for culture, but wrong to assume that replication is rare. If replication is not rare, an important requirement for third-way cultural selection, one-shot fidelity, is likely to be met. However, there are other requirements, overlooked by dual-inheritance theorists when they conflate strong (Darwinian) and weak (choice) senses of ‘cultural selection’, including: dumb choices and recurrent fidelity. In a second excursion into cognitive science, I argue that these requirements can be met by metacognitive social learning strategies, and trace the origins of these distinctively <b>human</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>processes</b> to cultural evolution. Like other forms of cultural learning, they are not cognitive instincts but cognitive gadgets...|$|R
