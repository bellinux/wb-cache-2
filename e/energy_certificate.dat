50|$|The Renewable <b>Energy</b> <b>Certificate</b> System (RECS) was a {{voluntary}} system for {{international trade in}} renewable energy certificates that was created by RECS International to stimulate international development of renewable energy. It advocated {{the use of a}} standard <b>energy</b> <b>certificate</b> to provide evidence of the production of a quantity of renewable energy, and provided a methodology which enables renewable energy trade, enabling the creation of a market for renewable energy and so promoting the development of new renewable energy capacity in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The European <b>Energy</b> <b>Certificate</b> System (EECS) is {{a commercially}} funded, {{integrated}} European framework for issuing, holding, transferring and otherwise processing electronic records. It {{was developed by}} the Association of Issuing Bodies to provide a properly regulated platform for Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin, as proposed by the Renewables Directive which supports Directive 2009/72/EC (the Internal Electricity Market Directive). EECS builds upon the concept proposed by the Basic Commitment of the Renewable <b>Energy</b> <b>Certificate</b> System (RECS) and now supports all types of electricity, regardless of source or production technology.|$|E
