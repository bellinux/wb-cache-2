40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{generate}} a performance model for an order-to-delivery (OTD) process in <b>delivery</b> scheduling <b>environments.</b> It aims to do this with a triadic approach, encompassing a customer, a supplier and a logistics service provider. Design/methodology/approach – The paper takes the form of a conceptual analysis and a triadic case study on performance measurement requirements in an OTD process characterized by delivery scheduling, and generating performance models. Findings – Two OTD process performance models, one for the supplier’s delivery sub-process and one for the customer’s delivery scheduling, the logistics service provider’s transportation and the customer’s good receipt sub-process, in <b>delivery</b> scheduling <b>environments</b> are generated. Research limitations/implications – A single case study limits the levels of external validity and reliability to analytical generalization. Practical implications – The generated performance models include definitions of four sub-processes and outline ten performance dimensions that should be of relevance for several companies to apply. Originality/value – This is the first approach that generates performance models for a triadic OTD process for use in <b>delivery</b> scheduling <b>environments...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: To {{address the}} low success rate in {{information}} system (IS) projects, organisations in South Africa are adopting agile implementation methodologies. Agile <b>delivery</b> <b>environments</b> advocate an iterative approach where autonomous, self-organising teams share project management (PM) activities. This encroaches {{on the traditional}} project manager role. Are project managers still relevant in agile <b>delivery</b> <b>environments</b> and how should they adapt? Objectives: This case study investigated how project managers could adapt to agile IS implementation environments to remain relevant. Specifically, the views of their key stakeholders (the management and implementation teams) were elicited to provide insights into what is expected from agile project managers. Method: A qualitative, inductive content analysis approach using purposive sampling was used to identify 13 participants (comprising management and implementation team members) within a large South African insurance company. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} all participants. Results: The management and implementation teams agreed that PM remains highly relevant in an agile environment for ensuring project governance including delivery, risk management, reporting and budgeting. There was, however, disagreement between the management and implementation teams on project management interaction with the implementation team. Management preferred a command and control type project manager, while the implementation team favoured a more inclusive, facilitative PM style. Conclusion: To remain viable in an agile IS project implementation environment within large corporates, project managers {{need to be aware of}} what various stakeholders expect of them. They need to retain some of the classic PM functions while adapting to the interpersonal and collaborative requirements of the agile way. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{efficient}} authoring {{of learning}} content {{is a central}} problem of courseware engineering. Courseware authors will appreciate the benefits of tools which automate various authoring tasks. We describe a system, OntAWare, which provides an environment comprising a set of software tools that support learning content authoring, management and delivery. This system exploits an opportunity provided by the emerging technologies of the Semantic Web movement, most notably knowledge-representation standards and knowledge-processing techniques. The system represents {{a combination of these}} newer developments with earlier work in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). A key feature of the authoring environment is the semi-automatic generation of standard e-learning and other courseware elements (learning objects). Widely available standardised knowledge representations (ontologies) and ontology-structured content are used as source material. Standard courseware elements are produced by the application of graph transformations to these ontologies. The resulting products can be hosted by standards-compliant delivery environments. Adaptivity is an important characteristic of the system as a whole. Authors can select and customise new or existing subject ontologies and employ an appropriate teaching/learning strategy in the generation of learning objects. Instructors can configure the <b>delivery</b> <b>environment</b> either to offer strictly sequenced presentations to students, or to allow also varying degrees of free student navigation, based on the the runtime incorporation of domain ontologies.

Analysis of delivered protein by size exclusion chromatography gave no indication of insulin-like, surface-induced aggregation phenomena.

40|$|The writers {{present a}} set of {{hypotheses}} testing the strength of organizational ecology theory's environmental determinism perspective and the adaptation perspective. Some of these hypotheses are analayzed relative to data on hospital closures in the United States between 1980 and 1985. Initial empirical analyses indicate that environmental determinism's liability of smallness holds relative to hospital closure, but the liability of newness doesn't hold. There are no published accounts where the liability of newness hypothesis hasn't held in research on other industries. The writers speculate that the inverse relationship between a highly changing health care environment and the liability of newness of hospitals may be because newer hospitals {{are better able to}} tap into the ongoing changes of the today's turbulent health care <b>delivery</b> <b>environment</b> in the United States. Also, analysis findings show that the environmental interdependence orientation of the adaptation models has some explanatory power in that hospitals with greater community support have much lower closure rates. Consideration of the more organization action oriented framework of the adaptation perspective is called for over the environmental determinism perspective that has been promoted in recent publications. The writers suggest that the more community sponsored a hospital is, the less likely its survival will hinge solely on standard environmental selection criteria, and that the ability of a hospital's administration to correctly adapt to environmental fluctuations is critical, especially in today's turbulent health care <b>delivery</b> <b>environment</b> in the United States. organizations ecology hospitals [...] United States and closure...|$|E
