5000|$|... #Caption: A {{high-voltage}} <b>disconnect</b> <b>switch</b> used in {{an electrical}} substation. Such switches are used mostly to isolate circuits, and usually cannot break load current. High-voltage switches are available for the highest transmission voltages, up to 1 million volts. This switch is gang-operated so that all three phases are interrupted at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Most small {{generator}} connections {{require a}} mechanical <b>disconnect</b> <b>switch,</b> so {{at a minimum}} the utility could send a repairman to pull them all. For very large sources, one might simply install a dedicated telephone hotline {{that can be used}} to have an operator manually shut down the generator. In either case, the reaction time is likely to be on the order of minutes, or hours.|$|E
50|$|Fuseholders may {{be secured}} by screws to a panel, {{attached}} to bus bars, or mounted on DIN rails. For the Neozed fuses, {{there are also}} fuse bases with integrated <b>disconnecting</b> <b>switches.</b> Changing fuses with the circuit off increases {{the safety of the}} user. With new versions of these load <b>disconnecting</b> <b>switches,</b> the fuse cartridges are no longer screwed, but are held by spring clips.|$|R
50|$|The open-air <b>disconnecting</b> <b>switches</b> {{typically}} need maintenance {{every five}} years (every two years under very polluted conditions), while circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years.|$|R
50|$|Switchgear is a {{combination}} of electrical <b>disconnect</b> <b>switches,</b> fuses or circuit breakers used to control, protect and isolate electrical equipment. Switches are safe to open under normal load current, while protective devices are safe to open under fault current.|$|R
50|$|These meters {{are fully}} {{electronic}} and smart, with integrated bi-directional communications, advanced power measurement and management capabilities, an integrated, software-controllable <b>disconnect</b> <b>switch,</b> and an all solid-state design. They communicate over low {{voltage power line}} using standards-based power line technology from Echelon Corporation to Echelon data concentrators at which point they communicate via IP to Enel's enterprise servers. Demonstrating that with power line communication, smart meters don't require WiFi radios.|$|E
50|$|In {{a common}} design, {{incoming}} lines have a <b>disconnect</b> <b>switch</b> and a circuit breaker. In some cases, the lines {{will not have}} both, with either a switch or a circuit breaker being all that is considered necessary. A <b>disconnect</b> <b>switch</b> is used to provide isolation, since it cannot interrupt load current. A circuit breaker {{is used as a}} protection device to interrupt fault currents automatically, and may be used to switch loads on and off, or to cut off a line when power is flowing in the 'wrong' direction. When a large fault current flows through the circuit breaker, this is detected through the use of current transformers. The magnitude of the current transformer outputs may be used to trip the circuit breaker resulting in a disconnection of the load supplied by the circuit break from the feeding point. This seeks to isolate the fault point {{from the rest of the}} system, and allow the rest of the system to continue operating with minimal impact. Both switches and circuit breakers may be operated locally (within the substation) or remotely from a supervisory control center.|$|E
50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, a disconnector, <b>disconnect</b> <b>switch</b> or {{isolator switch}} {{is used to}} ensure that an electrical circuit is completely de-energized for service or maintenance. Such switches are often found in electrical distribution and industrial applications, where machinery must have its source of driving power removed for adjustment or repair. High-voltage isolation switches are used in electrical substations to allow isolation of apparatus such as circuit breakers, transformers, and transmission lines, for maintenance. The disconnector is usually not intended for normal control of the circuit, but only for safety isolation. Disconnectors can be operated either manually or automatically.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{substation}} {{includes two}} to four 138/12 kV transformers, 138 kV air switches that permit isolation of individual transformers, shutdown {{one of the two}} 138 kV feeders, or cross-connection from one feeder to another. The output of the transformers is routed to the catenary via 12 kV circuit breakers and air <b>disconnect</b> <b>switches.</b> Cross-connect switches allow one transformer to feed all catenary lines.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is called}} [...] "Trapped Key" [...] as it works by {{releasing}} and trapping keys in a predetermined sequence. After the control or {{power has been}} isolated, a key is released {{that can be used}} to grant access to individual or multiple doors. For example, to prevent access to the inside of an electric kiln, a trapped key system may be used to interlock a <b>disconnecting</b> <b>switch</b> and the kiln door. While the switch is turned on, the key is held by the interlock attached to the <b>disconnecting</b> <b>switch.</b> To open the kiln door, the switch is first opened, which releases the key. The key can then be used to unlock the kiln door. While the key is removed from the switch interlock, a plunger from the interlock mechanically prevents the switch from closing. Power cannot be re-applied to the kiln until the kiln door is locked, releasing the key, and the key is then returned to the <b>disconnecting</b> <b>switch</b> interlock. A similar two-part interlock system can be used anywhere it is necessary to ensure the energy supply to a machine is interrupted before the machine is entered for adjustment or maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|A plug-in {{bus duct}} system or busway can have <b>disconnect</b> <b>switches</b> {{and other devices}} mounted on it, for example, to {{distribute}} power along a long building.

The main objective of the research is to evaluate the seismic fragility of the apparatus using a new effective method. By combining standard reliability methods for time-invariant problems with the response surface technique, this original procedure called ‘‘EFA’’ (Effective Fragility Analysis) permits the evaluation of fragility curves using a very limited number of numerical simulations. On the basis of experimental tests, to determine the mechanical characteristics of the <b>disconnect</b> <b>switch</b> components (ceramic, joints, etc.) the fragility curves of the equipment analyzed are carried out.

40|$|Voltage {{transients}} {{generated in}} GIS by {{the operation of}} circuit breakers or disconnect switches induce high voltages across interruptions of the enclosure. In this paper we discuss such interruptions and their necessity. We present fast measurements of voltage and current at the GIS/cable-interface of a 150 kV substation, where the enclosure is interrupted to permit current measurement. Circuit breaker operation causes a single voltage transient across the interruption with an amplitude up to 40 kV, a duration of 200 - 300 ns, and a risetime of about 5 ns. <b>Disconnect</b> <b>switch</b> operation causes multiple transients. each having a smaller amplitude and a longer risetime. The voltage across enclosure interruptions is adequately suppressed, and breakdown is completely eliminated, when the interruption is bridged with resistors. The resistors do not affect the current measurement...|$|E

40|$|A large {{microgrid}} {{project is}} nearing completion at Alameda County’s twenty-two-year-old 45 ha 4, 000 -inmate Santa Rita Jail, about 70 km east of San Francisco. Often {{described as a}} green prison, it has a considerable installed base of distributed energy resources (DER) including an eight-year old 1. 2 MW PV array, a five-year old 1 MW fuel cell with heat recovery, and considerable efficiency investments.

40|$|Switching {{operations}} of power {{equipment such as}} <b>disconnect</b> <b>switch</b> and circuit breakers in high voltage substations produce high frequency transient currents, which propagate along the busbars. The busbars then act as antennae, producing transient electromagnetic fields in the switchyards. In electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) considerations, the resulting fields are important sources of electromagnetic interference (EMI); moreover, highly sophisticated,. new technology equipment are being introduced into substation environment for measurement, control, protection and communication purposes. These equipment are located close to other switching equipment in switchyards. Hence, to establish the electromagnetic compatibility of the electronic equipment, it is desirable to quantify the high voltage environment. This paper describes a new digital wireless measurement system {{that is based on}} Bluetooth technology and which could be used in power stations or other similar harsh environment. It comprises a Remote Acquisition Unit (RAU), a Wireless Data Communication Network (WDCN) and a PC-based Control Platform.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the complete procedure carried out {{in order to determine}} the cause of high levels of gases detected in chromatographic determinations performed in Current Transformers (CT) oil. These analyses of gases are normally included in routine maintenance work. The obtained results could evidence some possible damage in the machine insulation. According to the electrical stresses that Current Transformers are typically subjected to, it was presumed that the cause of the possible damaged could be the high-frequency transients that take place during air <b>disconnect</b> <b>switch</b> operations. Therefore, with the aim of determining the presence of such electrical stress, field measurements were performed. A specially designed measuring system was utilized to accomplish this goal. Taking into account the difficulties normally encountered when measuring currents flowing through Current Transformers to ground, especially in terms of accuracy, it was decided to perform voltage measurements. Then, by determining the real frequency response of the CT in the range of interest, it was possible to achieve such currents by computer simulations. In order to achieve accurate results in the simulations, it was necessary to develop an appropriate electrical model of this type of transformers in the analyzed frequency range.

40|$|A {{condition}} monitoring (CM) system, which integrates wavelet analysis and artificial intelligent techniques {{to analyze the}} partial discharges (PD) patterns and classify the defective equipments in gas insulated switchgear (GIS), is presented here. The multi-resolution signal decomposition (MSD) attribute of the wavelet transform is employed to de-noise the PD signals measured on site, due to its spectrum decomposition capability. The performance of several well tried wavelets are investigated {{in the case of}} denoising, and this demonstrates that the combined use of the Biorthogonal and Daubechies type of wavelets achieves good de-noising results compared to other wavelet families. Different feature extraction methods are applied to the de-noised PD signals, to form pattern vectors which are further used as the inputs to a neural network based classifier, so as to identify the PD patterns and defective equipments in GIS. Several types of neural networks, both supervised and unsupervised (trained), are then evaluated with regard to their suitability as classifier according to training time and classification accuracy. Finally, the performance of the proposed CM system is ascertained by using a set of PD signals emanating from defects in a circuit breaker (CB), <b>disconnect</b> <b>switch</b> (DS), bus bar (BS) and insulation spacer (SP) in practical GISs in Korean 154 KV high voltage transmission networks...|$|E
