50|$|Veronica persica (common names: birdeye speedwell, common field-speedwell, Persian speedwell, large <b>field</b> <b>speedwell,</b> bird's-eye, or winter speedwell) (سیزاب ایرانی) is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} plantain family Plantaginaceae. It is native to Eurasia and is widespread as an introduced species in the British Isles (where it was first recorded in 1825), North America, and eastern Asia, including Japan and Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{diversity}} of plants, especially in the meadow area. Some recently seen plants include Birdsfoot trefoil, Bloody cranesbill, Corncockle, Cowslip, Dog rose, Evening primrose, <b>Field</b> <b>speedwell,</b> Lesser periwinkle, Michaelmas daisy, Oxeye daisy, Vipers bugloss, Sweet violet, Lucerne, Wild gladiolus, Green alkanet, Herb robert, Lesser celandine, Marsh marigold, Purple loosestrife, Yellow flag, Wild strawberry, Yarrow and many others. Some of these have been introduced, others found their own way here.|$|E
50|$|Plants: A {{total of}} over 400 {{species have been}} found in the Forest. Some of the more common ones are: white clover, common spotted orchid, selfheal, sheep’s sorrel, herb robert, bugle, agrimony, bee orchid, {{perforate}} St John’s wort, common <b>field</b> <b>speedwell,</b> bird's foot trefoil and, perhaps, most notable of all, buttercups (the Forest has perhaps the most extensive fields of buttercups in England during late May and early June). In addition over 600 species of fungi can be seen.|$|E
50|$|Veronica polita or Grey Field-speedwell is a {{herbaceous}} {{flowering plant}} {{species in the}} plantain family Plantaginaceae. It has hairy stems, is either prostrate or ascending, with dark green leaves that are one of petiolate, crenate, toothed, rounded, or oval. All flowers are small and bright blue. The plant has solitary axillary peduncles that are shorter or slightly longer than the leaves.

40|$|A {{range of}} weed species were grown in all {{combinations}} with four crop species (wheat, barley, bean and oilseed rape) {{under field conditions}} of 1990 - 91. The weeds were ranked {{on the basis of}} their competitive abilities. The degree to which competitive ability was specific to particular combination of crops and weed species was examined. Two indices-crop equivalent and aggressivity were compared to measure the competitive ability of the weeds. Based on aggressivity the ranking order of the weeds for their competitive abilities was, cleavers (Galium aparine L.) > wild oats (Avena fatua L.) > <b>field</b> <b>speedwell</b> (Veronica persica Poir.) > common chickweed (Stellaria media L. Cyrill.) > scented mayweed (Matricaria recutita). The ranking of the weeds varied depending on the associated crop and at different growth stages. There was a poor correlation between crop equivalent and aggressivity...|$|E
