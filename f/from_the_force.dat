5|$|Following the explosion, the {{remaining}} gunmen {{opened fire on}} the dazed band members, who had all been knocked down into the field {{below the level of}} the road <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of the blast. The order to shoot was given by the patrol's apparent leader, James McDowell, to eliminate witnesses to the bogus checkpoint and subsequent bombing. Three of the musicians were killed: lead singer Fran O'Toole, trumpeter Brian McCoy, and guitarist Tony Geraghty.|$|E

The house is simultaneously being watched by Tapp, who has since been discharged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>force.</b> Flashbacks show that Tapp became obsessed with the Jigsaw case after hearing Amanda's testimony, and eventually found Jigsaw's warehouse using the videotape from her game. He and Sing entered the warehouse, where they apprehended Jigsaw and saved a man from a drill trap, but Jigsaw escaped after non-fatally slashing Tapp's throat, and Sing {{was killed by a}} quadruple shotgun walkway while pursuing him. Convinced that Lawrence is Jigsaw, Tapp began stalking him after his discharge.|$|E

5|$|Operation Jackal, or {{alternatively}} Operation June Dawns, commenced on 7 June 1992. The attacking HV/HVO force moved {{east and north}} from Čapljina towards Stolac and Mostar aiming to push the VRS back from the Neretva River and capture positions around Mostar. The HV/HVO force captured the first objective of the offensive, the town of Tasovčići located across the Neretva River, opposite Čapljina, on 8 June. The HV component of the force which captured Tasovčići, the 156th Infantry Brigade, was detached <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> tasked with continued advance to capture Klepci and Prebilovci to protect the right flank of the Neretva bridgehead. The HV 116th Infantry Brigade held the Neretva River valley south of the bridgehead and east of Metković.|$|E

Upon his graduation, he took up employment with the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) (later merged into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police). Over the 30 years he spent with the NWMP, he was stationed at many locations throughout the North-West Territories, serving as Superintendent on four separate occasions before his retirement <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> in 1915.|$|E
5|$|Task Force Kean {{launched}} its attack on August 7, moving out from Masan, but Kean's offensive had collided {{in a meeting}} engagement with one being simultaneously delivered by the North Koreans. Heavy fighting continued {{in the area for}} three days. By August 9, Task Force Kean was poised to retake Chinju. The Americans initially advanced quickly though North Korean resistance was heavy. On August 10, the Marines picked up the advance. However, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> on August 12 to be redeployed elsewhere on the perimeter. Task Force Kean continued forward, capturing the area around Chondong-ni. Eighth Army requested several of its units to redeploy to Taegu to be used elsewhere on the front, particularly at the Naktong Bulge.|$|E

5|$|A former colonial marshal on the {{backwater}} {{planet of}} Mar Sara, Raynor joins Arcturus Mengsk's revolutionaries in their {{fight against the}} tyrannical and corrupt Confederacy of Man, where he develops a relationship with Sarah Kerrigan, Mengsk's second in command. However, he quickly comes to realise that Mengsk is far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> for good when he abandons Kerrigan and {{the entire population of}} a planet to die by the hand of the Zerg to satisfy his own thirst for power. Disillusioned and embittered, Raynor deserts Mengsk and becomes a persona non grata in the new Terran Dominion. The situation gets no better when Kerrigan, who was captured by the Zerg, is assimilated into the swarm and becomes one of their most powerful assets. After desertion, Raynor and his forces take part in major combat operations across the sector: He fights alongside the Protoss templar Tassadar in the battle that leads to the fall of the Zerg ruler, the Overmind, and splinters the Zerg into several factions. When the expeditionary forces of United Earth Directorate (UED) arrive in the sector to subjugate it, Raynor, Mengsk and Kerrigan (now calling herself the Queen of Blades) combine their Terran, Zerg and Protoss allies to repel the invasion. No sooner than they fall, the alliance shatters.|$|E
5|$|Contre-Admiral Leissègues' {{squadron}} was unchanged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> {{that left}} Brest on 13 December. All ships however, especially Jupiter and Diomède, had been badly damaged by storms off the Azores in late December and repairs were incomplete {{by the time}} of Duckworth's attack, most the fleet still undergoing caulking at Santo Domingo. Recognising that if he was caught at anchor he would be destroyed, Leissègues sent orders from his offices in Santo Domingo for the fleet to sail, joining them later by small boat. Trapped against the land with the wind from the west, Leissègues had no option but to form a line of battle and wait to meet the British squadron. Although his ships fought hard, they were unable to mutually support one another and were rapidly overwhelmed: three surrendered, while Diomède and Impérial were driven ashore and wrecked to prevent their capture. The only ships to escape were the two frigates and a corvette that and slipped between the French line and the land early in the battle and made sail to the west, eventually reaching France.|$|E
5|$|Frank Grimes' {{favorite}} television series, Dishonorable Discharge, ends {{after six}} seasons {{and it is}} revealed that the entire series was just an angel's dream. Grimes is outraged and determined to change the ending. Later, Mark Lilly tells his girlfriend, the half-demon Callie Maggotbone, {{that he has not}} seen his father since his sixth birthday. Mark's roommate, the zombie Randall, is touched by this and decides to document Mark's journey to find his father, so that he can become a Hollywood director. Mark is assigned by Twayne Boneraper to investigate Grimes, who has been busting people who enjoyed the ending of Dishonorable Discharge. He and Randall (who documents everything with his video camera) ride along with Grimes. In a memory sequence of Grimes', it is revealed that he was a real cop in the 1970s and worked with an undercover expert named Jimmy. He was dishonorably discharged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> and repressed all of his memories of being a cop. Mark figures that this is why he is so angry with the ending of the series, and takes him through his past by using the same car Grimes and his partner Jimmy had. In the car, Grimes has a memory sequence again and drives to Hollywood.|$|E

5|$|Gales and fog {{prevented}} the British from conducting further attacks between 25 and 28 August. On 25 August Indefatigable, Formidable, two cruisers and seven destroyers refuelled from the oilers. Both of the cruisers later detached <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> {{and returned to}} Scapa Flow. Duke of York, Furious, a cruiser and five destroyers also sailed to the Faroe Islands to load supplies. Before leaving the fleet, Furious transferred two Barracudas {{and a pair of}} Hellcats to Indefatigable. As the elderly Furious was judged to be no longer capable of combat operations, she proceeded from the Faroe Islands to Scapa Flow with the cruiser and several destroyers. On 29 August Duke of York and the remaining destroyers rejoined {{the main body of the}} Home Fleet off north Norway. During this period, the flying squadrons' maintenance personnel worked to repair aircraft which had been damaged during the 24 August attacks.|$|E
5|$|Lexington was at sea {{when the}} Pacific War began on 7 December 1941, {{ferrying}} fighter aircraft to Midway Island. Her mission was cancelled and {{she returned to}} Pearl Harbor a week later. After a few days, she was sent to create a diversion <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> en route to relieve the besieged Wake Island garrison by attacking Japanese installations in the Marshall Islands. The island was forced to surrender before the relief force got close enough, and the mission was cancelled. A planned attack on Wake Island in January 1942 had to be cancelled when a submarine sank the oiler required to supply the fuel for the return trip. Lexington {{was sent to the}} Coral Sea the following month to block any Japanese advances into the area. The ship was spotted by Japanese search aircraft while approaching Rabaul, New Britain, and her aircraft shot down most of the Japanese bombers that attacked her. Together with the carrier , she successfully attacked Japanese shipping off the east coast of New Guinea in early March.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, both of Wiesenthal's {{employers}} terminated {{his services}} in 1960, {{as there were}} too few refugees left {{in the city to}} justify the expense. Wiesenthal opened a new documentation centre (the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime) in Vienna in 1961. He became a Mossad operative, for which he received the equivalent of several hundred dollars per month. He maintained files on hundreds of suspected Nazi war criminals and located many, about six of whom were arrested {{as a result of his}} activities. Successes included locating and bringing to trial Erich Rajakowitsch, responsible for the deportation of Jews from the Netherlands, and Franz Murer, the commandant of the Vilna Ghetto. In 1963 Wiesenthal read in the newspaper that Karl Silberbauer, the man who had arrested famed diarist Anne Frank, had been located; he was serving on the police force in Vienna. Wiesenthal's publicity campaign led to Silberbauer being temporarily suspended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>force,</b> but he was never prosecuted for arresting the Frank family.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet {{occupation}} of Romania {{led to a}} complete reorganisation of the Romanian Land Forces {{under the supervision of}} the Red Army. At the onset, pro-German elements were purged from the Romanian armed forces. In 1944–45, two divisions were formed out of Romanian volunteers—ex-prisoners of war, trained and indoctrinated in the Soviet Union during the war, but also of many Communist activists. One was the Tudor Vladimirescu First Volunteer Division, under the command of Colonel Nicolae Cambrea, and the other the Horia, Cloşca şi Crişan Division, under the command of General Mihail Lascăr (who later served as Minister of Defence from 1946 to 1947). These two units formed the nucleus of the new Romanian Land Forces under Soviet control. The postwar reorganisation of the Land Forces included cavalry but the arm disappeared <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> with the disbandment in November 1954 of the 59th Cavalry Division at Oradea.|$|E
5|$|When the Second Boer War {{broke out}} in 1899, {{many members of the}} mounted police wanted to {{volunteer}} to serve in South Africa, motivated by sympathy for the British imperial cause and the strong military tradition within the force. Indeed, Commissioner Herchmer had proposed sending a force of 350 men to join the Sudan campaign in 1896, but was turned down by his superiors. Although there was public enthusiasm for a Canadian military response, at first it appeared that only a minimal deployment would be needed, and it was only after several British defeats that an offer of a more substantive force was welcomed by London. The Canadian government turned to the mounted police as their main source for experienced mounted soldiers, and members were given leave <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> for the duration of their service. Combined with the pressures of maintaining the commitments in the Yukon, this reduced the number of the police in the remaining territories to only 682 men by 1900.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} causes Katarn {{to distance}} himself <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> and return to mercenary missions with Jan Ors. In Jedi Outcast, Ors is captured by Desann, a former pupil of Luke Skywalker who has turned to the Dark Side. Katarn believes Desann to have killed Ors, and so {{he returns to the}} Valley of the Jedi in an attempt to reconnect to the Force so as to stop Desann. Eventually, it is revealed that Ors' death is a ruse by Desann {{for the express purpose of}} having Katarn return to the Valley, so Desann may learn of its location. Desann, in league with the Imperial Remnant, uses the power of the Valley to endow his troops with Force power, before using them to launch an attack on the Jedi Academy. However, Katarn defeats Desann and discovers his true path, becoming a tutor at the Academy. In Jedi Academy, Katarn takes on two students: Jaden Korr and Rosh Penin. The protagonist of the game is Jaden, who is dispatched on various peace-keeping missions across the galaxy, sometimes with Katarn, sometimes alone. Jaden eventually encounters a Sith cult led by Tavion (Desann's former apprentice) who plans to restore the Sith to power by using stolen Force energy to resurrect an ancient Sith Lord, Marka Ragnos. After learning that Rosh has betrayed the Jedi and joined Tavion, Jaden may either kill him and turn to the Dark Side or let him live and remain on the Light Side. If Jaden chooses to free Rosh, he ultimately faces and defeats both Tavion and the spirit of Ragnos. If he chooses the Dark Side, he kills Tavion, fights and defeats (but does not kill) Katarn, and then flees with Tavion's staff, which is capable of absorbing the Force. The game ends with Katarn setting out in pursuit of Jaden.|$|E
