5000|$|The term [...] "gimp" [...] for a braided trim {{has been}} around since the 15th and 16th centuries, when gimp threads were braided into flat braids up to a quarter of an inch (7 mm) wide. The braids were {{sometimes}} made either <b>with</b> <b>bobbins</b> or needle and thread, which gave greater control over the threads. Gimp trim was then sewn down to form designs.|$|R
5000|$|Bobbin lace, as {{the name}} suggests, is made <b>with</b> <b>bobbins</b> and a pillow. The bobbins, turned from wood, bone, or plastic, hold threads which are woven {{together}} and held in place with pins stuck in the pattern on the pillow. The pillow contains straw, preferably oat straw or other materials such as sawdust, insulation styrofoam, or ethafoam. Also known as Bone-lace. Chantilly lace {{is a type of}} bobbin lace.|$|R

5000|$|All {{bobbin lace}} is made <b>with</b> <b>bobbins</b> on a lace pillow. Some styles of lace {{are made in}} a {{continuous}} strip. Since {{there is a limit}} to how many bobbins can be handled on a pillow, this limits how wide the lace is. Part lace, on the other hand, is made in pieces or motifs. Once made, these are joined together in a ground, net or mesh, or with plaits, bars or legs. [...] This means that the lace has no limit in size, apart from the time needed to make it.|$|R

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} corrosion of extruded AA 6005 -T 6 weldments produced <b>with</b> <b>bobbin</b> {{friction stir welding}} (BFSW) using fast and slow process parameters has been analyzed. The weldments of the same material fabricated using conventional FSW were also exposed as reference. Copper-rich phase particles were detected at the grain boundaries in the stir zone of both specimens. It was evident that the BFSW specimens exhibit better corrosion behaviour than the specimens produced using the slow process parameters. An {{effort was made to}} carefully attribute the improved corrosion resistance of the fast BFSW specimens to the difference in the microstructure of the weldments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

60|$|At length a truce being established, {{the king}} came, {{and with him}} near three hundred men; and soon after the queen, with half as many women. They were not stark naked, neither men nor women, but wearing a loose piece of cloth about their middles; what {{it was made of}} we could not imagine, for it was neither linen or woollen, cotton or silk; nor was it woven, but twisted and braided by hand, as our women make bone lace <b>with</b> <b>bobbins.</b> It seems it was the stalk of an herb, which this was made with; and was so strong that I doubt not it would have made cables for our ships, if we had wanted to make such an experiment.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia) produce large, {{indehiscent}} fruits {{that contain}} numerous large seeds. Seed dispersal in this species depends on rodents to dismantle fruits and extract the seeds which they disperse tens of {{meters from the}} source. Using camera trapping and fruits equipped <b>with</b> <b>bobbins,</b> I show that white-tailed antelope squirrels (Ammospermophilus leucurus) and kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) moved intact, fallen fruits 6 to 7 m from trees before opening them. Pocket mice (Chaetodipus fallax and Perognathus longimembris) and pinyon mice (Peromyscus trueii) dismantled fruits in situ and harvested loose seeds but {{did not appear to}} move them. However, they readily harvested loose seeds. Mobilizing fruits may be an important, overlooked step in the seed dispersal process, especially if the fruits are indehiscent. Fruit-carrying behavior of rodents described in this study adds to the dispersal distance of Joshua tree seeds...|$|R

5|$|The Allied Expeditionary Air Force (AEAF) {{undertook}} over 3,200 photo reconnaissance sorties from April 1944 {{until the}} start of the invasion. Photos of the coastline were taken at extremely low altitude to show the invaders the terrain, obstacles on the beach, and defensive structures such as bunkers and gun emplacements. Inland terrain, bridges, troop emplacements, and buildings were also photographed, in many cases from several angles, to give the Allies as much information as possible. Members of Combined Operations Pilotage Parties clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps, including depth soundings.

The material would then be left in place to create a route for more conventional tanks.|$|R
50|$|Between {{the fifteenth}} to the eighteenth centuries, the term Greek lace may have {{originated}} {{from the time}} when the Ionian Islands were in the possession of the Venetian Republic. A true lace is created when a thread is looped, braided, or twisted to other threads independently from a fabric in one of 3 ways: (1) with a needle, when the work is distinctively known as “needlepoint lace” (2) <b>with</b> <b>bobbins,</b> pins on a pillow or cushion, when the work is known as ‘pillow lace” (3) by machinery. Originally, lace was made with linen, silk, gold, or silver threads, but now lace is often made with cotton thread.Ironically, {{there is no evidence to}} prove that Greek Lace was ever produced for commercial purposes in Greece. It is speculated that the term may have originated between the 15th and 18th century, when the Ionian Islands were under the rule of the Venetian Republic.|$|R

50|$|A {{ring frame}} was {{constructed}} from cast iron, and later pressed steel. On {{each side of}} the frame are the spindles, above them are draughting (drafting) rollers and on top is a creel loaded <b>with</b> <b>bobbins</b> of roving. The roving (unspun thread) passes downwards from the bobbins to the draughting rollers. Here the back roller steadied the incoming thread, while the front rollers rotated faster, pulling the roving out and making the fibres more parallel. The rollers are individually adjustable, originally by mean of levers and weights. The attenuated roving now passes through a thread guide that is adjusted to be centred above the spindle. Thread guides are on a thread rail which allows them to be hinged out of the way for doffing or piecing a broken thread. The attenuated roving passes down to the spindle assembly, where it is threaded though a small D ring called the traveller. The traveller moves along the ring. It is this that gives the ring frame its name. From here the thread is attached to the existing thread on the spindle.|$|R

40|$|Fluxgate magnetometers are an {{important}} tool in geophysics and space physics but are typically sensitive to variations in sensor temperature. Changes in instrumental gain with temperature, thermal gain dependence, {{are thought to be}} predominantly due to changes in the geometry of the wire coils that sense the magnetic field and/or provide magnetic feedback. Scientific fluxgate magnetometers typically employ some form of temperature compensation and support and constrain wire sense coils <b>with</b> <b>bobbins</b> constructed from materials such as MACOR machinable ceramic (Corning Inc.) which are selected for their ultra-low thermal deformation rather than for robustness, cost, or ease of manufacturing. We present laboratory results comparing the performance of six geometrically and electrically matched fluxgate sensors in which the material used to support the windings and for the base of the sensor is varied. We use a novel, low-cost thermal calibration procedure based on a controlled sinusoidal magnetic source and quantitative spectral analysis to measure the thermal gain dependence of fluxgate magnetometer sensors at the ppm°C − 1 level in a typical magnetically noisy university laboratory environment. We compare the thermal gain dependence of sensors built from MACOR, polyetheretherketone (PEEK) engineering plastic (virgin, 30...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPeniche's {{bobbin lace}} {{has been a}} victim of the lack of demand for the product and the {{decrease}} of artisans who wish to manufacture it. The Bobbin lace is primarily generated on a small scale and most of the times for personal consumption. Apart from a few occasional orders these are the reasons that still maintain the artisanal production of bobbin lace. Identifying the problem of discontinuity of traditions and the lack of framing of these with contemporaneity arises combined with the remoteness of younger generations. In what design can it contribute to change this mercantile perspective?Getting the lace makers motivated for the production of different types of bobbin lace, using new materials, preserving {{at the same time the}} cultural heritage, it will be, in our opinion, one of the opportunities to reverse its decline status. We also believe on developing contemporary products to appeal the younger consumers, we’ll be capable of doing a direct association <b>with</b> <b>bobbin</b> lace. Therefore, the bobbin lace could be associated to other components outside the textile context by creating objects with materials like iron, plastic or rubber, not merely ornamental, but useful to the eyes of the final consumer. This resignification of the bobbin lace appeals to another meaning, more contemporary than the usual napro...|$|R
