5|$|The strip {{centers on}} the mixed {{marriage}} between a rabbit, Kevin and a <b>grey</b> <b>wolf,</b> Kell Dewclaw. In their society, their major difference is their diet: Kevin is a herbivore and Kell is a carnivore. Their family includes three children: Lindesfarne, a hedgehog adopted from Kevin's first marriage; Rudy, a wolf/fox hybrid born during Kell's first marriage; and their only biological child Coney, a carnivorous rabbit. The comic's plot revolves around species-related humor, satire, and interpersonal conflict.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, <b>grey</b> <b>wolf,</b> golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and beech marten. The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The European pine marten and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals in the rocks and caverns of Silistar.|$|E
5|$|In {{some places}} they are mainly scavengers, feeding on carrion {{as well as}} the {{associated}} maggots and carrion beetles. With large-bodied carrion, which they are not equipped to tear through as well as birds such as hook-billed vultures, they must wait for the prey to be torn open by another predator or flayed by other means. Plant food includes cereal grains, berries and fruit. They prey on small invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and birds. Ravens may also consume the undigested portions of animal feces, and human food waste. They store surplus food items, especially those containing fat, and will learn to hide such food out of the sight of other common ravens. Ravens also raid the food caches of other species, such as the Arctic fox. They sometimes associate with another canine, the <b>grey</b> <b>wolf,</b> as a kleptoparasite, following to scavenge wolf-kills in winter. Ravens are regular predators at bird nests, brazenly picking off eggs, nestlings and sometimes adult birds when they spot an opportunity. They are considered perhaps the primary natural threat to the nesting success of the critically endangered California condor, since they readily take condor eggs and are very common in the areas where the species is being re-introduced.|$|E

25|$|It was {{previously}} classified as an African {{variant of the}} Eurasian golden jackal, {{with at least one}} subspecies (Canis anthus lupaster) having been classified as a <b>grey</b> <b>wolf.</b> In 2015, a series of analyses on the species' mitochondrial DNA and nuclear genome demonstrated that it was in fact distinct from both the golden jackal and the <b>grey</b> <b>wolf,</b> and more closely related to grey wolves and coyotes. It is nonetheless still close enough to the golden jackal to produce hybrid offspring, as indicated through genetic tests on jackals in Israel and a 19th-century captive crossbreeding experiment. As the IUCN's golden jackal page has not been updated since 2008, it has yet to recognise the distinctiveness of the African wolf; thus its conservation status has not been evaluated, and no reliable population estimates are available.|$|E

25|$|The {{vocabulary}} of the African wolf {{is similar to}} that of the domestic dog, with seven sounds having been recorded. The African wolf's vocalisations include howls, barks, growls, whines and cackles. Subspecies can be recognised by differences in their howls. One of the most commonly heard sounds is a high, keening wail, of which there are three varieties; a long single toned continuous howl, a wail that rises and falls, and a series of short, staccato howls. These howls are used to repel intruders and attract family members. Howling in chorus is thought to reinforce family bonds, as well as establish territorial status. A comparative analysis of African wolf and some <b>grey</b> <b>wolf</b> subspecies' howls demonstrated that the former's howls bear similarities to those of the Indian <b>grey</b> <b>wolf,</b> being high pitched and of relatively short duration.|$|E
25|$|Hemprich and Ehrenberg {{gave them}} the {{binomial}} name Canis lupaster in 1832.

25|$|In 1981, {{zoologist}} Walter Ferguson {{argued in}} favour of lupaster being a subspecies of <b>grey</b> <b>wolf</b> based on cranial measurements, stating that the classing of the animal as a jackal was {{based solely on the}} animal's small size, and predated the discovery of C. l. arabs, which is intermediate in size between C. l. lupus and lupaster.|$|E
25|$|A black wolf is a melanistic colour {{variant of}} the <b>grey</b> <b>wolf</b> (Canis lupus). Black {{specimens}} are recorded among red wolves (Canis lupus rufus), and these colour variants are probably still around today. Genetic research from the Stanford University School of Medicine and the University of California, Los Angeles revealed that wolves with black pelts owe their distinctive coloration to a mutation which occurred in domestic dogs, and was carried to wolves through wolf-dog hybridization. Besides coat colour they are normal grey wolves.|$|E

25|$|It {{is one of}} {{the rarest}} and least known native canids in Europe, and is not {{recognised}} as a large carnivore by the Large Carnivore Initiative for Europe (LCIE), despite being {{the same size as the}} Iberian lynx, which is itself classed as such. Though mostly found in scattered populations within Eastern Europe, its range has grown to encompass parts of its former Eastern European range, as well as in Western Europe, which is thought to be attributable to a decline in <b>grey</b> <b>wolf</b> populations.|$|E
25|$|The study {{proposes that}} after having diverged {{from the common}} {{ancestor}} along with the <b>grey</b> <b>wolf,</b> the evolution of Canis familiaris proceeded in three stages. The first was natural selection based on feeding behavior within the ecological niche that had been formed through human activity. The second was artificial selection based on tamability. The third was directed selection based on forming breeds that possessed qualities to help with specific tasks within the human economy. The process commenced 40,000-30,000 YBP with its speed increasing with each stage until domestication became complete.|$|E
25|$|Further doubts {{over its}} being conspecific {{with the golden}} jackal of Eurasia arose in December 2002, when a canid was sighted in Eritrea's Danakil Desert whose {{appearance}} didn't correspond {{to that of the}} golden jackal or the six other recognised species of the area, but strongly resembled that of the <b>grey</b> <b>wolf.</b> The area had previously been largely unexplored because of its harsh climate and embroilment in the Eritrean War of Independence and subsequent Eritrean–Ethiopian War, though local Afar tribesmen knew of the animal, and referred to it as wucharia (wolf).|$|E

25|$|As of 1990, up to 16 {{subspecies}} are recognised, {{which are}} divided into four regional groupings based on skull height and lacrimal bone length. The species lives in matriarchal societies consisting of interrelated females and their young (both male and female). Fully grown males are usually solitary outside the breeding season. The <b>grey</b> <b>wolf</b> is the wild boar's main predator throughout most of its range except in the Far East and the Lesser Sunda Islands, where it is replaced by the tiger and Komodo dragon, respectively.

25|$|Meanwhile, other mammals, {{such as the}} {{population}} of <b>grey</b> <b>wolf</b> (Canis lupus) have collapsed with human encroachment, {{while the number of}} exemplars are limited.

Bears disappeared from the region in the 17th century and the extinct Portuguese ibex (Capra pyrenaica lusitanica), locally known as Gerês goat, was last seen in the 1890s. More than a century later, its vacant ecological niche was reoccupied naturally by Spanish ibexes coming from Galicia, and their population numbered about 100 animals by 2011.|$|E
