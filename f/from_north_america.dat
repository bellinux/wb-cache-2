5|$|Boletus rubroflammeus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and its fruit bodies grow scattered or {{in groups}} on the ground under hardwood trees. The fungus fruits in summer and autumn months, and tends to appear after hot weather and heavy rains. Known only <b>from</b> <b>North</b> <b>America,</b> its range extends from New England south to Tennessee, and west to Michigan. It has also been recorded from Mexico.|$|E
5|$|English cuisine {{encompasses}} the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with England.

5|$|Tarbosaurus is {{classified}} as a theropod in the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae. Other members include Tyrannosaurus and the earlier Daspletosaurus, both <b>from</b> <b>North</b> <b>America,</b> and possibly the Mongolian genus Alioramus. Animals in this subfamily are {{more closely related to}} Tyrannosaurus than to Albertosaurus and are known for their robust build with proportionally larger skulls and longer femurs than in the other subfamily, the Albertosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|This {{widespread}} {{species has}} occurred as a vagrant in many locations in Eurasia outside its normal range, but records <b>from</b> <b>North</b> <b>America</b> are normally considered to involve escapees, including, for example, the 1971 bird in Quebec. However, a 1994 record from Bonavista, Newfoundland, {{has been accepted}} as a genuine wild bird, and the species is therefore on the North American list.|$|E
5|$|A {{fungus gnat}} from New Zealand, Arachnocampa luminosa, {{lives in the}} predator-free {{environment}} of caves and its larvae emit bluish-green light. They dangle silken threads that glow and attract flying insects, and wind in their fishing-lines when prey becomes entangled. The bioluminescence of the larvae of another fungus gnat <b>from</b> <b>North</b> <b>America</b> which lives on streambanks and under overhangs has a similar function. Orfelia fultoni builds sticky little webs and emits light of a deep blue colour. It has an inbuilt biological clock and, even when kept in total darkness, turns its light on and off in a circadian rhythm.|$|E

5|$|Analyses of extinct adapiforms postcranial skeletons {{suggest a}} variety of {{locomotor}} behavior. The European adapids Adapis, Palaeolemur, and Leptadapis shared adaptations for slow climbing like the lorises, although {{they may have been}} quadrupedal runners like small New World monkeys. Both Notharctus and Smilodectes <b>from</b> <b>North</b> <b>America</b> and Europolemur from Europe exhibit limb proportions and joint surfaces comparable to vertical clinging and leaping lemurs, but were not as specialized as indriids for vertical clinging, suggesting that they ran along branches and did not leap as much. Notharctids Cantius and Pronycticebus appear to have been agile arboreal quadrupeds, with adaptations comparable to the brown lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum fungi are mycorrhizal, and {{are usually}} found in {{coniferous}} and mixed woods. Favored tree hosts include members of the Fagaceae and the Pinaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly Europe and North America, but some species are also found in tropical Asia. Harrison identified a dozen new species <b>from</b> <b>North</b> <b>America</b> in the 1960s. Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus recognized 16 European species in his 1975 treatment of the genus, to which H. dianthifolium has been recently added by Loizides and colleagues.|$|E

The Galaxy defeated the Honduran champion Olimpia 3–2 to win the Cup. Schmid was forced to play an atypical squad since the final was held during the MLS off-season while adjustments to the following season's lineup were being made.|$|E

Some critics praised Berg's direction, {{as well as}} the acting, story, visuals and battle sequences, while others derided the film for focusing on its action scenes than on characterization. Lone Survivor grossed over $154 million in box-office revenue worldwide—of which $125 million was <b>from</b> <b>North</b> <b>America.</b> It received two Academy Award nominations for Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing.|$|E
5|$|Lundy has {{attracted}} many vagrant birds, in particular species <b>from</b> <b>North</b> <b>America.</b> The island's bird list totals 317 species. This has {{included the following}} species, each of which represents the sole British record: Ancient murrelet, eastern phoebe and eastern towhee. Records of bimaculated lark, American robin and common yellowthroat were also firsts for Britain (American robin has also occurred two further times on Lundy). Veerys in 1987 and 1997 were Britain's second and fourth records, a Rüppell's warbler in 1979 was Britain's second, an eastern Bonelli's warbler in 2004 was Britain's fourth, and a black-faced bunting in 2001 Britain's third.|$|E
5|$|Morchella importuna is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Morchellaceae {{described}} <b>from</b> <b>North</b> <b>America</b> in 2012. It occurs in gardens, woodchip beds, and other urban settings of northern California and the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. The fungus has also been reported from Turkey, Spain, France, Switzerland, Canada and China, although it is unknown {{whether this is a}} result of accidental introductions. It is considered a choice edible mushroom. The fruit bodies develop a distinctive ladder-like pattern of pits and ridges on the surface of their conical caps.|$|E
