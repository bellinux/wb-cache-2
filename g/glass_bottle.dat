5|$|In June 2015, Apollo Global Management made a {{successful}} offer of around $1.03 {{billion in cash}} to privatise OM Group. Also that month, Apollo won the bidding during an auction for Saint-Gobain’s Verallia <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> manufacturing unit for a rumoured fee of around 2.95 billion.|$|E
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
50|$|The soda {{was also}} {{produced}} in <b>glass</b> <b>bottles,</b> which carried {{the same image}} {{that is on the}} can today. The <b>glass</b> <b>bottled</b> root beer was not as popular as the canned products.|$|R
50|$|Meadow Fresh was {{the last}} company in New Zealand to produce milk in <b>glass</b> <b>bottles.</b> On 30 November 2005, {{production}} of <b>glass</b> <b>bottled</b> milk at their Christchurch production plant ceased, ending this era.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of ascorbic acid, beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol contents was assessed during {{the storage of}} a fortified juice packed in PET or <b>glass</b> <b>bottles.</b> During the course of storage, oxygen transfer rates and partial oxygen pressures were evaluated {{as well as the}} vitamins. During the first month, a decrease of dissolved oxygen was observed for both PET and <b>glass</b> <b>bottles.</b> A strong degradation of ascorbic acid was noted after 3 months of storage (up to 54 at 72 % in <b>glass</b> and PET <b>bottles</b> respectively) and the beta-carotene content was virtually nil after 80 days. The ascorbic acid degradation was clearly stronger in PET comparing to <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> while no difference was observed for beta-carotene between both packaging. However, beta-carotene isomers (13 -cis-beta-carotene and 9 -cis-beta-carotene) were identified and their total concentrations were higher in <b>glass</b> <b>bottles.</b> The degradation reaction scheme of beta-carotene seems to be mainly oxidation in PET bottles and isomerisation and then oxidation in <b>glass</b> <b>bottles.</b> Concerning tocopherol, its limited oxidation may be explained by regenerative action of ascorbic acid. From a nutritional point of view, the juice packed in <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> is more interesting since beta-carotene isomers still have pro-vitamin activity...|$|R
5|$|During rehearsal, Marge {{struggles with}} {{a scene in}} which Blanche is {{supposed}} to break a <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> and attack Stanley, but she cannot muster enough anger towards Stanley to break the bottle. After coming home, Marge asks Homer to help her learn her lines, but Homer is uninterested. The day before the performance, Marge and Ned are again practising the bottle scene as Homer arrives to drive Marge home. Homer repeatedly interrupts the rehearsal. Imagining that Stanley is Homer, Marge finally smashes the bottle and lunges at Ned.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, a safe was {{discovered}} during excavations of a burial trench at the Hanford nuclear site. Inside the safe were various items, including a large <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> containing a whitish slurry which was subsequently {{identified as the}} oldest sample of weapons-grade plutonium known to exist. Isotope analysis by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory indicated that the plutonium in the bottle was manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge during 1944.|$|E
5|$|High-quality {{glass from}} Roman {{manufacturers}} in Alexandria and Syria was exported to {{many parts of}} Asia, including Han China. The first Roman glassware discovered in China is a blue soda-lime glass bowl dating to the early 1st century BC and excavated from a Western Han tomb in the southern port city of Guangzhou, which may have come there via the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Other Roman glass items include a mosaic-glass bowl found in a prince's tomb near Nanjing dated to 67 AD and a <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> with opaque white streaks found in an Eastern Han tomb of Luoyang. Roman and Persian glassware {{has been found in}} a 5th-century AD tomb of Gyeongju, Korea, capital of ancient Silla, east of China. Roman glass beads have been discovered as far as Japan, within the 5th-century AD Kofun-era Utsukushi burial mound near Kyoto.|$|E

50|$|Containers {{thereafter}} {{continued to}} develop along with related advances in human technology, {{and with the}} development of new materials and new means of manufacture. Early <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> were produced by the Phoenicians; specimens of Phoenician translucent and transparent <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> have been found in Cyprus and Rhodes generally varying in length from three to six inches. These Phoenician examples from the first millennium BC were thought to have been used to contain perfume. The Romans learned glass-making from the Phoenicians and produced many extant examples of fine <b>glass</b> <b>bottles,</b> mostly relatively small. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, sizes for retail containers such as <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> had become standardized for their markets.|$|R
5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} premièred on August 26, 2010 on Vevo, and was {{directed}} by Hiro Murai. The video begins in a club environment, with misplaced furniture and a shattered <b>glass</b> <b>bottle.</b> The scene goes in reverse motion, people instantly appear, frozen in a raving action. As the scene is still reversing a DJ is spinning his booth, and the shattered <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> forms into its original state, the clubbers and the scene then start to move in forward but slow motion and the song begins with Usher approaching from a set of stairs. Usher sings and dances, whilst moving past clubbers who are still moving in slow motion whilst he is in moving normally. Once the chorus comes in, the clubbers begin dancing and raving in normal motion, periodically slowing down; Usher is krumping pass them, {{moving on to the}} next scene. Usher slides into a room with a large lit up window as a back drop. He performs choreography backed-up by female dancers for the second verse, and then returns to the original room with the second chorus coming in. A similar scene is involved to the first chorus, but this time Usher is dancing with the clubbers, who are still alternating in motion speed. Pitbull then begins his verse, and is sat in a V.I.P. area with three females, with the camera alternating between him, the clubbers and Usher. The video ends with its final scene, in a dance off, with Usher dancing adjacent to some of the clubbers. Once the climax of the chorus comes in, Usher jumps in the air and starts freely dancing along with the clubbers, with everyone in the same motion speed; Usher is primarily crip-walking. Usher and the clubbers then perform a final organised choreography, mainly krumping, and the video ends.|$|E
5|$|Alonso made a {{complaint}} about Hamilton and asked {{his team to}} work with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile race director Charlie Whiting to discuss the issue with the safety car. Massa attempted to pass Liuzzi around the outside heading into turn 17 but Liuzzi turned right to defend the position. Shortly afterwards, Massa made a slight mistake which allowed Alguersuari to close the gap. Hamilton started to conserve fuel and prepare for a late attack on lap 20. On the following lap, it was announced Hamilton would be investigated by the stewards for his safety car overtake for which he was given a drive-through penalty which he served on the 27th lap. He remained in second position due to Kobayashi holding {{up the rest of the}} field. Massa placed further pressure upon Liuzzi but was unable to pass him. A <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> appeared on the outside of the track on lap 28 which was retrieved by a marshal three laps later to allow racing to continue unaffected. Massa made an error at the final turn on lap 35 which meant he fell behind Liuzzi in the battle for 14th place.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{subsequent}} setbacks {{in their}} relationship, such as Jac briefly deceiving Joseph {{into believing that}} she is pregnant with his child, Faye and Joseph marry. On {{the day of the}} ceremony, Linden confesses to Faye that he is in love with her, and they kiss. She instantly regrets it, however, and tells him that she loves Joseph. When Archie's nurse Lauren later accidentally administers him the wrong drug, he dies. Faye and Joseph grow apart in the aftermath and she develops romantic feelings for Linden. She and Joseph separate, but after she begins a relationship with Linden, she discovers that she is pregnant with Joseph's baby. Increasingly concerned that Faye may be a pathological liar, Linden terminates their relationship.

She initially fails to bond with him, but when Joseph puts their divorce proceedings on hold, she makes an effort and names him Harry, after Joseph's deceased brother. Despite Joseph's opposition, she insists on returning to the psychiatric unit. Jac's support during this time results in a renewal of their relationship, and when Faye secretly makes plans to leave the country with Harry, Jac helps convince her to leave the baby with Joseph. Joseph struggles as a working father, and accepts a job as a GP in Penrith. Jac declines his offer to accompany him, so he departs with Harry, leaving her in tears.|$|E

25|$|The first <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> {{packaging}} {{for milk}} {{was used in}} the 1870s. The first company to do so may have been the New York Dairy Company in 1877. The Express Dairy Company in England began <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> production in 1880. In 1884, Hervey Thatcher, an American inventor from New York, invented a glass milk bottle, called 'Thatcher's Common Sense Milk Jar', which was sealed with a waxed paper disk. Later, in 1932, plastic-coated paper milk cartons were introduced commercially.|$|E

25|$|Beverage bottles were {{recycled}} with a refundable deposit at some drink manufacturers in Great Britain and Ireland around 1800, notably Schweppes. An official recycling system with refundable deposits {{was established in}} Sweden for bottles in 1884 and aluminum beverage cans in 1982; the law led to a recycling rate for beverage containers of 84–99 percent depending on type, and a <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> can be refilled over 20 times on average.|$|E
25|$|The first commercially {{successful}} <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> {{blowing machine}} was an automatic model introduced in 1905. The machine, {{operated by a}} two-man crew working 12-hour shifts, could produce 17,280 bottles in 24 hours, compared to 2,880 bottles made by a crew of six men and boys working in a shop for a day. The cost of making bottles by machine was 10 to 12 cents per gross compared to $1.80 per gross by the manual glassblowers and helpers.|$|E
25|$|The {{progress}} of the glass industry (especially {{from the use of}} coal) helped to democratize the use of the <b>glass</b> <b>bottle.</b> The production of sparkling wine increased dramatically and spread to the American continent.
