Hallowell determined that his only option was to attempt to drive though those ships of Ganteaume's division that blocked his passage to leeward, the ships of the line Indivisible (under Pierre-Paulin Gourrège) and Dix-Août (under Louis-Marie Le Gouardin) and the frigate Créole.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} strengthened slightly {{further to}} a peak intensity of 80mph (130km/h) by 00:00UTC on September 2.

Hermine became the first hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma on October 24, 2005. Within four hours of landfall, the winds dropped below hurricane force as the appearance on radar imagery degraded. The convection diminished while Hermine crossed into Georgia, with the strongest winds near the Atlantic coast. The center elongated as it continued quickly northeastward ahead of the trough. With the convection <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circulation, Hermine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 12:00UTC on September3 as it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Dry air wrapped into the eastward-moving center, while convection pulsed north of the former hurricane, possibly due to the warmer waters of the Gulf Stream. By September5, the system devolved into several rotating circulations as the overall system slowed {{and turned to the}} northwest, steered by a ridge to the north. The convection began waning on the next day, as the storm turned due westward. At 18:00UTC on September6, the NHC ceased issuing advisories on the post-tropical cyclone as Hermine continued to weaken, due to cooler waters and convective instability. The remnants continued to meander offshore New Jersey and Long Island, until dissipating near Chatham, Massachusetts, late on September8.|$|E
