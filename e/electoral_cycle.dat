The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the Socialist Party, won the subsequent 1994 elections. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in 1998 and 2002; each <b>electoral</b> <b>cycle,</b> the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected. Like most other post-communist European states, however, Hungary broadly pursued an integrationist agenda, joining NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004.

40|$|This article {{examines}} <b>electoral</b> <b>cycles</b> in legislative budget decisions. Where local structures {{play an important}} role in candidate selection and election, legislators' incentives to amend the executive spending proposal can depend on the proximity of elections, leading to more spendthrift behavior in the run-up to popular votes. However, stringent budget institutions can counteract this tendency. Using a unique dataset of executive spending proposals and approved budgets in Sweden, I find strong empirical support for these predictions. Future studies of <b>electoral</b> <b>cycles</b> should pay greater attention to separating the contributions of the legislative and executive stages of the budgetary process and the conditions that foster electoral cyclicality in legislatures...|$|R

We interpret this evidence as a type of misgovernance which arises from <b>electoral</b> <b>cycles</b> in two types of incumbent incentives: (i) to allocate effort or attention between governing vs. campaigning; and/or (ii) to adopt even very inefficient redistributive policies if they benefit special interests with a lead over when the costs are observed.

40|$|Abstract: We explore whether {{effective}} checks and balances, {{measured by the}} presence of veto players in countries with high compliance with the law, moderate <b>electoral</b> <b>cycles</b> in fiscal and monetary policy. Annual data from 39 Latin American and OECD countries over the 1980 - 2005 period show that the aggregate budget surplus (our fiscal variable) and the rate of change of international reserves (our monetary variable) fall significantly before elections and rise afterwards only in Latin America, not in the OECD. Quarterly data allow to identify the electoral period much more precisely, suggesting the presence of cycles in the OECD. Moreover, our measure of institutional constraints on executive discretion turns out to be significant in explaining variations in <b>electoral</b> <b>cycles</b> across regions. Quarterly data show that {{effective checks}} and balances are significant in moderating fiscal and monetary cycles in both regions...|$|R
