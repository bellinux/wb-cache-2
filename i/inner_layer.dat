5|$|Breeding pairs {{must have}} a {{territory}} of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an <b>inner</b> <b>layer</b> of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of intertube van der Waals {{interaction}} on the stability of pristine and covalently functionalized carbon nanotubes under axial compression, using molecular mechanics simulations. After regulating the number of <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> of the armchair four-walled (5, 5) 10, 10) 15, 15) 20, 20) and zigzag four-walled (, 0) 1, 0) 2, 0) 3, 0) carbon nanotubes, the critical buckling strains of the corresponding tubes are calculated. The results show {{that each of the}} three <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> in the functionalized armchair nanotube noticeably contributes to the stability of the outermost tube, and together increase the critical strain amplitude by 155 %. However, the three <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> in the corresponding pristine nanotube, taken together, increase the critical strain of the outermost tube by only 23 %. In addition, for both the pristine and functionalized zigzag nanotubes, only the (2, 0) layer, among the three <b>inner</b> <b>layers,</b> contributes to the critical strain of the corresponding outermost tube, by 11 % and 29 %, respectively. The underlying mechanism of the enhanced stability related to nanotube chirality and functionalization is analyzed in detail...|$|R

5|$|S.iniae has {{occasionally}} produced {{infection in}} humans, especially fish handlers of Asian descent. Human infections include sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, and {{inflammation of the}} skin, intervertebral discs, or <b>inner</b> <b>layer</b> of the heart. Identifying S.iniae in the laboratory can be difficult, since the conventional methods used to identify streptococci yield insufficient results. It cannot be grouped by the Lancefield antigen method typically used to categorize Streptococcus species. The two known serotypes can be distinguished biochemically by differences in enzyme activity. Several antibiotics {{have been used to}} treat S.iniae infections.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed {{breeding}} season begins in February and reaches an apex between March and May; however, new fledglings {{have been recorded}} as late as August. Dates vary within its range due to temperature and rainfall. Nests are generally built at conspicuous locations, the cholla being favored. Other potential nesting sites range from mesquite, prickly pear or yucca to the occasional oak and pine trees. The nest is generally a deep cup but can be flat with a depression for the eggs. The outer layer consists of thorny twigs while the <b>inner</b> <b>layer</b> includes smooth sticks, roots, coarse and fine grasses, rootlets or hair.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer layer}} of the {{epidermis}} (outer skin) consists of: sensory cells; cells that secrete mucus, which protects the body; and interstitial cells, which can transform into other types of cell. In specialized {{parts of the body}} the outer layer also contains colloblasts, found along the surface of tentacles and used in capturing prey, or cells bearing multiple large cilia, for locomotion.

Nevertheless, the {{contamination of}} <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> of the sample with synthetic resin had been tested as well. The infrared spectra of these layers are not distorted with strong vibration bands of synthetic resin (the concordance of these with the infrared spectra of <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> of the sample KBr is more than 92 % on the average, where the concordance between first layers is only 78 % on the average). On the contrary, the use of liquid glass and Herkules as a barrier method can show a higher smearing effect on the contamination of surface of the sample than the synthetic resin.|$|R
5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the <b>inner</b> <b>layer.</b> During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{actively}} seek to hide by decorating {{themselves with}} {{materials such as}} twigs, sand, or pieces of shell from their environment, to break up their outlines, to conceal the features of their bodies, and to match their backgrounds. For example, a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case and lives almost entirely inside it; a decorator crab covers its back with seaweed, sponges and stones. The nymph of the predatory masked bug uses its hind legs and a 'tarsal fan' to decorate its body with sand or dust. There are two layers of bristles (trichomes) over the body. On these, the nymph spreads an <b>inner</b> <b>layer</b> of fine particles and an outer layer of coarser particles. The camouflage may conceal the bug from both predators and prey.|$|E
5|$|The insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, {{is made up}} of two layers: the epicuticle, {{which is}} a thin and waxy water {{resistant}} outer layer and contains no chitin, and a lower layer called the procuticle. The procuticle is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers: an outer layer known as the exocuticle and an <b>inner</b> <b>layer</b> known as the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and hardened. The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects (e.g., caterpillars), especially during their larval stages.|$|E
30|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the gradient nanomechanical behavior of dental fluorosis enamel and provide appropriate selection criteria for restorative materials. The nanomechanical properties of the outer, middle, and <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> of normal tooth enamel, mild dental fluorosis enamel, and severe dental fluorosis enamel were tested by nanoindentation under an applied load of 2000  μN and holding time of 30  s. The nanotribological properties were then evaluated through nanoscratch tests under an applied load of 1000  μN. In addition, the nanotribological property of the outer layer of dental fluorosis enamel was {{compared with that of}} four restorative materials, namely, lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD), polymer-infiltrated-ceramic network (PICN), composite resin block (Lava™ ultimate), and conventional composite resin (Fltek™ Z 350 XT). The nanohardness and elastic modulus of mild dental fluorosis enamel increased from the outer to the middle layers and then decreased from the middle to the <b>inner</b> <b>layers.</b> By contrast, the changed displacement, friction coefficient, and nanoscratch depth and width decreased from the outer to the middle layers and then increased from the middle to the <b>inner</b> <b>layers.</b> In severe dental fluorosis enamel, nanohardness and elastic modulus increased from the outer to the <b>inner</b> <b>layers,</b> but the changed displacement, friction coefficient, and nanoscratch depth and width decreased from the outer to the <b>inner</b> <b>layers.</b> The nanoscratch depth and width of Lava™ ultimate were {{similar to those of the}} outer layer of the mild dental fluorosis enamel. The gradient nanomechanical behavior of dental fluorosis enamel significantly differed from that of normal tooth enamel. Dental materials with a wear resistance similar to that of the opposing enamel are a good choice for restoring dental fluorosis (trial registration: WCHSIRB-D- 2014 - 126, registered 25 December 2014).|$|R
40|$|Background: Alopecia {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} hair follicle (HF) disorders, which is divided into scarring (cicatricial) and nonscarring (noncicatricial) types. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of stem cell (SC) markers such as cytokeratin (CK) 17 and CK 19 in scarring and nonscarring alopecia. Materials and Methods: Thirty patients with scalp alopecia (15 with scarring alopecia and 15 without) together with ten healthy volunteers were included in this study. Biopsies were taken from all participants and stained for CK 17 and CK 19 using immunohistochemistry. Results: There was a statistically significant difference between the nonscarring group and the control group with regard to CK 17 expression in the outer layers of the HFs (P = 0. 00) and CK 19 staining of the <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> of the HFs (P = 0. 008). There was a statistically significant difference between the scarring and the control groups regarding CK 17 expression in the outer (P = 0. 00) and the <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> (P = 0. 00) of the HFs and CK 19 expression in the <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> of the HFs (P = 0. 00). CK 17 expression in the outer layers (P = 0. 02) and the <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> of the HFs (P = 0. 00) together with CK 19 expression in the <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> of the HFs (P = 0. 00) showed statistically significant differences between scarring and nonscarring alopecia groups. Conclusions: The presence of SC markers (CK 17 and CK 19) in the HFs was affected in both scarring and nonscarring alopecia, but the defect in scarring alopecia is more evident than that of nonscarring alopecia. The persistence of SC markers in some types of scarring alopecia could give a hope for the recovery of these lesions. Further studies are recommended to clarify the benefit from using HF SCs in the treatment of alopecia...|$|R
50|$|The {{start point}} is a single steel tube of {{internal}} diameter slightly less than the desired calibre. The tube is subjected to internal pressure of sufficient magnitude to enlarge the bore {{and in the process}} the <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> of the metal are stretched in tension beyond their elastic limit. This means that the <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> have been stretched to a point where the steel is no longer able to return to its original shape once the internal pressure has been removed. Although the outer layers of the tube are also stretched, the degree of internal pressure applied during the process is such that they are not stretched beyond their elastic limit. The reason why this is possible is that the stress distribution through the walls of the tube is non-uniform. Its maximum value occurs in the metal adjacent to the source of pressure, decreasing markedly towards the outer layers of the tube. The strain is proportional to the stress applied within elastic limit; therefore the expansion at the outer layers is less than at the bore. Because the outer layers remain elastic they attempt to return to their original shape; however, they are prevented from doing so completely by the now permanently stretched <b>inner</b> <b>layers.</b> The effect is that the <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> of the metal are put under compression by the outer layers {{in much the same way}} as though an outer layer of metal had been shrunk on as with a built-up gun. The next step is to subject the compressively strained <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> to a low temperature heat treatment which results in the elastic limit being raised to at least the autofrettage pressure employed in the first stage of the process. Finally the elasticity of the barrel can be tested by applying internal pressure once more, but this time care is taken to ensure that the <b>inner</b> <b>layers</b> are not stretched beyond their new elastic limit. The end result is an inner surface of the gun barrel with a residual compressive stress able to counterbalance the tensile stress that would be induced when the gun is discharged. In addition the material has a higher tensile stress as a result of the heat treatment process.|$|R
5|$|The {{muscles and}} nerves are much simpler {{than those of}} most other animals, {{although}} more specialised than in other cnidarians, such as corals. Cells in the outer layer (epidermis) and the <b>inner</b> <b>layer</b> (gastrodermis) have microfilaments that group into contractile fibers. These fibers are not true muscles {{because they are not}} freely suspended in the body cavity as they are in more developed animals. Longitudinal fibres are found in the tentacles and oral disc, and also within the mesenteries, where they can contract the whole length of the body. Circular fibers are found in the body wall and, in some species, around the oral disc, allowing the animal to retract its tentacles into a protective sphincter.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} to have been {{protected}} with Krupp and Wotan, Hart ("Wotan", Hard) armor plating. The class decks were 20mm thick, with 35mm thick sloped deck. The conning tower had a roof that was 50mm thick and sides 100mm thick. The <b>inner</b> <b>layer</b> of the armor belt was 50mm thick in critical areas amidships, and tapered down to zero protection at the stern and bow. The outer layer was 30mm amidships; it too tapered down to nothing {{at both ends of}} the ships. The gun turrets had the same armor protection as the preceding light cruiser : the sides were 35mm thick, the faces were 80mm thick, the roofs ranged in thickness from 2035mm. The armor protecting the turret barbettes was 60mm thick.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the <b>inner</b> <b>layer),</b> {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E

5|$|The {{microstructure}} of Gobioolithus eggshell has {{not been}} thoroughly studied, and heavy recrystallization of most specimens {{makes it difficult to}} examine the eggshell structure or pore system. The eggshell consists of two (or possibly three) structural layers. The <b>inner</b> <b>layer,</b> called the mammillary layer, is about half the thickness of the outer, or continuous, layer. On the outside, many specimens have a recrystallized outer layer. This could simply due to diagenesis or it could be a true external zone, which is a third layer present in most bird eggs but is rare in non-avian dinosaurs. However, a few specimens are unaffected by recrystallization. These do not have a third layer, but this does not {{rule out the possibility that}} the eggshell originally had a three layers since the external layer can easily separate from the rest of the eggshell. These specimens also reveal an angusticanaliculate pore system, which means that the pores have a low density, and are long, narrow, and straight.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid sits {{near the}} front of the neck, lying against and around the front of the larynx and trachea. The thyroid {{cartilage}} and cricoid cartilage lie just above the gland, below the Adam's apple. The isthmus extends from the second to third rings of the trachea, with the uppermost part of the lobes extending to the thyroid cartilage, and the lowermost around the fourth to sixth tracheal rings. The thyroid gland is covered by a thin fibrous capsule, which has an inner and an outer layer. The outer layer is continuous with the pretracheal fascia, attaching the gland to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, via a thickening of the fascia to form the posterior suspensory ligament of thyroid gland also known as Berry's ligament. This causes the thyroid to move up and down with swallowing. The <b>inner</b> <b>layer</b> extrudes into the gland and forms the septae that divides the thyroid tissue into microscopic lobules. Typically four parathyroid glands, two on each side, lie on each side between the two layers of the capsule, {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes.|$|E
5|$|The hoof of {{the horse}} {{contains}} over a dozen different structures, including bones, cartilage, tendons and tissues. The coffin or pedal bone is the major hoof bone, supporting {{the majority of the}} weight. Under the coffin bone is the navicular bone, itself cushioned by the navicular bursa, a fluid-filled sac. The digital cushion is a blood vessel-filled structure located {{in the middle of the}} hoof, which assists with blood flow throughout the leg. At the top of the hoof wall is the corium, tissue which continually produces the horn of the outer hoof shell, which is in turn protected by the periople, a thin outer layer which prevents the interior structures from drying out. The wall is connected to the coffin bone by sensitive laminae, a flexible layer which helps to suspend and protect the coffin bone. The main tendon in the hoof is the deep digital flexor tendon, which connects to the bottom of the coffin bone. The impact zone on the bottom of the hoof includes the sole, which has an outer, insensitive layer and a sensitive <b>inner</b> <b>layer,</b> and the frog, which lies between the heels and assists in shock absorption and blood flow. The final structures are the lateral cartilages, connected to the upper coffin bone, which act as the flexible heels, allowing hoof expansion. These structures allow the hoof to perform many functions. It acts as a support and traction point, shock absorber and system for pumping blood back through the lower limb.|$|E

5|$|Woodpeckers {{have strong}} bills for {{drilling}} and drumming on trees, and long sticky tongues for extracting food. Woodpecker bills are typically longer, sharper {{and stronger than}} the bills of piculets and wrynecks; however, their morphology is very similar. The bill's chisel-like tip is kept sharp by the pecking action in birds that regularly use it on wood. The beak consists of three layers; an outer sheath called rhamphotheca, made of scales formed from keratin proteins, an <b>inner</b> <b>layer</b> of bone which has a large cavity and mineralised collagen fibers, and a middle layer made of porous bone which connects the two other layers. Combined, this anatomy helps the beak absorb mechanical stress. Species of woodpecker and flicker that use their bills in soil or for probing as opposed to regular hammering tend to have longer and more decurved bills. Due to their smaller bill size, many piculets and wrynecks will forage in decaying wood more often than woodpeckers. The long sticky tongues, which possess bristles, aid these birds in grabbing and extracting insects from deep within a hole in a tree. It {{has been reported that}} the tongue was used to spear grubs, but more detailed studies published in 2004 have shown that the tongue instead wraps around the prey before being pulled out.|$|E
