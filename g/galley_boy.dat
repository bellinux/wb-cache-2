25|$|Empire Morn {{is known}} {{for the death of}} the second {{youngest}} person in the British services to die in the war, 14-year-old <b>galley</b> <b>boy</b> Raymond Steed. She is also the only CAM ship whose fighter pilot died in action after his aircraft was launched from the ship.|$|E
25|$|Empire Morn {{shifted to}} warmer waters the {{following}} year, and in April 1943 she joined convoy OS/KMS 46 bound for Gibraltar via Casablanca. She {{was carrying a}} cargo of equipment destined for naval, army and RAF forces. She arrived at Casablanca on 25 April 1943, and then set off for Gibraltar, and on 26 April 1943, at , she struck a mine that had been laid by U-117 on 10 April. A secondary explosion damaged the stern and blew out much of the crew accommodation. When the order was given to abandon ship, a head count of crew found 21 men missing. Among them was the 14-year old <b>galley</b> <b>boy</b> Raymond Steed. Steed's body was found two days later, and he became the second youngest person in the British services {{to die in the}} war. He was 14 years and 207 days old. It was thought that he was the youngest wartime service casualty until February 2010, when it was confirmed Reginald Earnshaw was actually younger, at 14 years and 152 days. The damaged Empire Morn was towed back into Casablanca, where she was expected to be declared a total constructive loss. She was however refloated and towed to Gibraltar, eventually arriving on 1 September 1943.|$|E
2500|$|Raymond Victor Steed (1 October 1928 [...] 26 April 1943) was {{the second}} {{youngest}} British services recruit to die during the Second World War. He was just 14 years and 207 days old when the ship on which he was a <b>galley</b> <b>boy,</b> SS Empire Morn, was blown up after it hit a U-boat mine on 26 April 1943.

50|$|The {{majority}} of seamen manning ships of the British Merchant Navy were British however in a 1938 survey {{it was found}} that 27 percent were either from India or China and another 5 percent were British domiciled Arabs, Indians, Chinese, West Africans or West Indians mainly resident in major UK ports such as Cardiff, Liverpool or South Shields.A review of a typical crew sailing aboard a typical British coal burning general cargo steamer in May 1940 revealed:-The deck officers came from northern Scotland, South Wales, Portsmouth and Liverpool. The engineer officers were from Jarrow, Hull, Liverpool and the Netherlands. The engineroom crew were mainly South Shields resident Somali Arabs. The deck crew consisted of UK resident Indians, one man from Burma (Myanmar), one from Fiji, a West Indian, a Chinese and a Liverpudlian. The chief steward was from Cardiff, the cook and two <b>galley</b> <b>boys</b> were from Liverpool. The oldest member of the crew was the 55 year old cook and the youngest was the 15 year old galley boy.Records show that men from all British Commonwealth countries and most Scandinavian, Baltic and European countries served aboard British registered vessels and until the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor there were Japanese seamen amongst crews, several of whom were killed in U-boat attacks serving beside British seamen, and others such as Kenji Takaki were captured and interned with British seamen at Marlag-Milag.|$|R
60|$|To {{the great}} {{satisfaction}} {{of himself and}} Gervaise, Ralph Harcourt was nominated lieutenant of the galley. The {{fact that so many}} had volunteered impressed all those who were chosen with the sense that it was at once an honour and a piece of good fortune to be selected, and all were determined that the <b>boy</b> <b>galley,</b> as the elder knights laughingly termed it, should do honour to the Order.|$|R

60|$|The {{deck of the}} Pyrenees {{was making}} more smoke than on the {{preceding}} day, and the cheerfulness of officers and crew had vanished. In the lee of the <b>galley</b> the cabin <b>boy</b> could be heard whimpering. It was his first voyage, {{and the fear of}} death was at his heart. The captain wandered about like a lost soul, nervously chewing his mustache, scowling, unable to make up his mind what to do.|$|R
5000|$|Here are {{the words}} of Duke Antoine de Gramont who was with the Polish-Tatar army during the {{campaign}} of King John Casimir on the Left Bank Ukraine in 1663-1664 when, according to him, about 20,000 were captured. [...] "The Tatars slit the throats of all men over 60 years old who {{were thought to be}} incapable of work, forty-year-olds were saved for the <b>galleys,</b> young <b>boys</b> for their pleasure and girls and women to continue their kind and then later to be sold. The prisoners were divided equally and lots were cast according to age so that no one could complain that he had gotten more old ones than young. To their credit I must say that they were not stingy with their booty and with extreme politeness offered it to all who came their way." ...|$|R

5000|$|After {{joining the}} Merchant Navy {{for a while}} (serving as a <b>galley</b> <b>boy</b> and {{developing}} an interest in marine biology and maritime history), Phillips travelled widely in Europe, to Sweden, Switzerland, France and Italy. Caught up in the protest movements of the late 1960s, he took photographs of the student riots in Paris and Rome.

50|$|The {{larger the}} ship, {{the larger the}} Catering department. Aboard a general cargo ship all matters of victualing/catering from food, {{cleaning}} of officers cabins and supplies of food and drink were managed by a Chief Steward. He would usually {{have two or three}} Assistant Stewards reporting to him. Also reporting to him was a Chief Cook (senior Petty Officer status) with his Assistants and a <b>Galley</b> <b>Boy,</b> one of his assistants was usually an efficient baker. On a long voyage food became the centre of attention for the crew and a cook unable to produce food which was considered acceptable would very quickly become seriously unpopular.|$|E

The Empire Larch was a Deep Sea Tug owned by the British Ministry of War Transport and engaged in war work (assembling the convoy of block-ships for Operation Corn Cob) in {{preparation}} for the invasion of France.
