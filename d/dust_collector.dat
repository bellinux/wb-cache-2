2500|$|On 10 October 2005, NASA 928 {{flew from}} Ellington Field via CFB Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador to RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk, England {{arriving}} {{during the evening}} of 11 October 2005. The WB-57F then flew four missions out of Mildenhall at up to [...] in UK airspace collecting [...] "cosmic dust". The Cosmic <b>Dust</b> <b>Collector</b> (CDC) mission uses two small metallic rectangular boxes carried under each wing {{that are designed to}} open at altitude and collect [...] "interplanetary dust particles", or in other words the remains of small meteorites or rocks from space that accumulate in the upper atmosphere, on an adhesive strip. At the end of the assigned track the boxes then automatically close at high altitude and after landing the adhesive strip is removed and returned to the U.S. for analysis. The missions also allowed the WB-57F crews to validate new radios and avionics and ensure these could interface correctly with European ATC agencies. There was also an unconfirmed report that the aircraft also supported a UK MoD assessment of future sensors for UAV applications in a European environment by carrying the sensors in its pallet under the fuselage.|$|E

50|$|A <b>dust</b> <b>collector</b> is {{a system}} used to {{enhance the quality of}} air {{released}} from industrial and commercial processes by collecting dust and other impurities from air or gas.

50|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>collectors</b> {{are used}} in many {{processes}} to either recover valuable granular solid or powder from process streams, or to remove granular solid pollutants from exhaust gases prior to venting to the atmosphere. Dust collection is an online process for collecting any process-generated dust from the source point on a continuous basis. <b>Dust</b> <b>collectors</b> may be of single unit construction, or a collection of devices used to separate particulate matter from the process air. They are often used as an air pollution control device to maintain or improve air quality.|$|R

Most hoppers are made of steel.|$|R
