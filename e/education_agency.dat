5|$|Between 2006 and 2007, Texas spent $7,275 {{per pupil}} ranking it below the {{national}} average of $9,389. The pupil/teacher ratio was 14.9, {{below the national}} average of 15.3. Texas paid instructors $41,744, {{below the national average}} of $46,593. The Texas <b>Education</b> <b>Agency</b> (TEA) administers the state's public school systems. Texas has over 1,000 school districts- all districts except the Stafford Municipal School District are independent from municipal government and many cross city boundaries. School districts have the power to tax their residents and to assert eminent domain over privately owned property. Due to court-mandated equitable school financing for school districts, the state has a controversial tax redistribution system called the"Robin Hood plan". This plan transfers property tax revenue from wealthy school districts to poor ones. The TEA has no authority over private or home school activities.|$|E
