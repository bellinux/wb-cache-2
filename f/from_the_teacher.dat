5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher.</b> They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E

25|$|The goal of guided {{instruction}} in the gradual release of responsibility model is to guide students toward using different skills, strategies and procedures independently. The student will assume more responsibility with less support <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher.</b> Lessons are created as to ensure student success. Oftentimes when students are struggling with a concept in the classroom, {{they do not need}} more teacher modelling, what they really need is guidance and support to meet high expectations.|$|E
25|$|A common {{misconception}} {{was that}} reform educators {{did not want}} children to learn the standard methods of arithmetic. As the NCTM Focal Points made clear, such methods were still the ultimate goal, but reformers believed that conceptual understanding should come first. Reform educators believed that such understanding is best pursued by allowing children at first to solve problems using their own understanding and methods. Under guidance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> students eventually arrive at an understanding of standard methods. Even the controversial NCTM Standards of 1989 did not call for abandoning standard algorithms, but instead recommended a decreased emphasis on complex paper-and-pencil computation drills and greater attention to mental computation, estimation skills, thinking strategies for mastering basic facts and conceptual understanding of arithmetic operations.|$|E

500|$|Thus, {{from the}} age of eight, Mao was sent to gain a basic {{education}} at the private Shaoshan Primary School. Adopting a traditional syllabus and method of education, the school emphasised the copying and recitation by rote of a series of classical Chinese texts preaching Confucian morals: the Three Character Classic, the Book of Names, the Thousand Character Classic, the Odes for Children, the Filial Classic, and Filial Learning. Perceived failure or disobedience resulted in beatings with a bamboo rod <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> who like Mao's father was a stern disciplinarian. Disliking this mode of education, Mao later asserted that [...] "I hated Confucius {{from the age}} of eight." [...] Although expressing his dislike for them, Mao nevertheless accepted the utility of learning these texts, finding himself able to win arguments [...] including those against his father [...] by the selective use of Confucian quotations.|$|E
2500|$|Collaborative {{learning}} {{is the third}} component of the gradual release of responsibility model where students work in small heterogeneous groups on activities {{that allow them to}} deepen their understanding through application of the concept being learned. [...] This stage of the model {{is the beginning of the}} transfer of responsibility <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> to the students. [...] The collaborative learning component requires that each student is accountable for their participation by producing an independent product while engaged with his peers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gradual release}} of {{responsibility}} model or GRR {{model is a}} particular style of teaching which is a structured method of pedagogy framed around a process devolving responsibility within the learning process <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> to the eventual independence of the learner. This instructional model requires that the teacher, by design, transitions from assuming [...] "all the responsibility for performing a task...to {{a situation in which}} the students assume all of the responsibility". The ideal result is a confident learner who accepts responsibility for their own learning and directs this learning through the cognitive processes involved, moving through the academic spectrum, to independent choice (personalised learning). As Buehl (2005) stated, the GRR model [...] "emphasizes instruction that mentors students into becoming capable thinkers and learners when handling the tasks with which they have not yet developed expertise".|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} uses for {{podcasting}} for the classroom. They {{can be used}} to convey instructional information <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> or trainer, motivational stories, and auditory case studies. [...] Podcasts can also be used by the learners as artifacts and evidence of learning; for example, a student might prepare a brief podcast as a summary of a concept in lieu of writing an essay. [...] Podcasts can also be used as a means of self-reflection on the learning processes or products. Podcasts can help keep students on the same page, including those that are absent! Absent students can use your podcasts to see class lectures, daily activities, homework assignments, handouts, and more. A review of literature that reports the use of audio podcasts in K-12 and higher education found that individuals (1) use existing podcasts and/or (2) create their own podcasts. Students can create their own podcast to share their learning experiences with each other and also with other students from other schools.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} a student using {{reversibility}} is when learning new vocabulary. The student creates a list of unfamiliar words from a literary text. Then, he researches the definition of those words before asking classmate to test him. His teacher has given a set of particular instructions that he must follow in a particular order: he must write the word before defining it, and complete these two steps repeatedly. A child in the preoperational stage gets confused during this process and needs assistance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> to stay on task. The [...] teacher refers {{him back to his}} text in order to notate the next word before he can define it. [...] A child in the preoperational stage does not understand the organization required to complete this assignment. [...] However, a child in the concrete operational stage understands the organization, and he can recall the steps in any order while being able to follow the order given. Using decentration, the child has the two activities on his mind: identify words and find them in the dictionary.|$|E

In 1970 Central began to offer the , the first gifted and talented program approved by Saint Paul Public Schools. This humanities based program was started in order to offer in-depth topics in the humanities that were not available in normal classes. The program continues to challenge students to think independently and to learn from each other and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> in a discussion-based approach towards learning. Over 15 Quest classes are currently offered including classes on world culture, film documentary, ancient civilizations, the Harlem Renaissance and Shakespeare literature. Central has participated in the University of Minnesota‚Äòs College in the Schools program since 1994.|$|E

2500|$|This term 'scaffolding' is {{a useful}} metaphor {{that is used to}} symbolise the process of {{supporting}} a learner {{in the early stages of}} the learning process ‚Äì as the walls get higher ‚Äì until there is sufficient evidence of knowledge and skills having been acquired, to then be able to remove that scaffolding so the learner is able to 'stand alone', or be effectively independent enough to continue learning 'alone'. In a similar way, there is a gradual dismantling of the scaffolding as the 'job' becomes more secure and so there is a gradual release of responsibility <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> to the learner. As scaffolding is temporary, so too are the lessons that are constructed to help students as they embark into unfamiliar thinking. As noted by Pearson and Gallagher, [...] "The critical stage of the model is the 'guided practice,' the stage in which the teacher gradually releases task responsibility to the students." [...] As such, these lessons eventually fade away as students become gradually more comfortable with the learning and are able to work without the necessary guidance of the teacher.|$|E
