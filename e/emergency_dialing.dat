40|$|SummaryBackgroundMyocardial {{infarction}} with ST-segment elevation (STEMI) is {{a medical}} emergency requiring specific management, with the main aim of achieving reperfusion as quickly as possible. Guidelines from medical societies have defined optimal management, with proven efficacy on morbi-mortality. AimsOur study aimed to evaluate trends in practices between 2002 and 2010 in the emergency management of STEMI in a single French department, namely Cote d’Or. MethodsAll patients admitted with a first STEMI {{to one of the}} six participating coronary care units (private or public) in Cote d’Or since January 2001 were included in a prospective registry (obseRvatoire des Infarctus de Côte d’Or [RICO]). Based on these data, we analysed trends in prehospital times between 2002 and 2010. ResultsA total of 4114 patients were included in this analysis. Between 2002 and 2010, there was an increase in the proportion of patients who contacted the <b>emergency</b> services (by <b>dialling</b> 15) as first medical contact; however, the time from onset of symptoms to first medical contact remained stable over the study period. Overall, there was little change in prehospital management times but we noted a slight reduction in time to reperfusion. ConclusionDespite some improvement in prehospital management practices between 2002 and 2010 in Cote d’Or, there is still significant room for improvement to achieve earlier reperfusion in STEMI patients...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundMyocardial {{infarction}} with ST segment elevation (STEMI) is {{a medical}} emergency requiring specific management aiming to achieve reperfusion as early as possible. AimsWe aimed to evaluate the temporal trends between 2002 and 2010 in STEMI management and time delays in an eastern region of France (Cote d’Or). MethodsAll consecutive patients admitted for a first STEMI in the RICO survey (Observatoire des Infarctus de Côte d’Or) from 1 st January 2002 to 31 st december 2010 have been included. We analysed trends in pre-hospital and hospital management times and reperfusion. Results 4114 STEMI patients were included over the study period. Mean age and GRACE risk score increased from 2002 to 2010 (64 to 67 y, p= 0, 001 and 152 to 155 p= 0, 049). At symptom onset, {{there was an increase}} in the rate of patients who called the <b>emergency</b> number (<b>dial</b> 15) and a decrease in the rate of call to GP as first medical contact (from 24. 8 to 39. 4 % and from 57. 1 to 34. 2 %, respectively). However, prehospital times including patient time (from onset of symptoms to call for medical seeking) remained stable over time. There was a significant difference in time to first medical contact according to age, with patients aged under 50 years getting help on average 40 to 100 minutes earlier than patients aged over 50 years. (p= 0. 019). The average time from first medical contact to reperfusion decreased significantly from 339 minutes in 2002 to 239 minutes in 2010 (p= 0. 009). Over the study period, there was an inversion in the distribution of reperfusion strategies, with a decrease in fibrinolysis and an increase in primary PCI (from 35 % to 27 % and from 23. 1 to 36. 7 %, respectively). The rate of patients without acute reperfusion dropped from 41, 9 to 36, 3 % (p< 0, 001). We found a marked improvement in time to reperfusion including fibrinolysis and door to balloon time (from 150 to 120 min and from 70 to 45 min, respectively). ConclusionBetween 2002 and 2010, despite marked improvements in management including reperfusion strategies, there is still a room for improvement in order to achieve earlier reperfusion in STEMI patients...|$|R
30|$|Each {{of these}} {{intervention}} sessions took approximately 40  min to complete and was {{delivered in the}} form of dramas and interactive games. Banners and posters with illustrations were also used as visual aids to reinforce the messages (Chan and Wong 2017). During the intervention in 2015, villagers were taught to identify flammable materials such as washing powder, alcohol, matches, lighters, and plug sockets as well as the behaviors that can lead to fire accidents, burns, and electric shock. The correct method of using a fire extinguishing blanket and the evacuation strategy in case of major fires were also taught. During the 2016 intervention, two key messages, namely the prevention of fire and the response to fire accidents, were delivered. Content delivered included “not overloading electrical sockets with appliances”; “avoiding the placement of combustible items near electrical appliances”; and “unplugging electrical appliances when not in use to save energy” and prevent fire accidents. When experiencing fires that might have been caused by electric appliances/devices, villagers were reminded to “cut off the electricity supply immediately” and “not to use water to put out electrical fire.” They were advised to escape to a safe and open area like the drum tower (their community focal point) and <b>dial</b> <b>emergency</b> number 119 to report the residential fire to prevent it from spreading and becoming a forest fire. A fire blanket and a disaster preparedness kit (including an emergency blanket, a torch, a flint, a whistle, a multipurpose knife, and an empty medication box) were distributed to the subjects who had completed both the pre- and post-intervention questionnaires as reminders of what they had been taught during the interventions. The program was conducted in Mandarin, and a summary of the key messages was given by a local translator.|$|R
5000|$|On 7 February 2009, catastrophic bushfires {{occurred}} in Victoria, {{otherwise known as}} Black Saturday bushfires. Over 18,000 calls to the Triple Zero Emergency Service on that day were left unanswered {{and the majority of}} calls took much longer to be answered than usual. Due to the unprecedented amount of calls coming through Telstra decided to isolate all Victorian emergency calls which were answered by the Melbourne emergency call centre with all the remaining calls answered by the Sydney emergency call centre. Telstra also activated the generic extreme event recorded voice announcement [...] "You have <b>dialled</b> <b>Emergency</b> Triple Zero. If you require police, fire or ambulance please stay on the line. If you require your local State Emergency Service please hang up and dial 1223 — that’s 1223 — as this service cannot be connected through Triple Zero" [...] which temporary replaced their front end announcement While Telstra records show 95 emergency call centre employees rostered during the 24-hour period on 7 February 2009, call pick up delays were evident due to lengthy delays at the SECC level, being ESTA. Telstra agents were left tied up on phone calls with callers, waiting for emergency services to answer, thus calls in the 000 queue were unable to be answered. Callers in a queue waiting for a Telstra agent to answer the phone were played an RVA every 30 seconds in the following terms, [...] "You have <b>dialled</b> the <b>Emergency</b> Triple Zero number.

40|$|In {{the event}} of an onboard emergency, air {{transport}} pilots are remarkably adept at safely landing their aircraft. However, the tasks of selecting an alternate landing site and developing a safe path to land are very difficult in the high workload, high stress environment of a cockpit during an emergency. The purpose of this research was to develop an automated path planning aid which would assist the pilot in the completion of these tasks. A prototype was developed to test this concept experimentally. The experiment was also intended to gather further information about how pilots think about and accomplish this task as well as the best ways to assist them. In order to better understand the priorities and processes pilots use when dealing with emergency planning, a survey of airline pilots was conducted. The results of this survey highlighted the fact that each emergency is unique and has its own set of factors which are critically important. One factor which is important in many emergencies is the need to land quickly. The survey responses indicated {{that one of the most}} important characteristics of a useful tool is that it should provide pertinent information in an easy to use manner, and should not divert too much attention from their other tasks. A number of design goals drove the development of the prototype aid. First, the aid was to work within current aircraft, without requiring substantial redesign on the cockpit. Second, the aid was to help improve pilots' performance without increasing their workload. Finally, the aid was designed to assist pilots in obtaining and processing critical information which influences the site selection and path development tasks. One variation of the aid included a filter dial which allowed pilots to quickly reduce the number of options considered, another variation of the aid did not include such a dial. These two variations of the aid were tested in order to assess the impact of the addition of the filter dial to the system. Though many of the results did not prove to be statistically significant, they suggest that the addition of a filter dial improved the quality of the selected landing site; however, it also increased the time required for the selection. The results were obtained in both familiar and unfamiliar <b>emergencies.</b> The <b>dial</b> was shown to improve the time to complete the task in the case of unfamiliar emergencies. The experiment also compared an optimal ranking system to a non-optimal system, for which results showed no significant difference between the two. This may imply that while pilots did not tend to over rely on the ranking system, under-reliance may need to be addressed by training and a better understanding of the factors which impact the rankings. The participants found that the aid facilitates quick and easy access to critical information. The aid was also useful for processing this information by filtering out options which were inappropriate for a given scenario through the use of the filter dial. The participants also made recommendations about possible improvements which could be made to the system such as better filter settings which are more similar to the way that pilots think about their options.

40|$|Civil {{protection}} is a current topic in today's world. Nearly {{every person in}} our society meets an emergency during their lives and therefore {{it is important for}} every person to be aware of at least the basics of this issue, to know the situations which can come and the ways how to solve the issue. Civil protection in the Czech Republic has developed and it has reached its current form in which the emergency is based on the Integrated Rescue System. The important thing is that {{at the very beginning of}} the emergency there is an ordinary citizen who is at the place of formation of emergency and he or she has to <b>dial</b> <b>emergency</b> telephone number and then try to minimize its negative effects until the Integrated Rescue System comes. Therefore it is important for people to gain knowledge which can be used during emergency. The knowledge should be gained either at primary or secondary school. Nowadays civil {{protection is}} a part of curricula in primary and secondary education. However, there are curricula for ordinary pupils and for pupils with special educational needs. Current trends in special education along with current legislation are trying to integrate pupils with special educational needs into ordinary classes. It means that a pupil who was diagnosed as a pupil with learning disability, has difficulties with learning at primary school and is used to the attitude and support of special education, will be in a class with students without disabilities and will be supposed to do well at school. If it will be so, the pupils will need special study texts in many subjects. Therefore the issue of integration, its influence on the quality of education and potential impact on global integration of pupils with special educational needs into regular education are stated in the thesis. The aim of this thesis was to compile a study text with the topic of civil protection for pupils with special educational needs. The study text should be adequate to their abilities. Another reason for compiling the text was the fact that in Secondary education protection of civilians used to be a part of civics but, as the Framework educational programme for Secondary education has been changed, protection of civilians is now often taught in physical education. In Primary education protection of civilians can be taught as a cross cutting issue nearly in every subject. Physical education teachers and teachers of pupils with special educational needs do not have any books which would be specially created for this group of pupils. The thesis is divided into a theoretical part and a part with a research question and a methodology of a research. The theoretical part is aimed at the history of civil protection in the Czech Republic with its development to its current form, the current situation in education and the current trends in relation to education of pupils with special educational needs and including civil protection lessons into the Framework educational programme for the given group of pupils. In the works devoted to the research question and research methodology, was compiled research question whether pupils with special educational needs adequately trained in the area of civil protection. Due to the nature of thesis it was necessary to determine the state of awareness of students on the issue of civil protection, were established hypothesis, first - whether the pupils' awareness of the issue reaches the 80 % correct answers, second - whether pupils' knowledge in the area depend on the study year. A questionnaire for verification or refutation of the hypothesis was compiled and 104 pupils with special educational needs aged 15 to 18 filled it. The results of the survey show the lack of knowledge of the surveyed group. Both hypothesis appeared as alternative. The findings of the survey were important for creating an educational material within this thesis...|$|R
