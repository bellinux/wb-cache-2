That same year he also conducted and acted in One Hundred Men and a Girl, with Deanna Durbin and Adolphe Menjou. In 1939, Stokowski collaborated with Walt Disney to create the motion picture {{for which he is}} best known: Fantasia. He conducted all the music (with the exception of a [...] "jam session" [...] {{in the middle of the}} film) and included his own orchestrations for the Toccata and Fugue in D minor and Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria segments. Stokowski even <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> (and shake hands with) Mickey Mouse on screen, although he would later say with a smile that Mickey Mouse got to shake hands with him. This footage of Stokowski was incorporated into Fantasia 2000.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 March 2005, Crowe {{revealed}} to GQ magazine that Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents had approached him {{prior to the}} 73rd Academy Awards in March 2001, {{and told him that}} the terrorist group al-Qaeda wanted to kidnap him. Crowe told the magazine that {{it was the first time}} he had ever heard of al-Qaeda and was quoted as saying: [...] "You get this late-night call from the FBI when you arrive in Los Angeles, and they're, like, absolutely full-on. 'We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you now before you do anything. We have to have a discussion with you, Mr. Crowe.'" [...] Crowe recalled that: [...] "It was something to do with some recording picked up by a French policewoman, I think, in either Libya or Algiers...it was about taking iconographic Americans out of the picture as a sort of cultural destabilisation plan." ...|$|E

6000|$|This was Charley Horton's {{first visit}} to us, but it {{was by no means}} the last. After this he came with Harry, not often at first, but as he became more intimate, much more frequently, and {{sometimes}} even when Harry did not bring him in; and as he got to know us, and found that women were not such terrible beings after all, he became comparatively at his ease. Certainly Polly did not help to make him so, for she teazed and put him out of countenance most unmercifully; the consequence was, that although before very long he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me almost in the same way he did to Harry, he was always shy and awkward when he addressed her. I wondered myself that he came at all, for Polly plagued him sadly in spite of what I could say to her; I even expressed myself surprised to Harry, but Harry laughed, and said, [...] "Do you know, Agnes, I am firmly of opinion that Charley is rather smitten with Polly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With swords {{it would}} be different, but in a row between you and him {{it would be}} just the naked hands. So I advise you to leave him alone, for if you make him fight I will see fair play. All the time I was a {{prisoner}} in England I was well treated by his people, and just as I was treated myself and saw other French prisoners treated so I will see him treated. Before this voyage is over it is not impossible the tables will be turned, and that you may find yourselves prisoners {{in the hands of the}} English; so I recommend you to behave to him in the same way you would like to be treated yourselves if you were taken prisoners. I can see the lad is good-tempered and willing. He is a stranger here among us all, he can't speak a word of our language, and he has a right to fair treatment. When he gets to know our language he will be able to shift for himself; but until he does I mean to look after him, and any one who plays tricks on him has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Miss Regan," [...] Ralph said earnestly. [...] "The fact is I haven't joined long, and I don't {{care much}} for parties. You see, I have only left school a few months, and haven't <b>got</b> {{accustomed}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> ladies yet; and O'Connor--who is always {{up to some}} fun or other--did it just to cure what he calls my shyness.

6000|$|... "If {{you think}} I like this {{political}} business {{any better than}} you do, you're mightily mistaken," [...] he replied. [...] "And now I {{want to hear what}} plan you've got for the convention. Suppose there's a deadlock, as you say there will be, {{how are you going to}} handle it? Can you get a deal through between Giles Henderson and Adam Hunt? With all my other work, I've had to go into this myself. Hunt hasn't got a chance. Bascom and Botcher are egging him on and making him believe he has. When Hunt gets into the convention and begins to fall off, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him, Vane. And his delegates have all got to be seen at the Pelican the night before and understand that they're to swing to Henderson after two ballots. You've got to keep your hand on the throttle in the convention, you understand. And I don't need to impress upon you how grave are the consequences if this man Crewe gets in, with public sentiment behind him and a reactionary Lower House. You've got to keep your hand on the throttle." ...|$|E

Then bitter affliction came to us, and her intellect broke, and she veered round to darkness. Strange {{difference}} of sex, that time and circumstance, which enlarge the views of most men, narrow the views of women almost invariably. And now the ultimate horror has come--her giving herself like this to what she loathes, in her enslavement to forms! She, so sensitive, so shrinking, that the very wind seemed to blow on her {{with a touch of}} deference... As for Sue and me when we were at our own best, long ago--when our minds were clear, and our love of truth fearless--the time was not ripe for us! Our ideas were fifty years too soon to be any good to us. And so the resistance they met with brought reaction in her, and recklessness and ruin on me! ... There--this, Mrs. Edlin, is how I go on to myself continually, as I lie here. I must be boring you awfully." ...|$|E
