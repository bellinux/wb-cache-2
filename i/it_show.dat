500|$|In the sex scene, the then-pregnant Lena Headey was {{substituted}} by a body double; {{the production}} hid her pregnancy {{for the rest}} of the season. In the scene in which the Starks encounter a stag killed by a dire wolf as they return from the execution, an actual animal was used rather than a prop. As the stag had been dead for two days, it stank so much that the actors had to take much care not to let <b>it</b> <b>show</b> on their faces. [...] Some scenes filmed were never aired, for example a flashback to the death of Eddard Stark's brother, and the death of Jon Arryn.|$|E

Worldwide attendance of the annual Memorial of Christ's death fell from 90,434 in 1925 to 17,380 in 1928. Memorial attendance figures did not surpass 90,000 again until 1940. Author Tony Wills, who analyzed attendance and [...] "field worker" [...] statistics, suggests it was the [...] "more dedicated" [...] Bible Students who quit through the 1920s, {{to be replaced by}} newcomers in larger numbers, although Rutherford dismissed the loss of the original Bible Students as the Lord [...] "shaking out" [...] the unfaithful.

Mitchell, Jr., grandson of NAACP chief lobbyist Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr., said [...] "It is a civil rights issue when we as a state and a government deny equal protection under the law." [...] Several delegates who originally co-sponsored the bill began to express doubts after being lobbied by church-going constituents, including Sam Arora and Tiffany Alston, who delayed the bill's vote in the House committee by skipping the voting session. The bill passed through the committee after its chairman, who rarely votes in committee, voted in favor. The House majority whip opposed the bill. Despite pleas from gay lawmakers, the House of Delegates voted to send the bill back to committee on March 11, 2011 and would not reconsider it before January 2012.|$|E

Both Lea and Laurie Holden were required to learn Russian for the first scene following the opening credits. Alex Shostak Jr., who portrayed Dmitri, worked 12–14 hours a day; make-up was applied to give the appearance that his eyes and mouth had been sewed up, and a small straw was pushed between his lips to give him water. During the filming of the episode, he was [...] "literally" [...] blind and guided by the crew members throughout the filming of his scenes. Shostak provided the translation for his own lines from English to Russian. Holden and Lea worked diligently together to perfect their lines in Russian. Holden explained, [...] "we'd come up with these fun ways to test ourselves to know if we had really nailed <b>it.</b> <b>Show</b> tunes come to mind, but I also remember this one time my dialect coach had me call a Russian friend of his on his cell phone to see if he could understand me.

2500|$|As with {{previous}} sessions, Mike Sapone acted {{as both a}} band member and co-producer, while the band were also involved in the albums production. Discussing Sapone's involvement, Lacey defined Sapone as having [...] "as much at stake with the music as we do; he's as invested in it as we are, sometimes more." [...] Accardi described Sapone as having [...] "an uncanny ability to hear something you’re doing and immediately track it to any song in his library that he stores in his brain. He'll go to <b>it,</b> <b>show</b> it to you {{and tell you that}} that’s what needs to happen. Here's the better version of it. This is what you’re trying to do and you don't even realize it." [...] Most of the songs were brought to the studio in acoustic form, sometimes as a complete song and sometimes as just a part or riff. The band would then build upon these ideas, recording everything as they worked. The band members were not limited by their normal roles within Brand New, with much instrument swapping and experimenting taking place in writing individual parts. Lacey later commented that [...] "it was such a collaborative effort with the band. Vin might write a drum part or Brian might write a guitar part or whatever. We're not really keeping tabs of how much everyone has at stake on each song".|$|E

[...] It is noteworthy that Devereux Emmet, the designer of Mohawk Golf Club, was the first golfer of note to be shown Mr. Knight's new aluminum putter while he was visiting Mohawk. [...] Emmet asked to take the putter with him back to his home course, Garden City Golf Club, where he proposed to [...] "play with <b>it,</b> <b>show</b> it at Garden City and at Myopia and will then send it back to you". It is reported that [...] "A day or two later Mr. Knight received a telegram from Mr. W. J. Travis ordering a putter like Mr. Emmet's, and one was hurriedly made and forwarded". Later, a second putter was sent to Travis which was declared [...] "the best putter I have ever used." [...] Travis used this putter to finish second in the U.S. Open Championship held at Garden City Golf Club. [...] "Within a week thereafter, Mr. Knight received over one hundred letters from prominent golfers asking for a putter like Mr. Travis's". [...] Knight was not prepared for such a response and was particularly concerned about what to call it. [...] It is reported that he was [...] "anxious to call it the 'Travis' putter'." [...] He arranged a meeting with Mr. Emmet and Mr. Travis. [...] Emmet had consistently referred to it as the [...] "Schenectady Putter" [...] and Travis agreed that Schenectady would be [...] "a more suitable and lasting name for the putter than his own, in which view Mr. Knight rather reluctantly concurred." [...] After his initial success with the Schenectady Putter in 1902, Travis used the putter to win the 1903 U.S. Amateur and then, of course, the 1904 British Amateur. [...] The putter became an instant commercial success.|$|E
