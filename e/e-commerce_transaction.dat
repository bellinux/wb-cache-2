RBAC is used in commercial applications and also in military systems, where multi-level security requirements may also exist. RBAC differs from DAC in that DAC allows users to control access to their resources, while in RBAC, access is controlled at the system level, outside of the user's control. Although RBAC is non-discretionary, it can be distinguished from MAC primarily in the way permissions are handled. MAC controls read and write permissions based on a user's clearance level and additional labels. RBAC controls collections of permissions that may include complex operations such as an <b>e-commerce</b> <b>transaction,</b> or may {{be as simple as}} read or write.

40|$|MCom (South African and International Taxation), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 This {{research}} {{identified that}} e-commerce is growing annually {{and has a}} significant impact on the South African economy. When the Minister of Finance announced that VAT registration would become compulsory for foreign suppliers importing <b>e-commerce</b> <b>transactions</b> into South Africa, there were many speculations regarding the implication this will have for South Africa. The main objectives for the research are to determine whether the current VAT structure and VAT Act in South Africa will be able to support the proposal made by the Minister of Finance and what possible challenges should be considered regarding VAT on <b>e-commerce</b> <b>transactions</b> that were already identified by other countries. It will further be considered whether the proposal is in line with current international legislation and trends. Therefore, the development and implementation of VAT on <b>e-commerce</b> <b>transactions</b> in the European Union and New Zealand were researched and discussed to obtain an understanding of the similar current VAT systems in other parts of the world. It was identified during the research that there are still challenges experienced with the implementation of VAT on <b>e-commerce</b> <b>transactions.</b> The challenges range from the anonymity of the parties to the identification of the permanent establishment of the supplier, which are discussed in detail. These challenges can lead to tax evasion and the erosion of a country’s revenue base. The proposal by the Minister of Finance is found to be in line with other countries’ implementation of VAT on <b>e-commerce</b> <b>transactions.</b> Furthermore, South Africa’s current VAT system was analysed to ascertain whether it is sufficient to implement VAT on <b>e-commerce</b> <b>transactions.</b> Currently, SARS is dependent on the consumer’s honesty to declare the VAT on all <b>e-commerce</b> <b>transactions.</b> It was further identified that there are challenges relating to the implementation of VAT on ecommerce transactions as it is lacking place of supply rules, which often creates uncertainty about whether a product is subject to VAT. It was found in the study that the current VAT system would not be sufficient to support the proposal made by the Minister of Finance without an amendment to the VAT system to secure the income from the consumption tax on <b>e-commerce</b> <b>transactions.</b> It was further found that there are worldwide still challenges experienced with the implementation of VAT on <b>e-commerce</b> <b>transactions.</b> Recommendations were made for further research relating to the new Tax Bill that is due to be released in 2014 and the impact it will have on the South African economy.

40|$|This study {{measures}} {{the contributions of}} e-commerce activities to the national tax revenues in Nigeria, {{against the background of}} some country-specific problems. Using a data set spanning between 2008 and 2011 we develop a model that {{measures the}} statistical significance of indirect taxes sourced from four proxies of e-commerce: Automatic Teller Machines (ATM); Point-of-Sale (POS); On-line Purchasing (Internet Purchasing); and, Mobile Phone Payment (GSM). We find that <b>e-commerce</b> <b>transactions</b> have a very low overall contribution to the national tax revenue. We also find that while tax revenue contributions from ATM and POS are relatively significant, those from Internet Purchasing and GSM are insignificant.

40|$|Security for {{e-commerce}} {{is a vital}} topic due to {{the relentless}} drive to more business and commerce to the internet. Consumers are being strongly encouraged by the profit-oriented, cost-minimisation nature of commercial enterprises to shop on-line. Consumers themselves, though, have limited confidence about the security of their personal information which is transmitted in each and every on-line transaction. They are demanding much more in this regard from everyone concerned in the on-line transaction, from the database vendor to the internet applications developer, including both client and server systems. One solution is to embed much of this required security transparently into the application performing the on-line <b>e-commerce</b> <b>transaction.</b> We believe {{this can be done}} {{through the use of a}} simple "roles and rights markup language " based on roles and rights, implemented using XML, which can call upon the cryptographic and other security enforcing technologies required to give consumers a high degree of confidence that their on-line <b>e-commerce</b> <b>transaction</b> is secure. ...|$|E

Semantic similarity and large document clustering is the most difficult task as the web data has a lot of redundancy like outliers, missing values etc, data prepossessing is very much necessary. Search results produced by social search engine (web search) give more visibility to the content created. This paper focuses on semantic similarity measure, the F-measure for large document clustering. Document filtering is a task to retrieve documents relevant to user's profile. Generally, filtering systems calculate the similarity between the profile and each incoming document for retrieving documents with similarity having higher threshold value.
