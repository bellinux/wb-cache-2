When he returns, he finds the apartment has been robbed after Kramer left the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> While Kramer promises to find the robbers, George offers him the chance {{to move into a}} much better apartmentâ€”a move he accepts, allowing Elaine to move in Jerry's apartment and away from her annoying roommate Tina.|$|E
25|$|By Knox's account, {{having spent}} the night with Sollecito, she arrived at Via della Pergola7 {{on the morning of}} 2November 2007, finding the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> and drops of blood in the {{bathroom}} she shared with Kercher. Kercher's bedroom door was locked, which Knox took as indicating that Kercher was sleeping. After showering in the bathroom she and Kercher shared, Knox found feces in the toilet of the bathroom shared by Romanelli and Mezzetti. Knox went back to Sollecito's home and later returned with him to Via della Pergola7. Noticing a broken window in Romanelli's bedroom and alarmed that Kercher did not answer her door, Sollecito unsuccessfully tried to force the door open. Sollecito called his sister, a lieutenant in the carabinieri, for advice. She advised him to call the 112 emergency number, which he did.|$|E

When Jerry returns he finds the apartment has been burglarized because Kramer left the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> by mistake. As a way of making up, Kramer promises to find the items that were stolen from Jerry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>open</b> on to {{pedestrian}} only area:In Cressingham Gardens the <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> of dwellings <b>open</b> on to pedestrian only avenues and pathways. This allows {{efficient use}} of residential land area, as pathways can be much narrower than roads with pavements. Experience has shown that there are substantial social benefits form having <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>open</b> on to a pedestrian area. The most important of these, is that the pedestrianized space provides a safe play area for small children.|$|R
60|$|Hal {{heard no}} more. The <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> and a {{stranger}} hurried in.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{told our}} names, {{and in an}} instant the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened.</b>|$|R
60|$|Annabel {{rose and}} {{followed}} her sister from the room. A maidservant held the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> Anna sent her away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, your ladyship. One of {{the maid}} {{servants}} believes that {{she heard the}} <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> at five o'clock this morning." ...|$|E
60|$|Larry {{pushed the}} <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> grunting. He set his {{briefcase}} {{down and took}} off his hat. Then he saw Bob for the first time.|$|E
60|$|Just as she {{had gone}} up stairs, the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> to admit Bobus.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} a wide <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> {{revealing}} a colored woman holding a lamp.|$|R
60|$|Hal {{had made}} four {{copies of the}} letter when the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> and Caleb Allen entered.|$|R
60|$|He {{left the}} room. Jill heard the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> She waited breathlessly. Pity for Uncle Chris {{struggled}} with the sterner feeling that it served him right.|$|E
60|$|She obeyed him mutely, {{pressing}} {{her hands to}} her eyes, shivering in every limb. French stood back inside the room. He heard the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> he heard Quest's voice outside.|$|E
60|$|With {{a desperate}} bound she darted into the passage {{and through the}} hall, {{dragging}} him by the hand, and threw the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> Without, the street was silent and empty.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> and feet were {{heard in the}} passage {{stamping}} off the snow.|$|R
60|$|Tony {{entered a}} small sitting-room, {{into which the}} <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> and took a seat by Cousin Maria.|$|R
60|$|The <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> {{and they}} heard Dr. May's step hesitating in the hall, {{as if he}} could not bear to come in.|$|R
6000|$|In {{another moment}} Adye {{was leading the}} way downstairs. They found the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> and the policemen {{standing}} outside staring at empty air. [...] "He's got away, sir," [...] said one.|$|E
60|$|Morel {{knew she}} was coming. He had the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> Everybody was on tiptoe. Half the street turned out. They {{heard the sound of}} the great motor-car. Mrs. Morel, smiling, drove home down the street.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you will}} do it," [...] said Fred. [...] "I wonder what you and Henrietta cannot do between you! Oh, there is Uncle Geoffrey come in," [...] he exclaimed, as he heard the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens,</b> {{revealing}} a bright light, {{and a bag}} on the floor. Lea walks to the door, picks up the bag, and leaves.|$|R
60|$|And the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> and Freddie {{came out}} on to the veranda, {{for all the world}} {{as if he had been}} taking a cue.|$|R
50|$|The <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> onto {{a hallway}} which has doors to rooms on either side, before opening through a timber archway {{into a large}} dining room.|$|R
60|$|I call at {{the office}} of the Dublin {{organization}} in Westmoreland Street, and find the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> and the office door open, and though the office is empty the cupboard door open and eighteen pounds in gold upon the shelf.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's go {{into the}} orchard and wait," [...] said the Story Girl. [...] "It's one o'clock now, so in another hour we'll know the worst. We'll leave the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> and we'll hear the big clock when it strikes two." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good night," [...] said Father Brown, as {{the doctor}} walked briskly to the gate. He had left the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> so that a shaft of gaslight fell upon them. In the light of this Brown opened the {{envelope}} and read the following words: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "`"The Doll's House"?' {{he cried}} vehemently; `why, {{that is just}} where Ibsen was so wrong! Why, the whole aim of a house {{is to be a}} doll's house. Don't you remember, when you were a child, how those little windows WERE windows, while the big windows weren't. A child has a doll's house, and shrieks when a <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> inwards. A banker has a real house, yet how {{numerous}} are the bankers who fail to emit the faintest shriek when their real <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>open</b> inwards.' ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was just}} eleven o'clock, and they 'ad shut {{up for the}} night, when the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> and George stood there smiling at 'em and shaking his 'ead.|$|R

6000|$|... "You must, indeed, {{have been}} different. Mamma, I heard the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> If {{it is my}} uncle coming in, just ask him to step upstairs, and let me hear his {{assurance}} that I am truly awake and collected, and not dreaming or delirious." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{heard the}} <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> they heard Jenning's voice raised in unusual and indignant protest. Then their own door was {{suddenly}} flung wide, and a miracle happened. John's glass slipped from his fingers, {{and the wine}} streamed out across the carpet. He shrank back, gripping the tablecloth. Stephen turned his head, and sat as if turned to stone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Senores," [...] he protested, [...] "a Royalist was {{a monster}} to our overwrought feelings. I {{am telling you}} this {{in order not to}} be {{suspected}} of the slightest tenderness towards that old Royalist's daughter. Moreover, as you know, my affections were engaged elsewhere. But I could not help noticing her on rare occasions when with the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> she stood in the porch.|$|E
60|$|Tommy took to {{his heels}} and ran--none too soon. The <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> and {{a hail of}} bullets {{followed}} him. Fortunately none of them hit him. He turned {{the corner of the}} square.|$|R
6000|$|Just as {{they reached}} the porch the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> and a little girl stood before them. She {{appeared}} to be {{about the same age as}} Dorothy, and smiling upon her visitors she said, sweetly: ...|$|R
