40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the use of digital {{technologies}} within higher education is now ‘natural’; that devices and networks which might ‘once might have appeared exotic or transformative are now considered mainstream’. Whilst students in higher education might endorse these expectations that some form of technology will feature in their study, it is vital that this is predicated on a considered, relevant and supported approach to using technology in learning and teaching which is integral to academic practice and aligned with professional values. But in a climate where a prevalent discourse of innovation dominates, how do we know if we have got the basics right?

Our goal is to learn what are the important aspects in a design of more effective e-assessments that support learning of mathematical subjects in a higher education setting.

These students were all previously exposed to on-line assessments containing substantial mathematical work, including testing of and feedback on the algebraic structure of their answers. They were provided with detailed online feedback, and we therefore specifically examine the effect of formative feedback on the usage of educational technology. Our results suggest that students find on-line feedback more enjoyable and useful than traditional feedback. 'Attitude' and 'Enjoyment' are the two most important factors influencing their usage intention. Our results also show that, even for this <b>digital</b> generation, <b>confidence</b> in using computers and the availability of support for using information technology are important factors in making effective use of on-line assessments...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} a study of pedagogic {{practices}} surrounding novice readers of digital texts in four early childhood classrooms in Queensland, Australia. Until recently, digital literacies have been generally resisted, dismissed or overlooked by early childhood teachers in early reading agendas. However, there is now considerable pressure on Australian teachers to plan within a multiliteracies framework and to include digital texts into their classroom programs. In Queensland, for example, 'New Basics' reforms of public education hold teachers accountable in this regard, especially as the tasks relating to new basics include multiple text forms and modes of delivery. In this context, it is concerning that recent Australian research has found a surprisingly low level of understanding of <b>digital</b> literacies, and <b>confidence</b> in teaching these, {{on the part of}} both practising teachers and new graduates. The aim of this paper is to inform professional development in this field by describing and explaining the digital reading pedagogies that some teachers are creating...|$|R

People {{come into contact with}} digital technologies via their family and friendship networks as well as at their workplaces, colleges and schools. Informal advice and support are crucial to acquiring basic computing skills, and where neighbours and friends use computers and internet, this can facilitate the learning process. One of the strengths of the present research is its ability to shed light on the ways in which individual attributes interact with the social context to influence the utilisation of digital technologies. We present the results of a series of multilevel models that explain the determinants of {{familiarity with}} <b>digital</b> technologies, <b>confidence</b> in computers and competence in their use. There is a high degree of consistency in the results of our statistical models, although different facets of the digital divide also have their own specificities. The key individual-level variables that influence computer awareness, confidence and competence are having a third-level education, belonging to a younger or older age group, being in a low or high social class category, household income and the number of friends and neighbours who are able to provide help and advice in relation to computers and internet. Other variables, including financial difficulties, the degree of satisfaction with one’s neighbourhood of residence, being unemployed, engaged in home duties or a full-time student and the amount of support provided by other family members also have an influence on various aspects of the digital divide...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the key initiatives being undertaken by government, {{industry and the}} community to develop the digital economy along with case studies of successful individuals and industries engaged in the area. Executive Summary The digital economy is the global network {{of economic and social}} activities that are enabled by platforms such as the Internet, mobile and sensor networks. The digital economy refers to the devices most of us use each day such as computers, phones and game consoles. It includes the online maps that we consult, the web searches that we do to find information and our electronic banking. A successful digital economy is essential for Australia 2 ̆ 7 s economic growth and our ability to maintain our international standing. It offers new opportunities for businesses to a larger, potentially global, audience and for individuals to connect and collaborate. This paper explains: 	why the digital economy is important for Australia 	the current state of digital economy engagement in Australia and why current metrics point to a need for strategic action 	the elements of a successful digital economy 	the role for the Government in developing Australia 2 ̆ 7 s digital economy. Advancing Australia 2 ̆ 7 s digital economy requires action by government, industry and the community. The key areas of focus for government, industry and the community in order to maximise the benefits of the digital economy for all Australians are: 	for Government, to: 	 		lay the foundations Australia 2 ̆ 7 s digital infrastructure 		facilitate innovation 		set conducive regulatory frameworks 	 	 	for industry, to: 	 		demonstrate <b>digital</b> <b>confidence</b> and build digital skills 		adopt smart technology 		develop sustainable online content models 	 	 	for the community, to: 	 		enjoy <b>digital</b> <b>confidence</b> and digital media literacy skills 		experience inclusive digital participation 		benefit through online engagement. 	 	   FORMAT OPTIONS Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Digital Economy: Future Directions—snapshot 	Snapshot (HTML) 	Snapshot (PDF, 1. 2 mb) 	Snapshot (RTF,  2. 4 mb) 	Snapshot (ODT, 2. 4 mb) Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Digital Economy: Future Directions—final report 	Final report (HTML) 	Final report (PDF, 1. 3 mb) 	Final report - PART 1 (RTF, 2. 8 mb) / Final report - PART 2 (RTF, 2. 2 mb) 	Final report - PART 1 (ODT, 2. 3 mb) / Final report - PART 2 (ODT, 2. 4 mb...|$|E

However, there were cross-cutting themes, such as collaboration, reflection and learner empathy - all elements of a design thinking mindset. For purposes of triangulation and inter-coder reliability, {{a second round of}} analysis was then conducted in which we re-examined the codes through the lens of design thinking literature and concepts. This more detailed round involved two more colleagues, known for their expertise in design thinking. The second round analysis revealed that principles of design thinking directly or indirectly framed or informed the professional practice of these champions, and were consequently mapped on existing models of design thinking mindsets.

40|$|The {{expression}} 'Digital Divide' {{refers to}} more than access to technology, for the possession of hardware cannot guarantee equity of participation. For users of assistive technologies, all the prerequisites for access can be in place but if the digital data has not been designed {{with the needs of}} their technology in mind then access will continue to be denied. The advantage of digital data is its flexibility which ensures it can be available in multiple formats and customised to individual preference.

We participated in development of the content in the third module of chemistry teacher education in this project. After first year of teacher training, we implemented an experimental assessment of learning module to ascertain competencies required for work with digital content and digital technologies (DT) and to determine the state of perception, acquisition and development of digital skills of chemistry teachers. The main objective of the research was to verify digital skills of chemistry teachers in the classroom before and after training within the project. Chemistry teachers participated in research through self-evaluation questionnaire. Presented research results indicate that the content in module 3 – Application of DT in chemistry teaching at secondary schools was built well, since it supports the development of <b>digital</b> competencies and <b>confidence</b> of teachers in the use of DT as well as development of new teaching skills with the support of DT. It is valuable that teachers are aware of the importance and the need to develop skills for learning with the support of DT. Their self-confidence has improved by 1 to 1. 5 point in the assessment scale as the result of training within the project. On the other side, the system of active teacher with the support of DT is nowadays still preferred over the system based on student activity in the learning process with the use of DT, where the teacher has to manage the learning process directed to personalize learning by using DT – „education tailored to the needs of each pupil“...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} Higher Education {{teachers}} were offered new mobile devices {{with very few}} conditions attached. The aim was to introduce staff to mobile technology and {{how it could be}} used to support teaching and learning within a small, interdisciplinary campus. The study hypothesized that by offering staff the simple incentive of new mobile devices for professional and private use, they will be keener to adopt new practices. The only conditions required were the adoption of two items of software – SharePoint as a file repository, and the VLE provider’s mobile learning application which provides access to the VLE for both learners and staff. There were three stages to the project; Stage 1 involved presenting staff the results of student feedback from their own courses, where the students set out their preferences for using learning technologies. Stage 2 involved surveying staff opinions on the impact of the mobile devices once they were issued. Stage 3 followed up with a selection of interviews, focussing on concepts of interest gained from the questionnaires. Overall results from this study suggested there was an undeniable enthusiasm amongst teaching staff for using mobile technology, however there were still issues surrounding <b>digital</b> <b>confidence</b> and the pedagogical reasoning for integrating such technologies. There is still a divide on the role of mobile technologies within the classroom, most likely stemmed from the lack of knowledge surrounding their potential purpose. In conclusion, staff enthusiasm alone is not enough to result in adoption and integration of mobile technology within teaching and learning, there must be a focus on pedagogy and relevance for teaching staff to engage fully...|$|E

Both acts occurred in time when there was no Internet and peoples’ stories took years to collect and decades for their weight to carry the public momentum required to gain a public apology. Now, in a digital age, the reports and the testimonies held within them are available for all to read on the Internet. We all now know what happened and formal public apologies ensued. Both public apologies also draw attention to an emerging intersection between digital technologies, personal historical stories and public apology. Research has identified the potential of digital narrative, such as digital storytelling 3 and videoed oral histories to assist in the production of digital narratives that can help to present the multiple voices and viewpoints of those affected by these subjects co-creatively (Burgess et al, pp. 152 - 153).

40|$|M. Ed. (ICT in Education) Marc Prensky (2009) {{described}} {{the future as}} being “unimaginably complex”. The rapid development of technology contributes to this complexity {{of the future and}} {{is an integral part of}} the changing world. Learning technologies should therefore be a vital part of education that is aimed to prepare and equip learners, regardless their age, for the world and the future. I am of the opinion that education should therefore co-evolve with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The constant increase in the variety and complexity of available ICTs makes on-going research in the field of learning technologies essential. However the quality of this research is constantly criticised (Jones & Binhui, 2011). Demands for more robust research studies are forcing research to become more complex, difficult and time-consuming but can lead to wisdom (Prensky, 2009). This research project focused on the attainment of digital wisdom to the benefit of adults that who are inexperienced technology users, specifically postgraduate education students who are also teachers. A generational debate regarding the use of ICTs in education, originated around the start of the new millennium when Marc Prensky (2001) made declarations concerning the influence that the presence and use of technology can have on various aspects of peoples’ lives. Prensky (2001) was one of the first to imply a generational division in this regard when he named young people who use <b>digital</b> technology with <b>confidence</b> because they grew up with, and were surrounded by it since the day they were born, “digital natives”. In contrast he called the adult generation “digital immigrants”. He based the distinction between these two generations on the metaphor of language, claiming that a digital immigrant will always retain a “foreign accent” when using technology while digital natives use technology with the same ease that they speak their mother tongue. Prensky proposed that the digital native generation have different expectations of life in general, and also more specifically of learning [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This study complicates American youths' digital {{culture by}} {{analyzing}} the digital practices, perceptions, and experiences of students, ages 18 to 24, attending Frederick Community College in Frederick, Maryland, through an interdisciplinary lens that infuses intersectional theory with Bourdieu's triad of habitus, field, and capital. Mixed methods research combining data from the FCC Digital Practices Survey and focus group interviews indicated that community college youths engaged in a spectrum of practices to socialize and communicate, engage in entertainment and creative practices, and manage everyday life, information, school, and work. Community college youths actively participated in digital culture through social networking, listening to music, watching television, playing videogames, and engaging with other technology. Not only did they feel pressured to adapt digitally, they also intentionally disengaged from technology, managed their lives using digital tools, resolved communication conflicts, monitored their online identities and privacy, developed various forms of digital expertise, and observed the impacts of adults' struggles with technology {{at home and in}} the classroom. Data patterns, including differences between males and females, and among youths with different racial and ethnic identities, revealed contradictions among their everyday <b>digital</b> practices, their <b>confidence</b> with performing these practices, and their perceptions of practices' importance in college and in their future everyday lives and work. This study theorizes the impacts of these contradictions, proposing that as youths encounter shifts in the symbolic value of digital practices between their everyday digital culture and the field of education, they experience what Clarke et al. (2009) termed "digital dissonance," conflicts between their everyday digital practices and their digital engagement in education. Impacts of digital dissonance, which range from resolution and circumnavigation, to digital stagnation and immobilization, affect the uneven positions youths take up within the field of community college education and potentially result in the unintended reproduction of social inequity. To disrupt the reproduction of inequity, this study considers the material consequences of digital immobilization for community college youths and advocates for intentional reform and research that mobilizes their digital practices...|$|R
40|$|The {{human need}} to create, manage and control {{information}} and communication remains constant. It could be said books and Blackboard sites are different ways of {{doing the same thing}} and the gap between Gutenberg and Google is not as wide as it might first appear. In 370 BC Plato has Socrates bemoaning the introduction of writing as damaging to human memory. In 1981 Neil Postman predicted the rise of cable television would result in us all amusing ourselves to death. Back in 15 th century Europe the printing press caused such alarm the Catholic Church introduced censorship; all books were to be approved before publication. It’s not unusual for new technologies to be heralded with doom and gloom. Marc Prensky’s concept of Digital Natives Digital Immigrants could come into this category. In 2001 he offered a provocative but enduring image of technology as the agent of changing brains and behaviors of young people. While his ideas have since been challenged the myth of the digital native remains persistent. Young people are imagined to be tech savvy while older ones struggle. I deliver a postgraduate course Teaching and Learning in a Digital Age (TELEDA) which is taught and assessed through Blackboard. TELEDA aims to create an experiential insight for staff into the loneliness of the long distance learner. It offers a valuable insight into how Blackboard is used across the institution. Digital education is also the subject of my Phd where I’m using an educational design research methodology to work alongside colleagues in the mutual discovery of appropriate support for digitally literate pedagogic practice. Many participants are low Blackboard users but looking to extend their face to face teaching to blended or part time off campus provision. The TELEDA course begins with Prensky’s Digital Natives Digital Immigrants paper and online discussions get lively because everyone has a view on Prensky. Even colleagues initially unsure about contributing to virtual conversations find their nerves are partially overcome because they {{have something to say about}} the need to support individual digital literacies and how they cannot be taken for granted. My experience of ‘teaching the teachers’ on Blackboard confirms my day to day practice as a coordinator of <b>digital</b> education. <b>Confidence</b> and competence with learner technologies cannot be anticipated. Early, mid or late career is no predictor of Blackboard use and engagement. There are older people comfortable with online collaborative working and younger ones unsure of how to insert a picture or attach a file. This presentation suggests digital literacies are too often assumed rather than addressed. Where technology plays a prominent role in people’s lives, it can create digital closeting which prevents awareness of the full spectrum of digital engagement. My presentation examines the myth of digital competence, where those who teach and support learning are employed for their subject specialisms rather than their digital literacies, and calls for meaningful communication between those who support, maintain and mandate the technology and those who use it as a part of their day to day teaching practice.
