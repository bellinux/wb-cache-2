By Michelle S. Birdsall Improved mobility and reduced fuel consumption {{are some of the}} most compelling benefits of appropriately operated and maintained <b>traffic</b> <b>signals.</b> Improved signal timing can yield reductions in traffic delay ranging from 15 to 40 percent; reductions in travel time up to 25 percent; reductions in fuel consumption up to 10 percent; and reductions in harmful emissions up to 22 percent. 1 The benefits also extend to safety, public transit, pedestrians and freight movement. While <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> timing projects produce one of the highest benefit-cost ratios for improvement to the highway transportation system, findings from the 2007 National <b>Traffic</b> <b>Signal</b> Report Card indicate that, overall, <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> operations in the United States score a D grade, up slightly from a D- grade reported in 2005. 2 With the majority of <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> systems across the United States having the potential for vastly improved performance, the need for guidance and resources for <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> timing programs has never been greater.

40|$|Adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control, which adjusts <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> timing {{according}} to real-time traffic, {{has been shown}} to be an effective method to reduce traffic congestion. Available works on adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control make responsive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control decisions based on human-crafted features (e. g. vehicle queue length). However, human-crafted features are abstractions of raw traffic data (e. g., position and speed of vehicles), which ignore some useful traffic information and lead to suboptimal <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controls. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that automatically extracts all useful features (machine-crafted features) from raw real-time traffic data and learns the optimal policy for adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control. To improve algorithm stability, we adopt experience replay and target network mechanisms.

40|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>signal</b> {{conspicuity}} {{is likely}} to be a factor behind difficulties in detecting <b>traffic</b> <b>signals.</b> There is increasing interest in South Australia in providing mast arm mounted <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> at intersections to increase <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> conspicuity and reduce specific crash types. This report aims to review best practice principles in the conspicuity of <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> and determine the extent to which poor conspicuity of <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> contributes to crashes at signalised intersections. Without any recent Australian studies, it is difficult to determine the extent to which crashes result from a failure to detect <b>traffic</b> <b>signals.</b> According to best practice principles, the installation of additional <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> on mast arms at intersections has potential to improve <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> conspicuity. The second aim of this report is to attempt to quantify any road safety benefits in terms of crash reductions for installing additional <b>signals,</b> specifically <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> on mast arms at intersections. Research evidence from a number of evaluations shows that the installation of mast arms at intersections is associated with effects ranging from an estimated 89 per cent reduction in the total number of crashes to a 21 per cent increase in crashes. The greatest crash reductions were reported for right angle crashes (15 - 100 %) while left turn crashes (equivalent to right turn in Australia) were associated with small crash reductions. Although this review shows that mast arms were associated with some crash reductions, it is important to note that these findings are not conclusive as many of the evaluations suffered from poor methodological design.

40|$|Abstract—Real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> {{control is}} an {{integral}} part of the urban traffic control system, and providing effective real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control for a large complex traffic network is an extremely challenging distributed control problem. This paper adopts the multiagent system approach to develop distributed unsupervised <b>traffic</b> responsive <b>signal</b> control models, where each agent in the system is a local <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controller for one intersection in the traffic network. The first multiagent system is developed using hybrid computational intelligent techniques. Each agent employs a multistage online learning process to update and adapt its knowledge base and decision-making mechanism. The second multiagent system is developed by integrating the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation theorem in fuzzy neural networks (NN). The problem of real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control is especially challenging if the agents are used for an infinite horizon problem, where online learning has to take place continuously once the agent-based <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controllers are implemented into the traffic network. A comprehensive simulation model of a section of the Central Business District of Singapore has been developed using PARAMICS microscopic simulation program. Simulation results show that the hybrid multiagent system provides significant improvement in traffic conditions when evaluated against an existing <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control algorithm as well as the SPSA-NN-based multiagent system as the complexity of the simulation scenario increases. Using the hybrid NN-based multiagent system, the mean delay of each vehicle was reduced by 78 % and the mean stoppage time, by 85 % compared to the existing <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control algorithm. The promising results demonstrate the efficacy of the hybrid NN-based multiagent system in solving large-scale <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control problems in a distributed manner.

40|$|While <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> are {{necessary}} to safely control competing flows of traffic, they inevitably enforce a stop-and-go movement pattern that increases fuel consumption, reduces traffic flow and causes traffic jams. These side effects can be alleviated by providing drivers and their onboard computational devices (e. g., vehicle computer, smartphone) with information about the schedule of the <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> ahead. Based on when the signal ahead will turn green, drivers can then adjust speed {{so as to avoid}} coming to a complete halt. Such information is called Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA). Alternatively, the onboard computational device may suggest an efficient detour that will save the driver from stops and long waits at red lights ahead. This paper introduces and evaluates SignalGuru, a novel software service that relies solely on a collection of mobile phones to detect and predict the <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> schedule, enabling GLOSA and other novel applications.

30|$|Research {{has gained}} a {{significant}} advance {{in the development of}} routing protocols for wireless ad hoc networks [1, 2]. The movement pattern of mobile nodes {{plays an important role in}} the performance analysis of mobile and wireless networks. Additionally, mobility has a major effect on the route stability and availability. For example, to maintain communication, <b>signaling</b> <b>traffic</b> is needed for route construction and subsequent route maintenance. The <b>extra</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>traffic</b> over the air interface consumes radio resources, and it increases the interferences that affect the performance of other mobile nodes. Therefore, movement modeling is an essential building block in analytical and simulation-based studies of such systems. Moreover, some researchers [3, 4] have observed that the performance of routing algorithms may be influenced by the choice of mobility models. For example, random models are not a good choice to simulate the real-world mobility scenarios because usually mobile users either move toward certain attraction points such as classrooms or train stations, or move in certain directions such as vehicles. Some attempts have been made to implement specific mobility scenarios that are more realistic [5 – 7]. However, implementing a generic and a realistic mobility model is challenging because the mobility requirement in MANET changes due to the application environments. Indeed, devising a realistic mobility model that accurately reflects actual user mobility is a key challenge in evaluating the performance of any routing algorithm, and it has a significant effect on the obtained results. If the model is unrealistic, invalid conclusions may be drawn.|$|R
