40|$|Policymakers in the UK {{and beyond}} {{have sought to}} promote {{interventions}} to encourage social capital-building among disadvantaged groups. One specific concern is that those with limited access to social capital/social network relationships will be {{at greater risk of}} experiencing both unemployment and poverty. By analyzing longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), we seek to identify significant relationships between poverty and the likelihood of <b>entering</b> <b>employment,</b> and different measures of ‘sociability’ and social isolation. Crucially, we discuss if and how measures of sociability/social isolation are associated with jobseekers' varying chances of exiting and re-entering work and how this varies with their experience of poverty. These issues are important because if sociability impacts on the likelihood of <b>entering</b> <b>employment</b> from a state of worklessness, then policymakers need to understand how cycles of social and labour market exclusion are associated with the rates of <b>entering</b> <b>employment</b> in order <b>to</b> develop effective interventions to improve jobseekers' employability and combat poverty. Following an analysis of BHPS data, we identify lessons for policy for combating long-term unemployment and promoting social inclusion...|$|R

50|$|The MPAJA was {{formally}} dissolved on 1 December 1945.

British authorities discovered that most of the surrendered arms were old-type weapons and suspected that the MPAJA hid the newer weapons in the jungles. One particular incident reinforced this suspicion when the British army stumbled upon an armed Chinese settlement that had its own governing body, military drilling facilities and flag while conducting a raid on one of the old MPAJA encampments. Members of this settlement open fired at the British soldiers on sight, and the skirmish ended with one Chinese man dead.|$|R

30|$|Key {{features}} of typical unemployment insurance and Income Assistance programs are {{incorporated in the}} model as follows. First, individuals face time limitations regarding entry to and exit from the unemployment system. Individuals who <b>enter</b> <b>employment</b> from Income Assistance or who have exhausted their unemployment benefits become eligible to receive unemployment benefits after I months of employment. The number of benefit months subsequently increases by one month for each additional month of employment, from a minimum of u months up {{to a maximum of}} u̅ months. Workers who <b>enter</b> <b>employment</b> with unused benefits retain their unused benefit months and accumulate additional months with each month worked. Second, individuals who exhaust their unemployment benefits and do not secure a job are assumed to transit directly to Income Assistance. Finally, it is assumed that individuals can remain on Income Assistance indefinitely or transit <b>to</b> <b>employment</b> if they contact a firm with a vacancy; Income Assistance recipients cannot transit directly from IA to unemployment. In the following sections, we describe the problems faced by individuals in each labor force state in the model.|$|R

40|$|While more {{mothers have}} been {{participating}} in the paid workforce over recent years, the employment rate of lone mothers remains {{lower than that of}} couple mothers. Concerns about the wellbeing of adults and children living in jobless households contribute to continuing interest in explaining the relatively low employment rate of lone mothers. This paper provides new insights into possible reasons for the different rates of employment of lone and couple mothers by examining how their employment transitions vary. A focus on transitions enables us to examine whether the lower employment rate of lone mothers is due to their being less likely <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>employment,</b> more likely <b>to</b> exit <b>employment</b> once employed, or a combination of both. Monthly calendar data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey are used to identify and compare the rate at which lone and couple mothers move into and out of employment over a seven-year period. These data show that in any one-month period, lone mothers {{are less likely to be}} employed than couple mothers. Of those employed in a one-month period, lone mothers are more likely to transition out of employment than couple mothers; however, not-employed lone and couple mothers are no different in their likelihood of transition into employment. The analyses also consider the extent to which a selection of factors other than lone parenthood differentiate mothers in their employment transition rates. These analyses show that educational attainment, work history and age of youngest child may influence, in part, the different employment transition rates of lone and couple mothers.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{an intervention}} in Europe which enables untypical individuals to acquire {{skills and competences}} in order <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> IT related <b>employment.</b> <b>To</b> do this they need to acquire a threshold level of intellectual capital {{so that they are}} considered sufficiently competent <b>to</b> gain <b>employment.</b> This can therefore provide the industry with a solid foundation of the necessary support staff, capable of providing services to the local community supporting such educational initiatives. This initiative can then release the more conventionally educated to work {{at the cutting edge of}} industry. As a driver for wealth generation in India, the IT industry is remarkable. It demands a wide spectrum of intellectual capital. As diffusion of IT technology is predicted to pervade throughout the subcontinent, the demand for all levels of competence would seem to be buoyant. The training environment covered in this case study complements the traditional educational system and could furnish alternative career opportunities to certain sections of the community. This paper takes a strategic view throughout. The fallacy of composition has to be taken seriously. What is true for a part is not true of the whole. To place this in the context of this paper; whilst a workshop to help unemployed people build computers in Sheffield may work, it is not necessarily appropriate to draw the conclusions that it will be effective when implemented over the whole of the Indian Subcontinent...|$|R

40|$|This report updates a 1981 {{study of}} {{mortality}} at three United Kingdom chromate producing factories, and pays {{special attention to}} workers engaged after major plant and process changes were completed during 1958 - 60. The study covers 2298 payroll workers in post on 1 January 1950 or <b>entering</b> <b>employment</b> up <b>to</b> 30 June 1976 and remaining at least one year, with mortality observed up to 31 December 1988. Expected numbers of deaths were calculated from national death rates adjusted for social class and area differences. At the two largest factories 1422 men starting work before the process changes showed a highly significant excess of deaths from lung cancer (observed deaths/adjusted expected deaths (obs/expA) 175 / 88. 97, adjusted standardised mortality ratio (SMRA) 197). They also had a significant excess of deaths from nasal cancer (obs/expA 4 / 0. 26, SMRA 1538); the four affected men all had over 20 years of employment. Six hundred and seventy seven men starting work {{after the completion of}} process changes showed no excess of lung cancer deaths (obs/expA 14 / 13. 7, SMRA 102, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 56 - 171), but the possibility of the risk persisting at a reduced level cannot be excluded. The risk among earlier entrants affected men with two or more years of employment and was highest among those working for 10 years or longer (SMRA 225). The relative risk was already raised 5 - 14 years after first employment; it was highest in the 25 - 40 year period, but was still raised 50 years after first exposure. The risk showed most clearly at young ages, with a SMRA of 355 for ages under 50 (obs/expA 21 / 5. 91). The excess was greater among men in jobs with high exposure to chromates (obs/expA 151 / 61. 73, SMRA 245) than among men in less exposed jobs (obs/expA 21 / 19. 57, SMRA 107). Less evidence of a lung cancer excess was found among 199 men employed at a third small factory (obs/expA 12 / 9. 91, SMRA 121). No risk was apparent in further groups of 214 salaried works staff (obs/expA 1 / 2. 53), or 95 workers at an adjacent fertiliser plant (obs/expA 3 / 3. 95).
