5|$|The Battle of Khafji was {{the first}} major ground {{engagement}} of the Gulf War. It took place in and around the Saudi Arabian city of Khafji, from 29 January to 1 February 1991 and marked the culmination of the Coalition's air campaign over <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iraq,</b> which had begun on 17 January 1991.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the engagements between 29 January and 1 February, the Coalition did not launch its main {{offensive}} into <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iraq</b> until the night of 24–25 February. The invasion of Iraq was completed about 48 hours later. The Battle of Khafji served as a modern example of the ability of air power to serve a supporting role to ground forces. It offered the Coalition an indication of the manner in which Operation Desert Storm would be fought, but also hinted at future friendly-fire casualties which accounted for nearly half of the American dead.|$|E

50|$|The mission changed again 23 January. With {{most of the}} {{strategic}} targets eliminated, the 10th TFS received orders to concentrate on Iraq's Republican Guard units occupying <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iraq's</b> southern region. For the Al Dhafra-based crews, this meant bombing any military targets {{on the road and}} destroying any pontoon bridges being constructed across the Tigris River. In addition, the wing's crews dropped leaflet bombs over Iraqi positions and civilian centers. For the next month, emphasis centered on counter-SCUD operations and preparing the battlefield for the eventual ground war.|$|R
50|$|The {{greatest}} war fought by the West in the 1990s, however, was the Persian Gulf War. In 1990, the Middle Eastern {{nation of}} Iraq, under its brutal dictator Saddam Hussein, invaded the much smaller neighbouring country of Kuwait. After refusing to withdraw troops, the United Nations condemned <b>Iraq</b> <b>and</b> sent troops to liberate Kuwait. American, British, French, Egyptian and Syrian troops all {{took part in}} the liberation. The war ended in 1991, with the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iraq's</b> agreement to allow United Nations inspectors to search {{for weapons of mass destruction}} in Iraq.|$|R

25|$|Cooperation {{between the}} United States and the Soviet Union made {{possible}} the passage of resolutions in the United Nations Security Council giving Iraq a deadline to leave Kuwait and approving {{the use of force}} if Saddam did not comply with the timetable. U.S. officials feared Iraqi retaliation against oil-rich Saudi Arabia, since the 1940s a close ally of Washington, for the Saudis' opposition to the invasion of Kuwait. Accordingly, the U.S. and a group of allies, including countries as diverse as Egypt, Syria and Czechoslovakia, deployed a massive amount of troops along the Saudi border with <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iraq</b> in order to encircle the Iraqi army, the largest in the Middle East.|$|E
