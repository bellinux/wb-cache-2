5000|$|Another major {{limitation}} of the electrokinetics process is the decrease the electric potential of the system. Different polarization effects can decrease how the system runs.

Resistance polarization can occur after the <b>electrokinetic</b> <b>remediation</b> process has started a white layer can be observed. Just like in hard water stains this layer may be the insoluble salt and other impurities that inhibit conductivity.

5000|$|<b>Electrokinetic</b> <b>remediation</b> {{is applied}} to many {{contaminants}} that can be dissolved within groundwater. Heavy metals {{are one of the}} main contaminants that are removed by the electrokinetics process. Some metals like cadmium (II) can be removed with high consequences on energy expenditure. Chromium (III) can be removed but with low efficiency because of the ease of hydrolysis allowing it to sorb to other substances. Chromium (IV) is also a candidate for electrokinetics removal although chromium (IV) migration is retarded in the presence of sulfur because it will break down into chromium (III). [...] Other heavy metal species that are tested and reported to be treatable include; mercury, zinc, iron, lead, copper, and magnesium. Electrokinetics is also possible with alkali and alkaline earth metals which travel faster in most mediums than heavy metals. At tests between 20 to 30 volts, alkali metals were known to move between 50 to 60 cm per day per volts whereas heavy metal moved at velocities between 10 and 20 cm per day per volts. It is possible that this difference could be because of the slow desorption and dissolution of heavy metals. Electrokinetics {{can also be used to}} treat polar organic compounds (phenol and acetic acid) and radionucleotides (radium), toxic anions (nitrates and sulfates), dense, non-aqueous-phase liquids (DNAPLs), cyanide, petroleum hydrocarbons (diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene and lubricating oils), halogenated pollutants, explosives, halogenated and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|E

40|$|AbstractElectrokinetics is a developping {{technology}} that is intended to separate and extract heavy metals, radionuclides, and organic contaminants from saturated or unsaturated soils, sludges and sediments, and groundwater. The goal of <b>electrokinetic</b> <b>remediation</b> is to effect the migration of subsurface contaminants in an imposed electric field. This technique is known as <b>electrokinetic</b> <b>remediation,</b> electroreclamation, electrochemical decontamination, electrorestoration, electromigration or electrochemical soil processing. Electrokinetics involves the installation of electrodes into the subsurface surrounding the contaminated region. After the electrodes are in place, a low electrical potential is applied across the anode(s) (positively charged electrode) and the cathode(s) (negatively charged electrode). As {{a result of the}} electrical gradient, different physico-chemical reactions occur and contaminant transport occurs due to various mechanisms within the soil and groundwater. Generally, for the migration to be significant, the contaminants should be in a soluble form. If they are not soluble, they need to be desorbed, dissolved, and/or solubilized into the pore solution before they can be adequately transported from the soil to an electrode wells/reservoirs. Different types of contaminants have been investigated and research has been conducted to optimize the electrokinetic variables. The present study was undertaken to systematically investigate the effect of initial sludge water content, and heating on the <b>electrokinetic</b> <b>remediation</b> of alumium-contaminated sludge.

Technology Description <b>Electrokinetic</b> <b>remediation</b> is an in-situ process in which an electrical field is created in a soil matrix by applying a low-voltage direct current (DC) to electrodes placed in the soil (Figure 1). The current density is generally on the order of milliamperes per square centimeter (mA/cm) or an electric potential difference on the order of a few volts per centimeter across electrodes placed in the ground. Figure 1 : General Schematic of <b>Electrokinetic</b> <b>Remediation</b> The electrodes can be placed in either a vertical or horizontal array. When DC current is applied to the electrodes, an electrical field develops between the anodes and cathodes. The application of the electric field has several effects on the soil, water, and contaminants. These effects include electromigration, electroosmosis, changes in pH, and electrophoresis. Electromigration refers to the movement of cations and anions {{under the influence of the}} electrical field. Cations (positively charged ions) tend to migrate towards the negatively charged cathode, and anions (negatively charged ions) migrate towards the positively charged anode.

40|$|This {{study is}} trying to apply a new method in <b>remediation</b> <b>electrokinetic</b> byinserting {{conductive}} solution between cathode and soil to be treated. This is purposed in keeping the pH in low condition and preventing the precipitation of heavy metals in the soil adjacent to the cathode that often happen in the previous electrokinetic methods. Concentration of Pb (C 0), period (t), concentration of conductive solution were selected as parameters, both with artificially contaminated sand and naturally contaminated soil experiments. The experiment with natural soil C 0 = 975 ppm gave lower efficiency at 32, 84 % when it compares with sand as the medium, with the experiment in the same condition at 87, 68 %. Concentration of KCl also influenced theperformance of system which was shown by the increasing in removal efficiency. The double increase of conductive solution concentration does not proportionally increase the flux of Pb. Although desorption in the natural soil take time longer than in the sand the removal efficiency relatively low. This {{is caused by the}} immobile state of Pb in the natural soil and the complexity of chemical reaction between heavy metals with surface of soil particle...|$|R
