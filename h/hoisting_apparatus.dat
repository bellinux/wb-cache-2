60|$|SAFETY-CLUTCH, n. A {{mechanical}} device acting automatically {{to prevent the}} fall of an elevator, or cage, {{in case of an}} accident to the <b>hoisting</b> <b>apparatus.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{circular}} car {{which was}} intended to {{move up and down}} the shaft, and the peculiar machinery connected with it, with the <b>hoisting</b> <b>apparatus,</b> were all made in his Works. His skilled artisans labored steadily day and night.|$|E
60|$|When {{the iceberg}} had been reached, {{several of the}} party ascended with a <b>hoisting</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and with this the rod was hauled {{to the top and}} set up perpendicularly on a central spot at the summit of the iceberg, the pointed end downward, and a bomb of great power {{fastened}} to its upper end. This bomb was one designed to exert its whole explosive power in one direction, and it was so placed that this force would be exerted downward. When all was ready, the electric-wire attachment to the bomb was carried down the iceberg and carefully laid on the ice as the party returned to the Dipsey.|$|E
5000|$|The {{northern}} most (No 1 in RA terms) contained <b>hoist</b> <b>apparatus</b> for lifting shells {{from the}} storage magazines below. It was surmounted, in World War II, by a Bren gun position - since removed.|$|R
50|$|Sutton did not {{complete}} his PhD in Zoology as he originally planned. At the age of 26, {{he returned to the}} Kansas oil fields for 2 years. There he was able to perfect a device to start large gas engines with high pressure-gas and develop <b>hoisting</b> <b>apparatuses</b> for deep wells. Sutton’s mechanical aptitudes never left him. His father finally directed him to return to his medical studies and he did so returning to Columbia University in 1905.|$|R
40|$|Maudslay, Sons & Field {{supplied}} the apparatus {{for the first}} public time ball, which became operational at Greenwich, England, in 1833 and included a chain hoist for the ball. In Australia, Maudslay's built the time ball apparatus for Sydney, NSW, but with a rack and pinion <b>hoist.</b> The 1877 <b>apparatus</b> for Newcastle, NSW {{was derived from the}} Sydney design and built in Australia. The 1875 apparatus for Semaphore, South Australia is deduced to be a development of a design by Charles Todd who was responsible at Greenwich for time ball operation before his departure for Adelaide in 1855 and who had a high regard for Maudslay's. Like that at Greenwich it used a chain hoist, but explicit statements about its designer and manufacturer have not yet been found. It is likely that Semaphore had the first heavy-duty time ball apparatus to be manufactured in Australia and that its design was rooted in Maudslay's experience. Roger Kinns & Lesley Abel...|$|R
50|$|As {{the main}} {{building}} rose, Bradford devoted {{much attention to the}} tower. The original purpose of this dominant feature was to accommodate stone steps to each floor. At Bradford’s urging, the plans were altered to incorporate wooden steps and <b>hoisting</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and an elevator to move supplies more easily among the floors. As finally constructed, the tower was a duplicate of the one attached to the Indianapolis arsenal.|$|E
5000|$|Never {{intended}} for residence, the Hermitage Hunting Lodge was {{built as a}} setting for hosting royal banquets during hunts in Dyrehaven, which surrounds the building. It originally featured a <b>hoisting</b> <b>apparatus</b> able to hoist the table from the basement to the dining room, allowing the King and his guests to dine without any waiters present, or [...] "en ermitage" [...] (in solitude), hence {{the name of the}} castle. The apparatus was removed in the late 18th century as it was causing endless mechanical problems, and no signs of it remain. The previous castle on the site, the Hubertus chalet, had a similar apparatus and was nicknamed [...] for the same reason.|$|E
50|$|Great {{improvements}} {{were also}} {{made in the}} <b>hoisting</b> <b>apparatus</b> and cages used to extract ore and transport the miners to their work. As {{the depth of the}} diggings increased, the hemp ropes used to haul ore to the surface became impractical, as their self-weight became a significant fraction of their tensile strength (breaking weight). After hemp rope, iron chains began to become more common. However, fracture was quick, at around half a millisecond. In 1829 Wilhelm Albert had studied and reported on the failure of the iron chains and began creating a twisted metal cabling known as Albert Rope. In 1864 Andrew Smith Hallidie manufactured wire rope and was heavily involved in building early cable bridges and ropeway conveyors; his wire rope went on to be used in San Francisco's famous cable cars, and was also added to the cable drums in the hoist houses on the Comstock Lode. Another innovation, were spring loaded cages. The only way {{in and out of a}} shaft mine, was in the cage, cabled to the hoist.|$|E
40|$|This work dissert about {{proposal}} and calculation hoisting device travelling crab, intended for tonnage 50 000 kg. For this tonnage there're performed pertinent strenght calculations, concerning journal of pullies, side plate, crossbeam and crane hook. Part {{of work is}} proposal desirable electric motor, gear - box, brakes, jaw clutch and bearings. In work are also descriptions of <b>hoisting</b> <b>apparatus</b> and descriptions of construction parts of sheave block. Defined are also main dimensions ancillary components for desired hoisting. Work is finished with complete drawing documentation of sheave block travelling crab...|$|E
