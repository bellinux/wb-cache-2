5|$|After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, {{the ship}} was used {{primarily}} to train gunners and engine room personnel, as the US Navy had expanded significantly to combat the German U-boat campaign. She escorted convoys in late 1918, {{and after the war}} ended she took part in the <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> American soldiers back from France. New Hampshire remained in service for only a few years after the war, as the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty significantly reduced the navies of the signatories; as a result, {{the ship was}} sold for scrap in November 1923.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, Stackpole {{delivered}} the William A.

That same year, Stackpole traveled to Mexico City to see Rivera working on some of his 124 frescoes in the courtyard of the Secretariat of Public Education. Returning with a small Rivera painting, Stackpole gave it to San Francisco Arts Commission president William Gerstle (who was initially unimpressed), and began a several-year <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> Rivera to work in California.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry of}} a new {{ownership}} group of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the offseason that included Branch Rickey affected the Browns' schedule in 1948. Rickey, an executive for baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers, convinced Brown to schedule a late-season road trip during which Cleveland would play three teams in eight days: the New York Yankees, the Los Angeles Dons and the San Francisco 49ers. The plan {{was part of an}} <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> more attention to the AAFC and help attendance by sending its most successful team on a cross-country road trip, a strategy that had worked in baseball.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{attempt to}} bring a {{professional}} ice hockey team to Nottingham was made in 1939 following {{the completion of the}} Ice Stadium in Nottingham City Centre. A team was assembled and brought to the United Kingdom from Canada to compete in the 1939–40 English National League season but were promptly sent home having not played a single game due to the outbreak of World War II. Seven years later, after the war had ended, a second <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> ice hockey to the city was begun. With a team of Canadians largely from Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Nottingham Panthers played their first competitive game on 22 November 1946 with a 3–2 home victory over the Wembley Monarchs.|$|E

5|$|In September 2014, it was {{reported}} that Gröning had been charged by state prosecutors with having been an accessory to murder for his role at Auschwitz receiving and processing prisoners and their personal belongings. The indictment stated that Gröning economically advanced Nazi Germany and aided the systematic killing of 300,000 of the 425,000 Hungarian Jews who were deported to Auschwitz by 137 railway transports during the summer of 1944. Gröning's prosecution has been reported {{to be a part of}} Germany’s final <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the last Nazi war-crimes suspects to justice. State prosecutors managed to charge the defendant on a legal precedent set in 2011 by the conviction of the former Sobibor extermination camp guard John Demjanjuk by a court in Munich.|$|E
5|$|John led an {{expedition}} to Ireland in 1210 in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the Anglo-Norman barons under control. He opened talks with the native Irish kings, and some accounts state that his negotiations were so successful that the native Irish submitted to him. In contrast, the historian Seán Duffy {{has argued that the}} native Irish nobility were just as resistant to John as the Anglo-Norman barons. After John's return to England he ordered de Gray to build three new castles in Connacht, one of them at Athlone. Associated with the castle building were two military invasions of Connacht by the royal government– one from Meath and Leinster and the other from Munster. De Gray left Ireland in 1211 to lead a military campaign against the Welsh, leaving his deputy Richard de Tuit in charge of the country.|$|E
5|$|On December 10, 1943, SEC {{officials}} met in Nashville in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> a full football schedule {{back for}} the 1944 season. In order to have enough students eligible to participate on a team, the SEC changed its eligibility restrictions to allow for any civilian to play {{as long as they}} had not played four years of college football or professionally. At that time, Alabama along with Tennessee and Vanderbilt indicated they might reform their respective teams and resume conference play for the 1944 season. On January 12, 1944, all SEC members, with the exceptions of Mississippi and Mississippi State, indicated their intent to field football teams the following fall. On May 19, 1944, every SEC school with the exception of Vanderbilt (who fielded an informal team) agreed to play a full conference schedule the following fall. Football officially returned to Alabama {{for the first time since}} the 1942 season on September 30, 1944, when the Crimson Tide played LSU to a tie in their season opener.|$|E

5|$|By 4 August, a {{perimeter}} {{was established}} around Pusan {{on the hills}} {{to the north of}} the city and the Naktong River to the west. The Eighth Army, including the 24th Infantry Division, was cornered by the surrounding North Korean army. With UN forces concentrated and North Korean supply lines stretched out, the 24th Infantry Division halted the advance of the North Koreans. The 24th Division was at Naktong, with the 25th Infantry Division to the south, and the 1st Cavalry Division and South Korean forces to the north. The 24th Division was also reinforced by the 2nd Infantry Division, newly arrived in the theater. The 24th was quickly sent to block the North Korean 6th Infantry Division, which attempted to attack the UN forces from the southwest. On 8 August, the North Korean 4th Infantry Division crossed the river and attempted to penetrate the perimeter. After 10 days of fighting, the 24th Infantry Division counterattacked and forced the North Koreans back across the river. By late August 1950, only 184 of the 34th Regiment's original 1,898 men remained. The regiment was dissolved and was replaced within the 24th by the 5th Regimental Combat Team. The 34th Regiment's survivors were added to the ranks of the 19th and 21st regiments in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> them up to strength, and the 5th Infantry remained with the 24th Division until the division withdrew from Korea. Elements of the 24th Infantry Division were moved into reserve on 23 August and replaced by the 2nd Infantry Division. A second, larger North Korean attack occurred between 31 August and 19 September, but the 2nd, 24th, and 25th infantry divisions and the 1st Cavalry Division beat the North Koreans back across the river again.|$|E
