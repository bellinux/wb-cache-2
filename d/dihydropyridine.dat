40|$|Depolarization of NG 108 - 15 (neuroblastoma-glioma) cells causes an {{increase}} in 45 Ca 2 + influx. This effect is blocked by low concentrations of <b>dihydropyridines</b> such as nitrendipine and by other blockers of voltage-sensitive calcium channels such as D- 600, diltiazem, and Cd 2 +. Two other <b>dihydropyridines,</b> BAY K 8644 and CGP 28392, have the opposite effect. Low concentrations of these compounds enhance depolarization-induced 45 Ca 2 + influxes. BAY K 8644 {{is more effective than}} CGP 28392. Both agents have no effect on fluxes measured under nondepolarizing conditions. The effects of BAY K 8644 and CGP 28392 can be inhibited by nitrendipine, D- 600, diltiazem, or Cd 2 +. Whereas the interaction between nitrendipine and BAY K 8644 is shown to be competitive in nature, that between BAY K 8644 and D- 600 is shown to be noncompetitive. These results indicate that <b>dihydropyridines</b> show a variety of effects on calcium channels, ranging from agonistic through partially agonistic to antagonistic. Moreover, the results also indicate that <b>dihydropyridines</b> and D- 600 exert their effects on calcium channels at different sites...|$|R
25|$|Most {{people who}} have taken {{too much of a}} calcium channel blocker, {{especially}} diltiazem, get slow heart rate and low blood pressure. This can progress to the heart stopping altogether. CCBs of the <b>dihydropyridine</b> group, as well as flunarizine, predominantly cause reflex tachycardia as a reaction to the low blood pressure. For verapamil, despite it having a similar mechanism of action as diltiazem, both fast and slow heart rhythm are described.|$|E
25|$|Unlike beta {{blockers}}, {{calcium channel}} blockers do not decrease the responsiveness {{of the heart}} to input from the sympathetic nervous system. Since moment-to-moment blood pressure regulation is {{carried out by the}} sympathetic nervous system (via the baroreceptor reflex), calcium channel blockers allow blood pressure to be maintained more effectively than do beta blockers. However, because <b>dihydropyridine</b> CCBs result in a decrease in blood pressure, the baroreceptor reflex often initiates a reflexive increase in sympathetic activity leading to increased heart rate and contractility.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} pharmacokinetics, {{cimetidine}} in particular interferes {{with some of}} the body's mechanisms of drug metabolism and elimination through the liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway. To be specific, cimetidine is an inhibitor of the P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4. By reducing the metabolism of drugs through these enzymes, cimetidine may increase their serum concentrations to toxic levels. Many drugs are affected, including warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, lidocaine, quinidine, propranolol, labetalol, metoprolol, methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, some benzodiazepines, <b>dihydropyridine</b> calcium channel blockers, sulfonylureas, metronidazole, and some recreational drugs such as ethanol and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).|$|E

25|$|The Chichibabin {{pyridine}} synthesis {{was reported}} in 1924 and is still in use in industry. In its general form, the reaction {{can be described as}} a condensation reaction of aldehydes, ketones, α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, or any combination of the above, in ammonia or ammonia derivatives. In particular, unsubstituted pyridine is produced from formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which are inexpensive and widely available. First, acrolein is formed in a Knoevenagel condensation from the acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. It is then condensed with acetaldehyde and ammonia into <b>dihydropyridine,</b> and then oxidized with a solid-state catalyst to pyridine. This process is carried out in a gas phase at 400–450°C. The product consists of a mixture of pyridine, simple methylated pyridines (picoline), and lutidine; its composition depends on the catalyst used and can be adapted {{to the needs of the}} manufacturer. The catalyst is usually a transition metal salt such as cadmium(II) fluoride or manganese(II) fluoride, but cobalt and thallium compounds can also be used. The recovered pyridine is separated from byproducts in a multistage process.|$|E

40|$|Characteristics {{of three}} {{different}} calcium antagonist groups: Most important calcium antagonists used to treat cardiovascular disease belong {{to one of three}} main groups, phenylalkylamines, <b>dihydropyridines</b> and benzothiazepines. The best known drug in each group is verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem, respectively. <b>Dihydropyridines</b> are predominantly vasodilators, with little or no primary cardiac activity; the tachycardia caused by these compounds is a reflex phenomenon. Verapamil and related drugs are also vasodilators, with an additional depressant effect on atrioventricular conduction, heart rate and contractility. Diltiazem's pharmacodynamic profile and side effects may be considered as intermediate between those of the <b>dihydropyridines</b> and verapamil. Characteristics of new calcium antagonists: Several new calcium antagonists have been introduced in the last few years, virtually all <b>dihydropyridines.</b> Compared with the older generation of calcium antagonists these newer drugs tend to have (1) a longer duration of action; (2) some selectivity for a specific vascular bed, such as resistance, coronary, renal or cerebral vessels; (3) a potentially useful extra component, such as diuretic or anti-atherogenic activity. Newer calcium antagonists described in this review: The newer compounds briefly characterized in this review are amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, lacidipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine and nitrendipine.

2500|$|Condensation {{reactions}} are another {{route to the}} formation of heterocyclic aromatic systems.

[...] Hantzsch's approach to pyridines dates from 1881 and involves condensation of a β-keto acid or ester with an aldehyde and a nitrogen donor (typicallyammonia or one of its salts. [...] Knoevenagel modified this process for asymmetrically substituted pyridine derivatives.

On addition of sodium ethoxide in ethanol three reactions take place simultaneously: cleavage of the amide to form new an ethyl ester group, displacement of the mesyl group by newly formed BOC protected amine to an aziridine group and an elimination reaction forming the alkene group in 13 with liberation of HBr. In the final two steps the aziridine ring is opened by 3-pentanol 14 and boron trifluoride to aminoether 15 with the BOC group replaced by an acyl group and on removal of the other amine protecting group (Pd/C, Ph3P, and 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid in ethanol) and addition of phosphoric acid oseltamivir 16 is obtained.|$|E

40|$|P-Glycoprotein, {{the plasma}} {{membrane}} protein {{responsible for the}} multidrug resistance of some tumour cells, is an active transporter {{of a number of}} structurally unrelated hydrophobic drugs. We have characterized the modulation of its ATPase activity by a multidrug-resistance-related cytotoxic drug, vinblastine, and different multidrug-resistance-reversing agents, verapamil and the <b>dihydropyridines</b> nicardipine, nimodipine, nitrendipine, nifedipine and azidopine. P-Glycoprotein ATPase activity was measured by using native membrane vesicles containing large amounts of P-glycoprotein, prepared from the highly multidrug-resistant lung fibroblasts DC- 3 F/ADX. P-Glycoprotein ATPase is activated by verapamil and by nicardipine but not by vinblastine. Among the five <b>dihydropyridines</b> tested, the higher the hydrophobicity, the higher was the activation factor with respect to the basal activity and the lower was the half-maximal activating concentration. The vinblastine-specific binding on P-glycoprotein is reported by the inhibitions of the verapamil- and the nicardipine-stimulated ATPase. These inhibitions are purely competitive, which means that the bindings of vinblastine and verapamil, or vinblastine and nicardipine, on P-glycoprotein are mutually exclusive. In contrast, verapamil and nicardipine display mutually non-competitive interactions. This demonstrates the existence of two distinct specific sites for these two P-glycoprotein modulators on which they can bind simultaneously and separately to the vinblastine site. The nicardipine-stimulated ATPase activity {{in the presence of the}} other <b>dihydropyridines</b> shows mixed-type inhibitions. These <b>dihydropyridines</b> have thus different binding sites that interact mutually to decrease their respective, separately determined affinities. This could be due to steric constraints between sites close to each other. This is supported by the observation that vinblastine binding is not mutually exclusive with nifedipine or nitrendipine binding, whereas it is mutually exclusive with nicardipine. Moreover, verapamil binding also interacts with the five <b>dihydropyridines</b> by mixed inhibitions, with different destabilization factors. On the whole our enzymic data show that P-glycoprotein has distinct but interacting binding sites for various modulators of its ATPase function...|$|R

40|$|Dihydropyridine-type {{calcium channel}} antagonists, in {{addition}} to having a vasodilatory effect, are known to inhibit cellular uptake of nucleosides such as adenosine. However, the nucleoside transporter subtypes involved and the mechanism by which this occurs are not known. Therefore, we have studied the inhibitory effects of <b>dihydropyridines</b> on both human equilibrative nucleoside transporters, hENT- 1 and hENT- 2, which are the major transporters mediating nucleoside transport in most tissues. Among the <b>dihydropyridines</b> tested, nimodipine proved to be the most potent inhibitor of hENT- 1, with an IC 50 value of 60 ± 31  μM, whereas nifedipine, nicardipine, nitrendipine, and felodipine exhibited 100 -fold less effective inhibitory activity. Nifedipine, nitrendipine, and nimodipine inhibited hENT- 2 with IC 50 values in the micromolar range; however, nicardipine and felodipine had no significant effect on hENT- 2. Removal of the 4 -aryl ring or changing the nitro group at the 4 -aryl ring proved not to be detrimental to the inhibitory effects of <b>dihydropyridines</b> on hENT- 1, but resulted in a drastic decrease in their inhibitory effects on hENT- 2. Kinetic studies revealed that nimodipine and nifedipine reduced V max of [3 H]uridine transport without affecting K m. The inhibitory effects of nimodipine and nifedipine could be washed out. In addition, nimodipine and nifedipine inhibited the rate of NBTGR-induced dissociation of [3 H]NBMPR from hENT- 1 cell membrane. We conclude that <b>dihydropyridines</b> are non-competitive inhibitors of hENT- 1 and hENT- 2, probably working through reversible interactions with the allosteric sites.
