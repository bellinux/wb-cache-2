40|$|Patent offices {{around the}} world face massive {{backlogs}} of applications, which threatens {{to slow down the}} pace of technological progress. However, economists lack analytical tools to address the issue. This paper provides a model of patent backlog inspired from the traffic congestion literature. Inventors in the cohort are heterogeneous with respect to desired patent pendency duration and react in anticipation of the waiting time resulting from the backlog. They can accelerate or slow down pendency duration by adapting their filing strategy. We find that the backlog impedes patent examination progress by providing incentives to strategically manipulate pendency. We discuss four policy responses: increasing examination capacity; introducing a penalty fee; altering the value of pending applications; and allowing <b>deferred</b> <b>examination...</b>|$|E

40|$|Most patent systems allow {{applicants}} to defer patent examination by some time. <b>Deferred</b> <b>examination</b> {{was introduced in}} the 1960 s, first at the Dutch patent office and subsequently in many other countries, as a response to mounting backlogs of unexamined patent applications. Some applicants allow the examination option to lapse and never request examination once they learn about the value of their invention. Examination loads are reduced substantially in these systems, albeit at the cost of having a large number of pending patent applications. Economic models of patent examination and renewal have largely ignored this important feature to date. We construct a model of patent application, examination and renewal in which applicants have control over the timing of examination and study the tradeoffs that applicants face. Using data from the Canadian patent office and a simulated GMM estimator, we obtain estimates for parameter values of the value distributions and of the learning process. We use our estimates to assess the value of Canadian patents as well as applications. We find that a considerable part of the value is realized before a patent is even granted. In addition, w...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} how a <b>deferred</b> patent <b>examination</b> system promotes ex-ante screening of patent applications, which reduces both {{the number of}} granted patents {{and the use of}} economic resources for examinations, without reducing the return from R&D. Based on a real option theory, we develop a model of examination request behaviors. Exploiting the responses of Japanese firms to recent policy reform, we find that the shortening of the allowable period for an examination request significantly increases both eventual and early requests, controlling for the blocking use of a pending patent application. This effect is stronger in technology areas with higher uncertainty. These results support the importance of uncertainty for an applicant and of ex-ante screening...|$|R
40|$|Murdoch University, in {{collaboration}} with industry partners, has developed a sophisticated middleware application (WebCTMan) between WebCT and other corporate systems, such as the Callista student records system, the Concept 1 human resources system and Murdoch’s own authentication system. This presentation will describe the architecture and functionality of this system. The impetus for WebCTMan was to enable Murdoch to change its student records database with minimal impact on our WebCT installation. However, WebCTMan now gives us great flexibility in managing our WebCT installation, enabling us to manage courses across teaching periods, and upgrade easily. This paper describes {{the context in which}} this system was built and gives an overview of its architecture. Courses in WebCTMan can have a status of active (where student details are updated nightly), inactive (where all students are orphans), and static (where student accounts are valid but not updated). Tools are available to change this status, and easily activate and deactivate courses. Different versions of courses are maintained for each teaching period, resolving the problem of overlap between semesters, when some students still have <b>deferred</b> <b>examinations</b> after {{the start of a new}} semester. In addition to managing students, WebCTMan provides functionality to manage staff and courses. Staff can request courses to be created or cloned from other courses. They can also create their own guest accounts and allocate tutors and markers to courses, and download class lists. Operators can create or rename courses on demand, as well as changing the roles of staff, including primary and secondary designers. A subset of functions is available to helpdesk operators, who can lookup details of both students and staff within the system...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the reliability of}} a delay in the microscopic examination of synovial fluid (SF) to detect and identify crystals. Methods: Ninety one SF samples were examined, 31 with monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, 30 with crystals of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD), and 30 containing no crystals. The specimens were stored with EDTA, sodium heparin, and without anticoagulant at 4 ºC before examination at 24 and 72 hours with ordinary and polarised light microscopy. Another aliquot of the same samples was stored in a plastic container without anticoagulant at − 80 °C and examined after two months. Results: When the samples stored at 4 ºC were re-examined after 24 hours, intracellular crystals of MSU were seen in 90 / 93 (97 %) cases {{where they had been}} identified previously and 89 / 93 (96 %) cases after 72 hours. Similarly, CPPD crystals were identified in 90 / 90 (100 %) and 87 / 90 (97 %) cases after 24 and 72 hours. Examination of the samples stored at − 80 °C showed intracellular MSU crystals in 25 / 31 (81 %) of cases and CPPD crystals in 25 / 30 (83 %). No crystals were seen in any sample which had previously been diagnosed as crystal-free. Conclusions: <b>Deferred</b> microscopic <b>examination</b> of refrigerated or deep frozen SF provides a strong probability of detecting MSU or CPPD crystals if these are present initially...|$|R

NMC requested permanent relief from complying with the following requirements: (1) augmented inspection requirements of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) shell welds at the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant (MNGP), as required by 10 CFR 50. 55 a(g) (6) (ii) (A) (2); and (2) the 10 -Year Interval ISI Requirements for the circumferential welds as required by Inspection Category B-A, Inspection Item B 1. 11 to Table IWB- 2500 - 1 of Article IWB to the 1989 Edition of Section XI of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. As an alternative to these requirements, NMC sought to permanently defer these inspections for the remaining term of the current operating license for MNGP.

40|$|Introduction: Deferrals lead to loss of {{precious}} whole blood donors (WBD) and blood units available for transfusion purposes. Knowledge of rate and causes of donor deferral can guide the recruitment strategy for WBD. Aim: To find the incidence and causes of deferral in Indian WBD and apply relevant findings to modify recruitment strategy for blood donors. Materials and Methods: Data for WBD presenting for donation in a blood center and outdoor camps over one and half year were analyzed retrospectively. National guidelines {{were used for}} selection and deferral of WBD. Result: 736 (11. 6 &#x 0025;) WBD were deferred out of 6357 presenting for donation during the study period. Most (69. 8 &#x 0025;) of the donors were <b>deferred</b> on physical <b>examination</b> and hemoglobin (Hb) testing. Most common reasons for deferral were low Hb (55. 8 &#x 0025;), abnormal blood pressure (11. 1 &#x 0025;), medication (6. 9 &#x 0025;) and underweight donors (2. 9 &#x 0025;). Significantly more volunteers were deferred than relative donors (13. 97 &#x 0025; vs 5. 80 &#x 0025;; P < 0. 000). Females {{were found to have}} higher deferral rate than males (53. 5 &#x 0025; vs 6. 9 &#x 0025;; P= 0. 000) and higher odds ratio for deferral (15. 4). Donors older than 40 years of age had significantly higher chance of being deferred (P < 0. 05). Discussion and Conclusion: It is important to determine the rate and causes of WBD deferral to guide the recruitment and retention efforts at local, regional, and national level...|$|R
6000|$|... 138. I {{could not}} enter, {{in a popular}} lecture, upon one {{intricate}} and difficult question, closely connected with the subject of Pre-Raphaelitism--namely, the relation of invention to observation; and composition to imitation. It is still less a question to {{be discussed in the}} compass of a note; and I must <b>defer</b> all careful <b>examination</b> of it to a future opportunity. Nevertheless, it is impossible to leave altogether unanswered the first objection which is now most commonly made to the Pre-Raphaelite work, namely, that the principle of it seems adverse to all exertion of imaginative power. Indeed, such an objection sounds strangely on the lips of a public {{who have been in the}} habit of purchasing, for hundreds of pounds, small squares of Dutch canvas, containing only servile imitations of the coarsest nature. It is strange that an imitation of a cow's head by Paul Potter, or of an old woman's by Ostade, or of a scene of tavern debauchery by Teniers, should be purchased and proclaimed for high art, while the rendering of the most noble expressions of human feeling in Hunt's [...] "Isabella," [...] or of the loveliest English landscape, haunted by sorrow, in Millais' [...] "Ophelia," [...] should be declared [...] "puerile." [...] But, strange though the utterance of it be, there is some weight in the objection. It is true that so long as the Pre-Raphaelites only paint from nature, however carefully selected and grouped, their pictures can never have the characters of the highest class of compositions. But, on the other hand, the shallow and conventional arrangements commonly called [...] "compositions" [...] by the artists of the present day, are infinitely farther from great art than the most patient work of the Pre-Raphaelites. That work is, even in its humblest form, a secure foundation, capable of infinite superstructure; a reality of true value, as far as it reaches, while the common artistical effects and groupings are a vain effort at superstructure without foundation--utter negation and fallacy from beginning to end.|$|R
