5|$|George Preston Marshall, {{owner and}} founder of the franchise, sought to rename the Boston Braves after leaving the stadium they shared with the {{baseball}} team of the same name. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> name Redskins in honor of Dietz, who was Sioux.|$|E
5|$|Tippett {{resolved}} {{that his}} work would be an oratorio rather than an opera. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> title from Ein Kind unserer Zeit, a contemporary protest novel by the Austro-Hungarian writer, Ödön von Horváth.|$|E
5|$|Bishop Augustus Short {{moved from}} England to Adelaide after the Archbishop of Canterbury offered him {{the choice of}} moving to Newcastle—on the coast of New South Wales—or Adelaide, both {{recently}} established dioceses. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> latter, and was consecrated at Westminster Abbey on St Peter's Day, 29 June 1847. He arrived in Adelaide by ship on 28 December 1847.|$|E
50|$|The Hallé Orchestra of Manchester honored Carlebach {{year by year}} {{by giving}} a symphony concert for which <b>he</b> <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> program.|$|R

5000|$|The party suing (the applicant) is dominus litis; <b>he</b> <b>chooses</b> <b>the</b> {{procedure}} to be used. It must be appreciated {{that it is}} inherently unfair on the respondent {{to be brought to}} court in an application ...|$|R
5|$|Granderson was {{recruited}} {{by a number}} of college baseball programs, and <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), in part because they allowed him to play basketball in addition to baseball. However, Granderson quit basketball two weeks into his freshman year in order to concentrate on baseball.|$|E
5|$|In 1880 Nansen {{passed his}} {{university}} entrance examination, the examen artium. He decided to study zoology, claiming later that <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> subject {{because he thought}} it offered the chance of a life in the open air. He began his studies at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania early in 1881.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2017, it was {{announced}} that Rodríguez joined Italian Serie A club A.C. Milan on a four-year deal. The fee was reported as €15 million plus €2 million in bonuses. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> number 68 shirt, after the year his mother was born.|$|E
6000|$|Our hostess enters wreathed in smiles. Is {{she really}} {{pleased to see}} us, or is she saying to herself, [...] "Drat the man! Why must <b>he</b> <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> very morning I had {{intended}} to fix up the clean curtains?" ...|$|R
50|$|After {{his junior}} year of high school, Eric {{received}} interest {{from a number of}} Division 1 college basketball programs. <b>He</b> <b>choose</b> <b>The</b> College of the Holy Cross in October 2008 due to its storied basketball tradition and strong academic reputation.|$|R
50|$|During the English Civil War <b>he</b> <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> {{side of the}} Stuarts. In 1652 {{his wife}} died. He {{remarried}} Geertruid van Dueren who died in 1658. In those years he was living on Nieuwe Waalseiland, close to the harbour and selling wine in Stockholm.|$|R
5|$|Turner {{graduated}} from the University of Maryland in May 2009 with a bachelor's degree in government and politics. His strong interest in politics factored into his decision on where to attend college. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> University of Maryland partly based on its close proximity to Washington, D.C. Turner's political views are liberal; he is registered as a Democrat, and has described himself as an idealist.|$|E
5|$|During this time, William Thompson — {{best known}} as W.F. Thompson — began {{gathering}} investors to purchase the Fairbanks Daily News. After Corson's candidacy failed and Thompson amassed $15,000 from investors, he purchased the Daily News in March 1909. On March 18, 1909, the Daily News published its last issue. Four days later, it reopened under the name Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, an amalgam {{of the names of}} the Daily News and Thompson's previous operation, the Tanana Miner. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> name over his first idea, the Daily Alaska Miner.|$|E
5|$|Greinke {{agreed to}} a six-year free agent {{contract}} with the Los Angeles Dodgers worth $147 million, on December 8, 2012. The deal, which was finalized on December 10, was the largest ever for a right-handed pitcher {{at the time it}} was signed. It was surpassed a year later by Félix Hernández's seven-year $175 million contract extension with the Seattle Mariners. Greinke later claimed that <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> Dodgers over the Texas Rangers, who also were pursuing him, primarily because they offered more money.|$|E
50|$|Manohar (J. D. Chakravarthy) just {{finished}} his B.Com. Manohar comes {{to know that}} Venkata Narayana is none but his own maternal uncle. Then <b>he</b> <b>chooses</b> <b>the</b> easy way out to become a filth rich millionaire. That is to marry the daughter of Venkata Narayara, Madhavi.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> was <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> {{president}} of the Indian National Congress in 1890.|$|R
50|$|Theseus tells Ariadne {{about his}} {{departure}} from Athens with the Innocents. Ariadne believes that Theseus offers her {{a means of}} escape from Crete. She plays a game of chance with him using a stone: if <b>he</b> <b>chooses</b> <b>the</b> hand in which she holds the stone he will enter the labyrinth to confront the Minotaur, but if <b>he</b> <b>chooses</b> her empty hand he must remain a bystander to the bloodshed. Ariadne cheats so that Theseus <b>chooses</b> <b>the</b> empty hand.|$|R
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{established}} his district headquarters on the 18th floor of 270 Broadway in New York City. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> name Development of Substitute Materials (DSM), {{but this would}} not stick. Colonel Leslie R. Groves, Jr., {{the head of the}} Construction Branch in the Office of the Chief of Engineers thought it would attract undue attention. Instead, the new district was given the innocuous name of the Manhattan Engineer District, following the usual practice of naming engineer districts after the city in which their headquarters was located. The name of the project soon followed suit. It was formally established by the Chief of Engineers, Major General Eugene Reybold on August 16, 1942.|$|E
5|$|The {{title was}} {{released}} in place of an aborted attempt to port the 2006 game Sonic the Hedgehog to the Wii. Producer Yojiro Ogawa conceived Secret Rings {{to tap into the}} Wii Remote's capabilities. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> theme of Arabian Nights, using many elements of the stories in the game's setting, characters, and Middle Eastern-influenced music. Sega changed the title of the game several times, originally being announced as Sonic Wild Fire, before settling on Sonic and the Secret Rings to tie in the theme of Arabian Nights.|$|E
50|$|The {{old woman}} returns {{and is very}} impressed. She takes Hans to {{the room with the}} three veiled figures. The Sorcerer himself is there too. John is warned by her of <b>the</b> {{consequences}} if <b>he</b> <b>chooses</b> <b>the</b> wrong one and leaves him, giving him one hour to decide.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, <b>he</b> was <b>chosen</b> <b>the</b> Communication Entrepreneur of the Year by Revista IstoÉ.|$|R
50|$|After this, Khaleque {{has only}} one thing to do. To {{eliminate}} Nur or bear the consequences, as Moina Mia, Awami League MP and the person who has introduced the duo to Sheikh Mujib, thinks it is Khaleque who has convinced Nur to speak against <b>the</b> Prime Minister. <b>He</b> <b>chooses</b> <b>the</b> former.|$|R
5|$|The {{works of}} William Shakespeare enjoyed a renewed {{popularity}} in 18th-century Britain. Several new editions {{of his works}} were published, his plays were revived in the theatre and numerous works of art were created illustrating the plays and specific productions of them. Capitalising on this interest, Boydell decided to publish a grand illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays that would showcase the talents of British painters and engravers. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> noted scholar and Shakespeare editor George Steevens to oversee the edition, which was released between 1791 and 1803.|$|E
5|$|Arnold, whose {{business}} activities {{before the war}} had included sailing ships to Europe and the West Indies, carefully chose the site {{where he wanted to}} meet the British fleet. Reliable intelligence he received on October 1 indicated that the British had a force significantly more powerful than his. Because his force was inferior, <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> narrow, rocky body of water between the western shore of Lake Champlain and Valcour Island (near modern Plattsburgh, New York), where the British fleet would have difficulty bringing its superior firepower to bear, and where the inferior seamanship of his relatively unskilled sailors would have a minimal negative effect. Some of Arnold's captains wanted to fight in open waters where {{they might be able to}} retreat to the shelter of Fort Crown Point, but Arnold argued that the primary purpose of the fleet was not survival but the delay of a British advance on Crown Point and Ticonderoga until the following spring.|$|E
5|$|By March, Clarke's {{deception}} operations {{had grown}} {{and it was}} decided to create a formal department. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> name Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force - the 'A' being a subtle reference to airborne - in the hope that it would help support the existence of paratroopers in the area (as well as hide the true purpose of the department). Clarke continued actively promoting the existence of 1st SAS until around June 1941, and it appears that Axis commanders accepted the brigade as real. Clarke had created the unit with no specific aims, although it did mean that the enemy command had to factor the existence of airborne troops into any battle plan. However, Abeam and the 1st SAS represented his first attempt at inflating the apparent strength of Allied forces, a tactic he would use significantly over the rest of the war. The brigade occasionally featured in Clarke's tactical deceptions; such as a March 1941 threat to Axis supply lines near Tripoli.|$|E
5000|$|The novel The Accidental Pope by Raymond Flynn and Robin Moore (2000) has a widowed American {{fisherman}} {{with four}} children elected pope by a fluke. [...] <b>He</b> <b>chooses</b> <b>the</b> name Peter II {{in honor of}} Pope Peter I, who he describes as also having been a fisherman who had been married.|$|R
5000|$|Niutsuhime Jinja, {{situated}} in the Amano basin between Kongobu-ji and Jison-in. Closely connected to Koyasan, it enshrines Koya Myōjin who, legend tells, gave land to Kūkai when <b>he</b> <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> compound of Kongobu-ji, and Niu Myōjin, who guided him, {{and all of them}} are connected by the pilgrimage route Koyasan Choishimichi.|$|R

5|$|By the 1030s Malcolm's sons, {{if he had}} any, were dead. The only {{evidence}} that {{he did have a}} son or sons is in Rodulfus Glaber's chronicle where Cnut is said to have stood as godfather to a son of Malcolm. His grandson Thorfinn would have been unlikely to be accepted as king by the Scots, and <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> sons of his other daughter, Bethóc, who was married to Crínán, lay abbot of Dunkeld, and perhaps Mormaer of Atholl. It may be no more than coincidence, but in 1027 the Irish annals had reported the burning of Dunkeld, although no mention is made of the circumstances. Malcolm's chosen heir, and the first tánaise ríg certainly known in Scotland, was Duncan.|$|E
5|$|Chiranjeevi {{wanted his}} brother Nagendra Babu {{to work in}} films after graduating from college. To gain {{experience}} in film production, Babu worked at the Geetha Arts company. He started a company named Anjana Productions after his mother K. Anjana Devi. He planned to make an unconventional film without considering Chiranjeevi's on-screen image as an action hero. After watching Sankarabharanam (1980) and Sindhu Bhairavi (1985), Babu approached Chiranjeevi's mentor K. Balachander to direct his maiden production venture. They worked together on Idi Katha Kaadu (1979) and 47 Rojulu (1981); he played the antagonist in both films. Balachander agreed to direct the film; <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> concept of national integration and rural development after watching Anna Hazare developing Ralegan Siddhi, a village in Maharashtra. He was also inspired by a retired Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer's act of adopting his village in West Godavari district.|$|E
5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} from the Admiralty required a detailed geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, particularly whether they rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and the effects of tides measured with specially constructed gauges. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival on 1 April the entire crew set to work. Darwin found a coconut economy, serving both the small settlement and wildlife. There was a limited range of native plants and no land birds, but hermit crabs everywhere. The lagoons teemed with a rich variety of invertebrates and fish, and he examined the atoll's structure in view of the theory he had developed in Lima, of encircling reefs becoming atolls as an island sank. This idea was supported by the numerous soundings FitzRoy had taken showing a steep slope outside the reef with no living corals below 20–30 fathoms (10–15m).|$|E

[...] "Then he can make peace if <b>he</b> <b>chooses.</b> <b>The</b> white men will not wish to go on fighting. The Fantis are eager for peace and to return to their villages. What do you think?" ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{signaling}} value of a tax when agents are less informed {{on the effect of}} their consumption than <b>the</b> policy-maker. When <b>he</b> <b>chooses</b> <b>the</b> tax, the policy-maker optimizes both the incentive effect and the effect on beliefs. We show that optimal taxes under symmetric information are not implementable under asymmetric information. The tax distortion required for credibility depends on the marginal cost of public funds and brings to undertaxation...|$|R

After fondling both sisters with his eyes closed, <b>he</b> <b>chooses</b> <b>the</b> elder. She is uncomfortable during their sex and {{afterwards}} recites threatening dialogue from the Hollywood film to her brother.|$|R
