5|$|Despite its {{chemical}} similarity, lithium typically {{does not}} occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size. Due to its relatively low reactivity, {{it can be found}} in seawater <b>in</b> <b>large</b> amounts; it is estimated that seawater is approximately 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm) or 25 micromolar. Its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals, where its crustal concentration is about 18ppm, comparable to that of gallium and niobium. Commercially, the most important lithium mineral is spodumene, which occurs <b>in</b> <b>large</b> deposits worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In {{many areas}} it is {{regarded}} as an agricultural pest, feeding <b>in</b> <b>large</b> flocks on cultivated cereals such as rice. In Southeast Asia, the scaly-breasted munia is trapped <b>in</b> <b>large</b> numbers for Buddhist ceremonies, but most birds are later released.|$|E

30|$|The {{location}} also positively moderates {{the relation}} between EO and venture performance. Firms located <b>in</b> the <b>larger</b> city are more innovative, proactive, competitive and autonomous than firms established in regional towns. These are because of high competition <b>in</b> the <b>large</b> city, which encourage firms to innovate {{a new way of}} doing things and technology that helps to produce new products, and to search for new markets. A risk is associated with activities that have good promise to return. As a result, firms <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> cities are more autonomous and risk takers. In general, firms involved with the manufacturing sector and adopting strong EO tend to perform more than their relatives. Besides, firms located <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> cities that adopt EO grow much better than enterprises established in regional towns. More specifically, the performance of ventures <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> cities is better than the ventures in regional towns because of the better practice of EO <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> cities.|$|R

Belugas, being white, hunt <b>in</b> <b>large</b> pods near the surface and around pack ice, their {{coloration}} acting as camouflage. Narwhals, being black, hunt <b>in</b> <b>large</b> pods in the aphotic zone, but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged when something is looking directly up or down at them. They have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with pack ice.|$|E

5|$|The {{difficulty}} in purifying proteins <b>in</b> <b>large</b> quantities made them {{very difficult for}} early protein biochemists to study. Hence, early studies focused on proteins that could be purified <b>in</b> <b>large</b> quantities, e.g., those of blood, egg white, various toxins, and digestive/metabolic enzymes obtained from slaughterhouses. In the 1950s, the Armour Hot Dog Co. purified 1 kg of pure bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A and made it freely available to scientists; this gesture helped ribonuclease A become a major target for biochemical study for the following decades.|$|E

5|$|Although it is toxic <b>in</b> <b>large</b> doses, {{selenium}} is {{an essential}} micronutrient for animals.
