25|$|Natural {{electrostatic}} phenomena {{are most}} familiar as an occasional annoyance in seasons of low humidity, {{but can be}} destructive and harmful in some situations (e.g. electronics manufacturing). When working {{in direct contact with}} integrated circuit electronics (especially delicate MOSFETs), or in the presence of <b>flammable</b> <b>gas,</b> care must be taken to avoid accumulating and suddenly discharging a static charge (see electrostatic discharge).|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen sulfide is {{a highly}} toxic and <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> (flammable range: 4.3–46%). Being heavier than air, it tends to {{accumulate}} {{at the bottom of}} poorly ventilated spaces. Although very pungent at first, it quickly deadens the sense of smell, so victims may be unaware of its presence until it is too late. For safe handling procedures, a hydrogen sulfide safety data sheet (SDS) should be consulted.|$|E
25|$|Before {{gunpowder}} {{was applied}} to civil engineering, there were two ways to break up large rocks, by hard labor or by heating with large fires followed by rapid quenching. The earliest record {{for the use of}} gunpowder in mines comes from Hungary in 1627. It was introduced to Britain in 1638 by German miners, after which records are numerous. Until the invention of the safety fuse by William Bickford in 1831, the practice was extremely dangerous. Another reason for danger were the dense fumes given off and the risk of igniting <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> when used in coal mines.|$|E

25|$|Phosphine (PH3) and its organic {{derivatives}} (PR3) are structural analogues with ammonia (NH3) but {{the bond}} angles at phosphorus {{are closer to}} 90° for phosphine and its organic derivatives. It is an ill-smelling, toxic compound. Phosphorus has an oxidation number of -3 in phosphine. Phosphine is produced by hydrolysis of calcium phosphide, Ca3P2. Unlike ammonia, phosphine is oxidised by air. Phosphine is also far less basic than ammonia. Other phophines are known which contain chains of up to nine phosphorus atoms and have the formula PnHn+2. The highly <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> diphosphine (P2H4) is an analogue of hydrazine.|$|E
25|$|The {{feeling of}} an {{electric}} shock {{is caused by the}} stimulation of nerves as the neutralizing current flows through the human body. The energy stored as static electricity on an object varies {{depending on the size of}} the object and its capacitance, the voltage to which it is charged, and the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium. For modelling the effect of static discharge on sensitive electronic devices, a human being is represented as a capacitor of 100 picofarads, charged to a voltage of 4000 to 35000 volts. When touching an object this energy is discharged in less than a microsecond. While the total energy is small, on the order of millijoules, it can still damage sensitive electronic devices. Larger objects will store more energy, which may be directly hazardous to human contact or which may give a spark that can ignite <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> or dust.|$|E
25|$|A lower {{threshold}} of mens rea is satisfied when a defendant recognizes an act is dangerous but decides to commit it anyway. This is recklessness. It is the mental {{state of mind}} of the person {{at the time the}} actus reus was committed. For instance, if C tears a gas meter from a wall to get the money inside, and knows this will let <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> escape into a neighbour's house, he could be liable for poisoning. Courts often consider whether the actor did recognize the danger, or alternatively ought to have recognized a risk. Of course, a requirement only that one ought to have recognized a danger (though he did not) is tantamount to erasing intent as a requirement. In this way, the importance of mens rea has been reduced in some areas of the criminal law but is obviously still an important part in the criminal system.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen's low {{viscosity}} and high thermal conductivity {{make it the}} most powerful working gas, primarily because the engine can run faster than with other gases. However, because of hydrogen absorption, and given the high diffusion rate associated with this low molecular weight gas, particularly at high temperatures, H2 leaks through the solid metal of the heater. Diffusion through carbon steel is too high to be practical, but may be acceptably low for metals such as aluminum, or even stainless steel. Certain ceramics also greatly reduce diffusion. Hermetic pressure vessel seals are necessary to maintain pressure inside the engine without replacement of lost gas. For high temperature differential (HTD) engines, auxiliary systems {{may need to be}} added to maintain high pressure working fluid. These systems can be a gas storage bottle or a gas generator. Hydrogen can be generated by electrolysis of water, the action of steam on red hot carbon-based fuel, by gasification of hydrocarbon fuel, or by the reaction of acid on metal. Hydrogen can also cause the embrittlement of metals. Hydrogen is a <b>flammable</b> <b>gas,</b> which is a safety concern if released from the engine.|$|E
