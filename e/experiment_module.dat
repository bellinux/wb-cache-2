5|$|The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is Japan's space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and {{aviation}} research, {{and leads}} development of rockets and satellites. It is {{a participant in}} the International Space Station: the Japanese <b>Experiment</b> <b>Module</b> (Kibo) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008. The space probe Akatsuki was launched May 20, 2010, and achieved orbit around Venus on December 9, 2015. Japan's plans in space exploration include: developing the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter to be launched in 2016; and building a moon base by 2030.|$|E
25|$|The lead {{electrical}} engineer for the Space <b>Experiment</b> <b>Module</b> {{program at the}} Wallops Flight Facility located in Virginia, {{which is part of}} NASA's Goddard Flight Facility, is Lissette Martínez is an Electrical Engineer and Rocket Scientist. She is responsible for providing {{electrical engineer}}ing support to Code 870 Space <b>Experiment</b> <b>Module</b> (SEM) program. She is also responsible for the testing of ground and flight hardware. Martinez works with students around the world, helping them with science experiments that will actually ride along on Space Shuttle missions and blast into space. Martinez {{was a member of the}} team that launched a rocket from White Sands, New Mexico to gather information on the Hale-Bopp Comet in 1999. She was featured in the November 2002 issue of Latina magazine.|$|E
25|$|Before the merger, ISAS was {{responsible}} for space and planetary research, while NAL was focused on aviation research. NASDA, which was founded on 1 October 1969, had developed rockets, satellites, and also built the Japanese <b>Experiment</b> <b>Module.</b> The old NASDA headquarters were located at the current site of the Tanegashima Space Center, on Tanegashima Island, 115 kilometers south of Kyūshū. NASDA also trained Japanese astronauts, who flew with the US Space Shuttles.|$|E
50|$|Typically the {{facilities}} for physical sciences and biology offer accommodation of custom made <b>experiment</b> <b>modules,</b> {{dependent on the}} scientific objectives. For physiology a suite of instruments are accommodated.|$|R

25|$|STS-124 {{delivered}} the Pressurized Module (PM) of the Japanese <b>Experiment</b> <b>Module</b> (JEM), called Kibō, to the International Space Station (ISS). Kibō was berthed to the Harmony module and the pressurized {{section of the}} JEM Experiment Logistics Module, brought up by the STS-123 crew, was moved from Harmony to the JEM-PM. The Japanese Remote Manipulator System, a robotic arm, was also delivered by STS-124 and attached to Kibō. The entire Kibō laboratory is being brought up over three missions.|$|E
25|$|Endeavour {{carried a}} wide variety of {{equipment}} and cargo in the payload bay, with the largest item being the Kibo Japanese <b>Experiment</b> <b>Module</b> Exposed Facility (JEM EF), and the Kibo Japanese Experiment Logistics Module – Exposed Section (ELM-ES). The exposed facility is a part of Kibo that will allow astronauts to perform science experiments that are exposed to the vacuum of space. The exposed section is similar to the logistics module on the Kibo laboratory, but is not pressurized. Once its payloads were transferred to the JEM EF, the ELM-ES was returned to the payload bay.|$|E
25|$|EVA 1 {{started with}} astronauts Dave Wolf and Tim Kopra {{switching}} their spacesuit power to internal battery at 16:19 UTC. Despite a communication {{problem with the}} spacewalkers, the Japanese Exposed Facility was successfully installed on the Japanese <b>Experiment</b> <b>Module</b> {{by means of a}} complex series of steps involving the robotic arms of both the station and the shuttle. The JEF was first unberthed from the shuttle payload bay by the station arm, after which the shuttle arm took the load. The station arm was then moved to the worksite on Node-2 (Harmony), wherefrom it took the 4.1 ton facility back. The facility was then successfully latched on to the <b>Experiment</b> <b>Module.</b> As part of the EVA, the spacewalkers successfully deployed the port Unpressurized Cargo Carrier Attach System (UCCAS), which could not be deployed during STS-119. During the prior mission, the deployment failed due to a jamming caused by a stuck detent pin. Engineers designed a custom tool to force the pin to release, which was used to deploy the mechanism. Meanwhile, the shuttle managers announced {{that there would be no}} need for a focused inspection of the heat shield. The nose cap and wing leading-edge panels of the shuttle were cleared for entry as they were, but a reentry clearance was not given. Beyond one impact site having a gouge, the rest of the impacts were found to be mostly a loss of coating. The other activity scheduled for EVA 1, the deployment of a starboard side cargo carrier, was postponed for want of time. A fuel cell issue found before launch was analyzed, though the cell continued to function as expected with no impact to the mission.|$|E
40|$|Sounding rockets {{can serve}} as a time- and {{cost-effective}} platform {{for a wide range of}} research under microgravity conditions. It is shown that MAPHEUS – MaterialPhysikalische Experimente Unter Schwerelosigkeit (Materials Physics Experiments under Weightlesness) – a DLR internal R&D project perfectly achieves this whilst maximizing scientific output. MAPHEUS hereby offers launch opportunities on a yearly basis and with comparatively short development cycles of about one year only. In the first three campaigns MAPHEUS provided about three minutes of microgravity time. Recent developments enable to extend this to four minutes above 100 km. Performance data of the recent MAPHEUS- 3 flight together with information on the <b>experiment</b> <b>modules</b> are provided.

25|$|Early on the day, Commander Ferguson and Pilot Hurley {{also spent}} some time working to {{successfully}} repair the door that gives the crew access to the LiOH canisters. Mission Specialist Magnus spent {{about an hour and}} a half in the morning taking microbial air samples on various locations in the space station. The collected samples will be returned for study and further analysis. Magnus also worked the Japanese <b>Experiment</b> <b>Module</b> Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS). Mission Specialist Walheim along with station crew member Mike Fossum continued work with spacewalking equipment in the Quest airlock. Some of them will be left on the station, and will be utilized during an upcoming Russian spacewalks on 3 August 2011. Hurley working with station crew member Ron Garan stored some of the cargo in Atlantis's middeck to be returned. Since no astronaut was riding in the mid-deck, on the way back, it was expected to be fully packed with 1564 pounds of cargo. Among cargo brought to the space station, 2281 pounds were also in the mid-deck.|$|E
