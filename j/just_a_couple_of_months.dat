5|$|Executives at Tetragrammaton Records, Deep Purple's American label, {{thought that}} it would have been more {{profitable}} to have a new album to promote during the US tour, besides the already successful Shades of Deep Purple. Moreover, the eight tracks recorded in May for Deep Purple's debut album and performed live in the British gigs of July and August were deemed insufficient for their shows as headliners in the US. For these reasons, they were pushed back into the studio <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> before the tour began, even though their debut album had not been released in the United Kingdom yet.|$|E

Two years later, Olsson left the band and was replaced by John Levén. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> later, Levén joined Yngwie Malmsteen's band Rising Force, and Malmsteen's former bassist, Marcel Jacob, joined Force. This only lasted for three months, though; Levén apparently had issues with Malmsteen, so he and Jacob traded places again.|$|E

Gallagher made headlines after an incident of road rage. He allegedly leaned out of his car window, grabbed a cyclist and threw him off his bike. The cyclist was not injured and Gallagher was given a caution. On 26 March 1998, Lisa Moorish bore Gallagher a daughter, Molly, who was conceived during an affair in Los Angeles in June 1997, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> after he and Kensit got married.

500|$|Palmer's {{goal for}} Fantastic Adventures {{was to create}} a {{magazine}} that published fantasy fiction but was the literary equal of the quality magazinesthe [...] "slicks", such as The Saturday Evening Post. Although mixing science fiction with fantasy was not popular with sf fans of the era, Palmer consciously promoted the magazine as containing the best of both worlds; the slogan on the cover read [...] "The Best in Science Fiction", but Palmer also wrote blurbs in Amazing Stories for Fantastic Adventures in which he extolled the value to a reader of getting both genres in a single magazine. Fantastic Adventures competition included Unknown, which had been launched <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> earlier, in March 1939, and Weird Tales, which was first published in 1923; but instead of attempting to emulate either one, Fantastic Adventures focused on adventure stories in the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Palmer probably acquired some fantasy-oriented material that had been submitted to Amazing Stories, which gave him an immediate stream of submissions to work with. However, according to Ashley the first issue was quite weak: The cover story was [...] "The Invisible Robinhood" [...] by Eando Binder, and other contributors included Harl Vincent, Ross Rocklynne and A. Hyatt Verrill. Features included a quiz, an author profile, and a comic strip, titled [...] "Ray Holmes, Scientific Detective"; the reader was supposed to solve the mystery based on the clues given in the strip. It was a failure and disappeared after the first issue. The back cover, [...] "The Man from Mars", by Frank R. Paul, was more successful, and illustrated back covers became a regular feature of the magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Following Reese and Bianca's arrival to {{the series}} as a couple in October 2008, the writers started {{building}} a Zach and Reese friendship. To viewers, the friendship soon became somewhat sexual in nature in what they described as Reese [...] "giving off a sexual vibe" [...] whenever around Zach. This perception was intensified once Reese was revealed by the series to have been engaged to a man <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> before becoming romantically involved with Bianca. Viewers who speculated Reese as bisexual suggested that she may be after Zach. The writers played this angle with ambiguity; they added in hug and kiss [...] "teasers" [...] such as Zach giving Reese a lingering peck on the cheek/neck.|$|E
2500|$|The {{term of the}} {{tribunal}} was initially set to expire in August 2005. [...] However, {{in the light of}} the many arguments the court was yet to hear, {{the tribunal}} filed a request for extension of its term. [...] The extension was granted and the tribunal's term was extended for another year until September 2006. [...] Early in 2006, a major controversy erupted over the 'Assessor's report' that was apparently 'leaked' to the press. [...] The report had suggested a decision which Karnataka summarily rejected. [...] Another major controversy erupted when <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> before the September 2006 deadline, the tribunal recommended the formation of another expert committee to study the 'ground realities' yet again. [...] This was unanimously and vehemently opposed by all the four states party to the dispute. [...] The states contended that this move would further delay a judgement which has already been 16 years in the making.|$|E

When in office, ElBaradei launched a program to establish [...] "integrated safeguards" [...] combining the IAEA’s comprehensive safeguard agreements with the newly adopted Additional Protocol. In his statement to the General Conference in 1998, he called upon all states to conclude the Additional Protocol: [...] "One of the main purposes of the strengthened-safeguards system can be better achieved with global adherence. I would, therefore, urge all states with outstanding-safeguards agreements to conclude them, and I would also urge all states to accelerate their consideration of the Model Additional Protocol and enter into consultations with the Agency at the earliest possible opportunity. We should work together to ensure that, by the year 2000, all states [...] have concluded outstanding-safeguards agreements and also the Additional Protocol." [...] ElBaradei repeated this call through his years as the Director General of the IAEA. In November 2009, 93 countries had Additional Protocols in force.|$|E
