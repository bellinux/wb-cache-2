5|$|The egg is {{generally}} oblong, slightly curved and tapering at one end. In {{the case of}} solitary bees, each one is laid in a cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it. This may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning. In social species of bee there is progressive provisioning with the larva being fed regularly while it grows. The nest varies from a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> or in wood, in solitary bees, to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} a nocturnal forest-dweller that reproduces once in late March–May {{and once in}} September–December, having one or two young each time. During the day, the mother digs a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> for her young to hide in. At night, she opens the {{entrance}} to the hole, while watching for predators (such as venomous snakes), and then nurses her young, after which she closes the hole with soil and plant material by thumping on it with her front paws. Amami rabbits sleep during the day in hidden locations, such as caves. They are also noted for having a call similar to that of a pika.|$|E
5|$|The cunning Fox is {{commonly}} found in Native American mythology, where it is portrayed as an almost constant companion to Coyote. Fox, however, is a deceitful companion that often steals Coyote's food. In the Achomawi creation myth, Fox and Coyote are the co-creators of the world, that leave just {{before the arrival of}} humans. The Yurok tribe believed that Fox, in anger, captured the sun, and tied him to a hill, causing him to burn a great <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> An Inuit story tells of how Fox, portrayed as a beautiful woman, tricks a hunter into marrying her, only to resume her true form and leave after he offends her. A Menominee story tells of how Fox is an untrustworthy friend to the Wolf.|$|E

5|$|The usual grave for a thrall was {{probably}} {{not much more than}} a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> He {{was probably}} buried in such a way as to ensure both that he did not return to haunt his masters and that he could be of use to his masters after they died. Slaves were sometimes sacrificed to be useful in the next life. A free man was usually given weapons and equipment for riding. An artisan, such as a blacksmith, could receive his entire set of tools. Women were provided with their jewelry and often with tools for female and household activities. The most sumptuous Viking funeral discovered so far is the Oseberg Ship burial, which was for a woman (probably a queen or a priestess) who lived in the 9th century.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the battle}} was shot at Ústí nad Labem in the Czech Republic. Only the {{entrance}} to Aslan's How was built on location. Adamson wanted Peter and Miraz's duel to feel unique and not like a controlled, overly choreographed fencing match: Moseley and Castellitto began training for the scene in November 2006. The stunt coordinator Allan Poppleton doubled for Castellitto in some shots because they are similar in size. For claustrophobic shots, cameras were built into their shields. The main camera was placed on a 360 degree track surrounding the ruin it takes place on. The filmmakers dug a large <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> for the scene where the Narnians cause the pillars supporting the growth near Aslan's How to collapse on the Telmarines. The earth was then restored following completion of the scene. They also had to restore the grass after filming numerous cavalry charges. 18,000 fern plants were imported to the Czech Republic to create a forest. A scene shot in Poland, which involved building a cliff face, also had to leave no trace behind. Filming finished by September 8, 2007.|$|E

25|$|Slugs are hermaphrodites, having both {{female and}} male {{reproductive}} organs. Once a slug has located a mate, they encircle each other and sperm is exchanged through their protruded genitalia.

25|$|The tunnel {{has created}} {{problems}} of its own. The toads originally refused {{to use the}} tunnel and so the tunnel was lit to encourage its use. The toads then died from {{the heat of the}} lamps inside the tunnel. Once through the tunnel, the toads also had to contend with birds who grew wise to the toad-producing <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The exit to the toad tunnel has been decorated by the Postmaster to resemble a toad town.|$|E
25|$|Orr's {{fears of}} a chalk fall, however, were not unfounded. Over the years, {{there have been many}} roof falls, most small. But in December 1999 a fall near Strood derailed a train, {{fortunately}} without causing serious injuries (but leaving a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in an orchard). Some 60% of the tunnel had by this date been lined: in 2004 it was closed to line the remainder and renew the track, reopening a year later on 17 January 2005.|$|E

25|$|Cost over-runs and differing tastes {{made the}} centre {{politically}} controversial, the design often being {{described as a}} large <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> both literally and figuratively. Despite this and a NZ$204 million price tag, it has won numerous design awards and is internationally recognised for its innovative but heritage-sympathetic architecture. The main source of contention was the relatively great expense of this public transport development in the Auckland Region, where for many decades the focus had been on private vehicle ownership and travel.|$|E
25|$|Traditional barbacoa {{involves}} {{digging a}} <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and placing some meat—usually a whole lamb—above a pot so the juices {{can be used}} to make a broth. It is then covered with maguey leaves and coal, and set alight. The cooking process takes a few hours. Olaudah Equiano, an African abolitionist, described this method of roasting alligators among the Mosquito People (Miskito people) on his journeys to Cabo Gracias a Dios in his narrative The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano.|$|E

25|$|A {{pit latrine}} or pit toilet {{is a type}} of toilet that {{collects}} human feces in a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> They use either no water or one to three liters per flush with pour-flush pit latrines. When properly built and maintained they can decrease the spread of disease by reducing the amount of human feces in the environment from open defecation. This decreases the transfer of pathogens between feces and food by flies. These pathogens are major causes of infectious diarrhea and intestinal worm infections. Infectious diarrhea resulted in about 700,000 deaths in children under five years old in 2011 and 250 million lost school days. Pit latrines are the lowest cost method of separating feces from people.|$|E
25|$|The grave goods {{had to be}} {{subjected}} to the same treatment as the body, if it were to accompany the dead person to the afterlife. If a person was immolated, then the grave goods had to be burnt as well, and if the deceased was to be interred, the objects were interred together with him. The usual grave for a thrall was probably {{not much more than a}} <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> He was probably buried in such a way as to ensure both that he did not return to haunt his masters and that he could be of use to his masters after they died.

Women were provided with their jewelry and often with tools for female and household activities. The most sumptuous Viking funeral discovered so far is the Oseberg ship burial, which was for a woman, obviously of elevated social status, who lived in the 9th century.|$|E
25|$|A {{pit latrine}} {{generally}} {{consists of three}} major parts: a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> a slab or floor with a small hole, and a shelter. The shelter is often known as an outhouse. The pit is typically at least 3meters (10feet) deep and 1m (3.2 feet) across. The World Health Organization recommends they be built a reasonable distance from the house balancing issues of easy access versus that of smell. The distance from groundwater and surface water should be as large as possible to decrease the risk of groundwater pollution. The hole in the slab should not be larger than 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) to prevent children falling in. Light should be prevented from entering the pit to reduce access by flies. This may {{require the use of}} a lid to cover the hole in the floor when not in use. When the pit fills to within 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) of the top, it should be either emptied or a new pit constructed and the shelter moved or re-built at the new location. Fecal sludge management involves emptying pits as well as transporting, treating and using the collected fecal sludge. If this is not carried out properly, water pollution and public health risks can occur.|$|E
