500|$|Upon its release, [...] "City Girl" [...] {{received}} moderate critical acclaim. Pitchfork Media writer Mark Richardson {{said that}} [...] "on first listen {{it sounds like}} a demo of a pre-Loveless track, possibly from the You Made Me Realise era" [...] and while there was [...] "no exploration on that front … the melody and voice are familiar and welcome." [...] Writing for Stylus Magazine, Andrew Unterberger called [...] "City Girl" [...] "a worthy opener" [...] and added that [...] " [...] where Kevin's at right now—making pretty pop songs. There <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> to this song that it's almost enough to make you think Kevin's lost his mind." [...] Unterberger summarised the song as [...] "gorgeous, and definitely has that sighing quality to it that makes the film so delectable." [...] Exclaim! journalist Michael White noted that it was [...] "the indisputable highlight of the soundtrack" [...] and AllMusics Heather Phares described [...] "City Girl" [...] as an [...] "open-ended piece" [...] and [...] "naïve [...] guitar-driven" [...] but added that it did not compare to Shields' compositions on Loveless (1991).|$|E
500|$|According to the {{protocol}} provided by Navy Secretary George M. Robeson, {{command of the}} expedition {{was turned over to}} Budington, under whom discipline further devolved. The precious coal was being burned at a high rate: [...] in November, which was [...] more than the previous month, and close to [...] in December. Budington was often seen to be drunk, but he was far from the only one to pilfer the alcohol stores; according to testimony at the Inquiry, Tyson was also seen [...] "drunk like old mischief", and Schumann had {{gone so far as to}} make a duplicate of Budington's key so that he could help himself to alcohol as well. Whatever the role of alcohol, it was clear that shipboard routine was breaking down; as Tyson remarked, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> regularity observed. There is no stated time for putting out lights; the men are allowed to do as they please; and, consequently, they often make nights hideous by their carousing, playing cards to all hours." [...] For purposes unknown, Budington chose to issue the ship's supply of firearms to the crew.|$|E

There <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> thought given to eternal issues that their very absence make them pointedly there. These people are so locked into the world, by default some sort of transcendence is located elsewhere, and obviously machines become the totem they imbue with sacred properties, wishes, hopes, goals, desires, dreams. That sounds like 1940s SF, but it's become the world." ...|$|E

He is concerned only with general infection from corpses without respect to the disease that led to death. In this respect his opinion seems improbable.|$|E

2500|$|Because there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> room at {{the home}} where they live, Bramble Bellflower (...) decides {{that he and his}} family should move. He does not {{announce}} the plan until later, when the seven members come {{over to the other side}} of the hill and look at their new property. They do not know that Bramble has actually bought and remodelled the house, which is called The Berries. It will be eight days before the family settles in their new spot. But Periwinkle, one of Bramble's five children, is deeply affected by the change of address; he is afraid he will miss his neighbour, Pimpernelle, and his old home, in the process. He finds his new room, which he will share with brother Dandelion, too large for his liking.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{recently}} discovered dark energy and its implication on the cosmological constant, Leonard Susskind says [...] "The great mystery is not {{why there is}} dark energy. The great mystery is why there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> of it ... The {{fact that we are}} just on the knife edge of existence, [...] if dark energy were very much bigger we wouldn’t be here, that's the mystery." [...] A slightly larger quantity of dark energy, or a slightly larger value of the cosmological constant would have caused space to expand rapidly enough that galaxies would not form. Despite this, Susskind does not necessarily see the universe as being fine-tuned, suggesting that some parts of the [...] "megaverse" [...] in which we live might just, by chance, be suitable for the emergence of life, while other parts might not be.|$|E
2500|$|... {{the miners}} must {{sometimes}} work {{in places where}} there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> circulation of air, that their candles can scarcely burn; and I have almost invariably observed, that a continuance for any considerable length of time, (although in such situations they may only work {{three or four hours}} daily), brings on pneumonia in the young and plethoric, and hydrothorax in the old, if rather of spare habit of body; and if there should happen to be any healthy middle-aged men working as hand-neighbours to these others, although of course both must breath the same impure air, these middle-aged men will remain free from any urgent complaint, till both their young and their aged neighbours are laid aside, perhaps never more to return. I became so fully convinced of this fact, as long ago to have induced me to recommend to the agents and overseers of this place, to avoid, as much as possible, putting thither very young or very old men into such situations.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{than what}} is learned of his {{character}} from the novels themselves, very {{little is known about}} Perry Mason. [...] His family, personal life, background, and education are not depicted, although according to the first chapter of The Case of the Sleepwalker's Niece (1935), his astrological sign was Leo. Mason has a professional relationship with Paul Drake, although after The Case of the Velvet Claws fees are seldom discussed. Della Street is Mason's only (unacknowledged) romantic interest. It is known that he lives in an apartment because he is occasionally awakened from sleep to go to his office; he does not entertain anyone at home. His tastes in food are known because many scenes take place in restaurants, and that he is an excellent driver is shown by his participation in the occasional car chase. Other than those sketchy facts, there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> physical description of him that the reader is not even sure what he looks like.|$|E
2500|$|If the Earth's crust was {{expanding}} {{along the}} oceanic ridges, Hess and Dietz reasoned like Holmes and others before them, {{it must be}} shrinking elsewhere. Hess followed Heezen, suggesting that new oceanic crust continuously spreads away from the ridges in a conveyor belt–like motion. And, using the mobilistic concepts developed before, he correctly concluded that many millions of years later, the oceanic crust eventually descends along the continental margins where oceanic trenches – very deep, narrow canyons – are formed, e.g. along {{the rim of the}} Pacific Ocean basin. The important step Hess made was that convection currents would be the driving force in this process, arriving at the same conclusions as Holmes had decades before with the only difference that the thinning of the ocean crust was performed using Heezen's mechanism of spreading along the ridges. Hess therefore concluded that the Atlantic Ocean was expanding while the Pacific Ocean was shrinking. As old oceanic crust is [...] "consumed" [...] in the trenches (like Holmes and others, he thought this was done by thickening of the continental lithosphere, not, as now understood, by underthrusting at a larger scale of the oceanic crust itself into the mantle), new magma rises and erupts along the spreading ridges to form new crust. In effect, the ocean basins are perpetually being [...] "recycled," [...] with the creation of new crust and the destruction of old oceanic lithosphere occurring simultaneously. Thus, the new mobilistic concepts neatly explained why the Earth does not get bigger with sea floor spreading, why there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> sediment accumulation on the ocean floor, and why oceanic rocks are much younger than continental rocks.|$|E
