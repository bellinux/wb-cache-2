Using this interface the user can start, stop or change the state of the DAQ system, can have the most important information about the whole system states and can activate others service programs in order to select parameters, databases and to display additional information about the evolution of the system. In this version the user interface is a Motif-based program developed using XDesigner and integrates many components of the RD 13 DAQ system. The interface has WWW based on line help. 2. 0 Requirements The basic requirements of the user interface are as follows:. Provide a <b>global</b> <b>experiment</b> panel from which the user can activate and navigate in all the command and display panels;. Give the user in the <b>global</b> <b>experiment</b> panel the minimum summarized information about experiment parameters and status;. Give the user the possibil...|$|E

40|$|AbstractReal-life data {{usually are}} {{presented}} in databases by real numbers. On the other hand, most inductive learning methods require {{a small number of}} attribute values. Thus it is necessary to convert input data sets with continuous attributes into input data sets with discrete attributes.

In this paper, a method of transforming any local discretization method into a global one is presented. A global discretization method, based on cluster analysis, is presented and compared experimentally with three known local methods, transformed into <b>global.</b> <b>Experiments</b> include tenfold cross-validation and leaving-one-out methods for ten real-life data sets...|$|R
