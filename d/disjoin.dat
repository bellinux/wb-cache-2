40|$|This paper {{covers the}} method of direct {{measurement}} of the <b>disjoining</b> pressure isotherm for sing, isolated foam films stabilized with TTAB above cmc by microinterferometric technique. It has been studied that the relation of <b>disjoining</b> pressure and film thickness, {{and the difference between}} the surface tension of solution and that of the common black film under different liquid film thickness conditions. The experimental results show that common black film thickness depends on the <b>disjoining</b> pressure and electrolytic concentration. At a low <b>disjoining</b> pressure, the film thickness decreases with the increase of the <b>disjoining</b> pressure. At a high <b>disjoining</b> pressure, the film thickness decreases slightly with the increase of the <b>disjoining</b> pressure. This signifies that the transition between black films is jumping. The electrolyte can reduce the interaction forces between two charged monolayers of film and thin the film, so the equilibrium thickness of film decreases with increasing electrolyte concentration of the solution from which they are formed. The surface tension of common black film calculated from the <b>disjoining</b> pressure isotherm is slightly different from the surface tension of solution...|$|R
40|$|Pore-scale coupled flow {{of gas and}} {{condensate}} {{is believed}} to be the main mechanism for condensate production in low interfacial tension, IFT, gas condensate reservoirs. While coupling enhances condensate flow due to transport of condensate lenses by the gas, it dramatically reduces gas permeability by introducing capillary resistance against gas flow. In this study, a dynamic wetting approach is used to investigate the effect of viscous resistance, IFT and <b>disjoining</b> pressure on pore-scale coupling of gas and condensate. <b>Disjoining</b> pressure arises from van der Waals interactions between gas and solid through thin liquid films, e. g., condensate films on pore walls. Low values of IFT and small pore diameters, as involved in many gas condensate reservoirs, give rise to importance of <b>disjoining</b> pressure. Calculations show that <b>disjoining</b> pressure postpones gas condensate coupling to higher condensate flow fractions-from about,., for vanishing <b>disjoining</b> effect to more than,., for strong <b>disjoining</b> effect.

Yet further, strange and incredible as you may think it, know, Sir Knight--for to your honour I can commit even that almost incredible secret--know that Saladin will put a sacred seal on this happy union betwixt the bravest and noblest of Frangistan and Asia, by raising to the rank of his royal spouse a Christian damsel, allied in blood to King Richard, and known by the name of the Lady Edith of Plantagenet."

6000|$|Alas! {{to those}} who know the ecclesiastical history of the race—the most perverse and melancholy in man’s annals—this will seem only a figure of much that is typical of Scotland and her high-seated capital above the Forth—a figure so grimly {{realistic}} that it may pass with strangers for a caricature. We are wonderful patient haters for conscience sake {{up here in the}} North. I spoke, in the first of these papers, of the Parliaments of the Established and Free Churches, and how they can hear each other singing psalms across the street. There is but a street between them in space, but a shadow between them in principle; and yet there they sit, enchanted, and in damnatory accents pray for each other’s growth in grace. It would be well if there were no more than two; but the sects in Scotland form a large family of sisters, and the chalk lines are thickly drawn, and run through the midst of many private homes. Edinburgh is a city of churches, {{as though it were a}} place of pilgrimage. You will see four within a stone-cast at the head of the West Bow. Some are crowded to the doors; some are empty like monuments; and yet you will ever find new ones in the building. Hence that surprising clamour of church bells that suddenly breaks out upon the Sabbath morning from Trinity and the sea-skirts to Morningside on the borders of the hills. I have heard the chimes of Oxford playing their symphony in a golden autumn morning, and beautiful it was to hear. But in Edinburgh all manner of loud bells join, or rather <b>disjoin,</b> in one swelling, brutal babblement of noise. Now one overtakes another, and now lags behind it; now five or six all strike on the pained tympanum at the same punctual instant of time, and make together a dismal chord of discord; and now for a second all seem to have conspired to hold their peace. Indeed, there are not many uproars in this world more dismal than that of the Sabbath bells in Edinburgh: a harsh ecclesiastical tocsin; the outcry of incongruous orthodoxies, calling on every separate conventicler to put up a protest, each in his own synagogue, against ‘right-hand extremes and left-hand defections.’ And surely there are few worse extremes than this extremity of zeal; and few more deplorable defections than this disloyalty to Christian love. Shakespeare wrote a comedy of ‘Much Ado about Nothing.’ The Scottish nation made a fantastic tragedy on the same subject. And it is for the success of this remarkable piece that these bells are sounded every Sabbath morning on the hills above the Forth. How many of them might rest silent in the steeple, how many of these ugly churches might be demolished and turned once more into useful building material, if people who think almost exactly the same thoughts about religion would condescend to worship God under the same roof! But there are the chalk lines. And which is to pocket pride, and speak the foremost word? ...|$|E

40|$|Provided the <b>disjoining</b> {{pressure}} is positive and monotonically decreasing with film thickness, {{the motion of}} the film is unexceptional, exhibiting the usual smooth profiles associated with diffusive flow with time. However, for nonmonotonic <b>disjoining</b> pressures, the film is experimentally observed to exhibit vertical terraces. These abrupt jumps in height do not disappear with time and they move slowly or are stationary. This phenomenon is investigated here. We demonstrate how a physically consistent “weak” solution of the diffusion equation can be constructed, where only positive values of the diffusion coefficient are sampled. The film heights at the jump discontinuity are determined by an equal area rule for the <b>disjoining</b> pressure. Numerical simulations for a realistic nonmonotonic <b>disjoining</b> pressure exhibit finite termination on the low-side and vertical terraces, thereby matching the behavior observed in experimental systems. ...|$|R

[...] Deliriant is a technical term introduced to distinguish hallucinogens that primarily cause delirium (1982, from Latin deliro [...] "to be crazy" [...] and delira [...] "go out of the furrow"): [...] "An altered state of consciousness, consisting of confusion, distractibility, disorientation, disordered thinking and memory, defective perception (illusions and hallucinations), prominent hyperactivity, agitation, and autonomic nervous system overactivity; caused by illness, medication, or toxic, structural, and metabolic disorders." ...|$|E
5000|$|The highest {{philosophical}} interest, {{as distinguished}} from {{that which is}} more strictly psychological, attaches to the mode of mental association called Inseparable. The coalescence of mental states noted by Hartley, {{as it had been}} assumed by Berkeley, was farther formulated by James Mill in these terms:"Some ideas are by frequency and strength of association so closely combined that they cannot be separated; if one exists, the other exists along with it in spite of whatever effort we make to <b>disjoin</b> them." [...] (Analysis of the Human Mind, 2nd ed., vol. i, p. 93)J. S. Mill's statement is more guarded and particular:"When two phenomena have been very often experienced in conjunction, and have not, in any single instance, occurred separately either in experience or in thought, there is produced between them what has been called inseparable, or, less correctly, indissoluble, association; by which is not meant that the association must inevitably last to the end of life - that no subsequent experience or process of thought can possibly avail to dissolve it; but only that as long as no such experience or process of thought has taken place, the association is irresistible; it is impossible for us to think the one thing disjoined from the other." [...] (Examination of Hamilton's Philosophy, 2nd ed., p. 191)It is chiefly by J. S. Mill that the philosophical application of the principle has been made. The first and most obvious application is to so-called necessary truths, those that are not merely analytic judgments but involve a synthesis of distinct notions. Again, the same thinker sought to prove Inseparable Association the ground of belief in an external objective world. The former application, especially, is facilitated, when the experience through which the association is supposed to be constituted is understood as cumulative in the race, and transmissible as original endowment to individuals - endowment that may be expressed either, subjectively, as latent intelligence or, objectively, as fixed nervous connexions. Spencer, as suggested before, is the author of this extended view of mental association.|$|E
