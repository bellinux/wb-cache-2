5000|$|By 1825, he {{had started}} {{practical}} work on a steam carriage, taking space for a small workshop in Oxford Street and filing a first patent for [...] "An apparatus for propelling carriages on common roads or railways - {{without the aid of}} horses, with sufficient speed for the carriage of passengers and goods". His work encompassed the development of the blastpipe, which used steam to increase the flow of air through a steam engine's chimney, so increasing the <b>draw</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> over the fire and, in short, much increasing the power-to-weight ratio of the steam engine.|$|E
50|$|A spark {{arrester}} is often installed within the smokebox. This {{may take the}} form of a cylindrical mesh running from the top of the blast pipe to the bottom of the chimney. The purpose of a {{spark arrester}} is to prevent excessively large fragments of hot ash from being exhausted into the environment where they may pose a fire risk. For this reason, spark arresters are generally installed on locomotives running through dry environments. They should not be confused with the external spark arrestors fitted to some locomotives. The presence of a spark arrester may have a thermodynamic effect, distorting the <b>draw</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> over the fire and thereby reducing total power output. Thus their use can be contentious.|$|E
50|$|Air is {{provided}} by a diving regulator, which reduces the high pressure in a diving cylinder to the ambient pressure. The breathing performance of regulators is a factor when choosing a suitable regulator {{for the type of}} diving to be undertaken. It is desirable that breathing from a regulator requires low effort even when supplying large amounts of air. It is also recommended that it breathe smoothly without any sudden changes in resistance while inhaling or exhaling. In the graph, right, note the initial spike in pressure on exhaling to open the exhaust valve and that the initial drop in pressure on inhaling is soon overcome as the venturi effect designed into the regulator to allow an easy <b>draw</b> <b>of</b> <b>air.</b> Many regulators have an adjustment to change the ease of inhaling so that breathing is effortless.|$|E

After the Rainhill trials of 1829, there was considerable controversy as to the genesis of this invention since it became associated {{in the mind of the}} public with George Stephenson—probably through the agency of Samuel Smiles' biography of that man. In her 1875 letter to The Times, his daughter traces the path of the idea: Gurney communicated it to Timothy Hackworth, who employed it in his Royal George locomotive, from which Stephenson allegedly took his inspiration for its inclusion in the Rocket. More recent letters acquired by the National Railway Museum suggest that, in fact, Hackworth may have discovered the idea first and/or independently; and Herbert—clearly not a fan of Gurney—seeks to debunk claims for Gurney's invention by comparing the output of Gurney's carriages with those of Trevithick. Other problems faced by Gurney's claim to have invented this is the clear use of it by Trevithick as confirmed by contemporary notes and also the patent applied for it by another party in the early 19th century.|$|E

40|$|The power <b>draw</b> {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>air</b> compressors {{are primarily}} {{determined by the}} type of compressor control and the relationship between the compressor's output capacity and the compressed air demand in the plant. In this paper, we review the most common types of compressor control for small reciprocating and rotary air compressors, and derive relations for estimating compressed air output {{as a function of the}} type of control and motor loading. Using these relations, we develop a method to estimate the ratio <b>of</b> compressed <b>air</b> output to energy input, which we call the average operating efficiency, based on input power to the compressor. The measured power <b>draw</b> signatures <b>of</b> industrial <b>air</b> compressors operating in different control modes and with different loads are discussed as case studies.

50|$|Each {{unit had}} two large Forced Draught (FD) Fans. For {{efficiency}} these fans drew warm air from an intake {{at the top}} of the station. This combustion air was passed through the Air Heater which increased its temperature. Dampers were used to control the quantity <b>of</b> <b>air</b> admitted to the furnace and direct some <b>of</b> the <b>air</b> to the Primary Air (PA) Fans.There were also two large Induced Air (ID) Fans on each unit. These drew the hot gases from the Boiler, through the Air Heater where the heat is transferred to the incoming combustion air. The gases were then exhausted up the chimney. The exhaust flow of these fans was also controlled by dampers in the ducting.Working in tandem the Draught plant ensured the boiler was always under a slight vacuum. This created a <b>draw</b> <b>of</b> combustion <b>air</b> into the boiler and an exhaust to the chimney. The exhaust gases could not be allowed to cool below a certain temperature, as there was a risk of the sulfur and nitrogen oxides in the flue gases condensing and forming acids which could have damaged the ID Fans.|$|R

50|$|The {{invention}} of fan-assisted forced draft {{in the early}} 20th century removed the industrial chimney's original function, that <b>of</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>air</b> into the steam-generating boilers or other furnaces. With {{the replacement of the}} steam engine as a prime mover, first by diesel engines and then by electric motors, the early industrial chimneys began to disappear from the industrial landscape. Building materials changed from stone and brick to steel and later reinforced concrete, and the height of the industrial chimney was determined by the need to disperse combustion flue gases to comply with governmental air pollution control regulations.|$|R
50|$|The {{core of a}} vortex in air is {{sometimes}} visible because of a plume of water vapor caused by condensation in the low pressure and low temperature of the core; the spout of a tornado is an example. When a vortex line ends at a boundary surface, the reduced pressure may also draw matter from that surface into the core. For example, a dust devil is a column of dust {{picked up by the}} core <b>of</b> an <b>air</b> vortex attached to the ground. A vortex that ends at the free surface of a body of water (like the whirlpool that often forms over a bathtub drain) may <b>draw</b> a column <b>of</b> <b>air</b> down the core. The forward vortex extending from a jet engine of a parked airplane can suck water and small stones into the core and then into the engine.|$|R

500|$|It had {{not been}} clear to other {{designers}} just what Wright and Chapman had done with the Type 78, but by early 1978, Gordon Murray had grasped how the Lotus design was achieving its remarkable levels of grip. He also realised that the Alfa Romeo flat-12 engine used by Brabham that season was too wide to permit the Venturi tunnels needed for really significant ground effect. At Murray's instigation, Alfa went on to produce a V12 engine for the 1979 season. Ferrari, however, persisted with the flat-12 design and therefore lacked full ground effect until their disastrous 1980 season. In the meantime, Murray's idea was to use another way of reducing the pressure underneath the car. In 1970 the Chaparral 2J [...] "sucker car" [...] had proved significantly faster than its opposition in the North American Can-Am sportscar series. The 2J had two fans {{at the rear of}} the car driven by a dedicated two-stroke engine to <b>draw</b> large amounts <b>of</b> <b>air</b> from under the chassis, reducing pressure and creating downforce. It had suffered from reliability problems with the second engine before being banned by the sporting authorities.|$|R
25|$|An air bag is {{a safety}} feature {{designed}} to protect automobile passengers in a head-on collision. Most cars today have driver's side airbags and many have one {{on the passenger side}} as well. Located in the steering wheel assembly on the driver's side and in the dashboard on the passenger side, the air bag device responds within milliseconds of a crash. The original safety cushion was first created by John W. Hetrick in 1952. After a car accident that his family was involved in, Hetrick <b>drew</b> sketches <b>of</b> compressed <b>air</b> stored in a container. When a spring-loaded weight senses the car decelerating at a rapid enough rate, it opens a valve that allows the pressure in the container to fill a bag. With this knowledge, he developed his design until he was able to obtain a patent on the device on August 5, 1952. Later in 1967, Dr. Allen S. Breed invented and developed a key component for automotive use in 1967, the ball-in-tube inertial sensor for crash detection. Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation to Chrysler.|$|R
