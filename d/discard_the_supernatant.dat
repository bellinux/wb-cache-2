40|$|Authors: Alexandre Marques, Ernesto Nakayasu & Igor Almeida ### Abstract The {{protozoan}} parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the {{etiologic agent}} of Chagas disease, which affects {{millions of people}} in Latin America. T. cruzi has a complex life cycle characterized by several developmental forms present in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. In vertebrate mammalian hosts T. cruzi is found as intracellular amastigotes and bloodstream trypomastigotes. On the other hand, in the intestine of the insect (Reduvidae) vector epimastigotes and metacyclic trypomastigotes are the present forms. From all the developmental stages of the parasite, intracellular amastigotes are the most difficult to obtain in large amounts, since they are the only ones that grow inside the host cells. Here, we describe a simple and robust protocol that enables the isolation of either intracellular or extracellular amastigotes in large amounts. While intracellular amastigotes are obtained from infection of mammalian cell cultures, extracellular amastigotes are obtained by differentiating bloodstream trypomastigotes in axenic cultures. Both intracellular and extracellular amastigotes are purified by anion-exchange chromatography. ### Introduction Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, has a complex life cycle with different life-cycle stages between the insect vector (Reduvidae, popularly known as the kissing bug) and the mammalian host. In the insect midgut, non-proliferative infective bloodstream trypomastigote forms become proliferative, noninfective epimastigotes forms. These forms then replicate and, upon nutritional stress, can originate the infective metacyclic trypomastigotes. T. cruzi amastigogenesis occurs when metacyclic trypomastigotes from triatomine excreta infect mammals and differentiate into amastigotes inside host cells. These forms then multiply and transform into trypomastigotes that are released after rupturing the host cell plasma membrane, thus reaching the extracellular space and the bloodstream, where they can circulate and infect other cells and, eventually, another insect vector 1, 2. The scarcity of parasite molecules that have been identified as a potential molecular target(s) may limit the development of new drugs or vaccines for Chagas disease 3. Despite being essential for the proliferation and maintenance of the parasite inside the mammalian host, amastigote forms have been very poorly explored in the identification of new targets for vaccine development. The main {{reason for this is that}} these forms are difficult to obtain, owing to the fact that the few existing purification protocols are time-consuming and have low yield. Currently, following infection of Vero cells with trypomastigotes, intracellular amastigotes can be obtained in vitro by centrifugation using a discontinuous metrizamide 4 or Percoll 5 gradient. Here we describe a reliable method for purification of both intracellular and extracellular amastigotes, derived from Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigote forms obtained after infection of Rhesus monkey kidney epithelial LLC-MK 2 cells. The method is based on the principle that amastigotes, akin to metacyclic trypomastigotes, have a much less negatively-charged cell surface, because of the absence or low abundance of sialic acid residues transferred by the parasite trans-sialidase 6. Therefore, they can be separated from highly sialylated trypomastigote forms 6, using a weak anion-exchange resin, such as diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose or DE- 52. This approach has been previously used for the purification of metacyclic trypomastigotes 7, 8. Now we show that the anion-exchange chromatography can also be used for the purification of both extracellular and intracellular amastigote forms of T. cruzi. (fig. 1) ### Reagents 1.

BOD incubator, Napco Series 8000 WJ CO 2 Incubator, Thermo Scientific, USA. - Set at 5 % CO 2, 37 oC, and 95 % high relative humidity. - Eppendorf centrifuge 5810 R, 15 -amp version, Rotor A- 4 - 81. ### Procedure Cell culture for obtaining extracellular amastigotes: CAUTION! Trypanosoma cruzi is a highly infectious protozoan parasite, classified as a biosafety-level (BSL) 2 organism, thus a proper training is required before starting any of the experiments described here. All the experiments have to be done inside of a Class II biological safety cabinet and using adequate personal protection equipment (PPE). 1. Seed 5 × 10 e 6 LLC-MK 2 cells in sterile 150 cm 2 tissue culture flasks with 20 mL of complete DMEM. - Grow the cells for 3 - 4 days in the BOD incubator (37 C, 5 % CO 2). At this point the culture should reach confluency of about 2 × 10 e 7 cells per flask. - Change the medium with 20 mL of fresh complete DMEM and then infect the LLC-MK 2 cells with 1 × 10 e 8 trypomastigotes/flask - Grow the cells for four more days in the BOD incubator and harvest the supernatant, containing a mixture of trypomastigotes (about 72 %) and amastigotes (about 28 %), into a conical 50 -ml centrifuge tube. - Centrifuge the cells at 4, 000 xg for 10 min at 4 °C. - <b>Discard</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> and gently resuspend the pellet at 1 × 10 e 8 parasites/mL with fresh DMEM medium. - Incubate the parasite mixture in the BOD incubator for 2 days. At this point, up to 94 % parasites have been transformed into amastigotes. - Centrifuge the cells at 4, 000 xg for 10 min at 4 °C. - Incubate the cells again for 3 more hours at BOD incubator. This process helps to remove some remaining trypomastigotes, since they swim into the supernatant and the amastigotes stay in the bottom of the centrifuge tube. - <b>Discard</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> and resuspend the pellet in PSG at 1 × 10 e 8 parasites/mL. At this point, cells are ready to be purified by anion-exchange chromatography. Cell culture for obtaining intracellular amastigotes: 1. Seed 5 × 10 e 6 LLC-MK 2 cells in sterile plastic tissue 150 cm 2 culture flasks with 20 mL of complete DMEM. - Grow the cells for 3 - 4 days in the BOD incubator until they become confluent. - Change the medium with 20 mL fresh complete DMEM and then infect the LLC-MK 2 cells with 1 × 10 e 8 trypomastigotes/flask. - Grow the cells for 3 more days in the BOD incubator. - Detach the cells by gently scraping them in 5 mL PBS. - Disrupted the host cells by using gentle MACS Dissociator with M tubes (Miltenyi Biotec, USA), or by passing the cells once through a 27 -gauge needle connected to a 30 -mL syringe. - Centrifuge for 800 xg for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the large host-cell debris. - Collect the supernatant, centrifuge for 4, 000 xg for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspend the cells in PBS/BSA 10 %. - Incubate in the BOD incubator for 2 hours. - Centrifuge the cells at 4, 000 xg for 10 min at 4 °C. - Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL PBS, remove 20 µL and dilute 1 : 10 in PBS/paraformaldehyde 10 %. Count the cells in a hemocytometer. Purification of amastigotes by anion-exchange chromatography: Rationale: Amastigotes suspension is passed through the anion-exchange column to separate them from host-cell debris and trypomastigotes. In this experiment, negative charges of the parasite surface, mainly due to the sialic acid content, interact or bind to positively charged DE 52 medium. Since the content of sialic acid of trypomastigotes is higher, this parasite form strongly binds to the resin, whereas the amastigotes, which have no (intracellular forms) or less (extracellular forms) sialic acid content, bind only weakly to the positively charged column. 1. Prepared the column support with a 30 ml-syringe and a small piece of glass wool in the bottom. - Add 10 mL of pre-swollen resin microgranular anion-exchange resin DE 52 diethylaminoethyl cellulose. - Equilibrate the column twice with 50 ml PSG, by passing the buffer by gravity. - Load the parasites with 20 mL PSG, by gravity. - Wash the column with 20 mL PSG to remove host-cell debris. - Elute and collect the amastigotes with 20 mL PSG. - Centrifuge the cells at 4, 000 xg for 10 min at 4 °C. - Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL PBS, remove 20 µL and dilute 1 : 10 in PBS/paraformaldehyde 10 %. Count the cells in a hemocytometer. ### Timing The whole procedure from growing the LLC-MK 2 cells to the column chromatography takes 4 days for obtaining intracellular amastigotes and 6 days, for extracellular ones. ### Troubleshooting - Low purity of parasites: - Verify the column assembly: be careful with the amount of glass wood and resin added. Low parasite purity might mean less resin than needed to efficiently capture trypomastigote forms of the parasite. - The amount of the parasites obtained was lower than expected: - Increase the number of parasites used for infection. The infectivity of the parasite may depend on the strain. Also, T. cruzi trypomastigotes are well-known to become less infective after 7 to 10 cycles in cell culture, so they need to be passed through mice to recover virulence. ### Anticipated Results The expected recovery of amastigotes per 150 -cm 2 flask can vary. By infecting LLC-MK 2 monolayers with Y strain trypomastigotes, we are routinely able to obtain 1 × 10 e 8 and 5 × 10 e 8 of intracellular and extracellular amastigotes per 150 -cm 2 flask, respectively. For the purification step, starting with a mixture of ~ 63 % amastigotes and ~ 40 % trypomastigotes, we usually obtain a preparation of 98 - 99 % pure parasites (for either extracellular or intracellular amastigotes) after the anion-exchange chromatography. ### References 1.

Bernard 1 Corresponding author ([nicole. bernard@mcgill. ca](nicole. bernard@mcgill. ca)). ### INTRODUCTION The {{enzyme-linked}} immunospot (ELISPOT) assay {{measures the}} secretion intensity of effector molecules released by immune cells {{in response to}} ex vivo antigenic stimulation, {{as well as the}} frequency of these responding cells. This assay is highly sensitive, quantitative, easy to use, and amenable to high-throughput screening. For these reasons, the ELISPOT assay is considered by many as a gold standard for monitoring cellular immune responses. Until recently, ELISPOT assays using chromophores to detect the T cell secretion of cytokines were limited to the characterization of a single effector molecule. Notably, studies evaluating the immune response to chronic viral infections often measured IFN-γ secretion by ELISPOT because of the known antiviral effects of this cytokine as well as its correlation to the cytotoxic capacity of T cells. However, maintenance of both IFN-γ and IL- 2 secretion by pathogen-specific T cells has been linked to a more favorable clinical outcome in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Leishmania infections. Therefore, an ELISPOT assay able to simultaneously characterize T cell responses in terms of IL- 2 and IFN-γ secretion is potentially relevant for the monitoring of immune responses to certain infectious agents. In this protocol, we describe an ELISPOT assay for the simultaneous detection of IL- 2 and IFN-γ upon stimulation with viral peptides. ### RELATED INFORMATION Early uses of the ELISPOT assay for studies of immune cell secretion intensity and frequency are described in Currier et al. (2002) and Czerkinsky et al. (1988). The principles of the ELISPOT assay are reviewed in Letsch and Scheibenbogen (2003), and its use in high-throughput screening is described in Hernandez-Fuentes et al. (2003). The pathogen studies by Harari et al. (2005) illustrate the potential utility of simultaneous detection of IFN-γ and IL- 2 secretion for monitoring immune response. Darrah et al. (2007) demonstrate that immune responses secreting IFN-γ and IL- 2 and other cytokines play a protective role in a Leishmania major infection model. The assay presented in this protocol has also been described in Boulet et al. (2007). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1.

Permeabilize the MultiScreen IP white-walled ELISPOT plate by aliquoting 50 μL of 90 % MeOH from a 50 -mL plastic trough to each well using a multichannel pipette. Wait ~ 45 sec or until all the wells in the plate appear slightly translucent. - Immediately wash the plate with 1 X PBS, adding 200 μL from a 50 -mL plastic trough to each well using the multichannel pipette. Repeat four times. - *The goal of washing with ~ 200 μL of fluid is to remove specific reagents after each step. As such, the volume used for the washes {{does not have to be}} precisely 200 μL*. - Add 100 μL of coating buffer (dual, IL- 2, and IFN-γ) to the appropriate wells. - Seal plate in plastic wrap and incubate overnight at 4 °C. ***Thawing Cells (30 min) *** 5. Remove frozen PBMCs from the liquid nitrogen tank and thaw in a 37 °C waterbath, shaking gently until the frozen aliquot is reduced to a small ice pellet. 6. Transfer cells into a 15 -mL PP tube using a plastic transfer pipette and add ~ 10 mL of warm (37 °C) wash medium drop by drop while gently mixing the contents of the tube. Centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 7 min. 7. <b>Discard</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> by decanting, and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of warm (37 °C) wash medium. Centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 7 min. 8. Repeat Step 7, but remove a 30 -μL aliquot prior to centrifugation in order to count cells under the microscope. To count cells, dilute in Erythrosine B dye to check viability and use a hemacytometer. 9. After the last centrifugation, <b>discard</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> and resuspend PBMCs at 2 × 10 e 6 cells/mL in warm (37 °C) R 10 medium. Aliquot a maximum 10 e 7 (or 5 mL) cells per 50 -mL PP conical tube and incubate overnight in a humidified atmosphere incubator preset to 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. **Day 2 : Blocking Plates, Cell Plating** ***Blocking Plates (90 min) *** 10. Retrieve coated plates from the refrigerator and remove coating buffers by washing plates three times with 1 X PBS, adding 200 μL of 1 X PBS to each well with a multichannel pipette. *See Troubleshooting*. 11. Add 200 μL of blocking buffer and incubate for at least 1 h at room temperature. 12. Wash plates five times with 200 μL/well of 1 X PBS. Leave 200 μL per well of 1 X PBS until ready to proceed to Step 13. ***Cell Plating (2 h) *** 13. Remove 1 X PBS from ELISPOT plate and add stimuli in RPMI medium 1640 to appropriate wells in a volume of 50 μL (or 100 μL for the medium control). During this step, do not allow wells to dry. Once done, place plate in a humidified atmosphere incubator preset to 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. Stimuli are usually plated in triplicates and may include the following: - i. Medium control: 100 μL R 10 medium with no stimulus added. No cells are added to these wells in Step 15. - *No spots should be detected in Step 28. This controls for medium quality*. - ii. Negative control: 50 μL R 10 medium with no stimulus added. - *Unstimulated cells should give no or few spots in Step 28 *. - iii. Positive control: Anti-CD 3 mAb at a final well concentration of 0. 3 μg/mL. - iv. CEF control: Most individuals respond to this pool of peptides isolated from cytomegalovirus (C), Epstein-Barr virus (E), and influenza virus (F). - v. Peptides from infectious agent: Optimal peptides (8 - to 11 -mers) or 15 -mers are usually recommended. Pools of peptides may be used. Final concentration of the individual peptides or each peptide within a pool should be ~ 4 μg/mL. 14. Retrieve cells from the incubator and pool into a single 50 ‐mL PP tube. Add warm (37 °C) wash medium to fill the tube and remove a 30 -μL aliquot to count PBMCs. 15. Centrifuge cells at 1500 rpm for 7 min. <b>Discard</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> and resuspend the pellet in warm (37 °C) R 20 medium at 4 × 10 e 6 cells per mL. Retrieve plate from the incubator and add 50 μL of cells to appropriate wells. - *Do not add cells to the “medium control” wells (Step 13. i) *. 16. Incubate plate for 28 h in a humidified atmosphere incubator preset to 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. **Day 3 : Detection (30 min) ** 17. Wash ELISPOT plate: - i. Three times with 1 X PBS, 200 μL per well. - ii. Three times with PBS-T buffer, 200 μL per well. 18. Add 100 μL per well of detection buffer. 19. Seal plate in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight at 4 °C. **Day 4 : Spot Color Development (3. 5 h) ** 20. Wash the ELISPOT plate: - i. Three times with PBS-T buffer using 200 μL per well. Between each wash, empty wash fluid into a container. - ii. Three times with PBS-T buffer using 200 μL per well and the VPW. 21. Add 100 μL of developing buffer to all wells using a multichannel pipette and incubate at room temperature for at least 2 h. 22. Wash the ELISPOT plate: - i. Twice with 200 μL per well of PBS-T buffer, pouring off the wash buffer between each wash step. - ii. Twice with PBS-T buffer using 200 μL per well and the VPW. - iii. Three times with 200 μL per well of 1 X PBS, using the VPW. - iv. Once with 200 μL per well of filtered H 2 O. 23. Add 100 μL per well of Vector Blue solution and incubate for ~ 5 min at room temperature. 24. Remove Vector Blue solution and wash the ELISPOT plates: - i. Three times with 200 μL per well of 1 X PBS, pouring off the wash buffer between each wash step. - ii. Three times with 200 μL of 1 X PBS, using the VPW. 25. Activate AEC buffer by adding 4. 8 μL of H 2 O 2 to 10 mL of AEC buffer and filter through a 0. 45 -μm filter. Add 100 μL per well of activated AEC buffer to each well and incubate up to 5 - 10 min. 26. Wash the ELISPOT plate: - i. Twice with 200 μL per well of filtered H 2 O, using the VPW. - ii. One minute under running tap H 2 O. Remove the bottom of the ELISPOT plate and wash both sides of the membrane. 27. Air-dry the plates. 28. Take a picture of the wells and count spots using the CTL-Immunospot Analyzer as described by the manufacturer. If a picture of the plates cannot be taken and counted on the same day, keep the plates away from light until it can be done. - *For counting spots, sensitivity and compensation are set using wells coated with either anti-IL- 2 or anti-IFN-γ coating buffer (Step 3), in which cells were stimulated with one of the positive control stimuli, i. e., CEF or anti-CD 3 mAb (Step 13). Wells coated with anti-IL- 2 coating buffer should contain only blue spots. Wells coated with anti-IFN-γ coating buffer should contain only red spots*. - i. Set sensitivity for each color separately, such that a maximum number of spots are detected in each of the anti-IL- 2 or anti-IFN-γ coated wells. - ii. Using the software’s embedded algorithm, set compensation such that no blue spots are detected in the wells coated with anti-IFN-γ coating buffer and that no red spots are detected in the wells coated with anti-IL- 2 coating buffer. - *Using these settings, a spot that represents the footprint of both IFN-γ and IL- 2 secretion appears purple and is detected when the color of a spot meets the threshold at the intersection of both single colors*. - iii. Count the cells in each of the three types of antigen-specific cell populations: single IFN-γ responding cells, single IL- 2 responding cells, and IFN-γ/IL- 2 dual cytokine responding cells. - iv. Always audit the counts obtained from the software well-by-well. *See Troubleshooting*. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: Wells leak coating buffer. **[Step 10]** - **Solution**: Treatment with MeOH in Step 1 may be too long. Make sure exposure of the wells to MeOH is kept to a minimum. If the problem persists, try less concentrated MeOH solutions or replace MeOH with ethanol. - **Problem**: The positive control is weak or negative. **[Step 28]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Avoid using cells for which viability is < 70 % after thawing (Step 8). - 2. Avoid cell stress, such as prolonged exposure to concentrated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), insufficient medium, insufficient CO 2, or prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. - 3. Increase incubation time in Step 23 and/or Step 25. - **Problem**: Spot quality is poor. **[Step 28]** - **Solution**: Spot quality can be affected in several ways: - 1. A spot with a white center is the result of improper washing of the plate during Step 17; cells remain bound to the membrane and create a “ghost” image during development. Make sure plates are washed vigorously. - 2. Double spots or spots with a cobweb appearance result from plate displacement occurring during Step 16. Ensure plates are not moved during incubation and that the incubator is not located in an active area or near vibrating equipment (e. g., a centrifuge). - 3. Spots that are too dark with a black center make compensation with the counting instrument difficult. Reduce incubation time in Step 23 and/or Step 25. - **Problem**: The response to background stimuli is elevated. **[Step 28]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Avoid cell stress (see solution above for the positive control being weak or negative). - 2. Put cells on a shaker during Step 9 to avoid cell clumping. - 3. In wash steps using R 10 and R 20 media, screen lots of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to identify ones supporting low background. Some lots result in increased background and it is recommended that these be tested prior to use. If the problem persists, replace FBS with human AB serum. - 4. Check reagents for contaminants. - 5. Filtration may remove precipitated material that could cause background. ### DISCUSSION Immune monitoring methods have become essential tools for understanding the correlates of protective immune responses. The dual-color ELISPOT assay described in this protocol allows for the simultaneous detection of antigen-specific T cells secreting IFN-γ and/or IL- 2. The rationale for selecting cytokines to target in a dual-color ELISPOT assay may vary based on the experimental question being posed. IFN-γ secretion is an antiviral T cell function that is resistant to functional exhaustion in the course of infections characterized by high persistent antigen load and it is the cytokine most frequently assessed in standard ELISPOT assays used to monitor vaccine trials (Shiver et al. 2002; Wherry et al. 2003; Harari et al. 2005; Hill et al. 2007; Kester et al. 2008). IL- 2 secretion, on the other hand, is sensitive to functional exhaustion in a setting of high persistent antigen load. However, it tends to identify responses that are more likely to be multifunctional, i. e., have the ability to proliferate and effectively control viral replication (Wherry et al. 2003; Harari et al. 2004; Zimmerli et al. 2005). Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) is also used to characterize antigen-specific immune responses. It has the advantage of allowing for extensive phenotyping and functional analyses of the responding cells. However, ICS usually requires a greater number of PBMCs per condition tested, and it is more expensive and less amenable to high-throughput screening than the ELISPOT assay. The ELISPOT assay is at least as sensitive (if not more so) than ICS for detecting antigen-specific cells (Sun et al. 2003; Streek et al. 2009). In resource-limited settings, comprehensive screening with the dual-color ELISPOT could be used to identify specificities that could later be further phenotypically and functionally characterized by multiparametric flow cytometry. Although both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses can be detected with the dual-color ELISPOT, the use of optimal peptides or overlapping 15 -mers usually favors the detection of antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells (Boulet et al. 2007; Ndongala et al. 2009). However, the ELISPOT assay also allows for the stimulation of T cells with complex antigens such as whole proteins, cell lysates, or whole or apoptotic cells. In the case of complex antigens, these would need to be pre-incubated with antigen-presenting cells (APC) (Schmittel et al. 2000). In this case, antigens would be processed by the APC and appropriately presented to CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells, with co-stimulatory signals, according to each cell’s specific requirements. In this context, CD 4 + T cells may be more effectively stimulated and, therefore, their responses more accurately detected. In addition, stimulation of T cells with APCs previously exposed to the antigen may favor the detection of antigen-specific cells that were not previously primed in vivo. If the dual-color ELISPOT protocol is adapted to utilize antigen-pulsed APCs as a stimulus, then the APC-priming procedure and incubation time with the responder cells should be optimized. Another caveat of this method is the decreased magnitude of IFN-γ responses, by ~ 15 %, in wells where both IL- 2 and IFN-γ are captured when compared to wells coated with IFN-γ alone (Boulet et al. 2007). This may be a consequence of the mAb-mediated sequestration of IL- 2, which is a known inducer of IFN-γ. Depending on the type of study undertaken, it is therefore necessary to determine whether the information gained from simultaneously detecting both cytokines outweighs the cost of a decreased IFN‐γ magnitude. The dual-color ELISPOT assay has been used to demonstrate the importance of the link between the predominance of different T cell functional subsets in HIV-infected individuals with different clinical outcomes or at different stages of disease (Peretz et al. 2007; Ndongala et al. 2009). ### REFERENCES 1.

Based on DNA content alone, however, cells in the quiescent G 0 phase cannot be discriminated from cells in the proliferative G 1 phase, as DNA content remains constant until S-phase entry. In contrast, by measuring RNA content in addition to DNA content, cells can be assigned to G 0 and cell-cycle subcompartments of G 1. Assessing phenotype {{at the same time}} as nucleic acid content allows determination of the cell-cycle status of subpopulations in mixed-cell preparations. This protocol describes an optimized method for combining dual-color cell-surface immunofluorescent staining with staining for DNA-RNA, adapted for a basic dual-laser flow cytometer with blue (488 -nm) and red (633 - or 647 -nm) excitation. DNA is stained at low pH in the presence of saponin with 7 -aminoactinomycin D (7 -AAD), and RNA is stained with pyronin Y (PY). Both dyes are used at low concentration, and 7 -AAD is exchanged with nonfluorescent actinomycin D to minimize fluorochrome-fluorochrome interactions, which can negatively affect detection of cell-surface antigen staining. ### RELATED INFORMATION This protocol was adapted from Schmid et al. (2000). An extensive description of flow cytometry principles, as well as various techniques for assessment of nucleic acid content by flow cytometry, can be found in Practical Flow Cytometry (Shapiro 2003). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Actinomycin D (AD) stock solution (1 mg/mL) - 7 -aminoactinomycin D (7 -AAD) stock solution (1 mg/mL) - Antibody staining solution - Human cells of interest, fresh or cultured (or immortalized human cell lines) - Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against cell surface antigens of interest (biotinylated or labeled with an appropriate fluorochrome), and isotype-matched controls - *The protocol described here uses one biotinylated mAb in combination with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 and one mAb directly conjugated to allophycocyanin (APC) for combining dual-color immunofluorescence with DNA-RNA staining. See Troubleshooting and Discussion for further information on strategies for fluorochrome selection and staining*. - Nucleic acid staining solution (NASS) (pH 4. 8) - Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 1 X, without Ca++ and Mg++) - Pyronin Y(G) (PY) stock solution (1 mg/mL) - Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 ### Equipment 1. Bucket with ice - Centrifuge - Flow cytometer with 488 -nm blue excitation and 633 -nm or 647 -nm red excitation, and the appropriate filter sets for collecting emissions from Alexa Fluor 488, PY, 7 -AAD, and APC - Incubator, preset to optimal temperature for cells of interest ### METHOD **Cell-Surface Staining** 1. Place 1 × 10 e 6 PBS-washed cells into a tube, add 100 μL of antibody staining solution, and mix well. In addition, prepare cells to be stained with isotype-matched control antibodies, as well as cells to be stained with a single color, to be used as controls during flow cytometry. - *The preparation of samples stained with isotype-matched control antibodies is necessary for determination of background staining. The preparation of single-color control samples is necessary to determine the fluorescence overlap of APC and Alexa Fluor 488 into other detectors on the flow cytometer and to set accurate fluorescence compensation*. - Label the cell-surface proteins of interest: - i. Add appropriate amounts of a biotinylated mAb and an APC-labeled mAb to the cell sample. - ii. Incubate the cells protected from light, using the optimal incubation temperature and time for the antibodies selected. - *If the cell surface protein of interest is expressed at high levels, it may be possible to use a mAb that is directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, omitting the need for indirect staining using a biotinylated antibody. If this is the case, omit Steps 3 and 4, and proceed directly to Step 5 *. - Wash the cells once by adding 2 mL of antibody staining solution and centrifuging at 250 g for 5 min at 4 °C. <b>Discard</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant.</b> - To the cell pellet, add 100 μL of antibody staining solution containing an appropriate amount of streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488. Incubate for 20 min at 4 °C. - Wash the cells once by adding 2 mL of antibody staining solution and centrifuging at 250 g for 5 min at 4 °C. <b>Discard</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant.</b> **DNA and RNA Staining** 6. Stain cells with 7 -AAD: - i. Resuspend the cells from Step 5 in 0. 5 mL of NASS containing 10 μg/mL of 7 -AAD. Incubate for 20 min at 20 °C- 25 °C, protected from light. - ii. Prepare a cell sample that is stained only with 7 -AAD (without any cell surface staining). - *This sample is necessary to determine the amount of fluorescence overlap of 7 -AAD into other detectors on the flow cytometer and to set the appropriate fluorescence compensation*. 7. Add 1 mL of 1 X PBS to each sample. Collect the cells by centrifugation at 250 g for 5 min. Discard the PBS. 8. Stain cells with PY: - i. Resuspend each cell pellet in 0. 5 mL of NASS containing 10 μg/mL of AD. Place the mixture on ice for 5 min, protected from light. - ii. Add 5 μL of a 1 : 10 dilution of the PY stock solution (made with H 2 O), and vortex immediately. Keep the cells on ice, protected from light, for at least 10 min before sample acquisition on the flow cytometer. - It is possible to keep cells in the staining solution protected from light at 4 °C for a maximum of 3 d before sample acquisition on the flow cytometer, without adverse effects. - iii. Prepare a sample of cells stained only with PY (without any cell-surface or 7 -AAD staining). - This sample is necessary to determine the amount of fluorescence overlap of PY into other detectors on the flow cytometer and to set the appropriate fluorescence compensation. 9. Run samples on the flow cytometer using a low sample differential. Collect the fluorescence signals for cell-surface immunofluorescence with log amplification. Collect the DNA and RNA signals with linear amplification (Fig. 1). ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Application of the method for concurrent flow cytometric measurement of two cell-surface antigens and DNA-RNA content. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured for 72 h, either in medium alone (A-D) or in medium containing 100 ng/mL of soluble CD 28. 2 (Biodesign) in the presence of 100 ng/mL of surface-bound OKT 3 (Ortho Diagnostics) (E-H). (C and G) Analysis of CD 5 +CD 8 + T cells; RNA/DNA dot-plots were gated on scatter as shown in row 1 (in A and E) and R 1 (in B) or R 2 (in F), respectively. (D and H) Analysis of CD 5 -CD 8 + cells; RNA/DNA dot-plots were gated on scatter as shown in row 1 (in A and E) and on R 3 (in B) or R 4 (in F), respectively. After 3 d in culture without stimulation, CD 8 + cells, irrespective of CD 5 expression, did not leave G 0. As expected, with CD 3 /CD 28 activation, CD 8 + cells that coexpressed CD 5 (a human T lymphocyte antigen) proliferated, while CD 5 -CD 8 + (NK cells) remained in G 0. After 72 h of costimulation, only 9 % of CD 5 +CD 8 + T cells remained in G 0; ~ 15 % were in G 1 a, 21 % were in G 1 b, and the rest were represented in the S + G 2 +M phases of the cell cycle. *Running samples at a low sample pressure lowers the coefficient of variation (CV) of the DNA measurement. Low CVs improve the accuracy of data analysis by facilitating deconvolution of DNA histograms by flow cytometry DNA analysis software programs. See Troubleshooting*. *A standard practice employed for reliable DNA analysis is doublet discrimination. This can be achieved by acquiring area and width signals in the channel used for measuring DNA fluorescence. If this is not possible due to instrument limitations, displaying area versus height signals or gating on light scatter signals (Fig. 1) can also be used to exclude cell aggregates during data analysis*. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The DNA profiles have a high CV. **[Step 9]** - **Solution**: The low pH of the NASS improves access of 7 -AAD to the DNA, resulting in DNA staining with low CV. Despite this, samples that are run through the flow cytometer at high sample pressure will be measured with decreased precision and higher CVs. In addition, there is fluorescence overlap between 7 -AAD and PY. If the overlap is not compensated correctly, the 7 -AAD peaks will widen. Also, if substantial numbers of cells are dying, their degrading DNA will lead to broad DNA distributions. Solutions involve removing dead cells by Ficoll gradient or choosing an earlier time point for analysis (before the cells start to die). - **Problem**: The detection of cellular subpopulations needs improvement. - **Solution**: This protocol was optimized for detection of surface antigens by using low nucleic acid dye concentrations and exchanging 7 -AAD with nonfluorescent AD. This serves to reduce background fluorescence caused by the dyes in solution and to minimize fluorochrome interactions. Data obtained with these low concentrations matched the results obtained for DNA-RNA staining with standard concentrations of 7 -AAD and PY. Therefore, because nucleic acid dye concentrations must be maintained at the levels described in the Method section, strategies to improve the brightness of signal detection should focus on the mAb staining step (Step 2). These strategies involve selecting the brighter fluorochrome for the cell-surface antigen with low abundance, titrating the mAb to achieve the best separation between background and positive cells, using indirect staining to amplify the fluorescent signal, and selecting different mAb clones that may provide better staining. ### DISCUSSION In mixed-cell preparations, analysis of surface antigen expression in combination with cell-cycle events is essential for the determination of the growth status of cellular subpopulations. Measurement of DNA content by flow cytometry using different fluorescent dyes for staining DNA is compatible with simultaneous detection of cell surface antigens, but only identifies the three basic phases of the cell cycle: G 0 / 1, S, and G 2 +M. Cells that are actively progressing through the S phase can be identified in flow cytometry by combining measurement of DNA content with bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, an assay comparable to the assessment of thymidine incorporation using a radioactive label. However, the DNA denaturation step required in many BrdU staining protocols to make incorporated BrdU accessible to anti-BrdU antibodies can affect simultaneous detection of other immunochemical parameters. Bivariate analysis of DNA content and cyclin expression, which varies during cell-cycle progression, provides a framework for the subdivision of the cell cycle into distinct subcompartments. The success of this technique relies on suitable cell-fixation, cell-permeabilization, and dependable antibodies specific for the various types of cyclin proteins that have been proven to work in flow cytometry. In addition to DNA content, the determination of RNA content is another approach for assigning cells to various cell-cycle compartments and for discriminating G 0 from different stages within G 1. Several techniques have been developed for DNA-RNA content measurement by flow cytometry. One method involves differential staining of DNA-RNA with acridine orange (AO) (Darzynkiewicz et al. 1980). Accurate measurement of DNA-RNA content using AO is rather complex and depends on stringent staining conditions. In addition, AO, due to its broad emission spectrum, cannot be combined with other common fluorochromes used for antibody labeling. Another method is the simultaneous analysis of DNA and RNA content using Hoechst 33342 and PY (Shapiro 1981). This assay requires ultraviolet excitation, which is not available on most benchtop flow cytometers. Alternatively, Toba et al. (1995) described a 7 -AAD/PY DNA-RNA staining method that is compatible with cell-surface antigen staining with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC) -labeled antibodies. This protocol describes a method optimized for the concurrent measurement of two cell-surface antigens using a standard dual-laser flow cytometer. Cell-surface staining is presented using one antibody that is directly labeled with APC, and a second, biotinylated antibody that is detected with Alexa Fluor 488 -labeled streptavidin (Fig. 1). If a given cell-surface antigen is expressed at high levels, mAbs that are directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 can be used, shortening the time required for staining. Conversely, it is possible to use one unlabeled mAb that is then detected with a fluorochrome-labeled species-specific antiserum. This strategy can be used to amplify the signal obtained with low-abundance cell-surface antigens. Note, however, that for dual cell-surface labeling, the first and second staining steps for the unlabeled mAb need to be completed before staining with the other, directly labeled mAb. Otherwise, the antiserum will bind to both mAbs (unless each was made in a different species). New fluorochromes have recently become available for flow cytometry that may be compatible with this protocol. The selection of fluorochrome labels for cell-surface staining with emissions that can be separated from the emissions of 7 -AAD (peak emission at 650 nm) and PY (peak emission at 580 nm) is necessary. The fluorochromes must also be compatible with the acidic NASS solution (pH 4. 8). For instance, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) cannot be used, because FITC fluorescence is lost in acidic solutions. Before new labels are incorporated into this staining protocol, it is necessary to determine whether they retain sufficient brightness for detection of a given cell-surface antigen. ### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The author thanks Dr. Steve Cole for performing cell cultures and the late Dr. Janis V.

Target cells that had one or more receptors removed using enzymatic treatment were prelabeled with intracellular dyes CFDA-SE or DDAO-SE, incubated with P. falciparum parasites, and parasites that had invaded either labeled or unlabeled cells were detected with fluorescent DNA-intercalating dyes Hoechst 33342 or SYBR Green I. Neither cell label interfered with erythrocyte invasion, and the combination of cell and parasite dyes recapitulated known invasion phenotypes for three standard laboratory strains. Three different dye combinations with minimal overlap have been validated, meaning the same assay {{can be adapted to}} instruments harboring several different combinations of laser lines. The assay is sensitive, operates in a 96 -well format, and can be used to quantitate the impact of natural or experimental genetic variation on erythrocyte invasion efficiency. ### Introduction Flow cytometry has clear applications to phenotyping malaria parasites, particularly during the intraerythrocytic stages. Because erythrocytes are anuclear, erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum can be detected and distinguished from noninfected erythrocytes using DNA dyes, and several cytometric protocols have now been published using flow cytometry to count P. falciparum growth using fluorescent DNA dyes (1 - 3). However, such assays alone cannot be used to phenotype erythrocyte invasion because phenotyping invasion depends not only on counting parasites but also counting which erythrocytes the parasites have invaded. All invasion assays involve adding P. falciparum parasites to erythrocytes with a limited subset of erythrocyte receptors (for example, erythrocytes from known human blood group variants or erythrocytes that have been treated with enzymes to remove specific receptors) and scoring parasite density 48 h later. The reason that standard growth assays cannot be applied in this context is because uninfected (and hence untreated) erythrocytes are always present at some level in the starting parasite culture (referred to hereafter as ‘‘donor’’ cells). For invasion to be phenotyped, it is essential that parasites present in donor cells are not counted, whereas parasites that have invaded the erythrocytes with a reduced receptor repertoire (referred to hereafter as ‘‘target’’ cells) are counted. In previous assays, this fundamental problem in phenotyping invasion has been overcome by one of two approaches. In one, purification methods are used in an attempt to eliminate all uninfected erythrocytes from the donor culture, but purification requires larger volumes of culture and is not suited to high throughput assays of multiple lines. The widely used alternative involves pretreating the donor culture with a combination of enzymes, usually neuraminidase and trypsin, in order to cleave all available erythrocyte invasion receptors. This approach is designed to prevent reinvasion into all uninfected erythrocytes present in the donor culture and limit invasion to the target erythrocytes (4, 5). This has recently been successfully combined with a fluorescent DNA dye to allow measurement using flow cytometry (6), but necessarily involves serial manipulation of the P. falciparum culture and exposing it to enzymes that are sometimes present in nonphysiological buffers. To minimize parasite handling, two-color flow cytometry was investigated as an alternative to quantitate erythrocyte invasion. Unlabeled donor P. falciparum cultures were coincubated with target erythrocytes that had been labeled with fluorescent dyes, and parasites present in the donor and target population were quantitated using fluorescent DNA dyes. Multiple DNA dyes were tested and protocols adjusted to minimize background. Cell dyes were chosen to have minimal emission overlap with the best performing DNA dyes and to label erythrocytes cytoplasmically rather than on the erythrocyte surface as has been used previously (7), reasoning that surface labels may reduce invasion efficiencies and therefore reduce the sensitivity of the assay. This combinational approach resulted in the identification of several dye combinations that recapitulate known invasion phenotypes, meaning that the assay can be adapted to multiple flow cytometers, depending on the laser lines available. This 96 -well plate-based adaptable phenotyping platform should be of broad utility for measuring the impact of natural or experimental genetic variation in either host or parasite on erythrocyte invasion efficiency and could be applied to genotype-phenotype association studies. ### Reagents See PDF file [sop-flow-cytometry-invasion-assay. pdf]([URL] ### Equipment See PDF file [sop-flow-cytometry-invasion-assay. pdf]([URL] ### Procedure For the complete detailed protocol, see PDF file [sop-flow-cytometry-invasion-assay. pdf]([URL] **Part A – Labeling target RBC** The choice of fluorescent label for target RBC is dependent on the choice of DNA dye, which itself depends on the flow cytometer that will be used to acquire the data {{at the end of the}} invasion assay. The fluorescence emission peak of CFDA SE is approximately 517 nm, close to SYBR Green I at about 520 nm. CFDA SE can thus only be used in combination with Hoechst 33342. The fluorescence emission peak of DDAO SE is close to 657 nm. So, it can be used in combination with either Hoechst 33342 or SYBR Green I. 1.

It is based on mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell lines that express, from the endogenous loci, remodelers fused with a tandem affinity purification (TAP) -tag. Two versions of the TAP-tag, introduced at the C terminus, have been used successfully: (FLAG 3 -TEV-HA) and (FLAG-HA). ES cells are first fixed either with formaldehyde, or {{with a combination of}} disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) and formaldehyde. ES cells are then permeabilized, and incubated with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to fragment the genome into mononucleosomes. These nucleosomes are then incubated with agarose beads coupled with an antibody against HA or FLAG epitopes. After a series of washes, tagged-remodeler-nucleosome complexes are eluted, either by TEV protease cleavage or by peptide competition. The eluted protein is then subjected to a second immunopurification step, using beads coupled to the antibody against the second HA or FLAG epitope. After elution, DNA is extracted from the highly purified mononucleosome fraction, and processed for high-throughput sequencing. ### Materials 1. Solution I: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 15 mM, Sucrose 0. 3 M, KCl 60 mM, NaCl 15 mM, MgCl 2 5 mM, EGTA 0. 1 mM Solution II: Solution I with 0. 6 % (v/v) IGEPAL CA- 630 (SIGMA, ref. I 3021) - MNase buffer: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 20 mM, Sucrose 0. 34 M, KCl 15 mM, NaCl 60 mM, CaCl 2 1 mM - TKNSE buffer: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 20 mM, Sucrose 0. 34 M, KCl 15 mM, NaCl 60 mM, EDTA 4 mM - TEGN: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 20 mM, NaCl 150 mM, MgCl 2 3 mM, EDTA 0. 1 mM, 10 % Glycerol, 0. 01 % IGEPAL - SDS elution buffer: 1 % SDS, 0. 1 M NaHCO 3 ### Procedure 1. Preparation of ES cells - Prior to the experiment, expand ES cells to twelve 70 - 80 % confluent 10 cm culture dishes (1. 5. 10 e 7 cells/dish). Tagged ES cells are cultured at 37 °C, 5 % CO 2, on mitomycin C-inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (feeder cells), in DMEM (Sigma) with 15 % fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), L-Glutamine (Invitrogen), MEM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), pen/strep (Invitrogen), 2 -mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and a saturating amount of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), as described in (Tessarollo, 2001). - The day before the experiment, pass the cells into twenty five 10 cm culture dishes coated with gelatin, without feeder cells. Between 30 and 50. 10 e 7 cells are expected for one tandem ChIP experiment. - The first day of the procedure, 2 h before starting the protocol, check the aspect and confluence of ES cells. Change the ES cell medium, using precisely 10 ml of fresh medium per 10 cm dish, and further incubate the cells for 2 h at 37 °C, 5 % CO 2. - Set a water bath at 37 °C, and refrigerate the centrifuge (e. g. 5810 R eppendorf centrifuge, with an A- 4 - 62 rotor). Put the following solutions on ice: Solution I, Solution II, MNase buffer, Complete 50 x (Roche, ref. 11836145001) and PBS 1 X. - When the 2 h incubation period in fresh medium is finished, trypsinize one dish and count the cells (these cells will be used only for counting, in order to calculate the amount of MNase required for genome fragmentation). We expect 1 to 2. 10 e 7 cells per dish. 2. Fixation. Caution: formaldehyde must be manipulated in a chemical fume hood. - Option 1 : Fixation with formaldehyde: - Remove the cells from the incubator and rapidly add 275 μl of formaldehyde 36. 5 % (SIGMA, ref. F 8775) in each dish, directly into the culture medium, and mix well. The final concentration of formaldehyde is 1 %. - Leave exactly 10 min at room temperature. - Option 2 : Fixation with DSG and formaldehyde: - Dilute DSG to 2 mM in PBS. The DSG (Di-(N-succinimidyl) glutarate, Sigma-Aldrich Ref. 80424) stock solution is 500 mM (50 mg in 306 μl of DMSO) - Wash the ES cell culture dishes with 10 ml PBS at room temperature, and remove the last bits of PBS by vacuum aspiration. - Add 4 ml of DSG 2 mM solution per 10 cm dish - Shake gently and make sure that the DSG solution has been in contact with all cells in the dish. - Keep the dishes at room temperature under the hood during 45 min. Shake gently 3 - 4 times during this period. - Add 4 ml of 2 % formaldehyde in PBS to each dish (final concentration 1 %). Mix well. - Leave exactly 10 min at room temperature. Removal of the fixation agent and collection of fixed ES cells - Quickly remove the formaldehyde (or DSG + formaldehyde) solution from the dishes by vacuum aspiration (transfer this waste into an appropriate trash recipient). - Immediately wash each dish with 10 ml of cold PBS, and remove the last bits of PBS by vacuum aspiration. Repeat this washing step once. - Add 2 ml of PBS (with protease inhibitors) per dish. - Scrap cells and collect them in four 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes. Store the collected cells on ice. - Centrifuge at 1000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C. - Wash each tube of cells twice with 10 ml PBS 1 x without protease inhibitors. - Wash each tube of cells once with 5 ml Solution I. - Centrifuge at 1000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C. 3. Permeabilization of ES cells with IGEPAL - Resuspend each of the four cell pellets in 2 ml Solution I with protease inhibitors. - Add 2 ml Solution II with protease inhibitors. - Mix gently by pipetting or inverting the tubes several times. - Leave 10 min on ice. During this step, the cells are permeabilized by IGEPAL. Note that because of the formaldehyde fixation, nuclei are not efficiently released from the cells. - Centrifuge 10 min at 2000 g (3153 rpm using an eppendorf A- 4 - 62 rotor), 4 °C. 4. Chromatin fragmentation by MNase - Wash each cell pellet twice with 6 ml MNase buffer (without protease inhibitors). - Resuspend each cell pellet in 500 μl MNase buffer (without protease inhibitors). - Mix well with ± 20 up-and-down, using a P 1000 pipetman. Make sure that there are no more clumps of cells. - Transfer the cell suspension of each conical centrifuge tube into a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. Store on ice. - Dilute MNase (New England Biolab, ref. M 0247 S, 200 units/μl) to a concentration of 10 units/μl in MNase buffer. - Add MNase to each microfuge tube. 60 - 75 units of MNase are required to digest the chromatin of 10 million cells. The optimal amount of MNase has to be tested for each new batch of enzyme. The proper amount of MNase will release mostly mononucleosomes, but di- and tri-nucleosomes should still be visible when a sample is run onto a 1. 3 % agarose gel. - Mix well with a P 1000 pipetman. - Incubate 10 min at 37 °C in a water bath. Mix once by inverting the tubes after 5 min of incubation. - Transfer on ice, and add to each tube 20 μl EDTA 100 mM pH 8, 10 μl Complete 50 x, and 5 μl of PMSF 0. 1 M. Store on ice. - Make 4 cycles of sonication using, for instance, a Diagenode Bioruptor: 20 s ON / 40 s OFF. The purpose of this limited sonication step is not to shear chromatin, but to optimize the release of mononucleosomes from the MNase-digested cells. - Centrifuge at 14 000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C. - Collect and pool the supernatants of the four tubes, which correspond to the input chromatin, ready for the first Immunopurification step. Discard the pellets. Collect an 80 μl aliquot of this input chromatin for DNA analysis and quantification, and for western blot analysis. DNA preparation from input chromatin Before DNA analysis, the formaldehyde-mediated cross-link must be reversed. - In a new microfuge tube, add 20 μl of input chromatin, 480 μl H 2 O, 20 μl NaCl 5 M and 0. 5 μl RNase A (30 μg/μl). - Incubate overnight at 65 °C. - add 10 μl EDTA 0. 5 M, 20 μl Tris-HCl 1 M pH 8. 0 and 4 μl proteinase K 10 mg/ml. Incubate 2 h at 55 °C. - Add 500 μl Phenol/Chloroform, vortex 30 s, and centrifuge 10 min at 13000 rpm, at room temperature. - Collect the aqueous phase and transfer to a new 1. 5 microfuge tube. - Add 50 μl of NaAc 3 M pH 5. 2. Mix. - Add 1 ml 100 % ethanol (- 20 °C), and mix by inverting 10 times the tubes. - Precipitate DNA 1 h at - 20 °C (or overnight at 4 °C). - Centrifuge 15 min at 4 °C, 13000 rpm. <b>Discard</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant,</b> centrifuge again for 30 s and remove the last drop of liquid. - Wash the DNA pellet with 500 μl of 70 % ethanol. Centrifuge and discard all the liquid. - Add 20 TE (Tris-HCl pH 8, 0. 1 mM EDTA). Once prepared, the DNA is run onto a 1. 3 % agarose gel, to analyze the distribution of mono- and oligo-nucleosomes in the input chromatin. In addition, DNA is quantified by measuring the OD at 260 nm. 5. Preparation of HA- or FLAG-agarose beads for steps 1 and 2 of the tandem affinity purification scheme Anti-HA-agarose (ref. A 2095) and anti-FLAG-agarose (ref. A 2220) beads are purchased from SIGMA. - Resuspend the beads, and pipet the required amount of beads into a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube: 80 μl of beads (this is the volume of beads estimated after centrifugation, not the volume of slurry) for the first immunoprecipitation step, 40 μl for the second step. - Wash the beads three times with 10 ml TKNSE buffer. Centrifuge one min at 1000 rpm between each wash to collect the beads. - Keep the beads at 4 °C until use. 6. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation: first step of the tandem affinity protocol - In four 1. 5 ml microfuge tubes, mix 500 μl of input chromatin with 20 μl of HA antibody-agarose beads. - Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. - Pool the content of the four microfuge tubes into a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube. - Centrifuge 2 min at 1000 rpm, at 4 °C. - Take an 80 μl aliquot of the unbound fraction of the first IP as a control for western blot analysis (store on ice). - Wash the beads 8 times with 10 ml TEGN. - Resuspend in 500 μl TEGN if elution is to be made by TEV proteolysis, or in 300 μl of TEGN for elution by peptide competition (see below), and transfer into a new 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. - Take a 10 μl aliquot of this bead suspension to control the efficiency of the first immunoprecipitation by western blot. Store on ice until analysis. 7. Elution, first step of the tandem affinity protocol - Option 1 : Elution by TEV digestion TEV elution is efficient for the FLAG 3 -TEV-HA tag. For the simple FLAG-HA tag, go to option 2 (elution by peptide competition). - Add 50 μl TEV (1 mg/ml). - Incubate for 6 h at 30 °C, using a thermomixer set at 750 rpm. Check that the beads are well mixed, but not harshly, during this incubation. - Option 2 : Elution by peptide competition For proteins fused with a simple FLAG-HA tag, elution is performed by peptide competition. HA peptide (YPYDVPDYA) and FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) are solubilized at 4 μg/μl in 0. 5 M Tris-HCl (PH 7. 5). - Resuspend the bead pellet in 300 μl TEGN. Transfer into a 500 μl microfuge tube. - Add 100 μl of peptide (4 μg/μl). Use the HA peptide if you started your purification with the anti-HA antibody. - Add protease inhibitors: 8 μl Complete 50 x and 4 μl PMSF 0. 1 M. - Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. - After TEV digestion or peptide elution, transfer the mixture of beads and elution solution in a centrifuge column (Pierce®, 0. 8 ml, ref. 89868). - Centrifuge 1 min at 8000 rpm at room temperature. - Collect the eluate in a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube, store on ice. Collect also the beads in a separate tube, to control the efficiency of the elution process. - Take an aliquot of the eluate (e. g. 10 μl) and store on ice. 8. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation: second step of the tandem affinity protocol - Add 40 μl of beads coupled to the second antibody (e. g. anti-FLAG, if you have used the anti-HA in the first step of the protocol) to the eluate of the first purification step, in a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. - Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. - Transfer the content of the microfuge tube (beads in suspension) into a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube. - Centrifuge 2 min at 1000 rpm, at 4 °C. - Take an 80 μl aliquot of the unbound fraction of the second IP. Leave on ice until analysis. - Wash 8 times with 10 ml TEGN. - Centrifuge at 4 °C, 2 min at 1000 rpm. - Resuspend in 300 μl (final volume including the beads) TEGN and transfer into a 500 μl microfuge tube. 9. Elution, second step of the tandem affinity protocol - Add 100 μl of competitor peptide (4 μg/μl). - Incubate 5 h at room temperature on a rotating wheel. - Transfer the beads and eluate into a Pierce centrifuge column. - Centrifuge 1 min at 8000 rpm, at room temperature. - Collect the eluate into a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. This sample contains the chromatin eluted by peptide competition. Store on ice and collect a 40 μl aliquot for western blot analysis. Keep the beads for the second elution step with the SDS elution buffer. - Add 400 μl of preheated (55 °C) SDS elution buffer to the beads. - Agitate during 15 min onto a thermomixer (55 °C). - Transfer (beads+ eluate) in a centrifuge column. - Centrifuge 1 min at 8000 rpm, at room temperature. - Collect the eluate in a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. This sample corresponds to the second eluate, in which the chromatin remaining attached to the beads after peptide elution has been eluted by the action of SDS. - Take a 40 μl aliquot of eluate 2 and store all samples on ice or until Western blot analysis. 10. Western blot analysis - Run the samples collected at the various steps of the protocol on your favorite protein gel running and blotting system. For the agarose beads collected after the elution steps, directly add the SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer to the beads, heat as for liquid samples, centrifuge 30 s at 13 000 rpm, and load the supernatant onto the gel. The purification efficiency of the tagged protein during the tandem affinity ChIP protocol will be revealed by using an antibody against HA or FLAG epitope. 11. DNA preparation from the purified remodeler-nucleosomes complexes - Add to the eluates 170 μl H 2 O and 20 μl NaCl 5 M. - Incubate overnight at 65 °C for cross-link reversal. - add 10 μl EDTA 0. 5 M, 20 μl Tris-HCl 1 M pH 8. 0 and 4 μl proteinase K 10 mg/ml. Incubate 2 h at 55 °C. - Add 500 μl Phenol/Chloroform, vortex 30 s, and centrifuge 10 min at 13000 rpm, at room temperature. - Collect the aqueous phase and transfer to a new 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. - Add 25 μg of glycogen (Roche, ref. 10901393001) and 50 μl of NaAc 3 M pH 5. 2. Mix. - Add 1 ml 100 % ethanol (- 20 °C), and mix by inverting 10 times the tubes. - Precipitate DNA 1 h at - 20 °C (or overnight at 4 °C). - Centrifuge 15 min at 4 °C, 13000 rpm. The DNA-glycogen pellet should be visible {{at the bottom of the}} tube. - Collect and <b>discard</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant.</b> Centrifuge again for 30 s and discard the last drop of liquid. - Wash the DNA-glycogen pellet with 500 μl of 70 % ethanol.

Successful lung cancer therapies in patients require preliminary investigations of promising therapeutic reagents in animal models. This protocol describes a method to induce lung tumours in mice and to deliver an immunoregulatory molecule directly to the lung by intranasal application. Here we describe the usage of murine cell lines L 1 C 2 and B 16 F 10 for the induction of lung adenocarcinoma or metastatic melanoma respectively. In this model the tumour cells are injected intravenously in the tail vein of the mice. To apply therapeutic reagents locally in the lung during tumour growth, the mice are anaesthetized and the therapeutic molecule is applied drop by drop into the nose of the mouse at different time points after tumour induction. To monitor the outcome of the therapy tumour size can be defined by analyzing Haematoxilin/Eosin stained slices of the lung. ### Introduction Advancements in novel therapies for lung cancer in patients require an understanding and monitoring of the immune response mechanisms in humans as well as improvements of the experimental model of the disease. To investigate the immune responses in lung cancer, mouse models are a helpful tool. In our laboratory we standardized a method to induce lung cancer and to apply therapeutic molecules to the lungs of mice. The technique of lung tumour induction facilitates the analysis of the effects of different therapeutical molecules in the anti-tumour immune response. Here we show two models of lung tumours, the B 16 -F 10 metastatic melanoma model and the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma model. Previous studies have been performed in our group both in wild type and in knockout mice in the melanoma model (1) as well as in the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma model (2). Tumour development can be analyzed at different stages after intravenous tumour cell injection. It can be evaluated by quantifying the lung areas which are invaded with tumour cells on the lung surface as well as by analyzing lung sections stained with Haematoxilin/Eosin. Our laboratory showed that intranasal application of particular neutralizing antibodies as well as other biological active molecules ensures a localized effect in the lung (3 - 5). Using this protocol we repeatedly achieved a reduction of lung tumour growth in the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma mouse model after intranasal application of a neutralizing anti-IL 17 A antibody (6). In contrast to other methods like intraperitoneal or intravenous injection of therapeutical molecules, the intranasal protocol provides the possibility to deliver the therapy directly to the affected lung. ### Reagents **Tumour cell induction** 1.

T 48402) and t-Amyl-Alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich; cat. no. 152463) ### Equipment **Tumour cell induction** 1. CO 2 incubator (5 % CO 2, 37 °C) - centrifuge - pipets with disposable tips - pipettor - single-use plastic pipets (Greiner Bio-One) - cell culture flasks 25 cm 2, 75 cm 2, 175 cm 2 (Greiner Bio-One; cat no 690170, 658175, 661175) - 50 ml conic tubes (Greiner Bio-One) - syringes (B Braun; cat. no. 9161502) - injection chamber (Föhr medical instruments; Broome HAR- 52 - 04) - Neubauer chamber-improved (Marienfeld-Superior; cat. no. 0640010) - Erlenmeyer flask - light microscope (Axio Observer.

We suggest using 2 × 10 e 5 tumour cells per mouse for intravenous injection in the tail vein. The experimental procedure takes approximately 21 days. In case of using other mouse strains than wild type mice, the number of cells for injection and the time duration of the experiment needs to be tested and established first. Intranasal application of antibodies can be performed at different time points as well as in different dosages after tumour cell injection. The amount of antibody depends on the amount of protein you intend to neutralize in the lung. The data sheet of the antibody or previous publications might give a hint. As a possible control animals can be treated with PBS or the corresponding isotype antibody instead of the specific blocking antibody. We suggest the application of the antibody at two time points after tumour cell injection (Figure 1). To analyze the tumour growth, lung tissue can be embedded in paraffin cut into 4 micrometers thick sections which will be then stained with Hemtaoxilin/Eosin (H&E;) in accordance to standardized histological laboratory protocols. Afterwards the tumour-bearing area can be analyzed. For this purpose, stained sections can be displayed on a computer monitor with a computer linked Nikon Coolscan V ED scanner using the Program SF launcher thereby determining the ratio of the area of the lung section occupied by tumour to the lung section tumour-free area. To classify the tumour type the affected areas the slide must be further analyzed with a light microscope (e. g. Zeiss Axio Observer. D 1; Axio Vision 4. 7 software) using different magnifications. **Tumour induction** REAGENT SETUP Prepare the cell culture media DMEM + 10 % FCS, + 1 % penicillin/streptomycin for B 16 F 10 cells and RPMI + 10 % FCS, + 1 % penicillin/streptomycin for L 1 C 2 cells and store it at 4 °C.

Alternatively, the tail can also be warmed using an infrared lamp. - Take up 200 µl cell suspension in the syringe. - Insert the syringe horizontally in the tail vein of the mouse and inject the cell suspension slowly (Figure 2 d). - TIMING: 30 min. **Intranasal application** REAGENT SETUP - Prepare the solution for intranasal treatment and store it on ice. For this purpose make-up the stock concentration of the antibody or of the therapeutical molecule according to the manufacturer´s protocol (often in buffer containing BSA). Dilutions of antibodies or other therapeutical molecules, to set up the working solution for intranasal delivery, should be done with sterofundin or NaCl. Antibody-working solutions can be stored at - 20 °C for a few weeks. CAUTION! The volume for intranasal application should be 25 - 40 µl. - Prepare the anaesthetic - A) isoflurane ready to use solution - B) avertin - b 1. Dissolve 1 g 2, 2, 2 -Tribromo-Ethanol in 1 ml t-Amyl-Alcohol - b 2. Ad 39 ml PBS and vortex until total dissolving - b 3. Store the solution protected from light at 4 °C - C) ketamin (12 mg/ml) /xylazin (0, 08 ml/ml) in PBS, stored at 4 °C Ketamin can be stored at 4 °C for a few weeks. Avertin can be stored at 4 °C for a few days. CAUTION! All experiments should be performed according to national and institutional guidelines for animal care and use. PROCEDURE 1 Prepare the antibody suspension as described above and store it on ice. - Anaesthetize the mice. This step can be performed using options A, B or C. - A) inject 200 µl avertin intraperitonally (i. p) into the mice or - B) inject 60 - 70 µl ketamin i. p or - C) use the isoflurane system - c 1. prepare the isoflurane-equipment according to the manufacturer´s instructions - c 2. put the mice in the plastic chamber and anaesthetize the mice by flooding the box with isolflurane/oxygen CAUTION! Increase the doses of isoflurane slowly - By the time the mouse is immobilized and the heart beat is getting slower, clamp the mouse in the neck and tilt the head back. Pipet the solution carefully, drop-wise into the nose of the mouse, so that the mouse inhales the solution. - Wait until the mouse wakes up. After Avertin and Ketamin treatment the mouse needs approximately 30 min to get awake. Anaesthesia duration after isoflurane treatment is about 5 min. Use an infrared lamp to warm the mouse until it is awake. - CAUTION! If you use ketamin or avertin for anaesthesia wait 24 h to anaesthetize the mice again. Repeated use might be harmful for the mouse. - TIMING: 10 - 15 min. ### Anticipated Results **Tumor induction** Tumour cells (Figure 2 a, b) which are intravenously injected in the mouse tail vein (Figure 2 d) reach the lung and begin to grow. They form colonies and expand. The lung surface is afflicted by tumour cell colonies which can differ in size and number. In case of the B 16 -F 10 metastatic melanoma model the cell colonies can be recognized as black areas on the lung surface (Figure 3 a). Usually the whole lung surface is affected at day 28 - 33 after tumour cell injection with B 16 -F 10 cells causing the death of the mice (1). In case of the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma model 10 - 20 % of the lung area is occupied by the tumour 21 days after tumour cell injection. In addition to the tumour in the lung, L 1 C 2 -treated mice often develop metastases in the thorax. On H&E; stained slices the growing colonizing tumour cells are observable as high dense, purple, round regions (Figure 3 b, c) **Intranasal application** Intranasal application of antibodies allows the evaluation of new experimental therapeutical strategies for the local treatment of lung diseases such as lung cancer. The antibody can directly target cells or proteins in the lung, without covering long distances as after intraperitoneal or intravenous applications. The antibody reaches the nasal cavity as the mouse inhales the solution drop-wise (Figure 4). Using the isoflurane system anaesthesia only lasts for few minutes. ### References 1. Sauer, K. A. et al.

In this protocol we describe a co-culture system where primary simian hepatocyte could be maintained {{for a month or}} more through co-cultivation with an immortalised liver derived cell line, Hepa-RG. The hepatocytes can be infected with Plasmodium sporozoites and the persisting hypnozoites can then observed and investigated. ### Introduction Infection by malaria is initiated by the deposition of sporozoites in the skin from the salivary of an infected Anopheles mosquito during its blood meal. These sporozoites then {{make their way to the}} liver where they immediately develop in hepatocytes to produce the merozoite forms that invade red blood cells, thus staring the cycle of multiplication that causes disease and allows transmission to mosquitos. In a few of the parasite species that infect primates, the development of some of the hepatic parasites is arrested early after invasion, to resume only months or years later (1 - 3). During this time these quiescent parasites are insusceptible to all anti-malarial drugs except for primaquine. The activation of these dormant forms, known as hypnozoites, causes a relapse episode thereby increasing the morbidity of the infection and its potential to transmit. In humans, two species Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale are capable of forming hypnozoites, and this considerably hampers efforts to control and eventually eliminate them. Searching for drugs active against hypnozoites suitable for mass deployment is a urgent requirement because primaquine administration can lead to potentially severe haemolysis in persons with glucose- 6 -phosphate deficiency, a genetic trait common in populations living the areas endemic for vivax and ovale malaria. At present, screening for hypnozoitocidal activity can only be done one experimentally infected hosts, which must be followed for many months after drug administration. Since the 1950 ’s, the P. cynomolgi-infected rhesus monkey, an excellent model for P. vivax, has been used to test for efficacy (4). Given the costs and ethical limitations inherent to research on primates, screening is restricted to very few compounds indeed. Moreover, there is very little known about the biological processes associated with quiescence and activation of hypnozoites that could help narrow down the molecules to test. Clearly, in vitro cultivation of hypnozoites would make it possible to envisage more efficient and cost-effective screening strategies. We had previously demonstrated that hypnozoite-like forms could be obtained in cultured primary simian hepatocytes infected with P. cynomolgi sporozoites (5). However confirmation that these were indeed hypnozoites, and optimal use for screening assays, were hampered by the characteristic short durations (10 - 14 days at most) of primary hepatocyte cultures. Here we describe protocols in which the co-culture of simian primary hepatocytes with a HepaRG cell line allows to maintain the cultures for about a month, during which hypnozoites resulting from an initial infection with P. cynomolgi sporozoites can be enriched and observed to activate and develop into mature forms. It is likely that these protocols would also be suitable for the cultivation of P. vivax hypnozoites in human primary hepatocytes. ### Materials 1.

Pipette 100 µL of Matrigel using a cold tip and gently overlay the cells in each well - When Matrigel covers all the wells, return the plate to the incubator for 30 minutes to allow the Matrigel to gel. - Add 300 µL of culture medium to each well and replace the plate in the incubator - Every 48 hours, carefully aspirate the medium, taking care to not disturb the Matrigel, and replace it with 300 µL of fresh culture medium **Treatment with Atovaquone to eliminate schizonts** 1. At day 5 post-infection, fix 3 wells for parasite immunostaining (see “Fixation and parasite immunostaining”) so as to evaluate the proportion of schizonts versus hypnozoites - Prepare sufficient atovaquone solution for 3 days of treatment (300 µL per well per day) - a.

Remove the medium and the Matrigel by aspiration - Add 200 µL of 4 % PFA to each well to fix the cells by incubation at RT for 15 minutes - Rinse 3 times with 300 µL of PBS - Add 200 µL of 0. 1 % Triton X 100 and incubate at RT for 10 minutes - Rinse 3 times with 300 µL of PBS - To each well add 150 µL of mouse polyclonal serum raised against PfHSP 70 (1 / 2, 000 dilution), or alternatively use other suitable antibodies at the appropriate dilution, or stain with Giemsa 9 - Incubate for 45 minutes at 37 °C - Rinse 3 times with 300 µL of PBS - To each well add 150 µL of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) diluted 1 / 600 - Incubate for 45 minutes at 37 °C - Rinse 3 times with 300 µL of PBS - Enumerate the parasites under a fluorescence microscope at a 200 X magnification **Critical steps** - The homogeneity of cell plating is of the most importance. - Mosquito dissection should be performed as cleanly as possible. The use of highly infected mosquitoes (> 20 000 sporozoites per mosquito) is advisable in order to minimize bacterial and fungal contamination. Prior training on uninfected mosquitoes is highly recommended. - Efficient removal of mosquito debris during the washing steps prior to adding Matrigel. This can be achieved most optimally by using a Percoll (10) or an Accudenz (11) cushion to purify the sporozoites. - Keep Matrigel on ice to avoid untimely polymerization. - Infected co-cultured cells: avoid shaking that might perturb the cells during handling, and changes to the temperature the cultures during medium addition. - Good fixation relies on a total removal of Matrigel. ### Timing - Preparation of co-cultured cells requires around 2 hours. - The full procedure, including counting, for sporozoite isolation from 100 mosquitoes generally necessitates 2 hours when 2 trained technicians carry out the dissection. - Infection of the co-cultures requires one hour followed by an additional 3 - 4 hours for the co-incubation of cells and sporozoites. - Matrigel cover requires 1. 5 h including the incubation step (for one 48 wells culture plate) ### Troubleshooting - Hepatocyte density: hepatocytes need to be highly confluent in order to thrive, particularly for long-term cultures (hepatocyte differentiation relies in large part on establishing good intercellular junctions). It is advisable to determine the optimal cell density for seeding on the plates selected for the cultivation. - Should the viability of the hepatocytes be lower than 90 %, it might be more difficult to reach adequate hepatocyte density. In order to eliminate dead cells (thus increasing the proportion viable) one can add a Percoll purification step prior to plating: re-suspend the hepatocyte suspension in 10 ml column of 40 % iso-osmotic Percoll, and then centrifuge at 900 x g for 3 min at RT without brake; remove the supernatant and the interphase containing dead cells; suspend the pellet of viable hepatocytes in 20 ml culture medium and centrifuge again at 200 x g for 1 min at RT; <b>discard</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> and suspend the cells in a known volume of culture medium; enumerate the cells and determine the proportion viable (Trypan blue dye exclusion) using a haemocytometer; adjust density to 0. 8 million of viable cells per mL. - Contamination of the cultures is often due to inadequate care (sloppy sterile technique) during mosquito dissection or mosquito contamination during breeding. - The wounding due to the cell traversal activity of sporozoites can lead to a degradation of the cell layer in the co-cultures. The effect should be minor when 100, 000 sporozoites or less are used to infect each well. ### Anticipated Results - Following the 3 -day atovaquone treatment (usually Day 8 post-infection), the number of maturing hepatic schizonts should diminish by > 80 %, and the number of hypnozoites should be similar to that in the untreated wells - One week after atovaquone treatment (usually Day 15 post-infection), a proportion of the hypnozoites should have activated to resume development, and consequently the number of hepatic schizonts observed should mirror the decrease in the number of hypnozoites - In the absence of a Matrigel layer, merosomes should be detectable in the culture medium from D 8 post-infection in co-cultures not treated with atovaquone, or from Day 16 post-infection onward in atovaquone-treated co-culture (8 days after the end of treatment) ### References 1.

Hildebrandt ### Abstract Pre-determining fetal sex {{is against}} the random, equal {{opportunity}} both conceptus sexes have by nature. Yet, under {{a wide variety of}} circumstances, populations shift their birth sex ratio from the expected unity. The prevailing assumption has been that males produce approximately equal numbers of X and Y chromosome bearing spermatozoa in large quantities and that they have no say in this regard. However, males {{seem to be able to}} manipulate the sex ratio of their ejaculates. Here we describe a protocol for fluorescence in situ hybridisation that can help evaluate the ratio between spermatozoa carrying either of the two sex chromosomes in the ejaculate, and determine the male’s contribution to the sexual conflict. We also discuss the benefits and shortcomings of the technique. The protocol can be completed within 31 h, 20 of which are hybridisation time. Although this protocol has been devised for the pygmy hippopotamus (*Choeropsis liberiensis*), with minor modifications and a change of probes it can be adapted to other species as well. ### Introduction The endangered pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis), an endemic species to freshwater systems and forests of West Africa in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Ivory Coast and Liberia, resembles the common hippopotamus but is much smaller in size. It is a long-lived, solitary species where the sexes only meet for mating and where males defend territories, sometimes in fierce fights with competing males, which may have fatal consequences (1). While little is known about their reproduction in the wild, the captive population reproduces well. In the captive population, offspring sex ratio is shifted towards an excess of females – at birth only 42. 5 % of offspring were reported to be males (2). The cause of this shift and the mechanism by which it is achieved are unknown. Noting the difference between the sexes in terms of investment in offspring and the benefits gained thereby, it has been assumed that owing to its usually much larger investment, the female has considerably more to win or lose and if mechanisms to bias offspring sex ratios do exist, they would be operated by the female (3). Hence, both empirical and theoretical work has traditionally concentrated on the female and dismissed any potential paternal contribution as minor and irrelevant. There is only a very limited body of literature that has actually evaluated the contribution of males to the determination of offspring sex. Most available studies, conducted on samples from domestic boar (4), domestic cattle (4 - 8) or humans (9 - 11), used inaccurate evaluation techniques such as fluorescence staining of the F-body or PCR amplification on pooled semen samples. A positive correlation between the ratio in the ejaculate and the birth sex ratio was found in those few studies which evaluated both parameters (6, 10, 11). The few studies that were based on the more accurate fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) evaluation technique (12 - 14) either suffered from a considerably smaller sample size compared to their control (176 samples compared to the pooled national data on birth sex ratio from several European countries and the USA) and counted too few cells to detect a deviation from an even sex ratio (only 200 cells per ejaculate) (12), dealt with samples obtained from infertile patients (where actually an excess of X-chromosome bearing spermatozoa was detected) (13), or had insufficient statistical power and a sample size too small to detect significant deviation from unity (N = 7 compared with N = 12) (14). Here we describe here a detailed protocol for determining the ratio between the X- and Y-chromosome bearing spermatozoa in the ejaculates of the pygmy hippopotamus. ### Reagents 1.

Sperm sample washing and slide preparation** **Before starting** 1. Prepare fresh Carnoy’s fixative and put in the freezer (at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC) for at least 2 - 3 hours. Keep the fixative in the freezer throughout the handling of the sample. **Procedure**: 1. Centrifuge native sperm sample of (ideally) 200 × 10 e 6 spermatozoa at 400 g for 10 min and <b>discard</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant.</b> - Add 8 mL of Carnoy’s fixative, re-suspend the pellet by vortex and then centrifuge at 400 g for 10 minutes. If there is a smaller number of cells (50 to 100 × 106) then use only 4 mL of Carnoy’s fixative. - Remove supernatant, suspend again in fixative and centrifuge. Repeat these washing steps 3 - 4 times (or more). - Keep sperm in fixative in the freezer (at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC) until used for slides. Prepare slides on the day the FISH is being done. - Prepare the slides – make sure they are clean and properly marked on the frosted end. - Vortex the sample before use. - With a disposable plastic pipette drop (from about 10 cm above the slide) one drop of suspended semen on each slide and air-dry them horizontally. - Mark the area of the drop on the backside of the slide with diamond pen. **B. Slide treatment (bloating, aging, denaturation, hybridization) ** **Before starting** 1. Thaw one 2 -mL Eppendorf of 0. 1 M Tris solution and one 20 -µL tube of DTT solution for every 4 - 5 slides. - Thaw 100 µL of 70 % formamid solution for each slide. - Put about 120 mL of 2 × SSC solution in a Coplin jar at room temperature. - Put about 120 mL of distilled water inside a Coplin jar in the refrigerator at 4 ºC. - Thaw hybridisation mix. For each slide mix about 4 μL of hybridisation mix with 0. 5 µL of each of the X and Y chromosome-specific probes. Make sure to vortex the probes before taking the needed volume. Keep in ice in the dark or in the freezer (at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC) until just before use. Vortex before use. **Procedure**: 1. Mix well the DTT with the 0. 1 M Tris solution (one Eppendorf of each), resulting in 10 mM DTT solution. Make sure to take all the DTT by washing the DTT tube several times with 0. 1 M Tris solution taken from the other tube. - Put 0. 4 to 0. 5 mL of the 10 mM DTT solution on each slide, spread it evenly, cover with parafilm and leave at room temperature for 15 min. - Remove parafilm, discard access of liquid and then wash for 2 min in 2 × SSC solution at room temperature. - Air dry the slides. - Put 100 µL of 70 % formamid solution on each slide, cover with large (24 × 50 mm) cover slip while making sure the liquid spreads all over the slide (with no air bubbles). - Pre-heat the ThermoBrite to 80 ºC, load the slides and incubate for 10 min. If do not fill all slots on the ThermoBrite with samples then put empty slides in the empty slots. - Remove the slides from the ThermoBrite, remove the cover slips, discard of excess liquids and then wash in the cold distilled water for two minutes. - Air dry the slides. - Dehydrate the slides in the ethanol solutions – 1 min in each concentration going from 70 % to 90 % to 100 % and then air-dry the slides. Make sure the slides are absolutely dry before going to next step!! - Put on each 20 × 20 mm cover slip, at its center, 5 μL of probes with hybridization mix. Put the slide over the cover slip (face down) so the marked area aligns with the cover slip and let it stand for about one minute to let the hybridization and probes mix spread evenly. Make sure the entire area is covered and that no air bubbles are left. If needed, apply light pressure to spread the mix all the way to the edges of the cover slip. - Seal around with rubber cement. - Put in the ThermoBrite with some distilled water for humidity and run the following program: 10 minutes at 65 ºC for denaturation and then at 37 ºC over night for hybridization. **C. Washing and counter staining** **Before starting** 1. Heat water bath to 75 ºC and put 120 mL of 0. 4 × SSC solution in a Coplin jar in it for at least two hours. - Put 120 mL of 2 × SSC / 0. 1 % NP- 40 solution in a Coplin jar at room temperature. **Procedure**: 1. Remove rubber cement and cover slip. - Put for 1 minute in 0. 4 SSC at 75 ºC. - Drip excess solution and then put for 1 min in 2 × SSC / 0. 1 % NP- 40 at room temperature. - Air dry the slides in the dark. - Put a drop of DAPI with antifade (about 22 µL per slide) and cover with a 24 × 32 mm cover slip. - If intended for prolonged storage, seal around the edges of the cover slip with nail polish and then air dry it. Slides should be stored in the freezer (at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC). - View under fluorescence microscope at × 100 magnification with oil. The microscope should have a three-way filter – One for DAPI (blue), one for Cy 3 (red) and one for FITC (green). - IF successful, all cells will be stained blue, X-chromosome bearing spermatozoa should have red/pink spot on them and Y-chromosome bearing spermatozoa should have a green/yellow spot on them. ### Timing Entire procedure takes, from start to finish, about 30 - 31 hours. This is broken into the three stages as follow: **A. Sperm sample washing and slide preparation** 1. Carnoy’s fixative preparation and cooling: 3 h. - Sample washing: 1 h. - Slide preparation: 1 h. **B. Slide treatment (bloating, aging, denaturation, hybridisation) ** 1. Bloating and aging: 2 h - Denaturation and hybridisation: At least 20 h (longer hybridisation can result in a stronger and clearer signal). **C. Washing and counter staining** 1. Heating the 0. 4 × SSC solution: 2. 5 hours. - Washing and counter staining: 1 hour. Preparation of the Carnoy’s fixative, its cooling and sample washing in stage A can be done separately from all the rest. Washed samples in the fixative can be stored at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC for months to years. A longer hybridisation time is likely to extend the duration of the entire procedure. ### Troubleshooting 1. Signal too weak: extend hybridisation time or increase the volume of hybridisation mix and probes. - Cells have disintegrated: reduce the time of incubation with DTT solution. - Cells have not bloated enough: increase incubation time with DTT solution. - Difficult to find cells on the slide: concentrate the sample by centrifugation and re-suspension in smaller volume of fixative. - Cells overlap or in big aggregates: further dilute the sample, vortex well and prepare new slides. - In general, if the end sample does not give acceptable results, it would be a good idea to view the slide after each stage up to the denaturation and hybridisation stage (i. e. after slide preparation, after DTT treatment, and after formamid treatment). ### Anticipated Results Assuming the procedure worked well, all spermatozoa will be stained in blue, those carrying the X-chromosome will have a red/pink spot and those carrying the Y-chromosome will have a green/yellow spot (Figure 1). In some cases, depending on the individual, there may be very small proportion of cells carrying both sex chromosomes and thus will have clear spots of both colours. In some cells hybridisation will not take place and there will be no spot in them. The probes may become slightly contaminated during their preparation and would thus give, in addition to the main larger spots, also one or more small spots of one or of both colours in some of the cells. ### References 1.

These methods allow probing physical proximities between chromatin elements without specifically identifying the protein components that mediate such interactions. Here we describe a detailed protocol for Combined 3 C-ChIP-Cloning (6 C) technology, which combines multiple techniques to identify the proteins that bridge distant genomic regions, while simultaneously identifying such physical proximities. This method is also useful for determining if a candidate protein might mediate long-range interactions, both in cis and in trans in the nucleus. We discuss how the 6 C technique can be incorporated with other techniques to discover all the chromatin regions in the nucleus that interact with a given gene or chromatin region of interest in a specific protein-dependent manner. Such information allows complete, cell-type-specific mapping of all the chromatin interactions mediated by specific proteins. The 6 C assay advances {{our understanding of the}} three-dimensional aspects of the higher-order folding of chromatin and provides an important tool to examine the role of specific proteins in nuclear organization. In addition to providing a detailed protocol of the 6 C technique, we discuss how this technology can be used by investigators working in the area of chromatin biology, with special interest in chromatin long-range interactions. ### RELATED INFORMATION The 6 C assay combines three different methodologies: chromosome conformation capture (3 C) (Dekker et al. 2002), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and cloning (Fig. 1). The first step involves conventional 3 C methodology: The chromatin is cross-linked, digested with restriction enzymes, and ligated under conditions that favor intramolecular ligation. Immediately after ligation, the chromatin is immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the protein of interest (i. e., the suspected “bridging protein” or the protein whose mediating physical proximities the investigator wishes to map). Thereafter, the cross-links are reversed, and the DNA is purified further. The fragments obtained are then cloned into a vector harboring the same restriction enzyme site overhangs that were generated in the enzyme digestion step of the 3 C portion of the protocol. The clones are further screened by digestion with the same restriction enzyme. Ideally, clones showing multiple inserts will result from the intramolecular ligation and should represent physical proximities involving the protein targeted in the immunoprecipitation steps. These clones are chosen for sequencing to reveal the identity of the partners. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1. ** Summary of the Combined 3 C-ChIP-Cloning (6 C) method.

It also determines the resolution of interaction maps that can be obtained using the 6 C assay in terms of defining the exact chromatin elements that are involved in physical pairing. Enzymes that produce cohesive ends from palindromic recognition sites are preferred in 3 C assays, and the six-cutters such as EcoRI, HindIII, and BglII are commonly used. These should cut every 4 kb along the genomic DNA and offer a good starting point. To obtain higher-resolution maps, frequent cutters such as MseI (predicted to cut every 256 bp) can be used.

Transfer 200 μL of the supernatant to a new 1. 5 -mL tube. 37. Thaw the inputs (from Step 22). Add 190 μL of bead eluting buffer. 38. Reverse-cross-link samples (from Step 36) and inputs (from Step 37) overnight at 65 °C. - *Cover the tubes in the heat block with aluminum foil to reduce evaporation*. 39.

Using standard cloning protocols, clone the 3 C-ChIP products (from Step 44) into a vector that has enzyme overhangs similar to those generated in the 3 C assay. - *This step typically involves cloning an “IgG/no antibody 3 C-ChIP product” and “Plus antibody 3 C-ChIP product,” in addition to regular cloning controls*. 47. Use the ligated vector to transform high-efficiency competent bacterial cells. 48. For experimental samples, spread the surface of LB-agar plates containing the antibiotic of choice (i. e., LB-ampicillin or LB-kanamycin agar plates), with 45 μL of X-gal and 9 μL of IPTG per 100 -mm dish before plating the transformed cells. 49. The next day, count the number of blue and white colonies in the bacterial plates from samples immunoprecipitated with the specific antibody as well as the controls (i. e., no antibody or IgG). - *White colonies represent bacteria-harboring plasmids with inserts, whereas blue colonies represent bacteria with plasmids without the insert. In an ideal 6 C experiment, the number of white colonies should be several-fold higher in samples immunoprecipitated with the specific antibody than in controls. This indicates that the pull-down with a specific antibody enriched specific protein-occupied genomic regions*. 50. Pick several white colonies (i. e., containing the insert) from the bacterial plates. 51. Use each such colony to inoculate LB liquid medium containing the appropriate antibiotic. Incubate in a shaking incubator at 220 rpm overnight at 37 °C. **Plasmid Purification** 52. Purify the plasmids using the PureLink HQ 96 Mini Plasmid DNA Purification Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. - *Alternatively, standard plasmid preparation protocols or kits can also be used*. **Screening for Ligated Partners** 53. Screen the purified plasmids (from Step 52) by digestion with the same restriction enzyme used for Step 16, using standard restriction digestion protocols. 54. Separate the resulting DNA fragments by electrophoresis in a 1 % agarose gel containing SYBR Safe. Use an appropriately sized DNA ladder for reference. Visualize using UV light. *See Troubleshooting*. 55. Sequence the plasmids showing more than one insert. - *Ideally, multiple inserts mean interacting partners*. 56. Sequence the inserts using primers from two different ends of the vector (e. g., T 3 and T 7 promoter-specific primers for pBluescript II RI Predigested Vector). ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The fragments are too big, and/or there are more than two inserts in the plasmids. **[Step 54]** - **Solution**: Subclone the fragments into a new restriction enzyme-digested vector before proceeding with sequencing. ### DISCUSSION The 6 C-captured interactions should be validated by performing independent 3 C assays (Tolhuis et al. 2002), in which one performs 3 C-PCRs using multiple primer combinations from two different remote sequences. The primers for this purpose are designed exactly as described by Splinter et al. (2004). It also is important to establish, by using separate assays, that the interacting regions captured in the 6 C assay are truly occupied by the protein of interest in cells. To this end, perform ChIP assays (Tiwari et al. 2008) using antibodies specific for the protein of interest. The immunoprecipitated DNA can then be amplified using primers spanning the restriction enzyme site found to be involved in the 3 C ligation with other partner(s) in each of the 6 C clones. In early attempts of the 6 C assay (Tiwari et al. 2008), screening the clones by restriction digestion identified a very low frequency of clones having multiple inserts (five out of 352). A number of reasons could account for this. First, the rest of the clones that had a single insert probably represented distinct genomic sites that were bound by the specific protein (in this case, EZH 2) but were not engaged in any long-range associations. Interestingly, this might also reflect the frequency with which certain protein-dependent long-range associations take place in the nucleus. Second, the number of clones with multiple inserts might also be reduced because of difficulty in cloning (i. e., ligation and transformation) or sequencing of large fragments resulting from the ligation fragments generated by a six-cutter restriction enzyme (e. g., EcoRI). Third, intramolecular ligation after cross-linking and digestion will lead to a fraction of the DNA occurring as circular DNA that cannot be cloned; this might further reduce the number of clones in such an assay. Finally, the study could also have missed some interactions involving partners that bear DNA methylation at the EcoRI site (EcoRI is a DNA methylation-sensitive enzyme). Future work should develop strategies to tackle each of these issues to improve the overall efficiency of the method. The 6 C technique can be combined with other recently published techniques to discover all the chromatin regions in the nucleus that are brought in close physical proximity to the gene (or any other chromatin region of interest) in a specific protein-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Following immunoprecipitation with the antibody of interest, the samples can be subjected to 4 C analysis (Zhao et al. 2006) or reverse-cross-linked, purified, digested with a four-cutter enzyme of choice, and processed further for either 3 C-chip (Simonis et al. 2006) or the ACT assay (Ling et al. 2006). The 6 C procedure can also be used to reveal whether two known chromatin regions are brought into close physical proximity by a specific protein by following the amplification criteria used in the original 3 C assay, subsequent to the reversal of cross-linking and purification (Dekker et al. 2002). ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2 **.

These forces can be transmitted to the cell through the cytoskeletal filament network, inducing different biochemical responses within the cytoplasm. Although there have been ample reports showing that cytoplasmic enzymes can be directly activated by a local stress on the cell surface via integrins, there has been no evidence that mechanical forces can directly alter nuclear functions without intermediate biochemical cascades. Recently, we showed evidence that forces on the cell membrane can be transmitted directly into the nucleus, inducing structural changes of protein complexes in Cajal bodies. Here, we describe a protocol that utilizes the optical magnetic twisting cytometry (MTC) for force application and fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) to monitor the dynamics and interaction of various Cajal body proteins. ### Introduction It is well known that human bodies are constantly under the influence of mechanical forces. These mechanical forces influence the growth of tissues and organs. Cells integrate both chemical and mechanical cues to regulate biological processes as diverse as differentiation, vascular development, tumor growth and malignancy (1 - 5). However, little is known about the mechanism by which individual cells sense the mechanical forces and convert them in to biochemical signals within the cell and influence the gene expression, a process known as mechanotransduction. Advances in the field of mechanotransduction have demonstrated that focal adhesion complex proteins such as spectrin (6), talin (7), and integrin (8) can be deformed, unfolded, and thus activated by forces of physiologic magnitudes. Proteins and enzymes within the cytoplasm can be rapidly activated and phosphorylated upon mechanical stress (9, 10). Stem cells differentiate in respond to different surface topology (11), substrate rigidity (12), and applied stress (13), a clear indication of gene expression change within the nucleus. Nonetheless, direct force-altered protein localization/activity and thus gene expression within the nucleus remains elusive. Immunoblotting and immunostaining have been used to study mechanotransduction (14), but these techniques do not provide sufficient resolution and real time results in a single living cell. Because gene expression in a live cell involves many complicated processes in the cytoplasm and the nucleus and takes time, it is impossible, at the present time, to attribute any changes in gene expression to direct effects of the applied force at the cell surface, without involving intermediate biochemical signaling cascades. Therefore, we asked if localizations of protein complexes in the nucleus can be directly altered by a local surface force, since there is evidence that interactions among nuclear proteins are critical in regulating gene expression. We employed a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) based technique to monitor the dynamics and interaction of proteins within the Cajal Body (CB) complex in response to mechanical stress (15). CBs are critical for the biogenesis and recycling of several classes of small ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes involved in pre-mRNA splicing and preribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) processing (16, 17), and assembly and delivery of telomerase to telomeres (16 - 19). Recent advances in the dynamics, assembly, and function of CBs suggest that the CBs organize as a direct reflection of highly active genes with which they are physiologically associated (20). Intermolecular FRET can be used to visualize protein-protein interactions. In this protocol, we labeled various CB proteins with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The CFP labeled protein acts as the donor while the YFP labeled protein act as the receptor. Only CFP is excited during the experiment while both CFP and YFP were monitored simultaneously. By observing the relative intensity changes of CFP and YFP, we can then quantify the distance and interaction between CB proteins. When the CFP and YFP labeled proteins are close to each another (< 10 nm), FRET occurs when the emission of CFP is transferred to excite YFP. As we observe the FRET ratio of CFP/YFP, there will be a decrease in FRET ratio when the two proteins come closer to each other, because there is a decrease in CFP intensity and an increase in YFP intensity (anti-correlation). On the other hand, when the two proteins are separated and thus there is an increase in distance between the two proteins, the ratio of CFP/YFP will increase. Here, we outline the use of magnetic twisting cytometry (MTC) 21 in detail to study the spatial and temporal mechano-chemical response within the cell nucleus. We also describe the use of a dynamic sinusoidal load to quantify the viscoelastic and dissipative behavior between protein pairs within the CB. Our results showed that mechanical force at the apical membrane can be directly transmitted through the actin microfilaments and nuclear envelope to remote cites within the nucleus. The stress induced protein dissociation was rapid and did not require intermediate biochemical signaling, diffusion, or translocation. ### Reagents 1.

Suspend the magnetic beads stock in 95 % alcohol (for sterilization) and aliquot them into small 2 ml vial each containing 1 mg of beads. - Leave a vial open and evaporate the alcohol out. - Add 1. 5 ml of PBS buffer to rinse the beads. Centrifuge it down and discard the PBS carefully. - Add 1 ml of Cabonate buffer to the beads. - Add 50 μg of RGD peptides (diluted in DMSO) to the bead-buffer solution. - Rotate the beads at 4 OC overnight. - Before using beads, centrifuge the beads and <b>discard</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> RGD. Then rinse it once with PBS as described in step 3. - Store the coated beads in serum free DMEM. **Cell culture and transfection** 1. All cells used for experiments are preferred low passages. - Regular cells culture was done in T- 25 flask and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-Glutamine at 37 oC in 5 % CO 2. - For experiments, cells need to be prepared 3 days in advance. Day 1, coat the 35 mm glass bottom dishes with Collagen-I and store at 4 oC to allow absorption of collagen on to the glass surface. - Day 2, sterilize the collagen-coated culture dish by leaving it under UV light for 10 minutes. Then seed (~ 300, 000) cells in the collagen-coated 35 -mm glass bottom dish such that it is ~ 80 % confluent the following day. - Day 3, double transfect the cells with plasmid constructs of CFP and YFP labeled proteins. Dilute 1 μg of CFP plasmid and 1 μg of YFP plasmid to 100 μg of Opti-MEM I medium in a small vial. - In another vial, add 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 to 100 μg of Opti-MEM I medium in a small vial. - Wait 5 minutes in room temperature before mixing the contents of both vials together. Then wait another 20 minutes. - Add the total ~ 200 μl of DNA-Lipofectamine mixture to the dish containing cells. - Optional: To minimize photobleaching, 0. 05 mM Trolox solution was added to the dish along with the DNA-Lipofectamine mixture (22). - Incubate for 6 hours at 37 oC in 5 % CO 2 before replacing the culture medium with regular DMEM culture medium. - Day 4, cells are transfected and ready for imaging. **Magnetic Twisting Cytometry (MTC) ** 1. On the day of the experiment (day 4 in t in the previous section), take the dish out of the incubator and remove most of the culture medium, such that only the cells in the center well (glass region) is slightly covered in medium. - Add 20 μl of RGD-coated magnetic beads (~ 20 μg of beads) to the center well of the dish by scattering them all over. - Carefully place the beads back into the incubator and leave for 10 minutes to allow for integrin clustering and formation of focal adhesions surrounding the beads. - Remove cells from incubator and rinse it once with PBS. Avoid disturbing cells in the center well. Add and remove PBS gently by the side of the dish. - Add CO 2 -independent medium to the dish. This is to maintain the pH of the cell culture when it is exposed to the open while under the microscope. - Place the dish in the MTC stage where coils are located. Then place it on the inverted microscope. - Find a single cell that is well transfected with both CFP and YFP plasmids. The cell also needs to have a single bead attached to it. Exclude all cells that are not well transfected, have more than one bead attached, or are in contact with neighboring cells. - After the good cell is found, magnetize the magnetic beads by applying a strong magnetic pulse (~ 1000 G, < 0. 5 ms). - Now that the beads are polarized and magnetized, apply a magnetic field in the direction perpendicular to that of the magnetizing pulse. This will cause the bead to rotate. Input the parameter for MTC. Parameters of stress peak magnitude for FRET analysis are typically 17. 5 Pa (50 G step load) or other magnitudes, where for phase lag analysis is 24. 5 Pa (70 G oscillatory load). - While force is being applied, capture the necessary brightfield or fluorescence images. **FRET imaging and analysis** 1. For FRET imaging, the Dual-View imaging system was used to split the image into two (1344 × 512 pixels each). The top view filters for YFP, while the bottom view filters for CFP. Each image is 1344 × 1024 pixels and simultaneously captures both CFP and YFP activity. - While force is being applied by the MTC, FRET dual-view time course images are captured to monitor the protein-protein interaction within the nucleus before and after force. - After experiments are done and images obtained. A customized Matlab program is used to analyze the data. The program first divides the top (YFP) and bottom (CFP) image in to two separate files. - The region of interest (an individual CB in our case) is then selected. The program crops this region from the CFP and YFP images, then aligns them by cross-correlation. - A binary mask is then created for CFP and YFP images by using Matlab’s “graythresh” function. The binary mask is then multiplied with the fluorescent images generating images that have only the fluorescing region and a black background. - The CFP/YFP ratio value is then calculated for each individual pixel that has been aligned and cross-correlated. An average of the region is obtained and reported. Each image or time point will generate one CFP/YFP value. - Note: More details on the Matlab program has been described by Na S et. al. (14) **Polyacrylamide gels for traction force measurement** 1. Polyacrylamide (PA) gels with 0. 2 μm fluorescent beads embedded within are used to measure the traction force each cell generates. By varying the concentration of bis and acrylamide, different gel stiffness can be obtained. - To prepare PA gels, first smear 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane over the glass surface of a 35 mm glass-bottom-dish using a cotton-tipped swab and let it sit there for 6 min. - Wash it thoroughly with water before applying 100 μl/ dish of 0. 5 % gluteraldehyde for 30 min. - Wash again thoroughly and let them dry. Avoid touching the glass surface throughout the whole gel making procedure. - Determine the bis:acrylamide solution proportions to get the desired substrate stiffness. 0. 6, 2, and 8 kP, corresponds to 0. 06 % bisacrylamide and 3 % acrylamide, 0. 05 % bisacrylamide and 5 % acrylamide, 0. 3 % bisacrylamide and 5 % acrylamide respectively. Prepare 1 ml of each desired mixture in a small 2 ml vial. - Add 10 μl of 0. 2 μm fluorescent beads to the bis-acrylamide mixture. Before adding fluorescent beads, be sure to vortex or sonicate. - Add polymerizing activator/initiator to the beads-bis-acrylamide mixture. 10 % APS at 1 : 200 volume ratio (5 μl in this case). TEMED at 1 : 2000 volume ratio (0. 5 μl in this case). Mix everything together thoroughly. - Add 15 μl of the mixture to the glass surface of the treated dish. (15 μl would give 75 μm thick substrates) - Flatten droplet with a 12 mm circular cover glasses. - Turn the glass bottom dish upside down. This ensures the fluorescent beads to be closer to the top surface. - Place the upside down dishes in a 37 oC incubator for 30 - 45 minutes. Elevated temperature helps in the polymerization. - After the gels are fully polymerized, flood the dish with 100 mM HEPES. Then carefully remove the circular cover glass with a single edge razor. - Make 1 mM solution of SANPAH with DMSO and 100 mM HEPES. Add DMSO to SANPAH first to dissolve the solid powder, and then add it to HEPES. For example, 5 mg SANPAH+ 50 μl DMSO+ 10 ml (100 mM) HEPES. - Take out HEPES from the glass bottom dishes, dab excess HEPES with Kim wipes from around gel edge - Apply 200 μl of SANPAH solution the gel (center well of dish). - Expose surface to UV for 6 min (6 ″ away from the lamp) to photo activate the gel surface. SANPAH color will turn dark. Without SANPAH treatment, collagen will not bind to gel surface. - Rinse off SANPAH with 100 mM HEPES. - Repeat photo activation procedure once more and rinse it off with 100 mM HEPES. - Coat the gel surface with the desired concentration of collagen and incubate at 4 ° C overnight. - Before seeding cells onto the gel surface, sterilize it under UV light for 10 - 15 minutes. - PA gels can be stored in PBS at 4 ° C for three weeks. - Note: To determine the ratio of bis to acrylamide for desired substrate stiffness, refer to references (23 - 25). **Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) ** 1. Cells are cultured on the PA gels. Depending on the PA gel stiffness, the cell will generate different traction forces, and hence different magnitude of deformation. - Three images need to be captured. First is the brightfield or phase contrast image of the cell which will be used to identify the cell boundary. Second is the fluorescent beads marker image while the cell is still on the substrate. Third is the reference fluorescent beads marker image after the cell has been removed or trypsinized from the gel surface. - A customize Matlab program was used to analyze the traction force generated. The displacement field induced by each individual cell’s tractional forces was determined by comparing the fluorescent bead positions before and after trypsinization (cell-free and thus force-free). - An image correlation method where the flourecent images are divided into small window areas is used to determine the displacement vectors (26). - The root-mean-square (RMS) traction field was then calculated from the displacement field using Fourier Transform Traction Cytometry (FTTC) based on the Boussinesq solution (27). **Cell stiffness measurement** 1. The stress applied to the cell (in Pa) can be calculated from the applied twisting magnetic field (in G) by multiplying the bead constant (in Pa/G) with the applied twisting field (in G). The bead constant reflects the magnetic property of the bead and may differ from batch-to-batch. The beads are calibrated by immersing them in a known viscous fluid, and applying a constant magnetic field while measuring the remnant magnetic field (21). For example, a 50 G applies 17. 5 Pa of stress to the cell if the bead constant is 0. 35 Pa/G(9). - When a cell with a single bead bound to its apical surface is found under the microscope, an oscillatory stress of 0. 3 Hz is applied using the MTC. - The MTC software tracks the displacement coordinates of the magnetic bead and saves them in a text file. - By quantifying the magnetic bead displacement, and the bead embedded area, the cell complex modulus can be estimated. A custom Matlab program is then used to calculate the cell stiffness. - The beads whose displacement waves are synchronized to the input sinusoidal signals were selected. This is to filter out spontaneous movements of the beads or microscope stage shifts. - Beads with displacements less than 5 nm (detectable resolution) and loosely bound beads were not selected for analysis. To increase the signal to noise ratio, the peak amplitude of the displacement was averaged over 5 consecutive cycles for each cell. - The complex stiffness is calculated using the equation G*=T/d. For each bead, the elastic stiffness G’ (the real part of G*) and the dissipative stiffness G” (the imaginary part of G*) was calculated based on the phase lag. The measured stiffness has the units of torque per unit bead volume per unit bead displacement (Pa/nm). - A finite element model is then used to convert the cell stiffness (Pa/nm) to modulus (Pa) based on the bead to cell surface contact (28) (Figure. 1). ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") *Figure 1. Quantification of magnetic bead embedment in HeLa cells. An RGD-coated bead was bound to the apical surface of the cell for ~ 15 minutes before it was fixed and stained with phalloidin. Integrin-mediated focal adhesions form around the bead-cell contact area, giving rise to an actin ring. The bead embedment was estimated by measuring the actin ring diameter from the fluorescent image and comparing it to the bead diameter from the brightfield image (double arrows). Bead embedment in HeLa cells is 20 - 30 %. Scale bar = 10 μm*. 9. More details on how to calculate cell stiffness have been described by Fabry B et. al. (29). **Phase lag quantification** 1. An oscillatory stress (0. 3 Hz or 0. 83 Hz) is applied to a cell that is well transfected, similar to the stress used to measure cell stiffness - Time course images of the bead, CFP labeled protein, and YFP labeled protein are captured while the cyclic force is being applied. - A custom Matlab program is used to analyze the images and the displacement of bead, CFP and YFP labeled proteins are determined. The phase lag of fluorescent proteins to the bead is then calculated. - One complete cycle of stress corresponds to 360 o. For example, at 0. 3 Hz, the period for one complete cycle is 3. 33 s. If CFP lags behind the bead displacement by 0. 3 s, that will correspond to a phase lag of ~ 32 o. **Mean Square Displacement (MSD) ** 1. For CB dynamics, an oscillatory stress (0. 3 Hz) needs to be applied. Fluorescent images used for MSD analysis were obtained using single-view fluorescence filter. - Time course images of the bead, CFP labeled protein, and YFP labeled protein are captured before, during and after the cyclic force is being applied. - Binary images of the bead, CFP and YFP are obtained by using the “graythresh” Matlab function. The centroid coordinates of the bead and each fluorescing protein are then obtained. - The coordinates of each fluorescence particle obtained was then used to calculate the mean square displacement (MSD) of Coilin and SMN. The MSD before, during, and after mechanical loading were calculated using a customized Matlab program based (15). The same procedure is performed on bright-field images to obtain the bead MSD. ### Timing Preparation for experiments takes up to 3 days. Dishes need to be coated with collagen or other matrix proteins. Beads need to be coated with RGD or ligands to integrins. Cells need to be transfected. Depending on the transfection efficiency and how magnetic beads bind to the cell surface, locating an appropriate cell for data collection may take up sometime. The whole process of making PA gels may take a day (excluding incubation time...|$|E

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2005. ### INTRODUCTION The discovery and use of fluorescent proteins to label chromosomal proteins has yielded basic structural information as well as insights into dynamics that were previously inaccessible. This protocol describes a method for tagging specific chromosome sites using the *lac* operator/repressor system, wherein direct repeats of bacterial operator sequences are coupled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged proteins that recognize these sequences. Direct *lac* operator repeats are generated by directional cloning. Although the use of direct repeats, as opposed to inverted repeats, reduces recombination within the bacterial host at high copy number, even the direct repeats are unstable, requiring the use of special bacterial hosts and low-copy-number plasmids for cloning. The introduction of the *lac* operator repeats into eukaryotic cells uses traditional transformation methods. Techniques for the isolation of stable cell clones with varying transgene copy numbers are described in the protocol, as are several methods for visual screening {{of large numbers of}} stable cell clones to isolate rare clones containing labeled chromosomal regions with desired features. ### RELATED INFORMATION In principle, chromosome tagging can be accomplished through the use of any repetitive sequence to which a specific protein binds. The first application of this approach used the bacterial lac operator and Lac repressor combination. The lac operator/Lac repressor-labeling system has been successfully adapted for tagging chromatin in live bacteria, yeast, and mammalian tissue culture cells (Fig. 1), as well as in multicellular organisms including *Caenorhabditis elegans*, *Drosophila*, and *Arabidopsis*. Subsequent approaches have used tet operator or glucocorticoid receptor element repeats. Recently, the lac operator system has been used in combination with the bacteriophage viral replicase translational operator and several color variants of GFP to label DNA, RNA, and protein in living cells. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1. ** Examples of different stable cell lines with lac operator-tagged chromosome regions visualized by GFP-Lac repressor in vivo expression.

Dry ice - Equipment for agarose gel electrophoresis - Filter paper - Flasks (25 -cm 2 tissue culture; 75 -cm 2) - Fluorescence-activated cell sorter - Forceps (sharp-tipped) - Incubator preset to 30 °C - Inoculation loops - Marker (permanent) - Microcentrifuge - Microcentrifuge tubes (1. 5 mL) - Micropipette tips (sterile 200 -μL) (1 mL) (optional; see Step 8. viii) - Microscope - Petri dishes (150 -mm) - Pipette - Plastic hose (optional; see Step 8. viii) - Plates for growing bacterial cultures - Plates (96 -well) - Shaking platform - Tubes for transfection ### METHOD **Preparing Vector DNA Containing Large Direct Repeats** 1. Clone the lac operator repeat into a vector. - *This protocol is based on preparations from our laboratory using the pSV 2 -DHFR- 8. 32 plasmid containing a 256 -copy lac operator repeat*. - i. Use Stbl 2 competent cells grown at 30 °C to help maintain full-length lac operator repeats. - ii. Clone the lac operator repeats into low-copy-number vectors (e. g., psv 2 -DHFR- 8. 32). - *Having too many copies in a cell increases the possibility of recombination*. - Purify vector DNA as follows: - The purification of vector DNA should take no more than 3 d to complete (4 d if the optional second minipreps are performed in Step 2. viii). Recombination may occur if plates or cultures from Step 1 are allowed to stand at 4 °C; thus it is important to complete this procedure without delay. However, the plasmid DNA, once prepared from the cells, is stable. Because low-copy-number plasmids are used, expect low yields at every purification step. - i. Streak bacteria from a stab culture onto an LB plate containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL). Store the stab culture in the dark at room temperature. - ii. Incubate the inoculated LB plate for 24 h at 30 °C. - *Even after this length of time, the colonies will be small*. - iii. Inoculate at least 10 3 -mL cultures of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) with well-isolated colonies. Incubate the cultures on a shaker overnight at 30 °C. - iv. Prepare DNA using a miniprep procedure (e. g., QIAGEN) from 1. 5 mL of each culture. Store the remainder of each culture at 4 °C. - v. Digest aliquots of the DNA with SalI and XhoI. Separate the DNA fragments on an agarose gel (0. 7 %). - *At this step, it is critical to be very discerning. Any bands present other than those expected could indicate recombination of the plasmid (in the case of the pSV 2 -DHFR- 8. 32 plasmid containing a 256 -copy lac operator repeat, expect 10 -kb and 5 -kb fragments) *. - vi. Prepare and freeze a glycerol stock, or prepare a stab culture of each positive clone (from the stored cultures in Step 2. iv). - vii. Inoculate 500 mL of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) with the remaining culture from one of the positive clones. Incubate the culture overnight at 30 °C with shaking. - *It may be preferable to prepare two 500 -mL cultures, each from a different positive clone, in the event that one clone is lost during large-scale growth*. - viii. (Optional) Before proceeding with the maxiprep DNA isolation, isolate DNA from an aliquot of the 500 -mL culture by repeating Steps 2. iv- 2. v. While preparing the miniprep DNA, centrifuge the 500 -mL culture. <b>Discard</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant,</b> and freeze the bacterial pellet until ready to use. Use positive cultures for the following step: - ix. Isolate DNA from the 500 -mL culture using a maxiprep procedure. If using QIAGEN maxipreps with Qiafilters, double the volume of P 1, P 2, and P 3 added to each pellet, and then split the prep into two Qiafilters. This prevents the Qiafilter from clogging. - *The yield of DNA will be low. A good yield is ~ 125 μg of DNA per 500 -mL culture*. - x. Digest aliquots of the DNA with SalI and XhoI to confirm that only DNA fragments of the expected size are present. **Making Stable Cell Lines Containing lac Operator Repeats** 3. Grow cells for transfection for ~ 1 wk. - *CHO DG 44 cells are derivatives of CHO K 1 cells and are doubly deleted for the DHFR locus. The product of the DHFR gene is necessary for intermediary metabolism of thymidylates and purines. An imbalance of nucleotides in cells may be the cause of both insert instability due to gene amplification and an abnormal cell cycle due to interference with replication timing*. 4. Purify plasmid DNA for transfection as follows: - i. Transfer 300 μL of vector DNA solution (~ 100 μg/mL) into a 1. 5 -mL microcentrifuge tube. - ii. Add 33 μL of sodium acetate (3 M, pH 5. 5) to the DNA, and thoroughly mix the solution with a pipette. - iii. Add 660 μL of ice-cold 100 % ethanol to the tube, and mix the contents by inverting the tube several times. Let the tube stand on dry ice for 5 min. - *At this step, white fibers of DNA precipitate should be visible*. - iv. Centrifuge the reaction in a microcentrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. For convenience, label the location of the pellet inside the tube with a permanent marker. - v. Remove the supernatant, and wash the pellet with 1 mL of 70 % ethanol at 4 °C by inverting the tube several times. Centrifuge the tube in a microcentrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. - *Carry out all subsequent steps in a sterile environment*. - vi. Remove the supernatant, and immerse the entire open tube in 70 % ethanol for 10 sec. Remove the supernatant. Air-dry the DNA pellet for 10 - 15 min. - vii. Dissolve the dried DNA in 200 μL of sterile H 2 O or TE buffer. - viii. Aliquot DNA dissolved in H 2 O and freeze at - 20 °C for short-term storage. DNA dissolved in TE buffer is stable for at least several weeks at 4 °C. - ix. Remove an aliquot of the DNA, and estimate the concentration and purity of the DNA. 5. Transform cells using calcium-phosphate-precipitated DNA. *Use only chemical transformation with competent cells, not electroporation, because increased recombination following electroporation has been observed. The efficiency of transfection using calcium-phosphate-precipitated DNA strongly depends on the growth state of recipient cells, concentration of calcium and phosphates, concentration of DNA, pH, temperature, and duration of the precipitation reaction. It is advisable to prepare several buffers with slightly different pH values (see Step 5. iii below) *. - i. Plate CHO DG 44 cells in three 75 -cm 2 flasks the day before transfection. - ii. Replace the medium in the flasks with fresh medium 4 h before transfection. Cells should be 50 %- 80 % confluent and be in the log phase of growth for efficient transfection. - iii. Prepare three reaction tubes. In each one, dilute 7 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA (from Step 4. vii) in 0. 5 mL of CaCl 2 (250 mM), mixed with 0. 5 mL of TR buffer, varying only in its pH value (6. 95, 7. 05, or 7. 10). Incubate the reactions for 30 min at room temperature. - iv. Add each DNA mixture dropwise to a flask of cells (from Step 5. ii). Incubate the flasks for 24 h. - v. Replace the transfection medium with F- 12 (HAM) medium supplemented with 10 % defined FBS, and incubate the cells for an additional 24 h. - vi. Replace the medium with selective medium (F- 12 medium lacking thymidine and hypoxanthine, but containing 10 % dialyzed FBS). Stable transformants are obtained after 2 wk of selection. **Enrichment of Stable Cells with Large-Copy-Number Inserts Using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting** *This procedure describes the selection of CHO cells expressing high amounts of exogenous DHFR from a pool of stably transformed cells using cell sorting, a strategy to enrich for cells harboring large chromosome insertions of the DHFR-containing transgene. Selection is based on binding a fluorescent cell-permeable DHFR inhibitor to the pool of cellular DHFR. Cells with high fluorescence show a high total expression of DHFR, which correlates roughly with copy number (as well as chromosome position effects) *. 6. Select and sort the cells as follows: - i. Grow cells in 25 -cm 2 tissue culture flasks until they are in log phase. - ii. Replace the growth medium with fresh F- 12 (HAM) medium supplemented with FBS (10 %) and FMTX (20 μM). Add glycine (100 μM), hypoxanthine (30 μM), and thymine (30 μM) to the medium to relieve the toxic effects of FMTX. Incubate the cells for 8 h. - iii. Harvest cells by trypsinization, and keep them in sterile PBS on ice. - *Because FMTX is retained in cells at concentrations high enough to cause damage, cells are viable in PBS on ice only for several hours*. - iv. Sort the cells into flasks or 96 -well plates. - v. Grow enough cells for freezing, and freeze them after screening. 7. Prepare a large number of clones for screening or subcloning as follows: - i. Plate cells produced in Step 6 onto a Petri dish at a low density, ideally, 20 - 100 cells per 150 -mm dish. To minimize cross-contamination among neighboring colonies, make sure that the density of plating is low enough and that the colonies are spread out. Use several Petri dishes, titrating the cell concentration by factors of 2 - 3 between dishes, to ensure optimal cell density. - *The action of the trypsin (Step 6. iii) must have progressed enough to ensure the absence of cell clumping and the predominance of single cells in suspension. This is aided by mechanical agitation or by vigorous pipetting of the culture*. - ii. Return the cells to the incubator, and if possible, avoid moving the dishes (particularly after the first few days) for ~ 10 d to allow good-size colonies to form. - *Movement of the dishes will cause cells to dislodge and form satellite colonies and/or a lawn of dispersed cells, increasing cross-contamination*. - iii. Allow the cells to grow until the colonies are well-defined and visible by eye while avoiding overgrowth to minimize colony cross-contamination. Mark individual isolated colonies {{on the bottom of the}} plate with a permanent marker. View the colonies under low magnification to check for the presence of undesirable smaller colonies growing in the vicinity of any colony of interest. 8. If visual screening of the clones is unnecessary, then pick and harvest a large number of colonies from the 150 -mm-diameter Petri dish (from Step 7), using one of the subcloning methods described below. If live visual screening is desired, refer to the Discussion regarding subcloning stable transformants. **Trypsin Method for Picking Colonies** - i. Cut filter paper into small squares, each with an area of ~ 4 mm 2. Use sharp-tipped forceps to place the squares together in a glass Petri dish. Cover them and sterilize by autoclaving. - ii. Aspirate the medium from the Petri dish containing the marked colonies (from Step 7. iii above). - iii. Wash the cells with sterile calcium- and magnesium-free PBS (CMF-PBS), and remove excess liquid. - iv. Dispense trypsin solution into a small sterile Petri dish. Using the sterile forceps, dip a sterile filter paper (from Step 8. i) in trypsin, blot it to remove excess trypsin, and place it over a colony. - v. Repeat Step 8. iv for each of the colonies. Return the Petri dish containing the cells to the incubator for ~ 5 min. - vi. Transfer each filter paper into a separate well of a 96 -well microtiter plate containing 0. 1 mL of tissue culture medium per well. If visual screening will be performed, use a glass-bottom 96 -well plate. Duplicate plating can be accomplished by dipping the filter paper into one well to dislodge some cells, and then dropping the filter paper into a well of a second 96 -well plate. - *The efficiency of colony duplication by this method is close to 100 %. Do not leave the cells without buffer for more than 15 - 20 min or they will dry out. Also, CMF-PBS may induce rounding of cells and/or detachment after prolonged treatment (see Steps 8. x and 8. xi) *. - vii. Grow the collected cells in the 96 -well plates for 1 - 2 d. - viii. Remove the filter paper pieces from the wells, taking care to avoid cross-contamination. One method for doing this is to attach a plastic hose to a vacuum system with an in-line trap. Insert the larger end of a 1 -mL micropipette tip into the hose. Cut the other end of the tip to accommodate a sterile 200 -μL micropipette tip. Next, insert the 200 -μL tip into the bottom of a well. The vacuum will cause the filter paper to adhere to the tip. Withdraw the tip, and discard both the filter paper and the 200 -μL pipette tip. Finally, repeat with the remaining wells, using a fresh sterile 200 -μL tip each time. - ix. Continue to grow the cells until their numbers are sufficient for screening. Screen the cells from each well, and freeze the positive clones. Examine the positive clones by microscopy for the biological activity of interest. **Micropipette Tip Method for Picking Colonies** *This method works well with more densely packed colonies, and it is faster than the trypsin method (Steps 8. i- 8. ix). A few hundred colonies can be easily transferred within a couple of hours. Once this method is optimized, efficiency is near 100 %, although the number of cells transferred per colony into the well may be somewhat lower*. - x. Mark the colonies that are less likely to be cross-contaminated with cells from other colonies. Rinse the cells twice with CMF-PBS (10 mL per 150 -mm dish). Add a small amount of CMF-PBS (~ 4 - 6 mL), just sufficient to cover the surface of the dish, and return the dish to the incubator. - xi. After ~ 5 min, look at the cells under a microscope to see if cells in colonies have rounded. If not, incubate further. Once the cells in the colony have rounded, but are still attached, they can be picked. - xii. Use a permanent marker to circle small groups of colonies on the bottom of the dish. This helps to keep track of which colonies have already been harvested. - xiii. Using a fresh 200 -μL pipette tip per colony, scrape two to three times over the colony while aspirating 10 μL into the pipette tip. Insert the pipette tip into the well of a 96 -well plate, pipetting medium from the well several times into the tip to wash the cells off into the well. - xiv. Grow cells until their numbers are sufficient for screening. Screen the cells from each well, and freeze the positive clones. Examine the positive clones by microscopy for the biological activity of interest. ### DISCUSSION In general, screening of clones uses either a visual, microscope-based screen (if possible) or a molecular or biochemical screen. In some cases, both might be combined, either as two sequential screens or one parallel screen. An example from our work is a screen of a set of 96 subclones transfected with a nonfluorescent VP 16 transcriptional activator fusion protein. A visual immunofluorescence assay was used to test directly for expression of the activator, and a transient transfection expression assay was run to test the capability of each clone to activate a luciferase reporter gene. The intersection of these two screens yielded a clone that induced chromosome repositioning after induction of VP 16 targeting. A starting point for subcloning is to determine roughly what fraction of stable transformants show the desired properties. If this fraction is large, then we typically carry out the initial transformation in a single flask, followed by subsequent subcloning of the mixed stable transformant pool by serial dilution cloning into 96 -well plates. A range of dilutions should be used to ensure success. The advantage of serial dilution is that the investigator can more easily verify whether the cells in a given well actually arise from a single clone. If the fraction of desired cells is small (a few percent or less), and if a visual screen is possible, we prepare a single coverslip from the mixed pool of stable transformants and obtain an initial estimate of exactly how many clones need to be screened. One approach is to initially subclone in pools of clones (e. g., five to 10 per well). In theory, this should allow cloning of even rare transformants through several stages of subcloning. Often, however, the desired subclones are rare because of a selective bias against growth of these clones. In this case, if the pool size is too great, the percentage of desired cells can drop in the culture prior to the next stage of subcloning, producing diminishing returns. A better approach, where possible, is cell sorting with flow cytometry to enrich the cell population with cells containing the desired expression levels (see Step 6 above). When large numbers of clones are required, and if visual screening is unnecessary, we simply pick large numbers of colonies from a 150 -mm-diameter Petri dish, using either small, trypsin-soaked pieces of filter paper (Steps 8. i- 8. ix above) or micropipette tips (Steps 8. x- 8. xiv above). These are used to deposit clonal cells into 96 -well plates. Both methods are very rapid but have a high risk of clone contamination, due to the use of a single Petri dish. Any clones selected, based on a secondary screen, must go through an additiona...|$|E

In these investigations, the sodium salts of n-fatty acid esters of hydroxybenzoic acids provided soluble substrates, the hydrolysis of which could be followed continuously by direct spectrophotometric measurement (Hofstee, 1951, 1952 a). The present investigation was undertaken to establish such patterns for esterases in human blood serum. Results by others, reviewed by Whittaker (1951), indicate that the optimal number of n-acyl C atoms for serum cholin-esterase is at least four and is independent of the rest of the substrate molecule. Another enzyme, “A-esterase ” (Aldridge, 1953), present in serum, attacks certain esters at rates decreasing in the order of C 2, C 3, C 4. it was found that serum cholinesterase attacks the present series of substrates (esters of m-hy-droxybenzoic acid) at a rate that increases with the increasing length of the carbon chain of the ester up to at least 10 C atoms.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for isolating Clara {{cells from the}} mouse lung that {{does not require the}} technique of elutriation. Mouse lungs totally perfused of blood are instilled with crystalline trypsin (0. 25 %) and incubated for the optimum time of 15 min. The lung tissue is chopped, mechanically agitated, and sequentially filtered to obtain a primary digest of 3 to 5 x 10 (6) cells. Clara cells, identified routinely by histochemical localization of NADPH diaphorase, using the stain nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT), accounts for between 20 to 40 % of the cells in the primary digest. Layering the cells of the primary digest on a discontinuous Percoll gradient followed by centrifugation gives rise to a major band of cells, 52 % that are Clara cells (0. 77 +/- 0. 28 x 10 (6) /mouse). A second method was devised to purify the Clara cells by simply centrifuging (32 g, 6 min, 10 degrees C) the primary digest and <b>discarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> that contained only a few NBT positive cells.
