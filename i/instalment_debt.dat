40|$|This {{study to}} apply Ricardian Equivalence concept in problem of debt in Indonesia. Ricardian Equivalence express that {{intrinsically}} governmental debt represent burden to society. Equally, governmental debt {{in this time}} is burden expenditure of society in the next year. But with assumption that society behave rationally, hence the debt burden will not in¬fluence society consumption. Based on Kormendi model (1983, 1990, 1995), this study analyse influence inde¬pendent variable to dependent variable. Independent variable are national income (GDP), governmental expenditure (G), tax (TX), subsidy (TR), governmental <b>debt</b> <b>instalment</b> (GINT), and total government debt (GB), and dependent variable is society consumption (PC). This Study used Vector Autoregression (VAR) method which consist of decomposition variance and impulse response analysis. Decomposition variance analysis seen that before crisis period, consumption is in¬fluenced strongly by fiscal policy, consumption and national income. Meanwhile, ini period crisis a period, consumption is influenced by fiscal policy, government debt and government <b>debt</b> <b>instalment.</b> Impulse response analysis found that fiscal policy have effected strongly to consumption in before and after crisis period. On the contrary, tax had an effect weakly to consumption, although do not negativity Meanwhile at before and a period of economic cri¬sis, governmental <b>debt</b> and <b>debt</b> <b>instalment</b> had an effect strongly to consumption. Besides, before crisis national income have influence stronger than subsidy to consumption. But a crisis period, subsidy influence exactly to consumption than to national income. Pursuant to that finding can be expressed that researching into is in general sup¬port of Ricardian Equivalence perspective according to empirical finding of Kormendi, dif¬ferent only fiscal policy influence to consumption. Theoritical of RE state fiscal policy {{do not have an}} effect on to society consumption, but in this research exactly have strong influence. One of argument is since New Order till governance these days, fiscal policy still so central as a means of stimulus growth of national economy...|$|R
25|$|H. M. Ruge and Company, a German trading {{firm that}} {{operated}} from Apia, Samoa, caused controversy when it threatened {{to seize the}} entire island of Vaitupu unless a debt of $13,000 was repaid. The debt {{was the result of}} the failed operations of the Vaitupu Company, which had been established by Thomas William Williams, with part of the debt relating to the attempts to operate the trading schooner Vaitupulemele. The Vaitupuans continue to celebrate Te Aso Fiafia (Happy Day) on 25 November of each year. Te Aso Fiafia commemorates 25 November 1887 which was the date on which the final <b>instalment</b> of the <b>debt</b> of $13,000 was repaid.|$|R

In 1883 the debt of the Vaitupuans was $13,000 and H. M. Ruge and Company had threatened to seize the entire island unless the debt was repaid. Neemia, a Vaitupuan pastor living in Samoa, returned and organised working parties to collect coconuts and prepare copra to sell to pay off the debt, with Henry Nitz, the Webber & Co agent on Vaitupu, contributing money to meet the final payment. The Vaitupuans, with the help of their friends from Funafuti, repaid the debt by the due date. Seven thousand dollars was repaid by 1886 and the balance was paid on 25 November 1887.|$|R
40|$|Using {{a sample}} of small Belgian firms that reorganized under the 1997 Law on Judicial Composition, I empirically review the law's {{effectiveness}} to rehabilitate distressed debtors. The econometric findings show that firms with less pre-bankruptcy operational losses and a better cash position {{are more likely to}} successfully execute their reorganization plan and that certain debt restructuring measures can contribute to firm rescue. Despite these positive findings, many firms still failed to reorganise under the 1997 -reorganization law, which resulted in constant criticism on its effectiveness leading up to its recent replacement in 2009. My data also shows that within the former reorganization procedure the Belgian debtor was faced with high <b>debt</b> <b>instalment</b> payments compared to international practice and that successful plan execution relied too much on the uncertain realization of the operational cash flow projections. In discussing the legal framework of the new Law on Corporate Continuity enacted in 2009 -replacing the 1997 -law-I argue that this new law is a more effective legislation to save distressed businesses...|$|R

40|$|Food {{security}} is important side of national security. Generally, the food security based on three aspect, that is availability of food, society acces to food, {{and stability of}} food price. In Indonesia, rice is strategies commodity {{because it is not}} just economic problem, but it has relevance with social and political problem. Consideration of importance of rice, Indonesia government always try to carry out many policy of food to increase stability of national food. But economic crisis which experienced Indonesia in 1997 cause there are big change in Indonesia food policy. Indonesia government need big financial in handle economic problem, so that IMF (International Monetary Fund) came to Indonesia to give debt with some rules and regulations to Indonesia government which listed in Letter of Intent (LoI). Then, handling of LoI more large and IMF force their importance with relevance foreign debt with some issues, entire of food sectoral. Food security in Indonesia are weak because government make liberazation to market domestic rice. Because there are some negative effect which be emerged from IMF programs, entire food security, in the last of August 2003 Indonesia government decide to finish cooperation with IMF and enter in PPM (Post Program Monitoring) era. PPM era is paying by <b>instalment</b> of <b>debt</b> remains to IMF until quota boundary of 100 percent maximal 7 years. Finally in the year of 2006 Indonesia government paying the rest of debt until boundary of quota, so indirectly have finished PPM era in Indonesia. The method in this research is descriptive analytic. The study result that although Indonesia have paying debt to IMF, but after IMF Indonesia government have create new foreign debt, especially to World Bank and ADB (Asian Development Bank). The foreign debt after IMF then give influence to Indonesia food security, which there are continue food liberazation in Indonesia by moving of foreign debt in Indonesia from IMF to World Bank and ADB. Rules and regulation which be proposed by World Bank and ADB are similar with IMF before. The rules and regulation for example continue privatization target, selling to country assets, reduce of aim to public sector, and erase of impor bea to farmers...|$|R
6000|$|Part of Mr. Strong's {{business}} {{in life was}} to procure this money and other sums, for his patron. And in the Chevalier's apartments, in Shepherd's Inn, many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and Sir Francis Clavering, and many valuable bank-notes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them. When a man {{has been in the}} habit of getting in debt from his early youth, and of exchanging his promises to pay at twelve months against present sums of money, it would seem as if no piece of good fortune ever permanently benefited him: a little while after the advent of prosperity, the money-lender is pretty certain to be in the house again, and the bills with the old signature in the market. Clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at Strong's lodgings than at his own; and such was the Chevalier's friendship for the Baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own, his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which Sir Francis Clavering accepted. Having drawn Clavering's bills, he got them discounted [...] "in the City." [...] When they became due he parleyed with the bill-holders, and gave them <b>instalments</b> of their <b>debt,</b> or got time in exchange for fresh acceptances. Regularly or irregularly, gentlemen must live somehow: and as we read how, the other day, at Comorn, the troops forming that garrison were gay and lively, acted plays, danced at balls, and consumed their rations; though menaced with an assault from the enemy without the walls, and with a gallows if the Austrians were successful,--so there are hundreds of gallant spirits in this town, walking about in good spirits, dining every day in tolerable gaiety and plenty, and going to sleep comfortably; with a bailiff always more or less near, and a rope of debt round their necks--the which trifling inconveniences, Ned Strong, the old soldier, bore very easily.|$|R

Pay back Laura!" [...] And he wrote a letter to her, in which he told her his thanks and his regard; and enclosed to her such an <b>instalment</b> of his <b>debt</b> as nearly wiped it off. The widow and Laura herself might well be affected by the letter. It was written with genuine tenderness and modesty; and old Dr. Portman when he read a passage in the letter, in which Pen, with an honest heart full of gratitude, humbly thanked Heaven for his present prosperity, and for sending him such dear and kind friends to support him in his ill fortune,--when Doctor Portman read this portion of the letter, his voice faltered, and his eyes twinkled behind his spectacles, and when he had quite finished reading the same, and had taken his glasses off his nose, and had folded up the paper and given it back to the widow, I am constrained to say, that after holding Mrs. Pendennis's hand for a minute, the Doctor drew that lady towards him and fairly kissed her: at which salute, of course, Helen burst out crying on the Doctor's shoulder, for her heart was too full to give any other reply: and the Doctor blushing at great deal after his feat, led the lady, with a bow, to the sofa, on which he seated himself by her; and he mumbled out, in a low voice, some words of a Great Poet whom he loved very much, and who describes how in the days of his prosperity he had made [...] "the widow's heart to sing for joy." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{perpetual}} Saturnalia {{in which}} the Negro, in Trinidad at least, lives, will surely give physical strength and health to the body, and something of cheerfulness, self-help, independence to the spirit. If the Saturnalia be prolonged too far, and run, as they seem inclined to run, into brutality and licence, those stern laws of Nature which men call political economy will pull the Negro up short, and waken {{him out of his}} dream, soon enough and sharply enough--a 'judgment' by which the wise will profit and be preserved, while the fools only will be destroyed. And meanwhile, what if in these Saturnalia (as in Rome of old) the new sense of independence manifests itself in somewhat of self-assertion and rudeness, often in insolence, especially disagreeable, because deliberate? What if 'You call me black fellow? I mash you white face in,' were the first words one heard at St. Thomas's from a Negro, on being asked, civilly enough, by a sailor to cast off from a boat to which he had no right to be holding on? What if a Negro now and then addresses you as simple 'Buccra,' while he expects you to call him 'Sir'; or if a Negro woman, on being begged by an English lady to call to another Negro woman, answers at last, after long pretences not to hear, 'You coloured lady! you hear dis white woman a wanting of you'? Let it be. We white people bullied these black people quite enough for three hundred years, to be able to allow them to play (for it is no more) at bullying us. As long as the Negroes are decently loyal and peaceable, and do not murder their magistrates and drink their brains mixed with rum, nor send delegates to the President of Hayti to ask if he will assist them, in case of a general rising, to exterminate the whites--tricks which the harmless Negroes of Trinidad, to do them justice, never have played, or had a thought of playing--we must remember that we are very seriously in debt to the Negro, and must allow him to take out <b>instalments</b> of his <b>debt,</b> now and then, in his own fashion. After all, we brought him here, and we have no right to complain of our own work. If, like Frankenstein, we have tried to make a man, and made him badly; we must, like Frankenstein, pay the penalty.|$|R
