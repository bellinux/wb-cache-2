25|$|Norway {{is part of}} the Schengen Area, an area {{comprising}} 26 European states that have eliminated border controls with other Schengen members and strengthened border controls with non-Schengen countries. When travelling within the Schengen Area, other valid identity documentation (such as a driving licence or EHIC card) is often sufficient. Norway is expected to start issuing national identity cards from 1 April 2018. Citizens holding a national identity card, which states EEA or Swiss citizenship, can not only use it as an <b>identity</b> <b>document</b> within their home country, but also as a travel document to exercise the right of free movement in the EEA and Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|On July 14, 2009, the International Court of Justice in the Hague upheld Costa Rica's {{navigation}} {{rights for}} commercial purposes to subsistence fishing on {{their side of the}} river. An 1858 treaty extended navigation rights to Costa Rica, but Nicaragua denied passenger travel and fishing were part of the deal; the court ruled Costa Ricans on the river were not required to have Nicaraguan tourist cards or visas as Nicaragua argued, but, in a nod to the Nicaraguans, ruled that Costa Rican boats and passengers must stop at the first and last Nicaraguan port along their route. They must also have an <b>identity</b> <b>document</b> or passport. Nicaragua can also impose timetables on Costa Rican traffic. Nicaragua may require Costa Rican boats to display the flag of Nicaragua, but may not charge them for departure clearance from its ports. These were all specific items of contention brought to the court in the 2005 filing.|$|E
25|$|The {{trail was}} opened on 16 June 1961, {{as a result}} of the Polish–Czechoslovak treaty {{concerned}} with tourism and mutual relations. It was made possible to hike along the border, but it still involved some formalities (e.g. identity card and check-in to a hotel) and the trail was not accessible to tourists outside these two countries. In the 1970s and 1980s Polish and Czech dissidents met on the trail, including Jacek Kuroń and Václav Havel. With the implementation of martial law in Poland on 13 December 1981 the trail was closed. It was reinstated in 1984. Paradoxically, despite the declared friendship, the trail route was the subject to some formal issues: Czech authorities claimed that the route infringed the Czech territory by 2 metres. Trips to the peak of Sněžka were possible only if accompanied by a guide approved by local authorities (including the army and militia). After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the name changed to Polish-Czech Friendship Trail and the regulations were reduced considerably: the check-points were often left unstaffed and only random inspections on the border were performed. On the introduction of the Schengen rules in 2007, all border controls were eliminated. Nonetheless, any persons crossing the border must have a valid <b>identity</b> <b>document</b> (ID card, passport) with them.|$|E

25|$|For flights {{within the}} Schengen Area (either between Schengen member states or {{within the same}} Schengen member state), law {{enforcement}} agencies, airport authorities and air carriers are only permitted to carry out security checks on passengers and may not carry out border checks. Such security checks can be conducted through the verification of the passenger's passport or national identity card: Such a practice must only be used to verify the passenger's identity (for commercial or transport security reasons) and not his or her immigration status. For this reason, law enforcement agencies, airport authorities and air carriers cannot require air passengers flying within the Schengen Area who are third-country nationals to prove the legality of their stay by showing a valid visa or residence permit. In addition, according to European Commission guidelines, identity checks on air passengers flying within the Schengen Area should take place only either at check-in, or upon entry to the secured zone of the airport, or at the boarding gate: passengers should {{not be required to}} undergo a verification of their identity {{on more than one occasion}} before their flight within the Schengen Area. Nevertheless, the identity checks function as practical border controls anyway, and are a problem for illegal immigrants who arrive in Greece (which has no land border to another Schengen country) and want to go to some other Schengen country. The requirements as to which <b>identity</b> <b>document</b> to possess varies by country and airline. Normally a passport or EU national identity card is needed. Greece, Iceland and Malta do not share land borders with other Schengen member states.|$|E
