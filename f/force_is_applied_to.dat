5|$|Most fish move by {{alternately}} contracting paired sets {{of muscles}} {{on either side}} of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.|$|E

50|$|Components of {{mechanical}} systems will store elastic potential energy if they <b>are</b> deformed when <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the system. Energy {{is transferred to}} an object (i.e. work is done on it) any time a force external to it displaces or deforms the object. The quantity of energy transferred by work to the object is computed as the vector dot product of the force and the displacement of the object. As <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the system they are distributed internally to its component parts. While some of the energy transferred can end up stored as kinetic energy of acquired velocity, the deformation of the shape of component objects results in stored elastic energy.|$|R

25|$|For example, {{calculating the}} FRF for a massndash&springndash&damper {{system with a}} mass of 1nbsp&kg, spring {{stiffness}} of 1.93nbsp&N/mm and a damping ratio of 0.1. The values of the spring and mass give a natural frequency of 7nbsp&Hz for this specific system. Applying the 1nbsp&Hz square wave from earlier allows the calculation of the predicted vibration of the mass. The figure illustrates the resulting vibration. It happens in this example that the fourth harmonic of the square wave falls at 7nbsp&Hz. The frequency response of the massndash&springndash&damper therefore outputs a high 7nbsp&Hz vibration even though the input force had a relatively low 7nbsp&Hz harmonic. This example highlights that the resulting vibration is dependent on both the forcing function and the system that the <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to.</b>|$|E
500|$|Brown first drew {{inspiration}} from the final scene of Cauldron: the witch's fight against the Pumpking, which bounced around a room. He felt the bouncing pumpkin looked [...] "cool" [...] and decided to base the sequel's gameplay on this aspect. Although unsure about the idea, the other team members proceeded with development. Intended to mimic a bouncing ball, the pumpkin's movement could change direction only if <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> it while it is in contact with a surface that provides friction. This mechanic prohibited the pumpkin from changing directions while in mid-air, and proved problematic for the programmers to implement. Issues included difficulties with collision detection, unpredictable movements that led to glitches, and troubles with the firing mechanism. The pumpkin's ability to fire projectiles was intended to provide offensive game mechanics to players. In early designs, however, the projectile inadvertently generated a force that changed the pumpkin's direction. The programmers tried to correct this, but were unable to create a perfect solution.|$|E

2500|$|A lift jack is {{fundamentally}} a lever that {{attaches to the}} scenery wagon platform with a hinge, with a caster mounted to {{the underside of the}} lever near the hinge. When no downward <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the lever handle, the wagon rests securely on the stage; this effectively locks the wagon in place due to friction between the wagon platform and the stage.

2500|$|Even without {{considerations}} of causality, {{there are other}} strong reasons why faster-than-light travel is forbidden by special relativity.

To an observer who is not accelerating, it appears as though the object's inertia is increasing, so as to produce a smaller acceleration {{in response to the}} same force. This behavior is observed in particle accelerators, where each charged particle is accelerated by the electromagnetic force.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial {{tomato ketchup}} has an additive, usually xanthan gum, {{which gives the}} {{condiment}} a pseudoplastic or [...] "shear thinning" [...] property - more commonly known as thixotropic. This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a relatively small amount added—usually 0.5%—which can {{make it difficult to}} pour from a container. However, the shear thinning property of the gum ensures that when a <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the ketchup it will lower the viscosity enabling the sauce to flow. A common method to getting ketchup out of the bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom with the heel of the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly. A technique involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two fingers (index and middle finger together). Specifically, with a Heinz ketchup glass bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck. This helps the ketchup flow by applying the correct shearing force. These techniques work because of how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (resistance to flow) decreases with increasing shear rate. The faster the ketchup is sheared (by shaking or tapping the bottle), the more fluid it becomes. After the shear is removed the ketchup thickens to its original viscosity.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the seventh}} of December 1965 The Catholic Church {{as part of}} the Vatican II council issued the decree [...] "Dignitatis humanae" [...] that dealt with the rights of the person and {{communities}} to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: [...] "2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [...] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [...] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community".|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the disc}} has {{some level of}} {{variation}} in thickness, uneven pad deposition can accelerate, sometimes resulting in changes to the crystal structure of the metal that composes the disc in extreme situations. As the brakes are applied, the pads slide over the varying disc surface. As the pads pass by the thicker section of the disc, they are forced outwards. The foot of the driver applied to the brake pedal naturally resists this change, and thus more <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the pads. The {{result is that the}} thicker sections see higher levels of stress. This causes an uneven heating of the surface of the disc, which causes two major issues. As the brake disc heats unevenly it also expands unevenly. The thicker sections of the disc expand more than the thinner sections due to seeing more heat, and thus the difference in thickness is magnified. Also, the uneven distribution of heat results in further uneven transfer of pad material. The result is that the thicker-hotter sections receive even more pad material than the thinner-cooler sections, contributing to a further increase in the variation in the disc's thickness. In extreme situations, this uneven heating can actually cause the crystal structure of the disc material to change. When the hotter sections of the discs reach extremely high temperatures ( [...] ), the metal can undergo a phase transformation and the carbon which is dissolved in the steel can precipitate out to form carbon-heavy carbide regions known as cementite. This iron carbide {{is very different from the}} cast iron the rest of the disc is composed of. It is extremely hard, very brittle, and does not absorb heat well. After cementite is formed, the integrity of the disc is compromised. Even if the disc surface is machined, the cementite within the disc will not wear or absorb heat at the same rate as the cast iron surrounding it, causing the uneven thickness and uneven heating characteristics of the disc to return.|$|E

40|$|The {{material}} from which an object is made can determine how heavy it feels (Seashore, 1899). Interestingly, a metal block {{that has been}} adjusted {{to have the same}} size and mass as a polystyrene block will feel lighter than the polystyrene block. We recently showed that participants experiencing this material-weight illusion’ (MWI) do not apply forces that match their perceptual experience of heaviness ‐ just like in the size‐weight illusion (Flanagan 2 ̆ 6 Beltzner, 2000). Our previous study showed that forces on early trials were scaled to each participant’s expectations of how much a particular block should weigh ‐ excessive <b>force</b> <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the metal block and insufficient <b>force</b> <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the polystyrene block.

MWI persisted throughout – the polystyrene block felt the heaviest and the metal block felt the lightest. We followed this finding up with two experiments: Experiment 1 – different weight, different material: We adjusted the weight of each block slightly in the opposite direction to the illusion, predicting that we would find opposing perceptual and motor responses (e. g., Grandy 2 ̆ 6 Westwood, 2006). Experiment 2 – different weight, same material: We also removed the visual differences between the blocks, keeping the slight difference in weight, predicting that the dissociation between perception and action would disappear...|$|R
