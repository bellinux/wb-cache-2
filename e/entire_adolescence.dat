5000|$|Dale Wasserman {{was born}} in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, and was {{orphaned}} {{at the age of}} nine. He lived in a state orphanage and with an older brother in South Dakota before he [...] "hit the rails". He later said, [...] "I'm a self-educated hobo. My <b>entire</b> <b>adolescence</b> was spent as a hobo, riding the rails and alternately living on top of buildings on Spring Street in downtown Los Angeles. I regret never having received a formal education. But I did get a real education about human nature.|$|E
30|$|This {{study was}} not without limitations. A {{sampling}} bias was present as not all subjects had radiographic films throughout their <b>entire</b> <b>adolescence.</b> We helped correct for this by calculating incidence rates for the entire cohort, {{as well as for}} the patients with follow-up beyond one standard deviation from the average age of appearance. The authors anticipate that some patients might have underwent fusion at a later time not captured within the radiologic databank due to the absence of films or poor quality. However, < 1 % of the radiographs (22 of 2642 images) were excluded from subjects within the cohort because of the inability to fully visualize the relevant anatomy due to image quality. In addition, unless specifically addressed in the medical charts, we were unable to determine if patients with symptomatic foot pain underwent any operative intervention in the years during and following data collection. Furthermore, our cohort consisted of subjects limited racially and geographically (middle and upper class Caucasian residents of Cleveland, Ohio from 1929 to 1942). As such, the results from this study are likely not representative of a more diverse general population. Lastly, this study does not provide information on the bilaterality of accessory navicular in pediatric subjects due to the method in which radiographs where collected, namely, only of the left foot and ankle only.|$|E
50|$|His <b>entire</b> {{childhood}} and <b>adolescence</b> {{was spent in}} Nancy, in the east of France. At the age of 16 he left for Paris with his Baccalaureate diploma in his pocket. There he continued his studies in a preparatory class for the “grandes écoles”. He entered the École Supérieure de Commerce of Paris (ESCP). He also has a degree from the Business School of the University of Texas where he continued his studies. He wrote his thesis on management of the American press. He was also a visiting scholar in various American universities including UCLA, Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley, San Francisco State University, the School of Journalism in Columbia Missouri, and Columbia University in New York… As of this time his time was divided between the press and writing. He died on 17 February 2016.|$|R
