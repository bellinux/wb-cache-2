5|$|Right before Van Halen's guitar solo begins, a {{noise is}} heard {{that sounds like}} {{somebody}} knocking at a door. It is reported that the knock was a person walking into Eddie's recording studio. Another story has claimed that the sound was simply the musician <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> his own guitar.|$|E

He prepares to kill her, but Oskar, who was hiding inside the apartment, interferes; Eli immediately wakes up, jumps on Lacke and kills him, feeding on his blood. Eli thanks Oskar and kisses him in gratitude. However, an upstairs neighbor is angrily <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> the ceiling due to the disturbance the fight has caused.

5|$|She has a {{very good}} voice. She's quite shy about it and won't admit it. Lots of people are <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> my door to meet her about everything, movies, what-not. But she's not really {{interested}} in any of it. She just wants to go to school. She says to me, 'Mum, I just want to be a normal kid. I'm not ready for any of that.' I respect that, and if she ever wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E

5|$|Unlike many celebrities Sheldon has met, James Earl Jones welcomes his company, {{and the two}} {{spend the}} night doing various activities; they go to an ice-cream parlor, a carnival, a strip club, and a sauna. Sheldon asks Jones {{questions}} about himself and he confirms that he was functionally mute for eight years, he was a pre-med in college, and that sound designer Ben Burtt used scuba equipment to create the sound of Darth Vader's breathing. They also sing at a karaoke club and prank Carrie Fisher by <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> her door and running away. At {{the end of the}} night, James Earl Jones learns that Sheldon and his friends failed to get Comic-Con tickets and invites them along as his guests.|$|E
5|$|The opening segment, {{reminiscent}} of a traditional British 1950s working class street of terraced houses, was filmed at Carnew Street in Dublin, and features scenes of {{each member of the}} group <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> different doors. Then during the first chorus, the group performs a hand-action dance, that was also used during their live performances. The second half of the video, set {{in the small town of}} Rathdrum, County Wicklow. showed the group interacting with young girls in various activities, such as running around the streets dancing, skipping rope, playing hopscotch, cat's cradle and pat-a-cake, hula hooping, Geri horseback riding, and participating in competitions of various kinds. The locals are depicted as working-class people who attend the local fair or have a drink in the pub. At the end of the video, the group performs at a stage in the local hall in front of an audience of young and old people. The audience applauds after the song is finished. Geri can be seen sticking her tongue out and the video ends.|$|E
5|$|Lana Tisdel's {{potential}} {{involvement in}} the {{rape and murder of}} Brandon Teena was also highlighted. Various people involved in the case, particularly Brandon's family, have alleged that Tisdel was somehow involved with the murders, or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance. Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel's motives came from Tom Nissen, who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present {{at the time of the}} murders in the car and had even tried <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> the door of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert and DeVine were staying. When nobody answered the door, Nissen alleges that Lotter broke in while Tisdel waited in the vehicle while the murders were carried out. Tisdel denied this and a lack of evidence meant that it could not be vigorously pursued in the proceeding court case—the residing judge considered most of Nissen's claims as nothing more than hearsay. Not only did Tisdel vehemently deny any involvement in Brandon's murder, she denied ever being present at Lisa Lambert's farmhouse on the night Brandon was murdered. Unlike Tisdel's own evidence and the admissions presented in court, Boys Don't Cry took the liberty of placing Tisdel at the crime scene, albeit without any intention of setting Brandon up.|$|E

They did not seem to canvass the area, either, never <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> doors and asking residents what they might have seen. The police also left Hedgepeth's car unsecured while they searched the apartments.|$|E

When they found the demons, they drove them out of the hiding place, and fought with them {{swinging}} their sabers and clubs. After the demons were chased away, the koledari briefly danced the kolo, and then blessed the household. As a reward, they received a loaf of bread which the family prepared specially for them, and other food gifts.|$|E

Socrates relates the story of how his young friend, Hippocrates, son of Apollodorus, came <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> his door before daybreak and roused him out of bed.
