6000|$|... "Not much," [...] responded Demorest, dryly; [...] "but {{if people}} choose to believe this bluff gotten up by the petty thieves {{themselves}} to increase their importance and secure their immunity--they can. But <b>here's</b> Manuel <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> supper is ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{far from}} {{regarding}} it {{as a matter}} of course, Admiral Bluewater; but, it has been done sufficiently often, to render it an event of no very violent possibility. Ah, <b>here</b> is Magrath <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> the condition of his patient." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Here</b> he digressed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> {{that he was}} a {{beginner}} at that time at the salary of a pound a week and fifteen shillings a day for travelling expenses. He thought this a great thing at first; when he heard what he was to get he walked about on air all day long, repeating to himself, [...] "Fifteen shillings a day for expenses!" [...] It was incredible; he had been poor, earning about five shillings a week, and now he had suddenly come into this splendid fortune. It wouldn't be much for him now! He began by spending recklessly; and in a short time discovered that the fifteen shillings didn't go far; now he had come to his senses and had to practise a rigid economy. Accordingly, he thought he would save the cost of a night's lodging and go back to town. But the Bristol man was anxious to keep him and said he had hired a man and boat to go fishing with the boys,--why couldn't he just engage a bedroom for the night and spend the afternoon with them? ...|$|R
6000|$|Elinor {{glanced at}} Marian, {{and saw that}} though Douglas was {{speaking}} {{to her in a}} low voice, she was listening nervously to her husband. So she said sharply, [...] "It is a pity you were not <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what to do." ...|$|E

Eunice flung the door open. [...] "Well, father, we've got Dan back again." [...] And at a look of quiet {{question}} in his eye she hurried on: [...] "His engagement's broken, and he's come up <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> and brought Mr. Boardman along to help." ...|$|E
6000|$|Moreover--and this is noteworthy--the Gospels, {{and indeed}} all Scripture, very seldom {{palliate}} {{the misery of}} disease, by drawing from it those moral lessons which we ourselves do. I say very seldom. The Bible does so <b>here</b> and there, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that we may do so likewise. And we may thank God heartily that the Bible does so. It would be a miserable world, if all that the clergyman or the friend might say by the sick-bed were, 'This is an inevitable evil, like hail and thunder. You must bear it if you can: and if not, then not.' A miserable world, {{if he could not}} say with full belief; '"My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of Him. For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth." [...] Thou knowest not now why thou art afflicted; perhaps thou wilt never know in this life. But a day will come when thou wilt know: when thou wilt find that this sickness came to thee at the exact right time, in the exact right way; when thou wilt find that God has been keeping thee in the secret place of His presence from the provoking of men, and hiding thee privately in His tabernacle from the spite of tongues; when thou wilt discover that thou hast been learning precious lessons for thy immortal spirit, while thou didst seem to thyself merely tossing with clouded intellect on a bed of useless pain; when thou wilt find that God was nearest to thee, at the very moment when He seemed to have left thee most utterly.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Virginia has come," [...] Vine said, [...] "to tell us {{that your}} father is {{inclined}} to play {{the part of a}} benevolent parent.

6000|$|... "I {{know not}} why, Ana," [...] said Seti, [...] "but {{for the first}} time since I was a man I feel afraid. It seems to me that there are omens in the sky and I cannot read them. Would that Ki were <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what is {{signified}} by the pillar of blackness to the right and the pillar of fire to the left, and what god has his home in the city of glory behind, and how man's feet may walk along the shining road which leads to its pylon gates. I tell you that I am afraid; it is as though Death were very near to me and all his wonders open to my mortal sight." ...|$|E
40|$|Rt. Rev. Mgr. James E. Cassidy and Rev. Dr. Francis J. Bradley {{complain}} {{before the}} Board of Health about the “filthy conditions {{which they have}} discovered in houses and yards in certain sections of the city. ” It was finally decided that the Street department “be requested to use extra endeavors in cleaning up certain streets and that landlords be asked to put their yards and houses in cleaner condition. ”. Some of the discussion:• Cassidy: `We thought we would {{try to find out}} if the Board of Health could not get some order for the cleaning up of yards. In many of the yards of the tenement house districts are to be found dead animals and refuse of all kinds [...] We do not know just what authority the Board of Health has in this matter. ’• Bradley: `One of the most difficult jobs we have found is the actual cleaning of person who have been taken from these tenements to our hospitals. They were really covered with vermin, filth, and dirt, and in some cases, one cleaning and washing has not been enough. We know we could not begin to live in some of the tenements which we have seen and it is a wonder how these people have lived in them. We have found tenements where there were [...] . eight, nine, or 10 [people]. People sleeping on the floors of tenements, sleeping with bed clothes for covering, which appeared never to have been washed, and throwing over these old cots and old shawls, which they had worn at their work, to help the load to keep them warm. It seems to me that if the men going around to these places found a sick person in such a tenement, they should [...] . remove the patient and then take means to clean out thoroughly such places. Clean even the furniture, if necessary. Scrub such places from top to bottom. Perhaps the State Guard could help [...] ’• Borden: ‘The trouble is we haven’t got the money [...] The probability is that this bacilli is one that does not live long in the human body and you are not likely to get disease by an contact on the clothes or anything of that sort. If you have a glass or something like that which has been used by a person having the disease, there is the danger of infection in that way [...] There is a difference between a plain dirt [sic] and a pathogenic germ. Plain dirt is not particularly harmful. Dirt with germs in it is very harmful. If the germs are alive. ’• Dr. Crispo: `The board has always tried to have things kept clean. We have talked of having a tenement house inspection. It is a very difficult problem in a city like this. The population here is very hard to handle. ’• Cassidy suggests using Boy Scouts as inspectors and later suggest a three day notice to landlords. • Mr. Borden says that the board cannot order people to clean up. • During exchange on improper and illegal dumping, Cassidy cites unclean dirt and Borden says ‘Our plans have not been carried through the way we would want them carried through. But it seems like a perfectly easy thing with the aid of some more organizations. ”• Borden: `I think that in all of these things out-of-doors this bacilli is very quickly killed and they do not do any harm if they do not get into the human body [...] The only way of combating [...] . [filthy] condition is by education. We can’t make laws to make people keep clean. What are you going to do about it? Take the person with vermin into court. [sic] There is no penalty you can inflict upon him [...] The American citizen is a free and independent person and the only way we can do anything with him is when he may have a contagious disease. • Bradley: `Well, suppose there are five or six in a tenement and one of them is stricken with a disease, isn’t there a way of removing that one person from such surroundings and making them such that the others will not be in the grasp [...] . ’• Borden: ‘What would you do with the house?’• Bradley: ‘Send the State Guard in, have them put the hose on the place and wash it out from top to bottom. ’• Borden: ‘That would give the tenants a beautiful shock. ’• Cassidy: ‘There is no power that the Board of Health has?’• Borden: ‘We can order such a place like that to be cleaned out. That is what we are trying to do the year round. When we find them overcrowded, we notify them that they have got to stop it. They move out and go somewhere else and take in another bunch. With the little force which we have at work [two inspectors], it is absolutely impossible to keep up a proper inspection of such conditions [...] The amount of money which is spent in the health department of Fall River is much less than that spent for any of the major departments of the city. We have always urged more appropriations, but we have never got them [...] We have the biggest infant mortality of any place around here. ’• Cassidy: ‘I have noticed in many tenements open milk bottles in the hallways and the refrigerators with their tops up and the food exposed. ’• Borden: ‘You people come in <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> your troubles and we would like to tell you ours. ’• Borden says using the State Guard for cleaning would “take all the poetry out of” their relief work. • Borden says that St. Joseph’s Orphan’s home had a larger percentage of cases than he could remember in any of the camp or civilian epidemics and urged that the situation be watched carefully. • The undertaker is complained about for not picking up dead bodies fast enough.

40|$|Scientific, {{and more}} {{specifically}} empirical observations, are incapable of deriving a cohesive moral theory based solely on those distinctions. What we find in the ethical world is far more complex than any one series of observations and scientific theories which could establish or break down existing moral theory. Definitions and ethical codes regarding behavior require a more robust and creative approach. The thesis of this paper is, then, no scientific descriptions are descriptions that are able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> how things ought to be. A valid standard form categorical syllogism can be formulated to demonstrate how this conclusion is arrived at by logical necessity.
