Simulations were performed on sub-tree structures (shoot and branch) to analyze the response of the model to three main parameters (α: the transfer rate, proportion of signal moved to the next metamer, σ: the parameter driving the partition of the signal into acropetal and basipetal fluxes, and L: the internode length).

We studied whether STAT 3 activity affects sorafenib- and sunitinib-induced cell growth inhibition in HaCaT cells by WST- 8 assay. Stattic enhanced the cell-growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of sorafenib and sunitinib. HaCaT cells transfected with constitutively-active STAT 3 (STAT 3 C) were resistant to the sorafenib- and sunitinib-induced cell growth inhibition. STAT 3 activity decreased after short-term treatment with sorafenib and sunitinib in a dose-dependent manner and recovered after long-term treatment with sorafenib and sunitinib at low doses. Moreover, the expression of survivin and bcl- 2 decreased after treatment with sorafenib and sunitinib was concomitant with variations in STAT 3 activity. Sorafenib-induced STAT 3 inhibition was mediated by regulation via MAPK pathways in HaCaT cells, while sunitinib-induced STAT 3 inhibition was not.

The levels of NO and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) released from murine macrophage RAW 264 cells were increased dose- and time-dependently following treatment with LPS (1 µg/ml). GGA (80 µM) treatment 2 h before LPS addition significantly suppressed TNF-α and NO productions at 12 h and 24 h after LPS, respectively, indicating that GGA inhibits activation of macrophages. However, replacement by fresh culture medium before LPS treatment abolished the inhibitory effect of GGA on NO production in LPS-treated cells. Furthermore, GGA inhibited both HSP 70 and inducible NO synthase expressions induced by LPS treatment despite an HSP inducer. When it was examined whether GGA interacts with LPS and/or affects expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) and CD 14 on the cell surface, GGA inhibited the binding of LPS to the cell surface, while GGA did not affect TLR 4 and CD 14 expressions.

Murine BV 2 microglia cells, with or without pretreatmentof GBE 50 at various concentrations, were activated by incubation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A series of biochemical and microscopic assays were performed to measure cell viability, cell morphology, release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), and signal transduction via the p 38 MAPK and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p 65 pathways.

SMFmb–IL- 15 (1) induces lineage-spe-cific signaling pathways that differ from those controlled by soluble IL- 15 in unprimed and committed normal progeni-tors; (2) triggers survival and prolifera-tion of leukemic progenitors expressing low-affinity IL- 15 R (M 07 Sb cells); (3) causes only an antiapoptotic effect on leukemic cells expressing high-affinity re-ceptors (TF 1 cells). This behavior is likely due to the IL- 15 R chain present on these cells that interact with the SMFmb– IL- 15, <b>inhibiting</b> <b>signal</b> transducer and transcriptional activator 5 (STAT 5) activa-tion.

The effect of LAIR 1 ligation by specific monoclonal antibodies, collagen or collagen producing mesenchymal stromal cells from reactive lymph nodes or bone marrow on Ig production by pokeweed mitogen and B cell receptor (BCR) -mediated NF-kB activation was assessed by ELISA and TransAM assay. The percentage of CD 20 (+) B lymphocytes lacking or showing reduced expression of LAIR 1 was markedly increased in SLE and MCTD but not in SSc or RA patients compared to HD.

We quantified components of the T cell receptor, the membrane proximal signaling, MAPK-signaling, IL- 2 R, histone modifications and the cytoskeleton in non-activated and in ConA/CD 28 -activated primary human T lymphocytes. The hypergravity phase during the launch resulted in a downregulation of the IL- 2 and CD 3 receptor and reduction of tyrosine phosphorylation, p 44 / 42 -MAPK phosphorylation and histone H 3 acetylation, whereas LAT phosphorylation was increased. Compared to the baseline situation {{at the point of}} entry into the microgravity phase, CD 3 and IL- 2 receptor expression at the surface of non-activated T cells were reduced after 6 min microgravity. Importantly, p 44 / 42 -MAPK-phosphorylation was also reduced after 6 min microgravity compared to the 1 g ground controls, but also in direct comparison between the in-flight μg and the 1 g group. In activated T cells, the reduced CD 3 and IL- 2 receptor expression at the baseline situation recovered significantly during in-flight 1 g conditions, but not during microgravity conditions. Beta-tubulin increased significantly after onset of microgravity {{until the end of the}} microgravity phase, but not in the in-flight 1 g condition. This study suggests that key proteins of T cell signal modules are not severely disturbed in microgravity. Instead, it can be supposed that the strong T cell <b>inhibiting</b> <b>signal</b> occurs downstream from membrane proximal signaling, such as at the transcriptional level as described recently.

40|$|Members of the TNF {{receptor}} superfamily, many {{of which}} are important for immune and inflammatory responses, have been shown to utilize ubiquitination for signal transduction. Two proteins, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (c-IAP 1 / 2), play central roles in the signaling cascades from these receptors through their ubiquitin ligase activity. In certain pathways, c-IAP 1 / 2 actively propagate receptor-mediated signaling through the construction of ubiquitin scaffolds within the receptor signaling complex, while in other situations, c-IAP 1 / 2 constitutively target substrate proteins for ubiquitination and degradation, <b>inhibiting</b> <b>signal</b> transduction. Activation of these signaling pathways is dependent on the degradation of c-IAP 1 / 2, a process that is associated with stimulation of specific members of the TNF receptor superfamily. While the biological properties of c-IAP 1 / 2 are context-dependent, the exact roles and outcomes of c-IAP 1 / 2 activity in these different circumstances are unclear. In the work presented in this dissertation, these diverse roles of c-IAP 1 / 2 in signaling were further explored, characterizing the signaling pathways in which they participate, investigating their regulation, and identifying the downstream consequences of their activity. Using multiple methods to study the function of c-IAP 1 / 2, including activation of TNF receptor superfamily members and treatment with synthetic compounds that target and degrade c-IAP 1 / 2, novel aspects of c-IAP 1 / 2 activity in signaling were characterized. Specifically, the regulation of canonical and non-canonical NF-kappa B activation by c-IAP 1 / 2 was investigated, finding that the consequences of c-IAP 1 / 2 activity were cell type-specific. Furthermore, important regulatory crosstalk between the NF-kappa B signaling pathways was identified in cells that activated both canonical and non-canonical NF-kappa B. Additionally, novel roles for c-IAP 1 / 2 were identified using transcriptome analysis and a technique called Bru-seq, and these roles included the regulation of ribosomal gene expression and protein synthesis. These results may have important clinical implications, since the IAPs are actively being studied as potential therapeutic targets. Collectively, these findings expand our understanding of ubiquitin-dependent signaling and, more specifically, provide crucial insight into the multifaceted functions of c-IAP 1 and c-IAP 2 in key intracellular signaling pathways...|$|E

CXCL 4 L 1 (1 - 70) was the most abundant isoform, whereas CXCL 4 L 1 (- 4 - 70) was detected in 50 % of the platelet preparations. Since alterations to the NH 2 -terminus of chemokines can have severe biological consequences, we investigated the impact of the extension with 4 NH 2 -terminal amino acids on the biological activity of CXCL 4 L 1.

In a FITC-conjugated dextran cell permeability assay, both splice variants showed a strong but comparable anti-permeable effect upon VEGF stimulation of the endothelial cell monolayer. In vivo angiogenesis induced by FGF- 2 was equally reduced by CXCL 4 L 1 (1 - 70) and CXCL 4 L 1 (- 4 - 70). In chemotaxis assays with CXCR 3 A-transfected cells the CXCL 4 L 1 isoforms both induced migration from 125 ng/ml onward. Finally, CXCL 4 L 1 (1 - 70) and CXCL 4 L 1 (- 4 - 70) showed the same affinity for heparin. In conclusion, the investigated biological activities of CXCL 4 L 1 are not influenced by the four extra NH 2 -terminal residues present in the alternatively spliced isoform CXCL 4 L 1 (- 4 - 70). Therefore, our results suggest that both isoforms equally interact with the CXCR 3 A and CXCR 3 B receptor. status: publishe...|$|E

This was achieved with a commonly used cholesterol lowering statin drug. [...] The statin <b>inhibited</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways required for the tumor generating activities of the MYC oncogene. This study is an important demonstration in the efficacy of targeting tumors prior to onset.|$|R
40|$|The Drosophila short {{gastrulation}} gene (sog) encodes a large extracellular protein (Sog) that <b>inhibits</b> <b>signaling</b> by BMP-related ligands. Sog and its vertebrate counterpart Chordin contain four {{copies of}} a cysteine repeat (CR) motif defined by 10 cysteine residues spaced in a fixed pattern and a tryptophan residue situated between the first two cysteines. Here we present a structure-function analysis of the CR repeats in Sog, using a series of deletion and point mutation constructs, as well as constructs in which CR domains have been swapped. This analysis indicates that the CR domains are individually dispensable for Sog function but {{that they are not}} interchangeable. These studies reveal three different types of Sog activity: intact Sog, which <b>inhibits</b> <b>signaling</b> mediated by the ligand Glass bottom boat (Gbb), a more broadly active class of BMP antagonist referred to as Supersog, and a newly identified activity, which may promote rather than <b>inhibit</b> BMP <b>signaling.</b> Analysis of the activities of CR swap constructs indicates that the CR domains are required for full activity of the various forms of Sog but that the type of Sog activity is determined primarily by surrounding protein sequences. Cumulatively, our analysis suggests that CR domains interact physically with adjacent protein sequences to create forms of Sog with distinct BMP modulatory activities...|$|R
