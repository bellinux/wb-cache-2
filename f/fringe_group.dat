25|$|On October 6, BioWare {{announced}} the second planned expansion, entitled Shadow of Revan. The expansion {{is centered on}} the Order of Revan, formerly a <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> that appeared early in Imperial missions, now a great army seeking {{to establish a new}} galactic order, led by the reborn Revan himself. The campaign raised the level cap to 60, and takes place on two new worlds: Rishi, a tropical pirate haven {{on the edge of the}} galaxy, and Yavin 4 (which first appeared in the original Star Wars film), home of an ancient Sith warrior sect called the Massassi. Shadow of Revan was available for preorder. Players who preordered before November 2, 2014, received an experience boost that granted twelve times multiplicative experience for class-related missions, seven days of early access, a grand statue of Revan for placement in strongholds, and a free edition of Rise of the Hutt Cartel (to give to another player). The expansion was released on December 9, 2014.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, {{approximately}} 1,200 protesters, primarily Latino high-school age students {{joined by}} Jobs with Justice, {{took part in}} the 2006 United States immigration reform protests. In 2007, 15,000 protesters of all ages began a rally and march as part of the March 17, 2007 anti-war protest, including local activists affiliated with the radical Students for a Democratic Society. After a <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> broke off from the protest and burned a US soldier in effigy, Michelle Malkin stated that [...] "Portland hates America." [...] The Drudge Report, Lars Larson, and conservative blogs also commented on the effigy, and protest organizers with the American Friends Service Committee stated [...] "We had a massive, peaceful demonstration against the killing and destruction going on every day in Iraq, a positive experience for thousands of people from different walks of life, and apparently the right-wing fringe is going to pick up that little portion." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{political}} {{background of}} the plot depicts an alliance between Scottish nationalist <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> and loyalist paramilitaries who believe they're being 'sold out' in the peace deal with the IRA. While there is significant support for loyalist paramilitarism in Scotland, radical Scottish nationalist <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> {{are far more likely}} to support the Irish Republican cause and to see the Republic of Ireland as a partial role model for an independent Scotland.|$|R
50|$|Her {{changing}} and increasingly radical beliefs increasingly ostracised her from mainstream Christianity {{and even from}} <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> such as the Millerites and Mormons.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{new forms}} of {{antisemitism}} is the denial of the Holocaust by revisionist historians and neo-Nazis. Holocaust denial serves as a powerful conspiracy theory uniting otherwise disparate <b>fringe</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
500|$|McCarthyism also attracts {{controversy}} purely as {{a historical}} issue. Through declassified documents from Soviet archives and Venona project decryptions of coded Soviet messages, it has become known that the Soviet Union engaged in substantial espionage activities in the United States during the 1940s. [...] It is also known that the Communist Party USA was substantially funded and its policies controlled by the Soviet Union, and there are accusations that CPUSA members were often recruited as spies. In the view of some contemporary commentators, these revelations stand as at least a partial vindication of McCarthyism. [...] Some feel {{that there was a}} genuinely dangerous subversive element in the United States, and that this danger justified extreme measures. Others, while acknowledging that there were inexcusable excesses during McCarthyism, argue that some contemporary historians of McCarthyism underplay the depth of Soviet espionage in America or the undemocratic nature of the CPUSA, the latter concern being shared by some Trotskyites who felt that they, and anti-Stalin socialists in general, were persecuted by the CPUSA.Any serious assessment of McCarthyism must consider fore and center the criminal role played by the Stalinist Communist Party, which, by associating socialism with terrible crimes against the working class, helped create the political climate in which red-baiting could flourish. [...] The opposing view holds that, recent revelations notwithstanding, by the time McCarthyism began in the late 1940s, the CPUSA was an ineffectual <b>fringe</b> <b>group,</b> and the damage done to U.S. interests by Soviet spies after World War II was minimal. Historian Ellen Schrecker, herself criticised for pro-Stalinist leanings, has written, [...] "in this country, McCarthyism did more damage to the constitution than the American Communist Party ever did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Questioning whether HIV is {{the cause}} of AIDS, {{claiming}} manifestations of AIDS (including opportunistic infections and death) {{may be the result of}} [...] "psychological stress" [...] brought on by the belief that HIV is harmful. The scientific community considers the evidence that HIV causes AIDS conclusive. [...] Mercola.com has also featured positive presentations of the claims of AIDS denialists, a <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> which denies the existence of AIDS and/or the role of HIV in causing it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{creation}} of the Canadian Alliance, and its eventual merger in 2003 with the Progressive Conservative Party to form the new Conservative Party of Canada, alienated {{some of the old}} Reform populists, who saw the merger as the final demise of the former Reform Party and the return of Tory indifference to western Canadian concerns. This led to the {{creation of}} a new [...] "Reform Association of Canada". [...] "Bring Back Real Reform" [...] also was created by a <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> of original Reformers from Ontario, with the aim of bringing back a federal Reform Party. Under the tag [...] "Operation Back to the Future", it was launched in Spring 2005 as an umbrella for all original Reformers across the nation who felt that they were still without a political home. Neither of these groups has attracted any support.|$|E

50|$|Many {{conservative}} Christian {{groups were}} critical of Explo '72 for its ecumenical involvement with both Protestant and Roman Catholic ministries, {{and for its}} use of rock music. The event attracted Jesus movement <b>fringe</b> <b>groups,</b> including the Children of God and the Christian World Liberation Front.|$|R
50|$|The group formed part of {{a number}} of Conservative Party linked <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> which came to {{prominence}} in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Monday Club, Tory Action and WISE (Welsh, Irish, Scottish, English), but is now positioned outside of the Conservative Party.|$|R
2500|$|Fan {{reaction}} to leaked news that Spock {{would be killed}} was overwhelmingly negative, and one fan paid for advertisements urging Paramount to abandon the plan. Nimoy said afterwards that [...] "I thought everything was managed in excellent taste. I feel proud. When it was first suggested to me that Spock would die, I was hesitant. It seemed exploitative. But now that I've seen how it was accomplished, I {{think it was a}} very good idea." [...] Some fans even went so far as to issue death threats against Leonard Nimoy's family. Bennett explained, [...] "For some reason fans got the impression that [...] wanted Spock dead. He'd written a book I Am Not Spock, and that gave people the idea. Anyway, when a <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> of Trekkies learned that we were going to kill the Spock character, it was like we'd taken a child of theirs onto the Brooklyn Bridge with the intention of throwing it off. And their reaction was, 'Let's get Leonard.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, the [...] "charity" [...] {{was anxious}} to detain children, both not {{sedentary}} and sedentary families, propelled implement of origin or in foreign families. Not a real driving lifestyle of the parents was the decisive criterion of a child removal, but [...] "belonging to a collective wearer as socially damaging properties classified <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> of tinker, basketters, scissor sharpener, beggars, [...] "or worse". In some cases, children have been taken away from their mothers immediately after birth. The children were housed usually in homes, in some cases also in foreign families, in psychiatric hospitals and in prisons or assigned as forced child laborers to farming families. Contacts between children and parents were systematically prevented. Sometimes even the term of [...] "charity ward" [...] was changed to remain undetectable for their relatives. Child abuse was legitimized as education for work. In the 1930/40s the child removals peaked, resulting in more than 200 Yenish children {{under the control of}} [...] "charity".|$|E
2500|$|The 1971 NDP {{leadership}} {{convention was}} a battleground between the party establishment and the Waffle. About 2000, {{out of the}} NDP's approximately 90,000 membership, {{were members of the}} Waffle in 1971. The Waffle tried to get as many of their supporters onto the party's governing bodies, but were rebuked by the large bloc of rank-and-file union voters at the convention. [...] Carol Gudmundson — of the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan Waffle — ran unsuccessfully for the party presidency. [...] She was up against former Ontario NDP leader Donald C. MacDonald and lost to him during the April 23rd vote. [...] University of Toronto professor Mel Watkins lost his vice-president position, but managed to get elected to the party's federal council. The campaign for leader of the NDP pitted David Lewis against James Laxer. [...] Through the strong support of the labour unions, Lewis succeeded in defeating Laxer on the fourth ballot on April 24. Laxer won approximately 37 percent of the final ballot vote, and established that the Waffle had some strength in the party and were no longer a small <b>fringe</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
50|$|A former {{features}} {{editor and}} current {{contributing editor for}} British GQ, he has written for several magazines and newspapers including The Observer, The Daily Telegraph, The Times, The Los Angeles Times, Marie Claire, Maxim and Details.

50|$|Sepharial's {{comments}} {{ignored the}} fact that Waltemath's proposed moon had already been discredited by the scientific community {{at the turn of}} the century. There are many readily apparent holes in the arguments supporting Lilith's existence, and the existence of this astronomical object is believed only by <b>fringe</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} set of policies, the {{government}} targeted specific policies and actions at <b>fringe</b> <b>groups.</b> An example of this is the Accelerated Rural Development Programme of 1964, the Isan component of which included the strengthening of allegiance to Bangkok {{and the rest of the}} country as one of its objectives.|$|R
2500|$|Some social {{conservative}} organizations, {{including the}} Family Research Council defended Akin. A {{spokesman for the}} Council said, [...] "We feel {{this is a case}} of gotcha politics...We know who Todd Akin is. We've worked with him up on the hill. He's a defender of life." [...] A representative of the American Family Association cited Willke's 1999 article and said Akin [...] "was exactly right". In response to Republican demands that Akin resign, Personhood USA spokeswoman Jennifer Mason said that Akin's position [...] "is {{an integral part of the}} Republican Party platform, the same position that was held by President Ronald Reagan" [...] and that [...] " [...] are left with Reagan Republicans, who agree with the Republican Party platform on abortion, and Romney Republicans, a <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> of liberals who compromise on human life." [...] Mike Huckabee supported Akin by soliciting donations for his Senate campaign and accused the Republican establishment of a [...] "carefully orchestrated and systematic attack." [...] He was also critical of the Republican Senatorial Committee for demanding Akin's resignation.|$|E
2500|$|On February 19, 2017, Robert Allen wrote a {{piece for}} the Detroit Free Press, which was republished by USA Today about Voris that also invoked Bannon. The article {{declared}} that Voris' studio in Ferndale was [...] "the nerve center for a growing, religious group hoping the forces that elected President Donald Trump will tear down the wall between church and state." [...] The article called Voris' apostolate [...] "a <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> claiming to be Catholic but denounced by the church, [...] broadcasts pro-life, anti-gay, anti-feminist, Islam-fearing content on its website". It noted that Voris had dismissed Trump's past moral problems by making an analogy with Constantine the Great, whom Voris called a [...] "power-hungry egomaniac" [...] but {{who served as a}} human vessel by which God ended Christian persecution and protected Christianity. Voris was quoted saying, [...] "The personal proclivities, the personal sins or life of a particular leader is a separate discussion from how that man's view of the world might influence his policies. And if that policy is favorable to the church, well then, very good." [...] The article held that [...] "Many of Church Militant's headlines are similar to those on Breitbart News, the far-right news organization that White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon previously ran." [...] It noted [...] "Many of Breitbart's articles are cited on the Church Militant website. But unlike Breitbart, Church Militant is under a Christian, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization." ...|$|E

25|$|They {{therefore}} {{claim that}} it is morally indefensible for Daneel to ruthlessly sacrifice robots and extraterrestrial sentient life {{for the benefit of}} humanity. None of these reinterpretations successfully displace Daneel's Zeroth Law — though Foundation's Triumph hints that these robotic factions remain active as <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> up to the time of the novel Foundation.|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> and {{individuals}} {{such as those}} within some fundamentalist religious organizations, survivalists, cults, anti-social movements, self-sufficiency enthusiasts, communes and others attracted to conspiracy theories, embraced Y2K {{as a tool to}} engender fear and provide a form of evidence for their respective theories. End-of-the-world scenarios and apocalyptic themes were common in their communication.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, many fringe theatres began to receive small subsidies. After the 1973-74 stock market crash, many fringe {{companies}} {{were forced to}} close.

25|$|The {{relatively}} {{limited space}} given to Nazi German propaganda and ideology, or their domestic sympathizer <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> in Finland, can probably {{be seen as}} one of the many important joint contributions of Ryti, Tanner, and Mannerheim. Ryti's government must also be credited for the fact that Finland remained a genuine democracy unlike any other continental European country that participated in World War II.|$|R
50|$|Anti-Catalanism in {{its most}} virulent form is mostly {{associated}} with far-right Spanish political parties. <b>Fringe</b> <b>groups</b> such as España 2000 (none of which obtained more than 0.5% of the votes in the last general elections) object strongly to the autonomy enjoyed by Catalonia, claiming that the granting of autonomy to Catalonia and other regions {{will lead to the}} breakup of Spain.|$|R

5000|$|Despite various {{initiatives}} aimed at [...] "rebuilding the black movement", the organisation was, by the mid-1990s, {{more of a}} marginal <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> {{than it had been}} in 1970.|$|E

5000|$|In post-war Germany {{the fate}} of civilians and prisoners of war has been a {{contentious}} topic. The current view of the German government is that these losses were due to an aggressive war started by the German nation. [...] However, there are <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> who attempt to trivialize the crimes of the Hitler period by comparing German losses to the Holocaust.|$|R
2500|$|If {{there is}} a single {{criticism}} to be made of Gardner ... it is that he accepts too comfortably the conventional wisdom, or accepted social reality, of current twentieth-century science and middle-class American Christianity. Somehow it is evident (to me at least) that he is implicitly making a pact with the reader to evaluate these <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> in terms of their own shared presumptions about what is [...] "normal". Thus he is quite confident throwing around labels like [...] "quack", [...] "crank" [...] and [...] "preposterous". In science the use of such value judgments can be quite time-bound; likewise in religions where today's heresy may become tomorrow's orthodoxy. The odds of course are always {{on the side of the}} writer criticizing <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> because statistically speaking so few of them survive. However, when a group does weather its infancy and go on to prosper, invariably its original detractors look a bit more arbitrary than they did initially, and then the shoe is on the other foot.|$|R
50|$|According to Erdoğan's 4 June {{speech from}} Morocco, the demonstrators are mostly looters, {{political}} losers and extremist <b>fringe</b> <b>groups.</b> He {{went on to}} say they went hand-in-hand with 'terrorists' and 'extremists'. He indicated that these protests were organised by the Republican Peoples Party (even though the CHP had initially supported construction on the Gezi-park). Turkey analysts however suggested the demonstrations arose from bottom-up processes, lacking leadership.|$|R
