40|$|We {{address the}} {{quantification}} of nonlinearity for quantum oscillators and introduce two measures {{based on the}} properties of the ground state rather than on the form of the potential itself. The first measure is a fidelity-based one and corresponds to the renormalized Bures distance between the ground state of the considered oscillator and the ground state of a reference harmonic oscillator. Then, {{in order to avoid the}} introduction of this auxiliary oscillator, we introduce a different measure based on the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the ground state. The two measures are evaluated for a sample of significant nonlinear potentials and their properties are discussed in some detail. We show that the two measures are monotone functions with respect to each other in most cases, and this suggests that the nG-based measure is a suitable choice to capture the anharmonic nature of a quantum oscillator, and to quantify its nonlinearity independently of the specific features of the potential. We also provide examples of potentials where the Bures measure cannot be defined, due to the lack of a proper reference harmonic potential, while the nG-based measure properly quantifies their nonlinear features.

We find that the pair-binding energy and the spin gap exhibit a pronounced maximum at intermediate values of t' and U, thus indicating that moderate inhomogeneity of the type considered here substantially enhances the formation of hole pairs. The rise of the pair-binding energy for t'<t'_max is kinetic-energy driven and reflects the strong resonating valence bond correlations in the ground state that facilitate the motion of bound pairs as compared to single holes. Conversely, as t' is increased beyond t'_max antiferromagnetic magnons proliferate and reduce the potential energy of unpaired holes {{and with it the}} pairing strength.

Apart from the Bragg-Compton channel coupling which produces a strong and often irregular background, the main problem in ECOSS has been the low count rate at scattering angles where the impulse approximation is valid. Simula-tions showed that the Gatan 666 PEELS should be capable of producing spectra of sufficient accuracy within a dwell time of some 100 s, when dark current and flat field corrections are applied. Prelimi-nary experiments with Al prove that Compton spectra measured on a Gatan 666 attached to a Philips CM 30 compare well with predicted ones.
