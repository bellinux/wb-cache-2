5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome,</b> an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E

In addition to relative macrocephaly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed severe cerebral atrophy, especially fronto-temporally. The brothers also had a thin corpus callosum and atrophic caudate nuclei. The reduced white matter showed patchy periventricular signal intensity changes. The lateral and third ventricles were large, but the fourth ventricle was of normal size. The boys had large cisterna magna, communicating widely with the fourth ventricle, but no vermian hypoplasia. Both boys had Lennox-Gastaut spectrum type epilepsy. No chromosomal anomalies were found, despite the suggestive clinical picture. Some of the clinical findings resembled <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> effects/fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome</b> (FAE/FAS), which was also suggested by history.

40|$|Abstract — Current {{public health}} {{measures}} to reduce the occurrence of <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> abuse <b>syndrome</b> (FAAS) and <b>alcohol</b> abuse-related birth effects (AARBEs) have been ineffective, because they target alcohol consumption, rather than alcohol abuse. The present discussion contends that the most effective public health strategy for reducing FAAS and AARBEs {{is a combination of}} more specific public health messages that target alcohol abuse, coupled with higher taxes on alcohol beverages. Although alcohol consumption by alcohol abusers has been thought to be inelastic to price changes, recent studies have found that both heavy drinking and binge drinking are sensitive to alcohol price changes, and price elasticities are relatively high for heavy drinkers who are aware of the consequences of their drinking. Although price increases may have a disproportionate impact on lower socioeconomic groups, this article concludes that they are justifiable from both a utilitarian and a categorical imperative perspective...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} wits to {{investigate}} the impact of <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> exposure, maternal depressive symptoms, and low emotional support from the husband on infant irritability in the first one {{and a half years of}} life. Four models describing the interplay of these factors were assessed: A direct effect model, an interaction or threshold model, a mediational model and a transactional model. Method: A sample of initially 458 women was assessed in a prospective 3 -wave study across the first 17 months after childbirth. <b>Fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> exposure was questioned retrospectively six weeks after birth. Infant irritability was reported by the mothers and fathers. Results: Support for the direct effect model and the interaction model could be found: <b>Fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> exposure and low emotional support from the husband were associated with increased infant irritability at 5 months. The impact of <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> exposure was moderated by postnatal depressive symptoms. More irritability was reported if both risk factors, prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal depressive symptoms, were present. Infant irritability and maternal depressive symptoms were associated cross-sectionally. At the age of 17 months only a main effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on irritability could be found. Conclusion: Direct effects of <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> exposure, maternal depressive symptoms, and low emotional support from the husband on infant irritability as well as an interaction between <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> exposure and maternal depressive symptoms were revealed. The interaction can be understood in terms of a diathesis-stress model. However, no longitudinal associations between maternal depressive symptoms and infant irritability could be found...|$|R

25|$|<b>Fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome</b> or FAS is a {{birth defect}} {{that occurs in}} the {{offspring}} of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. Drinking heavily or {{during the early stages}} of prenatal development has been conclusively linked to FAS; moderate consumption is associated with fetal damage. Alcohol crosses the placental barrier and can stunt fetal growth or weight, create distinctive facial stigmata, damaged neurons and brain structures, and cause other physical, mental, or behavioural problems. Fetal alcohol exposure is the leading known cause of intellectual disability in the Western world. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with brain insulin and insulin-like growth factor resistance.|$|E
25|$|Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, {{seeing the}} {{evidence}} as inconclusive {{with respect to}} other types. Partial <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome</b> (pFAS) refers to individuals with a known, or highly suspected, history of prenatal alcohol exposure who have alcohol-related physical and neurodevelopmental deficits that don’t meet the full criteria for FAS. The subtypes of pFAS are alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). In addition to FAS, pFAS, ARND, and ARBD, any other conditions believed {{to be related to}} prenatal alcohol exposure, such as spontaneous abortion and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), are also considered to be on the spectrum of related disorders.

These birth defects and behavioral disorders were found in cases of both long- and short-term paternal alcohol ingestion. In the same animal study, paternal alcohol exposure was correlated with a significant difference in organ size and the increased risk of the offspring displaying ventricular septal defects (VSD) at birth.
