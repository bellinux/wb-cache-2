50|$|After {{the initial}} sales {{figures for the}} digest came in, Marvel {{announced}} a second four-issue miniseries, Mary Jane: Homecoming, which began publication in March 2005. Unlike the first <b>series,</b> <b>Homecoming</b> was not published under the Marvel Age imprint, but as a regular Marvel Comics title, because Marvel Age had by then been restructured into the Marvel Adventures imprint. The second miniseries also saw a slight change in the creative team, as the original miniseries' inker Norman Lee now only inked the covers, while the interior pages were colored straight from Miyazawa's pencils. A second digest, collecting Mary Jane: Homecoming, again sold well enough to justify {{the continuation of the}} series. Following writer McKeever winning an Eisner Award for Talent Deserving of Wider Recognition in summer 2005, Marvel announced that the third series, titled Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane and launching in December 2005, would be an ongoing title and not another miniseries.|$|R
