500|$|J.B. Aspinall's novel Sycorax (2006) {{places the}} origin of the story with a 14th-century peasant woman from Yorkshire. The Indian poet Suniti Namjoshi in Sycorax: New Fables and Poems imagines Sycorax {{returning}} to the island after Prospero and the others have left (including Caliban). Namjoshi has stated, [...] "The Sycorax in my poem is still alive [...] [...] [...] She is still defiant, still fierce, but she is old and knows that death is no longer so far away that it need not be thought of... I wanted to follow Sycorax, keep her company, as <b>it</b> <b>were,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the final moment".|$|E

Yoav Bar was removed from his home {{at four in the morning}} by police and taken to the movement's club in the city. During a search of the premises, [...] " [...] security personnel destroyed the furniture, ripped pictures from the walls, walked on photos of the victims of the Israeli occupation, threw trash, cleaning chemicals, oil, and grease on piles of books and magazines that had been thrown on the floor, and wrote curses and obscenities on the walls. During this time, Yoav Bar was threatened and cursed; one officer told him, 'If <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me, I would shoot you in the head.'" ...|$|E
60|$|There never was, {{since the}} days of Darius, such a {{brilliant}} train of camp-followers as hung round the Duke of Wellington's army in the Low Countries, in 1815; and led it dancing and feasting, as <b>it</b> <b>were,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the very brink of battle. A certain ball which a noble Duchess gave at Brussels on the 15th of June in the above-named year is historical. All Brussels had been in a state of excitement about it, and I have heard from ladies who were in that town at the period, that the talk and interest of persons of their own sex regarding the ball was much greater even than in respect of the enemy in their front. The struggles, intrigues, and prayers to get tickets were such as only English ladies will employ, in order to gain admission to the society of the great of their own nation.|$|E

60|$|I {{doubt if}} any man could tell how any woman was dressed ten minutes {{after he had}} left her. He recollected a blue skirt, {{and then there was}} {{something}} that carried the dress on, as <b>it</b> <b>were,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the neck. Possibly, this may have been a blouse; he retained a dim vision of a belt; but what sort of a blouse? Was it green, or yellow, or blue? Had it a collar, or was it fastened with a bow? Were there feathers in her hat, or flowers? Or was it a hat at all? He dared not say, for fear of making a mistake and being sent miles after the wrong party. The two young women giggled, which in his then state of mind irritated Harris. The young man, who appeared anxious to get rid of him, suggested the police station at the next town. Harris made his way there. The police gave him a piece of paper, and told him to write down a full description of his wife, together with details of when and where he had lost her. He did not know where he had lost her; all he could tell them {{was the name of the}} village where he had lunched. He knew he had her with him then, and that they had started from there together.|$|E
