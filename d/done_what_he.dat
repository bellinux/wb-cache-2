5|$|On Saturday night, Max Mayfield, {{director}} of the National Hurricane Center, did something he had done only once before. He called the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to warn them {{of the severity of}} the coming storm. He issued a special warning to Mayor Ray Nagin, telling him that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News that he went to bed that night believing he had <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W. Bush at his farm in Crawford, Texas about the severity of the storm.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1992, Kosar's {{physical}} decline {{had long}} been apparent to Belichick, which left the coach with a difficult choice. Kosar was Cleveland's most popular athlete, a hometown boy who had forgone big money and a bigger profile to lead a struggling team back to the top. While he recognized {{it would be an}} unpopular decision, Belichick wanted to bench Kosar, and in 1992 the team picked up a potential replacement in Vinny Testaverde from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Belichick named Kosar the starter before the 1993 season, but in the third game against the Raiders, Belichick pulled Kosar after he threw his third interception of the night. Taking over with Los Angeles ahead 13–0, Testaverde led two touchdown drives to win the game. Two weeks later, Belichick named Testaverde the starter. On the verge of tears after a loss to the Dolphins, Kosar said he was disappointed with the decision and felt he had <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could with what was at his disposal.|$|E
25|$|In {{line with}} Park's suggestion, younger {{characters}} were introduced: Nick Tilsley was recast, played by Adam Rickitt, single mother Zoe Tattersall (Joanne Froggatt) first appeared, and the Battersbys moved into No.5. Storylines focussed on tackling 'issues', such as drug dealers, eco-warriors, religious cults, and a transsexual woman. Park quit in 1998, after deciding {{that he had}} <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> intended to do; he maintained that his biggest achievement was the introduction of Hayley Patterson (Julie Hesmondhalgh), the first transsexual character in a British soap.|$|E

500|$|Although {{they were}} locally contentious, the trials boosted Seward's image across the North. He gained further {{publicity}} {{in association with}} Ohioan Salmon P. Chase when handling the unsuccessful appeal in the United States Supreme Court of John Van Zandt, an anti-slavery advocate sued by a slaveowner for assisting African Americans in escaping on the Underground Railroad. Chase was impressed with Seward, writing that the former New York governor [...] "was {{one of the very}} first public men in our country.

Lassie then dashed off to get help or rushed in to save her master's life herself. After being reunited with family and {{breathing}} a sigh of relief, the boy received a light lecture on why he should not have <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done.

An angry-looking Yemi replies, [...] "You speak to me as if I were your brother" [...] as he retreats into the jungle. Eko follows him asking [...] "Who are you?!", and then finds the smoke monster. An arm of smoke attacks Eko, beating him into trees before he is slammed into the ground. Locke and the others rush out of the station to find a bloodied Eko. Locke {{approaches}} Eko, who whispers his dying words into Locke's ears. Sayid asks what he said, and Locke replies, [...] "We're next." ...|$|E
500|$|Adams had {{his first}} {{audience}} with King George III on June 1, and recorded the event {{as he saw it}} in great detail in a letter to Foreign Minister John Jay on June 2. Adams approached the King, telling him that he felt greatly honored by his appointment, and promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality [...] "between People who, tho Seperated by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood." [...] After hearing this, King George, promised to [...] "receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States." [...] He added that [...] "while he had been the last to consent" [...] to American independence, he wished Adams to know that he had always <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought right and proper. Towards the end of the interview, the King said, which to Adams appeared very sudden, [...] "There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France." [...] Adams replied, [...] "That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country." [...] To this King George responded, [...] "An honest Man will never have any other." ...|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalised}} rating out of 100to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, Morning/Evening received an average score of 77 based on 17reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Exclaim! reviewer Chad Barnes called it [...] "a gorgeous, daring album", saying that [...] "Hebden spins intricate sonic gold while subtly exploring {{a range of}} moods and moments on the complex, constantly morphing compositions". Kitty Empire, writing for The Observer, {{said that it was}} a [...] "low key treat" [...] that contained [...] "effortless prettiness." [...] Pitchfork Media reviewer Andy Beta called the album [...] "daring and expansive" [...] and said that [...] "the scope and ambition of Morning/Evening is profound, and will hopefully inspire producers to take bigger chances and not be satisfied with pop- or club-friendly lengths." [...] NME called [...] "Morning Side" [...] "one of the most moving pieces of music Hebden has ever put his name to" [...] and said the album ranked [...] "alongside Four Tet's very best work." [...] Critic Nina Corcoran of Consequence of Sound said that [...] "Hebden has <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> does best: create an atmosphere so encompassing that you lose sight of wherever you are while you're listening".

500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, when {{psychoanalysis}} was at the height of its influence, its concepts were applied to Hamlet, notably by Sigmund Freud, Ernest Jones, and Jacques Lacan, and these studies influenced theatrical productions. In his The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), Freud's analysis starts from the premise that [...] "the play is built up on Hamlet's hesitations over fulfilling the task of revenge that is assigned to him; but its text offers no reasons or motives for these hesitations". After reviewing various literary theories, Freud concludes that Hamlet has an [...] "Oedipal desire for his mother and the subsequent guilt [...] preventing him from murdering the man [...] who has <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> unconsciously wanted to do". Confronted with his repressed desires, Hamlet realises that [...] "he himself is literally no better than the sinner whom he is to punish". Freud suggests that Hamlet's apparent [...] "distaste for sexuality"—articulated in his [...] "nunnery" [...] conversation with Ophelia—accords with this interpretation. John Barrymore's long-running 1922 performance in New York, directed by Thomas Hopkins, [...] "broke new ground in its Freudian approach to character", in keeping with the post-World War I rebellion against everything Victorian. He had a [...] "blunter intention" [...] than presenting the genteel, sweet prince of 19th-century tradition, imbuing his character with virility and lust.|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte von Kirschbaum was Barth's {{secretary}} and theological assistant {{for more than}} three decades. When Barth first met her in 1924 he had already been married for 12 years and, in 1929, she moved into the Barth family household, which included his wife Nelly and five children. George Hunsinger summarizes the influence of von Kirschbaum on Barth's work: [...] "As his unique student, critic, researcher, adviser, collaborator, companion, assistant, spokesperson, and confidante, Charlotte von Kirschbaum was indispensable to him. He could not have been what he was, or have <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did, without her." ...|$|E

[...] Mindful of the Proclamation of Rebellion, he {{immediately}} reported the matter to his commanding officer, who took him to Rochford. [...] With the opening of Parliament fast approaching, Rochford decided to act, though he was initially concerned that the evidence was not strong enough. [...] On Monday, 23 October, Sayre was arrested on a charge of high treason. [...] His papers were searched, and he was then taken to Rochford's office, where he denied all knowledge of the alleged plot. [...] After this, he was committed to the Tower, while Rochford did his best to uncover some form of corroboration. [...] By now the London press had got hold of the story, and immediately dismissed the whole thing as a political farce. [...] Sayre had been arrested, so it was reported, [...] "upon an Information so romantic, so foolish, so absurd, that if they thought the Accused could have <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was charged with, he ought to have been committed to Bedlam, not the Tower." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asquith's {{reputation}} {{will always}} be heavily influenced by his downfall {{at the height of}} the First World War. In 1930, Basil Liddell Hart summed up opinion as to the reasons for his fall; [...] "Lloyd George (came to) power as the spokesman for a widespread demand for a more vigorous as well as a more efficient prosecution of the war." [...] Asquith's collegiate approach; his tendency to [...] "wait and see;" [...] his stance as the chairman of the cabinet, rather than leader of a government—"content to preside without directing;" [...] his [...] "contempt for the press, regard(ing) journalists as ignorant, spiteful and unpatriotic;" [...] and his weakness for alcohol—"I had occasion to speak to the P.M. twice yesterday and on both occasions I was nearly gassed by the alcoholic fumes he discharged;" [...] all contributed to a prevailing sense that Asquith was unable to rise to [...] "the necessities of total warfare." [...] Grigg concludes, [...] "In certain vital respects, he was not qualified to run the war. A great head of government in peacetime, by the end of 1916 he was in a general state of decline, his obvious defects as a war leader (exposed)." [...] Cassar, reflecting on Asquith's work to bring a united country to war, and his efforts in the year thereafter, goes towards a reassessment; [...] "His achievements are sufficiently impressive to earn him a place as one of the outstanding figures of the Great War" [...] His contemporary opponent, Lord Birkenhead paid tribute to his bringing Britain united into the War, [...] ""A statesman who rendered great service to his country at a time when no other living Englishman could have <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did." [...] The Coalition Whip, William Bridgeman, provided an alternative Tory view, comparing Lloyd George to Asquith at the time of the latter's fall; [...] "however unpopular or mistrusted (Lloyd George) was in the House, he carried much more weight in the Country than Asquith, who was almost everywhere looked on as a lazy and dilatory man." [...] Sheffield and Bourne provide a recent historical reassessment; [...] "Asquith's governments arguably took all the key decisions of the War: the decision to intervene, to send the BEF; to raise a mass volunteer army; to start and end the Gallipoli Campaign; the creation of a Coalition government; the mobilisation of industry; the introduction of conscription." [...] But the weight of opinion continues to agree with Asquith's own candid assessment, in a letter written in the midst of war in July 1916; [...] "I am (as usual) encompassed by a cloud of worries, anxieties, problems and the rest. 'The time is out of joint' and sometimes I am tempted to say with Hamlet 'O cursed spite, that ever I was born to set it right.' Perhaps I wasn't." ...|$|E
