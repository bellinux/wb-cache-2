50|$|Cultural {{differences}} in coping strategies other than social support also exist.

Further, <b>European</b> <b>Americans</b> are more likely to exercise in order to cope than Koreans. Some cultural explanations are that Asians are less likely to seek it from fear of disrupting the harmony of their relationships and that they are more inclined to settle their problems independently and avoid criticism.

5|$|Members of the Desert Archaic Culture {{were the}} {{earliest}} known inhabitants of the region; an archaeological site found along the river dates back 3,000 years.

In return, the Monos tracked down and killed many of the remaining Ahwahneechee, including Tenaya; Tenaya Lake is named after the fallen chief.

Between 1853 and 1855, many Native Americans were killed and their villages destroyed in skirmishes occurring around {{the same time as the}} nearby Rogue River Wars.

Resources depended upon by local Native Americans were depleted or destroyed, and disease brought by the newcomers spread rapidly through indigenous populations. Extermination of native culture became a policy of the United States Government.|$|E
5|$|Great Barrington had a {{majority}} <b>European</b> <b>American</b> community, who treated Du Bois generally well.

But teachers recognized his ability and encouraged his intellectual pursuits, and his rewarding experience with academic studies led him to believe that he could use his knowledge to empower African Americans. Du Bois graduated from the town's Searles High School. When Du Bois decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the First Congregational Church of Great Barrington, raised the money for his tuition.Horne, p. 7.Lewis, pp. 39–40.|$|E

5|$|The area rapidly {{changed from}} <b>European</b> <b>American</b> to African-American in the 1920s. By 1930, the {{population}} was only 7.8% white. By 1960, {{the population was}} 0.5% white. From 1950 to 2000 {{the total population of}} the neighborhood declined from 57,000 to 14,146. This population decline is partly due to initiatives of the Chicago Land Clearance Commission, who acted under the 1955 Amendment to the Blighted Areas Redevelopment Act, which empowered redevelopment authorities that have acquired land by condemnation or otherwise to redevelop such lands for non-residential uses. A good example of the Land Clearing commission activities is the Lake Meadows Park to the north of Washington Park. The failure of the evolution of industry and commerce in the community, the above-mentioned white flight and land redevelopment for non-residential use combined lead to population decline.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>European</b> <b>American</b> {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} Chingleclamouche Township in about 1793, {{and the first}} sawmill in Clearfield County began operating in 1805. Settlers initially occupied land along the river and creeks, as these provided a means of transportation. Some settlers would harvest timber and float it downstream once a year to make money for items they could not produce themselves, but by 1820 the first full-time lumbering operations began in the region. The white pine was the most sought after tree, yielding spars for ships and timber for buildings. Hardwoods were also harvested, and eventually hemlocks were cut for their wood and their bark, which contained tannins used in tanning leather.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19thcentury, the <b>European</b> <b>American</b> {{newcomers}} had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley were among the new communities that grew up along the line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{rates of}} interracial {{cohabitation}} are {{significantly higher than}} those of marriage.

Of cohabiting Asian men, slightly over 37% of Asian men have white female partners and over 10% married to white women.
