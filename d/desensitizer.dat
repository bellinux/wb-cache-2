We hypothesized that total-etch adhesives can, depending upon their pH, interact with oxalate-desensitizer-treated dentin in an adverse manner. Acid-etched human dentin treated with 2 oxalate <b>desensitizers</b> (BisBlock and Super Seal) was bonded with 4 simplified total-etch adhesives: One-Step (OS), Single Bond (SB), OptiBond Solo Plus (OB), and Prime&Bond NT (PB). Composite-dentin beams were examined by SEM and TEM, both of which revealed numerous spherical globules on OB- and PB-bonded, desensitizer-treated dentin, but not in OS or SB samples. Bond strengths produced by OB and PB were significantly lower in oxalate-treated specimens than those produced by OS or SB.

Human third molars (N= 880) were embedded in acrylic resin. The buccal dentin was exposed. Teeth were randomly divided into four main groups, and the following cements were adhered: 1) RelyX ARC, 2) Panavia 21, 3) RelyX Unicem, and 4) G-Cem. In half of the teeth in each group, dentin was treated with Gluma <b>Desensitizer.</b> In the conventional cement groups, the corresponding etchant and adhesive systems were applied. SBS of the cements was tested after 1 hour (initial); at 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25 days of water storage; and at 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25 days of thermocycling. SBS data were analyzed by {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA); this was followed by the post hoc Scheffé test and a t-test. Overall, the highest mean SBS (MPa) was obtained by RelyX ARC (ranging from 14. 6 ± 3. 9 to 17. 6 ± 5. 2) and the lowest by Panavia 21 in combination with Gluma <b>Desensitizer</b> (ranging from 0. 0 to 2. 9 ± 1. 0).

5000|$|Siderovski was {{the first}} to report the cloning and {{sequencing}} of a cDNA encoding an RGS protein family member: 'G0/G1-switch gene-8' or G0S8 (subsequently renamed RGS2); this cloning and sequencing work was conducted as a Queen's University undergraduate student in the Biochemistry laboratory of Dr. Donald R. Forsdyke. [...] Before the discovery of RGS proteins, the duration of heterotrimeric G-protein signaling was thought to be modulated by only two factors: the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of the Gα subunit and acceleration of that rate by some specialized Gα effectors (i.e., phospholipase C-beta isoforms). What Siderovski originally identified as the G0S8-homology ("GH") domain in proteins from several eukaryotic genomes (human, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is now known as the [...] "RGS domain", an approximately 130 amino-acid domain that contacts the Gα switch regions to stabilize the transition state, thus accelerating GTP hydrolysis (i.e., RGS proteins act as GTPase-accelerating proteins or “GAPs” for Gα-GTP; e.g., ref.). Discovery of a superfamily of RGS domain-containing proteins that negatively regulate Gα-dependent signaling resolved a prior paradox that GPCR-stimulated signals are seen to terminate much faster in vivo than predicted from the slow GTP hydrolysis rates exhibited by purified Gα subunits in vitro. RGS proteins are now considered key <b>desensitizers</b> of heterotrimeric G protein signaling and, as such, as new drug discovery targets. This foundational work by Siderovski on a new class of GPCR signaling regulators has been cited over 17,000 times according to Google Scholar and also resulted in Siderovski editing a two-volume set of Methods in Enzymology chapters devoted to these regulatory proteins.|$|R

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 56 teeth in 14 patients with Miller's class 1 and 2 gingival recession with clinically elicitable dentin hypersensitivity (DH). The patients were divided into two groups: a Nd:YAG-laser-treated group and a 685 -nm diode laser-treated group. DH was assessed by means of an air stimulus, and a visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure DH. The selected teeth in the two groups received laser therapy for three sessions. Teeth subjected to Nd:YAG-laser treatment were irradiated at 1 [*]W and 10 [*]Hz for 60 [*]sec at 1064 [*]nm, and those receiving 685 -nm diode laser treatment were irradiated at 25 [*]mW and 9 [*]Hz for 100 [*]sec. Results: Significant reductions in DH occurred at all time points measured during the three treatment sessions in both treatment groups. Comparing the means of the responses in the three treatment sessions for the two groups revealed that the Nd:YAG laser group had a higher degree of desensitization compared to the other group (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). The immediate and late therapeutic effects of the Nd:YAG laser were more evident than those of the 685 -nm diode laser.

Methods: The test materials were inserted in the wells of Muller Hinton agar plates inoculated with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarious, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The diameters of the inhibition zones produced around the materials were measured after 24 h of incubation. The results were analyzed by the Kruskal Wallis one way ANOVA and the Mann-Whitney tests at a significance level of P<. 05. Results: Micro Prime <b>Desensitizer</b> containing benzalkonium chloride had the highest antibacterial effectiveness compared to other desensitizers used in this study. In addition, triclosan containing Seal & Protect and acidic components containing All Bond showed very high antibacterial efficacy. On the other hand, fluoride within both varnishes had little antibacterial effectiveness. However a fluoride component in a paste (Sultan <b>Desensitizer)</b> showed very high bactericidal effect. Conclusions: All desensitizers except fluoride varnishes showed various degrees of antibacterial effect against the bacteria tested in this study. If antibacterial effect is also required from the desensitizers ’ clinicians should avoid use of varnishes. (Eur J Dent 2008; 2 : 43 - 47...|$|E
40|$|Context: Dentin desensitizers {{are used}} for in-office {{treatment}} of dentinal hypersensitivity. They block the open tubules and bring about a reduction in hypersensitivity. Aim: The aim was to evaluate and compare the clinical effectiveness of a dentin <b>desensitizer,</b> {{a combination of a}} dentin <b>desensitizer</b> + adhesive and one-bottle self-etching adhesive for in-office treatment of dentin hypersensitivity. Settings and Design: Institutional, prospective double-blind parallel clinical design. Subjects and Methods: A total of 54 teeth in 20 patients were randomly allocated to one of the three study groups, with 18 teeth in each group as follows: Group A-Gluma <b>Desensitizer</b> (GD), Group B-Gluma Comfort Bond + <b>Desensitizer</b> (GCBD), Group C-Single Bond Universal (SBU). The patients′ dentinal hypersensitivity scores for tactile (hand-held scratch device), thermal (cold), and evaporative (dental unit air syringe) stimuli were recorded on a visual analog scale. The parameters were recorded at baseline, immediately after application of the agent, 3 - and 6 -week posttreatment. Statistical Analysis Used: The data were analyzed with Friedman′s test, Wilcoxon signed ranks test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Mann-Whitney-U-test (P < 0. 05). Results: All three groups showed a significant reduction in dentinal hypersensitivity (P < 0. 05) compared to baseline at all time intervals. Statistically, significant differences were noted between GD and SBU; between GCBD and SBU in all testing parameters. Between GD and GCBD no significant difference was noted. Conclusions: GD and GCBD showed a greater reduction in dentin hypersensitivity than SB...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was {{evaluate}} the effect of application of synthetic hydroxyapatite on fiber post bond strength to radicular dentine. Forty, single-root teeth were endodontically treated and an 8 mm post space was prepared. Specimens were randomly placed in four groups (n = 10 in each) and treated using the following fiber post luting procedures: group 1, 17 % EDTA + Panavia SA; group 2, 17 % EDTA + Teethmate <b>Desensitizer</b> + Panavia SA; group 3, All-Bond Universal + Duo-Link Universal; and group 4, All-Bond Universal + Teethmate <b>Desensitizer</b> + Duo-Link Universal. Fiber posts were luted in the post space and light-cured for 120 s using a light-emitting diode (LED) lamp. After 7 d of storage at 37 °C, the teeth were cut into 1 -mm-thick slices, which were subjected to a push-out test until failure using a universal testing machine. Two specimens per group were prepared for scanning electron microscopy analysis. An energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector was used for elemental analysis of the specimen surface. The results were statistically analyzed using one-way anova. The fiber post bond strength was statistically significantly increased after the application of Teethmate <b>Desensitizer</b> to post space walls, either with a 10 -MDP-containing self-adhesive cement or with a universal adhesive. Scanning electron microscopy and EDAX analysis showed that Teethmate <b>Desensitizer</b> created a calcium phosphate precipitate over post space dentinal tubules, which significantly improved the bond strength of the fiber post luted with 10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (10 -MDP) -containing adhesive systems...|$|E
40|$|A hiperestesia dentinÃria Ã um fenÃmeno sensorial complexo e de difÃcil soluÃÃo na clÃnica odontolÃgica. Apesar da grande diversidade de tratamentos propostos, ainda nÃo existe uma terapia considerada ideal para eliminar essa situaÃÃo desconfortÃvel. Esta dissertaÃÃo, constituÃda por dois artigos cientÃficos, teve por objetivos: (1) revisar criticamente a {{literatura}} disponÃvel sobre os principais aspectos relacionados Ã etiologia e ao tratamento da hiperestesia dentinÃria; (2) avaliar clinicamente a eficiÃncia de agentes anti-hiperestÃsicos no tratamento da hiperestesia dentinÃria. No estudo 1, a literatura cientÃfica pertinente ao assunto foi analisada atravÃs dos resultados de investigaÃÃes clÃnicas e laboratoriais pesquisadas usando a base de dados medline e busca manual de referÃncias citadas em artigos cientÃficos. No estudo 2, um total de 164 dentes, provenientes de 30 pacientes com diagnÃstico de hiperestesia dentinÃria moderada ou severa, foi dividido aleatoriamente em trÃs grupos e avaliado clinicamente de acordo com o tratamento administrado: aplicaÃÃo de laser de arseniato de gÃlio-alumÃnio (AsGaAl), aplicaÃÃo de gel de oxalato de potÃssio a 3 % e aplicaÃÃo de gel placebo. As aplicaÃÃes dos tratamentos foram realizadas em intervalos semanais, durante o perÃodo de quatro semanas consecutivas e o grau de sensibilidade foi mensurado para cada dente atravÃs de uma escala visual analÃgica em resposta aos estÃmulos tÃtil (sonda exploradora) e evaporativo (jato de ar) antes da primeira aplicaÃÃo (baseline), imediatamente apÃs e trÃs meses apÃs a Ãltima aplicaÃÃo dos tratamentos. Os dados foram submetidos Ã anÃlise estatÃstica pelo teste de Kruskal-Wallis (p= 0, 05) e o grau de reduÃÃo da hiperestesia dentinÃria foi avaliado para cada um dos perÃodos observacionais em relaÃÃo ao baseline. A anÃlise crÃtica apresentada no artigo 1 mostrou que a literatura apresenta diversos tipos de tratamento para a hiperestesia dentinÃria, que variam desde procedimentos simples, que podem ser executados pelo prÃprio paciente, atÃ procedimentos complexos, que envolvem a combinaÃÃo de diferentes terapias. Os resultados do artigo 2 demonstraram que a aplicaÃÃo dos tratamentos propostos, inclusive o placebo, proporcionou reduÃÃo estatisticamente significante, imediata e mediata, da sensibilidade em resposta aos estÃmulos tÃtil e evaporativo (p 0, 05). Em conclusÃo, os resultados desses estudos indicam que o conhecimento acerca do mecanismo de ocorrÃncia da hiperestesia dentinÃria e dos agentes anti-hiperestÃsicos disponÃveis Ã indispensÃvel para a elaboraÃÃo de um tratamento eficiente. AlÃm disso, concluiu-se que os trÃs tratamentos utilizados no estudo clÃnico sÃo eficientes para a reduÃÃo da hiperestesia dentinÃria e que existe grande influÃncia do efeito placebo na reduÃÃo da sensibilidade dolorosaDentinal hypersensitivity is {{a complex}} sensorial condition which can cause considerable concern in the dental office. Despite {{the large number of}} different proposed kinds of treatment, there is no product or therapy reported in literature that could be considered ideal to eliminate this uncomfortable situation. The aim of this study, comprised by two manuscripts, was: (1) to critically review the literature related to the main evidences about the etiology and the management of dentinal hypersensitivity; (2) to evaluate the clinical performance of different dentine <b>desensitizers</b> in the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity. In study 1, the scientific literature related to the issue was analyzed through the results of laboratory and clinical investigations searched using medline and manual tracing of references cited scientific papers. In study 2, a total of 164 teeth, from 30 patients with clinical diagnosis of moderate or severe dentinal hypersensitivity, were randomly divided into three groups and clinically evaluated according to the desensitizing treatment under study: gallium-aluminun-arsenide (GaAlAs) laser therapy, 3 % potassium oxalate application and placebo gel application. Treatment sessions were performed at seven-day intervals for four consecutive weeks and the degree of sensitivity in response to tactile (probe) and evaporative (air blast) stimuli was assessed according to a visual analogue scale at baseline, immediately after and three months after the last treatment session. Data scores were submitted to Kruskal-Wallis statistical analysis (p= 0. 05) and were analyzed by dentinal hypersensitivity reduction for each observational moment in relation to baseline. The critical review presented in study 1 showed that the reviewed literature points out several treatment modalities ranging from simple procedures, which can be performed by the patient him/herself, to complex procedures that involve the combination of therapies. The results of study 2 demonstrated that the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity performed with both active and control groups produced statistically significant reduction of pain in response to evaporative and tactile stimulation immediately after and three months after treatment (p 0. 05). In conclusion, the results of these studies suggest that knowledge about the available desensitizing products and the factors involved in the mechanism of the dentinal hypersensitivity is indispensable in order to perform an effective treatment. Besides, it could be concluded that the three treatments performed in the clinical study were effective for treating dentinal hypersensitivity and that the placebo effect {{plays an important role in}} sensitivity reductio...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and Objective: Dentin Hypersensitivity (DH) {{is one of}} {{the common}} oral {{conditions}} that affect adult population and defined as a short, sharp pain arising from exposed dentin in response to stimuli typically thermal, evaporative, tactile, osmotic or chemical and cannot ascribe to any other form of dental pathology or disease. DH development through two distinct but interrelated phases of tooth wear and gingival recession associated with different etiological factors. Morphological alterations in DH and intradental nerve excitability are the underlying sources that lead to disease progression, pain evocation as well as therapeutic strategies investigations to interrupt pain transmission. Numerous treatment modalities have been used to manage DH. The interventions of DH have been classified based on the mode of delivery (in-office or professionally-applied therapy and over-the-counter (OTC) or at- home therapy). The other classification used based on the mechanism of action and could be divided into two main categories: the dentinal tubules occluding agents to block the hydrodynamic mechanism of pain stimulation and the nerve <b>desensitizers</b> to interrupt the neural response to pain stimuli (neural blocker). The main objective for any dentine-desensitizing agent is to produce a clinically significant reduction in clinical symptoms and minimize or abolish the symptoms of pain or discomfort associated with DH. The variety of products and techniques used for the treatment of DH indicated a doubt among dentists about the best treatment option, as well as dissatisfaction with outcomes of available treatments, which necessitate the conduction of a comparative effectiveness research and a practice analysis to provide dentists and patients with precise scientific information for comparing the effectiveness and safety of alternative treatment options in resolving DH among different available treatment. The aim of the study is to conduct a comparative effectiveness research to find out if In-office desensitizing agents with dentinal tubules occlusion mechanism of action are more effective than self-applied desensitizing toothpaste with a neural stimulus blocker mechanism of action in resolving dentin hypersensitivity. Methods: Search for systematic reviews, randomized clinical trials and observational studies were done using the National Library of Medicine-PubMed, Cochrane’s library and the American Dental Association (ADA) web Library. The relevance of the identified systematic reviews, clinical trials and observational studies to the study and PICOTS question was assessed using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of evidence and clinical relevance analysis achieved using validated and reliable instruments by two independent readers, and all disagreements resolved by discussion after establishing the inter-rater reliability of the two readers. The revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (R-AMSTAR) instrument utilized to assess and quantify the quality of retained systematic reviews, the quantified Risk of Bias instrument utilized to evaluate the quality of retained clinical trials and the Expansion in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (Ex-GRADE) was used to evaluate the clinical relevance and the strength of recommendation. Acceptable sampling analysis was done using the Friedman test statistics. Meta-analysis was done on the two highest quality and homogenous clinical trials. Results: Three out of six systematic reviews were considered as high-quality studies and two out of thirty-one clinical trials were considered as high-quality studies. However, the bibliome was concerned with a body of literature that has a considerable heterogeneity in terms of quality of the evidence, which prevented further work toward establishing the quantitative and qualitative consensus of the best evidence. Therefore, an alternative approach for acceptable sampling was conducted. Whereby the top 20 % highest scoring papers in the bibliome were accepted. So, out of thirty-one studies, seven studies included and considered as high-quality studies. The results of the qualitative analysis of this review shows that 5 % potassium nitrate toothpaste has inferior effectiveness in DH management as at home intervention, however, the reduction in the hypersensitivity increase with each recall that suggests the slow effectiveness that could be explained by the requisite of maintaining a high level of potassium nitrate to reach the maximum effectiveness. 5 % potassium was not effective compared to in-office desensitizing intervention. Although it is difficult to prove or reach a conclusive evidence of the best treatment option, treatment approaches with resin-based composite restoration and glass ionomer liner resulted in statistically significant reduction in sensitivity. Yet, the complicated procedure of application of these restorations might be considered in terms of time and cost in treating dentin hypersensitivity. Furthermore, it considered as technique sensitive owing to the tendency to perform an overhang at the gingival margins, which {{contribute to the development of}} gingivitis or jeopardize the biological width of the periodontal tissues. Gluma and fluoride varnishes were effective in reducing DH for up to 6 months with no reported adverse effects aside to the time and cost consideration. Conclusion: Based on the qualitative analysis of this review, the 5 % potassium nitrate toothpaste has inferior effectiveness in DH management as at home intervention, which was not effective compared to in-office desensitizing interventions. Resin-based composite restoration and glass ionomer liner as in-office interventions yielded statistically significant reduction in sensitivity. However, the complicated procedure of application of these restorations might be considered in terms of time and cost in treating dentin hypersensitivity, which suggest that Gluma and fluoride varnishes might be superior treatment options in reducing DH in terms of efficacy and effectiveness. This review highlights the extent of heterogeneity and quality inferiority of clinical trials in this field, which impact the degree of their reliability. Also, it necessitates the future conduction of well-constructed clinical trials that directed to overcome current deficiencies and weaknesses...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} a dicalcium and tetracalcium phosphate-based <b>desensitizer</b> in reducing dentin permeability in vitro. Dentin fluid flow was measured before and after treatment of dentin with patent dentinal tubules using 1 or 3 applications of the dicalcium and tetracalcium phosphate containing agent TeethmateTM (TM) and comparing the results with two sodium fluoride varnishes VellaTM (VLA) and VanishTM (VAN), after storage in artificial saliva for 24 h, 48 h and 7 days. Significant differences were observed among the 4 methods employed for reducing dentin permeability (p < 0. 001) and the 3 post-treatment times (p < 0. 001). VLA and VAN never achieved 50 % permeability reductions consistently in any of the 3 time periods. Only the calcium phosphate-based <b>desensitizer</b> applied for 3 times consistently reduced dentin permeability by 50 % after 24 h. When applied once, the permeability reduction of TM increased progressively over the 3 time periods. After 7 days, only one and three applications of the calcium phosphate-based <b>desensitizer</b> consistently reduced dentin permeability by more than 50 %. Permeability reductions corresponded well with scanning electron microscopy examination of dentinal tubule orifice occlusion in dentin specimens treated with the agents. Overall, the dicalcium and tetracalcium phosphate-based <b>desensitizer</b> is effective in reducing dentin permeability via a tubule occlusion mechanism. The ability of the agent to reduce dentin permeability renders it to be potentially useful as a clinical dentin desensitizing agent, which has to be confirmed in future clinical studies. By contrast, the two sodium fluoride varnishes are not effective in dentin permeability reduction and should be considered as topical fluoride delivering agents rather than tubular orifice-blocking agents...|$|E
