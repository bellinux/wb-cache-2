The Fish and Game Board hired its first state game warden, R.A. Wagner, in July 1898. Hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>licenses</b> were imposed on out-of-state residents in 1901.

The Fish and Game commissioners recommended the establishment of a Fish and Game Department, and the legislature created this agency on April 1, 1901.

25|$|First hand, the Detroit River {{provides}} {{a substantial amount}} of revenue for the local economies. A study in 1991 showed that $20.1 million came from sales related to waterfowl hunting along the Detroit River. During the same year, bird watching, photography, and other non-consumptive uses of waterfowl contributed an additional $192.8 million to Michigan’s economy. Local economies benefit through boating registrations and <b>fishing</b> <b>licenses.</b> It is estimated that walleye fishing alone brings in $1 million to the economy of communities along the lower Detroit River each spring.

A percentage of the tourist revenue depends on the Detroit River, which is the most noticeable environmental feature in Detroit. Popular river destinations in the city of Detroit include the Detroit International Riverfront and Belle Isle Park — both of which host a number of events throughout the year. Several restaurants on the river have dock facilities for boaters. Tour boats and dinner cruises travel through the sights of Detroit and the undeveloped islands downriver.
