50|$|The {{reaction}} timing can {{be further}} controlled by addition of other substances. As the diffusion rate of oxygen through the polymer layer {{is more or less}} constant, a supply of suitable antioxidants (e.g. organometallic compounds) which react with the oxygen preferentially to the leuco dye leads to gradual depletion of the antioxidant compound. Only after the antioxidant is consumed, the leuco dye starts being oxidized, achieving the period of delay of the reaction onset, followed by a rapid reflectivity degradation. Stannous <b>ethylhexanoate</b> can be used here as the antioxidant organometallic. Various resin-soluble tin(II) and iron(II) compounds can be used, e.g. chelates and fatty acid salts. Other usable compounds are e.g. hydroquinones, alkylhydroxylamines, dithionates, reducing saccharides (e.g. glucose), α-hydroxyketones (e.g., hydroxyacetone), substituted boron hydrides and silicon hydrides.|$|E

40|$|In {{the light}} of {{increasing}} rates of nutrition related diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, {{high blood pressure and}} stroke it is necessary to reduce sugar, salt and fat contents of industrial produced food. Reduction of those components generally leads to changes of the sensory properties of the products and rejection by the consumer. Traditional compensation strategies like the use of taste enhancers, artificial sweeteners or fat replacers often lead to off-flavours and consequently to consumer rejection. This thesis describes cross-modal interactions as an alternative strategy to reduce sugar, salt and fat. In the past cross-modal interactions have been describe to influence taste and texture perception, however up to now research focused on simple model systems lacking in perceptual, as well as chemical complexity. This thesis aimed on the application of cross modal interactions involving aroma modification to complex food systems, such as apple juice and cheese. It was investigated whether aromas are able to modify taste perception in complex food matrices and what the driving factors are to which extend aromas can enhance taste perception. Furthermore different cross modal approaches were combined in order to investigate possible additive or synergistic effects on taste enhancement. At first, the question whether individual aroma components can be identified that have the capacity to enhance taste perception in a complex beverage was addressed [chapter 2]. Apple juice was choosen to represent a complex matrix where interactions between taste and aroma are a natural product characteristic. <b>Ethylhexanoate</b> was identified to significantly enhance sweetness in apple juice, while three other esters selected on the same basis did not show sweetness enhancement. <b>Ethylhexanoate</b> induced sweetness enhancement appeared to be concentration dependent. Concentrations of 5 ppm were found to be most effective to enhance sweetness in this specific system. However, next to sweetness undesired attributes such as flowery and synthetic were also increased significantly. As a conclusion it has to be noticed that flavour balance in complex food is fragile and has to be carefully altered in order to use odour induced taste enhancement as a tool in sugar, salt and fat reduction. Chapter 3 describes the masking of off-flavours induced by <b>ethylhexanoate</b> as described in chapter 2. It was hypothesised that <b>ethylhexanoate</b> induced off-flavours can be masked by restoring flavour balance by equally adding combinations of all four esters. A combination of <b>ethylhexanoate,</b> ethylbutanoate and ethyl- 2 -methylbutanoate was found to be most effective to restore flavour quality while maintaining <b>ethylhexanoate</b> induced sweetness enhancement. It was concluded that all components that are naturally part of an aroma are needed to achieve a balanced product. Optimisation of odour presentation time in order to achieve maximum taste enhancement was subject to the study described in chapter 4. Swallowing is the key to aroma release during food consumption. It was demonstrated that aroma is most presented most effectively either 1. 7 – 2. 5 seconds before or 2. 6 – 3. 6 seconds after the moment of swallow. Aroma presented directly at the moment of swallow was found to be least effective to enhance taste. It is assumed that olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) do not transmit the activation signal to the brain at the exact moment of swallow in order to spare energy and function most effective, as during normal food consumption the aroma is released shortly after swallowing. This hypothesis was further tested in an fMRI study. Preliminary results support this theory, however at the moment of completion of this thesis data evaluation was still in progress. In chapter 5 further optimisation of odour/taste interactions was studied, by investigating the influence of temperature on odour induced taste enhancement. Consumption temperatures differ strongly among products. As aroma release strongly depends on the temperature of the food, it was hypothesised that the magnitude of aroma effects on taste perception changes over consumption temperature. Subjects consumed a sweet and a savoury system at four different temperatures (7, 25, 37 and 50 °C). Stimuli temperature and odour presentation were fully controlled by temperature optimised gustometry and olfactometry. Both aroma/taste systems were known to have induced taste enhancement in the past (sweet: apple flavoured tea/ethylhexanoate; savoury: broth/sotolon). No significant effect of temperature was found for either of the stimulus pairs. Results indicate that the complexity of the experiment led to confusion by the panelists under fully randomised stimuli delivery conditions. It was therefore concluded, that temperature effects on the magnitude of odour induced taste enhancement need to be studied in a reduced experimental design. Temporal contrast as a strategy to enhance salty taste was studied in the experiments described in chapter 6. Salty solutions of different NaCl concentrations were presented in alternating sequence by a gustometer, creating a sensory contrast of low-in salt and high-in salt pulses. It was demonstrated that the sensory contrast induced by the pulsed delivery led to significant taste enhancement. It was shown that high concentrations of NaCl delivered in short pulses were most effective to enhance salty taste. It was concluded that pulsed stimulus delivery can be an additional tool to reduce salt and sugar concentrations in industrial produced food. Chapter 7 combines both cross-modal strategies to enhance taste in this thesis so far, odour induced taste enhancement and temporal contrast of stimulus delivery. Subjects were presented with taste and aroma pulses timed via a gustometer. The aroma was either presented in-phase or out-of-phase with the taste stimulus. A cumulative effect of aroma/taste interactions and temporal contrast of tastant delivery was found, resulting in higher taste enhancement than each of the strategies alone. Overall highest sweetness enhancement was observed when aroma and taste pulses were presented out-of-phase. Texture modification is a third cross-modal strategy to enhance taste perception. Combinatory effects of texture modification and odour induced taste enhancement are subject to the study reported in chapter 8. Apple juice containing gels were engineered differing in textural properties, aroma and sugar concentration. In contrast to the results presented in chapter 7, only an additive but no synergistic effect was found for those strategies. Texture modification was found to be more effective than aroma modification. Chapter 9 studies effects of aroma on the taste and the texture of cheese and dairy model gels. In the first study subjects consumed different types of cheese with and without a nose-clip. This way the contribution of the aroma phase on the flavour and texture perception of cheese was studied. Saltiness was influenced significantly by the aroma. It was concluded that the aroma of cheese strongly contributes to a cheeses salty taste. Furthermore it was observed that a decrease in cheese firmness strongly correlated with an increase in buttery aroma notes. This was further studied in fully controlled dairy model gels. For gels tasting of cream cheese a significant decrease in firmness was found upon increasing aroma concentration. No effect of butter aroma on firmness was found for yoghurt-like gels. This once more demonstrates the importance of congruency between stimuli. Only congruent sensory impressions can influence each other. In addition, an increase in creaminess was observed with increasing aroma concentration. The results described in chapter 9 clearly show that aromas cannot only modify taste perception, but also are a valid tool for texture modification. This thesis demonstrates for the first time, that flavour and texture modification and subsequently the reduction of sugar, salt and (possibly also) fat can be achieved by using cross modal interactions in complex food matrices. New methods have been developed and existing methods have been combined to study aroma/taste interactions in fully controlled settings. Its multidisciplinary approach combines chemical, physical and psychological knowledge in order to discuss and explain results. It furthermore shows that combinations of different strategies are most effective in order to achieve healthier products reduced in sugar, salt and fat.  ...|$|E

Model analysis shows that consecutive backbiting/migration/βC-scission leads to a favoring of MMs with even chain lengths and a hydrogen chain end over MMs with the nonreactive chain end originating from the initial dormant polymer.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of peroxycarboxylic esters, as one subgroup of organic peroxides, {{is characterized by}} a high thermal hazard potential regarding process safety. In case of failure in the production process, e. g., if the heat of reaction cannot be removed sufficiently fast, decomposition reactions can be triggered, and as a result, remarkable amounts of heat and gas can be released and can cause a high extent of damage. Multifarious technical and organizational measures are necessary to ensure the safe industrial production of peroxides. With the introduction of microreaction technology plenty of possibilities have been opened to carry out highly exothermic reactions in smaller volumes and with more efficient heat removal.

40|$|The {{functional}} {{diversity of}} a population of sixty-five different strains of P. fragi isolated from fresh and spoiled meat was studied in order to evaluate the population heterogeneity related to meat spoilage potential. The strains were characterized for the proteolytic activity at 4 °C on beef sarcoplasmic proteins and only 9 strains {{were found to be}} proteolytic. An iron-dependent growth behaviour was shown when each strain was grown in citrate medium containing either myoglobin, haemoglobin or iron chloride as iron sources. Increase of maximum population and µmax in presence of different iron sources was registered. The release of volatile organic compounds (VOC) by each strain in beef during aerobic storage at 4 °C was evaluated by GC-MS. A considerable variability of occurrence of each molecule in the GC-MS profiles obtained by the different strains was observed ranging from 3 % to 79 % although the strains showed a high degree of similarity. In particular, <b>ethylhexanoate,</b> ethyloctanoate, ethylnonenoate, ethyldecanoate, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, 3 -octanone, 4 -methylthiophenol, 2 -pentylfurane were produced by more than 50 % of the strains. Representative strains were used to spoil meat in the same conditions used for the VOC analysis and the samples were evaluated by a sensory panel. The results of the sensory analysis indicated that the different strains could significantly affect the odour of meat and strains characterized by production of esters gave fruity odours to the spoiled meat. However, the similarity of strains based on the sensory profiles does not necessarily match the similarity shown in VOC profiles. P. fragi has {{a significant role in the}} microbial ecology of meat and the influence of meat-related sources of iron on the growth behaviour of many different strains suggests that meat can be an ecological niche for P. fragi.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to prepare high performance and fully biodegradable polymer nanocomposites. The most representative polymers classified as biodegradable are poly(!-caprolactone) (PCL) (issued from petrochemistry) and polylactide (PLA) (issued from renewable bio-resources). Biodegradable nanoparticles purposely extracted from biomass were selected, namely Cellulose NanoWhiskers (CNW) and Starch NanoCrystals (SNC). CNW are rod-like nanoparticles with 2 nanometric dimensions while SNC consists in nanosheets, thus with 1 nanometric dimension. A 3 nanometric-dimension particle often considered as “silica- type nanocage” was selected to complete this study, namely Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane (POSS). The addition of such nanoparticles was expected to enhance several properties of the filled polymer matrix, especially thermo-mechanical performances and extent of crystallinity. In this field, the quality of the nanoparticle dispersion throughout the matrix is an essential parameter to produce nanocomposite materials with largely improved properties. One of the most cited techniques to overcome nanofiller aggregation and even agglomeration relies upon the creation of strong chemical bonds between the nanoparticle and the polymer matrix, leading to the preparation of so-called nanohybrids. For that purpose, the surface of the nanoparticles was first modified by chemical grafting and polymerization reactions. The ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of e-caprolactone and L,L-lactide catalyzed by tin(II) 2 - <b>ethylhexanoate</b> (tin octoate, Sn(Oct) 2) was initiated from functional groups available on the nanoparticle surface. The grafting efficiency was demonstrated for the three investigated nanofiller/polyester systems. Different characterization techniques were approached depending on the nanofiller nature. In a second step, the so-formed nanohybrids were used as “masterbatches” and dispersed in their corresponding commercial polyester matrices, i. e. PCL and PLA, by melt-compounding using a mini-lab twin screw extruder. The nanocomposite materials were fully characterized, correlating morphological observations with thermal, mechanical and rheological properties. To highlight the beneficial effect of the surface covalent grafting, simple melt-blends, i. e. containing unmodified nanofillers and polyester matrices (PCL or PLA) were prepared. The level of property improvement was most of the time directly related to the degree of nanofiller dispersion, and proved systematically better in case of masterbatch-based materials. Keeping in mind the effect of the nanoparticle geometry, as well as its mechanical modulus, crystallinity or extent of dispersion within the polyester matrix, the rod-like 2 D-nanofiller, namely cellulose nanowhiskers extracted from ramie, appeared as the most efficient candidate for polyester reinforcement. The incorporation of PCL chains surface-grafted onto CNW contributed to substantially increasing the overall thermo- mechanical properties, most likely due to the formation of a strong physical chain network between surface- grafted chains and chains composing the matrix. Additionally, CNW-based nanohybrids revealed their potential as both nucleating sites dramatically increasing the crystallization rate of PLA matrix and compatibilizing PCL/PLA immiscible blends.
