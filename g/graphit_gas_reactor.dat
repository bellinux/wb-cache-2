40|$|The recent {{growth in}} {{interest}} for high temperature <b>gas</b> <b>reactors</b> {{has resulted in}} an increased need for materials and fuel testing {{for this type of}} reactor. The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), located at the US Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory, has long been involved in testing <b>gas</b> <b>reactor</b> fuel and materials, and has facilities and capabilities to provide the right environment for <b>gas</b> <b>reactor</b> irradiation experiments. These capabilities include both passive sealed capsule experiments, and instrumented/actively controlled experiments. The instrumented/actively controlled experiments typically contain thermocouples and control the irradiation temperature, but on-line measurements and controls for pressure and gas environment have also been performed in past irradiations. The ATR has an existing automated gas temperature control system that can maintain temperature in an irradiation experiment within very tight bounds, and has developed an on-line fission product monitoring system that is especially well suited for testing <b>gas</b> <b>reactor</b> particle fuel. The ATR’s control system, which consists primarily of vertical cylinders used to rotate neutron poisons/reflectors toward or away from the reactor core, provides a constant vertical flux profile over the duration of each operating cycle. This constant chopped cosine shaped axial flux profile, with a relatively flat peak at the vertical centre of the core, is more desirable for experiments than a constantly moving axial flux peak resulting from a control system of axially positioned control components which are vertically withdrawn from the core...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the performance and}} efficiency analysis of an integrated glycerol processing and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system. Glycerol processing {{as one of the}} renewable fuel system is employed for hydrogen production. The hydrogen produced from glycerol processing is then fed to the PEMFC system to produce the desired electricity. Here, a PEMFC power generation system composed of two subsystems: fuel reforming and fuel cell stack. A fuel reforming is regarded as a suitable process to produce hydrogen for stationary application of fuel cells because of its high hydrogen yield which subsequently is used to generate electricity through the fuel cell stack by producing a desired power outcome. The system was simulated and optimized into 3 cases. The first one involves the high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) and a glycerol reformer without water <b>gas</b> shift <b>reactor</b> whereas in the second case, a water <b>gas</b> shift <b>reactor</b> is included to improve its overall system efficiency. The third case involves low temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (LT-PEMFC) with a glycerol reformer, water <b>gas</b> shift <b>reactor</b> and preferential oxidation reactor. In this study, a direct comparison between the performance of HT-PEMFC and LT-PEMFC systems integrated with a glycerol steam reformer with and without a water <b>gas</b> shift <b>reactor</b> is shown. The target power output of both the HT-PEMFC and LT-PEMFC systems for stationary application is in the range of 1 - 8 kW, which is sufficient for small household application. Based on result, HT-PEMFC system with water <b>gas</b> shift <b>reactor</b> shows the highest composition of hydrogen that give amount of 80. 79 % which operates at 1063. 15 K and 3 atm with carbon to steam ratio of 2.

Historically, the irradiation performance of TRISO-coated <b>gas</b> <b>reactor</b> particle fuel in Germany has been superior {{to that in the}} United States. German fuel generally displayed in-pile gas release values that were three orders of magnitude lower than U. S. fuel. Thus, we have critically examined the TRISO-coated fuel fabrication processes in the U.

The postirradiation examination results are also reviewed to identify failure mechanisms that may be the cause of the poorer U. S. irradiation performance. This comparison will help determine the roles that particle fuel process/product attributes and irradiation conditions (burnup, fast neutron fluence, temperature, and degree of acceleration) have on the behavior of the fuel during irradiation and provide a more quantitative linkage between acceptable processing parameters, as-fabricated fuel properties and subsequent in-reactor performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to facilitate a better understanding of the fuel-cycle and nuclear material disposition issues associated with high-temperature <b>gas</b> <b>reactors</b> (HTGRs). This paper reviews the nuclear fuel cycles supporting early and present day <b>gas</b> <b>reactors,</b> and identifies challenges for the advanced fuel cycles and waste management systems supporting the next generation of HTGRs, including the Very High Temperature Reactor, which is under development in the Generation IV Program. The earliest gas-cooled reactors were the carbon dioxide (CO 2) -cooled reactors. Historical experience is available from over 1, 000 reactor-years of operation from 52 electricity-generating, CO 2 -cooled reactor plants that were placed in operation worldwide. Following the CO 2 reactor development, seven HTGR plants were built and operated. The HTGR came about from the combination of helium coolant and graphite moderator. Helium was used instead of air or CO 2 as the coolant. The helium gas has a significant technical base due to the experience gained in the United States from the 40 -MWe Peach Bottom and 330 -MWe Fort St. Vrain reactors designed by General Atomics. Germany also built and operated the 15 -MWe Arbeitsgemeinschaft Versuchsreaktor (AVR) and the 300 -MWe Thorium High-Temperature Reactor (THTR) power plants. The AVR, THTR, Peach Bottom and Fort St. Vrain all used fuel containing thorium in various forms (i. e., carbides, oxides, thorium particles) and mixtures with highly enriched uranium. The operational experience gained from these early <b>gas</b> <b>reactors</b> can be applied to the next generation of nuclear power systems. HTGR systems are being developed in South Africa, China, Japan, the United States, and Russia. Elements of the HTGR system evaluated included fuel demands on uranium ore mining and milling, conversion, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication; fuel management in-core; spent fuel characteristics affecting fuel recycling and refabrication, fuel handling, interim storage, packaging, transportation, waste forms, waste treatment, decontamination and decommissioning issues; and low-level waste (LLW) and high-level waste (HLW) disposal...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a study on}} a fusion reactor core is {{presented}} in heavy ion inertial fusion (HIF), including the heavy ion beam (HIB) transport in a fusion reactor, a HIB interaction with a background <b>gas,</b> <b>reactor</b> cavity <b>gas</b> dynamics, the <b>reactor</b> <b>gas</b> backflow to the beam lines, and a HIB fusion reactor design. The HIB has remarkable preferable features to release the fusion energy in inertial fusion: in particle accelerators HIBs are generated with a high driver efficiency of ~ 30 - 40 %, and the HIB ions deposit their energy inside of materials. Therefore, a requirement for the fusion target energy gain is relatively low, that would be ~ 50 to operate a HIF fusion reactor with a standard energy output of 1 GW of electricity. In a fusion reactor the HIB charge neutralization is needed for a ballistic HIB transport. Multiple mechanical shutters would be installed at each HIB port at the reactor wall to stop the blast waves and the chamber gas backflow, so that the accelerator final elements would be protected from the <b>reactor</b> <b>gas</b> contaminant.
