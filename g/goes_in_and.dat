There, Glenn begins to pray for the {{well-being}} of his fellow survivors, while T-Dog receives medical treatment for blood poisoning. Meanwhile Carl <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of consciousness, and briefly recalls his encounter with the deer before going into a seizure. A distraught Lori opines to Rick about ending Carl's suffering, but Rick insists on keeping him alive.|$|E

If you came in {{as a free agent}} and were just a gunner on the punt team or the third safety, you were doing something the team needed to win...It was his way of emphasizing that no one is irreplaceable. You have to coach everybody the same way. If Joe Greene goes out, Steve Furness <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> we're not going to change anything. Chuck never panicked when someone got hurt or held out. We can still function. That made a big impression on me.|$|E

500|$|This {{passage is}} {{explained}} in the Byzantine writer John Tzetzes' scholia as a reference to Troilus seeking to avoid the unwanted sexual advances of Achilles by taking refuge in his father Apollo's temple. When he refuses to come out, Achilles <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> kills him on the altar. Lycophron's scholiast also says that Apollo started to plan Achilles' death after the murder. This begins {{to build up the}} elements of the version of Troilus' story given above: he is young, much loved and beautiful; he has divine ancestry, is beheaded by his rejected Greek lover and, we know from Homer, {{had something to do with}} horses. The reference to Troilus as a [...] "lion whelp" [...] hints at his having the potential to be a great hero, but there is no explicit reference to a prophecy linking the possibility of Troilus reaching adulthood and Troy then surviving.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote, [...] "It's got some {{effective}} moments and aspects, {{but the film}} <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of plausibility, and its elements never manage to unify into a coherent whole". Claudia Puig, in her review for USA Today, wrote, [...] "The dialogue by screenwriter Eric Warren Singer is spotty. There are some great, pithy lines and others whose attempt at profundity ring false". Roger Ebert gave the film {{three out of four}} stars and wrote, [...] "Clive Owen makes a semi-believable hero, not performing too many feats that are physically unlikely. He's handsome and has the obligatory macho stubble, but he has a quality that makes you worry a little about him". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B–" [...] rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "the star of the pic may well be NYC's Guggenheim Museum and Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, both of which figure in cool action chase sequences that pay handsome dividends".|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve a}} tone and quality {{that was true}} to the story as well as {{reflected}} {{the period in which}} it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, saying, [...] "Early on, we both knew that we did not want this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." [...] Kamiński had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the protective coating, the light <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "When I {{finished}} {{that album}} I {{never wanted to}} speak to him again," [...] Kooper said. [...] "I was cheesed off at how difficult whole thing was...He just changed his mind every three seconds so I just ended up doing the work of three albums...We'd get a side order <b>and</b> we'd <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> master it and he'd say, 'No, no, no. I want to do this.' And then, 'No, let's <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> cut this.'... There was another version of 'Went to See the Gypsy' that was really good... It was the first time I <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> had an arrangement idea for it and I said, 'Let me <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> cut this track and then you can sing over it.' So I cut this track and it was really good... <b>and</b> he came <b>in</b> <b>and</b> pretended like he didn't understand where to sing on it." ...|$|R

500|$|Many of the 82 Fredman's Epistles remain {{popular in}} Sweden. Their diverse styles and themes may be {{illustrated}} {{with examples of}} some of the best-known songs. To begin with No. 23, Ach du min Moder! (Alas, thou my mother), which has been described as [...] "the to-be-or-not-to-be of Swedish literature", tells, in realist style, the story of a drunk who wakes in a Stockholm gutter outside the Crawl-In Tavern. He curses his parents for conceiving him [...] "perhaps upon a table" [...] as he looks at his torn clothes. Then the tavern door opens, and he <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> has his first drink. The song ends with loud thanks to the drunk's mother and father. In contrast, the Rococo No. 28, I går såg jag ditt barn, min Fröja (Yesterday I saw thy child, my Freya), tells the tale of an attempt to arrest the [...] "nymph" [...] Ulla Winblad, based on a real event. Bellman here combines realism – Ulla wearing a black embroidered bodice, and losing her watch in a named street (Yxsmedsgränd) in Stockholm's Gamla stan – with images from classical mythology, such as a myrtle crown and an allusion to the goddess Aphrodite.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{released}} {{more than}} eight remixes of the song in different formats. At the time, [...] "Secret" [...] was experiencing success on the US record charts, to keep the song current in dance clubs, Madonna requested remixes of the song from Junior Vasquez, who was a DJ at the Sound Factory nightclub in New York. According to him Madonna's representatives [...] "sent me a cassette of the song, just {{to get an idea}} what the song was... nd when it was 100 beats per minute I said, 'Oh god, what am I gonna do with this?'" [...] Vasquez and his team of engineers first experimented with the track by making remixes closer to the original version. Then he used only Madonna's vocals for the mixed versions, and re-wrote and composed the music as brand new. He was sure of doing house mixes of the track but had to [...] "speed-up" [...] Madonna's vocals. Recording engineer Dennis Mitchell explained, [...] "To do that we have to digitally manipulate her vocals, which is time compression... It just digitally <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> snipes out tiny little digital slices of the actual sound and squeezes it together so that her tempo is a new tempo but her pitch stays the same." [...] According to Vasquez, Madonna was [...] "on top of everything" [...] including the house mixes {{as well as the other}} mixes created.|$|E
2500|$|Among Goody's remarks were, [...] "I've {{seen how}} she <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of people's arseholes" [...] and Shetty [...] "makes [...] skin crawl". She also called Shetty [...] "Shilpa Fuckawalla" [...] and [...] "Shilpa Poppadom". Other, unbroadcast {{incidents}} of racism were later alleged, including a late-night limerick game between O'Meara, Lloyd, Goody and Tweed {{in which the}} word [...] "Paki" [...] was implied but not said. Goody allegedly wondered aloud if Lloyd used [...] "the P-word", and referred to Shetty as [...] "Shilpa Pashwa whoever you fucking are".|$|E

[...] He hesitates over various means of death, poison, a noose, etc. [...] He stabs himself with a saber; the blade <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out his sleeve. [...] Then he gets a gun, unhooks the mirror from the wall, sets it against the carafe, stands in a good {{position}} to see himself, his image appearing in the mirror. [...] The shot rings out and Pierrot falls, thinking himself dead. [...] When he comes to, he flees the theater of his crime, boards a boat, is taken with seasickness, shipwrecks {{in the middle of the}} most terrifying storm, swims to safety and collapses, exhausted, on a desert island.|$|E
2500|$|According to Walter Gratzer, {{the study}} of {{nutrition}} probably began during the 6th century BC. In China, the concept of qi developed, a spirit or [...] "wind" [...] similar to what Western Europeans later called pneuma. Food was classified into [...] "hot" [...] (for example, meats, blood, ginger, and hot spices) and [...] "cold" [...] (green vegetables) in China, India, Malaya, and Persia. Humours developed perhaps first in China alongside qi. Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements (Wu Xing: fire, water, earth, wood, and metal), and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets. About {{the same time in}} Italy, Alcmaeon of Croton (a Greek) wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> what goes out, and warned that imbalance would result in disease marked by obesity or emaciation.|$|E
2500|$|It was in Boston that Mike became [...] "King" [...] Kelly, {{although}} he was still overwhelmingly referred to as [...] "Mike" [...] or [...] "The Only" [...] in contemporaneous reporting. As {{a member of the}} Beaneaters, he continued to be a key run-producer, scoring 120 runs in 1887 and 1889. He continued to play well and was a great box office draw, but Boston didn't win any pennants. Freed from the watchful eye of Spalding and Anson, Kelly became less self-disciplined. [...] One day in 1888, Boston player-manager John Morrill fined him $100 for not reporting to the grounds one day. After dinner the night before, Kelly had told Morrill he was ill, and Morrill said he should still report. The Boston Herald said, [...] "Every man on the team thinks [...] was deserved." [...] The Herald also said of Kelly, [...] "At times he <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> plays with his whole spirit, and he puts life into the team. [...] A sample of that was seen in yesterday's game, a game that he won for the Bostons. At other times he plays carelessly and indifferently, puts on a spirit of independence, disobeys Morrill on instructions at will, and does as he pleases." ...|$|E

2500|$|During [...] "After Hours", Jim enlists Dwight into {{trying to}} get Kathy, an {{unwanted}} female suitor, {{out of his room}} by tricking Dwight into thinking that he has bedbugs. This prompts Dwight to overreact, first by stripping down to ward off bugs and then spraying Jim's bed with cleaning chemicals. However, the ploy works when Kathy exits the room. Jim and Dwight are then shown sharing ice cream and a friendly smile in Dwight's room, while watching TV on his bed, where it is implied Jim will have to stay the night due to the chemicals in his own room, as earlier Dwight suggested Jim stay with Kathy. In [...] "Last Day in Florida", Robert California confides to Jim that he's going to terminate Dwight's plans to launch the Sabre store, effectively terminating Dwight's job altogether. Jim tries to let Dwight know, who dismisses his warnings as nothing more than just another prank and insults Jim throughout the day, including {{in front of the other}} Sabre staff. At Pam's insistence, Jim tries to tell Dwight one more time before he's dismissed, just as Dwight is about to accept what he thinks is his promotion in the board room. However, Jim physically attacks Dwight just before he <b>goes</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> the two had a wrestling match to which Jim finally concedes. When Dwight steps in, he sees that Packer, who has stolen Dwight's promotion in the meantime, takes the fall and is promptly fired by Robert in the meeting. Defeated, Dwight walks out of the boardroom and lends Jim a hand up and returns to Scranton. When Kelly sees Dwight, she mentions that she thought Dwight was staying in Florida, prompting Jim to distract her with a compliment.|$|E
2500|$|Will Hodgkinson from The Times {{reviewed}} the shows at London's The O2, {{and gave it}} a 5 on 5 star rating. He commented that [...] "Madonna <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of fashion but one constant remains: her tenacity... returned to the O2 for a concert that proved that there's nothing like a near-death experience to reinvigorate the Queen of Pop." [...] Another 5 star rating came from Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph who noticed that the loudest cheer for the concert came when Madonna successfully unraveled herself of her cape during [...] "Living for Love", referring to her falling down at the Brit Awards earlier the year. McCormick described the concert as [...] "a dazzling hi-tech, multimedia melange of light and sound, with eye and mind boggling set pieces featuring fantasy medieval executioners, martial art fighting geishas, pole dancing nuns, simulated sex shows." [...] Peter Robinson from The Guardian rated it 4 on 5 stars complimenting [...] "Iconic" [...] as the [...] "perfect opening number". He observed that most [...] "signature hits appear in an updated style... but when Madonna delivers a refreshingly faithful version of 'Deeper and Deeper', it's the night's highlight." [...] Kitty Empire from the same newspaper also rated it 5 on 5 stars, commending the performances during [...] "Illuminati", [...] "True Blue" [...] and the impromptu performance of [...] "Like a Prayer", calling it [...] "the most charismatic song of the night". Nick Levine from NME believed that [...] "too much" [...] of singing the songs from Rebel Heart [...] "could have felt try-hard from [...] ", but [...] "on stage she still works harder and delivers more thrills than her younger rivals. Nobody fucks with the queen? It's hard to disagree". Reviewing the show for BBC, Mark Savage commented that Madonna was [...] "charismatic enough to command the entire arena on her own and the show's strongest moments come when she's solo on stage".|$|E
