5000|$|June 2016, Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has {{released}} a report discussing the Israel’s repetitive destruction of <b>EU-funded</b> <b>projects</b> in Palestine. The report [...] "squandered aid" [...] claimed that, since 2001, Israeli authorities have destroyed around 150 development projects, which incurs the EU a financial loss of approximately €58. The report estimated {{the total value of}} EU squandered aid money, including development and humanitarian projects, amounts to €65million—of which at least €23million were lost during the 2014 assault alone. The Monitor called for investigation on all destruction structures built with funding from the UN, EU or member states on Palestinian land. In addition, the monitor recommended to continue investing in Palestinian development, but substantively penalize the Israeli government when UN- or European-funded projects are targeted.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{interactive}} environments. One is to re-create 3D space with visual representations of the museum by a 3D architectural metaphor, which provides {{a sense of place}} using various spatial references. They usually use 3D modelling, VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling Language) and now X3D(successor to VRML) for viewing. There have been introduced various kinds of imaging techniques for building virtual museums, such as infrared reflectography, X-ray imaging, 3D laser scanning, IBMR (Image Based Rendering and Modeling) techniques. In the case of <b>EU-funded</b> <b>projects,</b> the ViHAP3D, a new virtual reality system for scanning museum artifacts, has been developed by EU researchers. Another interactive three-dimensional spatial environment is QTVR. Being a pre-rendered, fixed environment it is more restricted in regards to moving freely around in 3D space but the image quality can be superior to that of real-time rendered environments. This was especially the case in the mid-1990s when computing power and online speeds were limited.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this Round Table, the invited {{participants}} {{and the audience}} discussed and commented about what can be learnt from the experiences of CALL <b>EU-funded</b> <b>projects</b> and how projections towards the future can be made. Under the main topic, the issues proposed for discussion were: 1) {{the consequences of the}} rapid pace in technological changes; 2) the transferability of the achievements, products, or research of CALL projects; 3) the contribution of innovative uses of established or leading-edge technologies to the development of real-life language skills; and 4) the impact of EU-funded CALL projects on European multilingualism. The questions of the choice of technologies and of the sustainability of projects were among the main concerns during this discussion, and whereas a number of problems were raised, solutions were also explored to make the experience of project coordinators and partners an asset for the future. The end users of the products developed in CALL <b>EU-funded</b> <b>projects</b> were also very much at the centre of the discussions...|$|E
