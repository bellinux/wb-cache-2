40|$|The Space Transportation System (STS) fleet {{has flown}} nearly 40 {{missions}} (as of November 1990) over the nearly ten years since its first flight. As {{a result of}} encounters with on-orbit particulates (space debris and micrometeoroids), atmospheric debris (ice, insulation) or ground damage 37 impact features (chips) have been found on the STS outer windows. Nearly half of the chips were large enough to warrant replacement of the window. The frequency and magnitude of these impact features are correlated against window location, mission duration and altitude, and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight.</b> Interpretation of the results into number and size flux rates requires an understanding of STS operations. The data from the weeks of on-orbit exposure provide a small glimpse as to the effects that space debris and micrometeoroid impacts will have on fused silica components of systems that will remain in altitudes between 300 - 500 km {{for long periods of}} time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background During {{the initial}} {{containment}} phase of influenza A/H 1 N 1 2009, close contacts of cases were traced to provide antiviral prophylaxis within 48 h after exposure and to alert them on signs of disease for early diagnosis and treatment. Passengers {{seated on the}} same row, two rows in front or behind a patient infectious for influenza, during a flight of ≥ 4 h were considered close contacts. This study evaluates the timeliness of flight-contact tracing (CT) as performed following national and international CT requests addressed to the Center of Infectious Disease Control (CIb/RIVM), and implemented by the Municipal Health Services of Schiphol Airport. Methods Elapsed days between <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> arrival and the date passenger lists became available (contact details identified - CI) was used as proxy for timeliness of CT. In a retrospective study, dates of flight arrival, onset of illness, laboratory diagnosis, CT request and identification of contacts details through passenger lists, following CT requests to the RIVM for flights landed at Schiphol Airport were collected and analyzed. Results 24 requests for CT were identified. Three of these were declined as over 4 days had elapsed since flight arrival. In 17 out of 21 requests, contact details were obtained within 7 days after arrival (81 %). The average delay between arrival and CI was 3, 9 days (range 2 - 7), mainly caused by delay in diagnosis of the index patient after arrival (2, 6 days). In four flights (19 %), contacts were not identified or only after > 7 days. CI involving Dutch airlines was faster than non-Dutch airlines (P Conclusion CT for influenza A/H 1 N 1 2009 among flight passengers was not successful for timely provision of prophylaxis. CT had little additional value for alerting passengers for disease symptoms, as this information already was provided {{during and after the}} flight. Public health authorities should take into account patient delays in seeking medical advise and laboratory confirmation in relation to maximum time to provide postexposure prophylaxis when deciding to install contact tracing measures. International standardization of CT guidelines is recommended. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a forecasting system for predicting {{the number of}} boarding passengers {{on each of the}} next N departure <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> a particular <b>flight</b> leg using as input the booking levels made for the next N departure <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> that <b>flight</b> leg. A forecasting system that gives good estimates of future boardings <b>of</b> a particular <b>flight</b> leg is an important and essential tool for route management in the airline industry. The proposed forecasting system consists of a Kalman filter, which optimally integrates a large class of reservation measurements {{from a variety of sources}} and at arbitrary times, which is the case of the data, considered here. The accuracy of the predictions for a case study proved to be promising. PublishedN/...|$|R
