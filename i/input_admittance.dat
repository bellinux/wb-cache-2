40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the stability {{issue of the}} meshed DC distributed power systems (DPS) with constant power loads (CPLs) and proposes a stability enhancement method based on virtual harmonic resistance. In previous researches, the network dynamics of the meshed DC DPS are often ignored, which affects the derivation of the equivalent system impendence. In addition, few of them have considered the meshed DC DPS including multiple sources with voltage-controlled converters and CPLs. To tackle the aforementioned challenge, this paper mainly makes the following efforts. The component connection method (CCM) is employed and expanded to derive the stability criterion of the meshed DC DPS with CPLs. This stability criterion can be simplified to relate only with the network node admittance matrix, the output impendences of the sources, and the <b>input</b> <b>admittances</b> of the CPLs. A virtual harmonic resistance through the second-order generalized integrator (SOGI) is added in the source with the voltage-controlled converter to lower {{the peak of the}} source output impendence, which can enhance the stability of the meshed DC DPS.

40|$|Abstract — Many surface {{acoustic}} wave (SAW) devices consist of quasiperiodic structures which are designed by successive repetition of a base cell. The precise numerical simulation of such devices including all physical effects is currently beyond the capacity of high end computation. Therewith, we have to restrict the numerical analysis to the periodic substructure. By using the finite element method (FEM), {{this can be done}} by introducing special boundaries, so called periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). To be able to describe the complete dispersion behavior of waves including damping effects, the PBC {{has to be able to}} model each mode which can be excited within the periodic structure. Therefore, the condition used for the PBCs must hold for each phase and amplitude difference existing at periodic boundaries. Based on the Floquet theorem, this criteria is fulfilled by our two newly developed PBC algorithms. In the first part of this paper we describe the basic theory of the PBCs. Based on the FEM, we develop two different methods which allow the calculation of phase and attenuation constants of waves propagating on periodic structures. Further on, we show how to compute the charge distribution of periodic SAW structures with the aid of the new PBCs. In the second part, we compare the measured and simulated dispersion behavior of waves propagating on periodic SAW structures on two different piezoelectric substrates. Finally, we compare measured and simulated <b>input</b> <b>admittances</b> of structures similar to SAW resonators. I...|$|R

Meanwhile, with the improvement of device fabrication and material growth techniques, the resonator can be made with very small size, especially thin film bulk {{acoustic wave}} resonators (FBARs) based on ZnO and AlN have been attracted much interest for sensor application due to their high sensitivity induced by high resonance frequency. In this thesis, research focus is on the modeling and experimental study of bulk acoustic wave resonator sensor. Quartz thickness shear mode (TSM) resonator is adopted to characterize the viscoelastic properties of polymer nanocomposite thin films deposited on the resonators surface. The <b>input</b> electric <b>admittance</b> of multilayer loaded TSM acoustic wave resonator is firstly derived using transfer matrix method by taking into account the acoustic wave impedance of the polymeric layer. Nanocomposite thin films of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in copolymers of polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) are deposited on TSM resonators through spin-on coating processing. The electric impedance spectra of the unloaded and loaded acoustic wave resonators are measured experimentally, and a data fitting approach is applied to extract the properties of the polymer nanocomposites films. It has been found that the thickness of the polymer layer plays a very important role in the extraction of the viscoelastic properties of the films through data fitting, and the reinforcement of the elastic shear modulus of polymer nanocomposite films is not significant. Quartz TSM resonator is also investigated for in-situ and real time detection of liquid flow rate. A 5 MHz TSM quartz resonator is edge-bonded to the sensor mounting port of a special flow chamber with one side exposed to the flowing liquid and other side exposed to air. The fundamental, 3 rd, 5 th, 7 th, and 9 th resonant frequency shift due to flow pressure is found to be around 920 (Hz), 3572 (Hz), 5947 (Hz), 8228 (Hz) and 10300 (Hz) for flow rate variation from 0 to 3000 ml/min, which has a corresponding Reynolds number change from 0 to 822. Both theoretical and experimental investigation shows the resonant frequency shifts of different modes are quadratic with flow rate. The results indicate that quartz TSM resonators can be used for flow sensors with characteristics of simplicity, fast response, and good repeatability.

40|$|A {{telemanipulation}} system lets a {{human operator}} manipulate an environment on distance, using a master and a slave device, which are {{connected by a}} bilateral controller that controls the master and the slave device and provides the communication between these devices. The master device is manipulated by the operator and these actions are transferred to the slave device, using the bilateral controller. The interaction forces between the slave device and the remote environment are fed back to the operator, which provides awareness and allows a task to be executed efficiently and safely. Currently, one {{of the limitations of}} telemanipulation systems is that interaction forces are typically indirectly transferred to the human operator. Firstly, a commonly used concept to determine the feedback forces, is by coupling the master and slave position, using a proportional controller. Secondly, feedback forces are generally applied on the master device, which then transfers these forces to the operator through its end effector. Because of the dynamics of the master device, these forces are distorted as they are transferred to the operator. This reduction in force feedback quality decreases awareness of the operator and thereby likely reduces his or her task performance. To minimize the distortion of the feedback forces by the dynamics of the master device, often a parallel manipulator is used as master device. Compared to a serial manipulator, a parallel manipulator has the advantage that the moving masses are small, because the actuators are positioned at the base. However, the difficulty of parallel manipulators is the kinematic and dynamic modeling of the device, which is much more complex than the modeling of serial manipulators. The goal of this research is to improve force feedback quality. This is achieved through the design of a local admittance controller for a parallel master device, which will cancel out the dynamics of the parallel master device and allows them to be replaced by desired dynamics (desired mass, damping and stiffness). Using this approach, the feedback quality will not only be of higher quality, but will also enable a more complete and intuitive method to design the force feedback. However, generally an admittance controller requires the external force applied by the operator as input. Force sensors are expensive and fragile. As a more cost-effective solution, in this thesis the external force will be obtained by force estimation using a model based observer. The model based observer only requires the position measurements, and control wrench (combination of force and torque) at the end effector, as <b>input.</b> The <b>admittance</b> controller for the parallel master device, without the use of a force sensor, is configured by combining insights from different fields of robot analysis and control. The control algorithm will be build up by a computed torque controller, the desired dynamics to shape desired acceleration, an observer, an observer based force estimator and methods to derive a kinematic and a dynamic model of a parallel manipulator. The control method is tested on a three degrees of freedom planar parallel device: the Munin. The tests show that the algorithm is able to replace the dynamics of the master device with desired dynamics, such that the device admits a certain motion, with respect to the desired dynamics and the external force applied by the human operator. The limits of the range of desired stiffness, damping and mass, that can be projected on the manipulator’s end effector by the control algorithm, are explored. This range is large enough to conclude that the algorithm is suitable to be used on parallel master devices, to project desired dynamics on the end effector of the device, without the use of a force sensor. The control algorithm is designed to control the master device of a telemanipulation system. This enables a intuitive configuration of force feedback. The desired dynamics can be shaped, which can be beneficial to advanced control concepts, such as haptic shared feedback and model mediated control, on top of the feedback directly available form the measurements at the slave device. Furthermore, the control algorithm could also be beneficial for the safe operation for all kinds of devices that cooperate with a human, because of the force estimation, instead of force measurement on one point of the device, will react to all forces applied anywhere on the device.

The <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> measurements also show evidence of excitation of an additional wave mode and excess loss due to the finger resistance. The results of these simulations and measurements will be useful in the design of surface acoustic wave gas sensors...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of <b>input</b> <b>admittance,</b> {{over the}} {{frequency}} range 300 Mcs/s. to 900 Mcs/s., {{were made on}} four different types of triodes represented by the HY 75, 826, 388, 957. A coaxial resonant line {{was used as the}} measuring device. It was found that the cold tube <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> increases rapidly with increasing frequency over the normally used range, passing through alternant poles and zeros. This indicates that another usefull range of tube operation may be obtained at frequencies higher than the first series resonant frequency. Also the inductive input susceptance observed in that range may be found usefull. An indication of transit time effects was also obtained though it would appear that in most high frequency triodes the top frequency limit is mainly determined by the cold tube circuit effects...|$|E
