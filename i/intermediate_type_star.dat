40|$|We {{present an}} {{implementation}} of stellar evolution and chemical feedback for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. We consider the timed release of individual elements by both massive (Type II supernovae and stellar winds) and <b>intermediate</b> mass <b>stars</b> (<b>Type</b> Ia supernovae and asymptotic giant branch stars). We illustrate {{the results of}} our method using a suite of cosmological simulations that include new prescriptions for radiative cooling, star formation, and galactic winds. Radiative cooling is implemented element-by-element, in the presence of an ionizing radiation background, and we track all 11 elements that contribute significantly to the radiative cooling. While all simulations presented here use a single set of physical parameters, we take specific care to investigate the robustness of the predictions of chemodynamical simulations with respect to the ingredients, the methods, and the numerical convergence. A comparison of nucleosynthetic yields taken from the literature indicates that relative abundance ratios may only be reliable at the factor of two level, even for a fixed initial mass function. Abundances relative to iron are even more uncertain because the rate of supernovae Ia is not well known...|$|R
40|$|Context. Understanding {{the origin}} of the instabilities of LBVs is {{important}} for shedding light on the late evolutionary stages of massive stars and on the chemical evolution of galaxies. Aims. To investigate the physical nature of variable stars in the upper H - R diagram, we performed a spectrophotometric study of the Romano's star GR 290 and the Hubble- Sandage variables A, B, and C in the close galaxy M 33. Methods. New spectroscopic and photometric data were employed in conjunction with already published data of these stars in order to derive spectral types, energy distribution and bolometric luminosities. Results. The yellow hypergiant Var A is still at minimum, with a similar to G-type spectrum and strong H alpha emission (W-eq similar or equal to - 35 angstrom). Var B is in a low luminosity hot state (V = 17. 5, B - V = - 0. 15) with very strong Ha emission (W-eq = - 310 angstrom). Its absolute bolometric luminosity is 0. 6 x 10 (6) L-circle dot. Var C, at V = 16. 4, is fainter than in the mid 1980 s, but its spectrum shows the typical features of LBVs at maximum, a spectrum that is very rich in Fe II emission lines. Its L-bol is about 0. 7 x 10 (6) L-circle dot. The Romano's star GR 290 has a rich hot emission-line spectrum and is very bright with L-bol = 3 x 10 (6) L-circle dot. During 2004 the star brightened by similar to half magnitude in each of the BVR filters. Conclusions. Our observations confirm that Var A probably is an <b>intermediate</b> <b>type</b> hypergiant <b>star</b> surrounded by an expanding envelope with a collisionally excited hydrogen emission, largely obscured by dusty disk and nebula. In recent years, Var B has undergone a blueward transition in the H - R diagram, probably at constant bolometric luminosity, while Var C is in a post- maximum phase with an eta Car-type spectrum. GR 290 is notable for its spectrum and luminosity, and it is likely to develop ample spectral variations in the near future, similar to those observed in AG Car...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Cholangiolocellular {{carcinoma}} (CLC) is {{an extremely}} rare malignant liver tumor. It is thought to originate from the ductules and/or canals of Hering, where hepatic stem cells (HpSC) are located, but there are few reports on cancer stem cell markers in CLC. Thus, we evaluated the significance of cancer stem cell markers, including CD 133, CD 44, and EpCAM, in CLC. Methods The subjects {{of this study were}} three patients with CLC and one patient with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>type</b> of combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma (CHC). The cancer cell markers, CK 7, CK 19, and EMA, were evalu-ated immunohistochemically.

On the other hand, in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>type</b> of CHC, only CD 44 was positive, whereas CD 133 and EpCAM were negative.

40|$|In this work, we {{select the}} high {{signal-to-noise}} ratio spectra of stars from the LAMOST data andmap theirMK classes to the spectral features. The equivalentwidths of the prominent spectral lines, playing the similar {{role as the}} multi-color photometry, form a clean stellar locus well ordered by MK classes. The advantage of the stellar locus in line indices is that it gives a natural and continuous classification of stars consistent with either the broadly used MK classes or the stellar astrophysical parameters. We also employ a SVM-based classification algorithm to assignMK classes to the LAMOST stellar spectra. We find that the completenesses of the classification are up to 90 % for A and G <b>type</b> <b>stars,</b> while it is down to about 50 % for OB and K <b>type</b> <b>stars.</b> About 40 % of the OB and K <b>type</b> <b>stars</b> are mis-classified as A and G <b>type</b> <b>stars,</b> respectively. This is likely owe to the difference of the spectral features between the late B type and early A <b>type</b> <b>stars</b> or between the late G and early K <b>type</b> <b>stars</b> are very weak. The relative poor performance of the automatic MK classification with SVM suggests that the directly use of the line indices to classify stars is likely a more preferable choice.

40|$|The {{chickpea}} (Cicer arietinum L.) core collection {{consists of}} 1956 accessions, of which 1465 are desi, 433 kabuli, and 58 <b>intermediate</b> <b>types.</b> This core collection was evaluated for 7 morphological descriptors and 15 agronomic characteristics to estimate phenotypic diversity. All {{the three groups}} differed significantly for flower colour, plant colour, dots on seed testa, seed testa texture, plant width, days to maturity, pods per plant, 100 -seed weight and plot yield. The kabuli and <b>intermediate</b> <b>types</b> {{were not significantly different}} for growth habit and seed colour, they differed, however, significantly from desi types for both traits. Desi, kabuli, and <b>intermediate</b> <b>types</b> were significantly different for plant width, days to maturity, pods per plant, 100 -seed weight, and plot yield. Kabuli plants have broad plant width, matured late, have lowest average number of pods, highest 100 -seed weight, and lowest plot yield. There were significant phenotypic correlations among the various characteristics. Two of these, between days to 50 % flowering and flowering duration and between pod number and plant yield, explained 50 % variation in the other trait in all three groups. Principal component analysis showed that days to 50 % flowering, plant width, apical secondary branches, tertiary branches, dots on seed testa, 100 -seed weight, flowering duration, basal secondary branches, seed colour, and seed testa texture were important traits in explaining multivariate polymorphism. Growth habit and basal primary branches did not significantly account for variation in the first five principal components of desi, kabuli, and <b>intermediate</b> <b>types</b> {{as well as for the}} entire core collection, indicating their low importance as chickpea descriptors. The average phenotypic diversity index was highest in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>types</b> (0. 2653) and lowest in the kabuli types (0. 1490).

40|$|According {{to their}} feeding habits, {{ruminants}} {{can be classified}} as grazers, concentrate selectors and those of <b>intermediate</b> <b>type.</b> The different feeding types are reflected in distinct anatomical properties of the forestomachs. The present {{study was designed to}} investigate whether the intrinsic innervation patterns of the rumen (the main part of the forestomach) differ between <b>intermediate</b> <b>types</b> and grazers. Myenteric plexus preparations from the rumen of goats (<b>intermediate</b> <b>type),</b> fallow deer (<b>intermediate</b> <b>type),</b> cattle (grazer) and sheep (grazer) were analysed by immunohistochemical detection of the following antigens: Hu-protein (HuC/D), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), substance P (SP), calbindin (CALB) and somatostatin (SOM). Myenteric ganglia of cattle contained 73 ± 6 neurons per ganglion, whereas the ganglia of sheep were significantly smaller (45 ± 18 neurons per ganglion). The ganglion density of the myenteric plexus was highest in fallow deer (15 ± 3 ganglia per cm 2) and lowest in cattle (6 ± 1 ganglia per cm 2). All myenteric neurons were either ChAT or NOS positive. The proportion of NOS-positive neurons was significantly lower in sheep (29. 5 ± 8. 2 % of all neurons) than in goats (44. 2 ± 9. 8 %). In all species, additional analysis of the different neuropeptides revealed the following subpopulations in descending order of percentile appearance: ChAT/SP > NOS/VIP/NPY > ChAT/– > NOS/NPY. Expression of CALB was detected in a minority of the ChAT-positive neurons in all species. Somatostatin immunoreactive somata were found only in preparations obtained from fallow deer and sheep. These data suggest that the rumen of grazers is under stronger cholinergic control than the rumen of species belonging to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>type,</b> although most subpopulations of neurons are present in all species. However, whether the strong mixing patterns of low quality roughage during digestion are enabled by the prominent excitatory input of the rumen of grazers requires elucidation in further studies...|$|R

The most degenerate cultures did not produce solvents and gave rise to large diffuse colonies that did not contain spores. These diffuse colonies did not produce outgrowths. <b>Intermediate</b> colony <b>types</b> were also observed. These could be derived from liquid cultures that were relatively poor solvent producers or from the outgrowths of colonies of efficient solvent-producing strains.

Models of terrestrial planet formation indicate that rocky planets are likely to achieve their final masses at around 10 - 30 Myr, and thus this cluster is at an interesting epoch for planet formation. We find 21 B-F 5 <b>type</b> <b>stars</b> and 14 F 6 -K 9 <b>type</b> <b>stars</b> which have 24 um excess emission, and thus determine that > 30 % of B-F 5 <b>type</b> <b>stars</b> and > 23 % of F 6 -K 9 <b>type</b> <b>stars</b> in this cluster have 24 um excess emission.
