5|$|In {{the years}} since Jock Stein's death, some, {{including}} Alex Ferguson, {{have said that they}} noticed changes in him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> prior to the game against Wales. The night before, Stein had invited Ferguson and Andy Roxburgh to his hotel room, where he reminisced with them about his time in football, something that he rarely if ever did; he also persuaded his family not to make the trip to Cardiff to watch the game. Further, Ferguson noted that, during the half-time interval, Stein did not dominate the dressing room in the way he normally did, while Gordon Strachan found it difficult to understand precisely what Stein was saying during his team-talk. However, Strachan came to accept that the final decision Stein made, to replace him with Davie Cooper, was the correct one given Cooper's subsequent impact on the game.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> {{before the}} riots, several violent and racist {{disturbances}} occurred in Oldham, which {{are attributed to}} provoking the riots.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> {{following}} the disaster, police fed false stories {{to the press}} suggesting that hooliganism and drinking by Liverpool supporters were {{the root causes of}} the disaster. Blaming of Liverpool fans persisted even after the Taylor Report of 1990, which found that the main cause of the disaster was a failure of control by South Yorkshire Police (SYP). Following the Taylor report, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ruled there was no evidence to justify prosecution of individuals or institutions. The disaster also led to a number of safety improvements in the largest English football grounds, notably the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> that followed, {{relatives}} {{and friends of the}} victims took the bodies for private burial and collected the abandoned belongings from the Greathead. The sea search for the Darlwyne wreck continued through the autumn and winter and into 1967, led by HMS Iveston. This navy minesweeper, equipped with the latest sonar equipment, carried out exhaustive searches in the area around Dodman Point, thought to be the vessel's most likely resting place. Although more than 600 dives were carried out, no sign of Darlwyne was discovered. In December 1966 the navy storeship HMS Maxim investigated the seabed around Looe, after reports that a trawler had lost its nets after they caught on an unidentified object.|$|E
25|$|Between 1972 and 1991, 29 {{volcanic}} eruptions were recorded, mostly on Java. The two most violent {{volcanic eruptions}} {{in modern times}} occurred in Indonesia; in 1815 Mount Tambora in Sumbawa erupted killing 92,000 people. Tambora produced the largest eruption known on the planet during the past 10,000 years. Also the eruption created an umbrella of volcanic ash which spread and blanketed Southeast Asia, plunging it into darkness for a week, and made a whole world without a summer in 1815. The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa {{was one of the}} deadliest and most destructive volcanic events in recorded history. Nearly 40,000 deaths are attributed to the eruption itself and the tsunamis it created. Significant additional effects were also felt around the world <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> after the volcano's destruction.|$|E
500|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> {{following}} the incident, a propaganda battle was waged between Boston's radicals {{and supporters of}} the government. Both sides published pamphlets that told strikingly different stories, which were principally published in London {{in a bid to}} influence opinion there. The Boston Gazette version of events, for example, characterized the massacre as part of an ongoing scheme to [...] "quell a Spirit of Liberty", and harped on the negative consequences of quartering troops in the city.|$|E

500|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> {{after the}} Baltimore Riot, {{newspapers}} and politicians {{across the country}} drew comparisons between the Massachusetts militia who had fought on April 19, 1775, {{at the start of}} the Revolution and the Massachusetts troops who fought on April 19, 1861. Among the 6th Massachusetts were descendants of those Minutemen who had fought in Lexington and Concord in 1775. Due to the coincidence of the date and the ancestry of some members, the 6th Massachusetts was often called the [...] "Minutemen of '61." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the 1939 Soviet {{invasion}} of Poland, {{resulting in the}} partition of Polish territory between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (USSR), Jewish communities in eastern Poland welcomed with some relief the Soviet occupation, which they saw as a [...] "lesser of two evils" [...] than openly antisemitic Nazi Germany. The image of Jews among the Belorussian and Ukrainian minorities waving red flags to welcome Soviet troops had great symbolic meaning in Polish memory of the period. Young Jews joined or organized communist militias, others organized a new, communist, temporary self-government. Such militias often disarmed and arrested Polish soldiers, policemen and other authority figures; often, Poles and the Polish states were mocked. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> following the events of September 1939, the Soviets engaged in a harsh policy of Sovietization. Polish schools and other institutions were closed, Poles were dismissed from jobs of authority, often arrested and deported, and replaced with non-Polish personnel.|$|E
500|$|American {{casualties}} in the battle were very light, and are therefore not listed in the table below. [...] Two Virginia officers, Capt. William Washington and Lt. James Monroe of the 3rd Virginia Regiment, were injured, as was James Buxton, an ensign in the 4th Virginia Regiment. [...] (Monroe, the future United States president, suffered a wound to the neck that very nearly killed him. [...] His life was saved by a doctor who volunteered his services to the army as it marched through New Jersey that morning.) Two privates {{are known to have}} died in the battle, and one account includes mention of two men dying from exposure on the march. [...] The most pessimistic estimate of American casualties lists four killed and eight wounded, although Fischer points out that many more American troops probably died of non-combat causes (including illness, hypothermia, malnutrition, and exhaustion) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> following the campaign of late December and early January.|$|E
2500|$|At low {{population}} densities, moths {{are found}} mating high above <b>the</b> ground, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest canopy. [...] Mating starts late <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> copulations are short. [...] In contrast, during high-density outbreaks, mating {{takes place on}} lower vegetation, presumably because caterpillars descend to forage in less defoliated areas, where they form their pupae. [...] This high population density increases the operational sex ratio and significantly intensifies male-male competition. As a result, copulations begin earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> last longer <b>in</b> an attempt to minimize sperm competition. In addition, such high densities enhance female opportunities for being selective regarding males.|$|R

Under the [...] "New Order" [...] regime, and sometimes used by the current government, the movement was usually referred to as [...] "G30S/PKI" [...] by those wanting to associate it with the PKI.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009, Palin {{expressed}} {{her support}} {{for the expansion of}} Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories, a position contrary to that of every U.S. Presidential administration in the past 40 years. In an interview with Barbara Walters, Palin stated, [...] "I believe that the Jewish settlements should be allowed to be expanded upon, because that population of Israel is going to grow. More and more Jewish people will be flocking to Israel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> and months ahead. And I don't think that the Obama administration has any right to tell Israel that the Jewish settlements cannot expand." ...|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} {{to examine the effects}} of coffee on performance <b>and</b> alertness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> at night. <b>The</b> results showed that caffeinated coffee had a beneficial effect on alertness and improved performance on a variety of tasks in both <b>day</b> <b>and</b> night sessions. <b>The</b> effects were often very large. For example, at night, consumption of caffeinated coffee produced comparable alertness ratings to the day-time ratings given when juice was drunk. <b>In</b> contrast to <b>the</b> effects of caffeinated coffee, the difference between the decaffeinated coffee and juice were small and variable. Overall, these results clearly demonstrate the beneficial effects of consuming caffeinated coffee, and show that this effect is comparable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> night...|$|R

[...] Sulkowicz says she sent the messages because she was upset and wanted to talk to Nungesser about the incident.|$|E
2500|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> {{leading up}} to Bear's collapse, the bank's CDS spread widened dramatically, {{indicating}} a surge of buyers taking out protection on the bank. [...] It has been suggested [...] that this widening {{was responsible for the}} perception that Bear Stearns was vulnerable, and therefore restricted its access to wholesale capital, which eventually led to its forced sale to JP Morgan in March. [...] An alternative view is that this surge in CDS protection buyers was a symptom rather than a cause of Bear's collapse; i.e., investors saw that Bear was in trouble, and sought to hedge any naked exposure to the bank, or speculate on its collapse.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the bombing}} of Pearl Harbor, the Civilian Conservation Corps camp {{contained}} within Griffith Park was converted to a holding center for Japanese Americans arrested as [...] "enemy aliens" [...] before they were transferred to more permanent internment camps. The Griffith Park Detention Camp opened almost immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack, taking in 35 Japanese immigrants suspected of fifth column activity because they lived and worked near military installations. These men, mostly fishermen from nearby Terminal Island, were transferred to an Immigration and Naturalization Service detention station after a brief stay, but Issei internees arrested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> following {{the outbreak of the}} war arrived soon after to take their place. Up to 550 Japanese Americans were confined in Griffith Park from 1941 to 1942, all subsequently transferred to Fort Lincoln, Fort Missoula and other DOJ camps.|$|E

2500|$|The 1883 {{eruption}} of Krakatoa in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) {{began in the}} afternoon of Sunday, 26 August 1883 (with origins as early as May of that year), and peaked in the late morning of Monday, 27 August when over 70% of the island and its surrounding archipelago were destroyed as it collapsed into a caldera. [...] Additional seismic activity {{was reported to have}} continued until February 1884, though reports of seismic activity after October 1883 were later dismissed by Rogier Verbeek's investigation into the eruption. The 1883 eruption was one of the deadliest and most destructive volcanic events in recorded history. At least 36,417 deaths are attributed to the eruption and the tsunamis it created. Significant additional effects were also felt around the world <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> after the volcano's destruction.|$|E
2500|$|Leon Czolgosz, a Polish American born in Alpena, Michigan, changed American {{history in}} 1901 by assassinating U.S. President William McKinley. Though Czolgosz was a {{native-born}} citizen, the American public displayed high anti-Polish and anti-immigrant sentiment after the attack. McKinley, {{who survived the}} shooting for several days, called Czolgosz a [...] "common murderer", and did not make mention of his background. Different Slavic groups debated his ethnic origins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> that followed the attack, and Hungarian Americans took effort to also distance themselves from him. Police who arrested him reported that Czolgosz himself identified as a Pole. The Polish American community in Buffalo was deeply ashamed and angry with the negative publicity that Czolgosz created, both for their community and the Pan-American Exposition, and canceled a Polish American parade following the attack. Polish Americans burned effigies of Czolgosz in Chicago and Polish American leaders publicly repudiated him.|$|E
2500|$|The Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company's {{interim report}} stated that Japan's {{response}} was flawed by [...] "poor communication and delays in releasing data on dangerous radiation leaks at the facility". The report blamed Japan's central government {{as well as}} TEPCO, [...] "depicting a scene of harried officials incapable of making decisions to stem radiation leaks as the situation at the coastal plant worsened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> following the disaster". The report said poor planning worsened the disaster response, noting that authorities had [...] "grossly underestimated tsunami risks" [...] that followed the magnitude 9.0 earthquake. The 12.1 metre (40ft) high tsunami that struck the plant was double {{the height of the}} highest wave predicted by officials. The erroneous assumption that the plant's cooling system would function after the tsunami worsened the disaster. [...] "Plant workers had no clear instructions on how to respond to such a disaster, causing miscommunication, especially when the disaster destroyed backup generators." ...|$|E
