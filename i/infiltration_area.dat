High-resolution SP surveys conducted with nonpolarizing electrodes can reliably detect potential differences as small as a few mV over relatively small areas, suggesting that the technique can find wider use in monitoring biodeg-radation processes, mapping effluent plumes, and identifying local preferential <b>infiltration</b> <b>areas.</b> Surface SP measurements appear to respond to changes in the oxidation-reduction potential in shallow reactors, correlating best with changes in dissolved oxygen concentration and measured electrical potential within the subsurface reactors.

In these dune systems, dune-forms (featuring dry podzols or undifferentiated soils) such as parabolic dunes and longitudinal dunes alternate with vast deflation planes (featuring wet podzols) with multiple moorland pools.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the water balance of a landfill is crucial for its management, as the waste water content is the main factor influencing the biodegradation process of organic waste. In order to investigate the ability of long electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles to detect zones of high infiltration in a landfill cover layer, low resolution time lapse data were acquired during a rainfall event. Working at low resolution allows to cover large field areas but with the drawback of limiting quantitative interpretation. In this contribution, we use synthetic modeling to quantify the effect of the following issues commonly encountered when dealing with field scale ERT data: (i) the effect of low resolution on electrical resistivity changes interpretation, (ii) the effect of the original heterogeneous resistivity distribution on the observed relative resistivity changes, (iii) the need for temperature and pore fluid conductivity data in order to compute water content and absolute changes of water content, and (iv) the interpretation error commonly made while neglecting the dilution effect during fresh water infiltration. Firstly, {{due to the lack of}} spatial resolution, the regularized inversion process yields a smoothed distribution of resistivity changes that fail to detect small infiltration zones and yields an overestimation of the infiltration depth and an underestimation of the infiltrated volume in large <b>infiltration</b> <b>areas.</b> Secondly, the analysis of relative changes, as commonly used in literature, is not adequate when the background water content is highly heterogeneous. In such a case, relative changes reflect both the initial water content distribution and the observed changes. Thirdly, the computation of absolute water content changes better reflects the infiltration pattern, but requires spatially distributed temperature and pore fluid conductivity input data. Lastly, the dilution effect, if not considered, leads to an underestimation of the infiltrated volume. Taking into account these elements, we extracted the maximum amount of information from our field data without over-interpreting the results. This allowed the detection of larger <b>infiltration</b> <b>areas</b> possibly responsible for a large part of the annual water infiltration and landfill gas loss...|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Arquitectura Paisagista - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThis master {{dissertation}} aims to study mass movements dynamics and its classification, {{as well as}} the identification of the factors that control and initiate them. These concepts and knowledge were applied to the district of Angra do Heroísmo in Terceira´s island of the Azores in order to elaborate a map where the areas showing susceptibility to mass movements were identified. This identification and mapping of mass movements is a contribution to the planning and management of the municipality territory, where the natural conditions are favorable to the geomorphic instability. The misadjusted human actions in this vulnerable region can improve the landscape instability. There are several causes for the mass movements starting. Usually, the beginning of a mass movement is attributed to a single factor, as for instance an unusual precipitation, however this does not correspond to the reality, as a complex number of factors are involved. It was given highlight in this study to the human action as a trigger factor, that in a perspective of sustainable management and development, allow to understand how devastation and significant can be his action. In a perspective of identifying the impact of human actions in the mass movements, {{as well as the}} characterization of the geomorphic susceptibility of the area in study, the maximum <b>infiltration</b> <b>areas</b> were delimitated. The maximum <b>infiltration</b> <b>areas</b> {{are one of the most}} important territory management figures to preserve, and several times have misadjusted human occupation. In order to delimitate these areas, as well as to elaborate the mass movements susceptibility map for the district of Angra do Heroísmo, several physical characteristics of the region were analysed: geology/lithology, volcanic activity and seismicity, geomorphology, soils, etc. The Permeability of the geologic formations and the soils was also evaluated. Intervention actions for the area were recommended to implement in the most instable areas, in order to promote its protection, conservation or recuperation. These measures are considered crucial to maintain the balance of the Landscape, and prevent the occurrence of possible catastrophic events...|$|R

Here we aimed to present an autopsy case of disseminated angioinvasive aspergillosis with diabetes mellitus and discuss the other possible underlying reasons for this situation. A 52 year old man with diabetes mellitus operated for the fracture of his L 1 vertebra and tibia due to falling down from the third floor of a building. After his death on postoperative 34 th day, histopathologic examination of the tissue samples presented multiple hyphae having dichotomous branching at 45 -degree angles in <b>infiltration</b> <b>areas.</b> In conclusion, in long-term hospitalized patients with diabetes mellitus, fungal infections should be taken into account and an empirical antifungal therapy is recommended.

This approach is however soon bounded {{in the case of a}} dynamic process, such as the hydrological hazard. The overlay of different data gives a valuable appreciation of the streaming surfaces, but this remains insufficient to express the spatial dynamics of the flow. The global sensibility of a basin is not merely the sum of the local sensibilities.

40|$|In recent decades, {{groundwater}} {{resources of}} the high Vicenza plain were subjected to an increasing extraction rate and, at the same time, to a lower quantity of groundwater recharge. The result is a decreasing flow from the plain springs and a high reduction in piezometric levels of the middle and lower Venetian aquifers. In order to restore the balance of groundwater resources in the Vicenza area, the Vicenza Province has promoted experimental activities aimed to increase the recharge of the aquifer in the high Vicenza plain and in the River Agno valley, using infiltration wells, forested <b>infiltration</b> <b>areas,</b> <b>infiltration</b> trenches, subsurface fields and infiltration canals. All recharge plants are fed by irrigation water, managed by agricultural consortia only during periods of water surplus. Construction works were preceded by specific geological and hydrogeological investigations to verify the suitability for recharge, {{with the purpose of}} optimizing the available economic resources. For the protection of the aquifer system, a chemical background of infiltration water was assessed with periodical chemical-physical and microbiological surveys. After the activation date, a monthly monitoring program started to verify the quality of both surface and groundwater, collecting samples in monitoring wells downstream the infiltration structures. The input flow rate entering the various systems, monitored by automatic instruments either in the superficial structure and in groundwater, have provided interesting information about the volumes and the quality of water.
