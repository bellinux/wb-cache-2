5|$|Jackson reluctantly {{supported}} Al Gore when {{he became}} the <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee,</b> saying Gore and his running mate Joe Lieberman were not liberal enough but that he supported Gore as the only alternative to George W.

5|$|Kennedy's staff drew up {{detailed}} {{plans for}} a candidacy in the 1984 presidential election that he considered, but with his family opposed and his realization that the Senate was a fully satisfying career, in late 1982 {{he decided not to}} run. Kennedy campaigned hard for <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee</b> Walter Mondale and defended vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro from criticism over being a pro-choice Catholic, but Reagan was re-elected in a landslide.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} the {{hurricane}} caused <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee</b> Michael Dukakis to cancel a rally and two fund-raising events in New Orleans. Governor Buddy Roemer issued for the Louisiana National Guard to be on standby for emergency duty. Officials closed several bridges across southeastern Louisiana and also canceled ferry travel across Lake Ponchartrain.

5|$|Martha Layne Collins (née Hall; born December 7, 1936) is an American former businesswoman and {{politician}} {{from the}} U.S. state of Kentucky; she was elected as the state's 56th governor from 1983 to 1987, {{the first woman}} to hold the office and the only one to date.

5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that {{participants}} had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee</b> John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media. Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state {{that it is not}} clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Upon graduating, Harding had stints as {{a teacher}} and as an {{insurance}} man, and made a brief attempt at studying law. He then raised $300 in partnership with others to purchase a failing newspaper, The Marion Star, weakest of the growing city's three papers, and its only daily. The 18-year-old Harding used the railroad pass that came with the paper to attend the 1884 Republican National Convention, where he hobnobbed with better-known journalists and supported the presidential nominee, former Secretary of State James G. Blaine. Harding returned from Chicago to find that the paper had been reclaimed by the sheriff. During the election campaign, Harding worked for the Marion Democratic Mirror and was annoyed at having to praise the <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee,</b> New York Governor Grover Cleveland, who won the election. Afterward, with the financial aid of his father, the budding newspaperman redeemed the paper.|$|E
5|$|Willkie became {{active in}} the Akron Democratic Party, {{becoming}} prominent enough while still with Firestone to introduce the <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee,</b> Ohio Governor James M. Cox, {{when he came to}} town during the 1920 campaign. He was a delegate to the 1924 Democratic National Convention, and supported New York Governor Al Smith through the record 103 ballots, when the nomination fell to former West Virginia congressman John W. Davis. More important to Willkie, though, was a fight against the Ku Klux Klan, which had become powerful in much of the nation and in the Democratic Party, but he and other delegates were unsuccessful in their attempt to include a plank in the party platform condemning the Klan. He also backed a proposed plank in support of the League of Nations that ultimately failed. In 1925, Willkie led a successful effort to oust Klan members on the Akron school board.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{instructed}} Agnew {{to avoid}} personal {{attacks on the}} press and the <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee,</b> South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on what might happen in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting busing, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental health treatment, the president renewed those instructions for the new candidate, Sargent Shriver.|$|E

25|$|The 2008 result made Barack Obama {{the first}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee</b> to sweep all 10 of New Hampshire's counties. Obama even won a {{majority}} of the vote in traditionally staunchly Republican Carroll County, the only county in New Hampshire (and in all of New England) to have voted for Republican Barry Goldwater in the 1964 Democratic landslide. This is despite Obama's 10-point margin being considerably lower than Lyndon B. Johnson's 28-point margin. Carroll County had not given a majority to a <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee</b> since 1888, although vote-splitting last allowed Woodrow Wilson to win a plurality there in 1912. As of 2017, this is the last election in which Rockingham County, Belknap County, and Carroll County voted for the Democratic candidate.|$|E
