5|$|On 8 November 1949 she {{was sold}} to Arnott Young & Co Ltd for scrapping. By August 1950, the ship{{breakers}} had removed the damaged section, and refloated her after-end. The after-end {{was taken to the}} breakers yard in Dalmuir for further inspection, but the <b>fore-end</b> was broken up where it lay on the beach.|$|E
25|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} Contender is how the barrel is {{attached}} to the frame. By removing the <b>fore-end,</b> a large hinge pin is exposed; by pushing this hinge pin out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber or length can be installed and pinned in place, the <b>fore-end</b> replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for this change.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, the 1907 was updated by Winchester {{with a much}} thicker <b>fore-end</b> (eliminating the {{cracking}} problems common to the earlier models) and stock. The newer model also had a redesigned charging handle which {{made it easier to}} lock the bolt back.|$|E
25|$|Pistol grips, butt {{stocks and}} <b>fore-ends</b> {{have been made}} {{available}} in stained walnut, or in recoil reducing composite materials. Different pistol <b>fore-ends</b> are required for the octagonal versus the round versus the bull barrels. The <b>fore-ends</b> have had an assortment of either one or two screw attachment points, used for attaching the <b>fore-ends</b> to the barrel with its matching one or two attachment points. Universally, the <b>fore-ends,</b> in addition to attaching to the barrel, cover the single hinge pin that connects the barrel to the receiver.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fore-ends</b> tend to vary both in thickness, {{from the}} {{splinter}} <b>fore-ends</b> common on British side-by-side shotguns to the wide, flat bottomed beavertail <b>fore-ends</b> found on benchrest shooting guns, and in length, from the short AK-47 style {{to the long}} Mannlicher stock that runs {{all the way to}} the muzzle. Most common on sporting firearms is the half-stock, which extends roughly half the length of the barrel.|$|R
50|$|The {{top part}} of the fitted hammer forged barrels (until c. 1975) from Lyttleton, were encased by a handgueard, while M&S 1/3 MOA rear sights were installed. Parker Hale 1/4 MOA rear sights were {{available}} as an option. Stocks were made of unimpressive, but dense and strong beech wood. The handguard is absent from later models, which had significantly bulkier <b>fore-ends</b> to allow for an open barrel with effective cooling while still reducing potential fliers due to contact between the free floated barrel and the shooter's fingers. Accurate Musgrave-manufactured button rifled barrels (with a slightly longer, parallel nox) were usually matched with these stocks.|$|R
25|$|During the air raid, she was hit {{directly}} by either {{one or two}} bombs; one struck {{the vicinity of the}} bulkhead, between compartments X1 and X11, breaking off the <b>fore-end</b> just behind her No. 2 gun pivot. A later bomb hit her aft, fracturing the stern aft of her No. 4 gun position and causing her quarterdecks to hang at an angle. At this point, numerous holes and cracks had formed in the hull, causing her to flood with water and sink to the bottom. Later on a crane from the nearby dockyard would fall across her deck, above her after motor room. After the war, on 21 January 1948, the Weser Port Salvage Authorities called for tenders to assist in her breaking up. A number of quotations were given, ranging from 130,000 to 200,000 Reichsmark, and from four to 13 months' duration. Eventually a contract was placed on 17 February 1948, with Deutsches Dampfschiffahrts Hansa, for 132,000 RM and eight months work. Her breaking up was finished on February 1949.|$|E
500|$|The Winchester Model 1200 came in barrel {{lengths of}} 30-inch, and 28-inch with a fixed choke or the Win-choke screw in choke tubes system {{and is a}} 12, 16, or 20-gauge, {{manually}} operated, slide action shotgun. [...] The slide action, {{also known as a}} pump-action, means that the shotgun has a moving bolt system which is operated by a [...] "wooden or composite slide called the fore-end". [...] The <b>fore-end</b> is located {{on the underside of the}} barrel and moves front to back. [...] The weapon can hold a maximum of five rounds total with four in the tubular magazine and one in the chamber. [...] It has a hammerless action which means that there is no external hammer spur. [...] There is only a firing pin which strikes the primer on the shell to ignite the powder in the round.|$|E
2500|$|Configurations of grips {{and stocks}} for riot {{shotguns}} vary widely, but often feature reinforced plastic [...] "furniture" [...] {{instead of the}} wood common on hunting firearms. Wood was used for riot gun stocks in the past, and sometimes still is. As compared to hunting shotguns, riot guns more often feature pistol grips, {{with or without a}} shoulder stock. Without a shoulder stock (or with a folding stock), a riot shotgun becomes more compact and thus is able to be brought to bear more rapidly in very close quarters. With the stock, the pistol grip facilitates control of the weapon and provides a more ergonomic grip when the shotgun is fired from the shoulder. Foregrips, or forends, also vary, often with the inclusion of a pistol-grip <b>fore-end</b> (further increasing control and absorbing recoil), and/or the addition of an accessory rail or other mounting point for a tactical light.|$|E
5000|$|Pump-action {{shotguns}}, {{also called}} [...] "slide-action repeating shotguns" [...] or [...] "slide-action shotguns" [...] are {{a class of}} shotguns that are distinguished {{in the way in}} which spent shells are extracted and fresh ones are chambered. The weapon has a single barrel above a tube magazine into which shells are inserted. New shells are chambered by pulling a pump handle (often called the forend) attached to the tube magazine toward the user, then pushing it back into place to chamber the cartridge (in a few cases this action is reversed). <b>Fore-ends</b> are replaceable, and modern ones may include a pistol grip for a more secure hold, picatinny rails, or a tactical light.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} Contender is {{now known}} as the generation one (G1) Contender and was replaced by the G2 Contender in 1998. The new design is dimensionally the same as the original Contender, but uses an Encore-style trigger group. Due to the changes in the trigger mechanism, and to differences in the angle of the grip relative to the boreline of the gun, the buttstocks and pistol grips are different between the G1 and G2 Contenders and will not interchange. The G2 uses essentially the same barrels and <b>fore-ends</b> as the original Contender and barrels will interchange, with the only two exceptions being the G2 muzzleloading barrels, which will only fit the G2 frame, and the Herrett barrels/fore-ends, which are specific for use only on a G1 frame.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Contender, {{now known}} as the generation one (G1) Contender, was replaced by the G2 Contender soon after the Encore came out. The G2 Contender is essentially dimensionally the same as the original Contender, but uses an Encore style trigger group. Due to the changes in the trigger mechanism, and to differences in the angle of the grip relative to the boreline of the gun, the buttstocks and pistol grips are different between the G1 and G2 Contenders and will not interchange.

60|$|The man stooped {{over the}} case; handed barrels, stock, and <b>fore-end</b> to Strickland, who fitted all together, yawning dolefully. Then {{he reached down}} to the gun-case, took a solid-drawn cartridge, and slipped it into the breech of the '360 Express.|$|E
5000|$|The {{attempt to}} sink three old cruisers, {{to block the}} flow of traffic {{in and out of}} the Port of Bruges-Zeebrugge failed. The failure of the attack on the Zeebrugge mole {{resulted}} in heavy German fire on the three blocking ships, , [...] and , which were filled with concrete. Thetis did not make it to the canal entrance, after it hit an obstruction and was scuttled prematurely. The two other ships were sunk at the narrowest point of the canal. The submarines C1 under Lieut. A.C Newbold and C3 under Lieut. R.D. Sandford were old, each with a volunteer crew of one other officer and four ratings. They had five tons of amatol packed into their <b>fore-ends</b> and were to be driven into the viaduct and then blown up, to prevent reinforcement of the German garrison on the mole. The crews were to abandon their submarines shortly before the collision with the viaduct, leaving the submarines to steer themselves automatically. During the passage from Dover, C1 parted with its tow and arrived too late to take part in the operation. Sandford, commanding C3, elected to steer his ship into the viaduct manually instead of depending on the automatic system.|$|R
60|$|Immediately before her, {{in strange}} {{contrast}} to this lifeless landscape, lay the peopled mere, fringed around with dead reeds standing so {{still in the}} frosty air {{that they might have}} been painted things. On this mere half the population of Leyden seemed to be gathered; at least there were thousands of them, shouting, laughing, and skimming to and fro in their bright garments like flocks of gay-plumaged birds. Among them, drawn by horses with bells tied to their harness, glided many sledges of wickerwork and wood mounted upon iron runners, their <b>fore-ends</b> fashioned to quaint shapes, such as the heads of dogs or bulls, or Tritons. Then there were vendors of cakes and sweetmeats, vendors of spirits also, who did a good trade on this cold day. Beggars too were numerous, and among them deformities, who, nowadays, would be hidden in charitable homes, slid about in wooden boxes, which they pushed along with crutches. Lastly many loafers had gathered there with stools for fine ladies to sit on while the skates were bound to their pretty feet, and chapmen with these articles for sale and straps wherewith to fasten them. To complete the picture the huge red ball of the sun was sinking to the west, and opposite to it the pale full moon began already to gather light and life.|$|R
60|$|CRASH! It smashed with {{an immense}} report. It had fallen among the {{grounded}} Asiatic aeroplanes that lay among the turf and flower-beds near the river. They flew in scraps and fragments, turf, trees, and gravel leapt and fell; the aeronauts still lying along the canal bank were thrown about like sacks, catspaws flew across the foaming water. All {{the windows of}} the hotel hospital that had been shiningly reflecting blue sky and airships the moment before became vast black stars. Bang!--a second followed. Bert looked up and was filled with a sense of a number of monstrous bodies swooping down, coming down on the whole affair like a flight of bellying blankets, like a string of vast dish-covers. The central tangle of the battle above was circling down as if to come into touch with the power-house fight. He got a new effect of airships altogether, as vast things coming down upon him, growing swiftly larger and larger and more overwhelming, until the houses over the way seemed small, the American rapids narrow, the bridge flimsy, the combatants infinitesimal. As they came down they became audible as a complex of shootings and vast creakings and groanings and beatings and throbbings and shouts and shots. The fore-shortened black eagles at the <b>fore-ends</b> of the Germans had an effect of actual combat of flying feathers.|$|R
6000|$|The man stooped {{over the}} case, banded barrels, stock, and <b>fore-end</b> to Strickland, who fitted them together. Yawning dolefully, then {{he reached down}} to the gun-case, took a solid drawn cartridge, and slipped it into the breech of the [...] .360 express.|$|E
60|$|He found himself, with an {{enormous}} sense of relief and warmth, in the passage. The passage was behaving like a dice-box, its disposition was evidently to rattle him about and then throw him out again. He hung on with the convulsive clutch of instinct until the passage lurched down ahead. Then {{he would make a}} short run cabin-ward, and clutch again as the <b>fore-end</b> rose.|$|E
6000|$|... "We have caulked all hatches and {{gratings}} forward, {{and stopped}} the ventilators," [...] he said. [...] "I reckon the water will leave the deck {{long enough for the}} pump to give her <b>fore-end</b> some buoyancy. If she rises with the flood tide, well heave the cables aft, until we can get a hold that will lift her bow from the ground. Then you can pump out the fore hold and we'll make a fresh start aft. We'll soon know if Cartwright's notion is correct." ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} they all had gained {{the end of the}} yard-arm, slipped down the rope, and got upon the raft, but it was {{difficult}} to hold on, because at each heave of the ship, the <b>fore-end</b> of the raft was raised quite out of the sea, and then let fall with considerable violence. As soon as Sam reached it, he bade Robin cut adrift with his axe, so great was the heave; but at the moment the raft hung almost perpendicularly in the air, and Robin could do nothing but cling to the rope that bound it. Next instant it again fell flat on the sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "One of my {{hungry and}} forbearing friends was {{sounding}} in the bows just below me. This steamboat was {{exactly like a}} decked scow. On the deck there were two little teak-wood houses, with doors and windows. The boiler was in the <b>fore-end,</b> and the machinery right astern. Over the whole {{there was a light}} roof, supported on stanchions. The funnel projected through that roof, and in front of the funnel a small cabin built of light planks served for a pilot-house. It contained a couch, two camp-stools, a loaded Martini-Henry leaning in one corner, a tiny table, and the steering-wheel. It had a wide door in front and a broad shutter at each side. All these were always thrown open, of course. I spent my days perched up there on the extreme <b>fore-end</b> of that roof, before the door. At night I slept, or tried to, on the couch. An athletic black belonging to some coast tribe, and educated by my poor predecessor, was the helmsman. He sported a pair of brass earrings, wore a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and thought all the world of himself. He was the most unstable kind of fool I had ever seen. He steered with no end of a swagger while you were by; but if he lost sight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject funk, and would let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a minute.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Weel, aweel, sirs,' said Jabos, whose hard-headed and uncultivated shrewdness seemed {{sometimes}} {{to start the}} game when others beat the bush--'weel, weel, ye may be a' mista'en yet; I'll never believe that a man would lay a plan to shoot another wi' his ain gun. Lord help ye, I was the keeper's assistant down at the Isle mysell, and I'll uphaud it the biggest man in Scotland shouldna take a gun frae me or I had weized the slugs through him, though I'm but sic a little feckless body, fit for naething but the outside o' a saddle and the <b>fore-end</b> o' a poschay; na, na, nae living man wad venture on that.

6000|$|It {{was only}} very slowly {{that he began}} to realise the peculiarities of his position, to {{perceive}} that the breaking down of the arch between Green Island and the mainland had cut him off completely from the world. Indeed it was only when he came back to where the <b>fore-end</b> of the Hohenzollern lay like a stranded ship, and was contemplating the shattered bridge, that this dawned upon him. Even then it came with no sort of shock to his mind, a fact among a number of other extraordinary and unmanageable facts. He stared at the shattered cabins of the Hohenzollern and its widow's garment of dishevelled silk for a time, but without any idea of its containing any living thing; it was all so twisted and smashed and entirely upside down. Then for a while he gazed at the evening sky. A cloud haze was now appearing and not an airship was in sight. A swallow flew by and snapped some invisible victim. [...] "Like a dream," [...] he repeated.|$|E
60|$|Wasub's body swung {{over the}} sea with {{extended}} arms. Lingard caught up the sculls, and as the dinghy darted away from the brig's side he had a complete view of the lighted poop--Shaw leaning massively over the taffrail in sulky dejection, the flare bearers erect and rigid, the heads along the rail, the eyes staring after him above the bulwarks. The <b>fore-end</b> of the brig was wrapped in a lurid and sombre mistiness; the sullen mingling of darkness and of light; her masts pointing straight up could be tracked by torn gleams and vanished above as if the trucks had been tall enough to pierce the heavy mass of vapours motionless overhead. She was beautifully precious. His loving eyes saw her floating at rest in a wavering halo, between an invisible sky and an invisible sea, like a miraculous craft suspended in the air. He turned his head away as if the sight had been {{too much for him}} at the moment of separation, and, as soon as his little boat had passed beyond the limit of the light thrown upon the water, he perceived very low in the black void of the west the stern lantern of the yacht shining feebly like a star about to set, unattainable, infinitely remote--belonging to another universe.|$|E
6000|$|... "They loaded us at last. We shipped a crew. Eight able seamen and two boys. We {{hauled off}} one evening to the buoys at the dock-gates, {{ready to go}} out, and with a fair {{prospect}} of beginning the voyage next day. Mrs. Beard was to start for home by a late train. When the ship was fast we went to tea. We sat rather silent through the meal--Mahon, the old couple, and I. I finished first, and slipped away for a smoke, my cabin being in a deck-house just against the poop. It was high water, blowing fresh with a drizzle; the double dock-gates were opened, and the steam colliers were {{going in and out}} in the darkness with their lights burning bright, a great plashing of propellers, rattling of winches, and a lot of hailing on the pier-heads. I watched the procession of head-lights gliding high and of green lights gliding low in the night, when suddenly a red gleam flashed at me, vanished, came into view again, and remained. The <b>fore-end</b> of a steamer loomed up close. I shouted down the cabin, 'Come up, quick!' and then heard a startled voice saying afar in the dark, 'Stop her, sir.' A bell jingled. Another voice cried warningly, 'We are going right into that barque, sir.' The answer to this was a gruff 'All right,' and the next thing was a heavy crash as the steamer struck a glancing blow with the bluff of her bow about our fore-rigging. There was a moment of confusion, yelling, and running about. Steam roared. Then somebody was heard saying, 'All clear, sir.'... 'Are you all right?' asked the gruff voice. I had jumped forward to see the damage, and hailed back, 'I think so.' 'Easy astern,' said the gruff voice. A bell jingled. 'What steamer is that?' screamed Mahon. By that time she was no more to us than a bulky shadow maneuvering a little way off. They shouted at us some name--a woman's name, Miranda or Melissa--or some such thing. 'This means another month in this beastly hole,' said Mahon to me, as we peered with lamps about the splintered bulwarks and broken braces. 'But where's the captain?' ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{is indeed}} a minute proportion, but {{it might have been}} my luck; and since I am writing in eulogy of seamen I feel irresistibly tempted to talk about this unique specimen; not indeed to offer him as an example of morality, but to bring out certain {{characteristics}} and set out a certain point of view. He was a large, strong man with a guileless countenance, not very communicative with his shipmates, but when drawn into any sort of conversation displaying a very painstaking earnestness. He was fair and candid-eyed, of a very satisfactory smartness, and, from the officer- of-the-watch point of view,--altogether dependable. Then, suddenly, he went and stole. And he didn't go away from his honourable kind to do that thing to somebody on shore; he stole right there on the spot, in proximity to his shipmates, on board his own ship, with complete disregard for old Brown, our night watchman (whose fame for trustworthiness was utterly blasted {{for the rest of the}} voyage) and in such a way as to bring the profoundest possible trouble to all the blameless souls animating that ship. He stole eleven golden sovereigns, and a gold pocket chronometer and chain. I am really in doubt whether the crime should not be entered under the category of sacrilege rather than theft. Those things belonged to the captain! There was certainly something in the nature of the violation of a sanctuary, and of a particularly impudent kind, too, because he got his plunder out of the captain's state-room while the captain was asleep there. But look, now, at the fantasy of the man! After going through the pockets of the clothes, he did not hasten to retreat. No. He went deliberately into the saloon and removed from the sideboard two big heavy, silver-plated lamps, which he carried to the <b>fore-end</b> of the ship and stood symmetrically on the knight-heads. This, I must explain, means that he took them away as far as possible from the place where they belonged. These were the deeds of darkness. In the morning the bo'sun came along dragging after him a hose to wash the foc'sle head, and, beholding the shiny cabin lamps, resplendent in the morning light, one on each side of the bowsprit, he was paralysed with awe. He dropped the nozzle from his nerveless hands--and such hands, too! I happened along, and he said to me in a distracted whisper: [...] "Look at that, sir, look." [...] "Take them back aft at once yourself," [...] I said, very amazed, too. As we approached the quarterdeck we perceived the steward, a prey to a sort of sacred horror, holding up before us the captain's trousers.|$|E
