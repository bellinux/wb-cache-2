40|$|This study tests grouted splices {{connected}} by {{two types of}} sleeves, namely Welded Bar Sleeve (WBS) and Tapered <b>Head</b> <b>Sleeve</b> (THS). These sleeves are made from non-proprietary pipe sections, where (a) WBS is fabricated by welding the deformed bars to the inner wall of the pipe, and (b) THS is made tapered with smaller openings at both ends. To study the behavior, the splice specimens were tested under incremental tensile load at various bar embedded lengths and sleeve diameters. The degree of confinement generated in the sleeve is found to increase with decreasing sleeve diameter. This improves the bond strength in sleeve, which subsequently increases the tensile capacity of the splice. THS gives a 30 % higher tensile capacity compared with WBS. With the active confinement, the required bar embedded length of the splice {{can be reduced to}} 8 times the bar diameter. An analytical model is formulated {{on the basis of the}} confinement stress as expressed in a function of sleeve dimensions. The model is used to predict the tensile capacities of the splices at a variation range of ± 10 % of the experimental results. This verifies the correlations among the sleeve dimensions, the confinement stress and bond strength of the grouted splice...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} a developed computational model {{to study a}} stress-strain state of the assembly unit components of a medium-speed diesel engine of new generation, type CH 26. 5 / 31, which comprises a cylinder <b>head,</b> a <b>sleeve,</b> a gasket, a block, two mounting studs and four power studs. The developed three-dimensional finite element model {{presented in this article}} allows us to take into consideration all the components that make up a gas joint, regardless of their geometric complexity. Its use enables us to estimate the cylinder head - gasket - sleeve tightness of sealing when applying the mounting, temperature, and gas loads, to define the stress and strain components of parts, as well as to study the gasket condition, including pressure distribution across its surface. Based on the results obtained in the study the finite element model of the cylinder head was modified considering a more detailed description of its geometry, thus reducing the principal tensile stresses. </p...|$|R

25|$|The Shoulders: the Neapolitan jacket has no {{shoulder}} padding. Neapolitan tailors {{removed the}} shoulder padding from their jackets {{in order to}} provide more freedom of movement. For this reason, the Neapolitan shoulder on informal jackets is sewn like a shirt sleeve (“spalla a camicia”) and it follows the natural curve of the human body rather than give it shape. This type of sleeve is cut about 10 cm larger than the armhole, and it can be finished with the “repecchia” – that visually interesting shirring the tailor creates with the extra fabric. This little flair, which supposedly allows for even more freedom of movement, is known as “manica a mappina”, and it gives the jacket a beautiful “rugged” appearance. For formal occasions, the Neapolitan shoulder features a “rollino” – a little roll of padding that raises the <b>sleeve</b> <b>head</b> to drape more cleanly.|$|R

50|$|Hiding one's breasts {{is likely}} the most {{challenging}} piece of the gender illusion puzzle for a drag king. While some are small-breasted and may succeed using a tight sports bra, many kings resort {{to one of the}} following, or several of the following used in conjunction with other methods: Ace bandages; duct tape; soft, hard, or ribbed back braces (worn backwards); and compression shirts and vests. Some use a method involving cutting a hole in the crotch of pantyhose for the <b>head</b> and making <b>sleeves</b> out the legs. This creates a tight stocking shirt that compresses the breasts. Duct tape is the most skin damaging method of binding. Prolonged use has resulted, in some cases, of tearing off skin and excessive blister after removal, or stretching of the breast tissue and skin after long-term use. Another damaging binding technique, but more immediately so, is the use of cling wrap. This method has caused Kings to fall unconscious while performing.|$|R

40|$|The {{separation}} of the design and technical roles within commercial knitwear design {{has led to a}} 'technical skills gap' between designers and industrial knitting technology, which has contributed to the communication problems between designers and technicians. Historically, these issues have been ignored and designers have accepted compromised versions of their original ideas. However, the advent of seamless knitting technology has exacerbated the issue and the skills gap has grown exponentially, as designers struggle to engage with seamless knitting processes. The nature of seamless garment design is that all aspects must be considered simultaneously, and pattern-­‐cutting principles for two-­‐dimensional garment blanks are no longer relevant. The most crucial aspect of the design process is the programming of the garment, from which designers are generally excluded. The complexity of the programming has led to manufacturers creating wizard-­‐based functions that simplify and speed up the process, and produce standardised garment styles. The database of pre‐programmed garment styles has been held responsible for uniformity of garment silhouettes within the commercial fashion industry. This research develops a craft theory, that has broadly developed from David Pye and Peter Dormer’s seminal work up to the 1990 s, and locates it in relation to more contemporary work on digital craft. Programming is acknowledged as a form of digital craft and the Shima Seiki APEX CAD system and SWG-­‐N knitting machine are the craft tools. The creative experimental practice explores the possibilities of taking control of the programming and knitting of seamless garments, in terms of the creative design development of new seamless <b>sleeve</b> <b>head</b> styles. The practice is carried out within an 'experimental system' away from the constraints of industry. The data from semi-­‐structured interviews with commercial knitwear designers and technicians is discussed in relation to the 'communication bottleneck' identified by Claudia Eckert and the 'technology skills gap' identified by Sayer et al. Four scenarios for the design and manufacture of knitwear are identified and analysed in terms of the creative management of the design and sampling of seamless garments. The outcomes reflect on how the roles of designer and technician could be more interchangeable to better exploit seamless knitting technology. Concurrent design practices are considered in the light of a new slow fashion framework that exploits the new possibilities afforded by seamless knitting technology. This study presents the case that the design and technical aspects of knitwear design need to be reunited in order to create innovative seamless garments, and that this could either be as one role, such as technical designer, or within a design team made up of designer and technician. The artifacts created as part of this research illustrate the possibilities of a designer taking control of the whole process, and are products of a design methodology that incorporates digital tools with traditional design skills. However, it is acknowledged that to fully exploit the software one needs to be an expert craftsman, which, due to the complexity of the software, can take many years to achieve. Therefore, the culture of the knitwear industry needs change to actively encourage and facilitate teamwork, and the training of designers and technicians needs to reflect this change, if seamless knitting technology is to be fully exploited...|$|R
