5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa near Dakar on August 31. It moved westward into the <b>Intertropical</b> <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone,</b> and organized into a tropical disturbance on September 2 with a small, circular area of convection. The system moved to the west, and on September 3, the convection diminished after moving west of 40° W. By the next day, the tropical disturbance was barely discernible from the clouds of the <b>Intertropical</b> <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone.</b> The wave gradually became detached from the ITCZ, and based on a reconnaissance flight that confirmed the existence of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on September 5 while located 255 miles (415 km) east of Grenada.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Five-E formed {{out of a}} weak {{tropical}} wave, {{associated with}} scattered convection, which formed {{off the coast of}} Africa on June 23. The wave was moving towards the west at the rate of 23mph (37km/h), due to an area of high pressure located over the north-central Atlantic Ocean leading to a prevailing easterly flow. Some cyclonic turning was noted and convection was {{on either side of the}} axis the center of the stormbut was mainly in association with the <b>Intertropical</b> <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone</b> (ITCZ).

In many cases, we observed a close relationship between the inter-bubble distance and the horizontal wavelength of the MSTIDs. The MSTIDs followed by EPBs occurred primarily in the afternoon to evening period under strong tropospheric convective activities (cold fronts and/or <b>intertropical</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>zones).</b> The close relationship between EPBs and MSTIDs suggests that MSTIDs {{could be one of the}} seeding sources of EPBs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The eastern Pacic and Atlantic <b>Intertropical</b> <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zones</b> (ITCZ) {{exhibit the}} largest year-to-year {{variations}} in boreal spring. We show {{evidence suggesting that}} Atlantic ITCZ April-May variability is linked to that for the eastern Pacic through the Walker circulation as it respond to changes in equatorial Pacic convection. Analy-sis of ITCZ proxy indices shows the link appears to be strong in the 1980 - 90 ’s and 1920 - 30 ’s but virtually nonexistent in the 1950 - 60 ’s. We argue that this apparent nonstationarity results from the nonlinear relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and convection in the eastern equatorial Paci c and its consequent eect on the Walker circulation and the Atlantic ITCZ. This mechanism was modulated over 1856 - 1998 by interdecadal changes in peak SST attained in the eastern equatorial Pacic during boreal spring...|$|R

40|$|Aquarius {{satellite}} salinity {{measurements are}} resolving the major global and regional spatial patterns, and temporal variations, {{since the start}} of routine data collection on 25 August 2011. This description includes the principal seasonal variations over the first annual cycle as observed by the mission. In particular, we identify the evolution of low salinity anomalies associated with the Atlantic and Pacific <b>intertropical</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>zones</b> (ITCZ), major river outflows such as the Amazon, a seasonal low salinity anomaly in the Panama bight, and other features. We also explore the links that the salinity variations have with precipitation and surface currents.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} mixed Rossby-gravity waves (MRGWs) and convection in a general circulation model. The experiments described are performed in a general circulation model with the lower boundary set to that of an ocean surface everywhere. Several experiments are run varying the convective parameterization scheme (using either a modified Kuo scheme or a moist convective adjustment scheme) and varying the tropical sea surface temperatures (specified to be zonally symmetric in all cases), thereby changing {{the location of the}} modeled <b>intertropical</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>zones</b> (ITCZs). The appearance of a robust MRGW occurs when the sea surface temperature is such that two ITCZs straddle the equator. The particular sea surface temperature distribution used and the parameterization scheme for convection also affect the structure and strength of the modeled MRGW. The vertical structure of MRGWs is analyzed in the experiment in which this wave mode is the most energetic. We show that MRGWs of several different zonal length scales exist in the troposphere in association with convection; however, it is only the longer length scales which can be discerned in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere...|$|R
40|$|<b>Intertropical</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>zones</b> (ITCZs), monsoons and monsoon onset {{are among}} the most {{prominent}} of atmospheric phenomena. Understanding their origins is fundamental to a full understanding of the atmospheric general circulation and has challenged meteorologists for a very long time. There has been important progress in understanding these phenomena in recent years, and in this seminar, recent developments, to which the speaker has contributed, are reviewed. First, contrary to conventional belief, land-sea thermal contrast is not necessary for monsoons to form. Second, monsoon onset occurs when there is a sudden poleward jump of an ITCZ during its annual cycle of latitudinal movement. A monsoon, then, is an ITCZ after its poleward jump. Third, the SST latitudinal maximum is not the most significant, or even a necessary, factor in the formation of an ITCZ; there are other important, if not more important, factors. These factors are the interaction between convection and surface fluxes, the interaction between convection and radiation, and the earth's rotation. Finally, the recent understanding of how ITCZs form has led to a conceptual explanation for the origin of the double ITCZ bias in GCM simulations...|$|R

5|$|During the season, three hurricanes {{developed}} from five named storms. This was below {{the average of}} 10storms per season, and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939. Four of the five storms {{developed from}} the <b>intertropical</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>zone.</b> The decreased activity is partially due to the westerlies extending further south than usual, {{as well as a}} persistent ridge. In addition, temperatures in the eastern United States were cooler than usual. Activity through September10 was the quietest in 30years.|$|E

40|$|The role of ocean–atmosphere {{coupling}} in the zonal-mean climate response to projected late twenty-first-century Arctic sea ice loss is investigated using Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM 4) at 18 spatial resolution. Parallel experiments with different ocean model configurations (full-depth, slab, and no interactive ocean) allow {{the roles of}} dynamical and thermodynamic ocean feedbacks to be isolated. In the absence of ocean coupling, the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice loss is confined to north of 308 N, consisting of a weakening and equatorward shift of the westerlies accompanied by lower tropospheric warming and enhanced precipitation at high latitudes. With ocean feedbacks, the response expands to cover the whole globe and exhibits {{a high degree of}} equatorial symmetry: the entire troposphere warms, the global hydrological cycle strengthens, and the <b>intertropical</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>zones</b> shift equatorward. Ocean dynamics are fundamental to producing this equatorially symmetric pattern of response to Arctic sea ice loss. Finally, the absence of a poleward shift of the wintertime Northern Hemisphere westerlies in CCSM 4 ’s response to greenhouse gas radiative forcing is shown to result from the competing effects of Arctic sea ice loss and greenhouse warming on the meridional temperature gradient in middle latitudes. 1...|$|R
40|$|The coupled atmosphere-ocean {{system in}} the {{equatorial}} eastern Pacific and Atlantic exhibits a distinct annual cycle that is reflected in contrasting conditions at the times of the two equinoxes. The contrasts are so strong that they dominate the annual march of zonally averaged outgoing long wave radiation for the equatorial belt. The March equinox corresponds to the warm season when the equatorial cold tongues in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic area absent. With the onset of summer monsoon convection over Colombia, Central America, and West Africa in May-June, northward surface winds strengthen over the eastern Pacific and Atlantic, the equatorial cold tongues reappear, and the marine convection shifts from the equatorial belt to the <b>intertropical</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>zones</b> (ITCZs) along 8 deg N. On the basis of observational evidence concerning the timing and year-to-year regularity of the surface wind changes during {{the development of the}} cold tongues, it is argued that (1) the increase in the northward surface winds in response to the onset of the northern summer monsoon may be instrumental in reestablishing the cold tongues, and (2) positive feedbacks involving both the zonal and meridional wind components contribute to the remarkable robustness of the cold tongue-ITCZs complexes in both oceans...|$|R
40|$|Remote {{infrared}} spectral measurements in the 8 - 13 micron m window region, at {{a resolution}} about 3 cm/ 1, contain useful {{information about the}} water vapor and temperature stratification of the atmosphere within the first few kilometers above the water surface. Two pieces of information are retrieved from the spectral measurements: precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere, from {{the depth of the}} line structure between 8 and 9 micron m due to water vapor lines; and sea surface temperature, from the variation of brightness temperature between 11 and 13 micron m. Together, these two pieces of information can signify either the presence of a deep moist convective layer or the prevalence of stable conditions, such as caused by temperature inversions, which inhibit moist convection. A simple infrared radiative transfer model of the 9 micron m water vapor lines was developed to validate the method. With the help of this model and the Nimbus 4 infrared interferometer spectrometer data, a gross picture of the planetary boundary layer for different seasons over the global oceans is deduced. The important regions of the trade wind inversion and the <b>intertropical</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>zones</b> over all the oceans are clearly identified with this method. The derived information is in reasonable agreement with some observed climatological patterns over the oceans...|$|R
5|$|On July 16, 1970, a large {{disturbance}} {{separated from}} the <b>Intertropical</b> <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone</b> near Panama. The broad area of convection dominated the region between Swan Island and western Cuba by July 18.

40|$|Synoptic-scale {{variability}} of vorticity {{structures in the}} lower troposphere of the tropics is analyzed in 23 yr of daily averaged high-resolution reanalysis data. The vorticity structures {{can be divided into}} zonally elongated vorticity strips, classified as <b>intertropical</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>zones</b> (ITCZs), and more localized maxima, termed westward-propagating disturbances. A composite of such variability is presented for the east to central Pacific and for the east Atlantic/Africa region, both in summer. The composite in the east Pacific is zonally elongated and ITCZ-like, propagating westward over a number of days before dissipating. The spatial structure of the vorticity strip shows the characteristic cyclonic tilt into the latitudinal direction with time that is also seen in modeling experiments. The composite over the Atlantic/Africa region shows two active regions that are correlated on synoptic time scales. The disturbances in the southern region are better developed and longer lasting, even though the time and space scales are smaller than over the east Pacific. Overall, variability over the Atlantic is consistent with variability due to African easterly waves. The double ITCZ in spring in the east Pacific is different from the few earlier studies available. It is stronger south of the equator and located at 10 °S, which is farther poleward than earlier studies have indicated. The northern branch that is weak in comparison is located at 5 °N. The two branches of the double ITCZ tend to appear in tandem on the 2 -week time scale. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} aerosol on clouds poses {{one of the}} largest {{uncertainties}} in estimating the anthropogenic contribution to climate change. Small human-induced perturbations to cloud characteristics via aerosol pathways can create a change in the top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing of hundreds of Wm − 2. Here we focus on links between aerosol and deep convective clouds of the Atlantic and Pacific <b>Intertropical</b> <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zones,</b> noting that the aerosol environment in each region is entirely different. The tops of these vertically developed clouds consisting of mostly ice can reach high levels of the atmosphere, overshooting the lower stratosphere and reaching altitudes greater than 16 km. We show a link between aerosol, clouds and the free atmosphere wind profile that can change the magnitude and sign of the overall climate radiative forcing. We find that increased aerosol loading is associated with taller cloud towers and anvils. The taller clouds reach levels of enhanced wind speeds that act to spread and thin the anvil clouds, increasing areal coverage and decreasing cloud optical depth. The radiative effect of this transition is to create a positive radiative forcing (warming) at top-of-atmosphere. Furthermore we introduce the cloud optical depth (τ), cloud height (Z) forcing space and show that underestimation of radiative forcing is likely to occur in cases of non homogenous clouds. Specifically, the mean radiative forcing of towers and anvils in the same scene can be several times greater than simply calculating the forcing from the mean cloud optical depth in the scene. Limitations of the method are discussed, alternative sources of aerosol loading are tested and meteorological variance is restricted, but the trend of taller clouds, increased and thinner anvils associated with increased aerosol loading remains robust through all the different tests and perturbations...|$|R
40|$|It is a long-held {{fundamental}} {{belief that}} the basic cause of a monsoon is land-sea thermal contrast on the continental scale. Through general circulation model experiments we demonstrate that this belief should be changed. The Asian and Australian summer monsoon circulations are largely intact in an experiment in which Asia, maritime continent, and Australia are replaced by ocean. It is also shown that the change resulting from such replacement is in general due more to the removal of topography than to the removal of land-sea contrast. Therefore, land-sea contrast plays only a minor modifying role in Asian and Australian summer monsoons. This also happens to the Central American summer monsoon. However, the same thing cannot {{be said of the}} African and South American summer monsoons. In Asian and Australian winter monsoons land-sea contrast also plays only a minor role. Our interpretation for the origin of monsoon is that the summer monsoon is the result of ITCZ's (<b>intertropical</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>zones)</b> peak being substantially (more than 10 degrees) away from the equator. The origin of the ITCZ has been previously interpreted by Chao. The circulation around thus located ITCZ, previously interpreted by Chao and Chen through the modified Gill solution and briefly described in this paper, explains the monsoon circulation. The longitudinal location of the ITCZs is determined by the distribution of surface conditions. ITCZ's favor locations of higher SST as in western Pacific and Indian Ocean, or tropical landmass, due to land-sea contrast, as in tropical Africa and South America. Thus, the role of landmass in the origin of monsoon can be replaced by ocean of sufficiently high SST. Furthermore, the ITCZ circulation extends into the tropics in the other hemisphere to give rise to the winter monsoon circulation there. Also through the equivalence of land-sea contrast and higher SST, it is argued that the basic monsoon onset mechanism proposed by Chao is valid for all monsoons...|$|R

5|$|The {{formation}} of Lake Tauca depended on {{a reduction in}} air temperature over the Altiplano {{and an increase in}} precipitation, which may have been caused by shifts in the <b>Intertropical</b> <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone</b> (ITCZ) and increased easterly winds. It was originally supposed that glacial melting might have filled Lake Tauca, but the quantity of water would not have been sufficient to fill the whole lake. The lake was accompanied by glacial advance, noticeable at Cerro Azanaques and Tunupa. Elsewhere in South America, water levels and glaciers also expanded during the Lake Tauca phase.|$|E

40|$|Zonally {{elongated}} {{areas of}} cloudiness {{that make up}} the east Pacific <b>Intertropical</b> 25 <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone</b> (ITCZ) can take on several configurations in instantaneous 26 observations. A novel statistical model is used to automatically assess the daily state of 27 the east Pacific ITCZ using infrared satellite images from 1980 - 2012. Four ITCZ states 28 are defined based on ITCZ location relative to the equator: north (nITCZ) and south 29 (sITCZ) of the equator, simultaneously north and south of the equator (dITCZ, for 30 double), and over the equator (eITCZ). A fifth ITCZ state is used to classify days when 31 no zonally elongated area of cloudiness is present (aITCZ, for absent). The ITCZ states 32 can occur throughout the year (except for the eITCZ, which is not present during June– 33 October), with the nITCZ state dominating in terms of frequency of occurrence. 34 Interannual variability of the state distribution is large. 35 The most striking variability in ITCZ states is observed in spring.

50|$|The {{northern}} part of the state, characterised by Monsoonal circulation, in the winter months from May to September is of generally warm dry offshore winds, drawn across the Inter-Tropical <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone</b> by the low pressure systems of Monsoon Asia. In summer, from November to March, with the displacement of the <b>Intertropical</b> <b>Convergence</b> over northern Australia, the weather is characterised by humid tropical onshore airflows, coupled with thunderstorms and an occasional cyclone, these weather patterns bringing the bulk of the rainfall of the region. The highest wind-gust recorded on the Australian mainland was 259 km/h at Mardi during tropical cyclone Trixie, in 1975 and Whim Creek has the record for the highest rainfall, at 747 mm in 24 hours, associated with a cyclone in 1898.|$|R
40|$|Monsoons and <b>Intertropical</b> <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zones</b> (ITCZ) exhibit {{variability}} {{at various}} {{temporal and spatial}} scales. The temporal scale of variability encompasses scales from the intraseasonal through interannual to interdecadal time scales. Anthropogenic climate change can also {{have an impact on}} ITCZ and monsoons. Thus it is necessary to assess the ability of coupled ocean atmospheric models (commonly known as AOGCM) to simulate these aspects of variability of tropical climate. This has been studied with simulations from 20 AOGCMs and their AGCM from IPCCAR 4 archive. In addition, we have used our own 100 year simulation with CCSM 2 and also simulations with its AGCM viz. CAM 2. Our analysis shows that most model have significant bias in tropical rainfall and SST. Most models underestimate SST except over a few regions such as the Eastern boundaries of Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The AGCMs which are forced with observed SSTs have much higher annual mean rainfall as compared to AOGCMs. There is a strong correlation between error in shortwave reflectance {{at the top of the}} atmosphere and error in SST. The ability of coupled ocean-atmosphere models and their atmosphere-alone counterparts to simulate the seasonal cycle of rainfall over major monsoon regions and also over oceanic ITCZ. It is found that over the Indian monsoon region, most AGCMs overestimate the seasonal cycle while AOGCMs have a more realistic seasonal cycle. This inspite of the fact that most AOGCMs underestimate the SST over the Indian region. It is shown that this is related to errors in precipitable water-rainfall relationship in most models i. e. for a given amount of precipitable water, most models overestimate the rainfall. Thus lower SST reduces the precipitable water and hence the amount of rainfall is reduced. Therefore, the mutual cancellation of errors leads to a more realistic seasonal cycle in AOGCMs. The seasonal cycle over Africa was analysed with the help of a diagnostic model. Over Southern Africa, most models show simulate a less stable atmosphere and hence the rainfall is overestimated. A technique based on Continous Wavelet Transform in Space and Time (CWTST) has been modified to seperate northward and southward propagating modes of BSISO over the Indian and West Pacific regions. It was seen that over the Indian region, northward propagating modes were more prominent in comparison to southward modes. It was also found that the predominant spatial scale (of about 30 o) did not show much interannual variability but the associated temporal scale showed significant variation. Both AOGCMs and AGCMs simulations were analysed to investigate the impact of coupling on intraseasonal activity. Most AOGCMs were able to simulate the predominant spatial scale but were unable to simulate the associated temporal scale correctly. These problems persisted with AGCMs also. It was also found that for AGCMs, there were some variations between ensemble members of the AGCMs. Comparing BSISO in increased GHG scenarios with present day simulations we found that in general, power in the spectrum increases. This could be related to higher mean precipitation that has been simulated by most AOGCMs when GHG are increased. The interannual variability in the tropics with special reference to Tropical Biennial Oscillation (TBO) and ENSO has been studied. The changes in these modes of variability due to anthropogenic climate change has also been assessed. We found that in most models over the Nino 3. 4 region, the mode of variation shifts from a near-four period (in pre-industrial simulations) to that of TBO mode in increased GHG (green house gas) scenario. This suggests that with increasing GHGs, ENSO quasi-periodicity might shift to about two years. It is also interesting to note that for observed rainfall, OLR and 850 hPa winds, the TBO mode has higher variance over the Eastern Indian Ocean, indicating that the TBO mode might be related to Indian Ocean Dipole Mode and EQUINOO (Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation) ...|$|R
