5000|$|Parasite {{made his}} {{animated}} {{debut in the}} 1990s television series Superman: The Animated Series, voiced by Brion James. The origin for Parasite is fairly consistent with his modern one in the comics. This version is able to duplicate the voices of whomever he drains as well. First appearing in the episode [...] "Feeding Time", Rudy Jones is portrayed as a janitor at S.T.A.R. Labs. He and fence Martin Lebeau (voiced by Robert Patrick) stole barrels containing chemicals with unknown properties. But although the two manage to make their getaway in a pickup truck after narrowly escaping the scene, Rudy rides {{in the back of}} the vehicle with the semi-closed barrels. The barrels soon open when the truck encounters an uneven road, spilling their contents all over Rudy and transforming him into the Parasite. Parasite then uses his new powers to go after Lebeau for revenge, almost killing him if not for the timely intervention of Superman. In the ensuring battle, Parasite is able to drain a substantial amount of energy, greatly weakening Superman. With the Man of Steel's powers, Parasite goes on a citywide rampage, and later attacks him in his apartment after discovering his secret identity of Clark Kent. Parasite then trapped him inside a boiler room at S.T.A.R. Labs as a [...] "daily recharge" [...] for his crime sprees. While Parasite is away, Jimmy Olsen stumbles across Superman while investigating, and frees him just as the Parasite returns. Superman, having regained some of his strength, slips into his titanium-lead alloy Kryptonite armor and engages the Parasite in a ferocious battle, which ends when Superman forces Parasite to grab a piece of Kryptonite, which drains him of all his Kryptonian powers to the point of unconsciousness and amnesia. Parasite is subsequently incarcerated in a S.T.A.R. Labs holding cell. In the episode [...] "Two's a Crowd", Superman asks for Parasite's help to learn the location of an atomic bomb that has been hidden by rogue ex-S.T.A.R. Labs scientist Earl Garver (voiced by Brian Cox), to which Parasite agrees, in exchange for Cable TV in his cell. But somehow, Garver's mind takes over Parasite's body in the absorption process. Superman is later forced to fight Garver/Parasite at the location of the bomb, while Rudy and Garver fight inside for control of Parasite's body. Superman eventually manages to defeat the Parasite and destroy the bomb, and Rudy regains control of his body. With Earl Garver recovered and incarcerated, Parasite gets his end of the bargain as he is seen watching TV in his cell. In the episode [...] "Double Dose", Livewire breaks Parasite out of prison, and forms an uneasy alliance with him to destroy Superman. However, Parasite's greed gets the better of him, as he constantly attempts to take Livewire's powers for himself. The two later encounter Superman, protected against both Parasite and Livewire by a layer of latex. However, Livewire shatters it with liquid nitrogen, and Parasite drains Superman of his powers. But Parasite betrays Livewire by absorbing her powers as well, intending to keep both of them trapped and alive as his [...] "unlimited power source". With both the Man of Steel and Livewire's powers, Parasite confronts a weakened Superman alone. But he is eventually defeated when Superman tricks him into burning a mop and setting off an <b>emergency</b> <b>shower</b> which, reacting with Livewire's vulnerability to water, drains Parasite of all his new powers and memories (including Superman's secret identity) to the point that he no longer remembers who he himself is. Parasite is then arrested and returned to prison.|$|E

40|$|S 2 Engineering is {{a senior}} design team in the Department of Physics and Engineering {{designing}} an emergency facility for hazardous material exposure. The objective of this project is to design and build an ANSI Z 358. 1 certified onsite safety shower to handle emergency personnel exposure of toxic propellants. This project has been specifically sponsored by Advanced Mobile Propulsion Test (AMPT), a local aerospace company. This project grants the team the opportunity to demonstrate mastery of {{the wide range of}} skills attained while completing the undergraduate program at FLC. These skills include {{but are not limited to}} fluid mechanics, heat transfer, thermodynamics, pumping technology, hazardous chemicals, general construction, electrical and flow meter analysis. Developments from this project can be used by future students as a platform from which they can gain experience in fluid analysis, thermal processes, Hazmat safety requirements, and networking with industry personnel. The end result of the project is to demonstrate ANSI certification of both shower and eyewash with flow rates of 20 GPM and 0. 4 GPM, respectively. The purpose of the project was to design and build an <b>emergency</b> <b>shower</b> that will be used by AMPT when traveling to testing sites.

40|$|Emergency {{planning}} and preparedness are sometime {{omitted from the}} management of a dyeing factory. Since different processes are operating in a dyeing factory involving use of large machinery, use of hot steam and large amount of chemicals, etc. Failure in the operation may lead to explosion of machinery and spillage of toxic chemical, etc. Therefore, the emergency {{planning and}} preparedness are vital to the dyeing factory because when an emergency does occur, a quick and correct response is necessary to reduce injuries, illness, property damage, environment harm and public concern. Management should identify the types of emergencies the dyeing factory needs to plan, organise, practise and prepare for. A good emergency planning and preparedness could introduce the following:• Fewer claims, resulting in lower insurance premiums;• Less absenteeism and sickness;• Fewer injury and damage accidents;• Better levels of health (both occupational and general);• Higher productivity and efficiency;• Better utilisation of plant and equipment because of less down time;• Higher levels of quality and product safety;• Better legislative compliance;• Higher employee morale and motivation;• Better cost control and reduction; and• Better enterprise image. It could be seen that emergency planning and preparedness means considerably more than providing a first-aid kit, stretcher, <b>emergency</b> <b>shower</b> and eye-wash fountain, or fire blanket. Instead, {{there should be a}} written plan of action for every facility detailing the actions to be taken when an emergency occurs. This ensures appropriate responses when facing extraordinary circumstances. The effectiveness of any of these plans usually is proportionate to the thoroughness and soundness of the planning effort. This paper will introduce the methods of emergency planning and preparedness to be implement in a dyeing factory. Institute of Textiles and ClothingRefereed conference pape...|$|E

40|$|Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative {{bacterium}} responsible for Legionnaire 2 ̆ 7 s disease, and is commonly transmitted via aerosolized water.

40|$|BACKGROUND Acanthamoeba is {{the genus}} of {{free-living}} amoebae {{that is most}} frequently isolated in nature. To date, 20 Acanthamoeba genotypes have been described. Genotype T 4 is responsible for approximately 90 % of encephalitis and keratitis cases. Due to the ubiquitous presence of amoebae, isolation from environmental sources is not uncommon; to determine the clinical importance of an isolation, {{it is necessary to}} have evidence of the pathogenic potential of amoebae. OBJECTIVE The aim {{of this study was to}} physiologically characterise 8 Acanthamoeba T 4 isolates obtained from dental units and <b>emergency</b> combination <b>showers</b> and to determine their pathogenic potential by employing different laboratory techniques. METHODS Eight axenic cultures of Acanthamoeba genotype T 4 were used in pathogenic potential assays. Osmotolerance, thermotolerance, determination and characterisation of extracellular proteases and evaluation of cytopathic effects in MDCK cells were performed. FINDINGS All of the isolates were osmotolerant, thermotolerant and had serine proteases from 44 - 122 kDa. Two isolates had cytopathic effects on the MDCK cell monolayer. MAIN CONCLUSION The presence of Acanthamoeba T 4 with pathogenic potential in areas such as those tested in this study reaffirms the need for adequate cleaning and maintenance protocols to reduce the possibility of infection with free-living amoebae...|$|R
