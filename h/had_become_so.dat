5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with {{destruction}} of property and cruelty to animals and people. Around 1912, the BSA, Boys Clubs and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction that <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> common on this night.|$|E
5|$|The Elements of Botany (1836), an {{introductory}} textbook, {{was the first}} of Gray's many works. In this book Gray espoused the idea that botany was useful not only to medicine, but also to farmers. Gray and Torrey published the Flora of North America together in 1838. By the mid-1850s the demands of teaching, research, gardening, collecting, and corresponding <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> great, and he <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> influential, that Gray wrote two high school-level texts in the late 1850s: First Lessons in Botany and Vegetable Physiology (1857) and How Plants Grow: A Simple Introduction to Structural Botany (1858). The publishers pressured Gray to make these two books non-technical enough so that high school students and non-scientists could understand them. As with most scientists in American academic institutions, Gray found it difficult to concentrate purely on research.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{prosperity}} and modernization PedroII {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. Many of his reforms and achievements <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> {{much a part of the}} national consciousness that they were accommodated by successor regimes. These formed the foundation for Brazilian democratic ideals. Historians have also largely agreed that PedroII's reign was not merely benign, but rather, exceptionally constructive and progressive. He has also consistently been ranked by scholars as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1877, PedroII paid a {{visit to}} Caxias and ascertained that he could no longer remain in office. The entire cabinet {{resigned}} on 1 January 1878. His health problems <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> troubling that he had been asking repeatedly to resign since early 1876. Caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health, but increasingly felt a sense of alienation. He did not feel he could play a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an older generation who perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as essential for holding the nation together.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Jones was {{the front-runner}} for the {{governorship}} {{for the entire}} gubernatorial campaign. The rivalry between Jones and Wilkinson <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> strong that Wilkinson's wife Martha was among Jones' challengers in the Democratic primary; she ended her candidacy 18days before the primary. Advocating campaign finance reform, Jones garnered 184,703 votes in the primary, enough to best a field including Scotty Baesler (149,352 votes), Dr. Floyd Poore (132,060 votes), and Gatewood Galbraith (25,834).|$|E

5|$|Joseph M. Pettit became {{president}} of the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1972. During his 14-year tenure as president, Pettit was credited with turning Georgia Tech into a top-flight research institution. Pettit has also received credit for shifting Georgia Tech back to its roots with regards to providing assistance with economic development within the state of Georgia. In the decades known for the Vietnam War and the launch of Sputnik, research at Georgia Tech and the Georgia Tech Research Institute <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> tied with NASA and the Department of Defense that local industrial development had been largely forgotten.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April, {{given the}} {{deterioration}} in the defences around Phnom Penh, Ambassador John Gunther Dean requested the deployment of the 10-man Operation Eagle Pull command element which landed at Pochentong on a BirdAir C-130 plane. The command element supervised the ongoing fixed-wing evacuation of more than 750 Cambodians {{over the next seven}} days in the face of 80–90 rounds of 105mm artillery and 107mm rocket fire each day. By 10 April Khmer Rouge fire <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> heavy that the fixed-wing evacuation was ended.|$|E
5|$|The Depression of the 1930s exposed glaring {{weaknesses}} in federal-provincial financial arrangements. Canada's poorer provinces {{found it impossible}} to cope with widespread poverty and hunger while the federal government resisted taking full responsibility for unemployment relief. By 1937, conditions <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> desperate that the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan faced bankruptcy. Finally, in August 1937, Prime Minister King appointed the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, popularly known as the Rowell-Sirois Commission. According to biographer Stephen Henderson, Macdonald {{played an important role in}} shaping the Commission's final recommendations.|$|E

5|$|Although a peace {{agreement}} was made in October 2000, violence ensued in the city streets in March 2002 when two diplomats from New Zealand and numerous others were murdered. In July 2003, conditions <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> bad in Honiara that the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), consisting of multiple Pacific nations under Australian leadership, was invited into the country by the Solomons Government to restore order. In 2006, riots broke out following the election of Snyder Rini as Prime Minister, destroying a part of Chinatown and making more than 1,000 Chinese residents homeless. The riots devastated the town and tourism {{in the city and}} the islands was severely affected.|$|E
5|$|By 1388, {{the devastation}} of Dalmatia by the Bosnian army <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> severe that the {{authorities}} of the cities pleaded with Sigismund to either help them or {{to allow them to}} save themselves by submitting without being labeled as traitors. Neither Sigismund's army nor an alliance of Dalmatian cities and noblemen were able to counter Tvrtko's advances. Split, Zadar, and Šibenik having lost all hope, Tvrtko called upon them to negotiate their surrender in March 1389. Each of the cities asked to be the last one to submit and even to be allowed to request Sigismund's assistance once more. Tvrtko granted their wish and decided that Split should be the last to submit, by 15 June 1389.|$|E
5|$|Houston pioneered American car {{culture in}} the early 1900s thanks to the ready {{availability}} of inexpensive gasoline. By the 1920s traffic congestion <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> serious that the city became {{the first in the}} nation to install interconnected traffic lights. Visitors to the city were often astonished at the lack of pedestrian access to shopping venues and the importance of the automobile within the city. Though mass transit had been successful in Houston's earlier years, later efforts aimed at promoting mass transit and urban planning were largely defeated in Houston because of opposition by the public, which favored public investment in roads over mass transit. Urban concepts pioneered in Houston, like establishing shopping centers outside the city's core and encouraging suburban sprawl, became major trends adopted in many cities, both within the state and around the country.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the Reno Gang and other criminals, several white cap groups began operating in the state, primarily in the southern counties. They began carrying out lynchings against suspected criminals, leading the state to attempt {{to crack down on}} their practices. By the turn of the 20th century, they <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> notorious that anti-lynching laws were passed and in one incident the governor called out the militia to protect a prisoner. When the white caps showed up to lynch him, the militia opened fire, killing one and wounding eleven. Vigilante activity decreased following the incident, and remained low until the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Later botanists, such as Philip Miller in 1754, divided cacti {{into several}} genera, which, in 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu placed in his newly created family Cactaceae. By the early 20th century, botanists came to feel Linnaeus's name Cactus <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> {{confused}} {{as to its}} meaning (was it the genus or the family?) {{that it should not}} be used as a genus name. The 1905 Vienna botanical congress rejected the name Cactus and instead declared Mammillaria was the type genus of the family Cactaceae. It did, however, conserve the name Cactaceae, leading to the unusual situation in which the family Cactaceae no longer contains the genus after which it was named.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1942, Graf Zeppelin was towed back to Kiel {{and placed}} in a {{floating}} drydock. It seemed she might well see completion after all, but by late January 1943 Hitler <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> disenchanted with the Kriegsmarine, especially with what he perceived as the poor performance of its surface fleet, that he ordered all of its larger ships taken out of service and scrapped. Raeder was shortly relieved of command and replaced with the Commander of Submarines Karl Dönitz. Though Admiral Dönitz eventually persuaded Hitler to void most of the order, work on all new surface ships and even those nearing completion was halted, including Graf Zeppelin. On 30 January 1943, all major work on the ship ceased, though some limited, temporary work continued until March.|$|E

5|$|What {{were the}} factors {{leading to the}} first {{escapement}} clock in China? The chief tradition leading to Yi Xing (AD 725) was of course the succession of 'pre-clocks' which had started with Zhang Heng about 125. Reason has been given for believing that these applied power to the slow turning movement of computational armillary spheres and celestial globes {{by means of a}} water-wheel using clepsydra drip, which intermittently exerted the force of a lug to act on the teeth of a wheel on a polar-axis shaft. Zhang Heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial armillary sphere, and combining it with the principles of the water-mills and hydraulic trip-hammers which <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> widespread in Chinese culture in the previous century.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of the Balkan Wars, Prince Andrew was {{reinstated}} in the army and Princess Andrew acted as a nurse, assisting at operations and setting up field hospitals, work for which King George V awarded her the Royal Red Cross in 1913. During World War I, her brother-in-law, King Constantine of Greece, followed a neutrality policy despite the democratically elected government of Venizelos supporting the Allies. Princess Andrew and her children were forced to shelter in the palace cellars during the French bombardment of Athens on 1 December 1916. By June 1917, the King's neutrality policy <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> untenable that she {{and other members of the}} Greek royal family were forced into exile when her brother-in-law abdicated. For the next few years, most of the Greek royal family lived in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|After Edgehill, Rupert asked Charles for a swift cavalry {{attack on}} London before the Earl of Essex's army could return. The King's senior counsellors, however, {{urged him to}} advance slowly on the capital with the whole army. By the time they arrived, the city had {{organised}} defences against them. Some argue that, in delaying, the Royalists had perhaps lost their best chance of winning the war, although others have argued that Rupert's proposed attack would have had trouble penetrating a hostile London. Instead, early in 1643, Rupert began to clear the South-West, taking Cirencester in February before moving further against Bristol, a key port. Rupert took Bristol in July with his brother Maurice using Cornish forces and was appointed Governor of the city. By mid-1643 Rupert <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> well known {{that he was an}} issue in any potential peace accommodation—Parliament was seeking to see him punished as part of any negotiated solution, and the presence of Rupert at the court, close to the King during the negotiations, was perceived as a bellicose statement in itself.|$|E
