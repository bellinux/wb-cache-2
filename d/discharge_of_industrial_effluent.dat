Chromium is one of such pollutants which is considered as toxic, non-biodegradable and persistent in nature. In the present study, the fungal strains isolated from the water samples of Manjakkudi lake were screened for their resistance towards the heavy metal, chromium. The Trichoderma sp. BSCR 02 showing resistance towards increased chromium concentration (4  mg/mL) was selected for the biosorption studies. The chromium biosorption ability of the untreated and alkali-treated mycelium of Trichoderma sp. BSCR 02 was compared and found the alkali treatment as better biosorbent. The process parameters governing chromium biosorption by the dead biomass of Trichoderma sp. were optimized and maximum chromium removal was observed at pH 5 with 200  mg/L initial metal concentration at 35 °C when supplemented 1. 6  mg/mL of biosorbent for the contact time of 120  min. The biosorbent {{was found to be}} active for five cycles of biosorption. The results revealed the applicability of the Trichoderma sp.

The pollution in this reservoir {{is considered one of the}} major environmental problems of the city of Belo Horizonte. This paper evaluated the effect of land use and occupation in Banguelo Creek on its water quality, considering the seasonal cycle in several points of the micro-basin. The analyzed parameters for monitoring the water quality were: pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, phosphate, nitrate, total nitrogen, temperature, BOD 5, COD and thermotolerant coliforms. The results were analyzed based on a floristic survey and on land occupation conditions in the micro-basin. Water quality index (WQINSF) was calculated and the points with the highest degree of pollution were identified. Analysis of WQI indicated that the water quality fell in the classes “average” and “bad” during dry season, with improvement for “good” and “average” in the rainy season. The deterioration of water quality was attributed to the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> and sewage that caused low levels of dissolved oxygen, high concentration of organic matter and nutrients. In areas with vegetation, a decrease in the concentrations of pollutants (mainly nitrate and phosphate) was observed, indicating the importance of maintaining riparian vegetation to improve the water quality in the region. The decrease in the pollution level of this creek could improve the water quality in the region, contributing to the eutrophication reduction of Pampulha reservoir...|$|E

40|$|Implementation of a {{screening}} method for mercury {{in the marine}} environment for the identification of contaminated sediment followed by classification of mobility {{has been carried out}} in the Bay of Elefsis, one of the most industrialized areas in the Attica Region of Greece. With releases of mercury being both natural and anthropogenic, and sediment contamination resulting from surface water run off, <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent,</b> atmospheric deposition and from the aquatic environment itself, the extent of sediment mercury pollution is difficult to assess. Screening involving sample digestion, reduction of inorganic mercury to elemental mercury, and the trapping of elemental mercury on detecting papers with a copper iodide coating, to produce a colour the intensity of which is related to the mercury concentration in the sample has been implemented previously in soil and fresh water sediment [1]. This method was implemented in the marine environment. Marine sediment samples were obtained from the Gulf of Elefsis, both coastal and from the centre of the bay. Industrial discharges in the bay arise mainly from shipyards, steelworks and oil refineries. Coastal sampling points were selected in the region of two shipyards, two in the region of refineries, one from a ship disassembly unit, and one sampling point from an outlet that receives effluent from several industries such as asphalt and paper production. Three samples were also collected from the centre of the bay. Previous determinations of metal concentrations have indicated higher results for coastal regions, consistent with pollution directly as a result of main land industrial activity. Screening results indicate that total mercury concentrations in the majority of the samples exceed 0. 1 mg/kg, the method detection limit. There is no agreed international limit value for mercury in sediment. However, subsequent quantification of the mercury concentration in the samples indicated that some exceed the Canadian sediment quality guideline value of 0. 13 mg/kg for marine sediment. Determination of the mobility of mercury in the samples was carried out using sequential extraction, identifying mobile, semi mobile and non mobile species concentrations. The mobile fraction was further separated into organic and inorganic forms of mercury using solid phase extraction with sulphydryl cotton fibres [2]...|$|E

Several studies of metal contamination in aquatic environments {{have been made}} in recent years focusing on the use of biological indicators. The importance of trace metals varies according to their need for human life. The oxidation state (III) for chromium is beneficial in small quantities, participating in the metabolism of the human body, but in the oxidation state (VI) has carcinogenic. Lead is of great environmental interest, because it is present in considerable urban concentrations. The sources of contamination of these metals in aquatic environments can come from industrial waste such as: plating, printing, tannery and pigments. The study to evaluate the environmental pollution can be accomplished through biological indicators such as fish and plants, because the same suffer bioaccumulation and biomagnification of metals. The studied enviment in this work, stream of Guarapuava city PR, receives unhandled sewage load of tanning to more than thirty years. In previous studies conducted by the Group of Trace Analysis and Instrumentation (GATI) were determined high levels of chromium in the particulate for the same environment. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the level of pollution present in that stream through the quantification of Cr and Pb in plants and fish. The work consisted in the optimization of the analytical methodology used in the sample preparing and quantification technique. Fish and plants were prepared by wet acid digestion. The technique used for the quantification of metals was the anodic and cathodic stripping voltammetry with differential pulse polarography. Biological indicators collected from sources free of contamination were also evaluated to obtain a pattern of local background. The comparison of the values obtained with samples of the studied and pattern background was important to confirm the pollution in the stream due to the excessive <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent.</b> These discharges represent a risk to the balance of aquatic communities...|$|E

About 35  % of the groundwater samples were not permissible for drinking based on the electrical conductivity (EC). The EC of groundwater was increasing towards the coast. In general, the quality of groundwater for irrigation purpose vary from moderate to good based on Na%, magnesium hazard, residual sodium carbonate, sodium absorption ratio, permeability index, and USDA classification. Na–Cl and Ca–Mg–Cl were the dominant groundwater and surface water type. Increased ionic concentration of groundwater towards {{the eastern part of the}} study area is due to the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents</b> and domestic sewage into the Adyar River. Seawater intrusion is also one of the reasons for Na–Cl dominant groundwater near the coast. Evaporation and ion exchange were the major processes controlling groundwater chemistry in this area. The groundwater quality of this region is affected by the contaminated surface water.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{azo dyes}} by {{different}} industries can cause direct and/or indirect effects oil human {{and environmental health}} due to the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents</b> that contain these toxic compounds. Several studies have demonstrated the genotoxic effects of various azo dyes, but information on the DNA damage caused by Disperse Red 1 and Disperse Orange 1 is unavailable, although these dyes are used in dyeing processes in many countries. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the mutagenic activity of Disperse Red 1 and Disperse Orange 1 using the micronucleus (MN) assay in human lymphocytes and in HepG 2 cells. In the lymphocyte assay. it was found that the number of MN induced by the lowest concentration of each dye (0. 2 mu g/mL) was similar to that of the negative control. At the other concentrations, a dose response MN formation was observed up to 1. 0 mu g/mL. At higher dose levels, the number of MN decreased. For the HepG 2 cells the results were similar. With both dyes a dose dependent increase in the frequency of MN was detected. However for the HepG 2, the threshold for this increase was 2. 0 mu g/mL, while at higher doses a reduction in the MN number was observed. The proliferation index was also calculated in order to evaluate acute toxicity during the test. No differences were detected between the different concentrations tested and the negative control.

40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 485 - 497 The Aratu Bay {{ecosystem}} (12 ° 48 ′S; 38 ° 28 ′W), {{located in}} an industrialized area, was compared with a similar but undisturbed ecosystem, Iguape Bay, {{in order to determine}} the impact of industry on water quality during the last forty years. Comparison was based on simple and low cost methodologies using bioassays on oyster embryos, validated by a survey of a benthic activity index. A bioassay method based on oyster embryo development was used to compare water quality from the study areas. A high percentage (93. 2 and 97. 3) of abnormal oyster embryo development was observed in water samples from one area (south and southeast) of the bay where, besides receiving heavy <b>discharges</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents,</b> water circulation is restricted. At the north end of the bay where the area is shallow, and some industrial discharges are present, water quality data indicated that the area was stressed. Little effect <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> impact has been noted around the Cotegipe channel, a deep area where the water circulation pattern is heavy and the water well mixed. Validation of this survey has been achieved by the simple method of investigating benthic activity in the area. Quadrat counts of active benthic galleries were used as an index of community activity for comparative analysis between sampling stations and for discriminating between polluted and unpolluted sites. This research has shown that the quadrat counts of active benthic galleries, at least in areas of comparable homogeneous substrate, can be used as a viable index of environmental impact, when interpreted together with other source of data, such as early-life-stage tests. This new approach proved to be effective and led to the recommendation of remedial policies in the area...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Reproductive {{success is}} {{a key factor in}} {{determining}} species survival and the unregulated <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents</b> into rivers and streams in a developing country like Nigeria, can impair reproductive ability in non-target organisms like fish. Fish, generally accumulate contaminants from their environment in their tissues and these can be transmitted through the yolk lipids to the eggs. Approach: Prespawning Clarias gariepinus female brooders were exposed to composite effluent mixtures from a food and beverage industry (discharged into Ona river) for a period of thirty days to determine its effect on growth and fertility/reproductive success (viability of eggs and survival of the F 1 generation fries). Physico-chemical parameters of effluent samples and exposure concentrations were analyzed and effluent sample was further analyzed for heavy metals (Fe, Pb, Cd, Ni, Zn, Cu, Mn). Results: Exposure to the effluents caused decreased weight (- 7. 33 %) and egg production (198 eggs) in the highest exposure concentration. Significant decreases (p 1 generation fries (68. 68, 46. 42 and 22. 33 %) with increasing effluent concentration was also observed in the order 0. 00 %> 4. 40 %> 6. 60 % and there were no viable eggs and fingerlings in the highest exposure concentration(13. 20 %). Effluent sample and exposure concentrations had acidic pH and low DO values while effluent sample contained Fe and Pb in concentrations above the specified standard by the National Environment Standards and Regulation Agency (NESREA) for food and beverage industry effluent discharged into surface waters. Conclusion: The toxic nature of these effluents on the reproductive success of C. gariepinus (a commercially important freshwater fish in Nigeria) is of great concern to sustainable fisheries if stringent measures to monitor effluent quality discharge into this river are not implemented...|$|R
