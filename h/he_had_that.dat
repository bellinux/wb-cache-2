5|$|On Christmas Eve, with Homer's help, the two steal all the Funzo toys from {{underneath}} every Christmas tree in Springfield {{with the intention}} of burning them in the town's long-running tire fire. However, Gary Coleman, who is a security guard at Kid First Industries, comes to stop them. The two parties argue all night until the next morning when they settle down into civilized discussion about the commercialization of Christmas. Coleman changes his opinion about the toy company and helps the Simpsons destroy the remaining functioning Funzo toys that were not destroyed in the tire fire. Afterwards, Homer invites Coleman to Christmas dinner at the Simpson family's house, where Mr. Burns shows up after deciding to donate money to Springfield Elementary following an epiphany <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> night.|$|E
25|$|He wasn't a gregarious bloke, really. He was {{actually}} quite retiring, {{but he was}} always up for a bit of fun. He never seemed to take his cricket all that seriously, in that country way. Numbers didn't mean much to him. In a lot of respects <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> 'Hookesy' outlook. Why would you get eight not out in 10 overs? He couldn't understand, what's the use of that? His record suggests unfulfilled talent and I guess that's what it was to a certain extent.|$|E

During this time, he learned that Zehe was being {{threatened}} with being brought to trial under espionage charges that carried the threat of many decades in prison while being cajoled to turn over to the CIA whatever information <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> might be helpful to that agency. Greenwald conveyed messages to Zehe from his family urging him {{to do whatever it}} took to allow himself to be released as soon as possible. Eventually, Zehe pleaded guilty and conducted a full debriefing in exchange for the promise of a light sentence. He was released as part an exchange of agents in June 1985.|$|E

25|$|In {{a typical}} example, the {{breeding}} box has concrete sides, soil with earthworms (to cleanse the soil) on the bottom, vegetation, curved tiles to provide shelter, feeders, and a chicken waterer. Mosquito netting or screening covers the top. These breeding boxes may be outside, or better {{results may be}} obtained when the boxes are inside a greenhouse—as long as the greenhouse does not get too hot or too dry. One researcher reported that in outdoor boxes, each breeder snail had about seven young. In greenhouses, each breeder snail had about 9 to 12 young. The researcher felt that under better weather conditions than those <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> year, each adult breeder snail would have produced 15 young snails.|$|E
25|$|Matisse {{was visiting}} Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 {{but managed to}} make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and {{remained}} in Nice, in Vichy France. “It seemed to me as if I would be deserting,” he wrote Pierre in September 1940. “If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?” Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> option.|$|E
25|$|On 10 June 2002, Fulton, who {{was being}} held on remand in HMP Maghaberry since December 2001, {{was found dead in}} his prison cell with a leather belt around his neck. Fulton was found on his bed rather than hanging from the ceiling, leading to {{speculation}} that he has death had been accidentally caused by autoerotic asphyxiation. Friends claimed he had expressed suicidal thoughts due to both his failure to recover from his close friend Wright's death, as well as fears <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> he was suffering from stomach cancer. Some reports suggested his unstable mental state had seen him stood down as leader several weeks before his death, with the LVF's power base transferred to Belfast. He was also afraid that rival loyalist inmates wished to kill him inside the prison.|$|E

25|$|Rav Judah {{reported}} in Samuel's name {{an account of}} the rarity of completely Red Cows: When they asked Rabbi Eliezer how far the honor due parents extended, Rabbi Eliezer told of a non-Jew from Ashkelon named Dama son of Nethinah. The Sages offered Dama a profit of 600,000 gold denarii (or Rav Kahana said 800,000 denarii) in exchange for jewels that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> the Sages could use in the ephod, but as the key to the jewels lay under Dama's father's pillow, Dama declined the offer so as not to trouble his father. The next year, God rewarded Dama by causing a Red Cow to be born in his herd. When the Sages went to buy it, Dama told them that he knew that he could ask for {{all the money in the}} world and they would pay it, but he asked for only the money that he had lost in honoring his father.|$|E

500|$|During his career, Stewart was {{regarded}} as one of the hardest bodycheckers in the National Hockey League.
