5|$|As {{with other}} Bond novels, such as Casino Royale, <b>gambling</b> <b>is</b> a theme, {{with not only}} golf {{as part of the}} novel, but opening with the canasta game as well. Raymond Benson {{identified}} times in the novel when Bond's investigation of Goldfinger was a gamble too and cites Bond tossing a coin to decide on his tactics in relation to his quarry. Once more (as with Live and Let Die and Dr. No) it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem and this can be seen as Fleming's reaction to the lack of US support over the Suez Crisis in 1956 as well as Bond's warning to Goldfinger not to underestimate the English.|$|E

25|$|Insurance is {{a method}} of {{shifting}} risk from one party to another. Insurers use actuarial methods to calculate appropriate premiums, {{which is similar to}} calculating gambling odds. Insurers set their premiums to obtain a long term positive expected return in the same manner that professional gamblers select which bets to make. While insurance is sometimes distinguished from gambling by the requirement of an insurable interest, the equivalent in <b>gambling</b> <b>is</b> simply betting against one's own best interests (e.g., a sports coach betting against his own team to mitigate the financial repercussions of a losing season).|$|E

50|$|The {{issue before}} the Court {{was whether the}} right to control high-stakes <b>gambling</b> <b>was</b> {{protected}} under section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.

The Court of Appeal disagreed with the bands and found that the right to <b>gambling</b> <b>was</b> not protected under section 35(1) because it failed to meet the criteria set forth in the Van der Peet test.|$|R
25|$|While {{gambling}} using virtual items {{falls within}} acceptable practice in US case law, the fluidity between virtual goods and currency, enabled by the Steam Marketplace, makes it unclear if skin <b>gambling</b> <b>is</b> legal under US law and if Valve would be liable.

25|$|Kyōtei, {{a form of}} boat racing, is one of {{the sports}} for which <b>gambling</b> <b>is</b> officially allowed in Japan, {{established}} as a means to help with restoring the nation's shipbuilding industry. It was largely responsible for Japan's meteoric rise {{to become one of the}} world's maritime leaders by the 1960s. The system is regulated by the department of transport, and many of the foundations Sasakawa later created through grants by The Nippon Foundation were led by previous employees of the department of transport. The system of farming out former government employees to businesses and foundations has long been common, legal practice in Japan, though one that Sasakawa himself viewed with suspicion.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} of the Isle of Man enacted licensing conditions in February 2017 allowing online gambling operators to allow players to deposit, gamble with and withdraw virtual items such as skins. This is performed under strict regulation ensuring all <b>gambling</b> <b>is</b> done using certified random number generators (RNGs) and that no minors participate. This was seen as potentially restoring the skin gambling market after the 2016 discovers. In August 2017, the United Kingdom's Gambling Commission opened an investigation into skin gambling. The Commission has previously carried out the successful prosecution of two owners of a UK website which promoted virtual goods gambling around the FIFA games, on charges of advertising unlawful gambling and encouraging underage gambling.|$|E

25|$|Anzac Day is a {{national}} public holiday and {{is considered by many}} Australians {{to be one of the}} most solemn days of the year.

The Anzac Day March from each state capital is televised live with commentary. These events are generally followed by social gatherings of veterans, hosted either in a public house or in an RSL club, often including a traditional Australian gambling game called two-up, which was an extremely popular pastime with ANZAC soldiers. In most Australian states and territories, <b>gambling</b> <b>is</b> forbidden outside of licensed venues. However, due to the significance of this tradition, two-up is legal only on Anzac Day.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the betting scandal, Stern revised the {{guidelines}} on the behavior of NBA referees during the Board of Governors' meeting in 2007. Despite the labor agreement for referees, which restricted them from participating in almost all forms of gambling, it was revealed that about half of the NBA's officials had made bets in casinos, albeit not with sportsbooks. In addition, almost all referees had admitted to engaging in some form of gambling. Stern stated that [...] " [...] ban on <b>gambling</b> <b>is</b> absolute, and in my view it is too absolute, too harsh and was not particularly well-enforced over the years". The gambling rules were revised to allow referees to engage in several forms of betting—though not on sports. There were several other referee-related rule changes made: the announcement of referees of a game was moved from 90 minutes before tip-off to the morning of the game, to reduce the value of the information to gamblers; referees received more in-season training and counseling [...] on gambling; more thorough background checks were carried out; the league declared its intention to analyze the statistical relationship between NBA games and referees' gambling patterns for those games; and the interactions between referees and NBA teams were made easier and more formal.|$|E

500|$|While the {{majority}} of reviewers gave Dota 2 highly positive reviews, a common criticism was that the game maintains a steep learning curve that requires exceptional commitment to overcome. While providing a moderately positive review that praised Valve's product stability, Fredrik Åslund from the Swedish division of Gamereactor described his first match of Dota 2 {{as one of the}} most humiliating and inhospitable experiences of his gaming career, citing the learning curve and players' attitudes as unwelcoming. Benjamin Danneberg of GameStar alluded to the learning curve as a [...] "learning cliff", calling the newcomer's experience to be painful, with the tutorial feature new to the Dota franchise only being partially successful. In a review for the Metro newspaper, Dota 2 was criticized for not compensating for the flaws with the learning curve from Defense of the Ancients, as well as the sometimes hostile community, which is commonly criticized in multiplayer online battle arena games. Peter Bright of Ars Technica also directed criticism at the ability for third-party websites to allow skin gambling and betting on match results, similar to [...] with Valve's [...] Using Dota 2 as an example, Bright thought that Valve had built gambling elements directly into their games, and had issues with the unregulated practice, which he stated was often used by underage players and regions where <b>gambling</b> <b>is</b> illegal. Australian senator Nick Xenophon had similar sentiment, stating that he wanted to introduce legislation in his country to minimize underage access to gambling within video games, including Dota 2. In response to the controversy, Valve and Dota 2 project manager, Erik Johnson, stated that they would be taking action against the third-party sites, saying that the practice was not allowed by their API or their user agreements.|$|E
