25|$|Not once, {{but three}} times, the stumps were plucked by players eager to grab souvenirs of an {{historic}} occasion. First of all, the Australian captain bowled a full toss down the leg side and took <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> Compton would {{hit the ball}} to the boundary rails. He forgot that Compton was out of form and out of luck. Instead of the ball going to the rails, it was missed completely and poor Tallon, with his arms full of stumps and bails, had to drop the lot and take the ball.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the {{procedures}} described in the Mishnah and Tosefta are all plausible procedures for regulating an empirical lunar calendar. Fire-signals, for example, or smoke-signals, are known from the pre-exilic Lachish ostraca. Furthermore, the Mishnah contains laws that reflect the uncertainties of an empirical calendar. Mishnah Sanhedrin, for example, holds that when one witness holds that an event took place on a certain day of the month, and another that the same event {{took place on the}} following day, their testimony can be held to agree, since the length of the preceding month was uncertain. Another Mishnah takes <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> it cannot be known in advance whether a year's lease is for twelve or thirteen months. Hence it is a reasonable conclusion that the Mishnaic calendar was actually used in the Mishnaic period.|$|E

25|$|In Chullin 92a-b Ulla {{says that}} here are 30 laws which {{the sons of}} Noah took upon themselves. However he only lists three, namely the three that the Gentiles follow: not to create a Ketubah between males, not to sell carrion {{in the market and}} to respect the Torah. The rest of the laws are not listed. Talmud {{commentator}} Rashi remarks on this that he does not know the other Commandments that are referred to. Though the authorities seem to take <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> Ulla's thirty commandments included the original seven, an additional thirty laws is also possible from the reading. Two different lists of the 30 laws exist. Both lists include an additional twenty-three mitzvot which are subdivisions or extensions of the seven laws. One from the 16th-century work Asarah Maamarot by Rabbi Menahem Azariah da Fano and a second from the 10th century Samuel ben Hofni which was recently published from his Judeo-Arabic writings after having been found in the Cairo Geniza. Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Chajes suggests Menahem Azariah of Fano enumerated commandments are not related to the first seven, nor based on Scripture, but instead were passed down by oral tradition.|$|E

500|$|The {{journalist}} Jeff Simon described Hoffman as [...] "probably {{the most}} in-demand character actor of his generation", but Hoffman claimed never to take <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> {{he would be}} offered roles. Although he worked hard and regularly, he was humble about his acting success, and when asked by a friend if he was having any luck he quietly replied, [...] "I'm in a film, Cold Mountain, that has just come out." [...] Patrick Fugit, who worked with Hoffman on Almost Famous, recalled the actor was intimidating but an exceptional mentor and influence in [...] "a school-of-hard-knocks way", remarking that [...] "there was a certain weight that came with him". Hoffman admitted that he sometimes appeared in big-budget studio films for the money, but said, [...] "ultimately my main goal is to do good work. If it doesn't pay well, so be it." [...] He kept himself grounded and invigorated as an actor by attempting to appear on stage once a year.|$|E
500|$|In chapter one, [...] "The Nature of Anthropology and Anthropophagy", Arens {{discusses}} {{the study of}} anthropophagy, or cannibalism, within the anthropological discipline. Noting that anthropologists have widely taken <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> there are societies who socially sanction cannibalism, he nevertheless states {{that there is no}} [...] "adequate documentation" [...] for such practices anywhere in the world. In {{the second part of the}} chapter, he explores several first-hand accounts of cannibalism and highlights their implausible and inaccurate nature. Beginning with the German Hans Staden's claims to have encountered socially sanctioned cannibalism among the Tupinambá people of South America in the 1550s, Arens illustrates a number of logical contradictions in Staden's account, and highlights the dubious nature of the text. The anthropologist then moved on to the 19th-century accounts of widespread socially approved cannibalism among the Polynesian people of Rarotonga in the Cook Islands provided by Ta'unga, a Polynesian native who had been converted to Christianity and wrote for the London Missionary Society; Arens again highlights a number of inconsistencies and logical impossibilities in Ta'unga's claims.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} was highlighted for its depth. IGN's Doug Perry called GoldenEye 007 an immersive game which [...] "blends smart strategy gameplay with fast-action gunmanship". Similarly, Greg Sewart of Gaming Age {{remarked that}} players have [...] "a bit of freedom {{as to what}} they want to do in any given situation, and what order the directives are completed in". Reviewers also enjoyed the wide variety of weapons and the multi-objective-based missions, stating that they make the game stay [...] "fresh by never having you do the same thing twice". The controls were praised for being more intuitive than Acclaim's earlier well-received Nintendo 64 first-person shooter [...] Game Revolution credited the gameplay for being realistic and different from other shooters, but also criticised the campaign for being badly paced. The publication noted that GoldenEye 007 [...] "takes <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> you have already seen the movie" [...] and that players may get stuck due to the game's lack of orientation. At the time, the multiplayer mode was considered the best multiplayer game on the system, [...] "edging Mario Kart 64 by a hair" [...] according to IGN. Edge called it addictive and praised the originality of some of the scenarios such as You Only Live Twice.|$|E

500|$|During Offenbach's lifetime, {{and in the}} {{obituary}} notices in 1880, fastidious critics (dubbed [...] "Musical Snobs Ltd" [...] by Gammond) showed themselves at odds with public appreciation. In a 1980 article in The Musical Times, George Hauger commented that those critics not only underrated Offenbach, but wrongly supposed that his music would soon be forgotten. Although most critics of the time made that erroneous assumption, a few perceived Offenbach's unusual quality; in The Times, Francis Hueffer wrote, [...] "none of his numerous Parisian imitators has {{ever been able to}} rival Offenbach at his best." [...] Nevertheless, the paper joined in the general prediction: [...] "It is very doubtful whether any of his works will survive." [...] The New York Times shared this view: [...] "That he had the gift of melody in a very extraordinary degree is not to be denied, but he wrote currente calamo, and the lack of development of his choicest inspirations will, it is to be feared, keep them from reaching even the next generation". After the posthumous production of The Tales of Hoffmann, The Times partially reconsidered its judgment, writing, [...] "Les Contes de Hoffmann [...] confirm the opinion of those who regard him as a great composer {{in every sense of the}} word". It then lapsed into what Gammond calls [...] "Victorian sanctimoniousness" [...] by taking <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> the opera [...] "will uphold Offenbach's fame long after his lighter compositions have passed out of memory." ...|$|E

40|$|The Casas-Ibarra {{parametrization}} is {{a description}} of the Dirac neutrino mass matrix M_D in terms of the neutrino mixing matrix V, an orthogonal matrix O and the diagonal mass matrices of light and heavy Majorana neutrinos in the type-I seesaw mechanism.
