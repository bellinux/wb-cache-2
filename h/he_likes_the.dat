This doesn't mean that Cookie rounds out his diet with plates, trucks, ukuleles, and other objects the munching monster {{has been known to}} devour. This means that Cookie now eats a fair share of salads, meats, and vegetables to set a good example for viewers at home. And Cookie doesn't mind a bit. Sure he loves cookies, but <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> act of eating in general. As long as his mouth is full, his heart is happy.|$|E
5|$|In another vision Scully lies on a {{table and}} is visited by her {{deceased}} father. Mulder, sitting with Melissa in the hospital cafeteria, is asked by a woman for change for the cigarette machine. When she says that a pack of Morleys is already there and leaves, Mulder opens it and finds the Cigarette Smoking Man's address inside. Mulder bursts into the Cigarette Smoking Man's home and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know why Scully was taken instead of him. The Cigarette Smoking Man claims <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> both of them, which is why she was returned; he reveals that he told Skinner it was Mulder who shot {{the man in the}} parking lot, although he didn't believe this to be true, incidentally revealing himself as unaware of who did shoot the man, namely X. He tells Mulder that he'll never know the truth if he kills him, and Mulder decides not to.|$|E
5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E

25|$|Badges {{are not a}} final goal, but a first step, to give a Scout encouragement. The Scout {{should then}} decide by himself to proceed if <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> activity, without further need of {{standard}}s. Scouting {{should not be a}} high standard of knowledge. This part of the method is no longer emphasized, as today's standards are higher than in the past, and there are additional levels in the United States above the class badges.|$|E

500|$|Andy chooses Darryl to be consigliere, a {{reference}} to the 1972 crime film The Godfather; one brief scene in the episode in which Darryl accepts the position parallels the final scene of The Godfather. [...] Darryl later notes that <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>The</b> Godfather because he is a [...] "cinephile", but that <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> 1983 film Scarface because he is black. Clark tries to start up a conversation with Erin about Newsweek. Later, while discussing news anchors, Meredith mentions how attractive she found Walter Cronkite. Dwight and Nellie watch 127 Hours, a 2010 biographical survival drama film starring James Franco as real-life canyoneer Aron Ralston, who became trapped by a boulder in an isolated slot canyon in Blue John Canyon, southeastern Utah, in April 2003, and was eventually forced to amputate his own right arm in order to free himself.|$|E

500|$|Zito {{is known}} for his idiosyncrasies and his offbeat personality. Early in his career, Zito dyed his hair blue. He earned the nicknames [...] "Planet Zito" [...] and [...] "Captain Quirk" [...] when with Oakland.

He surfs and {{practices}} yoga. He has done yoga poses in the outfield, and meditated before games. Zito practices Transcendental Meditation and supports the David Lynch Foundation. Zito has said, however, that he believes terms such as [...] "flaky" [...] or [...] "hippie" [...] have been applied to him by people who do not know him well enough to know better.|$|E

500|$|During {{his meeting}} with fellow GE executives, in which Jack {{is not allowed to}} be with them due to his bedbugs condition, a {{telepresence}} system—a television screen in which the executives can be seen—is placed in Jack's office to witness the meeting. One of the executives (Michael Mulheren) asks Jack if <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> Cisco Systems equipment, which he does, calling it [...] "the gold standard by which all business technology is judged. Cisco: The Human Network", then after an argument with the executives, they mute him, prompting Jack to say [...] "Did you just mute me!? Did you just use Cisco's cutting edge SureMute™ technology to mute me!?" [...] Some reviewers wondered whether or not 30 Rock continued doing more product placement with the addition of Cisco Systems, as they {{have done in the past}} with Snapple, Verizon, and SoyJoy.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Springfield {{has been}} {{devastated by the}} crime wave. Mayor Quimby decides to take action by forming a Blue Ribbon Committee. At the Simpsons' house, someone steals Lisa's Malibu Stacy collection. Homer decides to take action by looking for it. He finds the culprit, Jimbo Jones, and later foils a robbery by Snake Jailbird at the Kwik-E-Mart. He goes through a very long list of his {{previous}} jobs (during which Marge puts curlers in her hair offscreen) and decides that <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> idea of combining his love of helping and hurting people. Homer forms his own security company called [...] "SpringShield". Although it only has Homer, Lenny, and Carl, it is more efficient and more successful than the Springfield Police Department. When Quimby sees Chief Wiggum trying to shoot a Piñata with a shotgun while blindfolded, he dismisses Wiggum and (in a fit of rage) makes Homer the chief of police.|$|E
500|$|Elle's first chronological {{appearance}} is in [...] "Four Months Ago...". During this time, the Company made Peter Petrelli their willing prisoner {{and in those}} months he was held, Elle seems to have developed a cute crush on him. Peter confesses that <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> little jolts which Elle gives him as a tease and kisses her. She confides in Peter that she {{has lived in the}} Company's holding facility for 16 years. She also admits to being diagnosed as a sociopath; she explains at age six, she accidentally set her grandmother's house on fire and, at age eight, caused a major blackout in Ohio. She also says that she spent her ninth birthday in a glass room with an IV of lithium in her arm. She also explains that she has never been on a date and has never been swimming. When he escapes from the facility, Elle is upset and angry to the point that she blasts Peter, setting him ablaze during his escape. She then chases after Adam Monroe while the Haitian goes after Peter.|$|E

500|$|In 1576, in a {{move that}} {{endangered}} Henry's throne, Francis allied with the Protestant princes against the crown. On 6 May 1576, Catherine gave in to almost all Huguenot demands in the Edict of Beaulieu. The treaty became known as the Peace of Monsieur because it was thought that Francis had forced it on the crown. Francis died of consumption in June 1584, after a disastrous intervention in the Low Countries during which his army had been massacred. Catherine wrote, the next day: [...] "I am so wretched to live long enough to see so many people die before me, although I realize that God's will must be obeyed, that He owns everything, and that he lends us only for as long as <b>He</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> children whom He gives us." [...] The death of her youngest son was a calamity for Catherine's dynastic dreams. Under Salic law, by which only males could ascend the throne, the Huguenot Henry of Navarre now became heir presumptive to the French crown.|$|E
500|$|As Betty Francis (January Jones) packs for {{a family}} ski vacation, Sally {{complains}} that she would rather spend the weekend with Don and Megan (Jessica Paré). An angry Betty calls Don to say she is dropping Sally off at his apartment. To Megan's surprise, Sally {{shows up at the}} apartment and informs her that she will be staying for the weekend. Megan later complains to Don for not telling her about Sally's visit. Don confides that he had to fire Lane for embezzlement. Lane arrives home drunk to find that Rebecca has surprised him with a new Jaguar. She tells him her reasoning — he never spends on himself. He vomits, but, the next morning, reassures Rebecca (Embeth Davidtz) that <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> car. Lane attempts to commit suicide {{in the middle of the}} night using the new car's exhaust, but, in an ironic confirmation of Cooper's earlier retort of Jaguars that [...] "They don't start!", the car fails to start. He then walks into SCDP's empty office and types a letter at his desk.|$|E
500|$|Much {{like the}} sixth season starter [...] "Gossip"—which {{featured}} parkour {{in the cold}} opening—the seventh season opener [...] "Nepotism"—which started with a lip dub—and the eighth season premiere [...] "The List"—which opened with a bit about planking—"New Guys" [...] also contains a plot involving a popular Internet meme, in this case slacklining, which is a practice in balance that typically uses nylon webbing tensioned between two anchor points. When Ryan is leaving, he claims {{he is going to}} Ohio because [...] "they call it the Silicone Prairie," [...] a reference to Silicon Valley, a part of the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California in the United States that is home to many of the world's largest technology corporations. Andy returns from Outward Bound, an organization that aims to foster the personal growth and social skills of participants by using challenging expeditions in the outdoors. Dwight tries to talk to Clark about the heavy metal band Slayer, noting that he has tickets for a show in ten months. Jim asks Pete if <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia Phillies, but Pete mistakes his reference to mean horses.|$|E

500|$|As Lois is {{informed}} the sex education classes will be terminated, she exclaims [...] "Oh, no!", a cut-a-way scene then begins of {{a sports car}} driving along the road with music playing in the background, this is a reference to Knight Rider. When Stewie is using his toys in order to capture and kill the tooth fairy, the toys are SpongeBob from SpongeBob SquarePants, Starscream (from The Transformers) and Man-E-Faces, {{all of which are}} fictional characters for television programs. When Peter is watching television, he is watching the women shown on the episode are actually cartoon animations of the real actors for the show. [...] When Lois catches Chris and his friends watching a pornographic film, she tells them that without sex education, they can easily become sexually confused. [...] The scene cuts to Michael Jackson in his childhood form eating a bowl of Frosted Mini-Wheats, saying that <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> frosted side, while the grown-up in him likes his younger self. [...] When Lois teaches a sex education class, Peter uses a bust of William Shakespeare and a Rainbow Brite doll to demonstrate sexual intercourse. In the scene where Stewie loses a tooth, everybody comes in and tells him to calm down, then it shows a long line of characters, mimicking a scene from the movie Airplane!. While doing a news story on ear sex, Diane tells Tom that [...] is on Thursdays. When Brian talks about Jillian's bulimia, he mentions the death of singer Karen Carpenter, who died from anorexia in 1983. When Stewie thinks that Brian is the Tooth Fairy, Brian substantiates his identity by telling Stewie he has a picture of Chris Noth in his wallet, known for his role on Law & Order.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson {{continued}} feuding with Tedder in 2010. In December 2009, Tedder {{said that}} he was no longer angry over the accusations Clarkson made, but warned, [...] "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. [...] I don't wanna get some crazy-ass backlash or get my head snapped off for writing a hit song." [...] He later told The Denver Post that he had gotten over the situation and is working on new material for Clarkson's fifth album. Clarkson, however, told the Daily Star that she is writing and recording new songs with new, low-profile producers. [...] "I don’t like working with people who have worked with everyone. Sometimes I get blackmailed into doing so by my label," [...] she said, [...] "but I prefer collaborating with people who aren't on the grid. I don’t want to sound exactly like other people's records." [...] In May, an unreleased electro-pop song by Clarkson called [...] "Wash, Rinse, Repeat" [...] was leaked on the Internet. The song contains auto tuned lyrics that Idolator say are likely written about Tedder: [...] "I can't take the pressure of new. Give me old, rip it off. / Let's see if it sticks to the wall again. / Does it sound familiar? Does it linger in your ear? / Like something you remember from just last year?" [...] and [...] "Music from the past, from the present, well, just last week / We will change a note and get away with it, wait and see." [...] Tedder {{said that he}} thinks the song was written about him, too, but admitted <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> song. [...] "I think Kelly speaks her mind regardless of anything. She's great with lyrics, and I love that she is her own person. She's no puppet." ...|$|E
500|$|No title sponsor was {{announced}} {{for the team}} in 2010, as it went about signing riders for its inaugural season. It was known simply as the [...] "Luxembourg Pro Cycling Project" [...] for the first several months of its existence. Even {{as the end of}} 2010 neared, Nygaard steadfastly refused to reveal the team's official name, opting to hold off on doing so until the team's official presentation on January 6, 2011. Team member Jakob Fuglsang perhaps inadvertently revealed part of the name in an interview about three weeks before the team's presentation, saying the team would be called [...] "Team Leopard" [...] and that Leopard would be the name {{in the center of the}} jersey. Trek, which signed on as a bike supplier in September, was revealed as a title sponsor at the team's presentation, officially making the team's name Leopard Trek. The Leopard name has no particular meaning; it reflects Becca's holding company and is simply an animal <b>he</b> <b>likes.</b> <b>The</b> team presentation itself was something of a spectacle, featuring gymnasts, race videos, and presentations for each rider in front of an audience of 4,000 people, culminating in Nygaard and all riders appearing on stage wearing suit jackets and black scarves as they posed for photos. Shortly after the team's presentation, Trek sent out a primer to cycling media detailing their preferences that the team not be referred to with the prefix [...] "Team" [...] as some other teams are and that there be no hyphen between the sponsors' names. They also specified a preferred verbal pronunciation and that when referred to in print, the team's name should appear in all capital letters. This last request was not widely adhered to.|$|E
