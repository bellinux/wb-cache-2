Vizzy had Amarnath pad up, but didn't put him in to bat as a succession of other batsmen were sent in ahead of him, which prevented Amarnath from resting his injury.

2500|$|Amarnath was {{controversially}} {{sent back}} from the 1936 tour of England by the captain, the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram, for [...] "indiscipline". Amarnath and others allege {{it was due to}} politics. Vizzy, the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram, was named the captain for Indian cricket team for the 1936 tour of England, a post that he secured after lobbying and manipulation. Unfortunately, his desperately poor captaincy on the field resulted in even the normally reserved British press commenting on it. Some of the senior players in the squad, including Lala Amarnath, C. K. Nayudu and Vijay Merchant, were critical of Vizzy's playing abilities and captaincy, and the team was split between those who supported and criticised the captain.

2500|$|Following their post-sleep period, {{the crews}} {{set to work}} {{preparing}} for the first spacewalk of the mission. Stefanyshyn-Piper and Bowen were suited up and in the airlock ahead of schedule, and the EVA started at 18:09 UTC, with Piper becoming the first female Lead Spacewalker. While Piper was preparing to begin work on the SARJ, she noticed {{a significant amount of}} grease in her tool bag, [...] "I think we had a grease gun explode in the large bag, because there's grease in the bag," [...] Piper reported to Kimbrough, who was working inside the shuttle to help coordinate the EVA. Mission Control managers instructed Piper to clean up the grease using a dry wipe, and while she was doing the cleanup, one of the crew lock bags floated away. [...] "I guess one of my crew lock bags was not transferred and it's loose," [...] Piper told Kimbrough. The bag floated aft and starboard of the station, and did not pose a risk to the station or orbiter. After taking an inventory of the items inside the lost bag, managers on the ground determined that Bowen had all those items in <b>his</b> <b>bag,</b> <b>and</b> the two could share equipment. While it extended the EVA duration slightly, the major objectives were not changed, and all EVA tasks were accomplished. The estimated value of the lost tool bag was US$100,000. An amateur astronomer later observed the tool bag as it orbited the Earth prior to re-entering. It {{was not the first time}} that equipment had got away from spacewalkers, items lost in the past include tools, nuts and bolts, glue guns, cameras, cloths, and even a robotic arm. The United States Space Surveillance Network constantly monitors over 12,500 items in orbit around the Earth.|$|E
