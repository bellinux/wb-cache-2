It causes high mortality especially in weak and small sized fish stocked at high density in poorly managed net cage. Study to determine the virulence levels of the bacterial pathogen in various <b>aquaculture</b> <b>animals</b> {{is a key to}} prevent vibriosis in marine aquaculture. Methodology and Result: Isolation of bacteria from diseased Asian seabass was done using tryptic soy agar (TSA) and thiosulphate citrate bile sucrose agar (TCBS) plates. Virulence of two strains of Vibrio harveyi (VHJR 4 and VHJR 7) was tested against clinically healthy <b>aquaculture</b> <b>animals.</b> The analysis revealed that the two bacterial strains differ in pathogenicity. The V. harveyi strain VHJR 7 was virulent to Asian seabass at 1. 40 x 104 c. f. u. g- 1, humpback grouper(Cromileptis altivelis) at LD 50 8. 33 x 103 c. f. u. g- 1 and black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) at LD 50 3. 26 x 104 c. f. u. g- 1,respectively. The V. harveyi strain VHJR 4 was not virulent to Asian seabass and humpback grouper but it caused mortality to black tiger shrimp at LD 50 1. 32 x 106 c. f. u. g- 1. Phenotypically, the two strains shared most of the biochemical features except that the V. harveyi strain VHJR 7 was a urease positive and grew at 8. 5 % NaCl, and at 10 °C. The percentage similarity of nucleotide sequences of 16 S rDNA in V. harveyi VHJR 4 and V. harveyi VHJR 7 was higher (99 %) but reduced at 95 % in hemolysin gene.

Approximately 30 % of sulfadoxine was degraded after Pseudomonas sp. DX 7 was inoculated into mineral salt plus tryptone media containing 10 mg l(- 1) sulfadoxine for 2 days. The degradation efficiency under different environmental conditions was characterized using HPLC. The optimal temperature and pH for sulfadoxine biodegradation were around 30 A degrees C and 6. 0, respectively. The optimal concentrations of sulfadoxine and tryptone for sulfadoxine biodegradation were determined to be approximately 30 mg l(- 1) and between 2. 0 and 8. 0 g l(- 1), respectively. Cytotoxicity analysis indicated that the metabolites of sulfadoxine generated by Pseudomonas sp. DX 7 showed significantly reduced cytotoxicity to Hela cells.

Chinese Academy of Sciences[KZCX 2 -EW- 206]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [20975089]; Doctoral Foundation of Shandong Province[BS 2011 SW 056]; Department of Science and Technology of Yantai City of China[2010235]; Chinese Academy of SciencesGiven that the intensive application of sulfonamides in <b>aquaculture,</b> <b>animal</b> husbandry and malaria treatment has {{lead to an increase}} in sulfonamide discharge into the environment, there is an increasing need to find a way to remediate sulfonamide-contaminated sites. The bacterial strain DX 7 was isolated from a marine environment and is capable of degrading sulfadoxine. DX 7 was identified as a Pseudomonas sp. based on 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Approximately 30 % of sulfadoxine was degraded after Pseudomonas sp. DX 7 was inoculated into mineral salt plus tryptone media containing 10 mg l(- 1) sulfadoxine for 2 days. The degradation efficiency under different environmental conditions was characterized using HPLC. The optimal temperature and pH for sulfadoxine biodegradation were around 30 A degrees C and 6. 0, respectively. The optimal concentrations of sulfadoxine and tryptone for sulfadoxine biodegradation were determined to be approximately 30 mg l(- 1) and between 2. 0 and 8. 0 g l(- 1), respectively. Cytotoxicity analysis indicated that the metabolites of sulfadoxine generated by Pseudomonas sp. DX 7 showed significantly reduced cytotoxicity to Hela cells. These results suggest that Pseudomonas sp. DX 7 is a new bacterial resource for degrading sulfadoxine and indicate the potential of the isolated strain in the bioremediation of sulfadoxine-contaminated environments...|$|R
