50|$|Color {{normalization}} {{has been}} used for object recognition on color images in the field of robotics, bioinformatics and <b>general</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence,</b> when it is important to remove all intensity values from the image while preserving color values. One example is in case of a scene shot by a surveillance camera over the day, where it is important to remove shadows or lighting changes on same color pixels and recognize the people that passed. Another example is automated screening tools used for the detection of diabetic retinopathy as well as molecular diagnosis of cancer states, where it is important to include color information during classification.|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{artificial}} intelligence, or industrial AI, usually {{refers to}} the application of artificial intelligence to industry.

Although in a dystopian vision of AI applications, intelligent machines may take away jobs of humans and cause social and ethical issues, industry in general holds a more positive view of AI and sees this transformation of economy unstoppable and expects huge business opportunities in this process.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{organized}} in the following approach. First, we will {{address some of the}} main issues for <b>general</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> Second, to enhance our understanding of the problems, this article will provide a general overview of two axiological theories presented from philosophy: absolutism and relativism. We will discuss some examples of how these concepts relate to machine learning algorithms. Third, we will argue the thesis statement that classification requires relativism to be useful. The goal {{of this paper is to}} show how relativism can be used as a strategy to help solve some of the issues for <b>general</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> The concept of relativity can be useful for: (1) axiology, (2) defining things, and (3) memory.

40|$|Verification and {{validation}} of agentic behavior {{have been suggested}} as important research priorities in efforts to reduce risks associated {{with the creation of}} <b>general</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (Russell et al 2015). In this paper we question the appropriateness of using language of certainty with respect to efforts to manage that risk. We begin by establishing a very general formalism to characterize agentic behavior and to describe standards of acceptable behavior. We show that determination of whether an agent meets any particular standard is not computable. We discuss the extent of the burden associated with verification by manual proof and by automated behavioral governance. We show that to ensure decidability of the behavioral standard itself, one must further limit the capabilities of the agent. We then demonstrate that if our concerns relate to outcomes in the physical world, attempts at validation are futile. Finally, we show that layered architectures aimed at making these challenges tractable mistakenly equate intentions with actions or outcomes, thereby failing to provide any guarantees. We conclude with a discussion of why language of certainty should be eradicated from the conversation about the safety of <b>general</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 0 figure...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{significant}} lack of unified approaches to building generally intelligent machines. The majority of current artificial intelligence research operates within a very narrow field of focus, frequently without {{considering the importance of}} the 'big picture'. In this document, we seek to describe and unify principles that guide the basis of our development of <b>general</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> These principles revolve around the idea that intelligence is a tool for searching for general solutions to problems. We define intelligence as the ability to acquire skills that narrow this search, diversify it and help steer it to more promising areas. We also provide suggestions for studying, measuring, and testing the various skills and abilities that a human-level intelligent machine needs to acquire. The document aims to be both implementation agnostic, and to provide an analytic, systematic, and scalable way to generate hypotheses that we believe are needed to meet the necessary conditions in the search for <b>general</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> We believe that such a framework is an important stepping stone for bringing together definitions, highlighting open problems, connecting researchers willing to collaborate, and for unifying the arguably most significant search of this century...|$|E
