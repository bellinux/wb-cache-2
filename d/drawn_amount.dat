40|$|The paper {{draws on}} actuarial mathematics, {{examining}} {{the role of}} housing in the welfare mix for older persons. New concepts for asset-based welfare, where the housing owned by the occupant {{is part of the}} investment portfolio comprised of state pension, occupational defined contribution (private) pension and one's residential property, are examined. We present how the variance of pension income after retirement is reduced by using residential property as the 4 th pillar of the pension system, as proposed in the EC Green Paper on Pensions (2010). The study is focusing on modelling the decumulation of the housing equity and the defined contribution private pension, incorporating insurance mechanisms for management of longevity. Here we propose a new model in which periodic payout that the beneficiary receives is the difference between the <b>amount</b> <b>drawn</b> and the annuity premium for longevity insurance. The paper shows how the <b>drawing</b> <b>amount</b> in the loan model ERS (reverse mortgage) is decreasing with the increasing interest rate, while the pension arising from defined contribution systems is increasing with the increasing interest rate. According to Markowitz's Portfolio Theory, these findings show that in combination of these products, the volatility of a combined pension cash flow from all pillars induced by volatile interest rates decreases, which improves the pension portfolio, i. e. where pensions from defined contribution systems exist...|$|R

40|$|Annealing {{combined}} with cold-drawing are the necessary method in {{the processing of}} Ni-Ti shape memory alloy thin wires. In this paper, the annealing temperature scan of 450 ~ 800 ?, time scan of 20 min~ 3 h and the cold-drawing amount of 6. 9 %~ 39 % were chosen, and their effects on the thermo and mechanical performance of the Ni- 50. 5 a. t. %Ti alloy wires have been studied. The DSC and tensile-recovery tests were adopted to obtain the phase transformation temperatures and mechanical hysteresis of the Ni-Ti SMA wires with different treatment conditions. The {{results show that the}} phase transition temperature of Ni-Ti wire can be changed by varying the annealing temperature and time; cold-drawing deformation and subsequent annealing have a great influence on the super-elasticity.

5000|$|Social Security has {{collected}} approximately $2.8 trillion more in payroll taxes and interest than {{have been paid}} out since tax collection began in 1937.

The funds borrowed from the program are part of the total national debt of $18.9 trillion as of December 2015. Due to interest, the Trust Fund will continue increasing through the end of 2020, reaching a peak of approximately $2.9 trillion. Social Security has the legal authority to <b>draw</b> <b>amounts</b> from other government revenue sources besides the payroll tax, to fully fund the program, while the Trust Fund exists. However, payouts greater than payroll tax revenue and interest income over time will liquidate the Trust Fund by 2035, meaning that only the ongoing payroll tax collections thereafter will be available to fund the program.|$|R
