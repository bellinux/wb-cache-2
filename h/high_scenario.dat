By 2019, worldwide capacity was projected to reach between 396 GW (low scenario) and 540 GW (<b>high</b> <b>scenario).</b> This corresponded to a more than doubling and tripling of installed capacity within five years, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The PV Market Alliance (PVMA), a {{consortium}} of several research bodies founded in 2014, forecast in 2015 that global PV capacity would reach 444-630 GW by 2020. In its low scenario, annual installations were projected to grow from 40 to 50 gigawatts by 2020, while its <b>high</b> <b>scenario</b> forecast deployment would increase from 60 to 90 GW between 2015-2020. The medium scenario therefore expected annual PV installations to grow from 50 GW to 70 GW and to reach 536 GW by 2020. PVMA's figures were in line with those published earlier by Solar Power Europe. In June 2015, Greentech Media (GTM) Research released its Global PV Demand Outlook for 2020. The company projected annual installations to increase from 40 GW to 135 GW and global cumulative capacity to reach almost 700 GW by 2020. GTM's outlook was the most aggressive of all forecasts in 2015, with projected deployment of 518 GW between 2015 and 2020, or {{more than twice as}} much as IEA's 225 GW baseline case scenario, published ten months earlier.|$|E

30|$|The {{effect of}} the white paper {{implementation}} is most noticeable in the White Paper <b>High</b> <b>scenario</b> where demand for transport nearly doubles from an annual average of 1.52 to 2.87  %.

40|$|We {{quantify}} the concentrations change of atmospheric pollutants and Radiative Forcing (RF) of short-lived components due to shipping emissions of NOx, SOx, CO, NMVOCs, BC and OC. A set of models {{is used to}} evaluate the period 2004 – 2030. This time period reflects expected increasing traffic in the Arctic region. Two datasets for ship emissions are used that may characterize the potential impact from shipping {{and the degree to which}} shipping controls may mitigate impacts: A high (<b>HIGH)</b> <b>scenario</b> and a low scenario with Maximum Feasible Reduction (MFR) of black carbon in the Arctic. In MFR, BC emissions in the Arctic are reduced with 70 % representing a combination technology performance and/or reasonable advances in single-technology performance. Both scenarios result in moderate to substantial increases in concentrations of pollutants both globally and in the Arctic. Exceptions are black carbon in the MFR scenario, and sulfur species and organic carbon in both scenarios due to the future phase-in of current regulation that reduces fuel sulfur content. In the season with potential transit traffic through the Arctic in 2030 significant increases occur for all pollutants in large parts of the Arctic. Net global RFs from 2004 – 2030 of 53 mW m&minus; 2 (HIGH) and 73 mW m&minus; 2 (MFR) are similar to those found for preindustrial to present net global aircraft RF. The found warming contrasts the cooling from historical ship emissions. The reason for this difference and the higher global forcing for the MFR scenario is mainly the reduced future fuel sulfur content resulting in less cooling from sulfate aerosols. Arctic regional forcing is largest in the <b>HIGH</b> <b>scenario</b> because other components become locally more important in polar latitudes. In the <b>HIGH</b> <b>scenario</b> ozone dominates the RF during Arctic summer and the transit season. RF due to BC in air, and snow and ice becomes of significance in Arctic spring.

40|$|Effects {{of future}} expansion/intensification of {{irrigated}} agriculture on groundwater and surface water levels and availability in a semi-arid watershed were evaluated using an integrated hydrologic model (MIKE SHE/MIKE 11) {{in conjunction with}} biophysical measurements. Improved water use efficiency, water storage, and energy policy options were evaluated {{for their ability to}} sustain the future (2035) increased groundwater withdrawals. Three future withdrawal scenarios (low =[*] 20, medium =[*] 30, high =[*] 50 wells/ 100 km 2 /year) based on the historical rate of growth of irrigation wells were formulated. While well drying from falling groundwater levels was limited to drought and consecutive below average rainfall years, under the current (2015) withdrawals, significant increases in frequency and duration (17 – 97 days/year) of well drying along with 13 – 26 % (19 – 37 mm) reductions in surface flows were predicted under the future withdrawals. Higher (27 – 108 %) energy demands of existing irrigation pumps due to declining groundwater levels and reduced hydroelectric generation due to decreased surface flows would create a vicious water-food-energy nexus in the future. Crop failure, one of the main causes of farmers’ emotional distress and death in the region, is predicted to exacerbate under the future withdrawal scenarios. Shift to negative net recharge (− 63 mm) and early and prolonged drying of wells under the <b>high</b> <b>scenario</b> will reduce the groundwater availability and negatively affect crop production in more than 60 % and 90 % of cropped areas in the Rabi (November–February) and summer (March–May) seasons, respectively during a drought year. Individual and combined demand (drip irrigation and reduced farm electricity subsidy) and supply (water storage) management options improved groundwater levels and reduced well drying by 55 – 97 days/year compared to business-as-usual management under the <b>high</b> <b>scenario.</b> The combined management (50 % drip conversion, 50 % reduction in subsidy, and enhanced water storage) mitigated well drying even during drought and consecutive below average rainfall years under the <b>high</b> <b>scenario.</b> A conservative economic evaluation for management options under the <b>high</b> <b>scenario</b> showed increases in crop production and per farmer annual profits by $ 987 –$ 1397 during a drought year (average household income = $ 1520 /year). A scale-up of results showed that diverting 50 % state power subsidy ($ 6 billion for 3 – 6 years) can almost entirely fund the conversion to drip irrigation ($ 4. 2 billion) and water storage structures ($ 2. 9 billion) and help meet the water supply demand of a 50 % increase in irrigated area under the <b>high</b> <b>scenario.</b> Converting flood to drip irrigation in 50 % of irrigated area under the <b>high</b> <b>scenario</b> can reduce the electric energy consumption (7 [*]× 106 Mwh/year) and carbon footprint (6000 Mt/year) of groundwater irrigation by 24 % in the state. Management options considered can potentially create a sustainable water-food-energy nexus in the larger semi-arid hard rock region. Reducing the power subsidy will require a strong political will since it {{has been used as a}} tool to win the elections in India. Considering future agricultural intensification, timely interventions are needed to ensure the livelihood and well-being of millions of small- and medium-scale farmers that rely on low storage, hard rock aquifers in the semi-arid regions of the world...|$|E

However, with health funding levels stagnant or falling, {{it is important to}} understand the cost and health impact associated with prevention technologies. This study is one of the first to attempt to quantify the cost and combined health impact of condom use, as a means to prevent unwanted pregnancy and to prevent transmission of STIs including HIV. This paper describes the analysis to make the case for investment in the male condom, including the cost, impact and cost-effectiveness by three scenarios (low in which 2015 condom use levels are maintained; medium in which condom use trends are used to predict condom use from 2016 - 2030; and high in which condom use is scaled up, as part of a package of contraceptives, to meet all unmet need for family planning by 2030 and to 90 % for HIV and STI prevention by 2016) for 81 countries from 2015 - 2030. An annual gap between current and desired use of 10. 9 billion condoms was identified (4. 6 billion for family planning and 6. 3 billion for HIV and STIs). Under a <b>high</b> <b>scenario</b> that completely reduces that gap between current and desired use of 10. 9 billion condoms, we found that by 2030 countries could avert 240 million DALYs.
