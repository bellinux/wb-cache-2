5|$|Borden {{launches}} a solo magic career and hires the silent, mysterious Fallon as his <b>ingénieur.</b> Borden courts and eventually marries Sarah, who {{gives birth to}} their daughter, Jess; but their relationship is shadowed by Sarah's intuition that Borden is keeping secrets and that sometimes he is lying {{when he says he}} loves her. At his first show, Borden's bullet catch trick is sabotaged by Angier, and Borden loses two fingers. Angier launches his own magic career, hiring Olivia Wenscombe as his assistant and Cutter as his <b>ingénieur.</b> During the finale of Angier's show, a disguised Borden sabotages Angier's bird cage act, which maims an audience member and ruins Angier's reputation.|$|E

In prison, Borden is visited by an agent of Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's {{daughter}} Jess in exchange for all of Borden's tricks. As a show of good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which Borden reads.|$|E

The most unusual feature of his design was the prominent forecastle that was built atop the forward part of the pressure hull, while the rear was virtually awash. This odd configuration gave the boat her nickname of toothbrush (brosse à dents).|$|E
500|$|Julian Jarrold's and Sam Mendes' {{producer}} approached Christopher Priest for {{an adaptation}} of his novel The Prestige. [...] Priest was impressed with Nolan's films Following and Memento, and subsequently, producer Valerie Dean brought the book to Nolan's attention. In October 2000, Nolan traveled to the United Kingdom to publicize Memento, as Newmarket Films was having difficulty finding a United States distributor. While in London, Nolan read Priest's book and shared the story with his brother while walking around in Highgate (a location later featured in the scene where Angier ransoms Borden's <b>ingénieur</b> in Highgate Cemetery). [...] The development process for The Prestige began as a reversal of their earlier collaboration: [...] Jonathan Nolan had pitched his initial story for Memento to his brother during a road trip.|$|E

Nolan said that even though {{it felt like the}} character of Cutter was written for Caine, it was not. Nolan noted that the character was written [...] "before I'd ever met" [...] Caine. Caine describes Cutter as [...] "a teacher, a father and a guide to Angier". Caine, in trying to create Cutter's nuanced portrait, altered his voice and posture. Nolan later said that [...] "Michael Caine’s character really becomes something of the heart of the film. He has a wonderful warmth and emotion to him that draws you into the story and allows you to have a point of view on these characters without judging them too harshly." ...|$|E
500|$|Both sides {{learned from}} the battle. [...] The French victory showed that to take Quebec, the cannon of [...] "Old England {{would have to be}} brought in". [...] Similarly, Frontenac {{realised}} the defences needed significant improvement, and in 1692, he gave <b>Ingénieur</b> du Roi Josué Berthelot de Beaucours the task of designing a fortress that could withstand a European-style siege. [...] This was delayed by the Canadian winter, and work commenced in the summer of 1693 on an earth rampart with large bastions to enclose the city, and pointed wooden stakes to top the walls. [...] A complete shore battery, known as the [...] "Royal battery", was built immediately after the siege. [...] It was shaped like a small bastion, and featured 14 gun embrasures to cover both sides of the Saint Laurence and the river itself.|$|E

The Kopås battery ceased firing at Blücher and engaged the next target, Lützow, scoring multiple hits. First engineer Leitende <b>Ingenieur</b> Fregattenkapitän Dip. Ing. Karl Thannemann wrote in his report that the hits from the guns on Drøbak, which were fired on the starboard side, were all between section IV and X in a length of [...] amidships, between B-turret and C-turret. However, all damage were on the port side. The shells must have traversed most of the superstructure before exploding.|$|E

500|$|Although {{most of the}} Home Fleet was not at {{the base}} at the time, U-47 managed to find a target, the {{battleship}} [...] Once she had spotted Royal Oak, she opened fire with her torpedoes. Her first two salvos did nothing more than sever an anchor chain. After reloading the bow tubes the last salvo of three torpedoes struck the British warship, causing severe flooding. Taking on a list of 15 degrees, her open portholes were submerged, worsening the flooding and increasing the list to 45 degrees; Royal Oak sank within 15 minutes with the loss of over 800 men. Following the attack, Prien received the nickname Der Stier von Scapa Flow ("The Bull of Scapa Flow"); the emblem of a snorting bull was then painted on the conning tower of U-47 and the image soon became the emblem of the entire 7th U-boat Flotilla. Prien was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, the first sailor of a U-boat and the second member of the Kriegsmarine to receive this decoration. The rest of the crew members were awarded the Iron Cross. Two other U-47 crew members also earned the Knight's Cross later on during World War II: the chief engineer (Leitender <b>Ingenieur)</b> Johann-Friedrich Wessels and 1st watch officer (I. Wachoffizier) Engelbert Endrass.|$|E

2500|$|The {{submarine}} {{was designed}} by <b>Ingenieur</b> Kontor Lübeck (IKL) headed by Ulrich Gabler and is largely based on previous German submarine designs (in particular the Type 206) with increased equipment. The design is single hulled and allows the commanding officer to see the entire submarine from the bow to stern while standing at the periscope. Four 120-cell batteries are located forward and aft of the command center in the lower deck and make up about 25% of the boat's displacement. Two main ballast tanks with forward and aft trim tanks allow the boat to dive. [...] They are powered by four MTU diesels and four AEG generators. The AEG electric motor is attached directly to a five- or seven-bladed propeller.|$|E

He was {{originally}} named Kusno Sosrodiharjo [...] Following Javanese custom, he was renamed after surviving a childhood illness. After graduating from a native primary school in 1912, {{he was sent to}} the Europeesche Lagere School (a Dutch primary school) in Mojokerto. Subsequently, in 1916, Sukarno went to a Hogere Burgerschool (a Dutch type higher level secondary school) in Surabaya, where he met Tjokroaminoto, a nationalist and founder of Sarekat Islam. In 1920, Sukarno married Tjokroaminoto's daughter Siti Oetari. In 1921, he began to study civil engineering (with focusing on architecture) at the Technische Hoogeschool te Bandoeng (Bandoeng Institute of Technology), where he obtained an <b>Ingenieur</b> degree (abbreviated as [...] "Ir.", a Dutch type engineer's degree) in 1926. During his study in Bandung, Sukarno became romantically involved with Inggit Garnasih, the wife of Sanoesi, the owner of the boarding house where he lived as a student. Inggit was 13 years older than Sukarno. In March 1923, Sukarno divorced Siti Oetari to marry Inggit (who also divorced her husband Sanoesi). Sukarno later divorced Inggit and married Fatmawati.|$|E
