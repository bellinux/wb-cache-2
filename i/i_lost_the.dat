[...] Cotto landed 105 of 506 punches thrown (21%), while Mayweather landed 179 punches of 687 thrown (26%).|$|E

He elaborated, [...] "In the end I didn't lose the songs, but <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> sound. ... I literally threw them away by giving them to very good people to arrange but not being involved myself, {{almost to the point of}} indifference." ...|$|E

500|$|Webber {{said he was}} {{at fault}} for causing the {{accident}} between himself and Rosberg on lap nineteen; [...] "I thought I'd managed to catch it but <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> car and made contact with the wall. Then Nico hit me, which wrecked his race as well. It was my mistake and it wasn't my day." [...] Rosberg was puzzled over the incident; he said, [...] "I don't understand why Webber didn't hit the brakes. It was crazy to roll back across the track like that." [...] Gerhard Berger, who raced in Formula One for thirteen years, courted controversy when he accused Webber of causing the incident deliberately and claimed Webber planned to take out either Alonso or Hamilton. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner defended Webber {{in an interview with}} The Daily Telegraph, saying it was [...] "absurd" [...] that Webber attempted to take out another competitor and stated the car suffered heavy damage with the collision with the wall. Webber later went to Rosberg and apologised for the crash on the Friday before the Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E
500|$|Hanna {{stated that}} he would accept no office in the McKinley administration, as he feared it {{would be seen as}} a reward for his {{political}} efforts. [...] He had long wished to be a senator, speaking of this desire as early as 1892. [...] Senator Sherman, now aged almost 74, faced a difficult re-election battle with the Democrats and the Foraker faction in 1898. [...] On January 4, 1897, McKinley offered Sherman the office of Secretary of State; he immediately accepted. [...] The poor record Sherman posted prior to his departure from office in 1898 led to attacks on Hanna, suggesting that a senile man had been placed in a key Cabinet position to accommodate him. Foraker, in his memoirs, strongly implied that Sherman was moved out of the way to allow Hanna to have his Senate seat. [...] An embittered Sherman stated in a letter after his departure as secretary, [...] "When [...] urged me to accept the position of Secretary of State, I accepted with some reluctance and largely to promote the wishes of Mark Hanna. [...] The result was that <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> position both of Senator and Secretary... They deprived me of the high office of Senator by the temporary appointment as Secretary of State." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the tension}} between the two {{seemingly}} unresolved, following England's victory over Australia in the 4th Ashes Test at Melbourne which saw England retain the Ashes {{for the first time since}} the 1986-87 Ashes, Pietersen claimed that without the removal of Moores, England would not have been in a position to beat Australia, claiming the change in regime brought about a better working climate within the squad. [...] Pietersen went on to say: [...] "You know what - I have never said this before - <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> captaincy, I got rid of the captaincy for the good of English cricket, and we would not be here today if I had not done what I did then." ...|$|E

She also remarks that the performance of [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] by the show's primary Glee club, New Directions, was disgraceful because [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> election, I didn't sing about being a loser, I twittered that Obama is a terrorist"; this remark almost started an argument between her and fellow judge Sister Mary Constance (Loretta Devine).|$|E
2500|$|Bedridden by illness for {{the last}} two years of his life, Nibley died on 24 February 2005 in his home in Provo, Utah at the age of 94. [...] His son Alex Nibley later edited his World War II memoirs, {{published}} in 2006. [...] He gave the materials for his final book to FARMS in the fall of 2002, which was published in March 2010 as commemoration for what would have been his 100th birthday. [...] Nibley's daughter Martha Beck published Leaving the Saints: How <b>I</b> <b>Lost</b> <b>the</b> Mormons and Found My Faith in 2005, describing her departure from the LDS Church, and claiming in 1990 she had recovered repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse by her father. [...] The allegations received national publicity. Nibley had long been aware of the allegations and denied them. Beck's seven siblings responded saying the accusations were false. Boyd Petersen, Nibley's biographer and son-in-law, also rejected Beck's claims.|$|E

2500|$|Discussing {{his life}} in New York, Popović said: [...] "I never stopped keeping tabs on things back home. Personally, I felt like my life ended. War, the country disintegrated, <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> job that I worked for so many years, the only thing I had left was raising my children. There was a {{newsstand}} on the 42nd Street that sold Večernje novosti and Vreme and I'd go there every day to get the paper and read it cover to cover. I was well informed. I also had contacts with numerous human rights {{organizations such as the}} Human Rights Watch and UN Human Rights Committee that asked for my input on the situation once they found out I'm in New York. In the beginning, the information coming out of the Balkans was unclear, incomplete, and misinterpreted. Yugoslavia was low on their list of priorities. Germany was uniting, USSR was disintegrating, we were the last item on the priority list. I never turned down invitations to speak at meetings and lectures that were being held everywhere from schools, churches and city chambers. People from all over the former Yugoslavia would come and I always used my participation to insist on the establishment of the international war crimes tribunal".|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{to public}} release, Meirelles {{screened}} Blindness to test audiences. He described {{the impact of}} test screenings: [...] "If {{you know how to}} use it, how to ask the right questions, it can be really useful." [...] A test screening of Meirelles' first cut in Toronto resulted in ten percent of the audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early. Meirelles ascribed the problem to a rape scene that takes place partway through the film, and edited the scene to be much shorter in the final cut. Meirelles explained his goal, [...] "When I shot and edited these scenes, I did it in a very technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, and <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> sense of their brutality. Some women were really angry with the film, and I thought, 'Wow, maybe I crossed the line.' I went back not to please the audience but so they would stay involved {{until the end of the}} story." [...] He also found that a New York City test screening expressed concern about a victim in the film failing to take revenge. Meirelles believed this concern to reflect what Americans have learned to expect in their cinema.|$|E
2500|$|The most remembered shot where Davis {{missed the}} fine {{cut into the}} corner pocket was {{unfortunately}} not discussed in detail. Davis states [...] "I was saying to myself, don't hit it thick" [...] and [...] "that's how you bottle it, by hitting it thick." [...] However he did not elaborate on whether {{he was forced to}} use side spin to avoid a possible in off foul stroke into the middle pocket (This would have cost him the match) or whether he played it with centre ball striking. He summarised: [...] "although I missed the black, it wasn't that shot which lost the match. There were other shots earlier in the frame." [...] In particular, Davis mentions how close he was to being able to pot a pink which he snookered himself on that changed the course of the match. David Vine closes the programme by asking both players their opinion regarding some voices claiming the match must have been fixed. This preposterous notion gives a fascinating insight into the prevailing naivety in some quarters with regard to Snooker in 1985, when it was still a comparatively young TV sport and reaching its zenith in popularity. Davis replies [...] "Well, its simple. They don't understand. If anyone ever {{came up to me and}} asked if the match was fixed, I would just say yeah it was, yeah. It's just not even worth arguing with people like that." [...] Davis allowed himself to joke about the defeat, making a joke about being asked by a petrol station attendant if he wanted glasses (free tumblers) and has now admitted that he will probably be remembered more for the final he did not win in 1985 than for the six he did. But barely months after the final he states [...] "although <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> match, it was great to be involved in. To be involved in something like that." [...] The programme was later released on DVD as [...] "The Greatest Snooker Final Of All Time" [...] by Retro Videos. Both players now commentate on BBC's snooker coverage and are often reminded of that match. The [...] finish was voted the ninth greatest sporting moment of all time in a 2002 Channel 4 poll.|$|E
