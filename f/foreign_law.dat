He has also defended the Supreme Court's use of <b>foreign</b> <b>law</b> and international law as persuasive (but not binding) authority in its decisions. However, Breyer is also recognized to be deferential to the interests of law enforcement and to legislative judgments in the Supreme Court's First Amendment rulings. Breyer has also demonstrated a consistent pattern of deference to Congress, voting to overturn congressional legislation at a lower rate than any other Supreme Court justice since 1994.|$|E
5|$|Ginsburg {{has also}} been an {{advocate}} for using <b>foreign</b> <b>law</b> and norms to shape U.S. law in judicial opinions, a view not shared by some of her conservative colleagues. Ginsburg supports using foreign interpretations of law for the persuasive value and possible wisdom, not as precedent which the court is bound to follow. Ginsburg has expressed the view that looking to international law is well-ingrained in tradition in American law, counting John Henry Wigmore and President John Adams as internationalists. Ginsburg's own reliance on international law dates back to her time as an attorney; during her first argument before the court, 1971's Reed v. Reed, she cited two German cases. In her concurring opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger 539 U.S. 306 (2016), a decision upholding Michigan Law School's affirmative action admissions policy, Ginsburg noted there was accord between the notion that affirmative action admissions policies would have an end point and agrees with international treaties designed to combat racial and gender based discrimination.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{sets forth}} three {{arguments}} {{in relation to}} the regulation of Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in national <b>foreign</b> investment <b>laws.</b> First, there is a broad convergence in national <b>foreign</b> investment <b>laws</b> on how to regulate Chinese SOEs when they make cross-border investments. Second, the nature and function of SOEs in China’s socialist market economy is still poorly understood. Consequently, the broad convergence in SOE regulation in national <b>foreign</b> investment <b>laws</b> remains too crude a legal criterion in practice. Third, the complexity of Chinese SOEs in Chinese political and economic context calls for a more nuanced approach to regulate SOEs in national <b>foreign</b> investment <b>laws...</b>|$|R
