25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to <b>get</b> <b>in.</b> <b>To</b> be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E
25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! But I can still see the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> see for themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E

They were my team, I went to support them as a boy and being a Geordie it's in-bred, you follow the club still the same today." [...] Like several other future professionals from the area, he played football for Wallsend Boys Club. He was also selected for the Newcastle Schools representative team, and at the age of 13 was among a group of players from the team selected to serve as ball boys at the 1974 Football League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.|$|E

As quoted by Lions in a September 2000 interview on Jake E.

500|$|During December 2008, {{while still}} in the process of drafting, Loeb said that he had been riveted by the Bernard Madoff {{headlines}} and showed interest in referencing him in the film, noting: [...] "the thing that is so crazy about this story is that Ponzi schemes seem to be the simplest low-class scam," [...] and [...] "but this was carried out in the highest echelon of high finance. You couldn't even <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> see this guy unless you had $2 million to invest." [...] Stone clarified that Madoff will not be mentioned in the film, commenting that he considered Madoff's actions to be [...] "a crook running a Ponzi scheme" [...] which is [...] "legal robbery." [...] The filmmaker returned to the project in April on the strength of this script, feeling Loeb's draft was [...] "so great" [...] that he did not feel the need to touch it, although he did have the option.|$|E
500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew {{the back of his}} head out. I was down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and out the other side. If I wanted to get about I had to crawl on my hands and knees and I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn't <b>get</b> <b>in</b> (<b>to</b> the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E

2500|$|Cheri Nolan, a Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President George W.

Nolan stated, [...] "I've {{never seen anything like it}} as far as the technology and physical set up. Once you're inside you really can't tell where you are - what's north, south, east or west. The way it's designed, it's an interesting kind of setup," [...] Nolan said. [...] "Because of the high value of targets they have there – on a world scale, whether it be a drug cartel or terrorists – they are as concerned with someone trying to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> break someone out as much as they are about inmates trying to escape. The protection around the prison is pretty remarkable." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} {{became so}} tense that {{war with the}} United States seemed imminent. On April 22, 1914, on the initiative of Felix A.

Carothers wrote to Secretary William Jennings Bryan: [...] "As {{far as he was concerned}} we could keep Vera Cruz [...] and hold it so tight that not even water could <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> Huerta and [...] [...] [...] he could not feel any resentment". Whether trying to please the U.S. government or through the diplomatic efforts of Sommerfeld and Carothers, or maybe as a result of both, Villa stepped out from under Carranza’s stated foreign policy.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{sold out}} Paris concert, {{multiple}} fans {{who were not}} able to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> see the performance because of its 2,000 person limit began to throw stones at the venue, and were consequently tear gassed by police. It was also popular to see moshing and stage diving at their shows, but the band members discouraged this type of behavior. [...] "They hated it and they tried to stop it as much as possible," [...] artist Arturo Vega recalled, [...] "but it would happen. Kids are really resourceful. Once the lawsuits started coming in, a lot of clubs tried to ban it, too. Sometimes the security made it difficult for them, you know. Once, we were in Tijuana--and of coursem in Tiuana, who cares!

While talking about his attitude and upbringing, Ringer mentioned, [...] "A lot of that just comes from my upbringing. I have a tremendous mother and father, I {{grew up in the}} church, I have a very religious family. I’m not all about myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t be able {{to go out there and}} compete anyway. So I never look at it as a selfish thing—I never want all the attention or want it to be about me, because I never want to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> a situation where God has to humble me. I know for a fact that I am not doing it by myself; it is because of Him that I can compete over and over again. That’s basically how I grew up.
