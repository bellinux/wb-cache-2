5|$|Banksia dentata {{is one of}} four Banksia species {{collected}} by Sir Joseph Banks in 1770, and one of the four species published in 1782 as part of Carolus Linnaeus the Younger's original description of Banksia. Within the genus, it is classified in the series Salicinae, a group of species from Australia's <b>eastern</b> <b>states.</b> Genetic studies show it is a basal member (early offshoot) within the group. Banksia dentata is found in tropical grassland known as savanna, associated with Pandanus and Melaleuca. It regenerates from bushfire by regrowing from its woody base, known as a lignotuber.|$|E
5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints who {{remained}} in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford {{the costs of the}} wagon, teams of oxen, and supplies that would be required for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund, to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the <b>eastern</b> <b>states</b> and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Chalciporus piperatus occur singly, scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground. The fungus occurs {{naturally}} in or near coniferous or beech and oak woodlands, often on sandy soils. Fruit bodies appear in Europe in late summer and autumn from August to November. The fungus is widespread across North America, fruiting from July to October in the <b>eastern</b> <b>states</b> and from September to January on the Pacific Coast. It is found in Mexico and Central America. In Asia, it has been collected from Pakistan, West Bengal (India), and Guangdong Province (China). In South Africa, it is known from the southwestern Cape Province and the eastern Transvaal Province.|$|E

5|$|However, some {{problems}} have been encountered with basing agencies in the <b>eastern</b> <b>states.</b> For example, Frontex, the new border agency, has had problems recruiting skilled experts because many {{do not want to}} live in the agency's host city, Warsaw, due to its relatively low wages and standard of living. In addition, plans to place the headquarters of Galileo in Prague met with opposition over security concerns that the city would not be safe enough for such a sensitive agency.|$|E

5|$|The first road in {{the region}} was the Buffalo Trace, an old bison trail that ran from the Falls of the Ohio to Vincennes. After the capitol was {{relocated}} to Corydon, several local roads were created to connect the new capitol to the Ohio River at Mauckport and to New Albany. The first major {{road in the}} state was the National Road, a project funded by the federal government. The road entered Indiana in 1829, connecting Richmond, Indianapolis, and Terre Haute with the <b>eastern</b> <b>states</b> and eventually Illinois and Missouri in the west. The state adopted the advanced methods used to build the national road on a statewide basis and began {{to build a new}} road network that was usable year-round. The North-South Michigan Road was built in the 1830s, connecting Michigan and Kentucky and passing through Indianapolis in the middle. These two new roads were roughly perpendicular within the state and served as the foundation for a road system to encompass all of Indiana.|$|E
5|$|The {{state and}} federal governments also had {{conflicts}} on the economic front. UMNO leaders feared that the economic dominance of Singapore would inevitably shift political power away from Kuala Lumpur. Despite earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore refused to provide Sabah and Sarawak {{the full extent of the}} loans previously agreed to for the economic development of the two <b>eastern</b> <b>states.</b> The Bank of China branch of Singapore was closed by the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur as it was suspected of funding communists. The situation escalated to such an extent that talks between UMNO and the PAP broke down, and abusive speeches and writings became rife on both sides. UMNO extremists called for the arrest of Lee Kuan Yew.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1940, {{amid the}} tide of German successes in Europe, there was an influx of volunteers for the 2nd AIF. As a result, the Australian {{government}} decided to raise a third volunteer division for overseas service, named the 8th Division. Established around three infantry brigades—the 22nd, 23rd and 27th—the division was supported by corps troops including engineers, cavalry, artillery, pioneers and a machine gun battalion for direct fire support. Within this formation, the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion came into being on 25 November 1940, when Lieutenant Colonel Michael Anketell, a First World War veteran who had commanded a Militia infantry battalion before the war, established his headquarters at Northam Camp, near Perth, Western Australia. While {{the rest of the}} 8th Division had drawn its personnel mainly from the more populous <b>eastern</b> <b>states</b> of New South Wales and Victoria, {{the decision was made to}} select personnel for the 2/4th only from those who were already enlisted and conducting training in the west. While potentially parochial, it was a primarily a pragmatic decision to reduce the time it would take to concentrate the unit and complete its training.|$|E
5|$|Some doubt {{exists as}} to whether the current {{classification}} accurately represents relationships within the Banksia spinulosa complex. B.spinulosa var.collina is a form of inland gorges and tablelands in central Queensland, but is a coastal plant on the New South Wales central and north coast. B.spinulosa var.spinulosa, on the other hand, is coastal in central Queensland and in New South Wales south of Sydney. Similarly, B.spinulosa var.cunninghamii is widely separated between New South Wales and Victorian forms (where the longer leaved form was originally called B.prionophylla by Meissner). Notably both B.spinulosa var.spinulosa and B.spinulosa var.collina in northern Queensland have old spikes bare as opposed to them having persistent old flower parts in New South Wales and Victoria. Mast listed B.spinulosa var.collina and B.spinulosa var.neoanglica as sister clades in 1998, with B.spinulosa var.spinulosa and B.spinulosa var.cunninghamii flanking these. Alex George also reports that the taxon should be reviewed. A molecular study with specimens of each subspecies from the three mainland <b>eastern</b> <b>states</b> they occur would shed light on this matter.|$|E
5|$|One synonym, Iridomyrmex greensladei, was {{described}} as a separate species from the meat ant based on the anatomical differences of its head and pronotum (the dorsal portion of the prothorax's exoskeletal plates), which are the same colour as its mesosoma. In the meat ant, the head and pronotum are usually lighter than the mesosoma. American entomologist Steve Shattuck notes that the two ants are non-sympatric (they exist in the same geographic area and regularly encounter each other), and supporting evidence to separate them as two distinct species emerged when the enzymes esterase and amylase were examined and the results show that they had different amylase allele. These examinations, however, did not take any account of any distinction in colour between populations previously known as I. greensladei and I. purpureus. For example, colonies residing in Western Australia may have lighter heads whereas those living in the <b>eastern</b> <b>states</b> have darker heads. An unpublished study examining the mitochondrial DNA did not find any distinction between eastern and western populations of I. greensladei and I. purpureus. Additional evidence suggests that the populations found in the east and west are the same species. Despite this evidence, there are several problems: forms intended to be I. greensladei were found in the Yorke Peninsula by a 1987 study, which noted that while the ants were morphologically indistinguishable from both I. greensladei and I. purpureus populations, their nests only contained a single nest hole (whereas I. purpureus nests have many). Shattuck also collected workers for his holotype and paratype specimens from Israelite Bay in Western Australia, rather than collecting those from Yorke Peninsula. The forms in Yorke Peninsula have also never been subject to study, so future research may shed light {{as to whether or not}} these ants are genetically different from the meat ant.|$|E
