A [...] "broadcast band" [...] was defined, consisting of 96 frequencies, spaced every 10 kilohertz, from 550 to 1500 kHz. Six frequencies — 690, 730, 840, 910, 960, and 1030 — were restricted for use only by Canadian stations, leaving 90 available for U.S. assignments.

40|$|This paper reviews {{selected}} {{literature on}} workload, noting critical issues and efforts directed {{at a more}} <b>equitable</b> estimation, <b>assignment</b> and evaluation of faculty workload. It underlines the need to consider all factors and aspects of faculty work in assigning and evaluating workload. A flexible approach to evaluation is advocated since faculty have different strengths and interests and departments have different demands and requirements. It is also suggested that flexible formulas may be applied in evaluating faculty at the College of The Bahamas and that they need not be measured in an identical or uniform manner...|$|R
40|$|It {{is noted}} that modern {{economics}} cannot decide which economic {{system is the}} best way of organizing production. In particular, support is given to Nelson (1981) who claims that modern economics does not provide any substantial argument in favor of private enterprise being the best. However, rather than concluding that government control or socialist planning could do at least as well, this essay explores the alternative hypothesis that the organizationally static framework of most of modern economics is too narrow to see the entire truth. Connected to Schumpeter's and Hayek's approaches, an organizationally dynamic analytical framework is outlined and shown to reveal important advantages of private enterprise, in particular of contestable private enterprise with <b>equitable</b> risk <b>assignment.</b> This argument is qualified by showing that even such a system may suffer from organization failures which can be alleviated by selection-neutral industrial policy, including government entrepreneurship on underdeveloped markets...|$|R
40|$|Mr Trukhtanov {{has made}} his own summary of and {{response}} to my own account of <b>equitable</b> (and statutory) <b>assignment,</b> and how notice of assignment operates within them. Having been reminded of how the cases on the topic are usually understood, readers {{will have to make}} up their own minds. While there is, always, room for further thought, {{it is important not to}} lose sight of two fairly important distinctions. Where A is the debtor, B is the creditor, and C is an assignee to whom B has assigned the chose in action arising from A’s debt obligation, a distinction should be drawn between: the question to whom the debtor is liable; and what the debtor is obliged to do to be discharged from that debt obligation. A distinction should also be drawn between cases where A has paid B in satisfaction of the contractual promise (thus discharging the contractual obligation by precise performance) and cases where A has not...|$|R

40|$|Notice {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the <b>equitable</b> <b>assignment</b> of legal choses in action, such as a contractual debt. As noted in a recent treatise, once the debtor is given notice of the equitable assignment: (i) should she pay the sum owed to her creditor, she is not discharged from her obligation but will have to make payment again to the assignee [the 2 ̆ 7 no discharge after notice 2 ̆ 7 rule]; (ii) the assignee’s right against the debtor has priority against subsequent assignments by the assignor, in order of precedence of notice [the rule as to priorities]; and (iii) the debtor is no longer entitled to assert such equities as may arise between herself and the creditor postnotice to reduce her liability to the assignee by way of setoff [the rule as to equities]. Leaving aside discussion of the second and third of these rules for another day, this paper will focus on an examination of the 2 ̆ 7 no discharge after notice 2 ̆ 7 rule. This is prompted because the rule as applied in the context of <b>equitable</b> <b>assignment</b> of a debt presents a contradiction: it does not explain how it is that the common law rules as to discharge by precise performance and the invariability of contractual obligations are displaced by what appear to be equitable doctrines relating to assignment and notice thereof. By examining the mechanics and subject matter of an <b>equitable</b> <b>assignment</b> of a chose in action, this paper will demonstrate that the rule may, perhaps, have been too broadly stated and that the true position is quite otherwise: that a debtor is discharged from her obligation to make payment so long as she precisely performs her obligations as set out in the contract, even if the rights under that contract have been assigned to a third party to that contract, the equitable assignee, and even if she has been notified of such assignment. The paper will then examine whether the same may be true in the case of a statutory assignment...|$|E
40|$|Several {{indivisible}} {{goods are}} to be divided among two or more players, whose bids for the goods determine their prices. An <b>equitable</b> <b>assignment</b> of the goods at competitive prices is given by a fair-division procedure, called the Gap Procedure, that ensures (1) nonnegative prices that never exceed the bid of the player receiving the good; (2) Pareto optimality, though coupled with possible envy; (3) monotonicity, such that higher bids never hurt in obtaining a good; (4) sincere bids that preclude negative utility; and (5) prices that are partially independent of the amounts bid (as in a Vickrey auction). A variety of applications are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{a type of}} bias which stems from the mathematical algorithm often used to determine an optimal match between two groups. We compare two different solution concepts for the matching assignment problem: the traditionally stable solution vs. a multiplicative utility approach that should avoid the bias. Simulation modeling leads us to conclude that: (1) With respect to all sizes compared in our experiment, applicants and employers groups were always treated far more equally under the multiplicative utility approach than the stable approach. (2) When using the stable algorithm, {{the size of the}} bias is affected {{by the size of the}} problem (i. e., the larger the problem size is the larger the performance discrepancy between two groups of participants). Further analyses of the sensitivity of the finding to different assumptions (e. g., correlation in the preference orderings of the two groups, or use of nonlinear conversion from ranks to utilities) also resulted in a superior performance of the multiplicative utility algorithm in terms of a more <b>equitable</b> outcome. personnel <b>assignment</b> problem, multiplicative utility, matching algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Challenges in the {{healthcare}} industry, including nursing shortages and low nursing retention, have resulted in nurses’ job dissatisfaction. Improving work environment and workload can lead to improved and <b>equitable</b> nursing shift <b>assignments,</b> which may improve nursing job satisfaction. The purpose of this EBP project was to (a) implement a patient acuity tool in the hospital unit, (b) assess its effectiveness in appropriating nursing shift assignments, and (c) evaluate its effect on nursing job satisfaction. The Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) Model {{was used as a}} guide to facilitate the transition of the best evidence into practice. As suggested within the evidence, utilization of a patient acuity tool in appropriating nursing shift assignments should increase nursing job satisfaction as compared with assignments based on charge nurse’s judgment alone. Based on an extensive review of the best available evidence from the literature and professional input from staff nurses, a patient acuity tool was created. Upon organizational and academic approval, education of the staff nurses on tool utilization was completed and the project was implemented. To determine the effectiveness of the tool, pre-and post-implementation, the Nursing Workplace Satisfaction Questionnaire (NWSQ) was administered. Paired sample t tests were conducted to analyze mean pre-and post-test scores in all three domains (intrinsic, extrinsic and relational) of the NWSQ. Statistically significant differences (t (19) = - 2. 67, p 3 ̆c. 05), were only found in one item of the intrinsic domain addressing whether the participants were able to learn on the job (M = 1. 75, SD =. 55, M = 2. 1, SD =. 85). No other items? on the survey were statistically significant (p 3 ̆e. 05). All of the project participants stated that the use of the tool was quick and easy, 60...|$|R
40|$|Choses {{in action}} are {{valuable}} assets. This has compelled (and been facilitated by) {{the development of}} legal devices such as <b>equitable</b> <b>assignment</b> to allow holders of choses to deal with them, inter vivos. This thesis makes two claims. First, equitable assignments are best conceived as a composite of a bare trust and an atypical agency where the assignee is authorised to invoke the assignor's entitlements against the obligor to the chose assigned, as the assignee pleases. On this conception, equitable assignments merely entail generation of {{a new set of}} jural relations as between assignor and assignee. Though these affect how the jural relations between assignor and obligor are to be discharged, those jural relations are left intact and unchanged, unless the requirements for 'statutory' assignments have been satisfied. Second, 'statutory' assignments are regulatory in effect. Where a debt or other chose in action has been validly equitably assigned and the requirements in s 136 (1) Law of Property Act 1925 are satisfied, the specific entitlements set out in sections 136 (1) (a), (b) and (c) will be passed from the assignor and transferred to the assignee. But that is only true with regards entitlements falling within those provisions, and the set of entitlements listed therein is not exhaustive. The composite model of <b>equitable</b> <b>assignment,</b> and the clarification of the nature of 'statutory' assignment, reduces confusion over their operation and effects. Accordingly, this thesis tempers the urge towards legislative reform of the law of assignment: reform may not be needed since the law is not incoherent, though it is certainly complex. And if targeted law reform to simplify the law on assignment be thought desirable, it is as well to know what one is reforming. </p...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{stormwater}} utility fees {{have been}} identified as a reasonable and effective funding mechanism to address stormwater problems. The fees provide for an <b>equitable</b> <b>assignment</b> of cost that is in proportion to the demand placed on the drainage system by an individual property's runoff. The citizens of DeKalb County are facing an increasingly acute and complex set of storm water infrastructure challenges as the County continues to grow and prosper. An effective storm water management and infrastructure system is required to protect properties from flooding, to preserve and enhance the environmental quality of area watersheds, and to comply with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements. (NPDES is part of the Clean Water Act enforced by the Georgia Environmental Protection Department.) A stormwater utility fee system must {{meet the needs of the}} program expenditures, be dedicated to stormwater utility programs, continue to ensure long-term effective implementation and environmental stewardship and be legally defensible within the state of Georgia. DeKalb County’s stormwater utility fee system incorporated data from the County’s Geographical Information System (GIS) and the Tax Assessor’s database to assign the fees for each parcel within unincorporated DeKalb County. This paper describes in more detail the technical methods for calculating and assigning these fees. Figure 1 : DeKalb County, GeorgiaSponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division U. S.

40|$|Neuroscience is {{generating}} {{vast amounts}} of highly diverse data which is of potential interest to researchers beyond the labs {{in which it is}} collected. In particular, quantitative neuroanatomical data is relevant {{to a wide variety of}} areas including studies of development, aging, pathology and in biophysically oriented computational modeling. Moreover, the relatively discrete and well-defined nature of the data make it an ideal application for developing systems designed to facilitate data archiving, sharing and reuse. At present, the only widely used forms of dissemination are figures and tables in published papers which suffer from inaccessibility and the loss of machine-readability. They may also present only an averaged or otherwise selected subset of the available data. Numerous database projects are in progress to address these shortcomings. They employ a variety of architectures and philosophies, each with its own merits and disadvantages. One axis on which they may be distinguished is the degree of top-down control, or curation, involved in data entry. Here we consider one extreme of this scale in which there is no curation, minimal standardization, and a wide degree of freedom in the form of records used to document data. Such a scheme has advantages in the ease of database creation and in the <b>equitable</b> <b>assignment</b> of perceived intellectual property by keeping the control of data in the hands of the experts who collected it. It does, however, require a more sophisticated infrastructure than conventional databases since the software must be capable of organizing diverse and differently documented data sets in an effective way. Several components of a software system to provide this infrastructure are now in place. Examples are presented showing how these tools can b [...] ...|$|E
