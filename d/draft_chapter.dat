50|$|The Electronic Frontier Foundation {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the leaked <b>draft</b> <b>chapter</b> on intellectual property covering copyright, trademarks, and patents. In the US, they believed this was likely to further entrench controversial aspects of US copyright law (such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act) and restrict the ability of Congress to engage in domestic law reform to meet the evolving IP needs of American citizens and the innovative technology sector. Standardization of copyright provisions by other signatories would also require significant changes to other countries' copyright laws. These, according to EFF, include obligations for countries to expand copyright terms, restrict fair use, adopt criminal sanctions for copyright infringement that is done without a commercial motivation (ex. file sharing of copyrighted digital media), place greater liability on internet intermediaries, escalate protections for digital locks and create new threats for journalists and whistleblowers.|$|E

The main aim of the meeting was to review <b>draft</b> <b>chapters</b> for the Group’s report on the Future of Hydrology {{to be published in}} the “Red Book ” series by IAHS Press in 2005. At the Group’s last meeting, at the IUGG 2003 /IAHS Assembly in Sapporo, Japan, in July 2003, an initial structure of the report had been identified. Since then four specialist subgroups had prepared <b>draft</b> <b>chapters</b> for the report on the topics of: global water resources assessments and water resource management, land surface processes, surface and subsurface hydrology (including water quality and ecohydrology), water policy and societal needs. On Day One of the meeting the <b>draft</b> <b>chapters</b> were presented by each subgroup {{to the rest of the}} Group and evaluated. From this discussion it was decided to restructure the report to create a more unified and logical document. Sections of the <b>draft</b> <b>chapters</b> will be incorporated in the revised report structure and each chapter will be multi-authored. The report will not aim to provide a comprehensive review of hydrology since this can be found in numerous textbooks, but instead it will summarise the group’s discussions of the current and future stat...|$|R

The couple become engaged a year later but never marry as Sophie dies of consumption a few days after her 15th birthday. The blue flower of the novel's title is the subject of the first chapter of a story that von Hardenberg is writing. In it, a young man longs to see the blue flower that [...] "lies incessantly at his heart, so that he can imagine and think about nothing else". Von Hardenberg reads his <b>draft</b> <b>chapter</b> to Sophie and others, and asks [...] "what is the meaning of this blue flower?"

5000|$|Evidence Aid {{seeks to}} bring {{together}} systematic reviews of relevance to disasters, humanitarian crises, and major healthcare emergencies, in a single online resource {{where they can be}} accessed free of charge and are available to anyone. Though information on best practice and low-cost interventions may be known in the medical, scientific or academic communities, this same information may not be available or easily found by communities or countries in crisis. Evidence Aid and its volunteers search the literature identifying relevant systematic reviews and works with others to produce short evidence summaries so that the information can be easily understood and applied by end users, in this case, those who have suffered as a result of disasters or those facing or who are experiencing humanitarian crises. The organization then uploads them to the searchable resource page where they are offered for the use of all. Additional resources are added as the needs are identified.

The administration's Council on Environmental Quality chief of staff Philip Cooney deleted all references to surface temperature reconstructions showing world temperatures rising over the last 1,000 years, and on 21 April 2003 sent a memo to Kevin O’Donovan in the Office of the Vice President stating [...] "The recent paper of Soon-Baliunas contradicts a dogmatic view held {{by many in the}} climate science community that the past century was the warmest in the past millennium and signals human induced “global warming.” ... We plan to begin to refer to this study in Administration communications on the science of global climate change; in fact, CEQ just inserted a reference to it in the final <b>draft</b> <b>chapter</b> on global climate change contained in EPA’s first “State of the Environment” report. ... With both the National Academy and IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) holding that the 20th Century is the warmest of the past thousand years (see below), this recent study begins to provide a counterbalance on the point to those two authorities. It represents an opening to potentially invigorate debate on the actual climate history of the past 1000 years and whether that history reinforces or detracts from our level of confidence regarding the potential human influence on global climate change." ...|$|E

Dennis J. Baker (<b>Draft</b> <b>Chapter</b> (2013/14): Reinterpreting Criminal Complicity, Forthcoming. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2507529. The title of Baker's paper is {{basically}} part of the ratio of R v Jogee {{as far as the}} mental element is concerned. Likewise, in the same paper Baker argued that all complicity required factual assistance or encouragement and that joint enterprises were just another way of encouraging and thus there was no separate form of complicity based on mere association and foresight. Other academics took the view that joint enterprise was a separate form of complicity with recklessness as its mental element, but attacked the policy injustice of such an approach.
