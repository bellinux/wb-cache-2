In 1937, the company built a new building on the north edge of town. In that same year, the manager of the company, Lester R. Peel, started production of ergot. Local farmers were discarding rye that was infected with sclerotia growths, because the ergot could cause deadly poisoning. Peel, a former school teacher, understood that the ergot also had medical applications, such as controlling postpartum bleeding and treating vasoconstriction, hypertension, vascular headaches, and migraines.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To review {{scientific}} {{sources on}} the use of <b>feed</b> <b>yeast</b> preparations in feeding of sturgeon species (Acipenserinae). Findings. The review of scientific works demonstrated that <b>feed</b> <b>yeast</b> in the feeding of sturgeons have been used as a source of vitamins and complete protein, the nutritional value of which is significantly higher than in the proteins of plant origin and are similar to the proteins of animal origin. In addition, a unit of yeast protein mass is significantly lower than in the feeds of animal origin. Moreover, based on the content of B group vitamins, <b>feed</b> <b>yeast</b> produced from the grain-potato spent wash exceed fish meal and meat-and-bone meal. The article highlights the peculiarities of the technological process of the production of different <b>feed</b> <b>yeast</b> species, amino acid and fatty acid composition of their preparations, basic physical and chemical parameters of their composition. The examples of <b>feed</b> <b>yeast</b> formulas for sturgeon species based on <b>feed</b> <b>yeast</b> preparations are presented. It was shown that sturgeon species, especially on early stages of their ontogenesis, could effectively use the <b>feed</b> <b>yeast</b> nucleotides. Thus, the latters can be an effective substitute of live zooplanktonic organisms. While the production of some <b>feed</b> <b>yeast</b> preparations (paprin, eprin) was stopped in 1990 s due to a number of social-economic reasons, the works on the creation of their full analogues was continued later. Currently, the trends of the development of world aquaculture anticipates the return to the use of yeast in fish feeding. Therefore, the interest of the agrarians of Ukraine in yeast lately increased and their use in agricultural sector increased by 2 - 2. 5 times. Practical value. The array of the summarized information will be important for scientists who study the peculiarities of feeding of sturgeon species, because the data about the use of yeast as sources of complete protein in fish feeds is important in a constant search for the most effective components of their ration...|$|E

40|$|This profile {{provides}} a brief {{introduction to the}} yeast production industry with particular emphasis on the production of baker's yeast. Yeast can be obtained either as the primary product of a process, {{as in the case}} of baker's yeast, or as a secondary or by-product from alcoholic fermentations. Secondary yeast is usually preferred to primary yeast for use as animal feed for reasons of economy. Carbohydrates in the form of molasses or hydrolysed starches are the most commonly used substrates for yeast growth. Carbohydrate-containing waste streams from other processes and n-paraffins from oil have also been exploited for the production of <b>feed</b> <b>yeast.</b> Processes for the production of primary yeast vary but basically consist of materials preparation, seed yeast production, fermentation, yeast separation and pressing or drying steps, depending on the type of yeast required. About half a million tonnes are thought to be produced annually, slightly under half as baker's yeast. The size of plant can vary from half a tonne per day upwards. Plants have been built for n-paraffin <b>feed</b> <b>yeast</b> with capacities of 100, 000 tonnes per year. The cost of a basic plant to produce 7. 5 tonnes of active dried baker's yeast (10 % moisture) per day would be about £ 3. 5 million f. o. b. UK in July 1980. Additional plant, necessary in many locations, would increase the cost. Yeast plants are not labour intensive; this scale of operation would provide 21 - 24 jobs.

On the other hand, treating wastewater with yeast is also considered an attractive way to produce yeast biomass resource. For example, cheese whey was used to produce a food yeast, Kluyveromyces fragilis (Paul et al. 2002). Yeast biomass productivities of Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces marxianus, and Pichia stipitis were investigated using brewery’s spent grains hemicellulosic hydrolyzates (Duartc et al. 2008). A <b>feed</b> <b>yeast</b> Candida utilis was used to produce biomass from salad oil manufacturing wastewater (Zheng et al. 2005).

Despite its high nutrient content, SW is highly perishable, which limits its utilization for animal feed and fertilizer. Therefore, SW is mainly treated by methane fermentation. On the other hand, a <b>feed</b> <b>yeast,</b> Candida utilis, can utilize various organic compounds and be utilized as a yeast extract source and animal feed.

Many citrus fruits are generally eaten fresh. Oranges and grapefruit juices are popular breakfast beverages, but more astringent citrus such as lemons and limes are used for garnishing or in cooked dishes. Citrus fruits are also made use of in production of squashes, citrus fruit powders, marmalade and other flavouring agents. After the extraction of the juice from the fruit, the resulting fruit pulp is a possible livestock feed and the rind oil is an expensive commodity in the international market.

40|$|Abstract: Succinic acid was {{produced}} by fermentation of Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens using glycerol as a carbon source. When cells were anaerobically cultured in a medium containing 6. 5 g/L glycerol, a high succinic acid yield (133 %) was obtained while avoiding the for-mation of by-product acetic acid. The gram ratio of suc-cinic acid to acetic acid was 25. 8 : 1, which is 6. 5 times higher than that obtained using glucose (ca. 4 : 1) as a carbon source. Therefore, succinic acid can be produced with much less by-product formation by using glycerol as a carbon source, which will facilitate its purification. When glucose and glycerol were cofermented with the increasing ratio of glucose to glycerol, the gram ratio of succinic acid to acetic acid and succinic acid yield de-creased, suggesting that glucose enhanced acetic acid formation irrespective {{of the presence of}} glycerol. Glyc-erol consumption by A. succiniciproducens required un-identified nutritional components present in yeast ex-tract.

40|$|Livestock {{have been}} fed yeast as a feed {{supplement}} {{for more than}} 100 years Stone, C. 00). Yeast is a microscopic, single cell fungi of the plant kingdom. Of the 50, 000 species of fungi, only 60 different genera of yeast representing about 500 different species exist. A few of these are used commercially in the animal feed industry as active dry yeast or yeast culture (Kreger, van Rij, 1984). Yeast culture consists of live yeast cells, plus the medium on which yeast is grown. Yeast products are commonly fed as pro-biotics, but {{little is known about}} their effects. Some studies have reported that yeast products increased milk yield and milk fat percentage; however, other studies found that yeast products had no effect on any of these factors (Middelveld. H 1998). A three phase trial, starting August 2003 and ending February 2005, was conducted at the Western Kentucky University Agricultural Research and Education Complex (Dairy facilities), in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Trial 1 evaluated the affect of dietary yeast, (WY) a, fed to cows in early lactation during heat stress conditions. Trial 2 evaluated the effect of dietary yeast WY fed to pre and post-partum cows during weather stress conditions. Trial 3 evaluated milk yield of cows fed post-partum cows 2 different types of yeast, (CC 5) b or (YS) C, versus a no yeast control group (CG) d, during weather stress conditions to post-partum cows. Cows in trials 1 and 2 were fed a total mixed ration (TMRs) consisting of corn silage, alfalfa hay and haylage, grain mix, whole cottonseed and controlled access to alfalfa pasture; while the third trial cows received a TMR of corn silage, alfalfa hay, whole cottonseed and grain mix. In all trials, milk weights were captured and recorded at each milking using electronic weigh meters, which download into a computer. Seven day average milk weights were used for the analysis in all the trials. Data were analyzed using SPSS 13 and Microsoft Excel XP 2006, standard statistical analysis software. In trial one milk yield and energy corrected milk (ECM) were statistically higher (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in the Holstein WY group. The limited Jersey sample size did not provide adequate statistical data for analysis. In the second trial, milk yield and ECM were statistically higher in the Jerseys in trial WY versus the Jerseys in the CG group. There was no significant statistical difference in Holsteins treated WY versus the Holsteins in the CG group. In the third trial, ECM was statistically significant at (p= 0. 05) in the CC 5 groups versus the CG group. The CC 5 group differed from YS group at the (p= 0. 05) level in the Holstein groups {{as well as in the}} Jersey groups.

Thus, easy-setup closed-system experiments are also useful for investigations of central metabolism dynamics of yeast cells.

Two treatment diets contained (DM basis) 70. 0 % of forage, 21. 8 % of concentrates and 8. 2 % of either ordinary rice (control) or red yeast rice (RYR). Nutrient utilization was measured and enteric methane emissions were determined in respiration chambers. Results showed that RYR had significantly lower digestibility of N and organic matter compared to control group. However, <b>feeding</b> red <b>yeast</b> rice did not affect N retention as g/d or a proportion of N intake, and reduced heat production as MJ/d or as a proportion of metabolizable energy intake, thus leading to a higher proportion of metabolizable energy intake to be retained in body tissue. RYR also had significantly lower methane emissions either as g/d, or as a proportion of feed intake. Although <b>feeding</b> red <b>yeast</b> rice had no negative effect on any rumen fermentation variables, it decreased serum contents of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. In the present study, 75616 archaeal sequences were generated and clustered into 2364 Operational Taxonomic Units. At the genus level, the predominant archaea in the rumen of goats was Methanobrevibacter, which was significantly inhibited with the supplementation of red yeast rice. In conclusion, red yeast rice is a potential feed ingredient for mitigation of enteric methane emissions of goats.

While achieving the purpose of the study nutritional value of the yeast was established (quantity of protein, fat, calcium, phosphorus, organic substance, fat acids). The data of the study show that yeast has a relatively high protein level from 42, 44 to 46, 79 %. Quantity of crude fat varied from 5, 30 to 6, 50 %. Analysis of mineral materials indicated calcium amount of 2, 11 - 2, 24 % and phosphorus amount of 0, 80 - 0, 88 %. Linoleic acid and linolenic acid made 60, 32 - 60, 81 % and 3, 80 - 4, 17 % respectively, of all fat acids. The main amino acids compiled 0, 22 - 0, 27 % of lyzine, 0, 49 - 0, 55 % of metionine, 0, 56 - 0, 62 % of treonine.

Data of the sensory evaluation show that in presence of more than 6 % of yeast, broiler breast muscles were of a sour taste. While assessing other parameters (overall odour intensity, boiled chicken odour, non typical odour, tenderness, chewiness, juiciness, fibriness, mouthfeel, boiled chicken taste, non typical taste, aftertaste) no significant differences between the experimental and control groups were found. Addition of 5 % of yeast is recommended for chicken broilers’ food rations...|$|R
40|$|Yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{containing}} in 1 kg of dry product, separately 32. 0 g Fe (Y-Fe), 23. 0 g Cu (Y-Cu), 35. 4 g Mn (Y-Mn), {{were used}} {{as the source of}} these microelements in complete diet for growing pigs. If considering livestock requirements, feed supplementation with this organic form of microelements, covered animals requirements in: Fe- 27 %, Cu- 75 %, Mn- 30 %. ZnO was the source of zinc. The experiments were carried out on 25 barrows. Digestibility of the main nutrients, the apparent absorption and balance for Fe, Cu, Mn as well as Zn, Ca, P, Mg, were carried out. The supplemented microelements did not have the adverse effect on digestibility of the main nutrients and the apparent absorption of Ca, P and Mg. Barrows fed with feed containing Y-Fe excreted more iron with urine than the control, which statistically significantly (P< 0. 05) influenced decrease of retention from 67. 4 to 58. 0 %. Absorption was similar in both groups. The supplementation of Y-Cu had the influence on increase of retention of Cu up to 25. 6 % and absorption up to 28. 1 % when compared with the control group (21. 3 and 23. 7 %), respectively. Supplementation of Y-Mn also significantly (P< 0. 05) increased Mn retention up to 20. 1 % and absorption up to 21. 4 % when compared with the control group (12. 8 and 13. 8 %, respectively). Joint supplementation of Y-Fe, Y-Cu and Y-Mn did not improve retention and absorption of all the microelements. In the group Y-Cu, significant (P< 0. 05) decrease of retention and absorption of Zn was observed when compared with the remaining groups. It was found that in pigs <b>feeding,</b> <b>yeasts</b> enriched with copper and manganese may find application in practice. However, yeasts enriched with iron, were found to be less efficient than inorganic form of this bioelement...|$|R
25|$|Yeast {{is added}} to the wort in a large vessel (often tens of {{thousands}} of litres) called a washback. Washbacks are commonly made of Oregon Pine or stainless steel. The <b>yeast</b> <b>feeds</b> on the sugars, and as a by-product, produces both carbon dioxide and alcohol. This process is called fermentation and can take up to three days to complete. When complete, the liquid has an alcohol content of 5 to 7% by volume, and is now known as wash. Up until this point the process has been quite similar to the production of beer.|$|R
40|$|Yeast cells produce various {{volatile}} metabolites {{that are}} key {{contributors to the}} pleasing fruity and flowery aroma of fermented beverages. Several of these fruity metabolites, including isoamyl acetate and ethyl acetate, are produced by a dedicated enzyme, the alcohol acetyl transferase Atf 1. However, despite much research, the physiological role of acetate ester formation in yeast remains unknown. Using a combination of molecular biology, neurobiology, and behavioral tests, we demonstrate that deletion of ATF 1 alters the olfactory response in the antennal lobe of fruit flies that <b>feed</b> on <b>yeast</b> cells. The flies are much less attracted to the mutant yeast cells, and this in turn results in reduced dispersal of the mutant yeast cells by the flies. Together, our results uncover the molecular details of an intriguing aroma-based communication and mutualism between microbes and their insect vectors. Similar mechanisms may exist in other microbes, including microbes on flowering plants and pathogens. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Selenium (Se) is an {{essential}} trace mineral required for growth, development, immune function, and metabolism. Selenium exerts its biological effects as an integral component of selenoproteins (SePs). Deficiency or low Se status leads to marked changes in many biochemical pathways {{and a range of}} pathologies and disorders which are associated with SeP function. Animals, and presumably humans, are able to efficiently utilize nutritionally adequate levels of Se in both organic and inorganic forms. It is now clear that the bioavailability of Se varies depending on the source and chemical form of the Se supplement. There are a range of products available for dietary Se supplementation, however, organic sources {{have been shown to be}} assimilated more efficiently than inorganic compounds and are considered to be less toxic and more appropriate as a <b>feed</b> supplement. <b>Yeast</b> enriched with Selenohomoalanthionine (SeHLan) has recently become commercially available, and initial research suggests that it may be an efficacious source for the production of Se enriched animal products...|$|R
50|$|They feed on {{microorganisms}} {{that live}} in any type of dead plant material. They contribute to the decomposition of dead vegetation, and <b>feed</b> on bacteria, <b>yeasts,</b> and fungi. For this reason, slime molds are usually found in soil, lawns, and on the forest floor, commonly on deciduous logs. However, in tropical areas they are also common on inflorescences, fruits and in aerial situations (e.g., in the canopy of trees). In urban areas, they are found on mulch {{or even in the}} leaf mold in gutters, and also grow in air conditioners, especially when the drain is blocked.|$|R
40|$|The {{adjustment}} of feeding behavior {{in response to}} hunger and satiety contributes to homeostatic regulation in animals. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster <b>feeds</b> on <b>yeasts</b> growing on overripe fruit, providing nutrients required for adult survival, reproduction and larval growth. Here, we present data on how the nutritional value of food affects subsequent yeast consumption in Drosophila adult males. After a period of starvation, flies showed intensive yeast consumption. In comparison, flies stopped feeding after having access to a nutritive cornmeal diet. Interestingly, dietary glucose was equally efficient as the complex cornmeal diet. In contrast, flies fed with sucralose, a non-metabolizable sweetener, behaved {{as if they were}} starved. The adipokinetic hormone and insulin-like peptides regulate metabolic processes in insects. We did not find any effect of the adipokinetic hormone pathway on this modulation. Instead, the insulin pathway was involved in these changes. Flies lacking the insulin receptor (InR) did not respond to nutrient deprivation by increasing yeast consumption. Together these results show the importance of insulin in the regulation of yeast consumption in response to starvation in adult D. melanogaster males...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the accumulation of}} copper (Cu) by the springtail Folsomia candida Willem, if exposed to Cu-contaminated sandy soil with yeast as a food source. Commonly, the dissolved and the easily desorbed Cu fractions {{are assumed to be}} available for uptake, and as both fractions depend on pH, a pH dependency of copper uptake and accumulation is expected. In recent studies with springtails this dependency was not observed. To explain this, we show that both the adsorption of copper by yeast and by soil is indeed pH dependent; however, these dependencies differ. Addition of yeast as a food source to copper-contaminated soil leads to competition for copper by yeast and soil that suppresses the pH dependency of copper adsorption by yeast. This may cause a pH dependency not to be observed in copper accumulation by springtails if they predominantly <b>feed</b> on <b>yeast</b> in bioassays. We conclude that the addition of artificial food sources in bioassays may affect the cause-effect relationships that are investigated. A combination of (soil) chemical experimentation and modeling and ecotoxicological studies may help in identifying such bias and, therefore, with interpreting bioassays...|$|R
