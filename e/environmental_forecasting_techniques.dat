40|$|This {{paper is}} {{designed}} to set the scene in terms of introducing the methodological framework used in the academic “think tank” in marketing held at Lake of Menteith in Scotland in 1999. Some important academic insights and considerations are discussed at the outset {{with regard to the}} evaluation of future impacts on the multiple facets of the marketing discipline, although the amount and quality of dedicated academic research in this area has been limited. The new role of the marketing function and new customer market structures are debated, followed by a discussion of the intrinsic capabilities of scenario planning, as an <b>environmental</b> <b>forecasting</b> <b>technique.</b> Furthermore, we analyse the contribution of knowledge based systems to scenario planning and describe the design/development of an expert system at the Lake of Menteith gathering...|$|R
40|$|The "accepted " {{cause of}} clear air {{turbulence}} that plagues aircraft when flying at high altitudes is Kelvin-Helmholtz instability caused by wind shear. However, environmental Richardson numbers associated with air-craft turbulence reports are too high {{to assume that the}} turbulence is caused just by the <b>environmental</b> wind shear. <b>Forecast</b> <b>techniques</b> developed to date have assumed that there are layers of local Richardson number favorable for turbulence within the larger layer for which it was measured. The forecasts are probabilistic {{in the sense that the}} lower the environmental Richardson num-ber, the more likely somewhere in the layer there will be turbulence. Theory and observations demonstrate that gravity waves can locally modify the wind shear and sta-bility so as to produce turbulence. Analysis of model out-put associated with {{clear air turbulence}} events suggests that turbulence and indicators of large-scale atmospheric imbalance are related. Since highly unbalanced flow must undergo geostrophic adjustment which is a known cause of gravity waves, clear air turbulence may be caused by gravity waves. The conclusion, while preliminary, is that better clear air turbulence forecasts will likely come from an ingredients-based technique that includes both environmental wind shear and gravity wave forcing. 1...|$|R

40|$|Imperviousness has {{increased}} due to urbanization, {{as has the}} frequency of extreme rainfall events by climate change. Various countermeasures, such as structural and nonstructural measures, are required to prepare for these effects. Flood forecasting is a representative nonstructural measure. Flood <b>forecasting</b> <b>techniques</b> {{have been developed for}} the prevention of repetitive flood damage in urban areas. It is difficult to apply some flood <b>forecasting</b> <b>techniques</b> using training processes because training needs to be applied at every usage. The other flood <b>forecasting</b> <b>techniques</b> that use rainfall data predicted by radar are not appropriate for small areas, such as single drainage basins. In this study, a new flood <b>forecasting</b> <b>technique</b> is suggested to reduce flood damage in urban areas. The flood nomograph consists of the first flooding nodes in rainfall runoff simulations with synthetic rainfall data at each duration. When selecting the first flooding node, the initial amount of synthetic rainfall is 1 mm, which increases in 1 mm increments until flooding occurs. The advantage of this flood <b>forecasting</b> <b>technique</b> is its simple application using real-time rainfall data. This technique can be used to prepare a preemptive response in the process of urban flood management...|$|R

40|$|Demand {{functions}} for goods are generally cyclical in nature with {{characteristics such as}} trend or stochasticity. Most existing demand <b>forecasting</b> <b>techniques</b> in literature are designed to manage and forecast this type of demand functions. However, if the demand function is lumpy in nature, then the general demand <b>forecasting</b> <b>techniques</b> may fail given the unusual characteristics of the function. Proper identification of the underlying demand function and using the most appropriate <b>forecasting</b> <b>technique</b> becomes critical. In this paper, we will attempt to explore the key characteristics of {{the different types of}} demand function and relate them to known statistical distributions. By fitting statistical distributions to actual past demand data, we are then able to identify the correct demand functions, so that the most appropriate <b>forecasting</b> <b>technique</b> can be applied to obtain improved forecasting results. We applied the methodology to a real case study to show the reduction in forecasting errors obtained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Forecasting is an {{important}} issue for many different applications. In this paper, a new efficient <b>forecasting</b> <b>technique</b> is presented. Such technique is designed by using fast neural networks (FNNs). The new idea relies on performing cross correlation in the frequency domain between the input data and the input weights of neural networks. It is proved mathematically and practically that the number of computation steps required for the proposed fast <b>forecasting</b> <b>technique</b> is less than that needed by conventional neural-based forecasting. Simulation results using MATLAB confirm the theoretical computations. The proposed fast <b>forecasting</b> <b>technique</b> increases the prediction speed {{and at the same time}} does not affect the predication accuracy.

40|$|Managing {{uncertainty}} {{when the}} demand is irregular and sporadic (i. e. "lumpy") is a complex issue {{as well as an}} unexplored one. This study analyses the behaviour of <b>forecasting</b> <b>techniques</b> when dealing with lumpy demand at the master production scheduling level. In particular, three <b>forecasting</b> <b>techniques</b> (exponentially weighted moving average, early sales and order overplanning) are considered. It is argued that demand lumpiness is a multidimensional phenomenon, generated by different market characteristics, namely, numerousness of customers, heterogeneity of customers, frequency of order placing, variety of each customer's request and correlation between customers behaviour. Hence, the performances of the three forecasting methods are compared, through simulation experiments, with different values of the sources of lumpiness. A framework is then proposed that indicates the domain of applicability of each <b>forecasting</b> <b>technique</b> according to the prevailing source of lumpiness in the market...|$|R

Various <b>forecasting</b> <b>techniques</b> have been developed and applied to the tourism context, amongst which econometric forecasting has been winning an increasing popularity in tourism research. This paper therefore aims to introduce the latest developments of econometric forecasting approaches and their applications to tourism demand analysis. Particular emphases are placed on the time varying parameter (TVP) <b>forecasting</b> <b>technique</b> and its application to the almost ideal demand system (AIDS). The discussions in this paper fall into two main parts, in line with the two broad categories of econometric forecasting approaches: the first part refers to the single-equation <b>forecasting</b> <b>techniques,</b> focusing particularly on both long-run and short-term TVP models. The second part introduces the system-of-equations forecasting models, represented by the AIDS and its dynamic versions including the combination with the TVP technique, will be discussed one by one following the order of methodological developments. </p...|$|R

Compared to consumer firms, industrial firms appear to have longer forecast time horizons and rely more on the sales force for new product forecasting. Additional analyses show that there {{does not appear to be}} a general relationship between a particular department’s involvement and higher forecast accuracy or greater satisfaction, nor does it appear that use of a particular technique relates to higher forecast accuracy and greater satisfaction. Countering previous research findings, the number of <b>forecasting</b> <b>techniques</b> employed also does not appear to correlate to higher forecasting accuracy or greater satisfaction.
