5|$|The film marked {{something}} of an {{end of an era}} for its creator. The director himself recognized this {{at the time of its}} release, telling critic Donald Richie that a cycle of some kind had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> an end and that his future films and production methods would be different. His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.|$|E
25|$|In 1799, after {{a series}} of naval battles with the French (known as the Quasi-War), {{full-scale}} war seemed inevitable. In this crisis, Adams broke with his party and sent three new commissioners to France. Napoleon, who had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> power, received them cordially, and the danger of conflict subsided with the negotiation of the Convention of 1800, which formally released the United States from its 1778 wartime alliance with France. However, reflecting American weakness, France refused to pay $20 million in compensation for American ships seized by the French navy.|$|E

[...] The following week Wright proposed the idea to Martin Luther King Jr., who subsequently organized the Poor People's March on Washington.

For ATLiens, the band aimed for a consistent set of songs {{in which a}} listener would not need to skip tracks; OutKast wrote around 35 songs for the album and reduced them to fourteen. The duo's songwriting style for the album had no solid structure and was mostly spontaneous; Big Boi noted, [...] "Stuff'll <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you.

[...] "Or Mirwais will send me over music – rough stuff that doesn't have an arrangement: basic chord progressions. 'American Life' itself came about like that." [...] In April 2003, Madonna discussed her motivations behind [...] "American Life" [...] with VH1 while talking about her experience in the music industry. She stated [...] "I {{look back at the}} 20 years behind me and I realized that {{a lot of things that}} I'd valued weren't important", in response to the non-materialistic themes of the record.

500|$|In 1833, as he {{revealed}} {{in a letter}} to his sister, Balzac entered into an illicit affair with fellow writer Maria Du Fresnay, who was then aged 24. Her marriage to a considerably older man (Charles du Fresnay, Mayor of Sartrouville) had been a failure from the outset. In this letter, Balzac also reveals that the young woman had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> tell him she was pregnant with his child. In 1834, 8 months after the event, Maria Du Fresnay's daughter by Balzac, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay, was born. This revelation from French journalist [...] in 1955 confirmed what was already suspected by several historians: the dedicatee of the novel Eugénie Grandet, a certain [...] "Maria", turns out to be Maria Du Fresnay herself.|$|E

She also arranged with King Features Syndicate, another Hearst agency, to return to Russia to write portraits of Russians. The first of these appeared in print in June 1922 and led to her second book, Mirrors of Moscow, in 1923. Bryant's travels in Europe this time included Moscow, Berlin, London, Paris, and other cities. By late October, she was in Rome, accompanied by Bullitt. Here in late 1922, she wrote about Benito Mussolini, the Fascist leader who had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> power and {{with whom she had}} obtained an interview. Gathering material from a variety of sources, including Madame Rachele Mussolini, Bryant wrote a feature article, [...] "Mussolini Relies Upon Efficiency to Restore Italy", published in the New York American in early 1923.

On April 5, 2014, Kane was a healthy scratch under new head coach Paul Maurice, {{in a game against}} the Toronto Maple Leafs. After the game, Maurice said it was a coach's decision, and that if Kane wanted back in the lineup, all he needed to do was [...] "probably <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the rink." [...] On February 3, 2015 Kane was a healthy scratch against the Vancouver Canucks. It was later determined that he was scratched because of an incident with his teammates. Kane revealed in an October 2015 interview that he felt the Jets did not [...] "have his back" [...] throughout his legal and behavioral issues but instead felt that they traded away their problem. On August 1, Kane plead not guilty to charges alleging he grabbed three women during an altercation at a downtown Buffalo bar in June 2016.|$|E

500|$|... "Witch Doctor" [...] {{is based}} on a true story where Tinie met a girl at a show who he took with him on the tour bus and showed what it's like to live his life. [...] "It's OK" [...] and [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] are two songs that feature vocals and {{production}} from Labrinth. [...] "It's OK" [...] is a contrast from the [...] "intro and fun, random bouncy things" [...] according to Okogwu. He added [...] "it's very unorthodox in the sense that people wouldn't have heard or even expect us to make a song like this because it's very slow and ballad-y. It's very reminiscent to me of the Fugees or something because it just sounds different and very soulful as well." [...] He wrote the song in Jamaica and wanted it to feel rustic and urban. Tinie wanted to [...] "push the envelope" [...] with what you're used to hearing from him and Labrinth. [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] is a feel-good, radio-friendly song that incorporates hip hop and electronic music, along with rap rock, and is about good vibes and [...] "doing your thing". [...] "I'm a lover, not a fighter. I've <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> do my thing and enjoy myself so don't try and get on to me about it or try and make me feel bad about everything that's going on in my life", said Tinie to SB.TV.|$|E

2500|$|The Sibebe Survivor walk is a 10km {{walk that}} starts from Mbuluzi High School, where {{participants}} can park their cars. Hikers climb the rock {{in an average}} time of 3 or 4 hours.

[...] The funds raised by the event are used to finance Rotary Foundation projects such as the distribution of wheelchairs and support for government hospitals. There is no cash reward for the winner of the race. The number of participants has gradually increased since the event was first held in July 2004.

[...] Abu Bakr continued, [...] "I said to 'Umar, 'How can we embark on what the Prophet never did?' 'Umar replied that it was a good deed regardless, and he did not cease replying to my scruples until Allah reconciled me to the undertaking, and I became of the same mind as him.
