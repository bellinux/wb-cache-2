40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} on the functional {{properties of the}} intestinal oligopeptide transporter PepT 1 from rabbit have been investigated using electrophysiological methods. The dipeptide Gly-Gln at pH 6. 5 or 7. 5 was used as substrate. Raising {{the temperature in the}} range 20 - 30 °C causes an increase in the maximal transport-associated current (I (max)) with a Q (10) close to 4. Higher temperatures accelerate the rate of decline of the presteady-state currents observed in the absence of organic substrate. The voltage dependencies of the intramembrane charge movement and of the time constant of decline are both shifted towards more negative potentials by higher temperatures. The shift is due to a stronger action of temperature on the outward rate of charge movement compared to the <b>inward</b> <b>rate,</b> indicating a lower activation energy for the latter process. Consistently, the activation energy for the complete cycle {{is similar to that of}} the <b>inward</b> <b>rate</b> of charge movement. Temperature also affects the binding rate of the substrate: the K (0. 5) -V curve is shifted to more negative potentials by higher temperatures, resulting in a lower apparent affinity in the physiological range of potentials. The overall efficiency of transport, estimated as the I (max) /K (0. 5) ratio is significantly increased at body temperature...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{temperature}} on the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake {{and on the}} presteady-state and transport-associated currents of the GABA cotransporter, rat γ-aminobutyric acid transporter 1 (rGAT 1), have been studied using heterologous oocyte expression and voltage-clamp. Increasing temperature from 15 to 30 °C increased GABA uptake, diminished the maximal value of the relaxation time constant of the presteady-state currents and increased the amplitude of the current associated with the transport of GABA. The curve of the presteady-state charge versus voltage was shifted toward negative potentials by increasing the temperature, while the maximal amount of charge (Qmax) remained constant; the τ versus V curve was also negatively shifted by increasing temperatures. Analysis of the outward (α) and <b>inward</b> (β) <b>rate</b> constants as functions of temperature showed that they are affected differently, with a Q 10 = 3. 4 for α and Q 10 = 1. 5 for β. The different temperature coefficients of the rate constants account for the observed shifts. These observations are consistent with a charge moving mechanism based on a conformational change of the protein; the weaker temperature sensitivity of the <b>inward</b> <b>rate</b> constant suggests a rate-limiting diffusional component on this process...|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} radial migration {{rates of}} protoplanets in laminar minimum mass solar nebula discs using three-dimensional self-gravitating radiation hydrodynamical (RHD) models. The protoplanets {{are free to}} migrate, whereupon their migration rates are measured. For low mass protoplanets (10 - 50 M_⊕) we find increases in the migration timescales of up to {{an order of magnitude}} between locally-isothermal and RHD models. In the high-mass regime the migration rates are changed very little. These results are arrived at by calculating migration rates in locally-isothermal models, before sequentially introducing self-gravity, and radiative transfer, allowing us to isolate the effects of the additional physics. We find that using a locally-isothermal equation of state, without self-gravity, we reproduce the migration rates obtained by previous analytic and numerical models. We explore the impact of different protoplanet models, and changes to their assumed radii, upon migration. The introduction of self-gravity gives a slight reduction of the migration rates, whilst the inertial mass problem, which has been proposed for high mass protoplanets with circumplanetary discs, is reproduced. Upon introducing radiative transfer to models of low mass protoplanets (≈ 10 M_⊕), modelled as small radius accreting point masses, we find outward migration with a rate of approximately twice the analytic <b>inward</b> <b>rate.</b> However, when modelling such a protoplanet in a more realistic manner, with a surface which enables the formation of a deep envelope, this outward migration is not seen.

40|$|ABSTRACT Membrane {{potential}} {{and the rate}} constants for anion self-exchange in dog, cat, and human red blood cells {{have been shown to}} vary with cell volume. For dog and cat red cells, the outward rate constants for SO 4 and CI increase while the <b>inward</b> <b>rate</b> constant for SO 4 decreases as cells swell or shrink. These changes coincide with the membrane potential becoming more negative as a result of changes in cell volume. Human red cells exhibit a similar change in the rate constants for SO 4 and CI ettlux in response to cell swelling, but shrunken cells exhibit a decreased rate constant for SO 4 efflux and a more positive membrane potential. Hyperpolarization of shrunken dog and cat red cells is due to a volume-dependent increase in PN,. If this increase in PNa is prevented by ATP depletion or if the outward Na gradient is removed, the response to shrinking is identical to human red cells. These results suggest that the volume dependence of anion permeability may be secondary to changes in the anion equilibrium ratio which in red cells is reflected by the membrane potential. When the membrane {{potential and}} cell volume of human red cells were varied independently by a method involving pretreatment with nystatin, {{it was found that the}} rate of anion transport (for SO 4 and CI) does not vary with cell volume but rather with membrane potential (anion equilibrium ratio); that is, the rate constant for anion efllux is decreased and that for influx is increased as the membrane potential becomes more positive (internal anion concentration increases) while the opposite is true with membrane hyperpolarization (a fall in internal anion concentration) ...|$|R

The sodium flux in such cells at 37 °C. was 6. 0 ± 1. 5 m. eq. / (liters RBC) x (hours). When S-S cells were sickled by incubation in N 2, sodium outflux increased two- to threefold, while influx increased four- to fivefold and the cells gained net sodium. A small but undetermined fraction of the sodium in disk and sickle shaped S-S cells exchanges at one or more rates which are substantially slower than those calculated here from the initial rate of transfer of tracer from cells to the medium. The penetration of tracer Cs into normal and both disk and sickled S-S cells was markedly inhibited by increasing the K concentration in the medium, indicating that Cs and K compete for an entrance pathway in all three cell types. The ratio of the <b>inward</b> <b>rate</b> constant for tracer Cs to that for K 42 in normal and disk-shaped S-S cells increased only slightly when the K concentration in the medium was increased, indicating that almost all the Cs entered such cells in competition with K. Sickling accelerated the entrance of tracer cesium into S-S cells. Furthermore, the rate constant ratio increased with increasing external K concentration in sickled cells, suggesting the simultaneous presence of a non-competitive route for cesium influx in this cell type. The results are interpreted to {{support the view that}} sickling (a) accelerates inward transport of K and Cs and outward transport of Na by a non-diffusion, assumed carrier, process and (b) opens pathways for the diffusion of all three ions...|$|R

40|$|By {{surveying}} new {{fields for}} the shortest-period "big" planets, the Kepler spacecraft {{could provide the}} statistics to more clearly measure the occurrence distributions of giant and medium planets. This would allow separate determinations for giant and medium planets {{of the relationship between}} the <b>inward</b> <b>rate</b> of tidal migration of planets and the strength of the stellar tidal dissipation (as expressed by the tidal quality factor Q). We propose a "Hot Big Planets Survey" to find new big planets to better determine the planet occurrence distribution at the shortest period. We call planets that Kepler will be able to find as "big", for the purpose of comparing the distribution of giant and medium planets (above and below 8 earth radii). The distribution of planets from one field has been interpreted to show that the shortest period giant planets are at the end of an ongoing flow of high eccentricity migration, likely from scattering from further out. The numbers of planets at these short periods is still small, leaving uncertainty over the result that the distribution shows the expected power index for inward tidal migration. The current statistics make it hard to say whether the presence of more giant planets at the shortest periods despite there being more medium planets at most periods indicates a greater migration of giant than medium planets. We propose a repurposed Kepler mission to make enough 45 -day observations to survey 10 times as many stars as in the survey of the original field, to survey for planets with periods of up to fifteen days with at least three transits.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{mutation}} K 448 E in the rat GABA transporter rGAT 1 was studied using heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes and voltage clamp. At neutral pH, the transport-associated current vs. voltage (I–V) relationship of the mutated transporter was different from wild-type, and the pre-steady-state currents were shifted towards more positive potentials. The mutated transporter showed an increased apparent affinity for Na+ (e. g. 62 vs. 152 mm at − 60 mV), while the opposite was true for GABA (e. g. 20 vs. 13 μm at − 60 mV). In both isoforms changes in [Na+]o shifted the voltage dependence of the pre-steady-state and of the transport-associated currents by similar amounts. In the K 448 E form, the moved charge and the relaxation time constant were shifted by increasing pH towards positive potentials. The transport-associated current of the mutated transporter was strongly reduced by alkalinization, while acidification slightly decreased and distorted {{the shape of the}} I–V curve. Accordingly, uptake of [3 H]GABA was strongly reduced in K 448 E at pH 9. 0. The GABA apparent affinity of the mutated transporter was reduced by alkalinization, while acidification had the opposite result. These observations suggest that protonation of negatively charged residues may regulate the Na+ concentration in the proximity of the transporter. Calculation of the unidirectional rate constants for charge movement shows that, in the K 448 E form, the <b>inward</b> <b>rate</b> constant is increased at alkaline pH, while the outward rate constant does not change, in agreement with an effect due to mass action law. A possible explanation for the complex effect of pH on the transport-associated current may be found by combining changes in local [Na+]o with a direct action of pH on GABA concentration or affinity.

Thus net glutamine release from muscle into circulation significantly decreased after rhGH administration (approximately 50 %), whereas glutamine synthetase mRNA levels increased after rhGH infusion, possibly to compensate for reduced glutamine precursor availability.

40|$|Planet {{migration}} is inherently a three-dimensional (3 D) problem, because Earth-size planetary cores are {{deeply embedded in}} protoplanetary disks. Simulations of these 3 D disks remain challenging due to the steep requirement in resolution. Using two different hydrodynamics code, FARGO 3 D and PEnGUIn, we simulate disk-planet interaction for a 1 to 5 Earth-mass planet embedded in an isentropic disk. We measure the torque on the planet and ensure that the measurements are converged both in resolution and between the two codes. We find that the torque is independent of the smoothing length of the planet's potential (r_ s), {{and that it has}} a weak dependence on the adiabatic index of the gaseous disk (γ). The torque values correspond to an <b>inward</b> migration <b>rate</b> qualitatively similar to previous linear calculations.

Methods and Results: An enriched anaerobic sludge effectively degrading over 99 % of dimethyl phthalate in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor for 530 days was characterized and quantified by 16 S rRNA-based molecular methods. A total of 78 Bacteria clones were classified into 22 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in nine divisions, including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Thermotogae, Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi, Spirochaetes, Acidobacteria and two candidate divisions. The two most abundant OTUs were likely responsible, respectively, for the de-esterification of DMP {{and the subsequent}} phthalate degradation. The outer layer of the granule was dominated by Bacteria; whereas the interior was by Archaea, of which 89 ± 5 % were acetoclastic Methanosaetaceae and 11 ± 5 % hydrogenotrophic Methanomicrobiales.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of planetesimals embedded in a circumbinary protoplanetary disk. A hybrid numerical approach is developed where {{the evolution of the}} gaseous component of the disk is computed with the hydrodynamical code FARGO while the planetesimal trajectories are computed with an N-body code. The local gas density and velocity derived from the hydrodynamical portion are used to calculate the drag force and the gravitational attraction of the disk on the planetesimals. We explore the effects of spiral density wave patterns and of the disk eccentricity, both excited by the binary tidal perturbations, on the dynamical evolution of planetesimal orbits. A new definition of osculating orbital elements is given to properly account for the gravitational attraction of the disk. The outcomes of the numerical simulations show that the pericenter alignment of the planetesimal orbits is a robust result. It occurs for different values of the binary eccentricity and surface density profiles of the disk. However, the pericenters are less collimated compared to early predictions based on codes adopting a stationary and axisymmetric approximation for the disk. In addition, the eccentricity values are higher and depend on the semimajor axis of the bodies. Both these effects favor higher relative velocities between colliding planetesimals, making accretion less likely than previously thought.

The current study {{examined the effects of}} insulin and/or exercise on glucose transport and phosphorylation in skeletal muscle and the influence of obesity on these processes. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Seven obese and 12 lean men underwent positron emission tomography with 2 -deoxy- 2 -[(18) F]fluoro-d-glucose in resting and isometrically exercising skeletal muscle during normoglycemic hyperinsulinemia. Data were analyzed by two-tissue compartmental modeling. Perfusion and oxidative capacity were measured during insulin stimulation by [15 O]H 2 O and [15 O]O 2. RESULTS: Exercise increased glucose fractional uptake (K), <b>inward</b> transport <b>rate</b> (K(1)), and the k(3) parameter, combining transport and intracellular phosphorylation, in lean and obese subjects. In each group, there was no statistically significant difference between plasma flow and K(1). At rest, a significant defect in K(1) (P = 0. 0016), k(3) (P = 0. 016), and K (P = 0. 022) was found in obese subjects. Exercise restored K(1), improved but did not normalize K (P = 0. 03 vs. lean), and did not ameliorate the more than 60 % relative impairment in k(3) in obese individuals (P = 0. 002 vs. lean). The glucose oxidative potential tended to be reduced by obesity. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The study indicates that exercise restores the impairment in insulin-mediated skeletal muscle perfusion and glucose delivery associated with obesity but does not normalize the defect involving the proximal steps regulating glucose disposal in obese individuals.

The predicted <b>inward</b> conductance <b>rate</b> of ∼ 27 ± 3 pS, agrees with experiment. The estimated outward conductance rate is 15 ± 3 pS, which is considerably lower. Comparing inward and outward flux, the mean ion dwell time in the selectivity filter (SF) is prolonged from 13. 5 ± 0. 6 ns to 20. 1 ± 1. 1 ns. Analysis of the Na+ distribution revealed distinct patterns for influx and efflux events. In 32. 0 ± 5. 9 % of the simulation time, the E 53 side chains adopted a flipped conformation during outward conduction, whereas this conformational change was rarely observed (2. 7 ± 0. 5 %) during influx. Further, simulations with dihedral restraints revealed that influx is less affected by the E 53 conformational flexibility. In contrast, during outward conduction, our simulations indicate that the flipped E 53 conformation provides direct coordination for Na+. The free energy profile (potential of mean force calculations) indicates that this conformational change lowers the putative barriers between sites SCEN and SHFS during outward conduction. We hypothesize that during an action potential, the increased Na+ outward transition propensities at depolarizing potentials might increase the probability of E 53 conformational changes in the SF.

40|$|In its Digital Single Market (DSM) strategy, the European Commission has rightly {{noted the}} {{importance}} of lowering the price paid for basic cross-border delivery by consumers and by small and medium size retail shippers. Consumers and SMEs may have few alternatives to the National Postal Operators (NPOs), or may be unaware of the options that they have. These concerns led to the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal in May 2016. 3 With its legislative proposal, the Commission has sought (1) to strengthen the data gathering powers of Member State postal regulatory authorities, and to oblige them to collect data at both retail and wholesale levels; (2) to increase transparency into pricing for those who use cross-border parcel delivery services; (3) to oblige Member State postal regulatory authorities to assess annually the affordability of these services; and (4) to open cross-border Terminal Dues (TD) and <b>Inward</b> Land <b>Rates</b> (ILR) arrangements to competitors There are parallels that can be drawn between the payment flows for cross-border parcel delivery and those of telecommunications, especially those of international mobile roaming. As with roaming, {{it is clear that}} the linkages between wholesale payments between and corresponding retail prices need to be properly understood in order to craft good policy. Another useful lesson is that Member State postal regulatory authorities are unlikely to address cross-border problems not only because of limitations in their respective mandates, but also because they have no incentive to take challenging measures to benefit residents of other countries. There are, however, also important differences between roaming versus parcel delivery. Where high wholesale charges were a major driver of high retail prices for international mobile roaming, the wholesale payments for cross-border parcel delivery appear instead to be below cost. This implies that it is the 2 ̆ 01 cspread 2 ̆ 01 d between retail price and the wholesale payment that is inflated, at least for small retail shippers and for consumers. Reviewing the Commission's proposed Regulation with all of this in mind, it appears to be on target.

However, so far this hypothesis {{has not yet been}} further explored. This study investigated the effect of endolithic algae on the growth performance of the cold-water coral Desmophyllum dianthus that is frequently associated with the endolithic chlorophyte Ostreobium queckettii and the cyanobacterium Plectonema terebrans. The fluorescent staining agent calcein was used to document the upward and inward linear growth of septa of specimens of D. dianthus at Fjord Comau, southern Chile. Further qualitative observations concerned skeletal microstructure and density using light field and fluorescence microscopy and x-ray computed tomography, respectively. Since the D. dianthus was sampled in a region displaying strong annual fluctuations of environmental parameters that might influence calcification, growth rates were also tested for a seasonal pattern. The results of this study show a severe reduction of growth rates associated with endolithic algae. Infested individuals grew about half as fast as non-infested polyps referring to both directions of septal growth with median values of 1. 18 μm/day for upward and 0. 49 μm/day for inward growth compared to 2. 76 μm/day and 0. 82 μm/day, respectively. These results point towards a parasitic relationship between D. dianthus and its endolithic algae refuting the hypothesis of a mutually beneficial association. This theory is further supported by observations on skeletal density and microstructure which suggest a reduction in skeletal density probably caused by extensive tunnelings of both endolithic species. Unlike expected the seasonal variation of upward septal growth rates of D. dianthus was inconsistent with the annual temperature pattern at Fjord Comau. Minimum growth rates were reported in periods of maximum temperatures – a phenomenon that might be explained by the trade-off between growth and reproduction which is suspected to take place in summer. <b>Inward</b> growth <b>rates</b> displayed a continuous decrease with time that is most likely attributed to the increasing influence of morphological constraints towards the center of the polyp. Although this study appears to conclusively indicate a negative effect of the association of D. dianthus with endolithic algae, controversial evidence has been discovered regarding metabolic links between the coral host and the endoliths and further research is necessary to fully resolve the issue...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{relatively}} few attempts to construct local housing market models in the United Kingdom—particularly models with an explicit treatment of land supply. In this paper we report {{the results of a}} pilot study designed to test the practicability of estimating a system of equations which describe housing market dynamics at the local level. Former district council areas in Central Scotland are used as a proxy for local housing markets within a region, thereby providing a panel dataset. A simple supply – demand system with separate equations for inward and outward household migration is modelled using two-stage least squares. The empirical results are varied, with some equations and coefficients performing more closely in line with prior expectations than others. House price levels are explained largely with reference to household income, socioeconomic status, and past levels of house price growth. Higher price levels and higher deprivation diminish inward migration. There are also suggestions in the results that higher rates of new-build supply partly cause higher <b>inward</b> migration. The <b>rate</b> of outward migration increases with ethnicity and wealth and decreases with deprivation. The empirical performance of the new-build supply equation is poor although the results do yield some interesting insights. House building output generally decreases as the proportion of ‘small’ sites in the land supply increases. There is also evidence that house building output decreases as land supply in neighbouring areas increases. We conclude the paper by outlining further directions for modelling prices, supply, and migration at local housing market level. In particular, the case is made for further work involving the collection of wider and longer panel datasets and for extending the pilot study work beyond Scotland. ...|$|R
40|$|Water {{resources}} {{in many parts}} of the world are subject to increasing stress because of (a) the growth in demand caused by population increase and economic development, (b) threats to supply caused by climate and land cover change, and (c) a heightened awareness of the importance of maintaining water supplies to other parts of the ecosystem. An additional factor is the quality of water management. The United States-Mexican border provides an example of poor water management combined with increasing demand for water resources that are both scarce and uncertain. This dissertation focuses on the problem of water management in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. The city has attracted foreign investment during the last few decades, largely due to relatively low environmental and labor costs, and to a range of tax incentives and concessions. This has led to economic and population growth, but also to higher demand for public services such as water which leads to congestion and scarcity. In particular, as water resources have become scarce, the cost of water supply has increased. The dissertation analyzes the conditions that allow for the efficient use of water resources at sustainable levels of economic activity—i. e., employment and investment. In particular, it analyzes the water management strategies that lead to an efficient and sustainable use of water when the source of water is either an aquifer, or there is conjunctive use of ground and imported water. The first part of the dissertation constructs a model of the interactive effects of water supply, wage <b>rates,</b> <b>inward</b> migration of labor and inward investment of capital. It shows how growing water scarcity affects population growth through the impact it has ii on real wage rates, and how this erodes the comparative advantage of Ciudad Juarez— low wages—to the point where foreign investment stops. This reveals the very close connection between water management and the level of economic activity in Ciuda...|$|R
40|$|One-dimensional, convective, {{vertical}} structure models and one dimensional time-dependent, radial diffusion models are combined {{to create a}} self-consistent picture in which FU Orionis outbursts occur in young stellar objects (YSOs) {{as the result of}} a large-scale, self-regulated, thermal ionization instability in the surrounding protostellar accretion disk. Although active accretion disks have long been postulated to be ubiqitous among low-mass YSOs, few constraints have until now been imposed on physical conditions in these disks. By fitting the results of time-dependent disk models to observed timescales of FU Orionis events, we estimate the magnitude of the effective viscous stress in the inner disk (r approximately less than 1 AU) to be, in accordance with an ad hoc 'alpha' prescription, the product of the local sound speed, pressure scale height, and an efficiency factor alpha of 10 (exp - 4) where hydrogen is neutral and 10 (exp 3) where hydrogen is ionized. We hypothesize that all YSOs receive infall onto their outer disks which is steady (or slowly declining with time) and that FU Orionis outbursts are self-regulated, disk outbursts which occur only in systems which transport matter <b>inward</b> at a <b>rate</b> sufficiently high to cause hydrogen to be ionized in the inner disk. We estimate a critical mass flux of dm(sub crit) /dt = 5 x 10 (exp 7) solar mass/yr independent of the magnitude of alpha for systems with one solar mass, three solar radius central objects. Infall accretion rates in the range of dm(sub in) /dt = 1 - 10) x 10 (exp - 6) solar mass/yr produce observed FU Orionis timescales consistent with estimates of spherical molecular cloud core collapse rates. Modeled ionization fronts are typically initiated near the inner edge of the disk and propogate out to a distance of several tens of stellar radii. Beyond this region, the disk transports mass steadily inward at the supplied constant infall rate. Mass flowing through the innermost disk annulus is equal to dm(sub in) /dt only in a time-averaged sense and is regulated by the ionization of hydrogen in the inner disk such that long intervals (approximately 1000 yr) of low-mass flux: (1 - 30) x 10 (exp - 8) solar mass/yr are punctuated by short intervals (approximately 100 yr) of high-mass flux: (1 - 30) x 10 (exp - 5) solar mass/yr. Timescales and mass fluxes derived for quiescent and outburst stages are consistent with estimates from observations of T Tauri and FU Orionis systems, respectively...|$|R
