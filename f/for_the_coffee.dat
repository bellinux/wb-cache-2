5|$|Strong winds {{in southwestern}} Haiti from the {{hurricane}} {{damaged or destroyed}} hundreds of trees. The path of Flora over the area was best determined by the trajectory of fallen trees across the peninsula. The strong winds left entire villages roofless, with many buildings entirely destroyed. The combination of rough waves and strong winds destroyed three entire communities. Many {{of those who died}} in southwestern Haiti suffered from intense burns from strong winds. In most areas, crops were entirely destroyed. The coffee crop was harvested prior to the arrival of the hurricane, though heavy rainfall and severe flooding ruined the crop for later years. Additionally, strong winds downed shading trees <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> crop on the southern peninsula. One official estimated it would require three years <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> crop to be replanted and regrown.|$|E

25|$|The venture was a success, and {{he began}} {{increasing}} {{the size of his}} fleet to accommodate the increasing demand for coffee in London.

25|$|Most of {{the coffee}} {{exported}} was grown around the main centers of population in the Central Plateau and then transported by oxcart to the Pacific port of Puntarenas after the main road was built in 1846. Since the main market <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> was Britain by the mid 1850s, it soon became a high priority to develop an effective transportation route from the Central Plateau to the Atlantic Ocean. For this purpose, in the 1870s, the Costa Rican government contracted with U.S. businessman Minor C. Keith to build a railroad to the Caribbean port of Limón; it also connected San José to Limón. Despite enormous difficulties with construction, disease, and financing, the railroad was completed in 1890.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, the {{dictator}} general Jorge Ubico came to power, {{backed by the}} United States, and initiated {{one of the most}} brutally repressive governments in Central American history. Just as Estrada Cabrera had done during his government, Ubico created a widespread network of spies and informants and had large numbers of political opponents tortured and put to death. A wealthy aristocrat (with an estimated income of $215,000 per year in 1930s dollars) and a staunch anti-communist, he consistently sided with the United Fruit Company, Guatemalan landowners and urban elites in disputes with peasants. After the crash of the New York Stock Exchange in 1929, the peasant system established by Barrios in 1875 to jumpstart coffee production in the country was not good enough anymore, and Ubico was forced to implement a system of debt slavery and forced labor {{to make sure that there}} was enough labor available <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> plantations and that the UFCO workers were readily available.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{large number}} of fair trade and ethical {{marketing}} organizations employing different marketing strategies. Most fair trade marketers believe it is necessary to sell the products through supermarkets to get a sufficient volume of trade to affect the developing world. The Fairtrade brand is by far the biggest of the fair trade coffee brands. Packers in developed countries pay a fee to The Fairtrade Foundation for the right to use the brand and logo, and nearly all the fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee.</b> The coffee has to come from a certified fair trade cooperative, and there is a minimum price when the world market is oversupplied. Additionally, the cooperatives are paid an additional 10c per lb premium by buyers for community development projects. The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as fair trade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices. The exporting cooperative can spend the money in several ways. Some go to meeting the costs of conformity and certification: as they have to meet fair trade standards on all their produce, they have to recover the costs from a small part of their turnover, sometimes as little as 8%, and may not make any profit. Some meet other costs. Some is spent on social projects such as building schools, health clinics and baseball pitches. Sometimes there is money left over for the farmers. The cooperatives sometimes pay farmers a higher price than farmers do, sometimes less, but there is no evidence on which is more common.|$|E

2500|$|The trial {{took place}} from August 8–17, 1994, before New Mexico District Court Judge Robert H. Scott.

Liebeck's lawyers presented the jury with evidence that [...] coffee like that McDonald's served may produce third-degree burns (where skin grafting is necessary) in about 12 to 15 seconds. Lowering the temperature to [...] would increase the time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> to produce such a burn to 20 seconds. Liebeck's attorneys argued that these extra seconds could provide adequate time to remove the coffee from exposed skin, thereby preventing many burns. McDonald's claimed that the reason for serving such hot coffee in its drive-through windows was that those who purchased the coffee typically were commuters who wanted to drive a distance with the coffee; the high initial temperature would keep the coffee hot during the trip. However, the company's own research showed that some customers intend to consume the coffee immediately while driving.|$|E
