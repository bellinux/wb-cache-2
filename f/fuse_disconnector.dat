50|$|The {{company was}} rebuilt in the 1950s. In 1954, a new factory was {{completed}} in Inselstrasse in Stuttgart-Untertürkheim. Founded in Malters, Switzerland, in 1957, SEFAG was the first branch outside Germany. The company began using plastics on an industrial scale in 1962 with the new plant in Winterbach. In 1968, Pfisterer invented the compact screw terminal, which became the technical standard used to connect all new builds in Germany to underground power networks {{from the end of}} the 1960s. The following year, Pfisterer received the patent for compact <b>fuse</b> <b>disconnector</b> strips for low-voltage distributors and used them in plastic distributing cabinets, a new development at the time.|$|E

A theoretical and experimental investigation is attempted of the mechanisms that can affect heat transfer to a component-conductor system, as well the mass and the external surface area of the component. The resulting system of differential equations is solved using the Laplace transform in the s-plane. The time-dependent temperature distribution in the component-conductor system is provided by an analytical expression, and a simple formula is given for the component's stabilised temperature. Results from the models are compared with experimental measurements performed on a fuse holder and are shown to be consistent. The model accuracy is also investigated. It is convincingly shown that excessive (or additional) external surface area of the component's metallic parts reduces the component temperature. Above a certain level, this can make the component act as a cooler of the conductor. In addition, an increase of the component's mass slows temperature stabilisation. The proposed model could effectively support component design as it involves all the technical characteristics of the system, so that the requirements of international standards are fulfilled {{in relation to the}} prevention of overheating. © IEE, 2005...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a {{mathematical}} model is proposed regarding the temperature rise estimation in components installed to electric power distribution networks (e. g. circuit breakers, automatic switches, <b>disconnectors,</b> <b>fuse</b> carriers), during short-circuit faults. The overall short-circuit current waveform and the components' mass and material are considered. The model was applied to a common disconnector of the network and characteristics of the results are plotted according to different forms of the asymmetric part of the short-circuit current waveform and the initial value of the short-circuit d. c. current component. The models' response is also investigated {{for a wide range}} of values of the crossing resistance and the component mass. It is convincingly shown that the short-circuit current waveform asymmetric part and component mass significantly affect temperature rise, and calculations of temperature rise which omit the above factors are questionable. An easy to use approximating equation is proposed, which could be considered in the mathematical approach of the phenomenon, according to international standards and facilitate the above components design.
