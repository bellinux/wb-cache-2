40|$|Traditionally, {{when the}} public sector wanted more capital assets, it {{borrowed}} funds for the purpose. Under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI), private consortia borrow funds to build assets and then, {{in return for a}} charge, use them to provide services for the public sector. The authors explore the implications for the public finances of using the PFI. A widely held belief, which has been put forward by the Treasury, is that using the PFI allows <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> used by the public sector to grow, even within public spending limits, because PFI investments fall outside the ambit of public borrowing. However, the authors show that if a constant amount of spending is transferred every year from traditional finance to PFI finance, then the fall in public borrowing will diminish over time and may eventually wholly disappear. So, even if some PFI finance is used every year, the scope for extra investment will diminish and may eventually disappear. They also show that, if PFI finance is used, then the required tax yield for a given level of investment may be permanently higher or permanently lower. In addition, they show that, even if a switch to PFI did reduce both public borrowing and taxes, then it might not facilitate much extra investment. ...|$|E
40|$|Companies {{experiencing}} {{financial stress}} can attempt to mitigate financial stress through {{restructuring of the}} company's asset base. Management may choose to expand through activities involving <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> in hopes of increasing sales and/or reducing fixed costs per unit produced (sold). Management may also choose to contract the asset base in order to eliminate and/or reduce investment in unprofitable or risky ventures, improve liquidity, reduce earnings volatility, and {{reduce the need for}} operating capital. At issue is the question of how observed changes in the investment base affect the likelihood of emergence from a stressed condition. In this paper, we report on the results of an empirical study that examined this question. We find that, when higher (lower) earnings accompany expansion of the asset base, the likelihood of emergence increases (decreases) as compared to the impact of the same level of earnings for firms that are not expanding. Thus, expansion enhances the impact of the earnings signal. Similarly, contracting firms are more likely to emerge when relatively lower earnings accompany contraction. For contracting firms, however, the lower earnings resulting from mitigation partially cancels the normally positive impact of the unconditional current earnings signal (i. e., the relatively higher the earnings, the greater the likelihood of emergence from stress). Thus, in both cases, the knowledge of expansion and contraction appear to be incrementally useful in explaining emergence from corporate financial stress. ...|$|E

In this review, it used as a guide the concept employed by Lee (2003) and Mason and others (2005), according to which intergenerational transfers refer to the reallocation of economic resources among members of different ages, without an explicit quid pro quo. These transfers differ from other inter-temporal or intergenerational reallocations, such as <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> and credit operations in that the latter involve changes in the capital stock of the economy, transactions of land and property, or borrowing and lending, which are in any case governed by explicit or contractual obligations. 1 Intergenerational transfers are important because in all types of societies they help to smooth out consumption over the life cycle and, in particular, to cover income deficits during the “dependent ” ages of childhood and old age. In Latin America, they are of special relevance because transfers, both intra and intergenerational, are also key to providing basic social protection to the {{significant proportion of the}} population living in poverty or, otherwise, subject to the effects of economic fluctuations, in settings of structurally high levels of socio-economic inequality (Uthoff and others, 2005) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIndustrial {{competitiveness}} {{has required}} from companies elevated quality standards, cost reduction {{and a high}} capacity of delivery. Within this scenario, an important industrial segment has a fundamental role: the tool and die industry. Tools and dies are resources that are fit to a specific task and are either produced as a single-unit batch or intermittently according to demand. Generally, this industrial segment has demonstrated low competitiveness, which in turn affects the performance of other production chains that rely on it. This {{is the case of}} the plastic transformation and metalworking industry, especially when forged and stamped parts are considered. This low competitiveness is a consequence of the deficient corporate structure found in these companies, which results in lack of compliance to quality standards, high costs and long delivery times. Besides the support given to current tool-and-die making clusters, a decentralization structuring project of this industry to other regions of Brazil is necessary. This need is illustrated by new automotive and other consumer goods production plants that have recently started operating in the northeast and central regions of Brazil. In order to contribute to this issue, this article proposes a strategic management model for the incubation process of industrial companies that comply with competitiveness standards required by current market demands. Besides the usual difficulties related to incubation and the creation of any enterprise, the tooling industry faces an additional obstacle related to <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> (buildings, machinery, and software). Therefore, a nucleation process based on an existing structure that will be shared by several companies is proposed (IDS – Industrial Development Structure).

40|$|Abstract: Good {{inventory}} management {{can lead to}} high organisational performance by minimising inventory holding costs and improving customer service across the supply chain. The management of inventory remains a major challenge for many organisations as continuous changes in the supply chain occur. According to the CSIR (2014), investment in inventories across South African supply chains is significant {{and it is difficult}} for South African companies to compete with mature economies on a cost level due to the relative high costs of logistics transportation in the country. Inventory control is often seen as one of the lowest areas of competitive advantage, however it can be the largest single <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> for most organisations. From a theoretical point of view, the Theory of Constraints (TOC) seems to offer a solution to {{inventory management}} challenges. The TOC is a scientific methodology that is designed to assist organisations in identifying and solving critical process based problems following a continuous improvement approach. The TOC also unifies and simplifies the inventory quantity of an organisation into a single value called the buffer quantity. One of the clearly stated advantages of the application of TOC according to literature, is a reduction of inventory levels. This study attempts to support existing literature on the impact of the TOC on buffer levels by means of a case study of an organisation that has undergone a TOC application in South Africa. The primary objective {{of the study was to}} provide a case study implementation of the TOC to corroborate the theory that a successful implementation of the TOC can reduce inventory levels in a South African organisation without adverse effects on customer service levels. A case study of an envelope manufacturer which had implemented TOC principles was conducted through a literature review followed by empirical research to determine the impact of the TOC implementation on the organisation’s buffer inventory levels. The selected organisation provided an opportunity to investigate the scenarios before, during and after a TOC implementation. In-depth, semi structured interviews were conducted with [...] . M. Com.

We derive long-term debt, {{a line of}} credit, and equity as optimal securities, capturing the debt coupon and maturity; the interest rate and limits on the credit line; inside versus outside equity; dividend policy; and capital structure dynamics. The optimal debt-equity ratio is history dependent, but debt and credit line terms are independent of the amount financed and, in some cases, {{the severity of the}} agency problem. In our model, the agent can divert cash flows; we also consider settings in which the agent undertakes hidden effort, or can control cash flow risk. (JEL G 30, G 32, G 35, D 82, D 86, D 92) We develop a model of long-term financial contracting and derive debt and equity as optimal securities. Our analysis captures the optimal coupon and maturity structure for long-term debt; the interest rate and credit available on a line of credit; debt versus (outside) equity financing; and dividend policy. The model has implications for how a firm’s capital structure varies over time. The scenario we consider involves an agent who raises external capital to finance a business opportunity. Among investors ’ concerns in funding a business is that the agent might divert funds to himself, or consume other private benefits, at the expense of investors. Our analysis focuses on this agency problem. Specifically, in the model, a risk-neutral agent seeks funding from riskneutral investors. The funding will finance a business that requires an <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> and generates risky cash flows over the next T periods. The agent observes the realizations of these cash flows but investors do not. The agency problem is that the agent can underreport the cash flow, diverting the cash flow for his own private benefit. At any time during the life of the business, the business can be terminated. In the event of termination, the agent is left to pursue his best alternative and investors are free to make optimal use of the assets. The termination threat is the key to inducing the agent to share the cash flow with investors. A contrac...|$|E
40|$|The lack of {{consistent}} and reliable levels of nutritious food {{may be one}} of the most brutal results of poverty. Beyond the human suffering, the lack of food security has damaging economic consequences, making it difficult for communities to break poverty cycles. This dissertation studies the various decisions made by households, governments, and the international community that impact household food security. Food security, the long-term availability of nutritious foods, is essentially achieved through a trade-off of consumption and <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> and capital to ensure future availability of food. Chapter 2 builds an optimal control model to analyze the trade-offs between stocks of primary forest and agricultural production. This study highlights the role of ecosystem services provided by stocks of forests, which include protection from flooding and erosion, maintenance of soil quality, and contributions to healthy watersheds. The model developed analyzes food production and consumption decisions in the context of sufficient and consistent access to food, particularly represented by changes in the stock of natural capital, in this case primary forest, which is utilized by the population for various reasons, including being cleared to create room for agriculture production. The case study of forest stocks in Nepal demonstrates the cost reductions achieved in the agriculture sector due to the presence of forest stock. The analysis determines optimal levels of per capita agriculture land for the three geographic belts of Nepal: Terai, Hills, and Mountain regions. Steady states in the model are reached beyond 200 years. Chapter 3 employs data from a World Food Program household survey carried out in 2005, analyzes the role of natural capital, social capital, coping strategies, and levels of violence in determining household food security levels. Using remotely sensed data of two time points [...] Thematic Mapper (TM) of 1990 and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) of 2000, vegetation information was derived for the uses of mapping of vegetation quality, the study uses two-stage ordinary least squares and non-linear spatial modeling econometric techniques to analyze the data. The results indicate household food security is positively impacted by higher levels of vegetation cover in the village where a household is located, as well as by higher vegetation quality in areas surround the village. Time spent accessing drinking water from improved sources is observed to have a negative relationship with food security. The existence of social networks was seen to positively impact food security, while households identified as members of a lower caste relate negatively with food security. Coping strategies analyzed include remittances received by the household, access to financial credit, and the receipt of food aid. All of these strategies have a positive impact on the level of household food security. The intensity of violence in the village and surrounding areas throughout the Maoist conflict is observed to have a negative impact on household food security. Chapter 4 undertakes a dynamic panel analysis of the worldwide distribution of emergency food aid in response to natural disasters and the displacement of citizens due to conflict. This is important, as exogenous shocks have the potential to derail the optimal consumption and investment decisions made by households aiming to ensure long-term food security. The data comes from the United Nations WFP Food Aid Information System (FAIS), which aims to provide reliable crosschecked data on all food aid transactions by countries and NGOs, whether or not the food aid was distributed by WFP. The analysis uses a Generalized Method of Moments system approach, which allows a control of the dynamic nature of the data, as well as potential endogeneity issues. As in previous studies, we show a significant relationship between rapid onset disasters (e. g. floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes) and the international response of food aid. Unique to this study, we demonstrate a lag effect of aid in response to gradual onset disasters (droughts, extreme temperature, and disease). This is a particularly important response when considering the potential for increased gradual onset natural disasters in response to climate change. We also show a highly significant and positive relationship between emergency food aid and displaced people. The dissertation provides important results for advising government policy makers and non-governmental organizations to further address food security needs in developing countries. This research highlights the importance of natural and social capital quality in determining food security. Policy implications include investing in measures to conserve natural resources, both in local communities and in surrounding regions. Also, it is important for policies to ensure long-term investment in community groups and networks that improve knowledge transfer and the social safety nets needed by those most at risk. The optimal control model provides insight into the long-term balance between natural capital quality and food production. The combination of spatial information derived from the integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing tools with econometric modeling provides an important picture of the relationship between household food security and nearby vegetation quality, and vegetation quality in areas further away. The dynamic panel analysis of shocks and food aid indicates a need for improved strategies in addressing food security in the critical moments of disasters. EconomicsDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|This report {{considers}} {{the effectiveness of}} investment in the NZ tertiary education sector assets to support educational success. Foreward: Tertiary education institutions – our universities, polytechnics, wānanga, and other tertiary education organisations – make {{an important contribution to}} New Zealand 2 ̆ 7 s social and economic success. In 2015, these institutions held about 9. 7 billion in net assets, including 9. 5 billion in capital assets. In 2014, they also planned to spend a further 8. 2 billion on capital assets by 2024. <b>Investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> has been a theme of my Office 2 ̆ 7 s recent work and this report {{considers the}} effectiveness of investment in tertiary education sector assets to support educational success. To prepare this report we looked at some business cases {{and came up with a}} cost-effectiveness measure. The tertiary education sector is facing pressures from new technology and ways of delivering education, ageing assets, and declining numbers of domestic students. Such pressures are inevitably increasing the level of competition for student enrolments. In this context, the Government 2 ̆ 7 s Tertiary Education Strategy 2014 - 2019 supports social and economic outcomes for the tertiary education sector. The strategy aims to enhance the effectiveness of the sector as a whole, as well as the effectiveness of its parts. High-quality information needs to be provided in a timely and transparent manner to help show whether the strategy is being achieved. Such information is also required to support good accountability in the sector so that New Zealanders can know that the taxes they pay are spent effectively. Each tertiary education institution is required to prepare an investment plan to show how it plans to give effect to the priorities in the tertiary education strategy. For particular capital investments, tertiary education institutions prepare business cases and we reviewed 14 of them. We found those business cases were generally of a high standard. Particular strengths were that: 	benefits, risks, and risk-management approaches for the individual university or polytechnic were usually described in detail; and 	most sections dealing with risk included comments about a range of financial indicators, for example, operating and net surplus, and net cash/debt position. However, there was little evidence of the tertiary education strategy 2 ̆ 7 s aim to enhance the effectiveness of the sector as a whole. In most of the business cases, tertiary education institutions did not: 	take account of the investments planned or made by other tertiary education institutions; nor 	consider how to make the most of their investments by sharing or using the existing assets of other tertiary education institutions. The business cases we looked at were prepared in 2013 and 2014. For 2015 / 16, the Tertiary Education Commission specifically asked tertiary education institutions to "explore ways to increase efficiencies through shared services, infrastructure and other collaboration, such as partnerships". Our findings and this requirement suggest it is important that tertiary education institutions give attention to wider sector considerations when they prepare future business cases to support their major investments. For the purposes of good accountability and effective investments, and because education is so important to New Zealand 2 ̆ 7 s future, we developed a cost-effectiveness measure to see whether system-wide factors could affect the relationship between the money spent on assets and educational outcomes for students – in other words, a basic cost-effectiveness measure that we called "investment effectiveness". There are many ways to measure investment effectiveness. Our measure, for example, did not include research objectives associated with the investment in tertiary education assets. This shows an area of opportunity for tertiary education institutions and other education agencies in the future development of business cases and cost-effectiveness measures. We used publicly available information about tertiary education institutions 2 ̆ 7 assets and education outcomes (educational performance indicators) to apply the measure. Some feedback we received expressed concern about the quality of the educational performance indicators and their use in our measure. If the educational performance indicators do not meet good quality standards, then the sector and individual tertiary education institutions need to improve that accountability information. Applying our measure shows how tertiary education institutions may individually and collectively be affected by changes in their wider environment. We used three scenarios involving changes in student numbers. Using our measure: 	a large change in the number of international students has a small effect on investment effectiveness; 	a small change in domestic student numbers has a comparatively large effect on investment effectiveness; and 	if a group of tertiary education institutions increases its market share, this can decrease the overall (average) investment effectiveness of all tertiary education institutions. When the results of the analysis are put together with what we saw in selected business cases, it is clear that there is an opportunity for education agencies, tertiary education institutions, and other stakeholders to explore the measurement of the effectiveness of investments in tertiary education assets and the potential opportunities for more sector-based investment decisions. Some tertiary education institutions believe that a competitive funding model and regulatory environment make it unlikely that they will work together to improve the collective efficiency of their investments in assets. Others pointed to examples where joint investments have been successfully made and the complexities of the funding and regulatory environment were worked through. These diverse views pose both a challenge to the implementation of the strategy and an opportunity for further conversations and developments. I hope that this report will start conversations in the tertiary sector about the further development and reporting of a range of cost-effectiveness measures and tools, for the sector and for individual tertiary education institutions. I thank the tertiary education institutions, the Ministry of Education, the Tertiary Education Commission, the Treasury, the Productivity Commission, and Education New Zealand for providing us with documents and data for this report.

Of course, other things equal, who’d want to owe someone money? But we borrow not for the sake of it, but to achieve greater benefits than the cost of the loan. Who would escape their mortgages by selling their home? Governments used to do what companies and households still do - borrow to build assets. Of course the scope to spend money with future generations paying the bill can tempt governments into bad projects and unsustainable borrowing to consume. But rather than build the institutions to independently vouchsafe that debt is funding high quality assets rather than consumption or pork barrelling we simply got a bi-partisan political reaction which anathematised debt. That’s produced debt reduction strategies variously good, bad and ugly. Governments sold some assets - which is good where the private sector is a better manager. But reducing debt by under-investing in infrastructure is bad. And things turn ugly when governments use Enron-style accounting to push debt off the books with private financing which involves higher future payments of taxes or charges, inadequate risk transfer and/or dodgy undertakings - for instance to divert traffic onto new privately funded roads. Quick trip under the city anyone? The recent Report of the Owen Inquiry into Electricity Supply in NSW recommended substantial privatisation of the electricity industry. When approached by the NSW unions, we insisted that we wouldn’t oppose this recommendation per se, but that we were as ropable as they were about one of the arguments used to justify it. Remember how the NSW government was reducing state debt? Well debt’s now increasing - but the government still hasn’t institutionally safeguarded the extent of borrowings or the soundness of the projects it’s used to finance. Instead we’ve got the government’s commitment to retaining its AAA credit rating. In fact it’s clear that NSW can hang onto that rating as well as the electricity assets it already owns. It can very probably fund the industry’s 12 billion expansion as well. And if it was unsure it could either have this privately supplied or build new assets in a form that could be sold if and when it became necessary to protect NSW’s credit rating. But whether or not there’s a legitimate case to privatise the electricity industry on productivity grounds, if NSW were being run like a prudent business it would use the strength of its balance sheet to expand its <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> which generate higher returns than the interest cost of funds it borrows. And as would occur in the private sector, the decision about what credit rating to target would emerge from a proper financial analysis taking into account {{the costs and benefits of}} securing AAA rather than populist political posturing. As Professor John Quiggin puts it: A government will generally improve its credit rating by forgoing investment opportunities, even if the investments have an expected rate of return well above the cost of capital. The same is true for corporations, and it is one reason why very few corporations now seek to maintain a AAA rating - the cost in terms of foregone investments exceeds the benefits. If NSW took a single downgrade - to AA, which Standard and Poor’s describes as “very strong,” differing in strength to AAA “to a very small degree” - it could massively increase its investment, providing it was for prudent, productivity enhancing, growth enhancing investment. Whether or not it retains its electricity assets, I’d like to see it borrow to fully fund its superannuation liabilities and any infrastructure assets which proper analysis suggests are cost beneficial. The returns would build up to billions within just a few years. Indeed Professor Quiggin calculates that rejecting the last proposal to privatise the industry in 1997 has already netted the NSW public sector around five to ten billion dollars. That’s not to endorse the loose practices of the past or to oppose privatisation per se. I’ve argued elsewhere for greater independent scrutiny or even control of both the operating and capital aspects of state budgets. Governments fear this for the disciplines it would impose. But they would be different and better disciplines than those of the rating agencies. They might encourage higher surpluses now, but if there’s a downturn they would better enable governments to justify and prudently maintain the substantial deficits that are warranted in such circumstances - deficits the rating agencies won’t fancy. The government recently established a Consultative Reference Committee, chaired by the former premier, Barrie Unsworth, “to test the impacts of changes to the state’s electricity industry which the NSW Government announced last year. ” If a substantial part of the Unsworth committee’s justification for privatising electricity assets is protecting NSW’s AAA credit rating, you’ll know they still don’t “get it. ” I’m guessing that if you wait for hours each week in traffic jams or pay mortgages inflated from lack of infrastructure on land on which we could otherwise have built more houses you probably “got it” some time ago. The government speaks of the privatisation as building for the future. Perhaps. But AAA or no, I 2 ̆ 7 d rather face the future without a financial structure best suited to a retired couple. • Nicholas Gruen is CEO of Lateral Economics and appeared before the Unsworth committee.

A lack of information, {{whether from}} {{non-disclosure}} or complexity of business, creates uncertainty {{that even the}} most sophisticated of investors must face. In this paper, I analyze the relationship between opacity and the systematic risk of bank holding companies. Specifically, I find that <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> opaque <b>assets</b> required to be reported at fair value significantly affect the levels of financial institutions’ systematic risk. Furthermore, I provide evidence that firm <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> opaque <b>assets</b> contribute to systematic risk to an even greater degree during times of financial crisis...|$|R

In this article we {{study the effects of}} a set of more flexible rules – discretionary tax depreciation (DTD) – introduced in the Netherlands during the 2009 – 2011 economic crisis. Our simulation results show DTD, which allows firms to accelerate and also to postpone depreciation, to be much more effective than bonus depreciation in reducing the expected value of tax payments, especially in crisis periods. Using a sample of 325 clients of a single office of a Dutch accounting firm, we show that DTD has led to higher <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> qualifying for discretionary depreciation for firms that faced the highest marginal tax rate. For other firms, the additional investments crowd out <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> that do not qualify for DTD. Our analysis on the actual depreciation choices reveals that firms postpone depreciation when facing losses or loss carry forwards, or to smooth taxable income under the progressive tax system. Our results suggest that a fiscal policy that permits firms to postpone depreciation, as well as to accelerate, may stimulate investment...|$|R
