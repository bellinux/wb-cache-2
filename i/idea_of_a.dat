He also wanted to build a canal through the Isthmus of Darién (now the Isthmus of Panama) but this idea similarly had no success.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} <b>a</b> study <b>of</b> the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal state {{according}} to Edmund Spenser's masterpiece The Faerie Oueene {{and the differences}} between the sixteenth-century England and the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal state found in the poem. The writer sees that the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal state is striking in the poem, for the poem tells about a state, called Faerie Land, where a wise queen rules her people with the help <b>of</b> courageous knights. <b>As</b> the poem was full with allegories of persons or events from the sixteenth-century England, the writer is then triggered to find out, based on the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal state in the poem, whether England's condition in the sixteenth century may be considered as ideal or not. In order to get the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal state in the poem, the writer uses A. J. Greimas' theory of structuralist narratology to reveal the underlying patterns of the poem, supported by the definition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal state. By substituting the actants of the patterns found with the elements <b>of</b> <b>a</b> state, she finds out the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal state according to The Faerie Oueene. The writer discovers the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal state in the poem, which consists of five qualifications for an ideal leader, three qualifications for ideal ministers and three qualifications for ideal people. Furthermore, the writer compares the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal state according to the poem with the condition of England in the sixteenth century by including the allegory of the poem. The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> ideal leader is compared to Queen Elizabeth I, the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> ideal ministers is compared to the English court, and the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> ideal people is compared to English people. Hence, the writer discovers that the sixteenth-century England was different from the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal state in some ways. As a conclusion, the writer states that England in the sixteenth century was not an ideal state, for it was different from the expectation in the poem...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extended unit <b>of</b> action, {{which is the}} idea that the reasons for or against an individual action can depend on the qualities <b>of</b> <b>a</b> larger pattern <b>of</b> action of which it is a part. One concept of joint action is that the unit of action can be extended in this sense. But the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extended unit <b>of</b> action is surprisingly minimal in its commitments. The paper argues for this conclusion by examining uses <b>of</b> the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extended unit <b>of</b> action in four theoretical contexts. It also explains why the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extended unit <b>of</b> action need not involve magical thinking, and discusses possible replies to an objection based on a worry about recklessness...|$|R

5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority. A concurrent majority is {{a system in which}} a minority group is permitted to exercise a sort of veto power over actions of a majority that are believed to infringe upon the minority's rights.|$|E
5|$|Consequences of this {{include the}} time–space frame of a moving body {{appearing}} {{to slow down}} and contract (in the direction of motion) when measured in the frame of the observer. This paper also argued that the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.|$|E
5|$|Despite its post-revolutionary mythology, {{the march}} {{was not a}} {{spontaneous}} event. Numerous calls for a mass demonstration at Versailles had already been made; the Marquis of Saint-Huruge, one of the popular orators of the Palais-Royal, had called for just such a march in August to evict the obstructionist deputies who, he claimed, were protecting the king's veto power. Although his efforts were foiled, revolutionaries continued {{to hold onto the}} <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> march on Versailles to compel the king to accept the Assembly's laws. Speakers at the Palais-Royal mentioned it regularly throughout the next month, creating enduring suspicions of the proprietor, Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> march on Versailles was widespread, and was even discussed {{in the pages of the}} Mercure de France (5 September 1789). A menacing unrest was in the air, and many nobles and foreigners fled the oppressive atmosphere.|$|E
