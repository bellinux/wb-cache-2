40|$|Abstract = Objectives: Paraquat (PQ) is {{a widely}} used <b>ionic</b> <b>pesticide</b> that is fatal when {{ingested}} accidentally or for suicidal purposes. It is thought that chronic exposure of PQ is related {{with the development of}} Parkinson's disease, but epidemiological studies have not yet confirmed that theory. This study attempted to estimate the possibility of environmental PQ exposure through soil and water. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the amount of decomposed PQ solution in wet soil after exposure to ultraviolet light. An artificial rainfall condition was simulated over soil sprayed with PQ to measure the amount of eluted PQ. In addition, PQ was diluted in water from three differently rated rivers and the changes in PQ concentration were measured after ultraviolet exposure over one month. High performance liquid chromatography/ultra violet detection was used to analyze the concentrations of PQ. Results: In the method we used, the recovery rate of PQ showed a precision rate less than 5 %, an accuracy greater than 88 %, and the calibration equation was y= 5538. 8 x- 440. 01 (R 2 = 0. 9985). There {{were no significant differences in}} the concentrations of PQ obtained from the three specimens over a 1 -week period. From the PQ-sprayed soil, the artificial rainfall conditions showed no PQ elution over a 1 -month period, and there was no significant differences in PQ concentrations according to ultraviolet exposure among the thre...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEnhanced {{groundwater}} monitoring has {{highlighted the}} contamination by pesticides and their metabolites {{which can be}} more problematic than parent compounds. The fate of pesticides has widely been studied in soil, where major processes such as sorption and degradation lead to reduction of the flux likely to leach into the groundwater. Thanks to laboratory experiments, identifying the key parameters controlling these processes (role of organic carbon, pH influence on <b>ionic</b> <b>pesticide,</b> formation of bound residues, [...] .) is now possible. As these processes are not instantaneous, it appears necessary to evaluate the impact of hydrodynamic by studying, for example, the leaching of these molecules into soil columns. However, soil must {{not be the only}} compartment investigated. Indeed when dealing with groundwater, it is essential to also consider both the unsaturated and saturated zones. Studying processes in the unsaturated zone is a challenge, especially when its thickness exceeds several meters. However drilling of non-destructive cores (without fluid) allows the collection of geological materials that can be considered for laboratory experiments (batches, respirometers, percolation through undisturbed columns, [...] .). While a long-term and regular monitoring is essential to describe the groundwater contamination, it is also crucial to implement multidisciplinary approaches to understand the transfer of these substances into aquifers. Assessment of groundwater quality by statistical approaches such as the Mann-Kendall test allows the description of trends, but cannot predict the impact of remediation measures applied to reduce the contamination. Taking into account hydrodynamics by using the age of the water (calculated by tritium, CFCs and SF 6 techniques) may be useful to understand spatial and temporal trends of pesticide concentrations in groundwater at both aquifer and regional scales. Geochemical approaches are also required to understand how water and solutes migrate across the aquifer. More recently, the characterization of the stable isotope signatures (e. g. δ 13 C, δD) of pesticides showed promise to discriminate sources of contamination and processes taking place in the aquifers (degradation vs. dilution, biodegradation vs. chemical degradation). Lastly, modelling appears a way to evaluate the impact of the superimposed processes occurring in the soil-unsaturated-saturated zones continuum, provided that each compartment is considered separately. Examples resulting from different lab and field experiments will be presented here in order to demonstrate how the implementation of multidisciplinary approaches leads to a better description and understanding of the pesticide fate and their impact on groundwater quality...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{chemical}} components of cork in the sorption of several pesticides has been investigated. For this purpose raw cork and three cork extracted fractions (i. e. cork free of aliphatic extractives, cork free of all extractives and cork free of all extractives and suberin) {{were used as}} sorbent of three <b>ionic</b> <b>pesticides</b> (propazine, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2, 4 -D) and alachlor) and five non-ionic pesticides (chlor-pyrifos, isoproturon, metamitron, methomyl and oxamyl) with a logK(ow) within the range - 0. 47 to 4. 92. The effect of cations on the <b>ionic</b> <b>pesticides,</b> propazine and 2, 4 -D sorption was also analyzed. Results indicated that the highest yields were obtained for chlorpyrifos and alachlor sorption onto raw cork (> 55 %). After removal of aliphatic extractives sorption of all pesticides increased that ranged from 3 % for propazine to 31 % for alachlor. In contrast, removal of phenolic extractives caused a sorption decrease. Low sorption yields were obtained for hydrophobic pesticides such as metamitron, oxamyl and methomyl (< 11 %) by using all cork fractions and extremely low when using raw cork (< 1 %). FTIR analysis was useful to indicate that lignin moieties were the main components involved on the sorption process. Modelling calculations evidenced that pi-stacking interactions with the aromatic groups of lignin {{play a major role}} in determining the adsorption properties of cork toward aromatic pesticides.

40|$|Irregular pagination. Missing p. 89 in Vault copy too. There is {{a growing}} concern about the {{persistence}} of pesticide residues in soils and their subsequent movement to groundwater and surface water. Sorption of pesticide by soil particles {{is one of the key}} processes affecting the fate of pesticides in soil. The overall objective of this research was to examine the sorption and movement of ionic (2, 4 -D, atrazine and metsulfuron methyl) and non-ionic (phorate and terbufos) pesticides in a range of allophanic and non-allophanic soil materials of New Zealand. Firstly, the methods of measuring pesticide in the soil solution were evaluated. The results suggested that radiotracer techniques can be used to measure low concentrations of pesticide in the soil solution during sorption studies. Based on this, the sorption and movement of pesticides was examined using 14 C-labelled compounds. Complete recovery of 14 C pesticide residues in soils was achieved by direct extraction of soils with a scintillation cocktail, which contained an organic solvent. The effect of drying soils on the sorption and leaching of an inorganic anion (phosphate; P) and organic pesticides (2, 4 -D and phorate) was examined using field-moist, freeze-dried, air-dried and oven-dried soil samples. Compared to field-moist and freeze-dried, both air-drying and oven-drying of soil increased the sorption of P, but decreased the sorption of pesticides. Solubilization of organic carbon during air-drying and oven-drying may have increased the accessibility of P to sorption sites on the mineral surfaces and thereby increased the sorption. In contrast, the addition of water soluble organic carbon bound onto pesticides in solution and decreased the apparent sorption onto the soil; thereby increasing leaching. Pesticide sorption was measured in a range of allophanic and non-allophanic topsoil and subsoil samples using a batch equilibrium technique. In general, pesticide sorption, as measured by the distribution coefficient (Kd), increased with an increase in octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) of the pesticide and followed the order: terbufos > phorate > 2, 4 -D > atrazine > metsulfuron methyl. The Kd values increased with increasing organic carbon content of the soils and when the sorption was normalised to organic carbon (Koc) there was less variation in Koc values between the soils. Removal of organic carbon decreased the sorption of pesticides and the effect was more pronounced with non-ionic than with the <b>ionic</b> <b>pesticides.</b> The results suggest that organic carbon is the principal sorbent for non-ionic pesticides, whereas clay is also contributing to the sorption of <b>ionic</b> <b>pesticides.</b> Multiple regression models were developed to predict pesticide sorption based on soil properties. The existing empirical equations based on Kow values gave unsatisfactory predictions of pesticide sorption in the soils examined. The contribution of different particle size fractions of soils to sorption and desorption of pesticides was examined using two soils with contrasting characteristics. The Kd values decreased in the order: clay > silt > sand. Organic carbon accounted for most of the variation in Kd values between the particle size fractions, and the removal of organic carbon decreased the Kd values of the pesticides. Following four successive extractions with 0. 01 M CaCl 2, 65 - 90 % and 22 - 75 % of the initially sorbed <b>ionic</b> and non-ionic <b>pesticides,</b> respectively were released from the particle size fractions. Greater amounts of pesticides were released from the soil fractions from which organic carbon had been removed than from natural soil fractions and the difference was greater for the non-ionic than the <b>ionic</b> <b>pesticides.</b> Experiments were conducted to examine the effects of different sources of added carbon (peat, sludge, mushroom compost, pig manure and poultry manure), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on the sorption and movement of pesticides in soils. Added carbon sources increased the sorption of pesticides and followed the order: peat > sludge > pig manure > mushroom compost > poultry manure. The differences in the effect of carbon addition on the sorption of pesticides may be related to the differences in their effect on DOC and pH of the soil. Premixing DOC with the pesticide solutions decreased the pesticide sorption whereas premixing DOC with soil increased the pesticide sorption. Column studies showed that pesticide mobility was enhanced by the presence of DOC. Column leaching experiments were conducted to examine the movement of pesticides through repacked soil cores (step-function and pulse inputs) and intact cores (step-function input) using two soils with different pesticide sorption capacities. In repacked soil columns, the step-function experiments showed a symmetrical breakthrough curve (BTC) for a non-sorbed solute (3 H 20) with a sigmoidal shape, whereas there was an asymmetrical BTC with extensive tailing for a sorbed solute (2, 4 -D). In the pulse experiments the leaching of pesticides decreased with an increase in the Kd values and leaching decreased in the order: terbufos > phoratc > 2, 4 -D > atrazine. The results from the intact core experiments suggested that both the sorbed (2, 4 -D) and non-sorbed (3 H 20) solutes move preferentially through macropores such as worm holes and root channels. The convection-dispersion equation (CDE) either with an equilibrium or a bicontinuum non-equilibrium sorption process was used to simulate the measured effluent BTCs obtained by simultaneous displacement of 3 H 20 and 2, 4 -D. The CDE with an equilibrium sorption process failed to simulate the BTC for 2, 4 -D in repacked and intact soil columns; whereas the CDE with a bicontinuum non-equilibrium sorption process provided a good description of the experimental data. Both chemical (intraorganic matter diffusion) and physical (preferential flow) processes are involved in the non-equilibrium sorption during the movement of pesticides in soil...|$|R

40|$|The {{contamination}} of surface and ground water by bentazone has attracted increasing global concern in recent years. We conducted a detailed investigation using MIEX resin to eliminate bentazone from waters. Batch experiments {{were carried out}} to evaluate the effect of process parameters, such as retention time, resin amount, and initial pesticide concentration, on removal efficiency of bentazone. Results showed the sorption process was fast and bentazone could be efficiently removed in 30 minutes. The kinetic process of bentazone sorption on MIEX resin was well described by pseudo second-order model and intraparticle diffusion was the rate controlling step. The MIEX resin possessed the highest sorption capacity of 0. 2656 mmol/mL for bentazone according to Langmuir fitting. Bentazone is a hydrophobic ionizable organic compound, and both ionic charge and hydrophobic aromatic structure governed the sorption characteristics on MIEX resin. The different removal efficiencies of <b>ionic</b> and non-ionic <b>pesticides,</b> combined with the charge balance equations of bentazone, SO 4 (2 -), NO 3 - and Cl-, indicated that removal of bentazone using MIEX resin occurred primarily via ion exchange.

40|$|Olive {{oil mill}} wastewaters (OMW) are dark-colored wastes {{characterized}} by high values of COD (chemical oxygen demand) and BOD (biological oxygen demand). OMW contains high amounts of organic and inorganic compounds. The first category includes mostly sugars, polyphenols, organic acids, proteins, fatty substances, mixed phenol-polysaccharide polymers, polyalcohols, cellulose and hemicellulose, pectins and tannins. The inorganic substance, present in lower amount, includes mainly potassium and, {{to a lesser}} degree, sodium, calcium and magnesium as cations, and chlorides, phosphates and sulphates as anions. OMW, for their composition, are particularly dangerous for soil and waters if dispersed unprocessed because of phenolic compounds and long-chain fatty acids which have phytotoxic and antimicrobial properties. So, {{the aim of this}} thesis is to develop integrate strategies aimed at valorisation and/or disposing of OMW. In order to obtain by-products to reuse in environmental technology processes the recovery of organic matter from this waste was performed. Polymerin, the high molecular organic fraction of OMW, is a polyelectrolyte with humic-like properties and {{can be used as a}} potential bio-filter for decontamination of polluted wastewaters because exhibited very interesting sorption capacities for cationic and anionic heavy metals, <b>ionic</b> or ionisable <b>pesticides</b> and hydrophobic organic compounds. The first aim of this thesis is the use of polymerin for the decontamination of wastewaters contamined by pesticides. A study was performed on the sorption capacity of polymerin towards the cyhalofop acid (CyA), a new generation aryloxyphenoxypropionic herbicide, and compare it with a mineral matrix, the ferrihydrite, and an organo-mineral one, the ferrihydrite-polymerin complex. Moreover, we performed another comparative study on sorption capacity of polymerin and two mesoporous mineral matrices, Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 towards the 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), a phenoxyacetic herbicide, and 2 -choloro- 4, 6 -bis(ethylamino) -s-triazine (simazine), a chlorotriazinic one. Cyhalofop-butyl (CyB), 2 -[4 -(4 -cyano- 2 -fluoro-phenoxy) phenoxy]propanoic acid, butyl ester (R), recently introduced from Dow AgroSciences, is used for the post-emergence control of grasses in rice, mainly against barnyard grass (Echinochloa species) and silver top (Lepthochloa fusca species). The ester presents a low water solubility, but it hydrolyzes rapidly into its corresponding derivative 2 - 4 -(4 -cyano- 2 -fluorophenoxy) phenoxy] propionic acid (CyA), which is much more soluble and presents the effective herbicide action. Moreover, CyA is the effective chemical compound occurring in water after its application on the crop because it originates by the rapid hydrolysis of its corresponding butyl ester form. Among the different pollutants commonly found in soil and waters, MCPA deserves a particular interest. It is a post emergence phenoxy acid herbicide extensively used in agriculture to control annual and perennial weeds in cereals, grasslands, trees, and turf. It is very soluble (273. 9 mg/L in water, at neutral pH), highly mobile, and can leach from soil and it is suspected for mutagen and carcinogen properties. This compound has been found in well water in some countries and is classified by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a potential groundwater contaminant. Simazine is a synthetic s-triazine herbicide widely used for pre-emergence control of broad-leaf weeds and annual grasses in agricultural and non-crop fields. Simazine is the second most commonly detected pesticide in surface and groundwaters in the United States, Australia and Europe. It is persistent in the environment up to eight months and not easily degraded by microbes. Due to the carcinogenic potential of s-triazines, simazine presence in water is of increasing concern. Effects of pH, contact time, initial concentration and sorbent dosage on the sorption of the herbicides were investigated. The most efficient sorbent for cyhalofop acid showed to be ferrihydrite followed by ferrihydrite-polymerin complex and polymerin; while for MCPA and simazine the collected data evidenced the greater sorption efficiency of Al 2 O 3 with respect to Fe 2 O 3 and polymerin. In particular, cyhalofop acid bonds to ferrihydrite by a combination of ionic and ion-dipole bonds, the ferrihydrite-polymerin complex by ionic bonds and polymerin by hydrogen ones. Sorption of MCPA on polymerin occurred by the formation of H-bonds while for simazine by hydrogen and ionic bonds. Moreover, MCPA is assumed to be bond to Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 by a combination of ionic and ion-dipole interactions. Simazine is sorbed on Fe 2 O 3 by hydrogen bonds and because of the high acidity of this matrix also by electrostatic interactions, while on Al 2 O 3 sorption occurred only by hydrogen bonds. So, the highest superficial surface area of Al 2 O 3 than Fe 2 O 3 and the presence of secondary small pores at boundary of micropores region has a positive influence in the uptake of simazine and MCPA. Simulated wastewaters contaminated with cyhalofop acid were completely purified by two sorption cycles on ferrihydrite and five cycles on the ferrihydrite-polymerin complex, whereas the same wastewaters maintained a constant residue even after five sorption cycles on polymerin. The same experiment carried out for MCPA and simazine indicated that Al 2 O 3 allowed the total removal of MCPA by four sorption cycles and a removal of 84 % of simazine after only two sorption cycles, whereas on Fe 2 O 3 MCPA was removed for 92 % after five cycles and simazine for 69 % after five cycles. Cyclic sorption experiments on polymerin revealed that no total removal was possible for both pesticides. An ideal sorbent should have a high surface area (i. e., high density of sorption sites), uniformly accessible pores and physical and/or chemical stability. It is believed that the sorption capacity of a sorbent is largely determined by the surface area available which increases with decreasing the particle size although the pores size distribution is also decisive for an optimal sorption process. Therefore, with the introduction of nanoscaled oxide materials, the pollutant removal efficiency can be increased dramatically. So, mineral matrices can be used as sorbents for a fast and highly efficient removal of <b>ionic</b> and ionisable <b>pesticides</b> and as a suitable filters for the decontamination of point sources. Moreover, Al 2 O 3 can be regenerated by incineration method and could be considered for small-scale treatment systems and industrial scale. A further innovative strategy, aimed to enhance the valorisation of OMW, concerns their use as grow media for oleaginous microorganisms, for potential biodiesel production, so this use could be a convenient alternative to avoid the negative environmental impact associated with its discharge. The demand for fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) as diesel fuel (biodiesel) has increased significantly. Microorganisms can accumulate high levels of lipids and do not require arable land. Therefore, the microbial lipids can potentially be used as raw material for biodiesel production using the common way to produce FAMEs in the biodiesel industry. The second aim of this thesis is to investigate the potential of Lipomyces starkeyi, an oleaginous yeast able to survive and proliferate in the presence of olive oil mill wastewaters, as a source of lipids. L. starkeyi proved to store large amounts of lipids, showing only a minimal reutilization of the stored ones. It was grown in the presence of undiluted OMW, without external organic supplements, producing a significant reduction of both the total organic carbon (TOC) and the total phenol content. The OMW treated by L. starkeyi showed a significant increase of the germination index. The preliminary dilution of OMW enhanced the reduction of polluting components of OMW, leading to a complete TOC removal, as well as to lower levels of residual phenols. The activities of extracellular lipases and esterases significantly increased in the course of the OMW fermentation. A significant increase in lipid yield was observed in L. starkeyi in the course of the OMW treatment, particularly enhanced when the feedstock was preliminarily diluted. The fatty acid distribution showed a prevalence of oleic acid, demonstrating the potential of L. starkeyi as a source of lipids to be used as a feedstock for the synthesis of II generation biodiesel. Finally, we investigated the effect of immobilization of two laccases, from the fungi Myceliophthora thermophila and Trametes versicolor, on different supports. These enzymes are able to degrade a wide array of substrates, abundant in olive oil mill wastewaters, such as phenols, aromatic amines, benzenethiols, hydroxyindoles and phenothiazinic compounds. The third aim of this thesis is to evaluate the enhance of operational stability and durability of the enzymes after immobilization. Laccase is a multi-copper oxidase, able to catalyze the one-electron oxidation of a wide array of substrates with the simultaneous reduction of oxygen to water. The low substrate specificity exhibited by laccase and its ability to oxidize priority pollutants has attracted interest for its use in wastewaters treatment and bioremediation. Many laccases from different sources could be considered for biotechnological applications, but laccases from higher plants and bacterial strains are less capable to degrade polymers of phenolic origin, including lignin, than laccases from fungi. In particular, it is well documented that thermophilic fungi may comprise a rich source of thermostable industrial enzymes. Furthermore, the thermal tolerance is an attractive feature for many biotechnological applications of enzymes. In the present thesis we used a fungal laccase (Novozym 51003) from the thermophilic ascomycete Myceliophthora thermophila and a laccase from basidiomycete fungus Trametes versicolor. This latter was reported to have the highest redox potential among laccases; i. e., 785 mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode, which makes this enzyme particularly interesting since high redox potentials correlate with high activity. However, enzymes are soluble and they cannot easily be used for many reaction cycles, are quite unstable under conditions of high temperatures, extreme pHs or use of organic co-solvents or toxic products, because of that the enzymes have to be stabilized to convert the process in a profitable one. The immobilization of two laccases presented in this thesis allowed to obtain heterogeneous catalysts with good perspectives to be used at industrial level in different processes of oxidation of products highly toxic. The use of different techniques of immobilization allowed having catalysts with different activities and stabilities for their use in processes in which different conditions of pH, temperature or the presence of denaturant agents (unfolding agents or organic cosolvents) are required. Both the enzymes were able to be purified almost completely in only one step of adsorption-desorption using anionic exchanger supports. The immobilization of laccase from Myceliopthora thermophila was performed using different supports by which catalyst with different activities and stabilities were obtained. Non aminated enzyme only could be immobilized on supports capable to immobilize through the richest place in negative charges as aminated or glutaraldehyde supports. The amination of this laccase was performed in a very simple way, so the immobilization of the aminated enzyme allowed obtaining derivatives more stable than that obtained with the non aminated enzyme. The most stable derivatives in all assayed inactivation conditions were those where the aminated enzyme was immobilized on heterofunctional supports activated with iminodiacetic acid (IDA) and glyoxyl groups. These derivatives were immobilized through the richest place in positive charges and were more than 30 times more stable than soluble enzyme in some of the assayed conditions; in addition they resulted slightly more stable against the presence of organic cosolvent or in the presence of unfolding reagents (urea). As regards Trametes versicolor laccase, the enzyme was first aminated and than immobilized on glyoxyl supports obtaining derivatives with different stabilization factors depending of the incubation conditions during the immobilization process. The best stabilizations were obtained after incubation at pH 10 where it was possible to obtain stabilization factors over 70 times if compared with the stability of the soluble enzyme or the correspondent one point immobilized derivative (cyanogen bromide support). In addition the best derivatives were at least twice more stable against organic solvents. In conclusion, in the present thesis different strategies aimed at a biotechnological employment of olive oil mill wastewaters have been proposed, in order to remediate water polluted from pesticide and, at the same time, to valorize this waste using it for potential biodiesel production. Moreover, among the technologies developed to disposing of OMW, the use of laccases immobilized on new generation supports is an innovative and great important strategy...|$|R
