25|$|Finally, a {{possible}} fate of negative muons bound to conventional atoms {{is that they}} are captured by the weak-force by protons in nuclei <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> electron-capture-like process. When this happens, the proton becomes a neutron and a muon neutrino is emitted.|$|E

25|$|As President, Ciampi was not {{considered}} to be close to the positions of the Vatican and the Catholic Church, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> alternance after the devout Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. He often praised patriotism, not always a common feeling in Italy because of its abuse by the fascist regime.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, the {{planning}} ideas of modernism {{were starting to}} be questioned, resulting in suburbs with a denser planning, such as Skarpnäck. In the 1990s this idea was taken further {{with the development of}} and old industrial area close to the inner city, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> mix of modernistic and urban planning in the new area of Hammarby Sjöstad.|$|E

25|$|So Thommo begins - {{the high}} {{stepping}} gait of a thoroughbred, bowling hand bobbing at waist {{level and the}} ball visible. It is conventional and comforting because facing a strange bowler {{for the first time}} invariably generates edginess. Then, in the split second before delivery, at gather, Thommo drags one leg behind the other <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> Swan Lake crossover, sways back and hides the ball behind his right knee - unconventional and very unsettling.|$|E
25|$|Ludwig van Beethoven {{revolutionized}} timpani {{music in}} the early 19th century. He not only wrote for drums tuned to intervals other than a fourth or fifth, but he gave a prominence to the instrument as an independent voice beyond programmatic use. For example, his Violin Concerto (1806) opens with four solo timpani strokes, and the scherzo of his Ninth Symphony (1824) sets the timpani (tuned an octave apart) against the orchestra <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> call and response.|$|E
25|$|Coelacanths are {{opportunistic}} feeders, hunting cuttlefish, squid, snipe eels, small sharks, {{and other}} fish {{found in their}} deep reef and volcanic slope habitats. Coelacanths are also known to swim head down, backwards or belly up to locate their prey, presumably using their rostral glands. Scientists suspect one reason this fish has been so successful is that specimens are able to slow down their metabolisms at will, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> hibernation mode.|$|E

25|$|Their {{presence}} in the Mont'e Prama necropolis has been explained by Lilliu with two alternative hypotheses: the baetyls originated from a wrecked giants’ tomb or they are reproductions of more ancient specimens, due to a wish to preserve an ancient line of Nuragic tradition, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> nostalgic commemoration. The double row of holes noticed {{in one of the}} baetyls from Mont'e Prama, unattested elsewhere in Sardinia, suggests that these artifacts are the same age as the necropolis. Some scholars believe in fact that they were expressly produced for the Monti Prama complex.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes saints {{are shown}} {{together}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> pictorial gallery, but {{the depiction of}} narratives is also common. This may {{take the form of}} a single incident, such as Saint Sebastian tied to a tree and bristling with arrows or St Christopher carrying the Christ Child across the river, or the saint's life may be shown in a narrative sequence, similar to the way in which the life of Jesus is depicted, such as the Life of St Augustine by Benozzo Gozzoli in the Church of Sant' Agostino, San Gimignano.|$|E
25|$|Traditionists who {{account for}} the {{majority}} of clerics keep themselves away from modernity and neither accept nor criticize it. Traditionalists believe in eternal wisdom and are critics of humanism and modernity. Traditionalists believe <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> religious pluralism which makes them different from Fundamentalists. Fundamentalists are also against modernity. Contrary to traditionists, fundamentalists openly criticize modernity. Moreover, fundamentalists believe that for reviving the religion in the modern era and for opposing modernity, they need to gain social and political power. This makes fundamentalists different from traditionists and traditionalists who are not interested in gaining political power.|$|E

The method may not be perfect, but it is all I have.|$|E
25|$|Making his {{comeback}} to Romania in October 1894, Iorga {{settled in the}} capital city of Bucharest. He changed residence several times, until eventually settling in Grădina Icoanei area. He agreed to compete <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> debating society, with lectures which only saw print in 1944. He applied for the Medieval History Chair at the University of Bucharest, submitting a dissertation in front of an examination commission comprising historians and philosophers (Caragiani, Odobescu, Xenopol, alongside Aron Densușianu, Constantin Leonardescu and Petre Râșcanu), but totaled a 7 average which only entitled him to a substitute professor's position. The achievement, at age 23, was still remarkable in its context.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} {{consensus is}} that the explosion {{was caused by the}} impact of a small asteroid; however, there are a few dissenters. Astrophysicist Wolfgang Kundt has proposed that the Tunguska event was caused by the release and subsequent explosion of 10 million tons of natural gas from within earth's crust. The basic idea is that natural gas leaked out of the crust and then rose to its equal-density height in the atmosphere; from there, it drifted downwind, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> wick, which eventually found an ignition source such as lightning. Once the gas was ignited, the fire streaked along the wick, and then down to the source of the leak in the ground, whereupon there was the explosion.|$|E

25|$|The towers, top to bottom, are a {{honeycomb}} lattice made of brickwork. 60 of {{more than}} 200 cells were glazed with windows (of three different frame designs), the rest filled with clay and scrap. This unorthodox design was {{a direct consequence of}} material rationing by the state– Melnikov was limited to brick and wood, and even these were in short supply. The wooden ceilings have no supporting columns, nor horizontal girders. They were formed by a rectangular grid of flat planks, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> orthotropic deck. The largest room, a 50 square meter workshop on the third floor, is lit with 38 hexagonal windows; equally large living room has a single wide window above the main entrance.|$|E
25|$|Before any of {{us could}} rise to examine it, four more lights {{appeared}} almost simultaneously, about the same shape, and varying only in size. Surrounding each one was the dim outline of a small human figure, black and grotesque, more like a little image carved out of black shining wood, than anything else I can liken them to. Dorothea kissed her hands to these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence. As {{for me and my}} companions, we were so awe-struck yet amused at these comical shapes, that we could not move or speak until they themselves seemed to flit about <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> wavering dance, and then vanish, one by one.|$|E
25|$|In its call-and-response singing set to ostinato-based rhythms {{played on}} {{two or three}} squat drums (barriles), bomba resembles other neo-African genres in the Caribbean. Of clear African {{provenance}} is its format in which a single person emerges from an informal circle of singers to dance {{in front of the}} drummers, engaging the lead drummer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> playful duel; after dancing for a while, that person is then replaced by another. While various such elements can be traced to origins in Africa or elsewhere, bomba must be regarded as a local Afro-Puerto Rican creation. Its rhythms (e.g. seis corrido, yubá, leró, etc.), dance moves, and song lyrics that sometimes mimic farm animals(in Spanish, with some French creole words in eastern Puerto Rico) collectively constitute a unique Puerto Rican genre.|$|E
