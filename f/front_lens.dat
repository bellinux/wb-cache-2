25|$|HID lamps emit {{infrared}} energy that can defrost {{snow and ice}} from the <b>front</b> <b>lens</b> of a headlamp, while LEDs do not, and need to cycle heat from the heat-sink {{to the front of}} the panel to de-ice and de-fog the lens.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of intelligent fixtures employ arc lamps {{as a light}} source, and therefore {{use a variety of}} mechanical methods to achieve the effect of dimming. Some fixtures employ standard halogen lamps. Mechanically, stepper motors connected to various internal optical devices (such as gobos and color wheels) manipulate the light before it escapes the fixture's <b>front</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Intelligent {{fixtures}} usually employ compact {{arc lamps}} as light sources.

40|$|A new {{subminiature}} endoscope {{which used}} for reconnaissance and diagnosis has been designed. This subminiature endoscope is designed based on imaging fiber bundle and consist of the <b>front</b> object <b>lens</b> whose aperture is only 0. 5 mm, imaging fiber bundle and the post coupling lens. It realized by using subminiature optical systems. The FOV(field of view) and the focal {{length of the}} <b>front</b> object <b>lens</b> are 50 degrees and 0. 59 mm. And the object distance, F number and detected imaging high of the <b>front</b> object <b>lens</b> are 3 mm, 6 and 0. 5 mm. The total number of the imaging fiber bundle are 10000 and it&# 39;s pixel cell size is 5 mu m. The effective aperture of the imaging fiber bundle is 0. 46 mm. The post coupling lens has a reduction ratio of 1. 73. It&# 39;s object distance and imaging height are 5 mm and 0. 8 mm. The Numerical Aperture (NA) of the <b>front</b> object <b>lens,</b> imaging fiber bundle and the post coupling lens are matching will. The coupling efficiency of the imaging fiber bundle is above 93 % and the system&# 39;s design result can meet the need of the limit resolution of the imaging fiber. This kind of the fiber endoscope has the peculiarity of wide FOV, fine imaging quality, compact configuration, low finished cost and etc. It is meaningful to realize the objective of miniaturization, batch-type production and high imaging quality of the endoscope. </p...|$|R

50|$|The Type 018 Retina Ib, Type 020 Retina IIc and Type 021 Ausf I. Retina IIIc are {{introduced}} {{in the spring of}} 1954 at Photokina in Cologne, Germany. Both the Retina IIc and Retina IIIc had interchangeable <b>front</b> <b>lens</b> elements with f:5,6 35mm and f:4 80mm <b>front</b> <b>lens</b> components available; however, the cameras could not be folded closed with the accessory lenses. Both Retina-Xenon C or Retina-Heligon C lenses were offered on the Type 020 and Type 021 Ausf I. Type 021 Ausf II Retina IIIc was introduced in summer of 1957 with a single range exposure meter. Type 019 Ausf. I Retina IB was also introduced at this time.|$|E

25|$|Albert Almoznino {{suggests}} {{to use a}} white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of muslin or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a rear projection screen, but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the <b>front</b> <b>lenses</b> removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} size of {{an internal}} focusing lens does not change during focus, nor does the <b>front</b> of the <b>lens</b> rotate. This is particularly useful for large lenses, keeping the size more compact, or when using filters or accessories mounted on the <b>front</b> of the <b>lens</b> that may require careful alignment.One issue internal focusing lens can have is that the true focal length of the lens is reduced when not focused at infinity.|$|R
