5|$|With <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> {{breathing}} {{down the}} necks {{of anyone who}} peeks into the Congressional Record or Senate reports, {{the other members of}} the Court may have concluded that the benefit of citing legislative history does not outweigh its costs. It is likely for this reason that the percentage of cases citing it has decreased dramatically. No one likes an unnecessary fight, especially not one with as formidable an opponent as <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Finally, <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> chastises the Court {{for taking}} equity {{jurisdiction}} {{of the case and}} draws an analogy with Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U.S. 738 (1975). In that case, the Supreme Court declined passing judgment on the decision of a military court-martial before it finished its work; Scalia argues that likewise, the military commissions in Cuba have not yet ended their work regarding Hamdan and therefore should not be subject to judicial oversight.|$|E
25|$|<b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> concurred in {{everything}} except Part III-A-2, {{the section on}} legislative history.|$|E

40|$|This legal sidebar briefly {{provides}} an overview of the major implications of <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia's</b> death for Congress. <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia's</b> absence may alter the outcome of several cases of interest to Congress pending before the Court and could mark a seismic shift in many legal doctrines, depending on who is confirmed to fill the newly vacant seat on the Court. The job of confirming the President's nomination to fill the vacancy resides with the Senate, making <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia's</b> death likely to have a profound impact in both the short and long term on Congress...|$|R

25|$|The {{ruling was}} 6–3 with <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> joining Justices Kennedy, Stevens, Ginsburg, Souter and Breyer for the majority.|$|E
25|$|The Court's opinion, {{written by}} <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia,</b> began by {{describing}} the assumptions {{under which the}} Court would decide the case.|$|E
25|$|<b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> {{agreed with}} the plurality's overall finding, i.e. that the Appeals Court's {{decision}} must be reversed. However, he differed from the plurality by arguing that the Indiana statute did not regulate any kind of expression, merely conduct. As such, <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> believed, it was inappropriate to apply First Amendment scrutiny to the statute in the first place. <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> took a more formalistic approach to constitutional interpretation than his benchmates {{by looking at the}} text of the statute itself and, seeing no reference express or implied to the limitation of any form of expression, deciding {{that there can be no}} First Amendment question present at all. Language he used later in his opinion demonstrates the originalist views that characterized Justice Scalia's tenure on the bench.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{makes two}} main points. First, the majority’s {{interpretation}} of the CWC Act is inconsistent with the statute and the underlying treaty. Indeed, the majority opinion displays a basic misunderstanding of {{the design of the}} underlying treaty. Second, <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia’s</b> construction of the Necessary and Proper Clause is antithetical to the structure and original understanding of the Constitution. If adopted as law, <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia’s</b> view would seriously harm the federal government’s ability to conduct foreign affairs on behalf of the nation. Since <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia’s</b> constitutional error would be far more damaging than the majority’s statutory error, the majority’s statutory misinterpretation is the lesser of two evils...|$|R
25|$|The Opinion of the Court, {{delivered}} by <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia,</b> {{was joined by}} Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. and by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.|$|E
25|$|First, <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> {{found that}} the Court has no {{jurisdiction}} to decide the case because petitioners lack standing, which would have ended the inquiry. However, since the majority saw fit to find standing, his dissent continued.|$|E
25|$|<b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> concurred {{with the}} majority, but wrote {{separately}} {{to note that}} Ideal's alleged 1962(c) injury was not within the zone of interests protected by the RICO cause of action and so Ideal did not have standing to bring suit.|$|E
40|$|<b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia’s</b> opinion for the Court in Boyle v. United Technologies Corp. arguably {{departed}} from his usual preferences by recognizing a government contractor defense {{as a matter}} of federal common law. This Essay offers an alternative rationale for the decision in Boyle grounded in constitutional preemption, and explains why this approach is more consistent with <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia’s</b> broader methodological and constitutional commitments...|$|R

25|$|<b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the Court in which Stevens, Souter, Thomas, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined. Justice Thomas filed a concurring opinion. Justice Kennedy filed a dissenting opinion, in which Chief Justice Roberts and Breyer and Alito, JJ., joined.|$|E
25|$|<b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> {{argued that}} the Court thought the {{precedent}} established in the Gerstein case in regards to issues associated with warrantless arrests {{was more than enough}} in determining when probable cause is determined for suspects. He also {{argued that the}} court disregarded the guarantees the Fourth Amendment outlined in regards to holding people in custody. Finally, <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> argued that the Court’s further interpretation of the Gerstein case to mandate that law enforcement must determine probable cause in a set amount of time was unnecessary; he felt that it was completely unrelated to clearing arrest-related administrative affairs or assigning a judge to the suspect’s case. He also felt that the probable cause determination for suspects arrested without a warrant should be less strict.|$|E
25|$|<b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> dissented {{and said}} that he would have upheld the entire law. Justice Thomas {{likewise}} stated that he would have upheld the entire law as not preempted by federal law. Justice Alito agreed with Justices Scalia and Thomas regarding Sections 5(C) and 6, but joined with the majority in finding Section 3 preempted.|$|E

25|$|In {{his first}} term, Alito voted fairly conservatively. For example, {{in the three}} reargued cases (Garcetti v. Ceballos, Hudson v. Michigan and Kansas v. Marsh), Alito created a 5–4 {{majority}} by voting with four other conservative Justices– Chief Justice Roberts and <b>Justices</b> <b>Scalia,</b> Kennedy, and Thomas. He further voted with the conservative wing of the court on Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon and Rapanos v. United States. Alito was also a dissenter in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, alongside <b>Justices</b> <b>Scalia</b> and Thomas.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} opinion says that <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia's</b> argument concerning the jurisdiction-stripping statute (section 1005e(1)) ignores the effective date provision {{of that very}} statute (section 1005(h)).|$|R
25|$|Justice Thomas filed a concurring opinion, {{joined by}} <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia,</b> which {{mentions}} saving {{for another day}} {{the issue of whether}} Congress had sufficient power under the Commerce Clause to enact this ban. The Commerce Clause (the only Constitutional clause mentioned explicitly in any of the decision's three opinions) was also mentioned in the majority opinion.|$|E
25|$|The {{court had}} concern {{that there is}} a gray area where certain types of cases would fall through the cracks, because only the U.S. {{military}} appeared to have jurisdiction. On the other hand, <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> noted, it may be possible, and better, for Congress to remedy that situation, as they have deliberative powers the court does not.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} meaning theory, which {{is closely related}} to textualism, is the view that interpretation of a written constitution or law should be based on what reasonable persons living {{at the time of its}} adoption would have understood the ordinary meaning of the text to be. Most originalists, such as <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia,</b> are associated with that view.|$|E
5000|$|After the Supreme Court {{issued its}} opinion, analysts {{described}} Jesinoski as a [...] "landmark case" [...] in Truth in Lending Act jurisprudence.

[...] Some analysts also described <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia's</b> opinion as [...] "terse" [...] and the [...] "shortest opinion of the year" [...] with [...] "only six paragraphs of analysis." [...] Others predicted <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia's</b> textualist approach in Jesinoski would foreshadow a similar analytic approach for the Court's decision in King v. Burwell.|$|R
5000|$|Justice Stevens {{noted that}} he agreed with Justice Kennedy's {{description}} of the cases and Justice Kennedy’s critique of <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia's</b> plurality opinion. However, Justice Stevens stated he was [...] "skeptical" [...] that there actually were any adjacent wetlands that would not meet Kennedy's significant nexus test. Nevertheless, Justice Stevens clarified that because all four dissenters adopted the broadest jurisdictional test, they would also find Corps jurisdiction in any case that meets either <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia's</b> or <b>Justice</b> Kennedy's test. As such, Justice Stevens assumed Justice Kennedy's [...] "approach will be controlling in most cases." ...|$|R
25|$|On June 21, 1991, Chief Justice Rehnquist {{delivered}} {{the judgment of}} the Court, joined by Justices O'Connor and Kennedy. <b>Justices</b> <b>Scalia</b> and Souter authored their own concurring opinions, agreeing with the majority ruling but for different reasons.|$|R

25|$|Thomas {{is often}} {{described}} as an originalist, or textualist, {{and a member of the}} conservative wing of the Supreme Court. He is also often described as the most conservative member of the Supreme Court, although others gave <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> that designation. Scalia and Thomas had similar but not identical judicial philosophies, and pundits speculate about the degree to which Scalia thought some of Thomas's views are implausible.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the primary}} {{objection}} of the Court's two originalists, Justices Scalia and Thomas, was whether such a consensus was relevant. <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia</b> {{argued that the}} appropriate question was not whether there was presently a consensus against the execution of juveniles, but rather whether the execution of such defendants was considered cruel and unusual at {{the point at which}} the Bill of Rights was ratified.|$|E
40|$|In 2004, Crawford v. Washington, {{authored}} by <b>Justice</b> Antonin <b>Scalia,</b> revolutionized {{the law of}} confrontation by requiring that, aside from two discrete exceptions, all testimonial statements (those made {{with the expectation that}} they will serve to prosecute the accused) be subject to cross-examination. This new interpretation of the Sixth Amendment confrontation clause has profoundly affected domestic violence cases, making it much harder to prosecute them successfully. Although <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia’s</b> approach to confrontation is new, it is strikingly similar to the analysis in Regina v. Bedingfield, a notorious English murder case, which excluded from the evidence an alleged statement by the murder victim. The analysis of the res gestae hearsay exception, which was central to excluding the victim’s statement in Bedingfield, focused on the timing of her statement, her intent in making it, and whether an ongoing emergency existed when the declaration was made. <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia’s</b> rigid, formalistic approach to testimonial statements in Davis v. Washington, another in the line of new confrontation cases, is analogous and ultimately as confusing and unworkable as Bedingfield’s res gestae analysis. Although Bedingfield arose in 1879, its facts, replete with verbal abuse, intoxication, unheeded pleas for police protection, and ultimately, murder when the victim tried to break off the relationship, resonate with modern experiences of domestic violence. Both the Bedingfield case and <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia’s</b> confrontation jurisprudence fail to account for the practical realities of domestic violence cases and ignore the voices of victims who cannot or will not testify on their own behalf. The facts of Bedingfield, which present a serious question whether the victim’s statement was ever uttered, demonstrate another flaw in <b>Justice</b> <b>Scalia’s</b> new approach. In addition to being too rigid in rejecting unconfronted testimonial statements, the new confrontation doctrine it is also too lax regarding nontestimonial statements, which now receive no constitutional protection at all...|$|R
