5|$|On October 27 {{the company}} began buying back all its {{commercial}} paper, valued at around $3.3 billion, {{in an effort to}} calm investor fears about Enron's supply of cash. Enron financed the re-purchase by depleting its lines of credit at several banks. While the company's debt rating was still considered investment-grade, its bonds were trading at levels slightly less, making <b>future</b> <b>sales</b> problematic.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, AECL noted that each reactor sale would employ 3,600 Canadians {{and result in}} $300 million in balance-of-payments income. These sales efforts were aimed {{primarily}} at countries being run by dictatorships or similar, a fact that led to serious concerns in parliament. These efforts also led to a scandal when it was discovered millions of dollars {{had been given to}} foreign sales agents, with little or no record of who they were, or what they did to earn the money. This led to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation after questions were raised about sales efforts in Argentina, and new regulations on full disclosure of fees for <b>future</b> <b>sales.</b>|$|E
25|$|The future {{administration}} of Northern Rhodesia, a proposition of little economic viability without its southern counterpart, was a burden the Company now endeavoured to rid itself of. Negotiations between the Company and the British government produced a settlement whereby the territory {{would become a}} protectorate under Whitehall, with government transferred to the Colonial Office in London, which would henceforth appoint a local governor. The Company would concurrently keep the country's mineral rights, extensive tracts of freehold property, and half the proceeds from <b>future</b> <b>sales</b> of land in what had been North-Western Rhodesia. Northern Rhodesia duly became an Imperial protectorate on 1 April 1924, with Sir Herbert Stanley installed as the inaugural governor. British South Africa Company rule in Rhodesia was thereby ended.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, he Judicial Committee of the Privy Council {{decided in}} the Southern Rhodesia case that, even {{although}} the British South Africa Company may have conquered Mashonaland and Matabeleland, it had acted {{as an agent of}} the British Crown, so the land had become Crown land. The court recognised that the indigenous people of what became Southern Rhodesia, had previously owned the land, but had lost it through the BSAC conquest. However, even after the Privy Council decision, the British government allowed BSAC to continue to administer the unalienated lands in Southern Rhodesia and agreed that, when their Charter expired, it was to recover the loss it had incurred in administering the territory either from <b>future</b> <b>sales</b> of these lands or from the British government. In negotiations for the ending of the Charter in 1923, the British government agreed to fund part of this deficit, but placed the obligation to pay off the rest on Southern Rhodesia itself.|$|E

500|$|Many {{innovations}} {{were introduced}} or refined in the 1950s to make driving {{safer and more}} comfortable.

500|$|Sega {{argued that}} Accolade had infringed upon its {{copyrights}} because Accolade's games contained Sega's material. [...] Accolade insisted that {{their use of}} Sega's material constituted fair use. [...] However, Judge Caulfield did not accept this explanation since Accolade was a game manufacturer, their works were for financial gain, and because their works competed directly with Sega's licensed games, likely resulting in a sales decrease for Sega's games. [...] Accolade's case was further hurt by a presentation by a Sega engineer named Takeshi Nagashima, who showed two Sega game cartridges that were able to run on the Genesis III without the trademark-displaying TMSS, and offered them to Accolade's defense team but would not reveal how that was possible. [...] Ultimately, this would result in Accolade's defeat on April 3, 1992, when Judge Caulfield {{ruled in favor of}} Sega and issued an injunction prohibiting <b>future</b> <b>sales</b> by Accolade of Genesis-compatible games incorporating the Sega message or using the results of the reverse engineering. [...] Almost a week later, Accolade was also required by the court to recall all of their Genesis-compatible games.|$|E

500|$|Baen was {{replaced}} by John J. Pierce, but the situation only worsened. [...] Pierce resigned within a year: the company was in increasing debt, and his office assistant recalls that the office appeared inefficiently run, though he commented that Pierce [...] "clearly loved {{what he did and}} knew what he was talking about". [...] Pierce's replacement was Hank Stine, who took over in late 1978, though because of Galaxys irregular schedule Pierce's last issue was March–April 1979. [...] Stine managed to produce only two more issues, June–July 1979 and September–October 1979, before UPD's financial problems spelled the end. [...] Rights to the title were transferred to a new company, Galaxy Magazine, Inc., owned by Vincent McCaffrey, proprietor of Avenue Victor Hugo, a second-hand book store in Boston; UPD retained a ten percent interest in order to receive income from <b>future</b> <b>sales</b> to pay off their debts. [...] Stine had compiled two more issues, but neither ever appeared; McCaffrey, who had also launched a separate magazine, Galileo, had cash-flow problems that prevented him from distributing the magazine as he had planned. [...] One more issue did finally appear from McCaffrey, in July 1980, in a large format; it was edited by Floyd Kemske. [...] A subsequent issue, to be dated October 1980, was assembled, but never distributed.|$|E
2500|$|Though no {{explanation}} of this controversy might ever be {{recovered from the}} perspective of the record company, Jason Scheff later explained that Warner Bros. Records had endured a major internal reorganization near that time. The band and its producer said this event had suddenly injected Warner Bros. with new management personnel who doubted the album's <b>future</b> <b>sales</b> performance against the company's requirements. Scheff explained that [...] "the record label wasn't thrilled with the fact that they weren't involved ... during the making of it, plus a lot of political stuff was going on, where Warner Bros. was going through a big change, and letting some of their top executives go." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Oracle {{laid off}} 10% (about 400 people) {{of its work}} force because of {{accounting}} errors. This crisis came about because of Oracle's [...] "up-front" [...] marketing strategy, in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once. The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter, thereby increasing their bonuses. This became a problem when the <b>future</b> <b>sales</b> subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and also settled (out of court) class-action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison stated in 1992 that Oracle had made [...] "an incredible business mistake." ...|$|E

2500|$|Findings {{of fraud}} {{associated}} with Scotia trials also weighed on Horrobin's company. Goran Jamal, {{a doctor who}} had participated in developing Efamol, was found guilty of research fraud by the General Medical Council in 2003. The Council ruled that Jamal had committed [...] "serious professional misconduct for falsifying his results", manipulating the supposed randomisation of the clinical trial conducted over a decade earlier. Scotia was faulted by industry observers for what was called a [...] "highly unusual" [...] compensation scheme, as it had offered the doctor a portion of profits from <b>future</b> <b>sales,</b> although the Council suggested that Jamal was prompted to commit fraud by his [...] "belief" [...] in the efficacy of the drug and not by his desire for financial gain.|$|E
2500|$|By 1994, {{primidone}} was {{no longer}} {{one of the most}} widely used anticonvulsants. Phenytoin was still regarded as the drug of choice for partial seizures due to its long half-life and low cost; but for children, carbamazepine was seen as the best one due to phenytoin's effects on physical appearance. Topiramate was approved two years later. It, along with the others, was mainly used in patients refractory to carbamazepine and valproate. These new agents were often described as having [...] "innovative" [...] and [...] "selective" [...] mechanisms of action; in reality, most of them also worked similarly to older agents. On February 28, 1998, Élan Corporation, plc, bought the trademark and exclusive product distribution rights for Mysoline from Wyeth in Canada and the United States at a cost of $46 million and a royalty on <b>future</b> <b>sales.</b> The actual manufacture and distribution was done by Athena Neurosciences; their name appeared on a Mysoline package information sheet dated June 1998.

Williamson accuses Levene of robbing the office. Levene quickly folds and admits that he and Dave Moss were the thieves. Levene tries to bribe Williamson, offering half of his <b>future</b> <b>sales.</b> Williamson reveals that the Nyborg sale is worthless, as the couple is elderly, mentally ill and just like talking to salesmen because they're so lonely. Levene asks why Williamson wants him turned in, and why he would give him the lead in the first place. Williamson simply states he doesn't like Levene, for the years of verbal abuse, and the old man's flippant nature. [...] Roma comes back from his interrogation and Williamson goes in the back room to speak with the detective. Alone with a devastated Levene, Roma proposes the two men work together.

In the course of a press conference at the 2009 Farnborough Airshow, Alexander Fomin, Deputy Director of Russia's Federal Service for Military-Technical Co-operation, reported that Russia had not so far tabled any questions to China with regard to [...] "copying" [...] military equipment. Fomin reported that Russia handed China the licences to manufacture the aircraft and its components, including an agreement on the production of intellectual property rights. Details of intellectual property rights, however have not been disclosed, fuelling speculation about a [...] "secret" [...] contract or parts of the original contract. The licence, at least officially, did not include an aircraft carrier version- Sukhoi Su-33 nor any variant of it, such as the Shenyang J-15. At the MAKS 2009, Rosoboronexport's General Manager Anatoli Isaykin was quoted saying: [...] "Russia is going to investigate the J-11B, as a Chinese copy of the Su-27 and Sukhoi Company is partaking in the process." [...] In 2010, Rosoboronexport announced via their official website that it was in talks with the Chinese side, regarding the ongoing production of weapons that Russia considers as un-licensed.
