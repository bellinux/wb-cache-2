5|$|Body {{impressions}} of Early Carboniferous temnospondyls from Pennsylvania {{suggest that some}} terrestrial temnospondyls mated on land like some modern amphibians. They reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating in water. The presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the temnospondyls were gregarious. The <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> individual rests under the tail of another {{in what may be}} a courtship display. Internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern salamanders.|$|E

After the dismissal of Walter Mauclerk as treasurer, at first Jocelin, along with Richard Poore, the Bishop of Durham, took over many of the treasurers functions, but this did not last long, and after 1233, Jocelin no longer was involved with financial affairs. He occasionally witnessed charters, however. After the fall of Peter des Roches in April 1234, Jocelin was given control of the Wardrobe. After this, he appears less regularly in royal government, but he did witness the reconfirmation of Magna Carta in 1237.|$|E

40|$|In the Bureaucracy of the Goryeo dynasty, {{there were}} two types of {{governmental}} positions : regular and concurrent. The former had a fixed quota and rank, while that of the latter was rather flexible. An official who was appointed to a concurrent position sometimes enjoyed the preferential treatment of "standing at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> original rank" in court ceremonies. He was permitted {{to stand at the}} <b>head</b> <b>of</b> his court rank, not the rank of the concurrent position, but that of the regular position he originally had (because a concurrent position had no fixed rank originally). Concurrent positions had no fixed rank, but in the list of the official positions of the Goryeo dynasty, some concurrent positions that enjoyed the preferential treatment of "standing at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> original rank" are described as if they had a fixed rank and quota. The present writer has an assumption that the rank and quota described in Baekgwanji (the Treatise on Government Positions) of Goryeosa (the History of the Goryeo Dynasty) were that of the latter period, and that the concurrent positions, which enabled officials that held them to enjoy the preferential treatment of "standing at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> original rank" in the former period, were changed into regular positions, so they had come to have a fixed rank and quota in the latter period of the Goryeo dynasty. The attached tables prepared by the present writer to show the conditions of these concurrent positions (which enjoyed the preferential treatment of "standing at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> original rank" in the former period) will demonstrate the errors of Baekgwanji. Hence, the present writer believes that the information on the bureaucratic systems described in Baekgwanji should be carefully reexamined...|$|R

The two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity, but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency, the same for both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver. Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: {{the effect of the}} Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo.|$|E

His was the largest group, and it {{was working on the}} most challenging problem: the design of a suitable barrier through which the gas could diffuse. Another 30 scientists and technicians were working in the other five groups. Henry A. Boorse was responsible for the pumps; Booth for the cascade test units. Libby handled chemistry, Nier analytical work and Hugh C. Paxton, engineering support. The Army reorganized the research effort at Columbia, which became the Special Alloyed Materials (SAM) Laboratories. Urey was put in charge, with Dunning becoming <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of its divisions. It would remain this way until 1 March 1945, when the SAM Laboratories were taken over by Union Carbide.|$|E
5|$|In 59, the Romans {{marched to}} the south, towards Tigranocerta, Armenia's second capital city. On their way, Corbulo's men punished those who {{withstood}} or hid from them, while leniency was shown to those who surrendered. In the harsh, dry terrain of northern Mesopotamia, the army suffered from lack of provisions, especially water, {{until they reached the}} more fertile areas near Tigranocerta. During that time, a plot to murder Corbulo was uncovered and suppressed. Several Armenian nobles who had joined the Roman camp were implicated and executed. According to a story provided by Frontinus, when the Roman army arrived at Tigranocerta, they launched the severed <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the conspirators into the city. By chance, it landed right where the city council was assembled; they immediately decided to surrender the city, which was consequently spared. Shortly after, an attempt by the Parthian army under king Vologases to enter Armenia was blocked by Verulanus Severus, the commander of the auxiliaries.|$|E

Bruce was not interested he was the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of Australia's largest importing houses and thus had a serious conflict of interest with the portfolio, {{as well as being}} very busy running the affairs of that business. But he countered by stating that he might feel obliged to accept if the position of Treasurer was offered, knowing that it had already been promised to Walter Massy-Greene. To Bruce's surprise, Hughes agreed, although Massy Greene was to remain the number two in the government and Minister for Defence. Although he had only been in parliament for three years, his business background was highly desirable to Hughes, who was facing growing criticism from the pro-business wing of the party, who had become increasingly suspicious of Hughes and his interventionist approach to the economy. Influential party figures such as Senator George Pearce and the National Union has also identified Bruce as their preferred choice for the treasury.|$|E
5|$|Several parasites {{have been}} {{isolated}} from the hartebeest. These parasites regularly alternate between hartebeest and gazelles or wildebeest. Hartebeest can be infected with theileriosis due to Rhipicephalus evertsi and Theileria species. South of the Sahara, common parasites include Loewioestrus variolosus, Gedoelstia cristata and G. hassleri. The latter two species can cause serious diseases such as encephalitis. However, parasites are not always harmful – 252 larvae {{were found in the}} <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> Zambian individual without any pathogenicity.
