40|$|A digital {{ecosystem}} {{is a widespread}} type of ubiquitous computing environment comprised of ubiquitous, geographically dispersed, and heterogeneous species, technologies and services. As a subdomain of the digital <b>ecosystems,</b> digital <b>health</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are crucial for the stability and sustainable development of the {{digital ecosystem}}s. However, since the service information in the digital <b>health</b> <b>ecosystems</b> exhibits the same features {{as those in the}} digital ecosystems, it is difficult for a service consumer to precisely and quickly retrieve a service provider for a given health service request.

25|$|Coastal {{ecosystems}} {{suffer from}} a variety of anthropogenic impacts, such as large-scale eutrophication, food web alteration, runaway consumer effects, climate change, habitat destruction, and disease. Rarely do these factors act in isolated ways. Often, researchers find additive or synergistic interactions between impacts compounding the amount of ecosystem degradation. One such example is found in salt marshes in the southeastern United States. Depletion of top predators in these systems has led to snail overgrazing of salt marsh cordgrass and subsequent die-off (as explained above). However, this die-off has been linked with intense drought conditions and the resultant increases in salt and acid stress (Silliman et al. 2005). Drought stress that raises soil salinities and increases cordgrass vulnerabilities to top-down control may be a product of climate change (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman et al. 2005). Cases such as these highlight how abiotic and biotic interactions can interact to affect <b>ecosystem</b> <b>health.</b>|$|E

In order to thoroughly evaluate this framework, we implement a prototype – a Semantic Health Service Search Engine, and execute a series of experiments on the prototype using a functional testing and simulation approach...|$|R

Following severe fires, area closures may be put in place to protect the public from risks such as falling trees and landslides. Proactive fire management strategies include prescribed burns and mechanical reduction of fuel levels.

2500|$|Once {{belonging}} to the Lost River Ranch lease, the land that now comprises the Milk River Natural Area was grazed infrequently and was therefore deleted from the grazing lease under the Public Lands Act in 1978 and 1979. Some resource exploration has occurred {{over the years and}} several wells were drilled but have subsequently been abandoned. Coal was also briefly mined but due to the area's remoteness was also abandoned. The Milk River Natural Area and Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve were established with the intent [...] "to protect and maintain the ecological and aesthetic character of a representative example of the Mixed Grassland Natural Region with minimal human interference;" [...] specifically, protecting ecological diversity and processes, native species and habitats, rare and significant natural features, recreation, education, and scientific research. Management interference is intended to be minimal and [...] "let nature take its course" [...] wherever possible, while managing some ecological processes such as fires and controlled grazing. A balance of grazing regimes is important to maintain the combination of short and medium grasses defining the dry mixedgrass natural subregion. Cattle do not graze {{in the same way as}} the now-extirpated bison did, but have been used to simulate natural processes. Grazing management maintains the grassland ecosystem in its climax state, but overgrazing must be avoided to prevent soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. Rangeland health assessments aid this goal by periodically evaluating the area's <b>ecosystem</b> <b>health,</b> including measuring factors such as grazing intensity, weed occurrence, species composition, site stability, and soil and plant health.
