5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden {{building was}} constructed each year, called Dover Castle, from which gunfire salutes were sounded during the competitions. Competitors were {{summoned to the}} hillside {{by the sound of}} a <b>hunting</b> <b>horn,</b> to take part in various sports. Mounted cannons were fired to begin the events, which included horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, fighting with swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Prizes included silver trophies for the mounted sports, and perhaps also money for the other events.|$|E
5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle has closely {{associated}} with the legend of Sir Guy the Seeker since at least the early 19th century. Different versions of the story vary slightly in their details, but typically involve a knight, Sir Guy, arriving at Dunstanburgh Castle, where he was met by a wizard and led inside. There he comes across a noble lady imprisoned inside a crystal tomb and guarded by a sleeping army. The wizard offers Guy a choice of either a sword or a <b>hunting</b> <b>horn</b> to help free the lady; he incorrectly chooses the horn, which wakes the sleeping knights. Sir Guy finds himself outside Dunstanburgh Castle, and spends {{the rest of his life}} attempting to find a way back inside.|$|E

25|$|John prepares his armour {{according}} to the witch's instructions and arranges with his father that, when he has killed the worm, he will sound his <b>hunting</b> <b>horn</b> three times. On this signal, his father is to release his favourite hound {{so that it will}} run to John, who can then kill the dog and thus avoid the curse.|$|E
25|$|John Lambton then fights {{the worm}} by the river. The worm tries to crush him, {{wrapping}} him in its coils, but it cuts itself on his armour's spikes; {{the pieces of}} the worm fall into the river, and are washed away before they can join up again. Eventually, the worm is dead and John sounds his <b>hunting</b> <b>horn</b> three times.|$|E
25|$|In this outdoor hunting {{scene the}} horizon line is almost {{on top of}} the canvas. Seven people are present, along with {{numerous}} animals. A man with a <b>hunting</b> <b>horn</b> (Cor de chasse, la trompe du piqueur) {{can be seen in the}} foreground, his back turned to the viewer, with a group of hunting dogs to his right. Men on horses prepare for departure. Tension is in the air as the hunters and animals interact with one another. Another hunter on foot holds a gun in the background with a woman and child nearby and a village beyond. Spatial depth is minimized, the overall composition flattened, yet distances to the viewer are determined by the relationship of size; the further the object, the smaller in appearance. The faceting however does not partake in the size-distance relation, as one would expect. The hunting dogs to the lower right, for example, are treated with similar sized 'cubes' as the elements in the upper portions of the canvas; corresponding to the background. The <b>hunting</b> <b>horn</b> in the foreground is almost identical in size and in faceting to the trees in the distance. The same rounded shapes espouse the spherical surfaces formed by the horses heads. This serves to counter the illusion of depth; each portion of the canvas equally important in the overall composition.|$|E

The Wilis have their own motif. It is heard in the overture, in Act I when Berthe {{tells the story of the}} Wilis, and in the mad scene. It is heard again in Act II when the Wilis make their first entrance. The <b>hunting</b> <b>horn</b> motif marks sudden surprises. This motif is heard when Albrecht is exposed as a nobleman.|$|E
500|$|Zwingli enjoyed {{music and}} could play several instruments, {{including}} the violin, harp, flute, dulcimer and <b>hunting</b> <b>horn.</b> He would sometimes amuse {{the children of}} his congregation on his lute and was so well known for his playing that his enemies mocked him as [...] "the evangelical lute-player and fifer". [...] Three of Zwingli's Lieder or hymns have been preserved: the Pestlied mentioned above, an adaptation of Psalm 65 (c. 1525), and the Kappeler Lied, which {{is believed to have}} been composed during the campaign of the first war of Kappel (1529). These songs were not meant to be sung during worship services and are not identified as hymns of the Reformation, though they were published in some 16th-century hymnals.|$|E
500|$|Infantry {{units in}} 1809 {{wore a black}} polrock or [...] "Polish coat", a type of frock coat derived from a Lithuanian garment called a litewka which had six pairs of black lace {{fastenings}} down the front. A tall collar showed the regimental colour. Trousers were black with a blue stripe; footwear was black shoes with buttoned gaiters. They wore a shako on their heads, with the skull or a <b>hunting</b> <b>horn</b> badge for light infantry, also a black feather or horsehair plume. The shako, backpack and other equipment were of Austrian design and manufacture. The Sharpshooter companies wore a dark green Prussian-style coatee and a tall hat of Austrian origin with an elongated brim turned-up at one side. In the Peninsular War, the polrock {{was replaced by a}} short black koller or cavalry-style tunic. Equipment and badges of rank were of British pattern.|$|E

500|$|The villagers {{continue}} the harvest festivities, and Albrecht emerges again {{to dance with}} Giselle, who is named the Harvest Queen. Hilarion interrupts the festivities. He has discovered Albrecht's finely made sword and presents it as proof that the lovesick peasant boy is really a nobleman who is promised to another woman. Using Albrecht's <b>hunting</b> <b>horn,</b> Hilarion calls back the party of noblemen. Albrecht has no time to hide and {{has no choice but}} to greet Bathilde as his betrothed. All are shocked by the revelation, but none more than Giselle, who becomes inconsolable when faced with her lover's deception. Knowing that they can never be together, Giselle flies into a mad fit of grief in which all the tender moments she shared with [...] "Loys" [...] flash before her eyes. She begins to dance erratically, causing her weak heart to give out. She dies in Albrecht's arms. Hilarion and Albrecht turn on each other in rage before Albrecht flees the scene in misery. The curtain closes as Berthe weeps over her daughter's body.|$|E
500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Moonraker was {{composed}} by John Barry and recorded in Paris, again, as with production, marking {{a turning point}} away from the English location at CTS Studios in London. The score also marked {{a turning point in}} John Barry's output, abandoning the Kentonesque brass of his earlier Bond scores and instead scoring the film with slow, rich string passages – a trend which Barry would continue in the 1980s with scores such as Out of Africa and Somewhere in Time. For Moonraker, Barry uses {{for the first time since}} Diamonds Are Forever (1971), a piece of music called [...] "007" [...] (on track 7), and Bond smells a rat; [...] the secondary Bond theme composed by Barry which was introduced in From Russia with Love during Bond's escape with the Lektor; some classical music pieces were also included in the film. For the scene where Bond visits Drax in his chateau, Drax plays Frédéric Chopin's Prelude no. 15 in D-flat major (op. 28), [...] "Raindrop" [...] on his grand piano (although he plays in the key of D major). Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka by Johann Strauss II was featured during the hovercraft scene on the Piazza San Marco in Venice, and Tchaikovsky's [...] "Romeo and Juliet Overture" [...] was used for the scenes in Brazil in which Jaws meets Dolly following his accident. Other passages pay homage to earlier films including Richard Strauss's Also sprach Zarathustra (op. 30), associated with , with the <b>hunting</b> <b>horn</b> playing its distinctive first three notes, Elmer Bernstein's theme from The Magnificent Seven when Bond appears on horseback in gaucho clothing at MI6 headquarters in Brazil, and the alien-contacting theme from Close Encounters of the Third Kind as the key-code for a security door as mentioned previously.|$|E
500|$|The {{battalion}} had by now suffered approximately 150 casualties, {{and as such}} Frost {{took the}} decision for the battalion to retreat westwards again, with the wounded {{to be left behind}} and guarded by a small detachment; at nightfall each company would attempt to [...] make its way to the village of Massicault. On the night of 31 November/1 December, the battalion began its retreat, moving as quickly as possible, but a number of paratroopers became disorientated and were captured by German forces pursuing the battalion. By 2 December Battalion Headquarters, the Support Company and attached sappers, commanded by Frost, had reached an Arab farm, where they linked up with 'A' Company and formed a group about 200 strong; however, a large number of paratroopers were still missing. German forces soon located and surrounded Frost and his men and a fierce battle began; because the paratroopers were so low on ammunition Frost realised the farm could not be held, and during the night he led a charge through the weakest part of the German defences. Once they had broken through, Frost used his <b>hunting</b> <b>horn</b> to rally the remaining paratroopers, and they then marched for the Alliedheld town of Medjez el Bab; after stopping at one last farm for supplies, the group reached the town on 3 December and linked up with American patrols. Stragglers continued to reach Allied lines over the next few days, aided by units from the 56th Reconnaissance Regiment, but the battalion ultimately suffered sixteen officers and 250 other ranks killed, captured or wounded during the mission. Several historians have commented on the operation. Rick Atkinson has labelled the mission [...] "a foolish, wanton mistake" [...] let down by inadequate intelligence; and Peter Harclerode makes a similar argument, writing that the mission was [...] "a disastrous episode, badly planned and based on faulty intelligence." [...] For Otway, the mission [...] "suffered from a lack of information, and from a lack of adequate arrangements for a linkup between the ground forces and too lightly armed and comparatively immobile airborne troops." ...|$|E
50|$|Olifant (an {{alternate}} spelling of {{the word}} elephant) was the name applied in the Middle Ages to ivory <b>hunting</b> <b>horns</b> made from elephants' tusks. One {{of the most famous}} olifants belonged to the legendary Frankish knight Roland, protagonist of The Song of Roland.|$|R

In 2002 it established an annual [...] "Huntingdonshire Day" [...] on 25 April, the birthday of Oliver Cromwell. As the result of a campaign by the Huntingdonshire Society, the county flag of Huntingdonshire, a gold and beribboned <b>hunting</b> <b>horn</b> on a green field, was registered by the Flag Institute in June 2009.|$|E
2500|$|The flugelhorn (—also spelled fluegelhorn, flugel horn, or Flügelhorn—from German, wing horn, or flank horn [...] ) is a brass {{instrument}} {{pitched in}} B, and resembles a trumpet, {{but has a}} wider, conical bore. The instrument known today as the flugelhorn is a descendant of the valved bugle, which had been developed from a valveless <b>hunting</b> <b>horn</b> known in eighteenth-century Germany as a Flügelhorn. [...] The valved bugle provided Adolphe Sax (creator of the saxophone family) with the inspiration for his B soprano (contralto) saxhorns, on which the modern-day flugelhorn is modeled.|$|E
