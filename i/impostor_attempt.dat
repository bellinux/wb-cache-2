40|$|The {{following}} {{study will}} explore the stories which are not told – that is, it will scrutinize the process of intertextual emergence of an ultimately open story: one which has neither discernible authorship nor agenda and which remains in-the-making rather than strives to achieve closure. The paper will discuss the process in which multifaceted and multidirectional organizational stories are created, in which plots and characters exchange and ‘ending’ is defied. This lack of closure is perceived here as {{a breeding ground for}} networked meanings, which, if allowed to remain interdependent and plural, eschew the danger of a new organizational story becoming universal carrier of inflexibly established contents. Since the unifying semantic organizational frameworks (e. g. ‘success story’) may be construed as <b>impostors</b> <b>attempting</b> to ascribe both authorship and agency to a non- agentical and non-authored ‘untold story’, this study proposes one way in which multi- directedness and plurality of the story may be preserved...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{identification}} {{system is not}} limited in using an ID and personal identification number (PIN) but also in using biometriccharacteristics. One of biometric characteristics that has been widely used is fingerprint. This paper proposes a fingerprint matching algorithms using ordinal measure of DCT coefficient. The ordinal measure of DCT coefficient is generated from DCT blocks with size 8 x 8 pixels. Matching level was determined by computing the Minkowski distance between features of input fingerprint image and fingerprint images in the database. The simulations were accomplished using 128 fingerprints that have been normalized, from which as many as 1024 genuine <b>attempts</b> and 15360 <b>impostor</b> <b>attempts</b> were generated. The proposed algorithms achievedan Equal Error Rate (EER) at threshold 0. 3. At the EER, it resulted in FAR value of 0. 82 %, and FRR value of 78. 41 % respectively. The low value of FAR showed that the system wasconsiderably secure. Keyword: Discrete cosine transform False acceptence rate (FAR) False rejection rate (FRR...|$|R
40|$|Speaker {{verification}} is the biometric task of authenticating a claimed {{identity by}} means of analyzing a spoken sample of the claimant's voice. The present thesis deals with various topics related to automatic speaker verification (ASV) {{in the context of}} its commercial applications, characterized by co-operative users, user-friendly interfaces, and requirements for small amounts of enrollment and test data. A text-dependent system based on hidden Markov models (HMM) was developed and used to conduct experiments, including a comparison between visual and aural strategies for prompting claimants for randomized digit strings. It was found that aural prompts lead to more errors in spoken responses and that visually prompted utterances performed marginally better in ASV, given that enrollment data were visually prompted. High-resolution flooring techniques were proposed for variance estimation in the HMMs, but results showed no improvement over the standard method of using target-independent variances copied from a background model. These experiments were performed on Gandalf, a Swedish speaker verification telephone corpus with 86 client speakers. A complete on-site application (PER), a physical access control system securing a gate in a reverberant stairway, was implemented based on a combination of the HMM and a Gaussian mixture model based system. Users were authenticated by saying their proper name and a visually prompted, random sequence of digits after having enrolled by speaking ten utterances of the same type. An evaluation was conducted with 54 out of 56 clients who succeeded to enroll. Semi-dedicated <b>impostor</b> <b>attempts</b> were also collected. An equal error rate (EER) of 2. 4 % was found for this system based on a single attempt per session and after retraining the system on PER-specific development data. On parallel telephone data collected using a telephone version of PER, 3. 5 % EER was found with landline and around 5 % with mobile telephones. <b>Impostor</b> <b>attempts</b> in this case were same-handset attempts. Results also indicate that the distribution of false reject and false accept rates over target speakers are well described by beta distributions. A state-of-the-art commercial system was also tested on PER data with similar performance as the baseline research system. QC 2010091...|$|R

Afterwards, Bugs goes to [...] "work" [...] - performing comedy routines with Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and Daffy Duck. During the routines, Bugs takes notice of a strange pile of glowing carrots, but ignores them. The next day, Bugs wakes up and returns to work, but Elmer, Yosemite Sam, and Daffy Duck appear as poorly drawn versions of themselves, including a brief segment where Daffy Duck is animated {{in the style of}} Syncro-Vox. They possess strangely friendly attitudes, and repeatedly offer Bugs Bunny a carrot. Bugs eventually accepts and takes the carrot home with him. The carrot rips open and expels a poorly drawn version of Bugs. The <b>impostor</b> <b>attempts</b> to kill the real Bugs with an axe, and Bugs runs off screaming (but pauses to state [...] "You know something, folks? This is the scariest part of the picture."). Bugs finds tags reading [...] "Made on Planet Nudnik" [...] on the Elmer, Sam, and Daffy replacements, who have devolved into mindlessly spouting their catchphrases like a broken record. Bugs catches the impostors in a bag labeled [...] "pale stereotypes" [...] and sends it into outer space, where it gets swallowed by a black hole.

40|$|Introduction This report {{describes}} an efficient representation for accelerating rendering in architectural walkthroughs that improves on existing impostor approaches by incorporating rendered samples from multiple views {{into a single}} non-redundant mesh-based display representation. Imposter approaches based on a single textured polygon require an impractical number of textures to produce reasonable quality. Subsequent approaches[2] that include depth values can leave holes in the image, and require per pixel image warping. Textured depth meshes[1, 3] present a more compact, efficient representation, but have artifacts seen as "sheets" joining foreground and background points. The approach of Multi-Mesh <b>Impostors</b> [1] <b>attempts</b> to minimize these gaps by constructing layers of height field meshes, however the meshes are low quality, and the segmentation expensive, even for the one simplified special case implemented. 2 Portal Tapestries Portal tapestries, like the prev...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{advances}} in mobile technology, new services which benefit from the ubiquity of these devices are appearing. Some of these services require {{the identification of the}} subject since they may access private user information. In this paper, we propose to identify each user by drawing his/her handwritten signature in the air (in-airsignature). In order to assess the feasibility of an in-airsignature as a biometric feature, we have analysed the performance of several well-known patternrecognitiontechniques—Hidden Markov Models, Bayes classifiers and dynamic time warping—to cope with this problem. Each technique has been tested in the identification of the signatures of 96 individuals. Furthermore, the robustness of each method against spoofing attacks has also been analysed using six <b>impostors</b> who <b>attempted</b> to emulate every signature. The best results in both experiments have been reached by using a technique based on dynamic time warping which carries out the recognition by calculating distances to an average template extracted from several training instances. Finally, a permanence analysis has been carried out in order to assess the stability of in-airsignature over time...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} widespread adoption of mobile devices. Whereas initial popularity {{was driven by}} voice telephony services, capabilities are now broadening to allow an increasing range of data orientated services. Such services serve to extend the range of sensitive data accessible through such devices and will in turn increase the requirement for reliable authentication of users. This thesis considers the authentication requirements of mobile devices and proposes novel mechanisms to improve upon {{the current state of}} the art. The investigation begins with an examination of existing authentication techniques, and illustrates a wide range of drawbacks. A survey of end-users reveals that current methods are frequently misused and considered inconvenient, and that enhanced methods of security are consequently required. To this end, biometric approaches are identified as a potential means of overcoming the perceived constraints, offering an opportunity for security to be maintained beyond pointof- entry, in a continuous and transparent fashion. The research considers the applicability of different biometric approaches for mobile device implementation, and identifies keystroke analysis as a technique that can offer significant potential within mobile telephony. Experimental evaluations reveal the potential of the technique when applied to a Personal Identification Number (PIN), telephone number and text message, with best case equal error rates (EER) of 9 %, 8 % and 18 % respectively. In spite of the success of keystroke analysis for many users, the results demonstrate the technique is not uniformly successful across the whole of a given population. Further investigation suggests that the same will be true for other biometrics, and therefore that no single authentication technique could be relied upon to account for all the users in all interaction scenarios. As such, a novel authentication architecture is specified, which is capable of utilising the particular hardware configurations and computational capabilities of devices to provide a robust, modular and composite authentication mechanism. The approach, known as IAMS (Intelligent Authentication Management System), is capable of utilising a broad range of biometric and secret knowledge based approaches to provide a continuous confidence measure in the identity of the user. With a high confidence, users are given immediate access to sensitive services and information, whereas with lower levels of confidence, restrictions can be placed upon access to sensitive services, until subsequent reassurance of a user's identity. The novel architecture is validated through a proof-of-concept prototype. A series of test scenarios are used to illustrate how IAMS would behave, given authorised and <b>impostor</b> authentication <b>attempts.</b> The results support the use of a composite authentication approach to enable the non-intrusive authentication of users on mobile devices.
