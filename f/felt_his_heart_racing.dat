40|$|What {{abnormalities}} {{does this}} ECG show? What syndrome might this represent, {{and what are}} its implications? What is the treatment for this syndrome? A 23 -year-old fit, athletic male student was sittingin class when he suddenly <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>racing.</b> He perspired profusely and thought that he might faint. He left the class {{and ran to the}} nearby emer-gency department (ED). He felt better while running and, in the ED, felt back to his usual self. On admission to the ED, his vital signs and physi-cal examination were normal. Figure 1 shows his electrocardiogram (ECG). Due to abnormalities on the ECG, hematology, basic chemistr y, cardiac enzymes, and chest x-ray were done. Results were normal. Repeat cardiac enzyme tests after 4 hour...|$|E

60|$|Larry <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> throb, and <b>his</b> {{resolution}} failed him. He {{could see}} the girl's eyes, and their compelling tenderness.|$|R
60|$|Paul, watching, <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> {{contract}} with pain. His mother looked so small, and sallow, and done-for beside the luxuriant Clara.|$|R

60|$|There {{was another}} silence. When she spoke again, {{her voice had}} changed for the second time. Tavernake <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> sink as he listened.|$|R

60|$|He lay staring {{across at}} the wall opposite, {{as if trying to}} believe Morel was not there. Paul <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> go hard and angry.|$|R
6000|$|... "You slur them," [...] Lora said, smiling. [...] "Talk some more. I'm {{interested}} in dialects." [...] She glanced at him, white-teethed. Conger <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> constrict.|$|R

60|$|Ciccu, who by {{this time}} had hoped for a little peace, <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> sink at this fresh errand, and {{he went into the}} stable to {{complain}} to the faithful horse.|$|R
60|$|Brand <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> beating {{with more}} than the mere {{excitement}} of the moment. He yielded. She pressed a spring with her finger, and the panel rolled slowly back into its place.|$|R
6000|$|The boy <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> go thump at Anna's laugh. It {{was just}} {{as if she had}} said: [...] "Ah! but not you--surely!" [...] And he got up to follow her towards the door.|$|R
60|$|Adam {{was unable}} to speak. The strong man, {{accustomed}} to suppress the signs of sorrow, had <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> swell like a child's at this first approach of sympathy. He fell on Seth's neck and sobbed.|$|R

60|$|Tolly Trevor <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> swell with {{gratification}} at {{the idea}} of his being the chosen protector of the Rose of Oregon--the Beautiful Nugget; selected by herself, too. Nevertheless his good sense partially subdued his vanity on the point.|$|R
60|$|The speaker's grey-blue eyes, always {{laughing}} with mockery, glanced from the battleships and lit {{on the dark}} blue eyes of Siegmund. The latter <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> lift in a convulsive movement. This stranger ran so quickly to a perturbing intimacy.|$|R
6000|$|Austin gasped, and <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> beat furiously from relief, and the {{specialist}} {{waited a moment}} or two before he went on. [...] "It is evident that you had several lacerations on your lower arm--made by corroded iron, or something of the kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Will you?' The faint voice {{filtered}} to extinction. There {{was dead}} stillness. The grey-faced, sick man lay with eyes closed, more dead than death. Gerald looked away. He <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> was seared, it would perish if {{this went on}} much longer.|$|R
