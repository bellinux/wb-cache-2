5|$|The video {{opens with}} Spears {{and her friends}} in a hotel room, where a tabloid {{reporter}} on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she's often seen wearing publicly. Spears and her friends express their disagreement with the report. Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes {{a phone call to}} her bodyguard, and using a cloth to disguise the sound of her voice, coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and <b>fool</b> <b>around</b> briefly with the security cameras before going up to the main lobby. A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine {{in the middle of the}} rain. As they make their entrance, they're dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.|$|E

Collins was also unhappy that the website was not capable of warning him when he had two events scheduled at the same time. In a list of the best web-based calendar software for small businesses, Forbes ranked 30 Boxes second, after Google Calendar. They described 30 Boxes like “buying a new car with manual transmission and lots of extras—you don't just want to drive it, you want to <b>fool</b> <b>around</b> with it to see what it can do”.|$|E
25|$|Sun Yi's son, Sun Song (孫松), {{served as}} a Colonel of Trainee Archers (射聲校尉) and was made a Marquis of a Chief District (都鄉侯). Sun Song was known for being a gregarious and generous person and was the closest to Sun Quan among all of Sun Quan's younger male relatives. When Sun Song was {{stationed}} in Baqiu (巴丘), he was often reprimanded by Lu Xun, a senior Wu general and minister, for not maintaining good discipline in his unit and allowing his men to <b>fool</b> <b>around.</b> On one occasion, Lu Xun punished Sun Song's subordinates by ordering their heads to be shaved. Sun Song died in 231.|$|E

The official reason given for Whitney's departure from the show was that her character limited romantic possibilities for Captain Kirk.

Surprised and obviously disappointed, Jim makes an unwise comment that at least he didn't leave her at a high school hockey game, in reference to Pam's earlier revelation of what Roy had done on her worst date ever. Pam is clearly upset and gets up to go send some faxes, leaving it awkward between her and Jim, who tries unsuccessfully to apologize.|$|E

500|$|Far Side Virtual mainly designates a {{space in}} society, or a mode of behaving.

Afterwards, go into an Apple store and just <b>fool</b> <b>around,</b> hang out in there. Afterwards, go to Starbucks and get a gift card. They have a book there on the history of Starbucks—buy this book and go home. If you do all these things you'll understand what Far Side Virtual is — because people kind of live in it already.|$|E
500|$|As {{with another}} Prabhupada-inspired track {{that he wrote}} during this period, [...] "Living in the Material World", Harrison expresses his belief that the pursuit of fame and riches – {{particularly}} {{in the music industry}} – is meaningless. In the second verse of [...] "The Lord Loves the One", he sings: [...] "We all <b>fool</b> <b>around,</b> with objectives in mind / To become rich or famous, with our reputations signed..." [...] While author Joshua Greene compares Harrison's songs from this period to Vedic sutras, Allison specifies this verse-two message to a passage from the Katha Upanishad, which reads: [...] "Intoxicated, deluded by the glamour of riches, the childish do not see that they must pass away. They think, 'This is the world and there is no other.'" ...|$|E
500|$|According to Charles' autobiography, [...] "What'd I Say" [...] was {{accidental}} when he improvised it to {{fill time}} {{at the end of}} a concert in December 1958. He asserts that he never tested songs on audiences before recording them, but [...] "What'd I Say" [...] is an exception. Charles himself does not recall where the concert took place, but Mike Evans in Ray Charles: The Birth of Soul places the show in Brownsville, Pennsylvania. Shows were played at [...] "meal dances" [...] which typically ran four hours with a half-hour break, and would end around 1 or 2 in the morning. Charles and his orchestra had exhausted their set list after midnight, but had 12 minutes left to fill. He told the Raelettes, [...] "Listen, I'm going to <b>fool</b> <b>around</b> and y'all just follow me".|$|E

500|$|By the 1970s, while women's liberation was a {{mainstream}} term in American public discourse, no comparable movement {{existed in the}} Soviet Union, despite gender-based income inequality and a rate of additional work in the household greater than that experienced by American women. There were also double standards in social norms and expectations. [...] "A man can <b>fool</b> <b>around</b> with other women, drink, even be lackadaisical toward his job, and this is generally forgiven," [...] wrote Hedrick Smith, former Russian correspondent for The New York Times, but [...] "if a woman does the same things, she is criticized for taking a light-hearted approach toward her marriage and her work." [...] In {{an open letter to}} the country's leadership shortly before he was expelled from it in 1974, the dissident writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn pointed out the heavy burden placed on women to do the menial work in Soviet society: [...] "How can one fail to feel shame and compassion at the sight of our women carrying heavy barrows of stones for paving the street?" ...|$|E
500|$|Mitsuda {{claims to}} compose by [...] "just <b>fool</b> <b>around</b> on my keyboard" [...] {{and letting the}} melodies come to him. He also {{sometimes}} comes up with songs while asleep, including the ending theme to Chrono Trigger and [...] "Bonds of Sea and Fire" [...] from Xenogears, though his main inspiration is visual items, [...] "paintings or other things". His music is frequently minimalistic, and he has cited Minimalism as an influence. His final battle themes for Chrono Trigger and Xenogears are based on only a few chords each, with the latter containing only two. Mitsuda has listened to {{a great number of}} musical genres throughout his life, which he learned from his father, and is especially inspired by jazz music. He is also inspired by Celtic music, and has created two albums of music in that style. His soundtrack for Chrono Trigger also shows the influence of Asian music, including the sounds of Japanese shakuhachi flutes, Indian tabla drums and the sitar. He has cited Maurice Ravel, J.S. Bach, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Claude Debussy, Robert Schumann, Antonín Dvořák, and Gustav Holst as his favorite Classical composers, claiming that his modern influences are too numerous to name as he listens to so much music.|$|E

2500|$|The book's afterword, lovingly {{written by}} Taylor's son, {{reveals that the}} idea for the story came from a small news article: American {{students}} in Germany wrote home with the truth about the Nazi atrocities, a truth most Americans, including Charles Lindbergh, would not accept. Fraternity brothers thought it would be funny to send them letters making fun of Hitler, and the visiting students wrote back, [...] "Stop it. We’re in danger. These people don’t <b>fool</b> <b>around.</b> You could murder [...] by writing letters to him." [...] Thus emerged the idea of [...] "letter as weapon" [...] or [...] "murder by mail." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Jeep {{half of the}} division, however, {{remained}} the better-known and more popular brand. Chrysler latched on to the Jeep heritage and advertisements featured Lee Iacocca assured that after Chrysler took over AMC, that [...] "we won't <b>fool</b> <b>around</b> with an American institution. Jeep will stay Jeep. That's a promise." [...] Many of the long-established AMC/Jeep dealers considered the new Eagle line of passenger cars to be less profitable than their Jeep business. American Motors had phased out domestic-built rear-wheel-drive passenger cars after 1983 and their captive front-wheel-drive imports did not achieve sales successes. Thus, AMC/Jeep dealer sales and service expertise {{was focused on the}} four-wheel drive Jeeps and AMC's Eagle AWD models.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Sun Quan's {{second son}} Sun Lü, the Marquis of Jianchang, enjoyed {{watching}} duck fights {{so he had}} a small shed built {{in front of the}} main hall of his residence to stage duck fights. When Lu Xun heard about it, he reprimanded Sun Lü sternly, [...] "Marquis, you should be spending time reading the classics and enriching yourself with knowledge. Why are you doing this?" [...] Sun Lü immediately had the shed torn down. Sun Song (孫松; Sun Yi's son), the Colonel of Trainee Archers (射聲校尉), who was one of Sun Quan's favourite relatives, allowed his men to <b>fool</b> <b>around</b> in camp and did not maintain good military discipline. Lu Xun punished Sun Song's subordinates by having their heads shaved.|$|E

2500|$|Marinovich entered USC as a Fine Arts {{major and}} redshirted the 1988 season behind Rodney Peete. Already under intense {{pressure}} {{as a high school}} prospect, the combination of high expectation and the many new temptations that were prohibited under his strict upbringing soon overwhelmed him. He was torn between embracing the freedom and following his father's teachings, noting that [...] "I'm finally away from my dad telling me everything to do. And I've got to say I have taken advantage of it. Full advantage. He keeps telling me, 'Come on, you've got {{the rest of your life}} to <b>fool</b> <b>around.</b> Not now.' I know he's right.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} May 27, 1967, Rex Stout told author Dick Lochte that Orson Welles had once {{wanted to make}} a series of Nero Wolfe movies, and Stout had turned him down. Disappointed with the Nero Wolfe movies of the 1930s, Stout was leery of Nero Wolfe film and TV projects in America during his lifetime: [...] "That's something my heirs can <b>fool</b> <b>around</b> with, if they've a mind to," [...] he said. In 1976, a year after Stout's death, Paramount Television purchased the rights for the entire set of Nero Wolfe stories for Orson Welles. Paramount paid $200,000 for the TV rights to eight hours of Nero Wolfe. The producers planned to begin with an ABC-TV movie and hoped to persuade Welles to continue the role in a mini-series. Frank D. Gilroy was signed to write the television script ("The Doorbell Rang") and direct the TV movie on the assurance that Welles would star, but by April 1977 Welles had bowed out. Thayer David was cast as Wolfe in the 1977 TV movie.|$|E

[...] Upon recognizing that Maud would marry Frank whether or not she supported her, Matilda laughed and acquiesced. [...] On November 9, 1882, Maud and Frank were married by W. H. Hawley, the minister of Fayetteville Baptist Church. [...] The wedding ceremony was held in the parlor of Matilda's home, which was packed with people. [...] Many relatives and friends of Matilda attended the wedding, including Maud's three sisters and women's rights activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her husband Henry Stanton. [...] Frank's parents, Benjamin and Cynthia, and his sisters, Hattie and Mattie, also attended the wedding. [...] The parlor was so crowded that the hired string quartet had to play upstairs. [...] The local paper praised the marriage ceremony as [...] "one of equality". [...] Whereas most marriages of the era had the bride's wedding vows include a pledge to obey her husband, the local paper said [...] "the promises required of the bride [...] precisely the same as those required of the groom". [...] The couple honeymooned in Saratoga Springs, New York, whereupon they passed Thanksgiving with their relatives.|$|E
