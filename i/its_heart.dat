5|$|While diving, {{the emperor}} penguin's oxygen use is {{markedly}} reduced, as <b>its</b> <b>heart</b> rate {{is reduced to}} as low as 15–20 beats per minute and non-essential organs are shut down, thus facilitating longer dives. Its haemoglobin and myoglobin are able to bind and transport oxygen at low blood concentrations; this allows the bird to function with very low oxygen levels that would otherwise result in loss of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|As the {{commercial}} application of molecular diagnostics {{has become more}} important, so has the debate about patenting of the genetic discoveries at <b>its</b> <b>heart.</b> In 1998, the European Union's Directive 98/44/ECclarified that patents on DNA sequences were allowable. In 2010 in the US, AMP sued Myriad Genetics to challenge the latter's patents regarding two genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, which are associated with breast cancer. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court partially agreed, ruling that a naturally occurring gene sequence could not be patented.|$|E
5|$|Many {{theories}} have been advanced {{in way of}} explanation for decline of the Roman Empire, and many dates given for its fall, from the onset of its decline in the 3rd century to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Militarily, however, the Empire finally fell after first being overrun by various non-Roman peoples and then having <b>its</b> <b>heart</b> in Italy seized by Germanic troops in a revolt. The historicity and exact dates are uncertain, and some historians do not consider that the Empire fell at this point.|$|E

5|$|The snail's {{oesophageal}} gland houses symbiotic gammaproteobacteria {{from which}} the snail appears to obtain its nourishment. This species {{is considered to be}} one of the most peculiar deep-sea hydrothermal-vent gastropods, and it is the only known extant animal that incorporates iron sulfide into its skeleton (into both its sclerites and into its shell as an exoskeleton). <b>Its</b> <b>heart</b> is, proportionately speaking, unusually large for any animal: the heart comprises approximately 4% of its body volume.|$|E
5|$|When submerged, a crocodilian's {{heart rate}} slows {{down to one}} or two beats a minute, and blood flow to the muscles is reduced. When it rises and takes a breath, <b>its</b> <b>heart</b> rate speeds up in seconds, and the muscles receive newly oxygenated blood. Unlike many marine mammals, {{crocodilians}} have little myoglobin to store oxygen in their muscles. During diving, muscles are supplied with oxygen when an increasing concentration of bicarbonate ions causes haemoglobin in the blood to release oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and <b>its</b> <b>heart</b> rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E

5|$|By {{reading the}} book, Gray learns that Léone {{is a victim}} of a Vampyr. Vampyrs can force humans into submission. The village doctor visits Léone at the manor, and Gray recognizes him as the old man he saw in the castle. The doctor tells Gray that a blood {{transfusion}} is needed and Gray offers his blood to save Léone. Exhausted from blood loss, Gray sleeps. He wakes sensing danger and rushes to Léone, where he surprises the doctor as he is attempting to poison the girl. The doctor flees the manor, and Gray finds that Gisèle is gone. Gray follows the doctor back to the castle, where Gray has a vision of himself being buried alive. After the vision subsides, he rescues Gisèle but the doctor escapes. The old servant of the manor finds Gray's Vampyr book and discovers that a Vampyr can be defeated by driving an iron bar through <b>its</b> <b>heart.</b> The servant meets Gray at Marguerite Chopin's grave behind the village Chapel. They open the grave and find the old woman perfectly preserved. They hammer a large metal bar through her heart, killing her. The village doctor is hiding in an old mill, but finds himself locked in a chamber where flour sacks are filled. The old servant arrives and activates the mill's machinery, filling the chamber with flour and suffocating the doctor. The curse of the Vampyr is lifted and Léone suddenly recovers. Gisèle and Gray cross a foggy river by boat and find themselves in a bright clearing.|$|E
5|$|In 19th Century Russia, Vladimir Durfe (Mark Damon) {{is a young}} nobleman {{who finds}} a {{beheaded}} corpse with a knife plunged into <b>its</b> <b>heart.</b> He takes the blade, and finds shelter in a small cottage. Durfe is approached by Giorgio (Glauco Onorato) who explains that the knife belongs to his father, {{who has not been}} seen for five days. Giorgio offers a room to Durfe and introduces him {{to the rest of the}} family: his wife (Rika Dialina), their young son Ivan, Giorgio's younger brother Pietro (Massimo Righi), and sister Sdenka (Susy Andersen). They all await the return of Gorca, who has gone to fight the wurdalak, a living cadaver who feeds on human blood, especially of close friends and family members. At midnight, Gorca (Boris Karloff) returns to the cottage with a sour demeanor and unkempt appearance. After the family goes to sleep, Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorca who flees the cottage with Ivan. Giorgio chases after Gorca but only returns with Ivan's corpse. Giorgio plans to stake and behead Ivan to prevent him from reviving as a Wurdalak, but is prevented from doing so by his wife. The two agree to give their son a burial.|$|E

Vordenburg, an authority on vampires, has discovered that his ancestor was romantically involved with the Countess Karnstein before she died {{and became one of}} the undead. Using his forefather's notes, he locates Mircalla's hidden tomb. An Imperial Commission exhumes the vampire's body. Immersed in blood, it seems to be breathing faintly, <b>its</b> <b>heart</b> beating, its eyes open. A stake is driven through <b>its</b> <b>heart,</b> and it gives a corresponding shriek; then the head is struck off. The body and head are burned to ashes, which are thrown into a river.|$|E

25|$|The term {{heartwood}} derives {{solely from}} its position {{and not from}} any vital importance to the tree. This {{is evidenced by the}} fact that a tree can thrive with <b>its</b> <b>heart</b> completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras, while in maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, thick sapwood is the rule. Others never form heartwood.|$|E
