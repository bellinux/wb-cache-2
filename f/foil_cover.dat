5|$|On December 17, 2007 it was {{announced}} that Crisis Core would be released in North America on March 25, 2008. If pre-ordered from certain retailers, such as GameStop, the buyer may receive a Shinra UMD case, depending on how long supplies lasted; if pre-ordered from Best Buy, the buyer may receive Crisis Core with a metallic <b>foil</b> <b>cover.</b> Two versions of the game were released in Europe: a standard edition, and a limited edition, which was only available online, and then only when pre-ordered. This limited edition included special slipcase packaging and a book of promotional CG artwork entitled The Art of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII. In Europe, a bundle containing the game and the limited edition Crisis Core-engraved silver PlayStation Portable was released on June 20. As with several games from the company, Square released an Ultimania guidebook in Japan, on October 18, 2007.|$|E

25|$|The sanctum has two floors. The Sikh Scripture Guru Granth Sahib {{is seated}} on the lower square floor for about 20 hours everyday, and for 4 hours it is taken to its bedroom inside Akal Takht with {{elaborate}} ceremonies in a palki, for sukhasana and prakash. The floor with the seated scripture is raised a few steps above the entrance causeway level. The upper floor in the sanctum is a gallery and connected by stairs. The ground floor is lined with white marble, as is the path surrounding the sanctum. The sanctum's exterior has gilded copper plates. The doors are gold <b>foil</b> <b>covered</b> copper sheets with nature motifs such as birds and flowers. The ceiling of the upper floor is gilded, embossed and decorated with jewels.

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{deposition of}} thin organic dielectric films on metallized carrier foils by glow discharge in monomeric gases is described. Depending on the applied monomers, the films had a dissipation factor of. 001 to. 003 (1 kHz), a relative permittivity of 2. 3 to 2. 5 and a resistivity of about 10 to the 17 th power omega cm.

50|$|Punchboards were {{originally}} {{used in the}} 18th century for gambling purposes. A local tavern owner would construct a game board out of wood, drill small holes in it, and fill each hole with a small paper ticket or gamepiece. The holes were then typically covered with paper or foil. After a patron bought a chance at the punchboard, he would puncture one of the hole's paper or <b>foil</b> <b>covers</b> with a nail and retrieve the ticket/gamepiece. If the gamepiece contained a winning number, the patron won the prize.|$|R
50|$|Putting {{a baking}} sheet pan over a furnace can allow for baking, which is in turn derived from {{the concept of the}} masonry oven. This was common for centuries, used to make breads, pies, and other items, and is still popular today, {{particularly}} among campers who enjoy stuffing their meats. Ovens can be made from cast iron, sheet metal or aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>covered</b> cardboard box. Reflector ovens are metal containers designed to surround an article of food being baked over an open flame and reflect the heat back towards the food.|$|R

The task was to control a virtual robot hand removing a thin <b>foil</b> <b>cover</b> from a satellite in an on-orbit servicing training simulator.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{morphology}} of the oxide scale formed at 850 ◦C on the foil surface of FeCrAl steel is described. Two types of samples have been used: one covered with an Al nano-layer {{and the second}} without. Microscopic observations of the cross-sections of scales have demonstrated {{that in the case}} of foil without Al nano-layer there is a remnant of an amorphous Al 2 O 3 nano-layer, from which γ and θ crystallites of Al 2 O 3 have been grown.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{advanced}} oxidation process / heterogeneous photocatalytic process (UV/TiO 2 /Fenton) system was investigated {{to the treatment}} of oily wastewater. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of hydrogen peroxide concentration H 2 O 2, initial amount of the iron catalyst Fe+ 2, pH, temperature, amount of TiO 2 and the concentration of oil in the wastewater. The removal efficiency for the system UV/TiO 2 /Fenton at optimal conditions and dosage (H 2 O 2 = 400 mg/L, Fe+ 2 = 40 mg/L, pH= 5, temperature = 30 oC, TiO 2 = 75 mg/L) for 1000 mg/L load was found to be 77 %. Aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>cover</b> around the reactor and air bubbling were utilized in the experiments of photo Fenton UV/ H 2 O 2 /Fe+ 2 homogeneous and heterogeneous systems in order to improve the removal efficiency. The removal efficiency was improved to 81 % for UV/TiO 2 /Fenton system. The reaction was found to be of a first order throughout the systems...|$|E
40|$|Carrots (D. carota L.) are root {{vegetable}} {{and the source}} of carotenoids. Careless handling during post-harvest such letting carrots exposed to sunlight leads to damage in carrots. Those effects can be reduced by covering treatment. This study aimed to determine the interaction between cover type and duration of sun exposure on the wet weight, carotenoids and vitamin A content of carrots. Local carrot cultivar in Sidomukti Village, Bandungan, Semarang were studied. The study conducted at the Laboratory of Plant Physiology, FSM, Diponegoro University. The experiment was laid out in Complete Randomized Design (factorial) with two factors: cover type (P) and duration of sun exposure (T). Data were analyzed for ANOVA, followed by Duncan's test (95 % confidence level). Wet weight, carotenoids and vitamin A content were recorded. The results showed the cover type and duration of sun exposure influence the wet weight, carotenoids and vitamin A content of carrots. Duncan test results showed significant differences. Losses can be reduced by aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>cover</b> and not exposed carrots to sunlight. Impenetrable cover should be used and exposure to the sun should be avoided for more than 6 hours after harvest to enhance carrot qualities retention...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} spaceflight factors on {{the seeds of}} Arabidopsis thaliana and Crepis capillaris were studied {{provided}} with various protective measures: the seeds were located inside the satellite and in open space, protected with aluminium foil and also exposed without the <b>foil</b> <b>cover.</b> When the seeds were in open space without any protection, their viability {{was found to be}} suppressed; the survival rate and fertility of plants grown from these seeds were also diminished. An increase in the frequency of chromosome aberrations (CA) and in the number of multiple injuries was registered in this case. Experiments with the aluminium foil shielding showed a decrease in the suppression of the seeds' viability, but mutational changes were found to be even more increased, while the survival and fertility of the plants decreased. An increase in the thickness of shielding resulted in a decrease in the effects up {{to the level of the}} control, except for the effects connected with CA and fertility of the plants. Analysis of the results shows that these impairments can be ascribed to the action of single heavy charged particles (HCP). The seeds can be thus regarded as an integral biological 'dosimeter' which allows estimation of the total effects of radiation, ecological and biological factors...|$|E

5000|$|Publishers {{responded by}} {{manufacturing}} collectors’ items, such as trading cards, and “limited editions” of certain issues featuring a special or variant cover. The first issues of Marvel Comics' X-Force, X-Men vol. 2, and Spider-Man became {{some of the}} first and most notorious examples of this trend. Another trend which emerged was foil-stamped covers. The first Marvel comic book with a foil-stamped cover was the third volume of the Silver Surfer, issue 50 (June 1991). A glow-in-the-dark cover for Ghost Rider, volume 3, issue 15 appeared as well. This led a market boom, where retail shops and publishers made huge profits and many companies, large and small, expanded their lines.

30|$|The {{synthesis}} {{process of}} TiO 2 nanowire networks on Ti foil {{is referred to}} [28, 29]. Briefly, a piece of Ti foil with a dimension of 1.5  ×  3.0  cm ×  0.127  mm (Sigma Aldrich) was ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, isopropanol and Milli-Q water for 10  min in sequence and then placed {{against the wall of}} a 125  mL Teflon-lined stainless steel antoclave filled with 40  mL of 1  M NaOH aqueous solution. Then, the sealed autoclave was put into an oven at a temperature of 220  °C for 20  h. Next the Ti <b>foil</b> <b>covered</b> with nanowires was taken out of the autoclave and immersed in 50  mL of 0.6  M HCl solution for 1  h to exchange Na+ with H+. Finally, the foil was annealed inside a furnace at 500  °C for 3  h in air to transform the H 2 Ti 2 O 5 ·H 2 O nanowires to anatase nanowires. The color of the foil turned white after the calcination process.|$|R
