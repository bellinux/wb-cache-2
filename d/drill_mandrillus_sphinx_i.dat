40|$|Recent {{serological}} {{and molecular}} surveys of different primate species allowed {{the characterization of}} several Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) homologues in macaques, African green monkeys, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Identification of these new primate rhadinoviruses revealed the existence of two distinct genogroups, called RV 1 and RV 2. Using a degenerate consensus primer PCR method for the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene, the presence of KSHV homologues has been investigated in two semi-free-ranging colonies of eight <b>drill</b> (<b>Mandrillus</b> leucophaeus), five mandrill (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>sphinx),</b> and two hybrid (<b>Mandrillus</b> leucophaeus-Mandrillus <b>sphinx)</b> monkeys, living in Cameroon and Gabon, Central Africa. This search revealed the existence of not only two distinct KSHV homologues, each one belonging {{to one of the}} two rhadinovirus genogroups, but also of two new betaherpesvirus sequences, one being close to cytomegaloviruses and the other being related to human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV- 6 and - 7). The latter viruses are the first simian HHV- 6 and - 7 homologues identified to date. These data show that mandrill and drill monkeys are the hosts of at least four novel distinct herpesviruses. Moreover, mandrills, like macaques and African green monkeys, harbor also two distinct gamma- 2 herpesviruses, thus strongly suggesting that a second gamma- 2 herpesvirus, belonging to the RV 2 genogroup, may exist in humans...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>sphinx,</b> a large primate {{living in}} Cameroon and Gabon and {{belonging}} to the Papionini tribe, {{was reported to be}} infected by a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (SIVmndGB 1) as early as 1988. Here, we have identified a second, highly divergent SIVmnd (designated SIVmnd- 2). Genomic organization differs between the two viral types; SIVmnd- 2 has the additional vpx gene, like other SIVs naturally infecting the Papionini tribe (SIVsm and SIVrcm) and in contrast to the other SIVmnd type (here designated SIVmnd- 1), which is more closely related to SIVs infecting l'hoest (Cercopithecus lhoesti lhoesti) and sun-tailed (Cercopithecus lhoesti solatus) monkeys. Importantly, our epidemiological studies indicate a high prevalence of both types of SIVmnd; all 10 sexually mature wild-living monkeys and 3 out of 17 wild-born juveniles tested were infected. The geographic distribution of SIVmnd seems to be distinct for the two types: SIVmnd- 1 viruses were exclusively identified in mandrills from central and southern Gabon, whereas SIVmnd- 2 viruses were identified in monkeys from northern and western Gabon, as well as in Cameroon. SIVmnd- 2 full-length sequence analysis, together with analysis of partial sequences from SIVmnd- 1 and SIVmnd- 2 from wild-born or wild-living mandrills, shows that the gag and pol regions of SIVmnd- 2 are closest to those of SIVrcm, isolated from red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus), while the env gene is closest to that of SIVmnd- 1. pol and env sequence analyses of SIV from a related Papionini species, the <b>drill</b> (<b>Mandrillus</b> leucophaeus), shows a closer relationship of SIVdrl to SIVmnd- 2 than to SIVmnd- 1. Epidemiological surveys of human immunodeficiency virus revealed a case in Cameroon of a human infected by a virus serologically related to SIVmnd, raising the possibility that mandrills represent a viral reservoir for humans similar to sooty mangabeys in Western Africa and chimpanzees in Central Africa...|$|R

The first half of the survey was conducted in the Regions of Niari and Lekoumou. In this area, the occurrence of Pan t. troglodytes and Cercopithecus pogonias was confirmed by direct observations. The occurrence of Gorilla g. gorilla, <b>Mandrillus</b> <b>sphinx,</b> Cercopithecus cephus and C. nictitans was confirmed by the indirect evidence. Local people informed me of the presence of Cercocebus albigena, C. torquatus and Miopithecus talapoin, although they were not confirmed directly. The second half of the survey was carried out at Dimonika in the Region of Kouilou. Pan t. troglodytes and Cercopithecus cephus were directly observed.

40|$|<b>Drills</b> (<b>Mandrillus</b> leucophaeus) are an {{endangered}} species of African monkey (Cercopithecidae), and their sole congener the mandrill (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>sphinx)</b> is vulnerable to extinction. Both species are threatened in the wild by deforestation and hunting. Drills have a poor record of captive reproduction. Many individuals appear to have behavioral deficiencies which interfere with reproduction. Thus, the zoo population of drills does not serve as a “hedge” against the species’ total extinction: drills are endangered in captivity {{as well as in}} the wild. Mandrills, by contrast, reproduce well in captivity. Information on the behavior of mandrills in captivity may help zoo managers improve husbandry for both species. The intent of this research was to study the relationship between aspects of the captive environment and behaviors which lead to reproduction. A review of the literature on both drills and mandrills, in the wild and captivity, was used to suggest “essential characteristics” of the captive environment that may encourage animals of both species to engage in natural, active behaviors, to form cohesive dyads with opposite-sex adults, to develop affiliative bonds, and to engage in sexual behavior. Sixty-two drills and mandrills in 14 groups in the U. S. and Germany were studied with behavior sampling methods, using the Drill Species Survival Plan ethogram. Data were analyzed by multiple regression using transformed variables. No over-all species differences in behavior were found. Results suggested that two factors promoted natural activity: 1) environmental enrichment which provides positive reinforcement for active behaviors, and 2) an affiliative husbandry style by the animal’s keepers. Active animals were more likely to engage in social behaviors leading to copulation. Many of the non-reproducing drills appeared to be “passive and withdrawn,” and shared a constellation of signs that appeared to be analogous to human clinical depression. An etiological model for “passive and withdrawn” Mandrillus, based on biobehavioral theories of human depressive disorders, was developed to link early rearing conditions and environmental enrichment. This model was then used to develop a historic-demographic hypothesis for why mandrills have historically had greater reproductive success than drills in zoos...|$|R

Male mandrills also possess a yellow beard, nuchal crest of hair, and pronounced boney paranasal ridges, all of which are absent or vestigial in females.

50|$|Limiting {{access to}} {{reproductive}} partners through mate guarding {{is a form}} of reproductive suppression. In the banded mongoose (Mungus mungo) the oldest males have the most offspring. Yet mating in this species is highly promiscuous. The older males increase their reproductive success by mate guarding the oldest most fertile females since they cannot guard all the females in the group. Therefore, successfully breeding older males are highly selective in their mate guarding and exert mate selection. Mate guarding is also a mechanism of reproductive suppression of subordinates in mandrills (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>sphinx)</b> in which males over the age of 8 mate-guard, with alpha males performing 94% of the mate-guarding and being responsible for siring 69% of the offspring.|$|R

Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted post-conflict and matched control observations on a captive group of mandrills (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>sphinx).</b> We found that victims often redirected aggression to bystanders, that they received most affiliation from those bystanders that were frequently the target of redirection, and that bystander affiliation reduced the likelihood of redirection. Bystander affiliation did not reduce the victim 2 ̆ 7 s distress (as measured by its scratching rates) and was not received primarily from kin/friends.

40|$|SummaryRed facial {{coloration}} is {{an important}} social cue in many primate species, including humans. In such species, the vasodilatory effects of estradiol may cause red facial coloration to change systematically during females’ ovarian cycle. Although increased red facial coloration during estrus has been observed in female mandrills (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>sphinx)</b> and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), evidence linking primate facial color changes directly to changes in measured estradiol is lacking. Addressing this issue, we used a longitudinal design to demonstrate that red facial coloration tracks within-subject changes in women's estradiol, but not within-subject changes in women's progesterone or estradiol-to-progesterone ratio. Moreover, the relationship between estradiol and facial redness was observed in two independent samples of women (N= 50 and N= 65). Our results suggest that changes in facial coloration may provide cues of women's fertility and present the first evidence for a direct link between estradiol and female facial redness in a primate species...|$|R
40|$|Two {{isolates}} of simian retrovirus {{related to}} the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were obtained from apparently healthy mandrills, Papio (<b>Mandrillus)</b> <b>sphinx,</b> in western equatorial Africa. This virus, designated SIVMND (simian immunodeficiency virus from mandrills), appeared morphologically similar to HIV by electron microscopy, showed Mg 2 +-dependent reverse transcriptase activity, and induced cytopathic effect in human CD 4 -positive cells. Western blotting (immunoblotting) analyses revealed that the gag and pol products of SIVMND showed cross-reactivity with those of known HIVs and SIVs. Molecular clones covering full-length viral DNA were obtained from closed circular extrachromosomal DNA of SIVMND-infected cells. By clone-on-clone hybridization with known retroviruses of the HIV and SIV groups, SIVMND showed similar cross-hybridization with HIV- 1, HIV- 2, SIVAGM (African green monkey-derived SIV), and SIVMAC (rhesus macaque-derived SIV) in the gag and pol regions only at low stringency but not at high stringency, a result indicating that SIVMND is a new member of the HIV-SIV group.
