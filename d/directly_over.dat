Sporadic moderate to heavy rainfall was recorded in both California and the states of the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
5|$|During a 19 May 1991 {{air show}} at Fairchild, Holland was the command pilot of the B-52 aerial-demonstration flight. During the demonstration, Holland's {{aircraft}} violated several safety regulations, including exceeding bank and pitch limits, flying <b>directly</b> <b>over</b> the air-show spectators, and possibly violating altitude restrictions. The base and wing commander, Colonel Arne Weinman, {{along with his}} staff, observed the demonstration, but apparently took no action.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on Cassini {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} liquid ethane beyond doubt in Ontario Lacus. On December 21, 2008, Cassini passed <b>directly</b> <b>over</b> Ontario Lacus and observed specular reflection in radar. The strength of the reflection saturated the probe's receiver, indicating that the lake level did not vary by more than 3mm (implying either that surface winds were minimal, or the lake's hydrocarbon fluid is viscous).|$|E

5|$|Like {{its parent}} Jeep Wrangler, the Storm {{is first and}} {{foremost}} an airmobile, capable offroad and utility vehicle meant to tackle extreme terrain in a general reconnaissance role, and can be outfitted with a machine gun or other weapons systems. When armed with a 105mm (4.1in) M40 recoilless rifle, the vehicle is uniquely capable of firing <b>directly</b> <b>over</b> its blast guard equipped hood rather than in the perpendicular position required by most other vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The local bedrock {{is a hard}} red sandstone, {{which the}} {{inhabitants}} used {{in the construction of}} monuments and architecture. This local sandstone is very strong and not prone to shearing or fracturing, allowing the sculptors at Quiriguá to erect the tallest freestanding stone monuments in the Americas. Quiriguá was built <b>directly</b> <b>over</b> the Motagua Fault and the city suffered damage in ancient times as a result of major earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} locks and bridges in Hungerford, {{including}} one which carries the A338. Hungerford Marsh Lock is unique on the Kennet and Avon Canal {{in that it}} has a swing bridge <b>directly</b> <b>over</b> the centre of the lock that must be opened before the lock may be used. In the area around the lock, called Hungerford Marsh Nature Reserve, more than 120 bird species have been recorded.|$|E

5|$|West of Haiti, the {{hurricane}} brought hurricane-force winds to Cuba. A fisherman {{on the eastern}} tip of Cuba was killed by rough seas while trying to secure his boats. Since {{the hurricane}} passed largely east of the Bahamas, only minor damage was reported there. Hazel passed <b>directly</b> <b>over</b> Inagua, where it claimed six lives when a sailboat capsized while taking shelter from the storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} ridge {{over the}} central Atlantic steered the nascent storm westward toward the Lesser Antilles. Thunderstorm activity was strong near the center, although initially somewhat disorganized and asymmetric. However, a tight inner core soon took shape, and Gonzalo began to quickly intensify {{throughout the day}} on October 12. Following the appearance of an eye feature early the next day, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane while located near Antigua in the eastern Caribbean. Shortly thereafter, the storm passed <b>directly</b> <b>over</b> the island. The hurricane later struck Saint Martin and Anguilla, and skirted {{just north of the}} British Virgin Islands while continuing to intensify. By that time, it was headed toward the northwest around the periphery of the aforementioned ridge.|$|E
5|$|Amara was {{initially}} expected to track <b>directly</b> <b>over</b> {{the island of}} Rodrigues, prompting widespread precautionary measures and resulting in the issuance of a Class4 warning– denoting a warning of highest urgency– by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed {{to the east of}} the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect the island. Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152km/h (94mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal sheeting and uprooting of trees. Widespread power outage cut power to 12,000homes and shut off communications to and from the island. Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion.|$|E

5|$|At one point, Monica was {{forecast}} to pass <b>directly</b> <b>over</b> Goulburn Island. In response, officials evacuated the island's 337 {{residents to}} shelters {{set up in}} Pine Creek. Numerous schools in the threatened region, especially in Darwin, were closed ahead of Monica's arrival. Several shelters were opened in Darwin early on 24 April in anticipation of an influx of evacuees. Stores throughout the area reported increased sales for storm supplies, with some reducing prices on specific items. The same day, the Darwin Returned and Services League of Australia cancelled all ANZAC Day services and marches in Darwin that were to be held the next day, {{to ensure the safety}} of prospective participants.|$|E
5|$|By 1200UTC on February14, Nancy {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity with winds of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 935hPa (mbar). Shortly after, the JTWC assessed Nancy to have peaked with winds of 230km/h (145mph 1-minute winds). Increasing forward motion {{to the southeast}} and increasing wind shear caused Nancy to weaken. Early on February15, the storm passed <b>directly</b> <b>over</b> Manuae. Continued weakening took place as a trough approached from the southwest. By February16, Nancy weakened below hurricane intensity {{and turned to the}} southwest as it began to undergo a Fujiwhara interaction with Cyclone Olaf to the north.|$|E
5|$|By midday on September24, {{the system}} became {{embedded}} within the mid-latitude westerlies and rapidly accelerated towards the northeast. The National Hurricane Center anticipated that Emily would undergo an extratropical transition within 24hours {{at this point}} as they forecast it to merge with the frontal system to the northeast. However, the storm unexpectedly underwent a second phase of rapid intensification on September25, at one point reaching the rate of explosive intensification with the central pressure decreasing at 2.5mbar per hour. By 0600UTC, Emily had re-attained hurricane intensity and at 1145UTC, the center passed <b>directly</b> <b>over</b> Bermuda with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Soon after, the storm reached its secondary peak intensity with winds of 90mph (150km/h) and a minimum pressure of 974mbar (hPa; 28.76inHg).|$|E

5|$|Damage was {{widespread}} in the Philippines, particularly in Metro Manila, where the typhoon passed almost <b>directly</b> <b>over.</b> Power and water was lost in several provinces, while overflowing rivers caused flooding, landslides and made roads impassable. In {{some parts of the}} country, electricity was cut off for up to six days straight. Many trees and billboards were toppled by Xangsane, while Luzon suffered an island-wide power outage. Rough waters and seaport closures left at least 3,400people and nearly 270 vehicles stranded in ports and terminals, mainly at the primary ferry crossing between Samar Island and Bicol Region. Local and provincial officials described Xangsane as the worst typhoon to directly impact Manila since Typhoon Angela passed over the city eleven years ago.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day on}} August9, Arlene passed <b>directly</b> <b>over</b> Bermuda with {{winds of}} 85mph (140km/h). The storm {{continued}} to intensify after passing the island, with reconnaissance recorded a minimum pressure of 969mbar (hPa; 28.61inHg) and maximum winds reached 105mph (160km/h). The hurricane began to weaken hours later, with winds decreasing below 100mph (155km/h) by the afternoon of August10. Shortly after, Arlene transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, while maintaining hurricane-force winds, over the north Atlantic. The remnants were absorbed by a larger cyclone near Newfoundland on August11.|$|E
