50|$|The Maserati 228 (Tipo AM334) was a two-door, 5-seater GT coupé {{based on}} the Biturbo chassis. It was {{conceived}} {{to fill the void}} left in the Maserati range by the departed Kyalami, and was therefore aimed at the same market of the large GTs of the past like the 3500 GT and Mexico.To accomplish this it was {{based on the}} longer wheelbase chassis (2.6 m) of the four-door Biturbos, and powered by the largest, 2.8 litre, 18-valve fuel injected V6 (hence the name 228 - 2-door, 2.8 L engine). Bilstein <b>gas</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> replaced the usual hydraulic ones, and a 4-speed automatic transmission was available on order. The notchback coupé bodywork was styled by Pierangelo Andreani, and the car was wider and longer than the two-door Biturbos, with no common body panels; the interior was also more luxuriously appointed.Maserati declared the European-specification 228 could accelerate to 0 - 100 km/h in 5.6 seconds and reach a top speed of 235 km/h.A 24-valve but still carbureted prototype was shown in December 1984; the production 228 was introduced at the 1986 Turin Motor Show, and 469 examples were made until 1992.|$|R
5000|$|Variously {{known as}} a [...] "gas cell two-tube" [...] or similarly-named design, this {{variation}} represented a significant advancement over the basic twin-tube form. Its overall structure {{is very similar to}} the twin-tube, but a low-pressure charge of nitrogen gas is added to the reserve tube. The result of this alteration is a dramatic reduction in [...] "foaming" [...] or [...] "aeration", the undesirable outcome of a twin-tube overheating and failing which presents as foaming hydraulic fluid dripping out of the assembly. Twin-tube <b>gas</b> charged <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> represent the vast majority of original modern vehicle suspensions installations.|$|R

Customers could also {{choose from a}} range of radios and speakers. One of the most eye catching options, featured {{for the first time on}} an Opel Rekord, was air conditioning, but for this feature the price was provided only [...] "on application". [...] The very small number of Rekord E1s delivered with air-conditioning suggests that the prices quoted were very high, and that air-conditioning was more a marker for Opels future than a realistic option for Rekord customers in 1980.|$|R
50|$|The GTS {{of early}} 1990 was a limited run of 510 units for the New Zealand market.

The front suspension geometry was also modified to lower ride height by 35 mm for improved road handling. Inside, the car had power windows, central locking, electric antenna and four speaker radio cassette sound system. Suggested retail was $35,995 GTS and $37,295 GTS for the manual and automatic versions, respectively. It was available painted Vivid White or GTS Blue metallic (in Australia, Alpine White or Imperial Blue).|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> able to recuperate from energy chassis {{vibrations}} has been presented in the article.

The changes for values of dynamic parameters during operation of the new <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> components have been estimated using published data. The analysis of dynamics for the <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> operating in road conditions has been based on this data. Such analysis has allowed checking the operation correctness of the new design from both the <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> and the electric generator point of view.
