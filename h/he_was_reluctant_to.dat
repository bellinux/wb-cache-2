5|$|King {{supported}} {{the ideals of}} democratic socialism, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> speak directly of this support due to the anti-communist sentiment being projected throughout the United States at the time, and the association of socialism with communism. King believed that capitalism could not adequately provide the basic necessities of many American people, particularly the African-American community.|$|E
5|$|On May 16, 1775, Montgomery {{was elected}} {{as one of}} the ten deputies to {{represent}} Dutchess County in the New York Provincial Congress. Although Montgomery had only lived in New York for two years and had not sought political involvement, he was well known and respected in the area and he felt obliged to attend. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> go, but nonetheless went to New York City, 80 miles south of Rhinebeck.|$|E

5|$|Van Gogh {{created more}} than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889. They were usually {{completed}} in series, {{such as those}} painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death. Generally the portraits were studies, created during introspective periods when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> mix with others, or when he lacked models, and so painted himself.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he claimed}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> enter politics, Hugh Mason {{became the first}} Liberal elected {{councillor}} for Ashton-under-Lyne in November 1856. He represented the Portland Place ward from 1856 until his retirement from politics in 1874. Mason quickly made an impression and was elected mayor for three consecutive years between 1857 and 1860, which had never happened before. He supported progressive measures such as opening a public park, providing public libraries, and addressing unsanitary conditions in parts of Ashton-under-Lyne.|$|E
5|$|Although many Canadians {{have come}} to view Brock {{as one of their}} own, Brock never really felt at home in Canada. On the whole, he viewed the country as a backwater, and earnestly wished to return to Europe to fight against Napoleon. Brock mistrusted the Canadian colonists, many of whom he {{suspected}} of being American sympathizers, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> arm them indiscriminately to help defend the colonies. He favoured expansion of volunteer forces which could be trained and supervised, as well as the use of British regulars and Tecumseh's warriors.|$|E

5|$|Terry Pratchett {{was pleased}} with the 1986 {{interactive}} fiction game The Colour of Magic, but criticised its poor marketing. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> grant Discworld licences due to concern for the series, and wanted a reputable company who cared about the property. Other video game companies had previously approached Pratchett seeking a licence. One such company was AdventureSoft, and their failure to obtain a Discworld licence {{led to the creation of}} Simon the Sorcerer, which took inspiration from the Discworld series of books.|$|E
5|$|Grimsby's ageing {{team made}} a bright start in 1952–53 with five {{straight}} wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board {{could not give}} him money to buy new players. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board's lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, {{he said that he}} and his wife were feeling homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted to the challenge partly because they would be closer to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt was {{receiving}} many letters from supporters {{urging him to}} run, and Republican office-holders were organizing on his behalf. Balked on many policies by an unwilling Congress and courts in his full term in the White House, he saw manifestations of public support he believed would sweep him to the White House with a mandate for progressive policies that would brook no opposition. In February, Roosevelt announced he would accept the Republican nomination if it was offered to him. Taft felt that if he lost in November, {{it would be a}} repudiation of the party, but if he lost renomination, it would be a rejection of himself. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> oppose Roosevelt, who helped make him president, but having become president, he was determined to be president, and that meant not standing aside to allow Roosevelt to gain another term.|$|E

5|$|There were {{continuing}} {{disputes with}} the Americans over deep-sea fishing rights, and in early 1871, an Anglo-American commission {{was appointed to}} settle outstanding matters between the British (and Canadians) and the Americans. Canada was hoping to secure compensation for damage done by Fenians raiding Canada from bases in the United States. Macdonald was appointed a British commissioner, a post <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> accept as he realised Canadian interests might be sacrificed for the mother country. This {{proved to be the}} case; Canada received no compensation for the raids and no significant trade advantages in the settlement, which required Canada to open her waters to American fishermen. Macdonald returned home to defend the Treaty of Washington against a political firestorm.|$|E
5|$|When Friedrich Wilhelm IV {{came to the}} Prussian throne in 1840 with ambitions {{to develop}} Berlin as a {{cultural}} centre (including {{the establishment of a}} music school, and reform of music for the church), the obvious choice to head these reforms was Mendelssohn. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> undertake the task, especially in the light of his existing strong position in Leipzig. Mendelssohn nonetheless spent some time in Berlin, writing some church music, and, at the King's request, music for productions of Sophocles's Antigone (1841) and Oedipus at Colonus (1845), Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1843) and Racine's Athalie (1845). But the funds for the school never materialised, and various of the court's promises to Mendelssohn regarding finances, title, and concert programming were broken. He was therefore not displeased to have the excuse to return to Leipzig.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was still chaotic when King HenryIII became king after his father's death in 1216. Although Bolsover fell to Ferrers' forces in 1217 after a siege, {{there is no}} indication that Peveril was assaulted, and it is likely that Brian de Lisle negotiated his surrender. Ferrers only had possession of the lordship until King HenryIII came of age. When the time came <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> hand over the property, and after an initial deadlock the Crown took control in 1223. Although contemporary Pipe Roll records of expenditure at Peveril survive, they do not specify how the money was spent. As a result, it is unclear what constitutes maintenance and what marks substantial construction work; however, Richard Eales, who wrote the 2006 English Heritage guidebook, suggests that there were two periods of building, when sums spent were larger than usual: £54 in 1204–1207 and £67 in 1210–1212. The medieval historian Sidney Painter estimated that in about 1200 there were only seven magnates in England whose annual income exceeded £400 and a knight could easily live on £10 to £20 per year.|$|E

5|$|Tillman believed, {{and often}} stated as senator, that blacks must submit to either white {{domination}} or extermination. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> undertake the latter, fearing hundreds of whites would die accomplishing it. He campaigned in the violent 1898 North Carolina elections, in which white Democrats {{were determined to}} take back control from a biracial Populist-Republican coalition elected in 1894 and 1896 on a fusion ticket. He spoke widely in North Carolina {{in the fall of}} 1898, often to crowds wearing red shirts, disheartening his Populist supporters. Terror and intimidation again won the day for the Democrats, who were elected statewide. They failed to win in the coastal city of Wilmington, but white supremacists took over by force. South Carolina saw violence as well: an effort to register black voters in Phoenix led whites to provoke a confrontation, after which a number of African Americans were murdered. Tillman warned African Americans and those who might combine with them that black political activism would provoke a murderous response from whites.|$|E
5|$|Chapman played {{infrequently}} in 1936, and the captaincy {{was shared}} {{between him and}} two others. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> bat, {{to the extent of}} dropping down the batting order to avoid doing so, and his friends believed that his nerve had gone. At the end of the season, he announced that business commitments forced him to give up the captaincy. Over the following three seasons, Chapman played for Kent in three more matches: against the New Zealand touring side in 1937 and in two Championship games in 1938. He also captained a non-representative England XI in a festival game against the New Zealanders in 1937, batting at number ten in the order and scoring 61. His remaining first-class matches were low-profile games against Oxford and Cambridge Universities; he played 13 games in his final three seasons. In his last first-class game, in 1939, he captained MCC against Oxford, scoring 12 and 0. In all first-class cricket, Chapman scored 16,309 runs in 394 matches at an average of 31.97, and held 356 catches. By the time his career ended, his weight had increased even further, and Lemmon believes that he had become an embarrassment to other cricketers. Subsequently, Chapman faded away without much comment.|$|E
5|$|In late 1899, MacLaren {{joined a}} private cricket tour of America and Canada {{organised}} by the cricket-playing Indian prince Ranjitsinhji. The following March, {{he was appointed}} as an assistant secretary at Lancashire. The position was a sinecure; his main role was to coach the first eleven which effectively meant that he was paid to play cricket, despite his amateur status. Surviving records do not indicate his salary, but some sources suggest he was paid comfortably more than Lancashire's leading professionals. In addition, MacLaren worked as a journalist for the Daily Express, reporting on matches in which he played, a common practice at the time for amateurs. Resuming sole control over the Lancashire side, and freed from his teaching responsibilities, MacLaren played {{from the beginning of}} the 1900 season, planning meticulously in a bid to lead Lancashire to the County Championship. His batting form suffered initially, but the team dominated the start of the season. Commentators gave much of the credit to MacLaren's captaincy. However, he was severely criticised for conservative tactics in one game, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> attempt to force a win. In the latter stages of the season, MacLaren scored prolifically, making a succession of high scores at rapid pace. He ended the 1900 season with 1,554 runs at 36.13. During that season, the leading Lancashire bowler Arthur Mold had been no-balled for throwing, but MacLaren defended him in the press. At a meeting of county captains in December, MacLaren was the only representative to defend the legality of Mold's bowling action, and in 1901, Mold was again no-balled and his career was effectively over. MacLaren struggled with injury in 1901, and his batting form suffered. He frequently dropped low in the batting order, and it was late in the season before he began to score runs regularly. His captaincy was criticised after some tactical decisions which were either unconventional or unsuccessful, and he clashed with the Lancashire committee over the poor state of Old Trafford's pitch. In total, he scored 1,069 first-class runs at 31.44.|$|E
