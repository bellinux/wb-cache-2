25|$|On many {{automobile}} engines, {{including all}} Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the thermostat does not restrict {{flow to the}} <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b> The passenger side tank of the radiator {{is used as a}} bypass to the thermostat, flowing through the <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b> This prevents formation of steam pockets before the thermostat opens, and allows the heater to function before the thermostat opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the thermostat fails.|$|E
2500|$|Block heaters {{that run}} {{directly}} on the vehicle's own gasoline or diesel fuel supply are also available; these do not require an external power source. The coolant is heated and circulated, usually by thermosiphon, through the engine and the vehicle's <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Separate to {{the latent}} heat {{accumulator}} is the Residual Heat function (activated by a button labelled [...] "REST"), {{which allows the}} demister and cabin heater to use the heat of an engine that has recently been turned off (using an electric pump to push hot coolant through the <b>heater</b> <b>core).</b>|$|E

25|$|One of {{the widest}} uses of heat {{exchangers}} is for air conditioning of buildings and vehicles. This class of heat exchangers is commonly called air coils, or just coils {{due to their}} often-serpentine internal tubing.

50|$|In its short life, the XR4Ti {{had some}} minor changes either by design or by {{implemented}} Technical Service Bulletins. Examples include: monochromatic paint (red, black, and white), uprated <b>heater</b> <b>cores,</b> larger rear hatch glass (in {{conjunction with the}} single rear wing), improved steering rack, upgraded dash construction, etc. Many of these parts {{were taken from the}} Sierra Mk.II body shell which was only sold in continental Europe with some being Merkur-specific parts.

2500|$|In 1938, Nash Motors {{developed}} the first automobile heater warmed by hot engine cooling water, and using fresh air. This [...] "Conditioned Air System" [...] {{is characterized by}} a cowl-mounted outside air receiver that passes fresh air through a <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> utilizing hot engine coolant for a heat source. The Nash system also pioneered the use of slight pressurization within the passenger compartment to eliminate the infiltration of cold outside air during winter use. This was a fan-boosted filtered ventilation and heating for the passengers, not the modern meaning of an [...] "air conditioning" [...] system. Nash was also the first automobile to make use of a disposable filter in the air-intake to clean incoming air.|$|E
50|$|The <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> {{is made up}} {{of small}} piping that has {{numerous}} bends. Clogging of the piping may occur if the coolant system is not flushed or if the coolant is not changed regularly. If clogging occurs the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> will not work properly. If coolant flow is restricted, heating capacity will be reduced or even lost altogether if the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> becomes blocked. Control valves may also clog or get stuck.|$|E
50|$|Cars with dual climate {{function}} (allowing {{driver and}} passenger to each set a different temperature) may use a <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> split in two, where different amounts of coolant {{flow through the}} <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> on either side to obtain the desired heating.|$|E
40|$|Two SAFE 30 modules {{were tested}} to {{determinate}} the thermal conductivity {{efficiency of the}} tri-cusps filled between the heat pipe and the <b>heater</b> <b>cores.</b> The modules consisted of four one-inch diameter tubes with heaters joined to an empty 1 inch diam. tube. The test was conducted on a vacuum chamber with 4 configurations: tri-cusps filled with and without radiation shielding and non-filled tri-cusps with and without radiation shielding. The tri-cusps material helps the bonding of the heat pipe to the four electric <b>heater</b> <b>cores,</b> filling {{the gap between the}} pipes. The baseline configuration is a brazed joint between the pipe. The test consisted of controlling the power applied to the heaters until a set surface temperature is reach. The temperatures varied between a max. of 800 C to 500 C. Test data, input energy and chamber surface temperature from each individual test, was used as boundary conditions for the model. Nodes located on the same location as the test thermocouples were plotted again test data to determinate the accuracy of the analysis. The unknown n variables on the analysis are the radiation emissivity of the pipe and chamber and the radiation view factor between the module and the chamber. A correlation was determined using a parametric analysis varying the surface emissivity and view factor until a good match was reach...|$|R
5000|$|Many storage heaters {{also have}} a mechanically-controlled {{automatic}} output switch. In this case, if the manual output switch is not set to minimum overnight, the damper will automatically close (as if the output switch had been set to minimum), and then the damper will re-open after a time delay; this time delay {{is measured by the}} gradual drop in the <b>heater's</b> <b>core</b> temperature, and is therefore longer if the core temperature started higher due to more charge. The delay can also be biased by the output switch's setting. [...] Some output switches that are set up this way are marked [...] "early" [...] and [...] "late" [...] as well as [...] "closed" [...] and [...] "open"; the minimum [...] "closed" [...] setting corresponds with [...] "early" [...] and the maximum [...] "open" [...] setting corresponds with [...] "late". These output switches can be controlled manually by ensuring they are closed at night and opened when desired, or they can be left to automatic operation by not closing at night.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} part of a work devoted to {{corrosion}} of brazed AA 4343 /AA 3003 /AA 4343 materials on water side of automotive <b>heater</b> <b>cores.</b> The microstructure of the superficial resolidified AA 4343 brazing material has been previously characterised [1] and [2]. It is composed of large (Al) grains separated by valleys containing multiphase deposits of (Al), Si and α-Al(Mn,Fe) Si. The present study focuses on its electrochemical behaviours in neutral water–ethylene glycol mixtures at different temperatures with and without chloride ions. Three types of behaviour are revealed: (i) passivation, (ii) defective passivation and (iii) pitting corrosion at the corrosion potential. The defective passivation is investigated in greater depth. The results show that Si needles do not participate in the corrosion progress whereas the α-Al(Mn,Fe) Si particles are preferential sites for corrosion attacks. α-Al(Mn,Fe) Si particle/matrix interactions are responsible of the defective passivation at valleys level where the α-Al(Mn,Fe) Si phase particles are mainly concentrated. Increasing the temperature enhances this reactivity whereas addition of ethylene glycol decreases it and favours a transition from defective passivation to passivation for ethylene glycol content higher than 55 %...|$|R
50|$|A <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> {{is a small}} {{radiator}} located {{under the}} dashboard of the vehicle, and it consists of conductive aluminium or brass tubing with cooling fins to increase surface area.

50|$|Once {{the engine}} has warmed up, the coolant is kept {{at a more}} or less {{constant}} temperature by the thermostat. The temperature of the air entering the vehicle's interior can be controlled by using a valve limiting the amount of coolant that goes through the <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b> Another method is blocking off the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> with a door, directing part (or all) of the incoming air around the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> completely, so it does not get heated (or re-heated if the air conditioning compressor is active).

5000|$|The PD-4103 {{itself was}} {{superseded}} by the radically new, monocoque-bodied PD-4104 in mid-1953, which eliminated the traditional longitudinal steel frame, {{had a much}} improved air conditioning system which used an underfloor evaporator {{in conjunction with the}} <b>heater</b> <b>cores</b> giving a [...] "reheat" [...] system providing excellent temperature control, had commodious luggage bays afforded by the elimination of the traditional frame, and an all-new air suspension system that used common parts with 1953 transit models. The PD-4104's ride and handling were far superior to that of the old steel sprung previous models, and paved the way for higher passenger and operator expectations all through the 1950s. The new PD-4104 also was wrapped in GM's version of Raymond Loewy's [...] "Highway Traveler" [...] concept bus, which also shared most styling features with the later PD-4501 Scenicruiser, another exclusive Greyhound Lines model. The PD-4104, although appearing to be completely new, actually was a heavy reworking of Greyhound Lines' previous PD-3751/PD-4151 models, as several structural members were identical. It also, for the first several months, used the same Continental/Ingersoll-Rand engine/refrigeration compressor assembly that dated {{all the way back to}} the [...] "Silversides" [...] during World War II. This would soon give way to higher capacity, more reliable Waukesha/Trane engine/compressor combination that was rated at a nominal six tons. Although the earliest PD-4104s were fairly adequate (certainly more adequate than the PD-4103) in terms of refrigeration capacity, the later PD-4104 could overcome even the hottest and most humid climes with ease. Greyhound Lines' second order of PD-4104s used Waukesha diesels to drive their air conditioning, an option reserved for them only, while later orders for Trailways retained the standard gasoline engine. The PD-4104 would be the last GM coach for any service that used a separate engine to provide refrigeration service.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{predictions}} of geothermal reservoir behavior strongly {{depend on the}} assumed steam-water relative permeabilities, which are difficult and time-consuming to measure in the laboratory. This paper describes the esti- mation of {{the parameters of the}} relative per- meability and capillary pressure functions by automatically matching simulation results to data from a transient boiling experiment performed on a Berea sandstone. A sensitivity analysis reveals the strong dependence of the observed system behavior on effects such as heat transfer from the <b>heater</b> to the <b>core,</b> as well as heat losses through the insulation. Parameters of three conceptual models were estimated by inverse modeling.

40|$|A {{water based}} {{shielding}} system {{is being investigated}} for use on initial lunar surface power systems. The use of water may lower overall cost (as compared to development cost for other materials) and simplify operations in the setup and handling. The thermal hydraulic performance of the shield is of significant interest. The mechanism for transferring heat through the shield is natural convection. Natural convection in a representative lunar surface reactor shield design is evaluated at various power levels in the Water Shield Testbed (WST) at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The experimental data from the WST is used to anchor a CFD model. Performance of a water shield on the lunar surface is then predicted by CFD models anchored to test data.

50|$|A {{system of}} valves or baffles, or both, is usually {{incorporated}} to simultaneously operate a small radiator inside the vehicle. This small radiator, {{and the associated}} blower fan, is called the <b>heater</b> <b>core,</b> and serves to warm the cabin interior. Like the radiator, the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> acts by removing heat from the engine.

40|$|Objective: To compare four field-appropriate torso warming modalities, that do {{not require}} AC {{electrical}} power, using a human model of non-shivering hypothermia. Methods: Five subjects, serving as their own controls, were cooled four times in 8 ºC water, for 10 - 30 minutes. Shivering was inhibited by Buspirone (30 mg) taken orally prior to cooling and IV Meperidine (1. 25 mg/kg) at the end of immersion. Subjects were hoisted out of the water, dried, insulated and then underwent 120 min of either: spontaneous warming only; a charcoal heater on the chest; two flexible hot water bags (total 4 liters of water at 55 °C, replenished every 20 minutes) applied to the chest and upper back; or two chemical heat pads applied to the chest and upper back. Supplemental meperidine (maximum cumulative dose of 3. 5 mg/kg) was administered as required to inhibit shivering. Results:  Post-cooling afterdrop was compared to spontaneous warming (2. 2 °C) less for chemical heat pads (1. 5 °C) and hot water bags (1. 6 °C, p < 0. 05), and was 1. 8 °C with the charcoal <b>heater.</b>   Subsequent <b>core</b> rewarming rates, the hot water bags (0. 7 °C/h) and the charcoal heater (0. 6 °C/h), tended to be higher than chemical heat pads (0. 2 °C/h, p = 0. 055) and was significantly greater than spontaneous warming (0. 1 °C/h, p < 0. 05). Conclusion: In subjects with shivering suppressed, greater sources of external heat were effective in attenuating core temperature afterdrop whereas sustained sources of external heat effectively established core rewarming. Depending on scenario and available resources, we advice to use charcoal heaters, chemical heat pads or hot water bags as effective means for treating cold patients in the field or during transport to definitive care...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A midloop operation test was performed in 1992 at the BETHSY Integral Test Facility in Grenoble, France. The purpose of this experiment was to produce data {{that could be used to}} assess the performance of thermal hydraulic codes under the conditions of low pressure and decay heat. The specific scenario of the test involved the loss of the residual heat removal system in a midloop operation with manways vents open in the pressurizer and at the steam generator. In participation with the International Standard Problem # 38, the RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2 code was used to simulate the transient conducted experimentally at the BETHSY facility and assess its ability to accurately predict the observed phenomena. The overall conclusion is that the code performed quite well in terms of predicting macroscopic trends and their timing, but did not describe more specific thermal hydraulic phenomena accurately. Specific areas of disagreement included predicting water holdup cycles in the pressurizer, two-phase mixture levels in the guide tube, upper core void and temperature profiles, entrainment phenomena in the upper head bypass and mass flow ratios between the upper head bypass, pressurizer manway, and steam generator manway. The code predicted well the timing of the core uncovery and maximum <b>core</b> <b>heater</b> cladding temperature, and the integrated phasic mass flow rates at the steam generator manway. Some of these good predictions was the result of compensating errors in the prediction of component thermal hydraulic phenomena. The consequence of the poor code performance in predicting the pressurizer/pressurizer surge line phenomena was a substantial delay in the falloff of the initial system pressurization, an underestimation of the pressurizer integrated mass flow rate, and the emptying of the hot leg and upper plenum. Large mass errors were generated by the RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2. 1. 1 release of this code. Typical errors were around 20 % of the total system mass by the end of the transient...|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> cools {{the heated}} coolant {{from the engine}} by {{transfering}} its heat to the cabin air, it can also act as an auxiliary radiator for the engine. If the radiator is working improperly, the operator may turn the heat on (together with the cabin blower fan placed on full speed, and with the windows opened) in the passenger cabin, resulting in a certain cooling effect on the overheated engine coolant. This idea only works to a certain degree, as the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> is not large enough nor does it have enough cold air going though it to cool large amounts of coolant significantly.|$|E

50|$|A larger radiator, <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> inlets and hoses were new, for {{improved}} coolant flow and heater performance.

50|$|In a car {{equipped}} with air conditioning, outside air is first forced {{through the air}} conditioner's evaporator coil. This {{can be thought of}} as a <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> filled with very cold gas, which cools rather than heats the incoming air. In order to obtain the desired temperature incoming air may first be cooled by the air conditioning and then heated again by the <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b> In a vehicle fitted with manual controls for the heater and air conditioning compressor, using both systems together will dehumidify the air in the cabin, as the evaporator coil removes moisture from the air due to condensation. This can result in increased air comfort levels inside the vehicle. Automatic temperature control systems can take the best course of action depending upon the external air temperature, the internal one and the cabin air temperature value or a rapid defrost effect requested by the user.|$|E
50|$|Although {{not part}} of the HSD as such, all HSD {{vehicles}} from the 2004 Prius onwards have been fitted with an electric air-conditioning compressor, instead of the conventional engine-driven type.

Two positive temperature coefficient heaters are fitted in the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> to supplement the heat provided by the engine.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possible}} {{problem is}} a leak {{in one of the}} connections to the <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b> This may first be noticeable by smell (ethylene glycol is widely used as coolant and has a sweet smell); it may also cause (somewhat greasy) fogging of the windshield above the windshield heater vent. Glycol may also leak directly into the car, causing wet upholstery or carpeting.|$|E
50|$|The Roadster had no top or tonneau cover, and no {{provision}} or intention of having either. No automatic transmission was offered, only the manual 5-speed.
