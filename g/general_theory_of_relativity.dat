5|$|Several {{stars in}} Hyades cluster include Kappa Tauri were photographed during Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919 by the {{expedition}} of Arthur Eddington in Príncipe {{and others in}} Sobral, Brazil that confirmed Albert Einstein's prediction of the bending of light around the Sun from his <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> which he published in 1915.|$|E
5|$|In {{everyday}} life, {{there are}} three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and depth. Einstein's <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional spacetime, three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity {{is viewed as a}} consequence of the geometry of spacetime.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} {{was involved in}} the discovery of millisecond pulsars, and also discovered the first pulsar in a globular cluster in 1986—a millisecond pulsar in the Messier 28 globular cluster. In September 2006, the results of three years of observing a double pulsar, PSR J0737-3039, with the Lovell telescope, {{as well as with the}} Parkes and Green Bank Telescopes, were announced— confirming that the <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> is accurate to 99.5%.|$|E

40|$|Einstein’s {{special and}} <b>general</b> <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> are {{explored}} graphically and quantitatively using elementary algebra {{through a series}} of fifteen interactive lectures designed for undergraduate physics majors.   Topics covered include:  space-time diagrams, special relativity, the equivalence principle, general relativity, and black holes.   The goal of this book is to provide the student with a sound, conceptual understanding of both the special and the <b>general</b> <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity,</b> so the student will gain insight into how astrophysicists are using these theories to study black holes in the universe.   At the end of each chapter, there is a set of exercises to further facilitate the student’s understanding of the material.

50|$|Malament's work focuses the {{conceptual}} {{foundations of the}} special and <b>general</b> <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b> Regarding whether simultaneity in special relativity, the Einstein synchronisation is conventional, Malament argues against conventionalism and is regarded by some as having refuted Adolf Grünbaum's argument for conventionalism. Grünbaum, as well as Sahotra Sarkar and John Stachel, don't agree, whereas Robert Rynasiewicz sides with Malament.|$|R
5|$|Current {{understanding}} of gravity {{is based on}} Albert Einstein's <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b> Formulated in 1915, general relativity explains gravity {{in terms of the}} geometry of space and time, or spacetime. It is formulated in the language of classical physics developed by physicists such as Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell. The other nongravitational forces are explained in the framework of quantum mechanics. Developed {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century by a number of different physicists, quantum mechanics provides a radically different way of describing physical phenomena based on probability.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the deepest}} {{problems}} in modern physics {{is the problem of}} quantum gravity. The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein's <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity,</b> which is formulated within the framework of classical physics. However, nongravitational forces are described within the framework of quantum mechanics, a radically different formalism for describing physical phenomena based on probability. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the force of gravity.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} Universe is {{somewhat}} difficult to define. According to a restrictive definition, the Universe is everything within our connected spacetime that could {{have a chance to}} interact with us and vice versa. According to the <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity,</b> some regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.|$|E
50|$|This dual {{description}} {{is used to}} unify the ideas of inertial and gravitational mass under <b>general</b> <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity,</b> and to explain why an object's inertial mass and gravitational mass are proportional in classical theory. In these descriptions, the distinction is purely a matter of convenience; inertial and gravitational mass are different ways of describing the same behaviour.|$|R
50|$|In 1937 Hoffmann {{joined the}} {{mathematics}} department of Queens College, {{part of the}} City University of New York, where he remained till the late 1970s. He retired in the 1960s but continued to teach one course a semester — in the fall a course on classical and quantum mechanics and in the spring one on the special and <b>general</b> <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In this way, <b>general</b> <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> are {{supposed}} to also eliminate the strict distinction between inertial and noninertial frames. If we take an inertial observer in flat spacetime and have them observe a rotating disc, {{the existence of the}} rotating mass means that spacetime is no longer flat, and that the concept of rotation is now subject to the democratic principle.|$|R
5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by {{physical}} laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians. Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the Universe including both all of space and all of time. Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity,</b> which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the Universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> to the {{structure}} of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{publishing}} the special {{theory of relativity}} in 1905, Einstein started {{thinking about how to}} incorporate gravity into his new relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations. These equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present, and form the core of Einstein's <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{special and}} <b>general</b> <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> require a rather {{different}} type of mathematics. This was group theory, which {{played an important role}} in both quantum field theory and differential geometry. This was, however, gradually supplemented by topology and functional analysis [...] in the mathematical description of cosmological as well as quantum field theory phenomena. In this area both homological algebra and category theory are important nowadays.|$|R

5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields and—with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916—he published a paper on general relativity. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> to model the large-scale structure of the universe.|$|E
5|$|Celestial bodies {{interior}} to {{the orbit}} of Mercury have been hypothesized, and searched for, for centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner thought he had seen small bodies passing {{in front of the}} Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury's orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet's perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the gravitational influence of a small planet or ring of asteroids within {{the orbit of}} Mercury would explain the deviation. Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier's proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury's orbit was explained by Einstein's <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault saw was probably another sunspot.|$|E
5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity,</b> observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{giving more}} respectability to the geocentric view than Newtonian physics does, {{relativity}} is not geocentric. Rather, relativity {{states that the}} Sun, the Earth, the Moon, Jupiter, or any other point for that matter could be chosen as a center {{of the solar system}} with equal validity. For this reason Robert Sungenis, a modern geocentrist, spent much of Volume I of his book Galileo Was Wrong: The Church Was Right critiquing and trying to unravel the Special and <b>General</b> <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>Relativity.</b>|$|R
