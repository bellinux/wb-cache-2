We evaluated the toxic effect of 24 nanoparticles of similar <b>equivalent</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>diameter</b> and various elemental compositions on 2 human pulmonary cell lines: A 549 and THP- 1. A secondary aim was to elaborate a generic experimental set-up {{that would allow the}} rapid screening of cytotoxic effect of nanoparticles. We therefore compared 2 cytotoxicity assays (MTT and Neutral Red) and analyzed 2 time points (3 and 24 hours) for each cell type and nanoparticle. When possible, TC 50 (Toxic Concentration 50 i. e. nanoparticle concentration inducing 50 % cell mortality) was calculated. RESULTS: The use of MTT assay on THP- 1 cells exposed for 24 hours appears to be the most sensitive experimental design to assess the cytotoxic effect of one nanoparticle. With this experimental set-up, Copper- and Zinc-based nanoparticles appear to be the most toxic. Titania, Alumina, Ceria and Zirconia-based nanoparticles show moderate toxicity, and no toxicity was observed for Tungsten Carbide.

Zooplankton abundance and biomass ranged from 5000 to 1 170 000 ind. m^[- 2] and 0. 2 to 10. 9 g dry dry-mass m^[- 2], respectively. Based on the zooplankton biovolume at 48 bins every 0. 1 mm between 0. 25 - 5. 0 mm <b>equivalent</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>diameters</b> (ESD), Bray-Curtis cluster analysis classified zooplankton communities into four groups (A-D).

Analysis of Normalized Biomass Size Spectra (NBSS) with groups revealed that the groups A and C were highly productive. Thus, the zooplankton community in the south of Lisburne Peninsula was constantly highly productive, which may be caused by the continuous inflow of Pacific Water containing high nutrients.

Growth (max doublings d- ’- 2. 9, max C production- 21 g m- 2 d-l) of phytoplankton upwellcd from source water was rapid, with little evidence of a lag phase. The growth pattern differed for each community encountered and was related to the rate of mixing of the water column and the nutrient and light regimes. Production rates were highest in newly upwelled waters and lowest under limiting light and during periods of nitrate depletion in the upper mixed layer.

40|$|In {{several recent}} papers {{dealing with the}} feeding of copepods on natural {{particle}} assem-blages investigators have claimed to show types of behavior more complex than simple siev-ing by the animals. We question these interpretations because first, the sensing-zone counters used in these experiments size particles {{on the basis of}} their volumes, so that the <b>equivalent</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>diameters</b> thus obtained bear little relationship to the linear dimensions of many algal cells; and second, sieves remove particles from water {{on the basis of their}} linear di-mensions, not necessarily on the basis of their volumes. If mixtures of phytoplankton of diverse shapes are passed through a sieve and sized with a sensing-zone counter, the sieve will appear to have “behavior. ” Two other sources of artifact-the breakage of phytoplankton cells by experimental agitation and by the feeding of the copepods-add to the difficulties of interpreting natural particle experiments. Proper control experiments to evaluate the contri-bution of these sources of artifact to experimental results have not yet been done.

Using high-speed video, we determined detection distances and durations of {{all elements of}} the food gathering process in two small calanoid copepods, Paracalanus parvus and Pseudocalanus sp. Animals were freely swimming and presented with various phytoplankton species with <b>equivalent</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>diameters</b> ranging from 7 mm to 33 mm. Prey detection occurred very close—within a few cell radii—to the second antennae (53 % of the cases) or the maxilliped (42 %). There was no effect of prey size on detection distance, but larger prey caused a significantly longer handling time. Post-detection processing of the cells was exceedingly fast. The time from detection to the cell being placed at the mouth lasted 35 6 19 ms and rejection of unwanted cells 61 6 21 ms. Grooming of antennules and carapace occurred intermittently and lasted 215 – 227 ms. The weak feeding current and fast response of the copepods allowed ample time for detection of cells entrained in the feeding current and no distant olfaction was observed. Modeled effect of cell size on cell surface concentration of cue chemicals show that only cells with a radius larger than, 15 mm may be detected chemically and that only very much larger and/or very leaky cells can be detected at distance. Copepods have elaborate and exceedingly fast handling techniques that allow effective prey detection and capture, {{but there is no}} evidence of remote chemically mediated sensing when feeding on algal cells up to a size of 35 mm. Marine copepods play a pivotal role in marine food webs by making primary production available to higher trophic levels.

The overall hydrolysis/condensation reaction followed pseudo 2 nd-order kinetics at 303 K, with an induction period of < 1 to 24 hours. The induction period could be substantially reduced by increasing the temperature to 348 K. For hydrolysis with 3. 6 moles of water per mole of alkoxide, the apparent activation energy was 24 kJ mol- 1. Such a low activation energy implies that hydrolysis occurs readily over the temperature range investigated (303 - 348 K).

40|$|Jellyfish form {{spectacular}} blooms {{throughout the}} world?s oceans. Jellyfish body plans are characterised by high water and low carbon contents which {{enables them to}} grow much larger than non-gelatinous animals of equivalent carbon content and to deviate from non-gelatinous pelagic animals when incorporated into allometric relationships. Jellyfish have, however, been argued to conform to allometric relationships when carbon content is used as the metric for comparison. Here we test the hypothesis that differences in allometric relationships for several key functional parameters remain for jellyfish even after their body sizes are scaled to their carbon content. Data on carbon and nitrogen contents, rates of respiration, excretion, growth, longevity and swimming velocity of jellyfish and other pelagic animals were assembled. Allometric relationships between each variable and the <b>equivalent</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>diameters</b> of jellyfish and other pelagic animals were compared before and after sizes of jellyfish were standardised for their carbon content. Before standardisation, {{the slopes of the}} allometric relationships for respiration, excretion and growth were the same for jellyfish and other pelagic taxa but the intercepts differed. After standardisation, slopes and intercepts for respiration were similar but excretion rates of jellyfish were 10 × slower, and growth rates 2 × faster than those of other pelagic animals. Longevity of jellyfish was independent of size. The slope of the allometric relationship of swimming velocity of jellyfish differed from that of other pelagic animals but because they are larger jellyfish operate at Reynolds numbers approximately 10 × greater than those of other pelagic animals of comparable carbon content. We conclude that low carbon and high water contents alone do not explain the differences in the intercepts or slopes of the allometric relationships of jellyfish and other pelagic animals and that the evolutionary longevity of jellyfish and their propensity to form blooms is facilitated by their unique body plans.
