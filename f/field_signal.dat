50|$|At this time, balloon {{companies}} were a corps-level asset. The Army of World War I included an aero squadron in every corps. Other auxiliary units for a corps were an anti-aircraft machine-gun and anti- aircraft artillery battalion, a remount depot a bakery company, a troop transport train, a telegraph battalion, a <b>field</b> <b>signal</b> battalion, a photo section and a sales commissary unit.|$|E
50|$|The {{regiment}} has {{its origins}} in the <b>field</b> <b>signal</b> (later telegraphy) company raised in 1871 and subordinated to Pontoon Battalion in 1875.

An aircraft squadron was created in 1916 and split from the unit in 1926, this squadron would later become the Swedish Air Force.|$|E

40|$|Lightning on Venus {{has been}} {{suggested}} by many researchers. The evidence for this lightning has been claimed to be impulsive electric <b>field</b> <b>signals</b> which have been detected {{by a number of}} spacecraft. However, others have proposed that the observed signals are a result of local ionospheric plasma instabilities and do not originate in the lower atmosphere. An investigation of 100 Hz electric <b>field</b> <b>signals</b> detected within the ionosphere of Venus has been conducted. The study encompassed both previously published 100 Hz signals which have been identified as being a result of lightning in the lower atmosphere and data which was newly selected for this research. It is shown that the 100 Hz signals result most often from the lower hybrid plasma wave mode. The remaining signals are from other plasma instabilities due to magnetic field and/or ion density gradients...|$|R
