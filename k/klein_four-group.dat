25|$|Noncommutative rings {{serve as}} an active area of {{research}} due to their ubiquity in mathematics. For instance, the ring of n-by-n matrices over a field is noncommutative despite its natural occurrence in geometry, physics and many parts of mathematics. More generally, endomorphism rings of abelian groups are rarely commutative, the simplest example being the endomorphism ring of the <b>Klein</b> <b>four-group.</b>|$|E
25|$|All non-identity {{elements}} of the Klein group have order 2, thus any two non-identity elements can serve as generators in the above presentation. The <b>Klein</b> <b>four-group</b> is the smallest non-cyclic group.

25|$|The {{principle}} of duality can be explained from a group theory perspective by {{fact that there are}} exactly four functions that are one-to-one mappings (automorphisms) of the set of Boolean polynomials back to itself: the identity function, the complement function, the dual function and the contradual function (complemented dual). These four functions form a group under function composition, isomorphic to the <b>Klein</b> <b>four-group,</b> acting on the set of Boolean polynomials. Walter Gottschalk remarked that consequently a more appropriate name for the phenomenon would be the principle (or square) of quaternality.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Klein</b> <b>four-group</b> as a {{subgroup}} of the alternating group A4 {{is not the}} automorphism group of any simple graph.

In Galois theory, this map corresponds to the resolving cubic to a quartic polynomial, which allows the quartic to be solved by radicals, as established by Lodovico Ferrari. The Klein group can be understood in terms of the Lagrange resolvents of the quartic.
