5000|$|One of the corollaries of the conical {{action is}} that collets may draw the work axially a slight amount as they close. Collet chuck systems that make no {{provision}} {{to prevent this}} draw-in are often called <b>draw-in</b> <b>collet</b> chucks, in contrast to systems which circumvent this movement, usually by pushing the tapered closing ring toward the collet rather than pulling the collet into the ring. Such non-draw-in types are often called [...] "dead-length" [...] or [...] "non-draw-in" [...] collet chucks. Draw-in {{is not always a}} problem, but avoiding it can be helpful on some work where failing to account for it might result in inaccuracy on part overall length, shoulder lengths, etc.|$|E
