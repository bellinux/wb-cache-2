40|$|Currently the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> has twelve {{official}} languages, and as new {{countries are}} added to the <b>European</b> <b>Union,</b> the number of official languages will increase. Through the Economic and Monetary <b>Union,</b> the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> addressed the issue of multiple currencies in the union by adopting a single new currency.

40|$|This paper applies {{theories}} of international socialization {{to examine the}} impact of <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> contact on the professional socialization of public officials in Central and Eastern Europe. Based on a survey of officials in seven new member states, the paper finds that daily work on <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> issues is associated with favourable attitudes towards merit-based civil service governance. The distinction between types of <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> contact shows that officials dealing with ‘reception’-related <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> activities such as the transposition and implementation of <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> policies develop more meritocratic attitudes. By contrast, ‘projection’-related activities that involve personal contact with <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> officials have no effect. The paper concludes that the small but consistent impact of <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> contact on professional socialization promotes the silent professionalization of public administration in Central and Eastern Europe...|$|R

50|$|The general {{principles}} of <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> law are rules of law which a <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> judge, sitting {{for example in}} the European Court of Justice, has to find and apply but not create.

In practice the European Court of Justice has applied general principles to all aspects of <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> law. In formulating general principles, <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> judges draw on a variety of sources, including: public international law and its general principles inherent to all legal systems; national laws of the member states, that is general principles common to the laws of all member states, general principles inferred from <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> law, and fundamental human rights.

Eventually, in order to reduce democratic deficit participation of individual citizens became inevitable for the purpose of creation of a genuine link between individuals and the <b>European</b> <b>Union,</b> which helps to ensure its proper governance. Although some rights linked with citizenship had been already incorporated into the law of the <b>European</b> <b>Union,</b> citizenship of the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> was embedded into the primary law of the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> by the Maastricht Treaty.
