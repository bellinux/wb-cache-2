5|$|In the rideability test, {{the horse}} is {{evaluated}} {{by a member of}} the studbook <b>evaluation</b> <b>committee</b> by being ridden at a walk, trot and canter. The horse's movement, balance and disposition are evaluated and given 4 to 10 points. The horse should express cooperation, gentleness, attentiveness, sensitivity to cues, and active effort. This test is required for riding-type horses, and optional for pony-sized horses in lieu of the driveability test.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) {{selected}} Guangzhou to {{host the}} 2010 Games at their 23rd general assembly session in Doha, Qatar, site of the 2006 Asian Games, on July 1, 2004. Seoul and Amman dropped out before their bids were officially selected by the OCA, leaving only two candidate cities— Guangzhou and Kuala Lumpur. Seoul withdrew after considering the short span of time between 2002 and 2010, as South Korea hosted the 2002 Games in Busan. <b>Evaluation</b> <b>committee</b> of the OCA, headed by the then vice-president of the association Celso Dayrit inspected both the final bidders. Kuala Lumpur was forced to withdraw its bid after the declaration of the Malaysian Government on April 15, 2004 that it wouldn't support the Olympic Council of Malaysia with a Kuala Lumpur bid, due to {{the high cost of}} hosting the Games, leaving Guangzhou as the sole bidder.|$|E
5|$|Vaseegaran prepares Chitti for an {{evaluation}} by the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development (AIRD) Institute, which {{is headed by}} Bohra. During the evaluation, Chitti attempts to stab Vaseegaran at Bohra's command, which convinces the <b>evaluation</b> <b>committee</b> that the robot is a liability and cannot be used for military purposes. Vaseegaran's effort to prove Bohra wrong fails when he deploys Chitti to rescue people from a burning building. The robot saves most of them, including a girl named Selvi who was bathing at the time, but she is ashamed at being seen naked on camera and flees, only to be hit and killed by a truck. Vaseegaran asks for one month to modify Chitti's neural schema to enable it to understand human behaviour and emotions, to which Bohra agrees. While nearing the deadline, Chitti becomes angry with Vaseegaran, demonstrating to him that it can manifest emotions.|$|E

40|$|Forty-four job evaluators, {{selected}} from eight different job evaluation teams, {{were asked to}} complete a survey describing their perceptions of various interpersonal influence tactics as applied to the group dynamics of job <b>evaluation</b> <b>committees.</b> In addition, measures were obtained for gender, self-esteem, need for dominance, and need for affiliation, for each job evaluator. Multiple regressions indicated a number of significant relationships between individual-difference variables and the self-reported use of interpersonal influence strategies in job <b>evaluation</b> <b>committees.</b> Results are discussed in terms of their implications for the group dynamics involved within job <b>evaluation</b> <b>committees.</b> As an area of research, job evaluation has seen increasing attention by industrial psychologists in recent years. Although a number of studies were done in the 1940 s and 1950 s (e. g., Ash, 1948; Lawshe, 1945; Lawshe & Farbo, 1949; Lawshe & Maleski, 1946), a hiatus occurred in such research.

25|$|It {{was widely}} felt that Delhi's lack of enthusiasm {{to host the}} event was {{the primary reason for}} its loss. Then Union Sports Minister of India, Mani Shankar Aiyar, spoke {{strongly}} against Delhi hosting the games and argued that it was better if the money allocated by India's government for organizing the sporting event was spent on building facilities for the poor. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president revealed that India's Sports Minister remarks against hosting the Games was the main reason for New Delhi's loss. The IOA delegation also added that the bids <b>evaluation</b> <b>committee</b> was concerned about pollution and traffic in Delhi. Delhi offering US$200,000 to each team for games support against Incheon's offer of US$20 million to all 45 nations participating in the event could also have contributed to the defeat.|$|E
