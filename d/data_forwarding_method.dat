This problem becomes more {{worse in the}} presence of large amount of data transmission, like multimedia data. This paper refers to Levy walk based multi-hop data forwarding protocol called Data Transmission Time and Human Walk Velocity (DTT-HWV) for Opportunistic Mobile Phone Sensor Networks (OMPSN). This paper, in particular evaluates the performance of proposed protocol in terms of end-to-end waiting time to receive data, which is an important QoS requirement for data transmission in opportunistic networks. The proposed protocol DTT-HWV reduces end-to-end waiting time to receive data compared to Random Progress (RP) <b>data</b> <b>forwarding</b> <b>method</b> in presence of low battery power and high path loss.

40|$|In {{vehicular}} ad hoc networks (VANETs), a hotspot, such as {{a parking}} lot, is an information source and will receive inquiries from many vehicles for seeking any possible free parking space. According to the routing protocols in literature, each of the vehicles needs to flood its route discovery (RD) packets to discover a route to the hotspot before sending inquiring packets to the parking lot. As a result, the VANET nearby an urban area or city center may incur the problem of broadcast storm due to so many flooding RD packets during rush hours. To avoid the broadcast storm problem, this paper presents a hotspot-enabled routing-tree based <b>data</b> <b>forwarding</b> <b>method,</b> called the intelligent information dissemination scheme (IID). Our method can let the hotspot automatically decide when to build the routing-tree for proactive information transmissions {{under the condition that}} the number of vehicle routing discoveries during a given period exceeds a certain threshold which is calculated through our developed analytical packet delivery model. The routing information will be dynamically maintained by vehicles located at each intersection near the hotspot if the maintaining cost is less than that of allowing vehicles to discover routes themselves. Simulation results show that this method can minimize routing delays for vehicles with lower packets delivery overheads...|$|E

In DTNs, the intermediate nodes on a communication path are expected to store, carry, and forward the in-transit messages (or bundles) in an opportunistic way, which is called opportunistic <b>data</b> <b>forwarding.</b> Such a <b>forwarding</b> <b>method</b> depends on the hypothesis that each individual node is ready to forward packets for others.

In addition, we introduce several efficiency optimization techniques to improve the overall efficiency by exploiting the unique characteristics of DTNs.

However, it could be severely interrupted or even disabled when privacy preservation of users is applied, because that users become unrecognizable {{to each other and}} the social ties and interactions are no longer traceable to facilitate cooperative <b>data</b> <b>forwarding.</b> Therefore, how to enable efficient user cooperation in mobile social networks (MSNs) without intruding user privacy is a challenging issue. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing the social morality – a fundamental social feature of human society – to MSNs, and accordingly design a threestep protocol suite to achieve both privacy preservation and cooperative <b>data</b> <b>forwarding.</b> Firstly, the developed protocol adopts a novel privacy-preserving route-based authenticatio...|$|R

Three performance metrics are compared in this paper, such as the successful delivery ratio and delivery delay, and they are defined as follows.|$|R
