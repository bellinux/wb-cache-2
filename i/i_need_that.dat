40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION [...] . on a {{par with}} grass & twigs [...] . byBrian Griffeath-LoebDoctor of Philosophy in MusicUniversity of California, San Diego, 2013 Professor Rand Steiger, Chair "What in my music would I be most fearful to let go of?" The {{question}} provokes clear, visceral response, an indication of fear and reluctance. Curiously, the answer is never the favorite or most personal element but the safety net [...] some long-ago discovery, since emptied of all provocation, yet clung to out of habit. It is the thing I don't even see, yet whose proposed absence triggers immediate protest: "No, you see, <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>that</b> thing there in order to keep doing my work [...] the important stuff [...] over here. " But the truth is the "work over here" has already been done. Were it otherwise, my question would not have triggered such opposition, which latter exposes a refusal to even look [...] a creative blind spot. And so what appeared necessary support for experimentation is in fact the very thing preventing it. Looking back, my development while at UCSD has been a reiterative process of mounting frustration leading to impasse, followed by new means of relinquishing control, allowing another step forward.
