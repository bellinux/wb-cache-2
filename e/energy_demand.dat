5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels {{and should not be}} {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a sustainable transport system and so must be developed as part of an integrated approach, which promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency, as well as reducing the overall <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> and need for transport. Consideration needs to be given to the development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, public transport, and better town and rural planning.|$|E
5|$|Efficiency is {{essential}} to slowing the <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketone bodies}} are {{possibly}} anticonvulsant in themselves; in animal models, acetoacetate and acetone protect against seizures. The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism {{that increase the}} energy reserves; ketone bodies are a more efficient fuel than glucose, {{and the number of}} mitochondria is increased. This may help the neurons to remain stable in the face of increased <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> during a seizure, and may confer a neuroprotective effect.|$|E

5|$|Due to this {{extremely}} thin membranous tissue, a bat's wing {{can significantly}} {{contribute to the}} organism's total gas exchange efficiency. Because of the high <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> of flight, the bat's body meets those demands by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing. When the bat has its wing in an open/spread out position it allows {{for an increase in}} surface area to volume ratio. The surface area of the wings is about 85% of the total body surface area, suggesting the possibility of a useful amount of gas exchange. The subcutaneous vessels in the membrane very close to the surface allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographic}} and geomorphic characteristics of Argentina tend to create extreme weather conditions, often leading to natural disasters that negatively impact the country both economically and socially. The Pampas, {{where many of}} the large cities are located, has a flat topography and poor water drainage, making it vulnerable to flooding. Severe storms can lead to tornados, damaging hail, storm surges, and high winds, causing extensive damage to houses and infrastructure, displacing thousands of people and causing significant loss of life. Extreme temperature events such as heat waves and cold waves impact rural and urban areas by negatively impacting agriculture, one of the main economic activities of the country, and by increasing <b>energy</b> <b>demand,</b> which can lead to energy shortages.|$|E

5|$|The {{physiological}} {{responses of the}} epaulette shark to low oxygen are mediated by the nucleoside adenosine. In hypoxic conditions, the heart and ventilation rates drop sharply. The shark's blood pressure falls by half as the blood vessels dilate to deliver more blood to the brain and heart. Unlike in bony fishes and tetrapods, the blood flow rate remains constant {{and there is no}} elevation of blood glucose levels. The brains of sharks only consume a third as much ATP as those of teleosts. The epaulette shark is able to lower this <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> further by reducing the metabolism of certain areas of its brain, e.g. keeping the sensory nuclei functional while deactivating the motor nuclei. This allows the shark to supply enough ATP to prevent neuron death, while still remaining alert to its environment.|$|E
5|$|To promote sustainability, {{the site}} was {{selected}} directly adjacent to an already used part of a major ski area. It was also designed to minimize vegetation and the ecological footprint in the area. For energy efficiency, trees were retained to cast shade with weather protection and a shading system used to cover parts of the track. The track itself is painted white to maintain low temperatures while minimizing <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> on the refrigeration system. Waste heat from the refrigeration plant is captured and reused to heat buildings on-site, and could provide other heat uses in the future. Any wood waste created from site clearing activities during venue construction was composted for reuse. Other on-site buildings also followed similar green building design principles.|$|E
5|$|Heat {{waves are}} a common feature of summers in the city. These heat waves place extra demand on {{electricity}} usage, leading to shortages. In extreme cases, these power shortages during heat waves can cause traffic jams and protests, such as the December 2013 heat wave (longest heat wave ever recorded in Buenos Aires) where increased <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> lead to energy shortages and power cuts, protests against the government over the lack of service, and traffic jams {{as a result of}} these protests. However, most heat waves are of short duration (usually less than a week), and are followed by the passage of the cold, dry Pampero wind, which brings violent and intense thunderstorms with strong gusts and hail followed by cooler temperatures and lower humidity. Occasionally, a tornado can form, which can strike the city although most tornadoes are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths. The greatest risk for tornadoes occurs in the summer season due to the favourable conditions. These severe storms can damage cars, houses and disrupt public services such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste.|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation thesis deals with rotary mowers, specifically {{with the issue}} of mulching. In the theoretical part the reader is being familiar with the technology of mulching and its importance. Further, the individual types of mulchers and its advantages and disadvantages are described.

The results of measurement of the <b>energy</b> <b>demands</b> of the mulcher with vertical axis of rotation are presented. The dependency of input power, specific energy consumption and fuel consumption on mass performance of the machine are created. Furthermore, the <b>energy</b> <b>demands</b> was determined, while mulcher was working continuously at the permanent grassland. The energy losses of the mulcher were also analyzed. The effect of modification of operational and constructional parameters on the <b>energy</b> <b>demands</b> and quality of work of the mulcher wit vertical axis of rotation is studied. From the constructional parameters the shape of working tool, especially cloth angle and rake angle of the tool, and shape of the cover of the mulcher workspace is modified. From the operational parameters the cutting speed and mass performance according to conditions is modified...|$|R

5|$|The {{incentive}} to use 100% renewable energy for electricity, transport, or even {{total primary energy}} supply globally, has been motivated by global warming and other ecological {{as well as economic}} concerns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global <b>energy</b> <b>demand.</b> In reviewing 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050. Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply.|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The primary function of skeletal muscle is to generate tension, and this ultimately occurs through ATP utilization. An increase in ADP and a depression in the cellular energy state are thought to be limited by the adenylate kinase (AK) reaction during high <b>energy</b> <b>demands.</b> AMP production through AK is also thought to be important for metabolic signaling, particularly during moderate <b>energy</b> <b>demands.</b> Thus, AK deficiency in muscle was evaluated during highly demanding and moderately demanding muscle contractions, using the AK 1 knockout mouse (AK 1 -/-). The results demonstrate that AK deficiency leads to a marked elevation in free-ADP (1. 5 mM) at high <b>energy</b> <b>demands,</b> many fold greater than previously thought possible. These results call into question previously held views concerning the energy required for normal muscle function, because the performance was remarkably tolerant of ADP accumulation. At lower <b>energy</b> <b>demands,</b> AMPK phosphorylation was tempered in AK 1 -/- muscle consistent with reduced AMP production. Interestingly, other indicators of AMPK activity suggest that AMPK activation occurs normally, despite reduced AMPK phosphorylation. Thus, AK is critically important for the management of ADP during high <b>energy</b> <b>demands,</b> and may result in altered metabolic signaling at low <b>energy</b> <b>demands...</b>|$|R

This study aims to clarify connections between urban form and its use together with the associated <b>energy</b> <b>demands</b> for infrastructure (buildings and paved surfaces) and transport. The model is tested through case studies of two Phoenix sub-areas, one in downtown Phoenix, which is undergoing redevelopment towards higher density housing and the second, a low-density suburban area at the edge of Phoenix, which has undergone significant growth in the last two decades. The results indicate that older inner city areas continue to have the lowest <b>energy</b> <b>demands</b> and carbon emissions per capita compared to other neighborhoods examined. The low-density areas in the inner city and in the newer suburbs have almost equal amounts of <b>energy</b> <b>demands</b> per capita.
