This sets the scene for the second part which will focus on the outcomes of a recent study of com pliance with competition law by UK businesses commissioned by the Competition and Markets Authority, and allows us to reflect on compliance research more generally and what can or should be done to further facilitate, cajole and encourage competition law compliance...|$|E

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{evidence suggests that}} firms overpay for fraud liability and overspend on internal compliance mechanisms (which are not very effective at preventing fraud). Yet, insiders who commit fraud are rarely sanctioned for their wrongdoing, which produces moral hazard and individual underdeterrence. Two factors explain the failure to sanction managers who commit fraud. First, managers control the information revealing {{who was involved in}} account fraud and, thus, can impede external <b>investigations</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctions.</b> Second, managers also influence whether the firm will investigate and sanction accounting fraud internally. Managers’ control over settlement and the availability of directors’ and officers’ insurance further reduce the likelihood that dishonest mangers will be sanctioned. Most proposals have focused on reducing the costs of fraud liability to firms by raising pleading standards or eliminating corporate liability for accounting fraud altogether, but have neglected the question of individual deterrence. Although these proposals might reduce the costs to firms, accounting fraud cannot be deterred effectively without shifting liability to those responsible. High levels of fraud are inevitable, so long as social costs of fraud exceed private costs. To sanction dishonest insiders, private and public enforcers need to know their identities and their actions, which is often prohibitively costly to obtain their firm cooperation. This Article proposes using leverage against the firm to encourage disclosing private information, thereby lowering overall enforcement costs and increasing the probability that dishonest insiders will be sanctioned. At the same time, the proposal also reduces the risk that firms will overpay, because ex post cooperation will reduce firms’ liability. The Article develops the conditions for superiority of leveraged sanctions and proposes that their use be expanded to civil and regulatory actions, eliminating many of the concerns that leverage raises in criminal investigations. Improved deterrence is significant because it will reduce accounting fraud, producing more efficient capital markets...|$|E
40|$|The current EU {{competition}} law enforcement regime {{was created by}} Regulation 1 / 2003 which entered into force on 1 May 2004. In essence, the system {{is based on a}} decentralised model where the European Commission and national competition authorities have parallel competences to apply EU competition provisions. National competition authorities and courts are obliged to apply Articles 101 and 102 TFEU whenever they apply national {{competition law}} to anti-competitive conduct which may affect trade between Member States. Regulation 1 / 2003 does not, however, preclude parallel proceedings being conducted by several competition authorities in connection with the same anti-competitive conduct. The lack of a ban on multiple proceedings is problematic {{in the light of the}} fundamental principle of ne bis in idem which precludes trying and punishing twice for the same criminal offence. This question has become all the more relevant upon the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty which conferred the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union a legally binding status. The ne bis in idem provision inscribed therein provides an EU-wide protection against double prosecution and punishment. Furthermore, ne bis in idem is also recognised as a general principle of EU law, and it is enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights which the Union shall accede to. The principle is intrinsically linked to the doctrine of res judicata and is an element of the right to a fair trial, providing proportionality and upholding legal certainty. It precludes not only an accumulation of sanctions, but also any repetition of proceedings in the same matter. The principle encompasses two elements, namely the notion of the ‘same offence’ (idem) and the aspect of ‘twice’ (bis). Although ne bis in idem traditionally applies only in criminal proceedings, the term ‘criminal’ is interpreted broadly and hence the principle also applies in the enforcement of competition law. The purpose of this study is to examine how the ne bis in idem principle should be interpreted in connection with parallel proceedings carried out in the enforcement of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, and whether the current enforcement regime ensures sufficient compliance with the principle. Can the principle be interpreted as such that it actually precludes multiple <b>investigations</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctions</b> in connection with the same anti-competitive conduct? These questions are explored from a traditional legal dogmatic approach. In addition to examining primary and secondary legislative tools, this study also refers to soft law instruments. Moreover, analysing court interpretations given to the ne bis in idem principle naturally forms an essential part of this study. Basically, there are three areas of law where the principle has been applied in the EU. First, the Court of Justice has interpreted the principle in competition law matters. Furthermore, the Court has also interpreted the rule in the area of freedom, security and justice where the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement provides the applicable provision. Finally, the European Court of Human Rights has interpreted the ne bis in idem rule in the legal framework of the Council of Europe. The case law analysis shows that the interpretation of the ne bis in idem principle in competition matters differs from the other lines of case law. The main difference is that the application of the principle in the area of competition law is subject to three cumulative conditions, namely identity of the facts, unity of offender and unity of the legal interest protected. By contrast, in other areas of law the only relevant criterion is the identity of facts which naturally comprises the unity of offender. One reason for this discrepancy is that the principle of ne bis in idem originates from criminal law, whereas competition infringements cannot always be directly compared to traditional crimes. Defining what constitutes a same competition infringement for which a second investigation and sanction is precluded is difficult due to the fact that anti-competitive conduct consists of a large number of separate acts committed over a long period of time, sometimes even in the territory of several states. The produced effects are essential when assessing the infringement. The doctrine of the three cumulative conditions as well as other principles for applying the ne bis in idem rule in the context of competition law have been developed by the CJEU roughly during the past four decades. Due to the developments in the field of EU competition policy as well as human and fundamental rights protection, there is room for the Court of Justice to critically re-evaluate its interpretation of the ne bis in idem principle in competition matters and make adjustments to match its view with the current state of affairs. The fundamental right of not being tried or punished twice for the same offence has to be observed also in the enforcement of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is misbehaviour of employees. Employers tend to {{investigate}} <b>and</b> <b>sanction</b> misbehaviour of employees. This study investigates the question whether there are (sufficient) rules to legitimise <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctioning</b> by employers (in the Netherlands), and the subquestions that arise from this issue. Both for investigation by the employer <b>and</b> for <b>sanctioning</b> by the employer the resemblance between the relationship employer-employee and government-citizen is of importance. As far as investigation by the employer is concerned, I concluded that the current rules legitimize the competence of the employer, on two conditions. First a legal rule should be introduced that explicitly regulates the fundamental right of privacy of the employee. For the introduction of such a legal rule support {{can be found in}} German labour law. In this legal system the "Persönlichkeitsrecht" is the starting-point of the regulation of the competence of th! e employer to investigate. Secondly, unambiguous rules about illegally obtained evidence should be introduced in labour law. This condition also finds support in German labour law. Concerning imposing sanctions by the employer I concluded that the ne bis in idem principle and the principle of guilt should also be adopted in labour law. Once more support and inspiration {{can be found in the}} German legal system: the BAG sets high requirements on the admissibility of a "Verdachtskündigung". Furthermore support can be found in the adjacent legal branch of law: social security law. To legitimise the imposing of punishments by employers, the current regulation should be expanded. In this way legal certainty and legal equality of the employees can be guaranteed. The constitutional guarantees can be used as inspiration. This leads to the conclusion that the expansion should take place preferably on legal level. Only when absolutely necessary, considering the need for customized! arrangements, the regulation can take place on a lower level. Finally Dutch labour law should provide an independent complaints procedure. Again inspiration can be borrowed from the German labour law system...|$|R
40|$|It seems {{improbable}} {{that the}} theoretical and doctrinal framework of criminal procedure, developed mostly through a binary {{model of the}} individual and the state, would fit without modification in the tripartite model of the state, the firm, and the individual that characterizes the <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctioning</b> of criminal conduct within legal entities. This intuition—which has been underexplored in spite of heated public debate about the state’s practices in this area—proves correct. I develop some components of a framework for understanding procedure for individual cases of criminal wrongdoing within firms and generating insights to guide reform. The process of pursuing individual cases within firms (as opposed to firm cases against firms) is distinctive for at least three reasons: in terms of causation and incentives, the presence of an organization materially alters the incidence of individual misconduct ex ante and the efficiency and efficacy of investigating and prosecuting that conduct ex post; the nature of the applicable substantive criminal violations (white collar crimes) causes such cases to ripen into criminal cases more slowly than those outside business firms; and lawyers have multiple roles in such cases not only ex post but also ex ante. I evaluate two current practices in light of these structural differences: state use of the fruits of employer coercion of employees’ waivers of the right to silence; and state negotiation with firms over the scope of firms’ indemnification of their agents for litigation costs. I conclude that some reforms of current practices in these areas would be beneficial but that calls for abolition of those practices are misguided...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} a growing volume of {{research}} on different types of fraud, relatively little has been written about fraudulent consumer behaviour. Even fewer studies have been written about fraudulent consumer behaviour in the retail sector, nor of the strategies for managing such fraud. This study filled this identified gap. The focus of this study is not on large-scale corporate fraud but on consumers who misrepresent the facts of their interaction with a retailer for personal gain. The ethnographic case study method employing semi-structured interviews and observation (in one of the companies) was used for the study. Given the size of the companies and the financial implication of this fraud, it was expected that there would be clear action plans for managing such an issue. In order to ensure the success of this study, the fraud management lifecycle theory was used to organise, discuss and assess the approaches used within the companies. First party fraud was found to be reinforced by numerous factors such as the availability of opportunities, retail employees that abuse their trusted positions, law enforcement officials who often do not view this behaviour as criminal <b>and</b> inappropriate <b>sanctions</b> by retailers sometimes on the verge of toleration; hence first party fraud is thus made easier. This study shows that first party fraud is mostly an opportunistic crime. It also emerged that some of the retailers did not realise they had a fraud problem and even when they did, found it cost-effective to ignore some of it. However, one retailer had good action plan, which helped them reduce first party fraud losses to a greater extent. This study found that managing first party fraud effectively is possible if retailers acknowledge that {{there is a}} serious problem to address.

40|$|Given {{the high}} stakes of teacher testing, {{there is no}} doubt that every teacher test should meet the {{industry}} guidelines set forth in the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing. Unfortunately, however, there is no public or private business or governmental agency that serves to certify or in any other formal way declare that any teacher test does, in fact, meet the psychometric recommendations stipulated in the Standards. Consequently, there are no legislated penalties for faulty products (tests) nor are there opportunities for test takers simply to raise questions about a test and to have their questions taken seriously by an impartial panel. The purpose of this article is to highlight some of the psychometric results reported by National Evaluation Systems (NES) in their 1999 Massachusetts Educator Certification Test (MECT) Technical Report, and more specifically, to identify those technical characteristics of the MECT that are inconsistent with the Standards. A second purpose of this article is to call for the establishment of a standing test auditing organization with <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctioning</b> power. The significance of the present analysis is twofold: a) psychometric results for the MECT are similar in nature to psychometric results presented as evidence of test development flaws in an Alabama class-action lawsuit dealing with teacher certification (an NES-designed testing system); and b) there was no impartial enforcement agency to whom complaints about the Alabama tests could be brought, other than the court, nor is there any such agency to whom complaints about the Massachusetts tests can be brought.

To undertake this analysis of sexual violence committed against women, I provide a much-needed examination of the theoretical and conceptual signification of sexual violence throughout history (from the Middle Ages to the 20 th century) and in particular {{from the time of the}} Spanish democratic transition to present day. This research offers a greater understanding of the factors behind the disregard experienced by victims of sexual violence in the 20 th century, in a wealthy country like Spain governed by the rule of law. This study was undertaken based on a detailed analysis developed by the theoretical and political feminist framework from the 1960 s to present day. In order to present the conclusions of this research, the numerous variables implicated in the issue are dissected making {{use of a}} feminist perspective – in dialogue with a human rights theoretical framework and approach. These are the variables which have permitted the systemic exercise of this form of violence and discrimination against women: the objective of sexual violence as one of the pillars supporting the patriarchal system; its origins, underlying causes and the permanent rape myths surrounding it, the various manifestations of sexual violence, as well as the constant impunity of those responsible. Using the above analysis as a point of departure, the second part of this doctoral thesis evaluates the responsibility of the Spanish state in the area of sexual violence using the due diligence standard, evidencing the absolute indifference of the State, which has failed to fulfil its obligations in terms of prevention, <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanction,</b> integrated attention <b>and</b> compensation for victims of sexual violenc...|$|R

40|$|Background: European Union law prohibits {{companies}} from marketing drugs off-label. In the United Kingdom — as {{in some other}} European countries, but unlike the United States — industry self-regulatory bodies are tasked with supervising compliance with marketing rules. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (1) characterize off-label promotion rulings in the UK compared to the whistleblower-initiated cases in the US, and (2) shed light on the UK self-regulatory mechanism for detecting, deterring, <b>and</b> <b>sanctioning</b> off-label promotion. Methods and Findings: We conducted structured reviews of rulings by the UK self-regulatory authority, the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA), between 2003 and 2012. There were 74 off-label promotion rulings involving 43 companies and 65 drugs. Nineteen companies were ruled in breach more than once, and ten companies were ruled in breach three or more times over the 10 ten-year period. Drawing on a typology previously developed to analyzeanalyse US whistleblower complaints, we coded and analyzedanalysed the apparent strategic goals of each off-label marketing scheme and the practices consistent with those alleged goals. 50 % of rulings cited efforts to expand drug use to unapproved indications, and 39 % and 38 % cited efforts to expand beyond approved disease entities and dosing strategies, respectively. The most frequently described promotional tactic was attempts to influence prescribers (n = 72, 97 %), using print material (70 / 72, 97 %), for example, advertisements (21 / 70, 30 %). Although rulings cited prescribers as the prime target of off-label promotion, competing companies lodged the majority of complaints (prescriber: n = 16, 22 %, versuss. companies: n = 42, 57 %). Unlike US whistleblower complaints, few UK rulings described practices targeting consumers (n = 3, 4 %), payers (n = 2, 3 %), or company staff (n = 2, 3 %). Eight UK rulings (11 %) pertaining to six drugs described promotion of the same drug for the same off-label use as was alleged by whistleblowers in the US. However, while the UK cases typically related to only one or a few claims made in printed material, several complaints in the US alleged multifaceted and covert marketing activities. Because this study is limited to PMCPA rulings and whistleblower-initiated federal cases, it may offer a partial view of exposed off-label marketing. Conclusion: The UK self-regulatory system for exposing marketing violations relies largely on complaints from company outsiders, which may explain why most off-label promotion rulings relate to plainly visible promotional activities such as advertising. This contrasts with the US, where Department of Justice <b>investigations</b> <b>and</b> whistleblower testimony have alleged complex off-label marketing campaigns that remain concealed to company outsiders. UK authorities should consider introducing increased incentives and protections for whistleblowers combined with US-style governmental <b>investigations</b> <b>and</b> meaningful <b>sanctions.</b> UK prescribers should be attentive to, and increasingly report, off-label promotion...|$|R

We conducted structured reviews of rulings by the UK self-regulatory authority, the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA), between 2003 and 2012. There were 74 off-label promotion rulings involving 43 companies and 65 drugs. Nineteen companies were ruled in breach more than once, and ten companies were ruled in breach three or more times over the 10 -y period. Drawing on a typology previously developed to analyse US whistleblower complaints, we coded and analysed the apparent strategic goals of each off-label marketing scheme and the practices consistent with those alleged goals. 50 % of rulings cited efforts to expand drug use to unapproved indications, and 39 % and 38 % cited efforts to expand beyond approved disease entities and dosing strategies, respectively. The most frequently described promotional tactic was attempts to influence prescribers (n = 72, 97 %), using print material (70 / 72, 97 %), for example, advertisements (21 / 70, 30 %). Although rulings cited prescribers as the prime target of off-label promotion, competing companies lodged the majority of complaints (prescriber: n = 16, 22 %, versus companies: n = 42, 57 %). Unlike US whistleblower complaints, few UK rulings described practices targeting consumers (n = 3, 4 %), payers (n = 2, 3 %), or company staff (n = 2, 3 %). Eight UK rulings (11 %) pertaining to six drugs described promotion of the same drug for the same off-label use as was alleged by whistleblowers in the US. However, while the UK cases typically related to only one or a few claims made in printed material, several complaints in the US alleged multifaceted and covert marketing activities. Because this study is limited to PMCPA rulings and whistleblower-initiated federal cases, it may offer a partial view of exposed off-label marketing. The UK self-regulatory system for exposing marketing violations relies largely on complaints from company outsiders, which may explain why most off-label promotion rulings relate to plainly visible promotional activities such as advertising. This contrasts with the US, where Department of Justice <b>investigations</b> <b>and</b> whistleblower testimony have alleged complex off-label marketing campaigns that remain concealed to company outsiders. UK authorities should consider introducing increased incentives and protections for whistleblowers combined with US-style governmental <b>investigations</b> <b>and</b> meaningful <b>sanctions.</b> UK prescribers should be attentive to, and increasingly report, off-label promotion...|$|R
40|$|In {{my thesis}} I deal with {{illegal drug use}} leading to criminality. Drug abuse has been a debated issue {{recently}} because drugs are omnipresent in our society. Illegal drug use has been a serious problem worldwide. Due to its geographical location, shortly after 1989 and {{after the fall of}} the Iron Curtain the Czech Republic has become both a transit and a destination country for all sorts of drugs within a short time. The objective of my thesis is to examine, describe and analyse the overall criminality in the Prague area in 2005 { [...] } 2007. The other concern of my research was to determine the drug addicts´ contribution in proportion to the overall criminality. I set three hypotheses: H I : The most common drug addicts´criminal activity is theft. H II : Most drug addicted criminal offenders are male. H III : The most common drug being abused is pervitin. The thesis is divided into two parts { [...] } theoretical and practical. In the theoretical part the development of the drug scene in the Czech Republic and crimes committed by drug addicts are described. I also give information on detection, <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> criminal <b>sanctions</b> in criminality caused by drug addicts. I gathered the data from specialist literature. In the practical part I used the technique of the secondary statistical data analysis. I analysed the statistical data from 2005 { [...] } 2007 obtained from the Police of the Czech Republic Headquarters. The research was conducted by the quantitative questionnaire method and the data obtained were analysed. The data were put into charts and diagrams. All the hypotheses suggested were confirmed. The objective of my thesis was accomplished...|$|R

40|$|The {{burden of}} proof, a central feature of {{adjudication}} and other decision-making contexts, constitutes an important but largely unappreciated policy instrument. The optimal {{strength of the}} burden of proof, as well as optimal enforcement effort <b>and</b> <b>sanctions,</b> involves trading off deterrence and the chilling of desirable behavior, the latter being absent in previous work. The character of the optimum differs markedly from prior results and from conventional understandings of proof burdens. There are important divergences across models in which enforcement involves monitoring, <b>investigation,</b> <b>and</b> auditing. A number of extensions are analyzed, in one instance nullifying key results in prior work. ...|$|R
