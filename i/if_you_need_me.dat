6000|$|The Clayton girls {{said good-bye}} with pity in their voices, and Rivers sought {{opportunity}} to say, privately: [...] "I {{hate to see}} you back {{out there on the}} border. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> anything, let <b>me</b> know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will always}} {{take care of}} <b>you</b> <b>if</b> I see <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>me.</b> But that {{beautiful}} coat? your husband did not wear it when you were first married? Perhaps he used {{not to be so}} long away from you then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had the {{happiness}} {{to hear him}} speak twice," [...] his companion answered in the feverish whisper contrasting with the gloomy apathy {{of his face and}} bearing. [...] "He did not know where I live.... I am lodging poorly with an artisan family.... I have just a corner in a room. It is not very practicable to see me there, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should <b>need</b> <b>me</b> for anything I am ready...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Almost any minute," [...] I replied assuringly. [...] "You must {{remember}} that I'm {{only a few hours}} away now. I can visit you often.

6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Peters philosophically, [...] "it {{looks as}} if I must drop the plan, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>me</b> later, you know where I can be found.

6000|$|Armstrong, {{was used}} to seizing {{opportunities}} promptly.

5000|$|Wolf was {{released}} {{near the end}} of the season and called it quits on Sheree. Wolf tried his best to get Cheryl back but she wanted to stay with Wayne. Wolf, Loretta and Jethro miraculously joined sides to try to get Pascalle away from Nicky who Wolf called [...] "a bad bastard." [...] It backfired and Pascalle ended up getting engaged to Nicky. At the season finale, Wolf called Pascalle and told her <b>if</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>need</b> <b>me</b> just call. And that was the last of Wolf until he appeared as a figment of Cheryl's imagination in season 5.|$|R
6000|$|He fretted to Miss McGoun, [...] "What {{time you}} going to lunch? Well, make sure Miss Bannigan is in then. Explain to her that if Wiedenfeldt calls up, she's to tell him I'm already having the title traced. And oh, b' the way, remind me to-morrow to have Penniman trace it. Now if anybody comes in looking for a cheap house, {{remember}} we got to shove that Bangor Road place off onto somebody. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>me,</b> I'll be at the Athletic Club.

6000|$|Fathers {{and sons}} wanted to come, and many men with their wives, {{to say nothing}} of the young woman stenographer who wrote: [...] "Write {{immediately}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>me.</b> I shall bring my typewriter on the first train." [...] But the best of all is the following--observe the delicate way in which he worked in his wife: [...] "I thought I would drop you a line of inquiry as to the possibility of making the trip with you, am 24 years of age, married and broke, and a trip of that kind would be just what we are looking for." ...|$|E
6000|$|To relieve {{his anxiety}} {{and to be}} sure that he did not overwork, I hired Uncle Frank McClintock to come down {{for two or three days}} a week to help kill the weeds. [...] "The crop is not {{important}} to me," [...] I said to him privately, [...] "but it is important that you should keep a close watch on Father while I am away. He is getting feeble and forgetful. See him every day, and wire me if he is in need of anything. I must go back to the city for a few weeks. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>me</b> send word and I'll come at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pish! But you are mad," [...] she scorned him. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>need</b> ask <b>if</b> I {{intend to}} resist--I, with the strongest castle in Dauphiny?

6000|$|But Robert Knolles {{shook his}} head. [...] "I have your father's command, sire, and without his order I may not go against it.

5000|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} has Grande {{demanding}} for romantic satisfaction, filled with double entendres about rough sex. In the beginning, Grande wants {{a man to}} [...] "utterly satisfy her in moments of breath taking, space invading, pleasure, pain, lip biting and bliss," [...] singing: [...] "Baby, in that moment, you'll know this is/Something bigger than us and beyond bliss." [...] In the chorus, she lets her potential mate know that if he is really serious about keeping her, he has to up his game, warning: [...] "'Cause <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to keep me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love <b>me</b> harder/And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> really <b>need</b> <b>me,</b> <b>you</b> gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder." [...] Later, The Weeknd plays a role of a shady love interest with skeletons in his closet, with lines about [...] "how it feels {{for a woman to}} have intercourse," [...] followed by carnal promises, singing: [...] "Can you feel the pressure between your hips/ I’ll make you feel like the first time." [...] In the bridge, [...] "Grande and Weeknd trade provocative 'oohs'." ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{fragment}} of Carver's unfinished novel The Augustine Notebooks {{was published in}} Iowa Review (Summer 1979), and later collected in Call <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>Me</b> (2000) and Collected Stories (2009). Additionally, Carver had accepted an advance on an unwritten novel from McGraw-Hill and planned {{to write a novel}} he imagined as [...] "an African Queen sort of thing" [...] set in German East Africa after World War I. Carver later admitted he stopped working on the novel after two weeks, and it appears that nothing of it exists beyond the published fragment.|$|E
5000|$|Carver became {{interested}} in writing in Paradise, California, where he had moved {{with his family to}} be close to his mother-in-law. While attending Chico State College, he enrolled in a creative writing course taught by the novelist John Gardner, a recent doctoral graduate of the Iowa Writers' Workshop who became a mentor and had a major influence on Carver's life and career. Carver's first published story, [...] "The Furious Seasons", appeared in 1961. More florid than his later work, the story strongly bore the influence of William Faulkner. [...] "Furious Seasons" [...] was later used as a title for a collection of stories published by Capra Press, and is now in the recent collection, No Heroics, Please and Call <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle, I entreat you," [...] said Lord Eglinton softly, [...] "for {{the sake}} of your own dignity and--and mine, do not allow your mind to dwell on such matters. Believe me, I am fully {{conscious}} of the honour which you did me just now in deigning to place your trust in me. That I have--have loved you, Mlle. Lydie," [...] he added, with a nervous quiver in his young voice, [...] "ever since I first saw you at this Court I--I cannot deny; but"--and here he spoke more firmly, seeing that once again she seemed to draw away from him, to stiffen at his approach, [...] "but that simple and natural fact <b>need</b> not trouble <b>you.</b> I could not help loving you, for you are more beautiful than anything on earth, and you cannot deem my adoration an offence, though you are as cold and pure as the goddess of chastity herself. I have seen Catholics kneeling at the shrine of the Virgin Mary; their eyes were fixed up to her radiant image, their lips murmured an invocation or sometimes a hymn of praise. But their hands were clasped together; they never even raised them once toward that shrine which they had built for her, and from which she smiled whilst listening coldly to their prayers. Mlle. d'Aumont, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> have no mistrust of my deep respect for you; you are the Madonna and I the humblest of your worshippers. I am proud {{to think that the}} name I bear will be the shrine wherein your pride will remain enthroned. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have <b>need</b> of <b>me</b> in the future you must command me, but though the law of France will call me your husband and your lord, I will be your bondsman and serve you on my knees; and though my very soul aches for the mere touch of your hand, my lips will never pollute even the hem of your gown." [...] His trembling voice had sunk down to a whisper. If she heard or not he could not say. From far away there came to his ears the tender melancholy drone of the instruments playing the slow movement of the gavotte. His Madonna had not stirred, only her hand which he so longed to touch trembled a little as she toyed with her fan.|$|R
