50|$|A {{number of}} legends {{regarding}} <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung's</b> exploits exist. <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> {{first arrived in}} China at O-Mei Shan in Szechuan province. During his time there he became quite famous for his skill. Upon arrival on the Pearl River, <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> was challenged by a pirate known as Cheung Po-Jai. Cheung was famous for robbing corrupt Qing Dynasty officials. After having defeated Cheung, <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> accepted him as a student.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} lineage/tradition, <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> is {{described}} as the 36th, 18th or 14th generation inheritor of the Lion's Roar system. There is a 350-year gap between Ah Dat-Ta and <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> and a troubling lack of information regarding this long period. However, we have very definite and established lineages once <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> began teaching in Guangdong province, Southern China. This is a brief summary {{of some of the}} prominent and still active lineages.|$|R
50|$|When the {{misunderstanding}} was corrected <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> {{offered to}} heal the leg using special Tibetan medical techniques and the two became friends. Wong Ping was so impressed by <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> that he asked the old monk to teach his son. Wong Yan-Lam studied {{for many years and}} achieved considerable skill under the direction of <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung.</b> In addition to Lama Pai, Wong Yan Lam also learned the Lo Han Myuhn (Boddhisattva division) and Gam Gong Myuhn (Diamond division) internal methods and the Tibetan medical techniques.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> (聖龍, also <b>Sing</b> Luhng, meaning [...] "Sage Dragon" [...] or [...] "Venerable Monk") was a Chinese martial artist.|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{genealogy}} of Tibetan White Crane, [...] "Ng Mui" [...] is the Chinese {{name of the}} Tibetan monk Jikboloktoto, who was {{the last}} generation of transmission before <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung,</b> who brought the art to Guangdong. This account is most different from the others, with a male Ng Mui, {{the absence of a}} Manchu menace to flee from and, given the dating of <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung's</b> relocation to Guangdong to 1865, a 19th-century setting.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> taught many {{individuals}} his art of Lama Pai. It appears that {{only two of}} his students are primarily responsible for taking the style and spreading it throughout China: Wong Lam-Hoi (黃林开) and Wong Yan-Lam (王隐林). There were five other students who absorbed much of <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung’s</b> teaching as well. They are responsible for spreading the style {{to other parts of}} China, but for one reason or another, kept fairly secret about their teachings.|$|R
5000|$|Wong Yan Lam 王隱林 {{was the son}} of a Shaolin Kung-Fu master {{known as}} Wong Ping. Wong Ping was {{something}} of a local legend, known as [...] "the bronze foot", and was fond of demonstrating his kung-fu in public. Because of this he came to the attention of <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung.</b> One day <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> came down from the mountain and had an opportunity to observe Wong Ping's kung-fu. He was impressed by Wong Ping's skill and tried to tell him so but because <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung's</b> Chinese was not very good there was a misunderstanding. Wong Ping attacked Sing Luhng with a powerful leg sweep but the Tibetan monk utilized a technique known as [...] "GAM GONG HONG LUHNG". He leapt up into the air and landed on the leg, breaking Wong Ping's knee.|$|R

5000|$|Depending {{upon the}} lineage, the figure known as <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> is {{rendered}} in Chinese characters as either [...] "Sage Dragon" [...] (聖龍) or [...] "Star Dragon" [...] (星龍). From a Buddhist point of view, the [...] "Sage Dragon" [...] (聖龍) makes more logical sense {{and the use}} of the character for [...] "star" [...] (星) can easily be explained by the long established tradition of [...] "white characters" [...] in Chinese society, i.e. the use of a simpler character with the same phonetic sound. <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> also has an alias as Gam Ngau [...] "Golden Hook" [...] Leih Wu-Ji (Li Hu Ji) (金钩李胡子).|$|R

40|$|Background: Lung {{cancer and}} {{colorectal}} cancer are {{leading causes of}} U. S. cancer mortality.

5000|$|While {{today the}} martial arts known as Lama Pai, Tibetan White Crane, and Hop Gar exist as {{relatively}} distinct lineages and/or organizations, all originated with a single figure known as <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> who arrived in Guangdong Province during the Qing Dynasty and taught a martial art then known as [...] "Lion's Roar" [...] (獅子吼).

50|$|Fortunately, {{this debate}} {{can be put}} to rest quite quickly if one {{examines}} more closely the history of Lion's Roar. Ah Dat-Ta, the founder of Lion's Roar, is described as both ethnically Chinese (i.e. Han) and as living {{in what is now}} the province of Qinghai, situated in north western China, next to modern day Tibet. There is also reason to believe <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung,</b> the Buddhist monk who brought Lion's Roar to Guangdong, was raised and trained in Qinghai. To understand the significance of this one has to know a little {{about the history of the}} region.|$|R
50|$|It {{was during}} this period of time that <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> taught Chan Yam (陳蔭), Chou Heung-Yuen (周香遠), and Chu Chi-Yu (朱子堯).

Chu Chi-Yu accepted only a few disciples and generally kept what he had learned concealed from the general public. Among his students were Chu Cheung, Lei Seung-Dong, and Chiu Dihk. These students continued to guard what they had learned very closely and only accept a few disciples. Chu Chi-Yu apparently also taught Nhg Siu-Chung for a period of time.|$|R

40|$|An {{effective}} and practical procedure {{has been developed}} that allows the assignment of the absolute configuration of solenopsins from diverse origins using only small amounts of material. The method {{is based on the}} transformation of the natural secondary amines into diastereoisomeric amides by reaction with (R) - 2 -methoxy- 2 -phenyl- 2 -(trifluoromethyl) acetic acid chloride (MTPA-Cl), followed by comparison of their chromatographic behaviour with those of standards of established absolute configuration. This procedure has been applied to three samples of ants: Solenopsis geminata <b>workers,</b> <b>S.</b> invicta <b>workers</b> and <b>S.</b> invicta alates. It has been found that the absolute configuration of the trans alkaloids is always (2 R, 6 R) while that of the cis alkaloids is (2 R, 6 S).

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Biomedical Technology)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, 2003 Increased seafood {{consumption}} {{due to its}} {{nutrition and}} promotion of a healthy diet has lead to more frequent reports of allergic reactions. In the seafood industry, workers {{are exposed to the}} antigens through inhalation of the vapours created during the seafood processing and cooking. Most seafood allergens are stable molecules, which are resistant to the effect of cooking and processing. The prevalence of occupational asthma varies from 7 - 36 % among different groups of workers including seafood processing and <b>fishmeal</b> <b>workers,</b> fishermen and restaurant cooks (Jeebhay et al 2001). Purpose of Study: The purpose of the study is to determine total protein and the specific fish antigen concentrations in the environment by means of personal air sampling filters obtained from various categories of workers in the seafood processing industry. Objectives: • To determine the correlation between total protein concentrations and specific fish (pilchard and anchovy) antigen concentrations on personal air sampling filters using the linear response model of the standard curve. • To determine the correlation between total protein concentrations and specific fish (pilchard and anchovy) antigen concentrations on personal air sampling filters using the sigmoidal response model with a variable slope of the standard curve. • To identify the most efficient standard curve response model for fish antigen detection by comparing the percentage recovery of the linear standard curve response model and the sigmoidal standard curve response model. Methodology: A sample population of 195 samples was taken from workers in the seafood industry at the St. Helena Bay Fisheries and West Point Processors using personal air sampling pumps...|$|R
40|$|Are you {{planning}} to become an agricultural extension worker or trainer or, if you are one already, {{would you like to}} refresh your knowledge or learn new tools? Learning together is a good, practical handbook for that purpose, dealing with both practice and theory. One section deals with communication and best and worst practices. Another describes the various steps to define the need, content, planning and implementation of training. Links with agriculture and related issues cover participation, gender issues, local knowledge and cultural aspects. Taking these into account will heighten the impact of your training. Finally, while practical examples, tools, role-plays can be found throughout the entire book, there is also a concluding section dedicated to making your own materials. It includes making puppets, producing posters, ways to discuss animal anatomy and games for forming and warming up groups.

40|$|Administration of alpha-naphthylthiourea (ANTU) to rats causes {{damage to}} {{pulmonary}} endothelial cells and possibly mesothelial lining cells that together {{may account for}} the massive pleural effusion characteristic of thiourea toxicity.

Binding of 35 <b>S</b> in <b>lung</b> slices from resistant rats is much less than in controls, and resistance cannot be explained by differences in either whole body metabolism or redistribution of thiourea in vivo.
