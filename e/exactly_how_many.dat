5|$|Although 0 is {{divisible}} by 2 {{more times}} than any other number, it is not straightforward to quantify <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> times that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be {{the number of times}} n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; {{no matter how many times}} it is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. This convention is not peculiar to the 2-order; it is one of the axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E
5|$|In {{his spare}} time, Wright {{developed}} a fruit farm {{on the property}} with over a thousand fruit trees and bushes that he ordered from Jens Jensen in 1912. It is unknown <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> were planted, because part of the order was destroyed during a railroad strike. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five apple trees planted, including one hundred McIntosh, fifty Wealthy, fifty Golden Russet, and fifty Fameuse. Among the bushes were three hundred gooseberry, two hundred blackberry, and two hundred raspberry. The property also grew pears, asparagus, rhubarb, and plums. The fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the contour of the estate, {{which may have been}} done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy. Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl. This water garden, probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural gateway to the property.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Obergruppenführer Wilhelm Bittrich's II SS Panzer Corps—comprising {{the remains}} of Walter Harzer's 9th SS and Heinz Harmel's 10th SS Panzer Divisions—had moved into the area north of Arnhem to refit and reorganise. Although badly mauled after {{escaping}} the Falaise pocket, the Korps {{was made up of}} seasoned veterans and made available significantly more forces to the Germans than the allies had been led to expect. The divisions were also specially trained in anti-airborne operations; during their formation both divisions had undergone month-long anti airborne exercises whilst waiting for their heavy equipment, and had also spent the last 15 months studying the best reactions to a parachute attack in classroom and field exercises. The 9th SS had a Panzergrenadier brigade, a reconnaissance battalion, an artillery battalion, two batteries of self-propelled guns and a company of tanks. <b>Exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> men were available after the withdrawal from Normandy is unclear. Some sources suggest that the 9th had up to 6,000 men, others suggest that the combined total of the 9th and 10th SS was only 6,000–7,000 men.|$|E

When King Haakon V signed a peace treaty with the Danish king in 1309, it was sealed by 29 Norwegian knights and squires. King Haakon promised that additional 270 knights and squires would give their written recognition. This were perhaps the approximate number of knights and squires at this time.|$|E

Though Washington experienced a massive real estate boom that helped alleviate the city's fiscal problems for a time, government spending skyrocketed; the administration posted a fifth straight budget surplus, but the next year struggled with a $110 million deficit. Much of the disparity was caused by Barry's policy of combatting unemployment by creating government jobs; the city government's payrolls swelled so greatly that by 1986, nobody in the administration knew <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> employees it had.|$|E

5|$|Following its May 1943 {{debut in}} action, {{during the second}} half of 1943, Schnaufer and his crew began experimenting with {{upward-firing}} autocannons, dubbed Schräge Musik. This allowed the night fighter to approach and attack the bombers from below—outside the enemy crew's usual field of view. An attack by a Schräge Musik-equipped night fighter typically came as a complete surprise to the bomber crew, who realised a night fighter was close by only when they came under fire. It is not exactly known when Schnaufer's Bf 110 was equipped with Schräge Musik. Rumpelhardt stated that the weapons system was installed prior to his return from officer training. It is also not <b>exactly</b> known <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of his victories had been claimed using the upwards firing cannons.

25|$|Therapeutic dose {{dependence}} is {{the largest}} category of people dependent on benzodiazepines.

25|$|Red {{deer are}} ruminants, {{characterized}} by a four-chambered stomach.

The closely related and slightly larger American elk or wapiti, native to North America and eastern parts of Asia, had been regarded as a subspecies of red deer, but recently it has been established as a distinct species. It is probable that the ancestor of all red deer, including wapiti, originated in central Asia and resembled sika deer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{paper is}} the third in a series on the Tragers {{approach}} {{from the perspective of}} an experienced practitioner. To the author’s knowledge {{this is the first time}} the tablework performed in Trager has been described in-depth, in a forum outside the proprietary materials that each student of Trager receives. Milton Trager’s work at the table changed over the years, from more vigorous and less specific, to less vigorous and more specific. The work of Trager practitioners vary, depending upon when and how they were influenced by his work. Trager guided his prot!eg!es from the principles of physical culture, to a growing emphasis on the power of presence. He guided his clients from passively receiving new movements on the table, to actively creating those movements, as Mentasticss, off the table (Mentastics to be detailed in a future issue of JBMT). Trager developed varieties of ways to hold and move the body that were usually gentle and painless. Clients could sense their bodies moving but could not <b>exactly</b> feel <b>how.</b> <b>Many</b> of these ways of interacting with clients, and their bodies, are strikingly similar in principle to Eastern meditation and martial arts.
