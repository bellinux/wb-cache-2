5|$|Medical pioneer Dr Truby King {{established}} a farm at Tahakopa and a Catlins timber mill from the 1890s to the 1920s, and <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> of his mental patients vocational training there.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} offseason, Ruppert had been {{sounding}} {{out the other}} clubs in hopes of finding one that {{would be willing to}} take Ruth as a manager and/or a player. However, the only serious offer came from Athletics owner-manager Connie Mack, who <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> thought to stepping down as manager in favor of Ruth. However, Mack later dropped the idea, saying that Ruth's wife would be running the team in a month if Ruth ever took over.|$|E
5|$|In London Smith {{tended to}} neglect the zoological {{parts of the}} collection, he added some {{specimens}} and also <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> specimens away. Over the following centuries the Linnean collection in London suffered enormously {{at the hands of}} scientists who studied the collection, and in the process disturbed the original arrangement and labels, added specimens that did not belong to the original series and withdrew precious original type material.|$|E

5|$|Because of his {{involvement}} with the Pinochet government, there were international protests when Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1976. Friedman was accused of supporting the military dictatorship in Chile because of the relation of economists of the University of Chicago to Pinochet, and a controversial seven-day trip he took to Chile during March 1975 (less {{than two years after}} the coup that deposed President Salvador Allende). Friedman answered that he never was an adviser to the dictatorship, but only <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> lectures and seminars on inflation, and met with officials, including Augusto Pinochet, while in Chile.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{restricted}} by his experiences as an R sideman, Hendrix moved in 1966 to New York City's Greenwich Village, {{which had a}} vibrant and diverse music scene. There, he was offered a residency at the Cafe Wha? on MacDougal Street and formed his own band that June, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, which included future Spirit guitarist Randy California. The Blue Flames played at several clubs in New York and Hendrix began developing his guitar style and material that he would soon use with the Experience. In September, they <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> of their last concerts at the Cafe au Go Go, as John Hammond Jr.'s backing group.|$|E
5|$|In November 1853, Sir George Grey {{ended his}} first term as Governor of New Zealand and sailed to the islands around New Caledonia, to indulge his {{interest}} in languages. He also wanted to investigate French claims on the islands. Heaphy accompanied him as his private secretary and {{took the opportunity to}} execute artworks of the islands he visited and their inhabitants. He <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> of his works to Grey, who took them back to England in December 1853 and donated them to the British Museum.|$|E
30|$|In this section, we <b>give</b> <b>some</b> new {{sequence}} spaces {{on a real}} n-normed {{space and}} investigate some topological properties of these spaces. We also <b>give</b> <b>some</b> inclusion relations.|$|R
30|$|In this section, we will <b>give</b> <b>some</b> bounds on the Hermitian-Randić {{energy of}} mixed graphs. First, we will <b>give</b> <b>some</b> {{properties}} of a Hermitian-Randić matrix of mixed graphs.|$|R
30|$|We <b>give</b> <b>some</b> further {{consideration}} about logarithmic convexity {{for differences}} of power sums inequality {{as well as}} related mean value theorems. Also we define quasiarithmetic sum and <b>give</b> <b>some</b> related results.|$|R
5|$|Innocent <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> dispensations as {{the crisis}} progressed. Monastic {{communities}} {{were allowed to}} celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the Holy Viaticum for the dying was authorised. The rules on burials and lay access to churches {{appear to have been}} steadily circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was a burden to much of the population, it did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England.|$|E
5|$|Later medieval chroniclers, such as Roger of Wendover, <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> {{information}} about East Anglian events, but Yorke {{suggests that the}} annalistic format used forced these writers to guess the dates of the key events they recorded. Such later sources are therefore treated with caution. The Anglian collection, which dates from the late 8th century, contains an East Anglian genealogical tally, but Rædwald is not included. Rædwald is however {{referred to in the}} 8th century Vita of St Gregory the Great, written {{by a member of the}} religious community at Whitby. The Battle of the River Idle, in which Rædwald and his forces defeated the Northumbrians, is described in the 12th century Historia Anglorum, written by Henry of Huntingdon.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic data helped clarify {{relationships}} within the genus Triturus. A 2011 phylogeny based on complete mitochondrial DNA resolved all divergences with high statistical support. The crested and the marbled newts are sister groups, {{and within the}} crested newts, the Balkan–Asian group with T. anatolicus, T. karelinii and T. ivanbureschi is sister to the remaining species, results consistent with other studies. The mitochondrial analysis also supports the northern (T. cristatus) and the Danube crested newt (T. dobrogicus), {{as well as the}} Italian (T. carnifex) and the Macedonian crested newt (T. macedonicus), respectively, as sister species, but analysis of nuclear DNA <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> conflicting results regarding those divergences.|$|E
30|$|The {{outline of}} the paper is as follows. In Section  2, we <b>give</b> <b>some</b> preliminaries. The main results of the paper are {{presented}} in Section  3. Section  4 <b>gives</b> <b>some</b> conclusions.|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{by using}} Theorem  1 in Sect.  3.1, we <b>give</b> <b>some</b> {{results for the}} {{generating}} function. Having obtained these results, we <b>give</b> <b>some</b> new identities for the (p,q)-Bernstein polynomials from arising (p,q)-calculus.|$|R
30|$|In Theorem A, we <b>give</b> <b>some</b> Gronwall-type {{generalized}} integral inequalities on {{time scales}}. Next, we <b>give</b> <b>some</b> backward Gronwall-type generalized integral inequalities on time scales {{which can not}} be directly obtained from Gronwall inequalities.|$|R
5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E
5|$|Māori quickly adopted {{writing as}} a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were {{converted}} to the written form. Most early English literature was obtained from Britain and {{it was not until the}} 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known. Although still largely influenced by global trends (modernism) and events (the Great Depression), writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand. During this period literature changed from a journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit. Participation in the world wars <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> New Zealand writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of universities local literature flourished. Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature.|$|E

25|$|The King of Spain also <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> Escurials to the Dutch {{government}} in 1790; these thrived in the Dutch Cape Colony (South Africa). Two years earlier in 1788 John MacArthur, from the Clan Arthur (or MacArthur Clan) introduced Merinos to Australia from South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Historic {{names such}} as Indrapurba, Indrapurwa, Indrapatra, and Indrapuri, which refer to Hindu god Indra, <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> hint of Indian {{influence}} on this region. However, unlike Jambi and South Sumatra, there are no significant archaeological sites and findings such as temples, that link this region with Hindu-Buddhist culture.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the rise}} of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the late 10th century BC, much of the land known today as Syria and Lebanon was ruled by various {{independent}} Canaanite speaking city states. Trade established between these cities and those of the Mediterranean <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> of these cities great wealth.|$|E

25|$|Sir William Pickles Hartley, jam {{manufacturer}} and philanthropist, {{who founded the}} Hartley's Jam Company was born in Colne in 1846 and attended a local British and Foreign School Society school. Hartley's Jam {{is still on the}} market though no longer linked to Colne. He <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> of his profits to build Hartley Hospital and Hartley Homes on the boundary with Laneshawbridge.|$|E
25|$|Killam also {{supported}} Laredo Medical Center, formerly the Roman Catholic-affiliated Mercy Hospital. He {{gave to the}} M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. The Killams <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> $500,000 to the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. The Killams also gave to their common alma mater, UT Austin. They once gave a $50,000 matching grant to save the Laredo Philharmonic Orchestra from disbanding.|$|E
25|$|Robert Schumann also practiced Hummel (especially the Sonata in F-sharp minor, Op. 81), and {{considered}} becoming his pupil. Liszt's father Adam {{refused to pay}} the high tuition fee Hummel was used to charging (thus Liszt ended up studying with Czerny). Czerny, Friedrich Silcher, Ferdinand Hiller, Sigismond Thalberg, and Adolf von Henselt were among Hummel's most prominent students. He also briefly <b>gave</b> <b>some</b> lessons to Felix Mendelssohn.|$|E
