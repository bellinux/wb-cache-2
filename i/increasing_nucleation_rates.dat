Proteins regulating the assembly kinetics of the cytoskeletal biopolymer F-actin are known to impact the architecture of actin cytoskeletal networks in vivo, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that changes to actin assembly kinetics with physiologically relevant proteins profilin and formin (mDia 1 and Cdc 12) have dramatic consequences on the architecture and gelation kinetics of otherwise biochemically identical cross-linked F-actin networks. Reduced F-actin <b>nucleation</b> <b>rates</b> promote {{the formation of a}} sparse network of thick bundles, whereas <b>increased</b> <b>nucleation</b> <b>rates</b> result in a denser network of thinner bundles. Changes to F-actin elongation rates also have marked consequences. At low elongation rates, gelation ceases and a solution of rigid bundles is formed. By contrast, rapid filament elongation accelerates dynamic arrest and promotes gelation with minimal F-actin density. These results are consistent with a recently developed model of how kinetic constraints regulate network architecture and underscore how molecular control of polymer assembly is exploited to modulate cytoskeletal architecture and material properties...|$|R

40|$|Aluminium films {{deposited}} on silicon with MOCVD methods generally exihibit a high surface roughness {{due to the}} hindered nucleation. To decrease the nucleation barrier a pretreatment of the wafer with TiClsub 4 vapor as a chemical activator is commonly suggested. This work examines {{the influence of a}} rf hydrogen plasma on the nucleation of aluminium on Si and SiOsub 2 using TMAA as precursor. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to determine the surface roughnesses and crystallite sizes of the aluminum deposits. Without plasma activation the nucleation barrier on. Si (111) is substantially higher than on oxidized Si and therefore the pretreatment of the wafer plays an important role. The hydrogen plasma causes a substantial increase of the nucleus density leading to deposits with lower surface roughnesses compared to conventional MOCVD aluminium. The influence of the substrate on the nucleation is almost "switched off" by the plasma activation and the grain sizes of Al on Si (111) and S i 0 sub 2 differ only slightly.

Sigma formed in near-equilibrium quantities during the isothermal holds, starting from a microstructure which contained a balanced mixture of metastable ferrite and austenite. In situ synchrotron diffraction continuously monitored the transformation, and these results were compared to those predicted by thermodynamic calculations. Differences between the calculated and measured amounts of sigma, ferrite and austenite suggest that the thermodynamic calculations underpredict the sigma dissolution temperature by approximately 50 C.
