The {{best known}} winegrowing areas of Slavonia are centered on Đakovo, Ilok and Kutjevo, where Graševina grapes are predominant, but other cultivars are increasingly present. In past decades, an increasing quantity of wine production in Slavonia was accompanied by increasing quality and <b>growing</b> <b>recognition</b> at home and abroad. Grape vines were first grown {{in the region of}} Ilok, as early as the 3rd century AD. The oldest Slavonian wine cellar still in continuous use for winemaking is located in Kutjevo—built in 1232 by Cistercians.|$|E

25|$|The act of {{domestic}} violence towards women is a human rights violation {{as well as an}} illegal act under Indian law. It is therefore widely considered a threat to women’s agency through any lens, and there is a <b>growing</b> <b>recognition</b> in many Indian regions that the nation can reach a higher potential through obtaining greater social and economic capital than by reducing women’s participation in society. Domestic violence {{is one of the most}} significant determinants of this denial. Greater gender equality through greater women’s agency cannot be achieved if basic health needs are not being met and if cultural biases that allow for domestic violence in India persist.|$|E

Moreover, infrastructure for electric vehicle charging is also being considered to be provided either through existing energy retailers like fuel pumps or by providing subsidies to vehicle manufacturers investments in the field.|$|E
25|$|Multiculturalism – Although the {{theoretical}} foundations of psychology {{are rooted in}} European culture, there is a <b>growing</b> <b>recognition</b> that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need to take those differences into greater consideration. Further, the generations following immigrant migration will have some combination {{of two or more}} cultures—with aspects coming from the parents and from the surrounding society—and this process of acculturation can play a strong role in therapy (and might itself be the presenting problem). Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of control, authority, and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in mainstream psychotherapeutic theory and practice. As such, there is a growing movement to integrate knowledge of various cultural groups in order to inform therapeutic practice in a more culturally sensitive and effective way.|$|E

25|$|Although {{these three}} phylogenetic {{features}} are useful rules of thumb to identify epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes {{that might be}} impacting viral genetic variation, there is <b>growing</b> <b>recognition</b> that the mapping between process and phylogenetic pattern can be many-to-one. For instance, although ladder-like trees {{such as the one}} shown in figure 3A could reflect the presence of directional selection, ladder-like trees could also reflect sequential genetic bottlenecks that might occur with rapid spatial spread, {{as in the case of}} rabies virus. Because of this many-to-one mapping between process and phylogenetic pattern, research in the field of viral phylodynamics has sought to develop and apply quantitative methods to effectively infer process from reconstructed viral phylogenies (see Methods). The consideration of other data sources (e.g., incidence patterns) may aid in distinguishing between competing phylodynamic hypotheses. Combining disparate sources of data for phylodynamic analysis remains a major challenge in the field and is an active area of research.|$|E
500|$|These years saw Smetana's <b>growing</b> <b>recognition</b> as the {{principal}} exponent of Czech national music. This status was celebrated by several events during Smetana's final years. On 4January 1880, a special concert in Prague marked the 50th anniversary of his first public performance; Smetana attended, and played his Piano Trio in G minor from 1855. In May 1882 The Bartered Bride was given its 100th performance, an unprecedented event {{in the history of}} Czech opera. It was so popular that a repeat [...] "100th performance" [...] was staged. A gala concert and banquet was arranged to honour Smetana's 60th birthday in March 1884, but he was too ill to attend.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the dedication, Taft {{described}} the Ferguson Fund commission to sculpt the fountain as a turning point in his career that led to increased publicity, more commissions, and <b>growing</b> <b>recognition</b> in the community, which combined to give him the encouragement for further commitment to the arts. [...] He hoped that the Fountain of the Great Lakes would mark a new era of civic beautification and that it would also mark the beginning of the Chicago school of sculpture. [...] The dream that Chicago would be the epicenter of the sculpting universe had been bred during the World's Columbian Exposition twenty years earlier and rekindled with the Ferguson bequest. [...] Fountain of the Great Lakes was a major career accomplishment for Taft, which propelled him beyond the level of a portraitist.|$|E

500|$|Psychoanalyst/psychologists Peter Fonagy and Mary Target have {{attempted}} to bring attachment theory and psychoanalysis into a closer relationship through cognitive science as mentalization. Mentalization, or theory of mind, is the capacity of human beings to guess with some accuracy what thoughts, emotions and intentions lie behind behaviours as subtle as facial expression. It has been speculated that this connection between theory of mind and the internal working model may open new areas of study, leading to alterations in attachment theory. Since the late 1980s, {{there has been a}} developing rapprochement between attachment theory and psychoanalysis, based on common ground as elaborated by attachment theorists and researchers, and a change in what psychoanalysts consider to be central to psychoanalysis. Object relations models which emphasise the autonomous need for a relationship have become dominant and are linked to a <b>growing</b> <b>recognition</b> within psychoanalysis of the importance of infant development in the context of relationships and internalized representations. Psychoanalysis has recognized the formative nature of a child's early environment including the issue of childhood trauma. A psychoanalytically based exploration of the attachment system and an accompanying clinical approach has emerged together with a recognition of the need for measurement of outcomes of interventions.|$|E
500|$|With {{this theme}} of {{a loss of}} {{pleasure}} and inevitable death, the poem, according to Claude Finney, describes [...] "the inadequacy of the romantic escape {{from the world of}} reality to the world of ideal beauty". Earl Wasserman essentially agrees with Finney, but he extended his summation of the poem to incorporate the themes of Keats's Mansion of Many Apartments when he says, [...] "the core of the poem is the search for the mystery, the unsuccessful quest for light within its darkness" [...] and this [...] "leads only to an increasing darkness, or a <b>growing</b> <b>recognition</b> of how impenetrable the mystery is to mortals." [...] With these views in mind, the poem recalls Keats's earlier view of pleasure and an optimistic view of poetry found within his earlier poems, especially Sleep and Poetry, and rejects them. This loss of pleasure and incorporation of death imagery lends the poem a dark air, which connects [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] with Keats' other poems that discuss the demonic nature of poetic imagination, including Lamia. In the poem, Keats imagines the loss of the physical world and sees himself dead—he uses an abrupt, almost brutal word for it—as a [...] "sod" [...] over which the nightingale sings. [...] The contrast between the immortal nightingale and mortal man, sitting in his garden, is made all the more acute by an effort of the imagination.|$|E
