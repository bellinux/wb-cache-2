Although Natural Fibres have various {{potential}} and advantages such as lower in weight, embodied energy and toxicity but their drawbacks are provided relentless competition between natural and synthetics fibres. Intrinsically, Natural Fibres are hydrophilic that is leaded to poor resistance to moisture and incompatible to hydrophobic polymer matrix. This incompatibility of natural fibres results in poor fibre/matrix interface {{which in turn}} leads to reduce mechanical properties of the composites. This study try to litreature some methods of chemical treatment or surface modification of Natural Fibres for improving this drawback of natural fibres. The objective {{of this research is}} fungi treatment as Green Surface Treatment that is indicate to <b>environmental</b> <b>friendlier</b> process.

2500|$|In {{personality}} psychology, {{researchers have}} generally {{agreed on a}} five-factor model of personality. The five factors are extraversion (i.e. social, outgoing), agreeableness (i.e. trusting, helpful), neuroticism (i.e. worried, anxious), openness to experience (i.e. imaginative, creative), and conscientiousness (i.e. organized, careful). [...] Nature relatedness (overall) is significantly related to extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. In addition, a subscale of nature relatedness (nature relatedness-experience) is negatively related with neuroticism. These authors describe the nature relatedness person {{as someone who is}} more adventurous, easy going, and gregarious. It may also be that highly nature related people are more <b>environmental</b> <b>friendly</b> because of the positive (albeit weak) relationship with conscientiousness. Evidence suggests that people vary in their subjective sense of connectedness with nature much like any of the five factors listed above. Supportive of these results, a recent study has found that environmental engagement (protecting the environment, electricity conservation and environmental values) is related to agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience. Another study found that nature connectedness accounted for (mediated) the relationship between openness and pro-environmental behaviours.|$|E

40|$|As global concern {{increases}} regarding pollution {{does the}} demand {{to develop more}} efficient and <b>environmental</b> <b>friendlier</b> propulsion system come in high focus. The main systems for transportation have been dominated by the Otto and Diesel engine for a long time, but both are trade-off in local and global emissions, i. e. NOX, soot, HC and CO versus CO 2. This has driven the evolution to concepts as homogeneous charge compres-sion ignition, HCCI and later partially premixed combustion, PPC. Although HCCI {{has been shown to}} have ultra-low engine-out emissions in soot and NOX, has it been proven to be unreliable in terms of combustion control and lack in efficiency at higher loads. PPC on the other hand is proven to be a good contester in both fields. This takes us to where we are now, where the PPC analyzing and testing phase is ongoing. PPC has been run with diesel as fuel, but with only a 25 % of the conventional diesel combustion range, due to self-ignition [6]. This problem has been solved by running high octane fuels with high resistance to ignite. These have shown to reduce emissions in soot and NOx as a result of longer air and fuel mixing period and high EGR values for a low combus-tion temperature. Ethanol has been tested with good results in efficiency, combustio...|$|R

It was reported that moderate black pod cases (47%) occurred in the T. asperellum treatment to control black pod disease compared to trees with untreated (71%) and chemical fungicide (1.73%). Another species, which is T. virens also has been documented to reduce some black pod incident in Peru. In Brazil, a new species known as Trichoderma martiale Samuels, sp. nov. was identified as an endophyte on cocoa, which has the ability to reduce black pod symptoms caused by P. megakarya. This endophyte species survives on cocoa pods, and has the ability to establish a long endophytic association with the host (about 3.5 months). Nevertheless, the protection against black pod via biological control is not as effective as the control using chemical fungicides ...|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is the {{development}} of a new industrial applicable pre-treatment process for cotton based on catalysis. The pre-treatment generally consists of desizing, scouring and bleaching. These processes can be continuous or batch wise. Advances in the science of biocatalytic pre-treatment of cotton and catalytic bleaching formed the scientific basis for this work. The work of Agrawal on enzymes for bio-scouring and of Topalovic on catalytic bleaching led to the conclusion that reduced reaction temperatures for the pre-treatment processes of cotton are possible. A second reason for the present work is a persistent and strong pressure on the industry to implement ‘more sustainable’ and <b>environmental</b> <b>friendlier</b> processes. It was clear that for the industrial implementation of the newly developed process it would be necessary to ‘translate’ the academic knowledge based on the catalysts, into a process at conditions that are applicable in textile industry. Previous experiences learned that the transition from academic knowledge into industrial applicable processes often failed. This is caused by lack of experience of university researchers with industrial product and process development as well as a lack of awareness of industrial developers of academic research. This is especially evident for the so-called Small and Medium Enterprises (SME’s). To overcome this gap a first step was to organize collaboration between academic institutes and industries. The basis for the collaboration was the prospect of this work for benefits for all parties involved...|$|R
