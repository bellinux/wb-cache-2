The damper has two flexible metallic bellows connected to a rigid reservoir filled with fluid. When one of the bellows is connected to a vibrating structure a periodic flow passes through a variable internal orifice and the damping effect is produced. The size of the orifice is adjusted by a controlled linear piezoelectric actuator that positions the conical core into a conical cavity. The device finite element structural model consists {{of the valve body}} and its conical core that are assumed rigid and the flexible bellows are represented by two pistons with <b>elastic</b> <b>suspensions.</b> The flow developed inside the damper is modeled considering the fluid-structure interation, using the Lagrangean-Eulerian formulation. To validate the proposed model a prototype was constructed and experimental tests and numerical simulations are accomplished in the time domain, applying harmonic excitations. The results are compared using curves that relate the damping coefficient with the orifice size and with the input velocity applied at the bellows face. However, for the proper control design and system operation, the direct use of the finite element model becomes unviable due to its high computational time. Then, a reduced second order discrete dynamic model for the damper was developed. The model parameters are identified by analysis in the frequency domain, using impulsive excitation force, for constant and variable orifice sizes.

[...] The first Moto Guzzi bike to employ the suspension was named the G.T. (for Gran Turismo, Grand Touring), and to prove the suspension [...] and gain publicity for Moto Guzzi [...] the brothers conceived a challenging [...] journey from Mandello del Lario to Capo Nord in northern Norway. Despite the very poor condition of European roads at that time, Giuseppe Guzzi reached the Arctic Circle in four weeks. The <b>elastic</b> frame rear <b>suspension</b> was immediately introduced to production machines, transforming the usability of the motorcycle as an everyday form of transportation. [...] In 2006, Moto Guzzi retraced the 'raid' of 1928 to introduce the Norge 1200. The word [...] "Norge" [...] is Norwegian for [...] "Norway".|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{presentation}} is to show how a newly developed method of complete bifurcation groups (MBG) and concepts of rare attractors (RA) helps to find unknown dangerous regimes in machine dynamics [1 - 4]. The paper considers scenarios of appearance of rare dangerous attractors [in typical dissipative oscillation systems with one degree of freedom, nonlinear elastic characteristics of hard type and harmonic excitation. Two types of <b>elastic</b> symmetric nonlinear <b>suspension</b> are examined: with trilinear symmetric and asymmetric characteristics and with a cubic characteristic of Duffing’s type. The bifurcations diagrams with rare attractors and their domains of attraction are plotted using NLO [5] and SPRING [6] software. For trilinear systems the exact analytical solutions of rare attractors and the exact monodromy matrixes for stability evaluation have found as well. Basins of attraction have built and their comparison also has done for two systems with different parameters. It is shown that rare attractors may be dangerous. Two bifurcation diagrams have been compared: the one have built using the usual ‘brute-force method’ which allows to do parameter continuation only along the stable branches [8], and the second bifurcation diagram, with rare attractors, have build using our method of complete bifurcation groups [7]. Our conclusion: using the complete bifurcation analysis {{it is possible to}} find parameter regions, in the typical dynamical systems with nonlinear suspension, with the unexpected dangerous regimes (rare attractors) and to prepare necessary parameters or state conditions. The same approaches may be useful for other tasks of nonlinear machine dynamics, such as active control of vibrations, impact- and vibro-technology, dynamics of smart elastic-damping materials...|$|R
