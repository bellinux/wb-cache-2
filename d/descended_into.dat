5|$|In 1628 {{the castle}} site was {{granted by the}} Crown to Giles Clutterbuck; the local gentry complained, leading to a legal {{case in which the}} county {{successfully}} reclaimed the site. In 1642 England <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> a period of civil war between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament. Worcester's city walls were refortified and a sconce, or small fort, was built on top of the motte of Worcester Castle.|$|E
5|$|The route {{continued}} past Redbird {{into the}} town of Stockton, where it left Cassadaga Creek and headed uphill as it curved to the west. In Centralia, NY380 met CR54 and CR57 at a four-way intersection. Here, NY380 {{turned back to the}} north and <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> another valley surrounding the Bear Lake Outlet. The route crossed the outlet and followed the waterway into the hamlet of Stockton, centered on the intersection between NY380 and NY424 (now part of CR58).|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{struggled}} to regain fluency {{in the second}} half, as their opponents dominated play. In the 53rd minute, United scored to make it 4–3; Charlie Mitten's flick in the area was diverted into the Arsenal net by Lionel Smith for an own goal. United fashioned further chances through Burke and Rowley, but for large periods {{of the second half}} the Arsenal defence stood firm. Jones' headed goal was rule out for offside, after which the match <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> a contest between United's attack and Arsenal's defence. Jimmy Delaney came closest to equalising late on, when he darted forward and missed by inches.|$|E

5|$|During {{his final}} years, and {{especially}} {{after the death of}} Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world, in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition, an epithet, the meaning of which has <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> an historical cliché.|$|E
5|$|In 1814 {{under the}} new and ambitious Governor-General Francis Edward Rawdon-Hastings, the Earl of Moira, the long-standing {{diplomatic}} disputes between British India and the Kingdom of Nepal, caused by expansionist policies of both parties, <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> open hostility. The British East India Company sought to invade Nepal not just to secure the border and to force the Nepali government to open trading routes to Tibet, but also for what Hastings saw as a geo-political necessity to secure the foothold of the Company in the Indian sub-continent.|$|E
5|$|In early 1801, Adams {{had sent}} Thomas Jefferson a brief note after {{returning}} to Quincy to which Jefferson did not respond. In 1804, Abigail wrote to Jefferson to express her condolences upon {{the death of his}} daughter Polly, who had stayed with the Adamses is London in 1787. This initiated a brief correspondence which quickly <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> political rancor. Jefferson terminated it by not replying to Abigail's fourth letter. Aside from that, there had been no communication between Peacefield and Monticello since Adams left office.|$|E

5|$|On 7 December 1975, Indonesian forces invaded East Timor. Operasi Seroja (Operation Lotus) was {{the largest}} {{military}} operation ever carried out by that nation. Troops from Fretilin's military organisation Falintil engaged ABRI forces {{in the streets of}} Dili, and reported 400 Indonesian paratroopers were killed as they <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> the city. Angkasa Magazine reports 35 dead Indonesian troops, and 122 from the Fretilin side. By the end of the year, 10,000 troops occupied Dili and another 20,000 had been deployed throughout East Timor. Massively outnumbered, Falintil troops fled to the mountains and continued guerrilla combat operations.|$|E
5|$|Situational {{awareness}} {{was also}} reduced because the pilots {{did not have}} a chart in front of them at all times. The crew was not aware that they could check the aircraft location in relation to the centerline with a VDF. The crew probably put too much emphasis on the indications displayed by the GPS. The aircraft <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> mountainous terrain without control over the lateral navigation. Despite uncertainty and disagreement in the group, the approach was not abandoned, as the aircraft should have climbed to a safe altitude while the problem was solved.|$|E
5|$|Texas <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> anarchy for {{two months}} between the {{surrender}} of the Army of Northern Virginia and the assumption of authority by Union General Gordon Granger. Violence marked {{the early months of}} Reconstruction. Juneteenth commemorates the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Galveston by General Gordon Granger, almost {{two and a half years}} after the original announcement. President Johnson, in 1866, declared the civilian government restored in Texas. Despite not meeting reconstruction requirements, Congress resumed allowing elected Texas representatives into the federal government in 1870. Social volatility continued as the state struggled with agricultural depression and labor issues.|$|E

5|$|The game <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> a scrappy {{affair in}} the last few minutes, with few clear cut chances for either side. With no further goals, it was decided by penalties. Scholes, Edu and Ferdinand {{converted}} their kicks, before Howard saved Van Bronkhorst's effort. Van Nistelrooy missed his and Wiltord scored to level the tally at 2–2 in the shoot-out. Solskjær, Lauren and Forlán scored, but Pirès missed – his effort saved by Howard – which won United the Shield, 4–3 on penalties.|$|E
5|$|The militia men {{involved}} in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend proved their ability to obey orders, act as a disciplined unit, and show bravery. Unlike at Stillman's Run, the troops waited for Colonel Henry Dodge's commands before acting {{on the field of}} battle. When ordered to charge, the men obeyed and eventually won a fight that <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> a bloody hand-to-hand battle. A memorial marker was erected to commemorate the battle in 1922. Today the battleground at Horseshoe Bend is a county park.|$|E
5|$|Valve {{considered}} {{adding a}} competitive mode to Portal 2. According to Wolpaw, the mode {{was similar to}} the video game Speedball; one team would try to transport a ball {{from one side of the}} playing field to the other using portals, while the other team would attempt to stop them with their own use of portals. Matches would commence with this objective in mind, but quickly <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> chaos. Valve realized that people enjoyed solving puzzles with portals more and therefore they focused on the cooperative mode.|$|E

5|$|William faced several {{challenges}} on becoming duke, including his illegitimate birth and his youth: the {{evidence indicates that}} he was either {{seven or eight years}} old at the time. He enjoyed the support of his great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as the king of France, Henry I, enabling him to succeed to his father's duchy. The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue his father's policies, but Archbishop Robert's death in March 1037 removed one of William's main supporters, and conditions in Normandy quickly <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> chaos.|$|E
5|$|After {{the militia}} {{advanced}} about 200yards (200m), the Kickapoo suddenly let loose a loud yell from their hidden {{position on the}} bank of an oxbow lake along the river. The warriors fired a volley toward the advancing militia and three men, Samuel Black, Samuel Wells and Montaville Morris, were hit and went down. Dodge did not hesitate and ordered his men to charge, they obeyed and waited until they were within six feet of the Kickapoo before discharging their weapons. The fight, after the initial charge and volley, <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> a hand-to-hand struggle with tomahawks, bayonets, muskets and spears the weapons of choice. The fighting only lasted a few minutes: nine Kickapoo were killed on the spot and the other two were felled while fleeing across the lake. During the hand-to-hand combat a fourth member of the militia, Thomas Jenkins, was wounded. Though short, the Battle of Horseshoe Bend had a lasting impact and influence {{on the rest of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|As McKinley's {{professional}} career progressed, so too did his social life blossom as he wooed Ida Saxton, {{the daughter of}} a prominent Canton family. They were married on January 25, 1871, in the newly built First Presbyterian Church of Canton, although Ida soon joined her husband's Methodist church. Their first child, Katherine, was born on Christmas Day 1871. A second daughter, Ida, followed in 1873, but died the same year. McKinley's wife <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> a deep depression at her baby's death and her health, never robust, grew worse. Two years later, in 1875, Katherine died of typhoid fever. Ida never recovered from her daughters' deaths; the McKinleys had no more children. Ida McKinley developed epilepsy around the same time and thereafter disliked her husband's leaving her side. He remained a devoted husband and tended to his wife's medical and emotional needs {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|By 681 {{the armies}} of the Umayyad Caliphate had {{expanded}} from their original homeland of Arabia to conquer North Africa, the Middle East and large parts of West Asia, bringing Islam in their wake and converting local peoples to the new religion. The Berbers of North Africa, called Moors by the Christians, thereby became Muslims. The Strait of Gibraltar became the frontier between Muslim North Africa and Christian Hispania and thus gained a new strategic significance. Hispania <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> {{civil war in the}} 8th century as rival Visigothic factions fought for control of the throne. This gave the Moors the opportunity to invade Hispania and pursue a course of dividing-and-conquering the Christian factions.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years into}} Superman's regime, the {{insurgency}} discovers a parallel universe where Joker's plan failed, and they teleport that world's Wonder Woman (Susan Eisenberg), Aquaman (Phil LaMarr), Green Arrow (Alan Tudyk), and Green Lantern (Adam Baldwin) into their universe. Batman and Joker are accidentally transported as well, but are separated after {{an encounter with}} the regime's military forces. While searching for somewhere to recharge his power ring, Green Lantern encounters Sinestro (Troy Baker) and his Yellow Lantern counterpart. Aquaman visits the archives of Atlantis, where he discovers how Superman <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> tyranny and that Atlantis has agreed to complete subjugation under Superman. He is then forced to fight his counterpart as well.|$|E
5|$|Hamdanid {{relations}} with Byzantium collapsed completely in 985–986, after the Fatimids took the Byzantine fortress of Balanyas. Sa'd al-Dawla refused to continue paying tribute. As a result, the Byzantines under Bardas Phokas invaded his territory and sacked Killis before retracing their steps and marching south to an unsuccessful siege of Apamea. In retaliation, Sa'd al-Dawla sent his troops to raze the famous monastery of Qal'at Sim'an. However, soon after that, in May 986, {{the prospect of}} an imminent conclusion of a peace between Byzantium and Egypt forced Sa'd al-Dawla to return to his earlier allegiance, and he re-affirmed his tributary status on the same terms as before. This did not prevent Sa'd al-Dawla from supporting the Byzantine general Bardas Skleros in his second rebellion against Basil II, once he was released from Buyid captivity in December 986, nor of recognizing Fatimid suzerainty in the same month, especially as Byzantium now <b>descended</b> <b>into</b> a civil war that lasted until 989.|$|E
