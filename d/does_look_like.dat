500|$|Kristina Wilson, {{associate}} professor in the Department of Visual and Performing Arts at Worcester's Clark University, asked people on campus what they thought of Turtle Boy. One person replied [...] "Oh, that's Worcester's monument to bestiality." [...] Wilson said the sculpture is intended to portray [...] "innocence, joy, and rebirth," [...] and that historically Charles Y. Harvey came from an artistic tradition in which [...] "the human figure is the apex of beauty, and how well you can capture that is the demonstration of your artistic talents." [...] Regarding the artistic merit of the work, Wilson said: [...] "It's unfortunate, because it really <b>does</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> something untoward is going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Parker and Stone were in New York {{to attend}} the 65th Tony Awards, when they were {{requested}} for interviews and had to answer questions at press junkets regarding the episode. On June 15, 2011, Parker and Stone appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, where they denied being unhappy with the show and stated that they still enjoy producing episodes. Parker commented that, while the episode did deal with some issues they had with the show, they particularly enjoyed creating [...] "You're Getting Old", and that despite not knowing what upcoming episodes would be about, they would figure it out upon resuming production in August 2011. [...] "Looking back at it, it kinda <b>does</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> we’re kinda saying we don't {{want to do this}} anymore, but it's not really what we were saying," [...] said Parker in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E
500|$|A review from Idolator {{said that}} the futuristic theme to the video {{might have been better}} suited to the {{previous}} international single, [...] "Commander." [...] It also said, [...] "The pop diva continues her ascent to grown woman in this sun-soaked video, making good use of palm trees, a convertible, and the Los Angeles skyline," [...] commenting that she takes [...] "a breezy approach so casual it almost <b>does</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a camera crew just happened to stumble upon a typical day out with the girls." [...] The reviewer concluded that [...] "it's hard to imagine better uses for a touch screen than getting {{as close as possible to}} the carefree fun on display here." [...] Steven Gottlieb of Video Static said, [...] " [...] a casual and sunny pop video gets a bit of a twist, or a flick, via an interface that's swiped from your iPhone...It's possibly not the kind of finger manipulation some Kelly Rowland fans have been dreaming about, but even they should admit it's a clever conceit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, they <b>did</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> lumbermen," [...] replied Mr. Stone. [...] "That is why I {{was not so}} {{particular}} about their identification." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can hardly}} explain. I {{can only say}} that he <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a hawk and she like a dove--and, now that I think of it, that is what they each <b>did</b> <b>look</b> like; and <b>do</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> in their normal condition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They sure <b>do</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> some goats now!" [...] cried Andy gaily. Then {{the animals}} were shoved back into the closet and the door closed.|$|R
500|$|Following the game, however, {{controversy}} emerged about a silhouetted {{camera shot}} of Prince, projected against a large sheet by {{a bright light}} {{on the other side}} of the performer. The controversy centered around his guitar, which detractors claimed seemed phallic, and critics stating that it [...] "looked embarrassingly rude, crude and unfortunately placed." [...] Though the guitar has been considered by some an extension of a male player's sexuality (especially highlighted by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and even Prince himself), supporters of Prince say that the show did not, in fact, become any more sexually charged than usual, noting that [...] "a guitar at waist level <b>does</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> an enormous phallus." [...] ABC late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! responded to this mild controversy by including two satirically pixelized Super Bowl clips on its weekly segment [...] "This Week in Unnecessary Censorship" [...] for the February 9, 2007 episode. The first [...] "censored" [...] clip was the kickoff show introduction for CBS' coverage of the Super Bowl, with the first two letters of [...] "kickoff" [...] blurred out as if [...] "jackoff" [...] were censored, then with a clip of the shadow of Prince playing guitar with the guitar neck blurred out as if an actual penis were being blurred.|$|E
2500|$|The MP Harry Cohen said, [...] "This <b>does</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> {{a serious}} {{conflict}} of interest. Sir John {{did a lot}} of work at the MoD on Al Yamamah and here we now have the NAO covering up this report." [...] In early 2002 he had proposed an Early Day Motion noting [...] "that there have been... allegations made of large commission payments made to individuals in Saudi Arabia as part of... Al Yamamah... that Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda network have received substantial funds from individuals in Saudi Arabia." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gun in Your Pocket {{was finally}} {{released}} in October 2012 as the B-side to Cool Zombie, the eventual first single from the album (which finally emerged in January 2013). [...] In {{addition to this}} song, Baillie and Adam Ant composed a second track about the Ross-Brand affair, Rubber Medusa, a song focussed mainly on Brand and written from Baillie's perspective. [...] Baillie's band, the Poussez Posse, performed this second song regularly in live support slots for Ant's UK tours during 2011–2012. [...] Commenting on the two songs in an interview by John Robb, Baillie noted [...] "The first one that Adam and I wrote was about an ex of mine- guess who! Which {{is not on the}} album, which is called Gun in Your Pocket ...(Subsequently) the first one Adam and I wrote together was Rubber Medusa, which was about Russell, Adam came up with the title which is a quote from the Jubilee film, (Brand) <b>does</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a rubber Medusa so I see why he said it." ...|$|E

2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper {{scored the}} PlayStation 3 version 7.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "certainly the best {{version of the}} bunch." [...] Of the controls, he wrote [...] "it doesn't feel as {{rewarding}} or [...] "realistic" [...] as EA would have liked. Really, it just feels like you're suggesting what should happen and then hoping it does." [...] He was also critical of the graphics; [...] "its visuals are simply poor for a next-generation title. Other than the high-definition output, it doesn't look like anything has been noticeably changed. Texture resolution is pretty bad, some of the effects are very last-gen and it really <b>does</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> you're playing a PS2 game in HD." [...] He concluded [...] "the game is a strong and rather noticeable improvement over the original release, though much of it does feel outdated on the PlayStation 3. EA {{has done a great}} job of expanding nearly every facet of the game, [...] with last-gen visuals, a frustrating city layout and other issues that plagued the original release, it's still far from perfect." [...] Game Informers Matt Helgeson also scored it 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "it still doesn't solve the problems I have with the game as a whole, which remain largely the same." [...] He concluded [...] "The Godfathers uninspired craftsmanship falls short of being a truly compelling game experience." ...|$|E
