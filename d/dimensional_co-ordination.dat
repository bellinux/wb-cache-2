50|$|Technically {{the most}} {{important}} feature of the temple architecture of Kerala is the construction technique using a dimensional standardisation. The nucleus of the temple plan is the shrine containing the garbhagrhiha cell. The width of this cell is the basic module of the dimensional system. In plan composition, {{the width of the}} shrine, the open space around it, the position and sizes of the surrounding structures, are all related to the standard module. In vertical composition, this <b>dimensional</b> <b>co-ordination</b> is carried right up to the minute construction details such as the size of the pillars, wall plates, rafters etc. The canonical rules of the proportionate system are given in the treatises and preserved by the skilled craftsmen. This proportionate system has ensured uniformity in architectural style irrespective of the geographical distribution and scale of construction.|$|E
40|$|The {{universal}} {{approaches to}} the approximated construction of the generalized (intermediate) quantum-mechanical effective operators for multielectronic systems have been developed. On their base the group of the new effective methods for non-empiric design of the electron structure of the molecules oriented to {{the description of the}} excitated electronic states in the wide value fields of the nuclear configuration parameters including at presence of the quasi-degenerations an pseuda-crossing of the electronic terms has been created. The general solution of the problems for obtaining convergent series of the quasi-degenarated theory of distortions and combination of the numerical instability and accurate <b>dimensional</b> <b>co-ordination</b> in the typical problems for desing of the low-laying electronic states of the molecules has been founds firstly. The principial-new approach to the construction of the stationary theory of dictortions for effective operators, foreseing the simultaneous use of several clusterings of the total Hamilton into the non-distorted part and distortion has been proposed.
