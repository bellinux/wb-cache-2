5|$|In 1913, {{the state}} highway system was {{adjusted}} again, and several new roads {{were added to}} the system, including parts of what would become US410. The Olympic Highway traveled around the Olympic Peninsula and a section from Aberdeen to Olympia was later used as part of US410. The Pacific Highway would later have a brief concurrency with US410 from Olympia to Tacoma, and US410 would later connect to the National Park Highway in Tacoma and follow it to Buckley, where State Road5, now a secondary highway maintained by the counties, began. From the end of State Road5 in Naches, the Inland Empire Highway is concurrent with the future US410 to Dayton, where a branch of the highway travels to Clarkston. State Road5 became the McClellan Pass Highway in 1919 and was aligned further south to Chinook Pass. The McClellan Pass Highway was renamed the Naches Pass Highway in 1921 to reflect the realignment in 1919. Despite the name, the road did not cross Naches Pass, as no highway <b>ever</b> <b>has.</b>|$|E
5|$|With 174yards, Da'Rel Scott set the Maryland {{record for}} rushing {{yards in a}} bowl game, despite playing just {{one and a half}} {{quarters}} due to his curfew suspension. The previous record was 165yards, set by Lu Gambino in Maryland's first bowl game, the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also broke the 1,000 yards-per-season barrier, making him one of just seven players in school history to do so. Scott said earlier in the year that reaching the 1,000-yard benchmark was a personal goal he set for the 2008 season. Between Scott and Davin Meggett, Maryland also came the closest it <b>ever</b> <b>has</b> to having both a 1,000- and 500-yard rusher in the same season. Meggett fell just 43yards shy of the 500-yard mark.|$|E

Some authors regard Wiselius as forceful, sharp-witted, animated or even overstrung. Simon Schama hardly <b>ever</b> <b>has</b> a positive opinion of Wiselius and the Patriot brotherhood, describing them as only quasi-intellectual, and Wiselius himself as a minor figure, a Jacobin, a renegade and an over-loud, pessimistic drawing-room liberal who shirked real issues, and ended up leaving politics an embittered man.|$|E

Gone are the glory days when all the major Formula One teams (including Scuderia Ferrari) came to Cheshire, now the major events on the circuit’s calendar are the twice-yearly visit of the British Superbike Championship and the annual visit of the British Touring Car Championship. This is no fault of the circuit management – it is just the way the sport has gone. But Oulton Park is still the great challenge it always was.|$|E
40|$|The {{status of}} {{mammography}} screening experience and {{factors related to}} utilization were examined in six towns serviced by physician staffs at five hospitals. Data were collected via random digit dial telephone interview of a probability sample of 1184 women, aged 45 - 75 years. The results showed that 55 % of the women reported <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> had a mammogram. Of those who <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> a mammogram, 21 % reported that the mammogram {{in the past year}} was their first one. Of those women who are over 50 and <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> a mammogram, 57 % reported one in the past year. Analyses demonstrated that a combination of demographic factors, certain beliefs and knowledge, having a regular physician, social interaction and media exposure are independently related to <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> a mammogram, and to having one in the past year. Despite anecdotal and empirical evidence that the proportion of women <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> had a mammogram has substantially increased in the past several years, increasing utilization among older and lower-income women provides a challenge for public health...|$|R

The legend moved to the bottom from changeover to fat dies in October 1992 and since the variations of dies and bases occurred from time to time.

500|$|Although earlier {{metrical}} homilies, such {{as those}} of Ælfric and Wulfstan, were based on the rules of Old English poetry, they took sufficient liberties with meter to be readable as prose. Orm does not follow their example. Rather, he adopts a [...] "jog-trot fifteener" [...] for his rhythm, based on the Latin iambic septenarius, and writes continuously, neither dividing his work into stanzas nor rhyming his lines, again following Latin poetry (Bennett 1986, p.31). The work is unusual in that no critic <b>ever</b> <b>has</b> stepped forward to defend it on literary grounds. Indeed, Orm was humble about his oeuvre: he admits in the preface that he frequently has padded the lines to fill out the meter, [...] "to help those who read it", and urges his brother Walter to edit the poetry to make it more meet (Treharne 2000, pp.274–75).|$|E
