25|$|All {{thermodynamic}} cycles require large temperature differentials for efficient operation. In {{an external}} combustion engine, the <b>heater</b> <b>temperature</b> always equals or exceeds the expansion temperature. This {{means that the}} metallurgical requirements for the heater material are very demanding. This {{is similar to a}} Gas turbine, but is in contrast to an Otto engine or Diesel engine, where the expansion temperature can far exceed the metallurgical limit of the engine materials, because the input heat source is not conducted through the engine, so engine materials operate closer to the average temperature of the working gas. The Stirling cycle is not actually achievable, the real cycle in Stirling machines is less efficient than the theoretical Stirling cycle, also the efficiency of the Stirling cycle is lower where the ambient temperatures are mild, while it would give its best results in a cool environment, such as northern countries' winters.|$|E

40|$|Icing {{and drag}} {{investigations}} {{were conducted in}} the NACA Lewis icing research tunnel employing a combination thermal-pneumatic de-icer mounted on a 42 -inch-chord NACA 0018 airfoil. The de-icer consisted of a 3 -inch-wide electrically heated strip symmetrically located about the leading edge with inflatable tubes on {{the upper and lower}} airfoil surfaces aft of the heated area. The entire de-icer extended to approximately 25 percent of chord. A maximum power density of 9. 25 watts per square inch was required for marginal ice protection on the airfoil leading edge at an air temperature of 00 F and an airspeed of 300 miles per hour. Drag measurements indicated, that without icing, the de-icer installation increased the section drag to approximately 140 percent of that of the bare airfoil; with the tubes inflated, this value increased to a maximum of approximately 620 percent. A 2 -minute tube-inflation cycle prevented excessive ice formation on the inflatable area although small scattered residual Ice formations remained after inflation and were removed intermittently during later cycles.

The heater coil and the action of the bi-metallic strip introduce a time delay that affords the motor time to start and settle into normal running current without the thermal overload tripping. Thermal overloads can be manually or automatically resettable depending on their application and have an adjuster that allows them to be accurately set to the motor run current.|$|E
