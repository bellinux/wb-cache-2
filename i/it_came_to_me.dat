[...] In 1906, Roger Fry {{gave it a}} well-documented restoration with overpaint removed. Fry {{was at the time}} Curator of Paintings at the Metropolitan Museum and performed restorations despite a formal lack of training; the St Francis was the second restoration he undertook. He attributed the work to Hubert van Eyck, and thought the Turin version a copy. His removal of a section at the top revealed a red border; he wrote that van Eyck had [...] "conceived it as a miniature in oil on panel, and that it might indicate a date not very far removed from the drawings of the Turin Book of Hours" [...] (Milan-Turin Hours). In 1926 he recorded: [...] "When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the panel was considerably larger at the top, and dull opaque sky concealed the join where the extra piece had been added on to satisfy some owner who did not appreciate the compressed composition [...] of the original. The sky had been enlivened... with a crowd of small white-cloud like forms suggesting the presence of a cohort of angels." [...] His restoration removed more than 10 centimetres; before the restoration it measured , afterwards [...]|$|E

6000|$|Densher {{faced her}} words {{as if they}} had been an {{accusation}}, an accusation for which he was prepared and which there was but one way to face. [...] "I have indeed my instinct. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> while I worried it out, last night. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as an effect of the hour." [...] He held up his letter and seemed now to insist more than to confess. [...] "This thing had been timed." ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{delighted to}} have your letter. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like a {{faithful}} voice from dear old Rockingham, and awakens many memories.|$|R
6000|$|And almost next <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> <b>comes</b> (<b>to</b> <b>me,</b> always I mean {{in my own}} fancy) Virgilia, [...] "Yes, certain; there's {{a letter}} for you; I saw it."[4] ...|$|R

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I {{was upon}} this dark common, helpless, unprotected, and alone. Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from without, came--fear.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! I would {{guarantee}} expenses, and you won't let me! The money is my personal possession: <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> from my late grandfather, {{and not from}} my father at all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't <b>it</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> dear, sweet pet? Do come; I'll be as kind to {{you almost}} as your poor mother." [...] The monkey {{looked at the}} child, but said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|MRS HUSHABYE. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{suddenly}} {{that you are}} a real person: that you had a mother, like anyone else. [Putting her hands on his shoulders and surveying him]. Little Alf! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ye speak me true, my leetle son, [...] So--so, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> [...] A-drifting landwards on a spar, [...] And grey dawn on the sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tess," [...] he insisted; [...] "don't speak so! <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like a jolly new idea! And {{you don't}} believe me? What don't you believe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I dreaded to {{hear her}} answer, given to ears already awake to suspicion; but <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as a new pain or shock all the same: ...|$|E

60|$|The {{scene was}} {{fascinating}} in its terribleness, but suddenly <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that we were}} wasting valuable time watching this conflict, which in itself might prove a means of our escape.|$|E
6000|$|... "I scarce {{knew what}} I did, but as I lay beside her <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I {{did not wish}} to rise again--that already I had lived overlong. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that, seeing me fallen, haply those cowards would seize the chance to make an end of me as I lay.

6000|$|... "Quite true, and yet I {{could not}} have been your heir, nor you mine. The estate would escheat to the king, Hanoverian or Scotchman, before <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Indeed, to me it could never come." ...|$|E

50|$|I heard {{stuff that}} {{supposedly}} I'm a head case, he said. I'm supposedly a diva. Like, I think my shit don't stink and all this.

6000|$|... "Listen, my child," [...] said he, gently; [...] "all {{the toys}} I am now making are promised to others. But the next shall be yours, since your heart so longs for <b>it.</b> <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again {{in two days}} and it shall be ready for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{what it was}} {{the gentleman}} had been saying to me: [...] "I say, sir, you with the bit of wood in your mouth, you have been {{and shut the door}} and I can't get in." ...|$|E
6000|$|Some beast had frightened them. What was it? I did {{not know}} whether a bear would eat deer flesh, but I thought not. Perhaps timber-wolves had {{disturbed}} the coyotes. But would they run from wolves? <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> suddenly--a mountain-lion! ...|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that for}} some days, three or four, I sat in my cell at the palace, for here I was kept because, as I learned afterwards, it was feared that if I were removed to that State prison of which I had been governor, some attempt would be made <b>to</b> rescue <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|It wasn't {{my place}} to fetch her {{one on the}} side of the head, but I'd of liked to have; for she was acting like she'd never used to act when I knew her--all tough and bold.

6000|$|... "Refreshed, I hope, by your {{bath and}} change, my dear visitor?" [...] {{the head of}} the house remarked, as he laid down his paper.
