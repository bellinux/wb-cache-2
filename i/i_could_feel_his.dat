500|$|Although it {{was decided}} he has a sister, {{a wife and a}} daughter, Meyer's {{personal}} life is rarely mentioned on screen, enabling viewers to perceive him as a strong man onto whom they can [...] "project whatever they want from their own imagination." [...] Irving believes that modern television drama is populated by characters prone to disclosing everything about themselves, and so feels that having an enigmatic character like Meyer, who behaves in the reserved vein of Humphrey Bogart and Spencer Tracy, makes for a [...] "refreshing change". He commented that revealing more of Meyer's personal life would be anticlimatic compared to viewers' expectations. As preparation for the role, Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital, deeming the experience an [...] "enormous privilege". He had a [...] "real fascination" [...] with medicine and the human body prior to assuming the role, and considered studying biology at university. Upon receiving the script for the first episode of Holby City, Irving felt immediately connected to Meyer, commenting: [...] "I knew instinctively how he moved, how he spoke, what he felt. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> heartbeat." ...|$|E
60|$|Very cheerful! He was {{a horrible}} nuisance. And all at once he started to argue. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> crazy {{excitement}} in the dark.|$|E
60|$|Steele {{stood at}} our backs, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> presence. He thrilled me. He {{had some kind}} of effect on the others, {{especially}} the dealer, who was honest enough while the Ranger looked on.|$|E
60|$|Then I rose, {{and going}} to the open window, drew up the blind and stood there staring at the sky, which grew pearl-hued with the first faint tinge of dawn. Leo came also and leant upon the window-sill, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>his</b> body was {{trembling}} as though with cold. Clearly he was much moved.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A very {{uncommon}} headache,' thought Louis. 'My belief is, that it {{is little}} short of brain fever! If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> pulse! But {{it would be very}} like taking a mad dog's hand. There's nothing for it but to fetch old Walby. He may have some experience of refractory patients.' ...|$|R
60|$|The leper halted in {{the front}} porch {{for a moment and}} we jumped out on him with the sticks. He was wonderfully strong, and we were afraid that he might escape or be fatally injured before we caught him. We had an idea that lepers were frail creatures, but this proved to be incorrect. Strickland knocked his legs from under him and I put my foot on his neck. He mewed hideously, and even through my riding-boots <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>his</b> flesh was not the flesh of a clean man.|$|R
60|$|Tars Tarkas {{listened in}} silence, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> eyes riveted upon me and I {{knew that he}} awaited my answer as one might listen to the reading of his {{sentence}} by the foreman of a jury.|$|E
60|$|He had dodged behind me, and {{appeared}} to be looking anxiously down the road. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> aged frame shaking with terror as he laid his thin hands upon my shoulders and faced me {{in the direction of the}} supposed danger.|$|E
6000|$|Once (once only) I went absent-mindedly {{into his}} shop {{in a pair}} of boots bought in an {{emergency}} at some large firm's. He took my order without showing me any leather, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> eyes penetrating the inferior integument of my foot. At last he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But if I {{needed a}} canine {{companion}} I had one, for by {{day or night}} this invisible dog never left me. When I slept {{he lay on the}} floor by the side of my bed; if I put down my hand <b>I</b> <b>could</b> always <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> head, and often he would stand up and press his nose against me, as if to assure me that he was there. This strange companionship continued for several days, and I became really attached to the invisible animal. His constant companionship seemed to indicate that he had come to guard me, and that he was determined to do it thoroughly. I felt so much confidence in his protection, although I knew not how it could be exerted, that one morning I decided to take a walk, and with my hand on the head of the dog, {{to make sure that he}} was with me, I strolled into the open country.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it {{was upon}} {{the first of}} October that the treaty was finally to be signed. In the morning I was congratulating Monsieur Otto upon the happy {{conclusion}} of his labours. He was a little pale shrimp of a man, very quick and nervous, {{and he was so}} delighted now at his own success that he could not sit still, but ran about the room chattering and laughing, while I sat on a cushion in the corner, as I had learned to do in the East. Suddenly, in came a messenger with a letter which had been forwarded from Paris. Monsieur Otto cast his eye upon it, and then, without a word, his knees gave way, and he fell senseless upon the floor. I ran to him, as did the courier, and between us we carried him to the sofa. He might have been dead from his appearance, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> still <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> heart thrilling beneath my palm. 'What is this, then?' I asked.|$|R
60|$|At last {{we reached}} the curtains, and here Billali {{collapsed}} flat on to his stomach, with his hands stretched out before him {{as though he were}} dead, and I, not knowing what to do, began to stare about the place. But presently I clearly felt that somebody was looking at me from behind the curtains. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not see the person, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> distinctly <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> or her gaze, and, what is more, it produced a very odd effect upon my nerves. I was frightened, I do not know why. The place was a strange one, it is true, and looked lonely, notwithstanding its rich hangings and the soft glow of the lamps--indeed, these accessories added to, rather than detracted from its loneliness, just as a lighted street at night has always a more solitary appearance than a dark one. It was so silent in the place, and there lay Billali like one dead before the heavy curtains, through which the odour of perfume seemed to float up towards the gloom of the arched roof above. Minute grew into minute, and still {{there was no sign of}} life, nor did the curtain move; but I felt the gaze of the unknown being sinking through and through me, and filling me with a nameless terror, till the perspiration stood in beads upon my brow.|$|R
60|$|He {{called the}} {{messenger}} in, after some little stay, {{and asked him}} where the person was who gave him the letter. The messenger told him the place, which was about seven miles off, so he bid him stay, and ordering a horse to be got ready, and two servants, away {{he came to me}} with the messenger. Let any one judge the consternation I was in when my messenger came back, and told me the old gentleman was not at home, but his son was come along with him, and was just coming up to me. I was perfectly confounded, for I knew not whether it was peace or war, nor could I tell how to behave; however, I had but a very few moments to think, for my son was at the heels of the messenger, and coming up into my lodgings, asked the fellow at the door something. I suppose it was, for I did not hear it so as to understand it, which was the gentlewoman that sent him; for the messenger said, 'There she is, sir'; at which he comes directly up to me, kisses me, took me in his arms, and embraced me with so much passion that he could not speak, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> breast heave and throb like a child, that cries, but sobs, and cannot cry it out.|$|E
60|$|The captain looked sheepish {{enough at}} this, {{but he looked}} sorrowful, too, {{as if he could}} have wished it had been different, and he asked the man if he had been abused since he came on board. Well, the man said, not unless you called tainted salt-horse and weevilly biscuit abuse; and then the captain sat down again, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> poor wife {{shrinking}} beside me. The man said that he was comparatively well off on the captain's ship, and the life was not half such a dog's life as he had led on other vessels; but it was such that when he got ashore here in Altruria, and saw how white people lived, people that used each other white, he made up his mind that he would never go hack to any ship alive. He hated a ship so much that if he could go home to America as a first-class passenger on a Cunard liner, John D. Rockefeller would not have money enough to hire him to do it. He was going to stay in Altruria till he died, if they would let him, and he guessed they would, if what he had heard about them was true. He just wanted, he said, while we were about it, to have a few of his mates tell their experience, not so much on board the Little Sally, but on shore, and since they could remember; and one after another did get up and tell their miserable stories. They were like the stories you sometimes read in your paper over your coffee, or that you can hear any time you go into the congested districts in New York; but I assure you, my dear, they seemed to me perfectly incredible here, though I had known hundreds of such stories at home. As I realized their facts I forgot where I was; I felt that I was back again in that horror, where it sometimes seemed to me I had no right to be fed or clothed or warm or clean {{in the midst of the}} hunger and cold and nakedness and dirt, and where I could only reconcile myself to my comfort because I knew my discomfort would not help others' misery.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I am {{coming to}} the Indians,' Hubert said; 'but {{it was a new}} duck, for all that; and if you like it, I will show it you. There!' And he took it {{out of his pocket and}} laid it on the table. No one {{appeared}} to have the slightest interest in it, or to pay any attention to it. So Hubert went on: 'Well, after looking at the duck, I put it into my pocket, and went out from the bushes to my horse. As I got to him, I heard a yell, which nearly made me tumble down, it startled me so; and not a hundred yards away, and riding to cut me off from home, were thirty or forty Indians. I was not long, as you may guess, climbing into my saddle, and bolted like a shot. I could not make straight for home, but had to make a sweep to get round them. I was better mounted than all of them, except three; but they kept gradually gaining on me, while all the rest in turn gave up the chase: and, like papa, I had left my revolver behind. Black Tom did his best, and I encouraged him to the utmost; but I began to think that it was all up with me, for I was convinced that they would catch me before I could get in. When I was little more than three hundred yards from the gate, I saw Maud come dashing down with her rifle towards the gate, and a little afterwards Ethel came too. The Indians kept getting nearer and nearer, and I expected every moment to feel the tomahawk. I could not think why the girls did not fire, but I supposed that they did not feel sure enough of their aim; and I had the consolation that the Indian nearest could not be going to strike, or they would risk a shot. On I went: the Indian was so close that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> horse's breath, and the idea came across my mind that the brute was trying to catch hold of the calf of my leg. At a hundred yards I could see Maud's face quite plain, and then I felt certain I was saved. She looked as steady as if she had been taking aim at a mark, and the thought flashed across me of how last week she had hit a small stone on a post, at eighty yards, first shot, when Charley and I had missed it half a dozen times each. Then there was a frightful yell, almost in my ear. Then I heard Maud cry out, [...] "Stoop, Hubert, stoop!" [...] I was stooping before, but my head went down to the horse's mane, I can tell you. And then there was the crack of the two rifles, and a yell of pain. I could not look round, but I felt that the horse behind me had stopped, and that I was safe. That's my story, papa.' ...|$|E
60|$|After {{we went to}} live in Cambridge, my {{life and}} the delight in it were so wholly there that in ten years I had hardly been in as many Boston houses. As I have said, I met Doctor Holmes at the Fieldses', and at Longfellow's, {{when he came out}} to a Dante supper, which was not often, and {{somewhat}} later at the Saturday Club dinners. One parlous time at the publisher's I have already recalled, when Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe and the Autocrat clashed upon homeopathy, and it required all the tact of the host to lure them away from the dangerous theme. As it was, a battle waged in the courteous forms of Fontenoy, went on pretty well through the dinner, and it was only over the coffee that a truce was called. I need not say which was heterodox, or that each had a deep and strenuous conscience in the matter. I have always felt it a proof of his extreme leniency to me, unworthy, that the doctor was able to tolerate my own defection from the elder faith in medicine; and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> kindness less caressing because I knew it a concession to an infirmity. He said something like, After all a good physician was the great matter; and I eagerly turned his clemency to praise of our family doctor.|$|R
60|$|It was Elliot's jackanapes, very meagre, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel,</b> and all <b>his</b> ribs {{standing}} out, but he {{made much}} of me, fondling me after his manner; and indeed, for my lady's sake, I kissed him, wondering much how he came there. Then he put something into my hands, {{almost as if he}} had been a Christian, for it was a wise beast and a kind. Even then there shone into my memory the thought of how my lady had prayed for her little friend when he was stolen (which I had thought strange, and scarcely warranted by our Faith), and with that, hope wakened within me. My eyes being now more accustomed to the darkness, I saw that the thing which the jackanapes gave me was a little wallet, for he had been taught to fetch and carry, and never was such a marvel at climbing. But as I was caressing him, I found a string about his neck, to which there seemed to be no end. Now, at length, I comprehended what was toward, and pulling gently at the string, I found, after some time, that it was attached to something heavy, on the outside of the casement. Therefore I set about drawing in string from above, and more string, and more, and then appeared a knot and a splice, and the end of a thick rope. So I drew and drew, till it stopped, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see a stout bar across the stanchions of the casement. Thereon I ceased drawing, and opening the little wallet, I found two files, one very fine, the other of sturdier fashion.|$|R
60|$|We knelt close {{together}} at her feet. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> Mary's heart throbbing, as she pressed nearer and nearer to my side. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> {{my own heart}} quickening its beat, with a fear that was a mystery to me.|$|R
5000|$|I didn't {{know what}} to say, but I knew there was trouble coming. As Elvis held my arm, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> hand shaking. It made me feel as though mine was shaking, too. And {{that was the last}} time I saw him." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the above, two others have reported NDEs and have some relationship to the religion. In Atwater's more recent book Near-Death Experiences, the Rest of the Story: What They Teach Us about Living and Dying and Our True Purpose on p. 257 Atwater records an anecdote of another reference to the religion:"It is my opinion," [...] said Teri, [...] "that Michael has been living with the aftereffects since childhood. One afternoon he called me and asked if I {{wanted to go to}} church with him. I said no, but I would love to take him to Bahá'í Temple in Wilmette. After climbing the stairs to the Temple together we walked in a circle, reading inscriptions over the doors. Over one set of doors, facing East, we paused to read, [...] "Ye are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch.' I looked up at Michael as tears welled in his eyes. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> pain and frustration. It was the kind of frustration that comes with the knowledge of having crossed over, of having been 'there', of having returned from the threshold of death carrying his message for mankind with a remote memory of 'the other side'." ...|$|E
60|$|The little flame died out. She <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> body trembling.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> {{my senses}} leaving me. In the room {{across the hall}} {{there was a man}} singing. His voice, that had been loud, came fainter and fainter through the transom. I fell into a sleep, the deep immeasurable sleep in which the very {{existence}} of the outer world was hushed. Dimly <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the days go past, then the years, and then the long passage of the centuries.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> Alicia looking me over {{critically}} {{the moment}} we met. I trembled with suspense, but I was soon relieved.|$|R
60|$|Yet <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that Paolo, sitting silent, like a {{monolith}} also, in {{the chimney}} opening, he understood: Maria also understood.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} for a moment, but I knew already what Fowler was going to say. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> it coming.|$|R
