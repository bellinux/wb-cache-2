5|$|Nasser also {{attempted}} to maintain {{oversight of the}} country's civil service {{to prevent it from}} inflating and consequently becoming a burden to the state. New laws provided workers with a minimum wage, profit shares, free education, free health care, reduced working hours, and encouragement to participate in management. Land reforms guaranteed the security of tenant farmers, promoted agricultural growth, and reduced rural poverty. As a result of the 1962 measures, <b>government</b> <b>ownership</b> of Egyptian business reached 51percent, and the National Union was renamed the Arab Socialist Union (ASU). With these measures came more domestic repression, as thousands of Islamists were imprisoned, including dozens of military officers. Nasser's tilt toward a Soviet-style system led his aides Boghdadi and Hussein el-Shafei to submit their resignations in protest.|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{developing}} economies, government as an important stakeholder plays a proactive role in strategic investment decisions made by firms. In this paper we investigate whether the equity stake held by government in the acquiring and the target firm influence likelihood of deal completion. Our analysis of over 500 cross-border deals by Brazilian multinational firms suggests that <b>government</b> equity <b>ownership</b> has a material impact on deal completion. While government equity stake in the acquirer enhances likelihood of deal completion, <b>government</b> equity <b>ownership</b> in the target firm diminishes the possibility. Moreover, the effects of <b>government</b> equity <b>ownership</b> differ for public traded and private traded firms...|$|R

5|$|Of equal profile was Rutherford's government's {{management}} of the province's railways. Alberta's early years were optimistic ones, which manifested itself in a pronounced enthusiasm {{for the construction of}} new railway lines. Every town wanted to be a railway centre, and the government had great confidence in the ability of the free market to provide low freight rates to the province's farmers provided sufficient charters were issued to competing companies. The legislature passed government-sponsored legislation setting out a framework for new railways in 1907, but interest from private firms in actually building the lines was limited. In the face of public demand and support by legislators of all parties for as rapid as possible an expansion of the province's lines, the government offered loan guarantees to several companies in exchange for commitments to build lines. Rutherford justified this in part by his conviction that railways needed to expand along with population, rather than having railway expansion follow population growth as would be the case without government intervention. The Conservatives argued that this strategy didn't go far enough, and called for direct <b>government</b> <b>ownership.</b>|$|E
