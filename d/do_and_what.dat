Even though individuals in the United States are legally capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by barriers to entry such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in what they can <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they can achieve in accessing technology.

25|$|Feaver {{argued that}} his theory was {{different}} from other theories or models {{in that it was}} purely deductive, based on democratic theory rather than on anecdotal evidence, and better enabled analysis of day-to-day decisions and actions {{on the part of the}} civilian and military leadership It operated at the intersection of Huntington's institutional approach and Janowitz's sociological point of view. Huntington concentrated on the relationship between civilian leadership and the military qua institution while Janowitz focused on the relationship of the military qua individuals to American society. Agency theory provided a link between the two enabling an explanation of how civil-military relations work on a day-to-day basis. Specifically, agency theory would predict that the result of a regime of intrusive monitoring by the civilian leadership combined with shirking on the part of the military would result in the highest levels of civil-military conflict. Feaver suggested that post-Cold War developments had so profoundly reduced the perceived costs of monitoring and reduced the perceived expectation of punishment that the gap between what civilians ask the military to <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> the military would prefer to do had increased to unprecedented levels.|$|E

500|$|Donen made {{a host of}} {{critically}} acclaimed and popular films. His most important contribution {{to the art of}} film was helping to transition movie musicals from the realistic backstage settings of filmed theater to a more cinematic form that integrates film with dance. Eventually film scholars named this concept [...] "cine-dance" [...] (a dance that can only be created in the medium of film), and its origins are in the Donen/Kelly films. [...] Film scholar Casey Charness described [...] "cine-dance" [...] as [...] "a melding of the distinctive strengths of dancing and filmmaking that had never been done before" [...] and adds that Donen and Kelly [...] "seem to have elevated Hollywood dance from simplistic display of either dancing or photographic ability into a perception that incorporates both what the dancer can <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> the camera can see... developed a balance between camera and dancer that... encouraged both photographer and choreographer to contribute significantly to the creation and final effectiveness of dance." ...|$|E

500|$|Another quandary {{is that if}} the precogs' visions are infallible {{then the}} future cannot be otherwise, while if they are {{incorrect}} people will be punished for crimes they will never commit. Kowalski contends that the precogs only attain knowledge of what he calls the [...] "conditional future". He cites as evidence two examples: the scene where Agatha steers Anderton through the mall by foreseeing dangerous events and helping him circumnavigate them, and a later scene where she tells Anderton and his ex-wife what would have happened to their child if he had lived. In the first example, Agatha knows what Anderton will freely choose to do when presented with specific facts so she provides them to him, and, in the second, she knows what will have happened to the Anderton's son based on specific scenarios throughout his life, in which she can see what he would have freely chosen to <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> selections various people in his life would have freely made. According to Kowalski, the PreCrime unit therefore removes individuals from precise situations where they would freely choose to become a murderer.|$|E

Her debut single [...] "Hell No!" [...] was released in June 2005, ahead of the related self-titled debut album, Ricki-Lee. The song peaked at numberfive on the ARIA Singles Chart – remaining in the top-ten for three consecutive weeks. It was eventually certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association, for shipments of 35,000 copies. [...] "Sunshine" [...] was released as her second single in September, which peaked at numbereight and was also certified gold. Ricki-Lee was released on 3 October 2005, which peaked at number 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Coulter collaborated with a several producers and songwriters on the album, including Audius Mtawarira, Israel Cruz, Nitty, Jarrad Rogers and Kara DioGuardi, among others. [...] "Breathe" [...] was released as the album's third and final single in January 2006, and reached number14. At the 2006 Australian and New Zealand Urban Music Awards, Ricki-Lee was nominated for 'Best R Album'.|$|E
500|$|Geoffrey Marshall has characterised section 3 as a [...] "deeply mysterious provision" [...] {{in several}} respects, {{including}} judging how strong a provision it is [...] an issue since {{dealt with by}} the courts [...] but has also noted a disparity between what the Act {{might be expected to}} <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> it does. He argues that a litigant would hope that courts would strive to uphold his rights under the Convention, accepting a derivation from them only rarely; instead section 3 requires courts to find compatibility with the Convention where possible [...] in other words, to strive to find that the Convention does not impact the claimant. Alison L. Young has examined the upper boundaries to courts' powers of interpretation. She puts forward three possible limits: firstly, where the text of a statute is not ambiguous; secondly, where reading in words is inappropriate; and, thirdly, where any interpretation is restricted to cases where it does not involve implied repeal. Young dismisses the first two as incompatible with the legislative history (and, in at least the first case, judicial history) and believes the third to present no rigid limit on courts' powers at all. The decision of Pepper v Hart provides a method for the legislative history of a bill {{to play a role in}} its interpretation.|$|E

500|$|As Hannah Arendt pointed out, however, (following the {{utilitarian}} John Stuart Mill on this point): a bad conscience {{does not}} necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad conscience and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self. Representing our soul or true self by analogy as our house, Arendt wrote that [...] "conscience is the anticipation of the fellow who awaits you if and when you come home." [...] Arendt believed {{that people who are}} unfamiliar with the process of silent critical reflection about what they say and do will not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can [...] "count on its being forgotten the next moment;" [...] bad people are not full of regrets. Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word consciousness from conscience. One reason, she held, was that conscience, as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like consciousness: [...] "and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> to repent; before it became the lumen naturale or Kant's practical reason, it was the voice of God." ...|$|E
500|$|Sawyer and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) {{were the}} least-liked {{characters}} by viewers {{during the first}} few episodes, because, according to Lindelof, [...] "they were just really obnoxious, bad guys". In later episodes, however, Sawyer and Jin changed to be more likable. Towards the beginning of [...] "Confidence Man", Sawyer is seen reading the novel Watership Down by Richard Adams (this is the book that caused Boone to think that Sawyer took Shannon's inhaler). The novel has numerous similarities to Lost, including [...] "letting go", and building a society. Furthermore, the protagonists of Watership Down are rabbits – a recurring motif in Lost. The episode ends with a montage of various characters performing different activities, featuring the song [...] "I Shall Not Walk Alone", written by Ben Harper and performed by The Blind Boys of Alabama. One lyric from the song is, [...] "I just reach for mother Mary"; Sawyer's mother's name is Mary, and, according to reviewer Therese Odell from the Houston Chronicle, the lyric may be alluding to this. Also, percussionist Ryan McKinnie of The Blind Boys of Alabama said of many members of the group's blindness, [...] "Our disability doesn’t have to be a handicap. It's not about what you can't do. It's about what you <b>do.</b> <b>And</b> <b>what</b> we do is sing good gospel music." [...] This quotation is very similar to the oft-repeated quotation by many characters (especially Locke), [...] "Don't tell me what I can't do." ...|$|E
500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work.

500|$|Ritchson {{described}} Arthur Curry {{as someone}} who will [...] "do anything to save what he loves". The actor {{goes on to say}} that Arthur is [...] "passionate about nature, about the earth, and about the seas", and is not afraid to use his abilities to save those things that are dear to him. When comparing his character to Clark, Ritchson stated that Arthur is more confident in his abilities, and already knows what he can <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> his path is in life. Another big difference the actor pointed out is that unlike Clark, Arthur is willing to sacrifice people and things if it means preserving the greater good. When he first appears, one of Victor Stone's key characteristics is that both he and Clark can relate to the fact that they feel their abilities inhibit them from having a true relationship with the women they love. The writers tried to create parallels between the characters to emphasize this more, like Victor's fear of telling his girlfriend the truth about what LuthorCorp did to his body, and Clark's fear of Lana Lang discovering he is an alien. Writer Tracy Bellomo characterized Oliver as a guy that does not take himself very seriously, and enjoys making fun of people that try to take him that way. Bellomo believed that this is one of the reasons that Oliver is attracted to Lois, with the other being that Lois provides a challenge for him. Oliver's relationship with Clark is designed to [...] "broaden Clark's rather limited horizons", and to teach Clark that a world exists beyond Smallville.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{previously}} {{announcing his}} international retirement following the 2014 World Cup, Pirlo reversed his decision, and under new Italy manager, and Pirlo's former Juventus manager Antonio Conte, Pirlo {{returned to the}} Italian squad. On 10 October, Pirlo started in Italy's second Euro 2016 qualifying match, which ended in a 2–1 home win over Azerbaijan, overtaking Zoff with his 113th appearance for Italy. Pirlo assisted Chiellini's first goal of the match from a corner kick. In August 2015, Pirlo was called for Italy's Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Malta and Bulgaria in September; he appeared in Italy's 1–0 home victory over Malta on 3 September, becoming the first MLS player to represent Italy; this was his final international appearance. In total, Pirlo made four appearances under Conte, as Italy qualified for Euro 2016 on 10 October in a 3–1 win over Azerbaijan. On 23 May 2016, Pirlo, along with fellow MLS compatriot Giovinco, was left off of Conte's 30-player shortlist for Italy's Euro 2016 squad. Regarding their omission, Conte commented in a press conference: [...] "When you make a certain choice and go to play in certain leagues, you do so taking it into account that they could pay the consequences from a footballing viewpoint". In response to Conte's comments, Pirlo stated to Sky Italia: [...] "I have spoken to Conte {{and there is no}} disappointment on my part, he knows what he has to <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he should not do. We had discussions during the season and both parties made their own decisions. He is the coach and it's only right he makes his decisions and decides what is best for him. I hope Italy win although the favourites are other teams such as Germany, Spain and France." ...|$|E
