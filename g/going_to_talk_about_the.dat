2500|$|At Wimbledon, Mauresmo lost in {{the third}} round to two-time former {{champion}} Serena Williams, 6–7(5), 1–6. Hampered by a thigh injury, Mauresmo trailed 5–0 in the second set before breaking Williams's serve, only to be broken herself in the next game and lose the match. Mauresmo said after the match, [...] "I was not 100% in my movement but overall I thought there were some good moments in the first set. But I really started to feel the injury in the tiebreak, and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> second set." ...|$|E

It was your--I mean our--troubles Jake plunged into, and pluck that can't be daunted is better than genius. But you're an English Borderer and {{therefore}} half a Scot; you hate to let people guess your feelings." ...|$|E
60|$|As I am {{not going}} to talk to you, then, about the {{philosophy}} of the beautiful, or the history of art, you will ask me what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> <b>The</b> subject of my lecture to-night is what makes an artist and what does the artist make; what are the relations of the artist to his surroundings, what is the education the artist should get, and what is the quality of a good work of art.|$|E

We've lost seven years o' life, but that's no reason why we should waste the rest of it. Now hold on; don't {{interrupt}} me just yet. I come back thinking just as much of you as ever. I ain't going {{to say a word}} more about Ed; let the past stay past. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future." ...|$|E

6000|$|George's grin was {{expressive}} of good-natured toleration. [...] "Oh!" [...] he replied, [...] "I guess that's plain {{enough for}} me. You're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> boss's friends. Still, one man's {{as good as}} another in this country, and, if I wasn't way better than Martial, I'd drown myself. That's the kind of pernicious insect a decent man has no use for. What's he come on board for with three bags ram full of clothes, when many a better man humps his outfit {{up and down the}} Bush in an old blanket same as you have done? It's a sure thing that no man with a conscience wants to get into the land agency business. It's an institution for selling greensuckers ranching land that's rock and gravel and virgin forest. Besides, I heard the blame insect telling Miss Hamilton that nobody not raised in the hog-pen could drink my coffee." ...|$|E

I have been through it in Vienna, I have been through it in Rome. I have sat at long tables with politicians, have drawn little {{pictures}} upon the blotting-paper and been bored to death. In wearisome fashion we have drafted agreements, we have quarrelled and bickered, we have yawned and made of ourselves men of parchment. But to-night," [...] he added, taking another huge bite from his sandwich, [...] "to-night nothing of that sort is intended. Draconmeyer and I have an idea. Mr. Grex is favourably inclined towards it. That idea isn't a bit of good to ourselves or any one else unless Monsieur Douaille here shares our point of view. Here we are, then, all met together--let us hope for a week or two's enjoyment. Little by little we must try and {{see what we can do}} towards instilling that idea into the mind of Monsieur Douaille. We may succeed, we may fail, but let us always remember that our conversations are the conversations of four friends, met together upon what is nothing more or less than a holiday. I hate the sight of those sheets of blotting-paper and clean pens. Who wants to make notes, especially of what we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about!</b> <b>The</b> man who cannot carry notes in his head is no statesman." ...|$|E

She returns to the Tineretului and finds Găbița sitting at its restaurant.

5000|$|... "In 1988...I {{happened}} {{to run into}} Allen Ginsberg at St. Mark's Bookshop in New York {{and asked him if}} he would perform with me. We were in the poetry section, and he grabbed a book from the shelf and pointed out Wichita Vortex Sutra. The poem, written in 1966 and reflecting the anti-war mood of the times, seemed highly appropriate for the occasion. I composed a piano piece to accompany Allen's reading, which took place at the Schubert Theater on Broadway.:"Allen and I so thoroughly enjoyed the collaboration that we soon began talking about expanding our performance into an evening-length music-theater work. It was right after the 1988 presidential election, and neither Bush nor Dukakis seemed to talk about anything that was going on. I remember saying to Allen, if these guys aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> issues then we should." ...|$|E

[...] "I had already done the customary pre-interview over the phone from L.A.... I had told her I would be happy to discuss anything except the custody case because a gag order had been placed on those concerned. If I were to discuss the subject in any way, I would be in contempt of court." [...] Nevertheless, GMA was insistent on taking advantage of the opportunity to discuss the split. [...] "The talent coordinator informed me that {{there was no point in}} my coming on the show if I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> custody battle because 'our viewers don't care about your music.

40|$|The {{relations}} hips {{between the}} image and the memory {{have been one of}} the most relevant subjects, in the critical, theoretical and academic relection, in the last decade. This refers specially to those manifestations connected to the traumatic memory. Photography and cinema, among other artistic expressions, have faced the way in which the violence’s memory and its features are revealed not only through the places, objects and bodies of the victims but the later generations. In this way, both memory and post-memory coexist and nourish many modern artistic practices in Latin America. In this paper, we are going to study some works created by several Argentinean artists and ilmmakers in which the corporality (the absence of ones’ bodies) plays an essential role. On one hand, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> violence victims’ (im-) possibility of representation, and on the other hand, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> resigniication of the temporality through this kind of works...|$|E
