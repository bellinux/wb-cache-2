40|$|Alternaria toxins are mycotoxins {{that can}} {{contaminate}} cereals, oilseeds and various {{fruits and vegetables}} such as apples, tomatoes, citrus fruits and olives. The fungi can grow at low temperatures, thus causing spoilage even during transport and storage. Currently, there are relatively little occurrence data on Alternaria toxins in food products and in the Netherlands most data are limited {{to the presence of}} alternariol (AOH) and alternariol methyl ether (AME) in cereals. Tenuazonic acid (TeA), tentoxin (TEN) and altenuene (ALT) have been recently identified by the Standing Committee on the food Chain and animal health as Alternaria toxins of concern. A survey (95 samples) was conducted in the Netherlands in 2013. The aim was to screen the levels of the five Alternaria toxins in wine (n = 5), fresh apples (n = 11), apple juices (n = 7), fresh tomatoes (n = 19), tomato sauces (n = 8), fresh citrus (n = 11), dried figs (n = 5), olives (n = 10), sunflower seeds (n = 5) and cereals (n = 14). Multi-mycotoxin methods for the analysis of mycotoxins were adapted for this purpose. Their performance characteristics were assessed and were as follows: recoveries and precision ranged from 85 to 112 % and from 4 to 20 %, respectively. LOQs were between 1. 5 and 5. 0 μg kg− 1. In the subsequent survey, AOH, AME, TeA, and TEN were detected in one or more food commodities, while ALT was not detected in any of the samples. TeA was found in 27 % of the samples and at relatively high concentrations in sunflower seeds, tomato sauces and dried figs (up to 2345 μg kg− 1).

While terumah gedolah was an agricultural tithe, the First-fruits, discussed in the Bikkurim tractate of the Talmud, were a sacrificial gift brought up to the altar (Bikkurim 3:12). The major obligation to bring First Fruits (henceforth: Bikkurim) to the Temple began at the festival of Shavuot and continued until the festival of Sukkot (Bikkurim 1:6). This tithe {{was limited to the}} traditional seven agricultural products (wheat, barley, grapes in the form of <b>wine,</b> <b>figs,</b> pomegranates, olives in the form of oil, and dates) grown in Israel. This tithe, and the associated festival of Shavuot, is legislated by the Torah. Textual critics speculate that these regulations were imposed long after the offerings and festival had developed.|$|R

The mountain of Marvão would also {{have served as a}} watchtower providing line-of-sight to the vitally-important Roman bridge at Alcántara. Local agricultural production (olives, <b>wine,</b> <b>figs,</b> cattle) was supplemented by horse-breeding, pottery, and mining activity - notably rock crystal and quartz from veins on the Marvão mountain, together with open cast gold mining on the Tagus to the north. Roman Ammaia saw the development of improved irrigation and terracing across the Marvão mountain. Chestnut cultivation - replacing the local dominance of oak - is likely to have been introduced at this time. Much of the terracing and ancient watercourses on the Marvão mountain date from this era.|$|R
25|$|In {{the port}} of Portimão local products, such as <b>figs,</b> olives, oil, <b>wine</b> and fish were {{regularly}} exported, while other products from the African and Brazilian colonies, such as slaves and sugar, were introduced into the Portuguese territory. But, by the 17th and 18th century, the rhythm of growth slowed considerably. As commerce decreased the inhabitants emigrated, a fact that accelerated after the 1755 earthquake, causing the destruction within the city. The main church was destroyed, {{while many of the}} small chapels were damaged. The city walls were severely damaged, not just by the earthquake but also the resulting tsunami. The Fort of Santa Catarina also suffered damage, but was reconstructed in 1792 and 1794, by the Count of Val de Reys. Twenty years after the earthquake, the Marquess of Pombal, wanted to make Portimão a bishopric, and in this evolution, he elevated the town to the status of city. Unfortunately, Queen Maria I of Portugal vetoed these intentions. The civil statute was only issued in 1924, by the Marquess' illustrious son Manuel Teixeira Gomes, as Republican President.|$|R
40|$|Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a {{mycotoxin}} {{produced by}} some Aspergillus and Penicillium species {{which is often}} detected in beer, cereals, coffee, feeds, <b>figs,</b> sultanas and <b>wine.</b> Some fungicides {{have been found to}} be effective in preventing fungal growth, but, in other cases, an increase in the synthesis of mycotoxins was reported. Also, the pressure to use less harmful compounds to the environment stimulates the exploration of new and more benign compounds. Synthetic compounds were tested on the growth and OTA production of one strain of A. alliaceus, A. ochraceus, A. carbonarius and A. niger. These new synthetic compounds have a linear structure incorporating urea and/or a phenolic unit. Fungi were grown in yeast extract sucrose (YES) medium supplemented with 50 μM to 200 μM of each one of 20 test compounds in triplicate, for 6 days. Growth was recorded by measuring the diameter of colonies every 24 hours, and OTA was quantified after 5 days of growth using HPLC and fluorescence detection. Growth of the A. ochraceus and the A. carbonarius strains were not inhibited by most of these compounds. However, some led to a decrease in OTA detection. Compounds without the phenolic unit were found to be less effective, while those compounds with urea and phenolic units were the most effective. Growth of the A. alliaceus and of the A. niger strains were inhibited by compound-X by 22 and 27 % respectively. This approach will lead to the selection of functional groups able to inhibit the synthesis of OTA which could be incorporated into more powerful antifungal compounds.

5000|$|The València plains {{are known}} for their olive, mulberry, ilex, algaroba, orange, and palm trees, with the {{appearance}} of an [...] "immense garden". Such is the fertility of the soil, that two and three crops in the year are generally obtained, and the greater part of the land returns eight per cent. The rice crops are the most valuable, and are chiefly produced in the tract which is irrigated by the Albufera, a large lake in the neighbourhood of València. Rice being the principal food of the lower classes, the crop is generally consumed in the province, {{with the exception of a}} small quantity which finds its way into Castile and Andalusia. The other chief product is the white mulberry, once the source of great wealth: it was worked in the silk-factories of València. In 1828, the produce of silk from the vega of València amounted to one million of pounds yearly, the greater part of which was exported in its raw state, but the produce has greatly increased since, owing to demands from the manufacturers of Lyon and other towns in the south of France. The province of València is a notable producer of satins, silk ribbons, and velvets. The export of fruit from Valencia is also considerable, particularly of raisins. The raisins are of two kinds, the muscatel, and an inferior and smaller raisin, called pasa de legia. The export of <b>figs,</b> oil, and <b>wine</b> from the province and ports of València is also considerable, with a wine known as Beni Carlo, which as of 1843 was shipped to Cette. Mercury, copper, sulphur, arsenic, argentiferous lead, iron, coal, etc. are among the mineral products, but they are procured only in small quantities. Today, tourism is a major source of income, with the city of Valencia and the resort towns along the coast being the primary earners during the summer months.|$|R
5000|$|The Godeffroys were French Huguenots of La Rochelle. In 1737 {{they were}} forced to flee France to avoid {{religious}} persecution after events following the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685. The family sought asylum in Prussia and finally settled in the port city of Hamburg, founding a trading empire known as J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn. At first the trade was in Western Europe and the West Indies with textiles as export item; the goods returning to Hamburg included copper, coffee, <b>wine,</b> <b>figs,</b> and sugar from Cuba. Under Johann Cesar VI Godeffroy outposts were established in Havana and in Valparaiso. He built a fleet of trading ships that, at its peak, numbered 29 deep water sailing vessels and some 100 smaller ships. Among these ships were the barques Johann Caesar, Peter Godeffroy, La Rochelle, Wandram, Suzanne, Iserbrook, Victoria, and until the economic crisis of 1857, the renowned American-built clipper Sovereign of the Seas. [...] In 1855, trade was expanded into the Pacific following negotiations by Godeffroy’s agent in Valparaiso, August Unselm. He sailed out to the Navigator Islands, The Friendly Islands, Fiji, and finally Tahiti.The trading business in the Pacific was very profitable and new outposts and plantations were established on many Pacific Islands. The goods were copra, coconut oil and luxuries such as pearl. In 1857, a central outpost, directing Pacific operations was established at Apia. Johann Godeffroy was also {{able to take advantage of}} an immigration scheme to Southern Africa and between October 1859 and September 1883 no less than 36 ships sailed for southern Africa, bringing hundreds of German families to the Western Cape, the Eastern Cape, British Kaffraria and Natal. After the financial crash of the late 1850, the firm supplemented its revenue by taking on passengers to the Australian gold rush and the California gold rush. The German imperial government utilized the Godeffroy company as part of its colonial policy in the Pacific Islands. Nevertheless, in 1878, the company went bankrupt due to speculations with German mining stocks and then emerged as Deutsche Handels- und Plantagen Gesellschaft der Südseeinseln zu Hamburg, or DHPG, with continuity and management by Godeffroy personnel.|$|R
60|$|Thirty Spartans bound {{themselves}} to help Lycurgus in his reform, and Charilaus, fancying it a league against himself, {{fled into the}} temple of Pallas, but his uncle fetched him out, {{and told him that}} he only wanted to make laws for making the Spartans great and noble. The rule was only for the real Dorian Spartans, the masters of the country, and was to make them perfect warriors. First, then, he caused all the landmarks to be taken up, and the lands thrown into one, which he divided again into lots, each of which was large enough to yield 82 bushels of corn in a year, with wine and oil in proportion. Then, to hinder hoarding, he allowed no money {{to be used in the}} country but great iron weights, so that a small sum took up a great deal of room, and could hardly be carried about, and thus there was no purchasing Phœnician luxuries; nor was anyone to use gold or ivory, soft cushions, carpets, or the like, as being unworthy of the race of Hercules. The whole Spartan nation became, in fact, a regiment of highly-disciplined warriors. They were to live together in public barracks, only now and then visiting their homes, and even when they slept there, being forbidden to touch food till they came to the general meal, which was provided for by contributions of meal, cheese, <b>figs,</b> and <b>wine</b> from each man’s farm, and a little money to buy fish and meat; also a sort of soup called black broth, which was so unsavoury that nobody but a Spartan could eat it, because it was said they brought the best sauce, namely, hunger. A boy was admitted as soon as he was old enough, and was warned against repeating the talk of his elders, by being told on his first entrance, by the eldest man in the company, “Look you, sir; nothing said here goes out there.” Indeed no one used more words than needful, so that short, pithy sayings came to be called Laconic. To be a perfect soldier was the great point, so boys were taught that no merit was greater than bearing pain without complaint; and they carried this so far, that a boy who had brought a young wolf into the hall, hidden under his tunic, let it bite him even to death without a groan or cry. It is said that they were trained to theft, and were punished, not for the stealing, but the being found out. And, above all, no Spartan was ever to turn his back in battle. The mothers gave the sons a shield, with the words, “With it, or on it.” The Spartan shields were long, so that a dead warrior would be borne home on his shield; but a man would not dare show his face again if he had thrown it away in flight. The women were trained to running, leaping, and throwing the bar, like the men, and were taught stern hardihood, so that, when their boys were offered to the cruel Diana, they saw them flogged to death at her altar without a tear. All the lives of the Spartans were spent in exercising for war, and the affairs of the state were managed not so much by the kings, but by five judges called Ephors, who were chosen every year, while the kings had very little power. They had to undergo the same discipline as the rest—dressed, ate, and lived like them; but they were the high priests and chief captains, and made peace or war.|$|R
40|$|Wine is an {{excellent}} source of various classes of polyphenols, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and trihydroxystilbene resveratrol (Fig. 1). Polyphenols {{play a major role in}} wine quality since they contribute to the sensory characteristics of wine, particularly color and astringency. A recent interest in these substances has been stimulated by abundant evidence of their beneficial effects on human health, such as anticarcinogenic, antiinflamatory and antimicrobial activities.

This paper reviews the current advances in the determination of polyphenols in wine by the major chromatographic techniques such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The great complexity of the polyphenolic content of wine and the difficulty in obtaining some of the standards usually require sample preparation before analysis. Two methods for sample preparation, liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction, are most commonly applied.

Densitometric quantitative analysis of polyphenols in wine extracts is usually performed by scanning the TLC plates with UV light at wavelengths of 350 – 365 nm or 250 – 260 nm (Fig. 3). For the evaluation of the most efficient mobile phase and an optimal choice of the combination of two or more mobile phases, two methods may be applied: information theory and numerical taxonomy. HPLC currently represents the most popular technique for the analysis of polyphenols in wine. For this purpose, a reversed-phase HPLC method that uses gradient elution with binary elution system is usually employed. Routine detection is based on measurement of UV-Vis absorption with a diode array detector (DAD). Enhancing selectivity and sensitivity for the determination of certain polyphenols requires the application of different detection techniques, such as fluorimetry (Fig. 4), electrochemistry, chemiluminescence, and/or mass spectrometry coupled with ionization techniques: electrospray (ESI), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). Gas chromatography (GC) methods developed for the analysis of polyphenols require derivatization to the volatile compounds and mass-spectrometric detection in the selective ion-monitoring mode (GC/MS-SIM). A special technique, capillary electrophoresis (CE), is a powerful tool for the analysis of polyphenol contents of white and red wines, with an opportune sample preconcentration step.
