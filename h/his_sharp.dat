5|$|The Judge {{was always}} {{headline}} news. He {{was a great}} showman, theatrical in appearance, with <b>his</b> <b>sharp</b> jaw and shock of white hair, and people always crowded into his courtroom, knowing there would be something going on. There were few dull moments.|$|E
5|$|His next {{opponent}} was unbeaten West Ham-based fighter Kevin Lear on 1 June 2002, {{again in}} Manchester, on the undercard of the Ricky Hatton vs. Eamonn Magee fight. Lear, a former Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABA) champion, kept a one-dimensional Gomez at bay with <b>his</b> <b>sharp</b> jab {{from the outset}} of the fight. Gomez took several punches to the face, and his nose began to bleed heavily starting in the sixth round. By the eighth round Gomez was slowing, suffering the effects of Lear's continuing barrage of combinations. At the end of the eighth round Gomez's trainer Brian Hughes retired his fighter, giving Lear a surprise victory.|$|E
5|$|Marshall did {{not believe}} in rule by the masses, {{frequently}} expressing his disdain for the common people. <b>His</b> <b>sharp</b> wit and lack of tact in writing did little to endear him to his neighbors. Like most of the members of his family, he subscribed to Federalist principles, although the majority of Kentuckians were affiliated with the Democratic-Republicans. He was also ostracized by many of his neighbors for being zealously antireligious. He wrote pamphlets denouncing religion of all kinds and published them at his own expense. His later descendants were so embarrassed of his anti-religious writings that they had his personal papers burned.|$|E
50|$|An unillustrated {{copy of the}} {{material}} from 1189 to 1250, with much of <b>his</b> <b>sharper</b> commentary about Henry III toned down or removed, was supervised by Paris himself and now exists as British Library Cotton MS Nero D V, fol. 162-393.|$|R
50|$|He retired on January 20, 1953, {{the last}} day of the Truman administration, and served on the Yale Board of Trustees along with Senator Robert A. Taft, one of <b>his</b> <b>sharpest</b> critics. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1955.|$|R
60|$|Resolved to hide these new, and--as it latently {{seemed to}} him--unworthy pangs, from Isabel, as also their cause, he quitted his chamber, {{intending}} a long vagabond stroll {{in the suburbs}} of the town, to wear off <b>his</b> <b>sharper</b> grief, ere he should again return into her sight.|$|R
5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and <b>his</b> <b>sharp</b> eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} Reitz {{found it hard}} to make a living, as competition among lawyers in Cape Town was quite severe at this time. Nevertheless, he succeeded in making a name for himself, due to <b>his</b> <b>sharp</b> legal mind and his social intelligence. Being part of the western Circuit Court of the Cape Colony gave him a lot of experience in a very short time. At the same time, Reitz nurtured his political interests by writing lead articles for the Cape Argus newspaper, for which he also reported on the proceedings of the Cape Parliament and acted as deputy editor. In 1870 Reitz moved his legal practice to Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State. The discovery of diamonds {{on the banks of the}} Vaal River, Reitz thought, would lead to a growth of legal work and enable him to set up a thriving practice. This was not to be, however, and after a few months Reitz left Bloemfontein to set up as a diamond prospector in Griqualand West, where he bought a small claim near Pniel from the Berlin Missionary Society. This enterprise also proved unsuccessful, and again after only a few months Reitz returned to Cape Town. This time, his Cape Town law practice was successful, ironically because of the British annexation of the Orange Free State diamondfields (1871) and the economic prosperity this emanated for the Cape Colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} {{deterioration in}} Rhodes's bowling {{continued into the}} 1906 season when Wisden commented {{that he had lost}} <b>his</b> <b>sharp</b> spin and was not dangerous on a hard wicket. Rhodes scored 1,721 runs, now regularly opening the batting, and completed another double with 128 wickets, but the Wisden correspondent did not believe this compensated for his lost bowling. In 1907, Rhodes scored fewer runs and increased his bowling aggregate, securing 173 wickets in a wet season. Wisden believed his greater bowling success was due to a reduced batting contribution, but he still completed the double by scoring 1,045 runs. During that season, Rhodes was again asked to open the batting for Yorkshire and he was chosen as the permanent replacement for John Tunnicliffe as Yorkshire's opening batsman. Several batsmen had been tried in the position, but Rhodes's superior defensive technique with the bat secured him the role. Despite the increase in wickets, Rhodes was not picked for any of the Tests that year against South Africa, Colin Blythe being preferred.|$|E

50|$|Again uniting {{his talents}} {{with those of}} Dušan Kovačević, Stojković {{delivered}} his ultimate film performance - that of the staunch Stalinist and a full-time paranoid in Balkanski špijun (Balkan Spy, 1984), which was jointly directed by Božidar Nikolić and Kovačević himself. With Kovačević at <b>his</b> <b>sharpest,</b> Stojković made the role of ex-political prisoner Ilija Čvorović completely his own.|$|R

25|$|Martin was an {{effective}} legislator but <b>his</b> <b>sharp</b> tongue and intemperate speeches to the House made him few friends among his parliamentary colleagues.

50|$|Politically, Kassner {{saw himself}} early on as a European {{who tried to}} {{characterize}} the peoples of Europe without favoring <b>his</b> own. <b>His</b> <b>sharpest</b> criticism is often reserved for the Germans. In spite of his youthful enthusiasm for Treitschke and Chamberlain he was never openly antisemitic; he married a woman of Jewish ancestry. Nevertheless, derogatory comments about Jews and Jewish stereotypes {{can be found in}} his writing (cf. Schmölders in Neumann/Ott 1999).|$|R
25|$|Darren Shane Berry (born 10 December 1969) is {{a former}} Australian cricketer who was known for <b>his</b> <b>sharp</b> skills as a wicketkeeper, first with South Australia and then Victoria in the Sheffield Shield and ING Cup {{domestic}} competitions.

25|$|During the Gettysburg Campaign of 1863, despite <b>his</b> <b>sharp</b> {{political}} differences with Pennsylvania's Republican Governor Andrew G. Curtin, Governor Seymour dispatched significant quantities of New York State Militia to Harrisburg to help repel {{the invasion of}} Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. The first Union soldier killed on Pennsylvania soil was a native Pennsylvanian, Corporal William H. Rihl serving in a company assigned to the 1st New York Cavalry.|$|E
25|$|Okajima's pitches are {{of lower}} than average velocity, {{forcing him to}} develop a more {{consistent}} release point to better control them. His fastball is usually in the 85–89mph range, rarely ever reaching 90mph. His out pitch in Japan was <b>his</b> <b>sharp</b> rainbow curveball in the 70–75mph range, which left-handed hitters find hard to hit. He also occasionally throws a circle changeup, a forkball in the 80–84mph range and changeup usually 82–84mph.|$|E
5000|$|Stewart Mason of AllMusic {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review, complimenting {{the tone of}} [...] "suppressed menace", and saying that [...] "it features some of <b>his</b> <b>sharpest</b> lyrics of the era". In addition, Debra Rae Cohen of Rolling Stone said that although Edmunds' version was [...] "cocky and rowdy", [...] "Costello restores the tune's paranoiac underpinnings with the nervous quaver of his voice and soft keyboard parts that echo like footfalls".|$|R

25|$|In The Times newspaper, {{columnist}} Martin Samuel {{described the}} show as “a tragic, self-serving procession of freaks, misfits, sad sacks and hopelessly damaged human beings” and its guests as “a collection of angry, tearful and broken people, whose inexperience of talking through painful, contentious, volatile issues leaves them unprepared and inadequate for a confrontation of this nature” whilst noting that they “can only appear intellectually inferior to the host, too, with <b>his</b> <b>sharp</b> suit and well-rehearsed confidence”.|$|E
25|$|De Kadt was a Labour Party (Partij van de Arbeid) {{member of}} the Dutch {{parliament}} from 1948 to 1963. He served for many years as the party's principal spokesman on foreign affairs, though his outspoken stance on Indonesian independence (of which he was a vigorous early protagonist) and <b>his</b> <b>sharp,</b> unqualified, opposition to Stalinism and the Soviet system ruled him out as a contender for the Ministerial position that was held by Joseph Luns. De Kadt was a regular radio commentator during these years. His contribution to Dutch public life and service was recognized in 1959 when he was awarded a knighthood in the Order of the Netherlands Lion.|$|E
25|$|Tattersall had {{an unusual}} style, quite {{different}} from the orthodox Jim Laker, who kept him out of a Test place for most of his career. Tattersall held his index finger around the seam of the ball and this allowed him to bowl a carefully disguised away-swinger to supplement <b>his</b> <b>sharp</b> off-break. He was rather faster than Laker, and this served to increase his penetration on the many wet wickets of his home county. Of small account as a batsman, he did nonetheless help Reg Simpson in a tenth wicket stand of 74 which helped to give England its first victory over Australia since their record win at The Oval in 1938.|$|E
50|$|Many of Watts' {{cartoons}} {{highlighted the}} class distinctions {{that existed in}} Britain in the nineteen-twenties and thirties. They offered a social commentary and an acute observation of differences in accent, vocabulary, dress, drinking habits and even table manners. Some of <b>his</b> <b>sharpest</b> barbs were aimed at the 'modern' art of the period, the nouveau riche, day trippers, social climbers and hen-pecked husbands. His contorted figures in paint, plaster and stone are clever caricatures of what he saw around him.|$|R

Club {{gave the}} album a grade of B, writing, [...] "Musically, ExitingARM {{is just as}} layered, blenderizing beats, sampled {{electronic}} noise, and Doseone's easygoing, flowing words into a package that's sometimes electrifying and sometimes confounding." [...] Eric Grandy of The Stranger said, [...] "Throughout ExitingARM, frontman Doseone remains an inscrutable MC, quick-tongued and verbose, and an unassuming but surprisingly fluid singer, whispering melodies in multitracked reverb to contrast <b>his</b> <b>sharper</b> falsetto raps." ...|$|R

25|$|Kočić {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} Bosnian Serb politicians of the Austro-Hungarian era, as well as one of the most important South Slavic playwrights of the 20th century. He was noted for <b>his</b> <b>sharp</b> wit and fiery temperament, which the Austro-Hungarian authorities frequently found themselves on the receiving end of. Kočić's works not only influenced an entire generation of Bosnian-Herzegovinian intellectuals, such as future Nobel laureate Ivo Andrić, but also the Serbian and Yugoslav nationalist movements, as well as the Bosnian autonomist and Yugoslav communist movements. Numerous streets in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia carry his name, and his likeness has appeared on Bosnian 100 KM banknotes since 1998.|$|E
25|$|Moyles uses zoo format, and {{therefore}} relies {{on his team}} members and audience participation for his show's games and quizzes and for other sources of comedy. He is renowned for <b>his</b> <b>sharp</b> manner, quick temper and put-downs. It is this approach which most commonly leads to criticism of Moyles. It has also caused him {{to become involved in}} numerous controversies related to perceived offensive statements. However, Moyles generally accepts counter-attacks in the same manner and routinely derides himself for being overweight and so forth, often in the lyrics of jingles. Due to his fascination with radio, Moyles regularly discusses the process of making the show, often spoofing clichéd radio practices. Many of his show's features are homages to or exaggerations of other radio features.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} on 11 February 1891 in Hillingdon, and was highly {{successful}} in local games even as a teenager, so that Middlesex engaged him soon after his eighteenth birthday in 1909. He was an immediate success with <b>his</b> <b>sharp</b> spin, coming second in the Middlesex averages behind Frank Tarrant, whilst in 1910, though erratic, he accomplished a sensational performance against Essex, taking 7 wickets for 2 runs in 25 balls. That year, still a teenager, Hearne made two hundred for Middlesex, and in the dry summer of 1911, he went from strength to strength. His major feats that year were 234 against Somerset, 6 for 17 against Essex and nine wickets in nine overs for 40 runs against Surrey, all at Lord's. In all, he took 102 wickets and scored 1627 runs {{at an average of}} 42.81, and was named as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden.|$|E
50|$|Santayana's one novel, The Last Puritan, is a bildungsroman, {{centering}} {{on the personal}} growth of its protagonist, Oliver Alden. His Persons and Places is an autobiography. These works also contain many of <b>his</b> <b>sharper</b> opinions and bons mots. He wrote books and essays {{on a wide range}} of subjects, including philosophy of a less technical sort, literary criticism, the history of ideas, politics, human nature, morals, the influence of religion on culture and social psychology, all with considerable wit and humor.|$|R
5000|$|Mark Deming of AllMusic states that, {{while the}} album is [...] "not a masterpiece," [...] it is worth a listen. [...] "If the {{arrangements}} and production are noticeably more tricked up than the minimal perfection of Haggard's 1960s sides and these lyrics aren't <b>his</b> <b>sharpest</b> meditations on the male/female relationship, {{for the most part}} Keep Movin' On finds Hag in worthy form, and 'Always Wanting You,' 'A Man's Got to Give Up a Lot,' and 'September in Miami' are memorable if lesser-known numbers." ...|$|R
60|$|The victim having once got his stroke-of-grace, the {{catastrophe}} {{can be considered}} as almost come. There is small interest now in watching his long low moans: notable only are <b>his</b> <b>sharper</b> agonies, what convulsive struggles he may take to cast the torture off from him; and then finally the last departure of life itself, and how he lies extinct and ended, either wrapt like Caesar in decorous mantle-folds, or unseemly sunk together, like one that had not the force even to die.|$|R
