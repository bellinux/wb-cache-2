40|$|The fi rst {{step of the}} laparoscopic {{resection}} of {{the colon}} is dissection or embolisation of the artery leading to the tumor. There are dissections of the inferior mesenteric <b>artery</b> or superior <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> during resection of the rectosigmoid colon. Methods During resection of the rectosigmoid colon we perform dissection or embolisation of the superior <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> as the fi rst step. Than we resect the rectosigmoid colon. Results 74 procedures on the left colon and rectosigmoid colon were performed from January 1 st, 2002 to May 31 st, 2003 in the Hospital Podlesí. Complications included wound infections in 7 cases (9. 4 %) and failure of anastomosis in 2 cases (1. 5 %). The reason for this was ischaemia of the left colon during rectosigmoid resection. We had to perform a “second look ” revision and left colectomy with a terminal transversostomy. Conclusion Dissection or embolisation of the vessels leading to the tumor area {{is the first step}} during malignancies of the colon. In case of the rectosigmoid tumor it is the superior <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> that has to be dissected or embolised. During strict dissection or embolisation of this artery ischaemia of the left colon with failure of the descendensrectal anastomosis occurred as a complication. Even a precise dissection of superior <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> can lead to ischaemia of the left colon.

Mesenteric angiography identified bleeding from a branch of the superior <b>rectal</b> <b>artery.</b> <b>Rectal</b> mucosa pressure necrosis secondary to the indwelling Flexi-Seal � Fecal Management System was diagnosed. The patient required an 11 -unit transfusion of packed red cells. Following intraarterial coil embolization of the superior <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> the bleeding abated. Indwelling bowel management systems are commonly used in immobile and critically ill patients with diarrhoea or faecal incontinence.

40|$|AbstractElective transanal Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery {{ligation}} (DG-HAL) {{has recently}} {{been shown to be}} effective in hemorrhoidal disease. It consists of ligating the terminal branches of the superior <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> under Doppler guidance, {{in order to reduce the}} hemorrhoidal arterial blood flow and improve the symptoms. By analogy, we propose performing this arterial occlusion using the “emborrhoid” technique (embolization of the hemorrhoidal arteries), in which arterial occlusion is achieved via the endovascular route using coils placed in the terminal branches of the superior <b>rectal</b> <b>arteries.</b> Three patients have been treated by this new technique, and the observations show that it is feasible and reproducible, with no ischemic complications or pain. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this technique for the treatment of hemorrhoidal disease...|$|R
40|$|Pelvic arteriographies of 51 {{cases were}} {{performed}} by Seldinger's method {{with use of}} autoinjector. Out of 51 cases, 10 cases were patients of non-prostatic disease (elder than 40 years old), 21 cases were ones of benign prostatic hypertrophy and 20 cases were ones of prostatic cancer. 1) On pelvic arteriograms, main nutrient vessels of the prostate were branches of inferior vesical <b>artery,</b> middle <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> and internal pudendal artery. 2) Inferior vesical artery originated from internal pudendal artery (27. 2 %), inferior gluteal artery (25. 2 %), umbilical ligament (18. 4 %) or the others. Findings of asymmetrical running of left and right inferior vesical artery or dilatation of one were seen in some cases of benign prostatic hypertrophy or prostatic cancer, though were not seen in ones of non-prostatic disease. 3) Middle <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> originated from internal pudendal artery (53 %), inferior vesical artery (12 %), inferior gluteal artery (9 %) or the others. Findings of asymmetrical running ofleft and right middle <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> or dilatation of one were seen in some cases of benign prostatic hypertrophy or prostatic cancer, though were not seen in ones or non-prostatic disease. 4) Internal pudendal artery originated from internal iliac artery (51 %), pudendo-gluteal trunk (33 %), inferior gluteal artery (11 %) or the others. Branches of internal pudendal artery which distributed to the prostate were seen in some cases of benign prostatic hypertrophy or prostatic cancer, though were not seen in ones of non-prostatic disease. 5) In some cases, pelvic arteriograms showed branches of superior <b>rectal</b> <b>artery,</b> superior vesical artery, lateral sacral artery or middle sacral artery, which distributed to prostate with exception of branches of three main arteries as mentioned above...|$|R
50|$|Transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (THD) uses a {{specially}} developed anoscope {{combined with a}} Doppler transducer to identify the hemorrhoidal arteries (originating from the superior <b>rectal</b> <b>artery)</b> 2-3 cm above the pectinate line. Once the superior <b>rectal</b> <b>arteries</b> are isolated with the doppler, a suture ligation is performed to effectively decrease the {{blood flow to the}} hemorrhoidal plexus. In case of redundant prolapse, the prolapsed mucosal membrane is lifted and sutured (with the last suture minimum 5 mm above the pectinate line), repositioning hemorrhoidal cushions in situ.This is different from a traditional hemorrhoidectomy, which focused on excising the hemorrhoidal bundle. In this procedure there is no tissue that is excised. Because the suture line is above the pectinate line, post-operative pain is minimized for patients. THD can be performed with conscious sedation, local or general anesthesia.|$|R

50|$|The {{inferior}} vesical artery is {{a branch}} (direct or indirect) of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery.

40|$|One of {{the main}} causes of local {{recurrence}} of rectal cancer is the regional lymphatic nodes metastasis.

Twenty-three articles that evaluated oncologic outcome (n= 14), anastomotic circulation (n= 5), autonomous innervation (n= 5), and tension on the anastomosis/anastomotic leakage (n= 2) matched our selection criteria and were systematically reviewed. There is insufficient evidence to support high tie as the technique of choice. Furthermore, high tie has been proven to decrease perfusion and innervation of the proximal limb. It is concluded that neither the high tie strategy nor the low tie strategy is evidence based and that low tie is anatomically less invasive with respect to circulation and autonomous innervation of the proximal limb of anastomosis. As a consequence, in rectal cancer surgery low tie should be the preferred method. KEY WORDS: Total mesorectal excision; Rectal cancer...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} present the early experience of treating hemorrhoids with HAL-RAR. Methods: Between December 2008 and November 2009, 70 consecutive patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids were treated with HAL-RAR. The patients underwent sonographic identification and suture ligation of 4 to 8 terminal branches of the superior <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> above the dentate line. Results: There were 33 males and 37 females (mean age, 49. 72 ± 14. 1 years). The mean operative time was 43. 8 minutes (25 ∼ 80 min). Most patients (= 61, 87 %) were without any complaint upon follow-up at 1 week. Nine patients presented with early complication: isolated pain in 1, anemia in 1, isolated bleeding in 1, voiding difficulty (over 1 day) in 2 and tenesmus (over 2 weeks) in 4.
