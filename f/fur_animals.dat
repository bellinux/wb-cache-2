25|$|So far, 45 {{species of}} mammals {{are found in}} Zasavica. It is ideal for the water-bound species like Eurasian otter or wildcat, which are {{protected}} all over Europe. Otters were not spotted for years though. Recent but unconfirmed sightings of otters recently prompted the ecology organisations from Sremska Mitrovica to announce an award for those who capture otter on camera. <b>Fur</b> <b>animals</b> also live in Zasavica, most notably muskrat. Eurasian shrew, striped field mouse, fat dormouse and several species of bats are listed as rarities in Serbia.|$|E

500|$|The {{maritime}} trade also brought {{changes to the}} natives' traditional seasonal migration patterns and settlement locations. The coastal people were [...] "cosmopolitanized", that is, they were incorporated into a global market economy. At first their main export was furs, later supplemented and replaced by salmon, lumber, and artwork. By the late 19th century the North West Coast was famous for its arts and crafts, especially large works like totem poles, causing a flourishing of indigenous art. The natives imported many western goods and soon became dependent on many, such as firearms and metal tools. Textiles became a vital trade item during the early maritime fur trade era. The value of furs caused a shift in native dress from furs to textiles, which was reinforced by the general depletion of <b>fur</b> <b>animals.</b> Firearms had {{both positive and negative}} effects. They made hunting much more efficient but also made warfare much more deadly.|$|E

50|$|In a {{time when}} {{centralized}} political control {{in the fields of}} genetics and agriculture promoted Lysenkoism as an official state doctrine, Belyayev's commitment to classical genetics had cost him his job as head of the Department of <b>Fur</b> <b>Animal</b> Breeding at the Central Research Laboratory of Fur Breeding in Moscow in 1948.

While being a head of the Division of Fur Resources, in 1930, he got a job as a Commissioner General for the United States at the International Fur Trade Exposition and later at the Congress in Leipzig, Germany. He stayed with the Fish and Wildlife Service, which was a successor to Biological Survey, until he got p-romoted in 1957 as a Civilian-in-charge of Wild <b>Fur</b> <b>Animal</b> Investigations. He was the first head of such Division. The Division was transferred, with the Bureau, into the Department of the Interior in 1939, and in 1947 the functions that were related to breeding, producing, and marketing of the Division, were transferred and renamed into the Animal Husbandry Research Division, and became a part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.|$|R
50|$|After 1922, {{with the}} advent of the system of fishing kolkhozes and state fishery enterprises, several fishing {{facilities}} were located on the island.

40|$|<b>Fur</b> <b>animal</b> feed {{production}} in Finland Annually approximately 400 million kg <b>fur</b> <b>animal</b> feed is manufactured in Finland. The feed is manufactured mainly from domestic feedstuffs. Vitamins and minerals are also {{added to the}} feed {{to meet the requirements}} of the animals. Fresh feed is composed almost 80 % of meat by-products, fish and cooked or dehydrated barley. In addition, meat and fish meals are also added. Feedstuffs, such as soybean meal or soy concentrate, corngluten and wheatgluten meals, potato protein and are also used when economically viable to do so. Mainly the slaughterhouse by-products and fox carcasses are acidified. Finnish Food Safety Authority controls the use of acids and preservatives. Due to national legislation all slaughter by-products at Finnish slaughterhouses must be acidified to pH 4. 0 or below before the by-products may leave the slaughterhouse. According to national legislation slaughter by-products must be grinded to a maximum particle size of 50 mm and the by-products must be treated with either sorbic acid or benzoic acid to prevent outgrowth of yeast and moulds. The most common combination for preservation is formic acid and Na-benzoate. Also sulphuric acid, formic acid- lactic acid solution and sodium metabisulphite solution have been used. Neutralisation is used in Finland. Most common way of neutralisation is the use of soda (Na 2 CO 3). Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) is also used. Every 15 feed kitchen in Finland take part in a systematic feed quality control by Finnish Fur Breeders Association (FFBA). The quality control requires minimum 2 feed samples per month from each feed kitchen. Feed samples are analysed in an accredited <b>Fur</b> <b>Animal</b> Feed Laboratory (FFBA) and the analysed results are reported monthly to the authorities. The formic acid content (85 % HCOOH) is analysed during March - August twice a month. vo...|$|R

The farmers community is to 90% situated {{in the rural areas}} of Ostrobothina and employs 4-6000 persons. Today the Fur farming is strictly regulated by law and animal household regulations. The Finnish Furbreeders Association has developed its own national program of Certification and animal health welfare that is tied to the ISO 9001 standard and monitored by the Norske Veritas. The <b>fur</b> <b>animals</b> are housed in shelter buildings or halls, where each animal has a specific place marked with a kit card.
