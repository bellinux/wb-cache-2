25|$|The International Boundary is {{commonly}} referred to as the world's longest undefended border, but this is true only in the military sense, as civilian law enforcement is present. It is illegal to cross the border outside border controls. Everyone crossing the border must be checked. The relatively low level of security measures stands in contrast to that of the United States– Mexico border (one-third as long as the Canada–U.S. border), which is actively patrolled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel to prevent <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> and drug trafficking.|$|E
25|$|<b>Illegal</b> <b>migration</b> (Aliyah Bet) {{became the}} main form of Jewish entry into Palestine. Across Europe Bricha ("flight"), an {{organization}} of former partisans and ghetto fighters, smuggled Holocaust survivors from Eastern Europe to Mediterranean ports, where small boats tried to breach the British blockade of Palestine. Meanwhile, Jews from Arab countries began moving into Palestine overland. Despite British efforts to curb immigration, during the 14 years of the Aliyah Bet, over 110,000 Jews entered Palestine. By the end of World War II, the Jewish population of Palestine had increased to 33% of the total population.|$|E

The Agency's intelligence directorate conducts a border risk assessment of its border operations every 2–3 years. Under this process, the Agency assesses the risks of smuggling contraband, such as drugs, firearms, proceeds of crime, child pornography, illicit tobacco etc. The information is assessed and ranked by commodity and by mode of transport. The Agency will include the risks of irregular or <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> of people, {{and the movement of}} food, plants, and animals, now under the Agency's broader mandate, in the next version of its border risk assessment.|$|E
40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} U. S. border enforcement on the net flow of Mexican undocumented migration, {{both of which have}} been considerably increasing in the last three decades. This effect is theoretically ambiguous, as increases in border controls deter prospective migrants from crossing the border illegally but lengthen the duration of current <b>illegal</b> <b>migrations.</b> The inflow and outflow of <b>illegal</b> Mexican <b>migration</b> respond to changes in border enforcement. The marginal effect of enforcement on the inflow increases with enforcement and is consistent with the hypothesis that tighter enforcement selects more productive migrants. This positive selection makes the outflow sensitivity to marginal enforcement changes comparatively more stable over time. A marginal increase in border controls increases the stock of undocumented migrants between 1972 and 1986, has either no effect or a small and negative effect between 1987 and 1996, and has a larger and significant negative effect between 1997 and 2003...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of U. S. border {{enforcement}} on the net flow of Mexican undocumented migration. It shows how this effect is theoretically ambiguous, given that in-creases in border controls deter prospective migrants from crossing the border illegally, but lengthen the duration of current <b>illegal</b> <b>migrations.</b> It then estimates the impact of enforce-ment on 1972 - 1993 migration net flows by merging aggregate enforcement data with micro data on potential and current illegal Mexican migrants. The econometric model accounts for the endogeneity of border controls using the Drug Enforcement Administration budget as an instrumental variable. Both the inflow and outflow of <b>illegal</b> Mexican <b>migration</b> are highly sensitive to changes in border enforcement. The estimates of the enforcement overall effect on illegal migration’s net flow range across different specifications, from a decline- about 35 % {{of the size of}} the effect on the inflow- to an increase. Thus, they suggest that border enforcement may not be an effective means to reduce the level of the illegal alien population in the United States...|$|R

25|$|According to Zbigniew Dumienski, {{the very}} concept of human {{trafficking}} is murky and misleading. It has been argued that while human trafficking is commonly seen as a monolithic crime, in reality it is an act of <b>illegal</b> <b>migration</b> that involves various different actions: some of them may be criminal or abusive, but others often involve consent and are legal. Laura Agustin argues that not everything that might seem abusive or coercive is considered as such by the migrant. For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'. Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.|$|E
25|$|China's chief {{interest}} {{in the region of}} the Great Golden Peninsula was the expansion of its economic activities, namely trade. Foreign trade has been a very significant factor in maintaining stability and in contributing to growth in China. Chinese merchants were constantly pushing south as trade with Burma thrived. The Chinese province of Yunnan – where the Mekong River, previously used for <b>illegal</b> <b>migration,</b> flows - is China's main avenue for trade with the Nanyang. Yunnan is a landlocked province that possesses a well-developed industrial base with cheap labor and a fast-growing economy. Its proximity to the Nanyang region has been complemented by its remoteness from Beijing's control – the region was the last stronghold of anti-communist forces. It has for years sought a foreign market for its goods and an outlet to sea; due to the ideal conditions described above and its easy access to the Mekong River, it has begun gaining access to the several markets of the Nanyang, particularly Burma and Laos.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 165 - 176). Between 2004 and 2012, United States Border Patrol (USBP) apprehensions of Mexican nationals {{along the}} US-Mexico border declined to numbers {{not seen since}} the early 1970 s. Scholars and immigration experts have attempted to explain the current declines by looking at the same three factors that have historically been associated with causing the rise in illegal Mexican migration: immigration policy changes in the United States, demographic changes in Mexico, and economic factors in Mexico and the United States. In addition, scholars and immigration experts have continued to dismiss border enforcement as a possible explanatory variable, despite specific findings in much of their own research suggesting otherwise. 	I analyze the three historic causes of <b>illegal</b> Mexican <b>migration</b> and argue that they in fact could not have been responsible for the decline in USBP Mexican apprehensions since the mid- 2000 s. I found that while there have been some changes within these three factors; the changes have not been significant enough to cause a 40 -year low in Southwest Border Mexican apprehensions. More importantly, I found that the only other factor that could have reduced <b>illegal</b> Mexican <b>migration</b> has been border enforcement. In fact, it is the only factor that has seen a significant change. The exponential increases in Southwest Border enforcement efforts since the mid- 2000 s, and the simultaneous decline in Mexican apprehensions along the US-Mexico border, suggests that border enforcement is the principal factor responsible for the historic drop in <b>illegal</b> Mexican <b>migration...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} {{mobility}} studies examines social phenomena {{through the lens}} of movement. In this perspective, societies are regarded as being constantly reconfigured as they are shaped by a series of mobile entities (capital, people, information). This book engages critically with many of the claims and challenges of mobility studies by providing empirically rich reports of mobilities and their limitations. Instead of assuming a seamless world of flows, the volume foregrounds questions of power, inequality, and moorings as integral to the movement of capital, goods, images, practices, or people. It brings together the work of several internationally renowned scholars, who engage with these movements at critical sites. This is the first book to provide a critical and interdisciplinary view of mobilities covering a broad range of issues rather than a single domain. The chapters deal with current and important issues, such as organ transplants, <b>illegal</b> <b>migrations,</b> urban globalization, international policies of higher education institutions, and scientific diasporas. As a whole, the book provides new insights into how power relations shape mobilities and societies...|$|R
