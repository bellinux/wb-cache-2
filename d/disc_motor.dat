40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{development of}} a disk slice bearingless motor. Such a motor belongs to the magnetic bearings technique. There are practical experiences with radial magnetic bearing (homopolar type) at the CTU Prague. The idea {{is based on the}} elimination of physical contacts between the shaft and its housing. It employs magnetic forces between the stator and the rotor to keep the rotor in a defined position inside the stator. There are industrial applications using all magnetic bearing advantages as no friction, almost no vibrations, no material fatigue, low service costs. A fully levitated shaft with two radial bearings and one thrust bearing is the classical conception of a bearingless motor. The idea of a <b>disc</b> slice bearingless <b>motor</b> is a simplified classical conception.

We conduct {{experimental study of}} friction-induced oscillations in a non-asbestos organic material / steel pair used in <b>disc</b> brakes of <b>motor</b> vehicles. The tests are done by use of a pin-on-disc machine in which the pin sample is supported on a deformable beam. The adjustable friction parameters are the disc velocity, contact pressure and temperature. The tests show that the friction coefficient decreases with the sliding velocity and increases with the temperature. The friction-induced tangential oscillation of the pin sample occurs with a frequency equal to the first natural frequency of the beam. The effects of the disc velocity and temperature on the oscillation characteristics are investigated. The oscillation amplitude increases with the disc velocity on the interval of velocities below 2 m/s. Temperature changes of several tens of degrees Celsius lead to the oscillation occurrence / decay. The obtained results can be useful for prognostication of friction-induced oscillations in disc brakes with non-asbestos organic pads...|$|R

Background: Optimizing clinical outcomes following lumbar disc surgery {{is a research}} priority; however, relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to the postoperative management of this population. The transversus abdominis and lumbar multifidus (LM) muscles appear to play a unique role in lumbar spine stability, and may relate to clinical outcome following lumbar disc surgery. The purpose of this case report was to describe the preoperative LM morphology, clinical outcome, and change in transversus abdominis and LM muscle activation in a patient following lumbar <b>disc</b> surgery and <b>motor</b> control exercise initiated in the early postoperative period. Case Description: A 29 -year-old female underwent an 8 -week postoperative rehabilitation program emphasizing motor control exercises to restore trunk muscle function 10 days following lumbar disc surgery. Outcomes: The patient experienced clinically important improvements in pain and disability following the postoperative rehabilitation program. Substantial improvements in muscle activation were observed of the transversus abdominis and the LM at the L 4 - 5 level. Minimal change in LM activation and a higher proportion of intramuscular fat was observed at the L 5 -S 1 level. Discussion: This case report represents limited evidence regarding the feasibility of instituting a rehabilitation program in the early postoperative period following lumbar disc surgery. Improvements in clinical status and muscle function were observed, and a differential change in muscle activation between the L 4 - 5 and L 5 -S 1 levels was noted. The literature regarding rehabilitation following lumbar disc surgery, as well as the neuromuscular changes observed in this population, was reviewed.

40|$|O objetivo deste estudo {{experimental}} foi avaliar a influência de diferentes bebidas (água destilada, café, chá, vinho tinto e whisky) na estabilidade de cor de quatro diferentes resinas compostas e a efetividade do polimento final para recuperação da coloração inicial. As resinas utilizadas foram Filtek Z 250 (microhíbrida), Filtek Z 350 (nanoparticulada), IPS Empress Direct (nanohíbrida) e Tetric N-Ceram (nanohíbrida). Foram confeccionados 200 corpos de prova (8 mm x 2 mm), sendo 50 para cada tipo de resina e polidos com disco Sof-Lex em motor elétrico. Um aparelho espectrofotômetro digital foi utilizado para verificação da coloração inicial, após essa avaliação as amostras foram separadas de acordo com a resina composta utilizada em grupos (n= 10) e permaneceram imersas nas respectivas soluções durante 14 dias. Após esse período os corpos de prova foram lavados e secos para nova avaliação da cor. Posteriormente os corpos de prova eram polidos e lavados para nova medição no espectrofotômetro. O sistema de parâmetro da coloração utilizado foi o CIEL*a*b*. As alterações de coloração foram verificadas a partir de ΔE 1 após 2 semanas e ΔE 2 seguinte ao repolimento. Valores acima de 3, 3 foram considerados inaceitáveis clinicamente. As diferenças de cor foram estatisticamente comparadas pelo ANOVA two-way e test de Tukey (p< 0, 05). Com os resultados foi possível observar que o vinho tinto apresentou a maior variação de ΔE seguido pelo café, chá, whisky e água destilada. A resina microhíbrida Filtek Z 250 apresentou a melhor estabilidade de cor em todas as substâncias líquidas. O repolimento final não foi efetivo para que as resinas compostas retornassem a sua coloração inicial e nenhuma das resinas apresentou estabilidade de cor clinicamente aceitável em qualquer das bebidas empregas neste estudo.

Color differences were statistically compared using ANOVA two-way and Tukey test (p < 0. 05). With the results was observed that red wine had the highest variation of ΔE followed by coffee, tea, whisky and distilled water.
