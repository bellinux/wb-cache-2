40|$|One of the {{products}} derived from the gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer (GOCE) observations are the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients.</b> These <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients</b> are provided in the gradiometer reference frame (GRF) and are calibrated in-flight using satellite shaking and star sensor data. To use these <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients</b> for application in Earth scienes and gravity field analysis, additional preprocessing needs to be done, including corrections for temporal gravity field signals to isolate the static gravity field part, screening for outliers, calibration by comparison with existing external gravity field information and error assessment. The temporal <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> corrections consist of tidal and nontidal corrections. These are all generally below the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> error level, which is predicted to show a 1 /f behaviour for low frequencies. In the outlier detection, the 1 /f error is compensated for by subtracting a local median from the data, while the data error is assessed using the median absolute deviation. The local median acts as a high-pass filter and it is robust as is the median absolute deviation. Three different methods have been implemented for the calibration of the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients.</b> All three methods use a high-pass filter {{to compensate for the}} 1 /f <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> error. The baseline method uses state-of-the-art global gravity field models and the most accurate results are obtained if star sensor misalignments are estimated along with the calibration parameters. A second calibration method uses GOCE GPS data to estimate a low-degree gravity field model as well as <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> scale factors. Both methods allow to estimate <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> scale factors down to the 10 ? 3 level.

30|$|In recent years, {{techniques}} for measuring gravitational potential fields have evolved from static to dynamic methods, and measurement instruments have also gradually advanced from ground measurement systems to aerial and satellite measurement systems. As the second derivative of the gravitational potential, the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> can satisfactorily reflect a high-frequency density change and help increase {{the resolution of}} the density structure. Full tensor of the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> can effectively help increase the amount of observation data. <b>Gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> data can reflect the shape and size of an underground anomalous body from various perspectives. While there are many components of the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient,</b> the inversion solution is non-unique. To constrain the non-unique problem of <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> data inversion, seismic data are introduced, which, together with the multiple components of the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient,</b> are subjected to a joint inversion to reduce the non-uniqueness of the inversion solution. In this study, based on a high-resolution P-wave velocity structure obtained from seismic tomography, a 3 D initial density model is constructed for the lithosphere in the NCC based on the empirical velocity–density conversion relation for North China. The GOCE satellite <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> data are processed. Considering that the anomalous <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> effect is a comprehensive reflection of a myriad of factors and non-unique problem, the anomalous <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> effect caused by the topographic relief at each underground layer interface is eliminated. In addition, by fully considering that the density distribution in the lithosphere is primarily collectively affected by its internal temperature and composition, the anomalous <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> effect caused by the internal temperature of the lithosphere is also eliminated. Separation of the temperature effects from the residual <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> anomalies provides constraints of the density changes due to variations in lithosphere and mantle composition. Thus, the anomalous <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> effect caused by the non-uniform matter density distribution is obtained. Based on the anomalous <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> components obtained, the preconditioned conjugate gradient inversion algorithm was adopted to calculate the horizontal density structure in the NCC. Because the Lagrange empirical parameter in the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) inversion algorithm exhibits uncertainty in data inversion, this algorithm is improved. The distribution of the density structure at various depths in the NCC is obtained through inversion and is analysed and interpreted based on the available geological and geophysical data.|$|R
50|$|The {{purposes}} of the TSS-1 mission were to verify the tether concept of <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>stabilization,</b> {{and to provide a}} research facility for investigating space physics and plasma electrodynamics. This mission uncovered several aspects about the dynamics of the tethered system, although the satellite did not fully deploy. It stuck at 78 meters; after that snag was resolved its deployment continued to a length of 256 meters before sticking again, where the effort finally ended (the total proposed length was 20,000 meters). A protruding bolt due to a late-stage modification of the deployment reel system, jammed the deployment mechanism and prevented deployment to full extension. Despite this issue, the results showed that the basic concept of long gravity-gradient stabilized tethers was sound. It also settled several short deployment dynamics issues, reduced safety concerns, and clearly demonstrated the feasibility of deploying the satellite to long distances.|$|E

40|$|Past {{application}} of the gravity gradient concept to satellite attitude control produced attitude stabilities of from 1 to 10 degrees. The satellite members were rigigly interconnected and any motion {{in one part of}} the satellite would cause motion in all members. This experience has restricted <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>stabilization</b> to applications that need attitude stability no better than 1 degree. A gravity gradient technique that combines the flexible tether with an active control that will allow control stability much better than 1 degree is proposed.

Two possible ways of demonstrating the techniques using the Tethered Satellite System (TSS) tether to control the attitude of the shuttle are proposed.

The satellite dimensions and inertia tensor {{are similar to}} the same characteristics of the spacecraft Foton and Progress. We consider two variants of the mode - the passive (uncontrollable) variant and the active (controllable) one. Electric propulsions are used for control of satellite attitude motion in the active variant. We check two conditions for both variants: the low level of residual accelerations on board the satellite and the stability of the motion (preservation of its basic properties {{over a long period of}} time, insensibility to errors in initial conditions). Checking is caring out by mathematical modeling of the satellite attitude motion. We demonstrate that the active variant provides the low level of accelerations but is not stable relative to errors in initial conditions of the motion. The active variant satisfies two conditions above. Interchange of these variants proves to be more economical: the electric propulsions operate only a few hours every 3 - 5 days to damp arising disturbed motion.

40|$|<b>Gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>stabilization</b> {{is planned}} for the space station. Torques arise from air-drag since the center of {{pressure}} {{is not the same}} as the center of mass of the satellite. The magnitude of these torques varies depending upon the orientation of the solar panels. Adjustments are made through the use of CMG's (Control Moment Gyros). In time, if the CMG's saturate, torque must be bled off using thrusters; however, that is undesirable because it expends propellant and contaminates the local environment. The task of the engineer is to design the CMG's to handle the aerodynamic torques and design the configuration of the spacecraft to prevent, if possible, CMG saturation. For this application the long-term atmospheric density trends are of less importance than the rate of change of density within an orbit. In principle, CMG's could be designed for the worst case of maximum solar activity, but the penalty for overdesign is excess mass and cost. In summary, present models are inadequate for this application with the greatest need being a reliable prediction of maximum rates-of-change of density within an orbit...|$|E

The issue of deployment and retrieval of tethers from orbiting spacecraft (the Space Shuttle is the currently used the parent spacecraft) is {{critical to the success of}} the tethered satellite mission. The problem of deployment and retrieval of tethers from the Space Shuttle is extremely complicated because it leads to nonlinear time varying differential equations. One of the methods proposed for deployment and retrieval of tethered satellites is the tension control law [1]. In this method, the tension in the tether is varied in accordance with s predetermined control law to extend or retrieve the tether to the required length, while minimizing the oscillations of the tether. The governing equations being nonlinear, Liapunov's second method may be used to determine the tension control law. This approach has two drawbacks: firstly, Liapunov functions can be found only by trial and error, and consequently, the experience of the analyst plays a major role in the selection of the control law. The relaxation of any one of the assumptions made in the derivation of the equations would lead to a new set of governing equations, which in turn implies a new problem as far as the determination of the Liapunov function is concerned. Secondly, the procedure leads to a nonlinear control law. Despite these limitations, Vadali [2] and Fujii and Ishijima [3] have successfully employed this technique...|$|E

The original LDEF was an excellent gravity gradient spacecraft, but because of its 9 m length and 9, 700 kg mass it was difficult to manifest on the Shuttle, for either launch or retrieval, in conjunction with other payloads. This paper discusses an LDEF follow-on spacecraft concept whose short stowed length (approximately 3 m) greatly improves Shuttle manifesting opportunities while still providing very large surface area exposure for experiments. Deployable 'wings' on each end of the short, 'cylindrical' main body of this new spacecraft provide the means for <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>stabilization</b> while greatly increasing the spacecraft surface area. The center section of the spacecraft is oriented with the end faces of the twelve sided, 4. 2 m diameter 'cylinder' perpendicular to the velocity vector thus providing large areas for experiments in both the ram and anti-ram directions as well as additional exposure area around the periphery of the cylinder. When deployed and properly oriented with the Shuttle's Remote Manipulator System (RMS), both wings of the spacecraft are oriented edge on to the direction of motion and lie in the plane which contains the local gravity vector. The relatively thin wings readily accommodate dual side exposure of glass plate stacks for cosmic ray detection.
