500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call. He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, [...] "No, baby...I had to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re {{on the phone with}} your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you have known for your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E

You don't want to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> in this situation [...] you could tell the operator wanted to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> because he's measured by how long his call is." [...] Employees are rated by how quickly they handle calls because in the past they had been criticized for taking too long to answer calls, causing callers to hang up. Wilkins also claims the technology is outdated, making it difficult to piece together different parts of a case from separate calls. He claimed to have plans to remedy these situations.|$|E

The ranks of company employees to meet that demand, however, were thinned by military call-ups. Caught without dial equipment {{in a situation where}} new equipment was impossible to procure, Rochester Telephone had difficulty handling the growing volume of calls. Customers were asked to limit the duration of their calls, and tones sounded every three minutes on the line to remind them to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> On long-distance calls, operators broke in every five minutes to tell callers that others were waiting to use the lines. In addition, Rochester Telephone received many orders for the installation of new equipment which it was unable to fill. By the war's end, the company's waiting list had grown to include 8,000 names.|$|E

He then goes off to complete his route for Hot Flash Pizza. However, Captain Kronious calls Milverstead with this information, and not John Keem.

5000|$|After Wilcox died in 2000, Rantzen {{wrote about}} her {{feelings}} of loneliness in two {{articles in the}} Daily Mail, {{and because of the}} huge response invented the concept of a new befriending helpline for older people, to be called The Silver Line. This helpline piloted at the end of 2012,(the pilot funded by Comic Relief was independently evaluated by the Centre for Social Justice in their report [...] "When I <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> I feel like I belong to the Human Race") and launched nationally in 2013. In the first two years it has made and received one million contacts from older people. Among first the major donors were the Big Lottery Fund, Swiss Re, and BT. The free phone line (0800 4 70 80 90) is the only confidential helpline for older people offering information, friendship and advice which is open 24/7, every day and night of the year. The CEO is Sophie Andrews, for 3 years Chair of the Samaritans.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pilot was}} greeted {{positively}} {{by most of}} the major charities and other organisations working in the field of elderly care. However, the head of Age Concern in Jersey initially said she liked the concept, but a new UK-based charity helpline would be confusing and unnecessary for the island.In fact the Jersey experience proved valuable not only in testing out ways of reaching the hardest-to-reach older people, but also by enabling them to call the helpline, in some calls revealing situations involving loneliness and abuse. Evaluated independently by the Centre for Social Justice, during the pilot period the helpline was found to have been transformational. One caller told the evaluation, [...] "When I <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> I feel like I belong to the human race". Another said she no longer felt {{as if she had been}} [...] "shuffled under the carpet." [...] It was therefore launched nationally on November 25, 2013.|$|E
