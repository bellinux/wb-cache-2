25|$|The Portuguese Inquisition (Portuguese: Inquisição Portuguesa) was {{formally}} established in Portugal in 1536 {{at the request}} of its king, John III. Manuel <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> for the installation of the Inquisition in 1515 to fulfill the commitment of marriage with Maria of Aragon, but it was only after his death that Pope Paul III acquiesced. In the period after the Medieval Inquisition, it was one of three different manifestations of the wider Christian Inquisition along with the Spanish Inquisition and Roman Inquisition.|$|E
500|$|Eleanor {{dismissed}} Bamie's criticisms {{by referring}} to her as an [...] "aged woman." [...] Bamie and Eleanor eventually reconciled, and {{in an article in}} the Ladies Home Journal, [...] "How to Take Criticism," [...] Eleanor referred to her, saying, [...] "I can honestly say that I hate no one, and perhaps the best advice I can give to anyone who suffers from criticism and yet must be in the public eye, would be contained in the words of my aunt, Mrs. William Sheffield Cowles. She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> her whether I should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are sure that you are doing what seems right to you, but be sure that you face yourself honestly.'" [...] Theodore's elder daughter Alice also broke with Eleanor over her campaign. Alice and Eleanor reconciled after Eleanor wrote Alice a comforting letter upon the death of Alice's daughter, Paulina Longworth.|$|E
500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Lady Lovel. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> {{much from}} her, {{and she has}} given me all that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> nothing, and now claim nothing, as payment for service done. If Lady Anna thinks she is in my debt after such fashion as that, I will soon make her free." ...|$|R
5000|$|His hand will say, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> stolen {{such and}} such; his lip willsay, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> {{such and such}} questions; ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I simply {{mean that}} even {{you could hardly}} <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> Miss Effingham such a question. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> her, and she has refused me." ...|$|R
2500|$|I saw a fresh, new {{conception}} of layout technique {{that struck me}} like a revelation: pages that [...] "bled" [...] beautifully cropped photographs, typography and design that were bold and arresting. Within ten minutes <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> Brodovitch to have cocktails with me, and that evening I signed him to a provisional contract as art director.|$|E
2500|$|My {{first meeting}} with Adm. James Holloway was some experience. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> to brief him on our plan for Jordan and was shown to his office. He was {{reclining}} on a sofa and remained that way throughout the session. When I would make a particular point, he would exclaim, 'Atta boy,' or 'That's it. Give'm hell' [...] a one-man cheering section, so to speak. It was quite the most incredible briefing I ever gave. I learned later that he suffered from some ailment at the time, which required him to take these rest sessions. He impressed me as a 'big picture' type, not too interested in details, but I left his office feeling that {{here was a man}} for whom you would make that extra effort and take that extra step." ...|$|E
60|$|There he stopped. I put a {{question}} to him--the first that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> yet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey Clouston, {{the usual}} set. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> Lord Grotrian." ...|$|R
60|$|JACK. I {{really am}} awfully sorry--my head's so jolly bad. <b>I</b> <b>'ve</b> <b>asked</b> the butler, {{but he has}} n't seen it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have heard}} nothing about your {{property}} {{but what you}} yourself <b>have</b> said unasked. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> no question about your property.' ...|$|R
60|$|Upon {{the hilt}} of his sword {{each of them}} swore to do as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked.</b>|$|E
60|$|What was I to do? <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> {{myself that}} {{question}} several times, and now I asked it again.|$|E
60|$|I felt quite uncomfortable--as if Mrs. Micawber {{supposed}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> her to {{do anything}} of the sort!--and sat looking at her in alarm.|$|E
60|$|Ger. Hail, fathers. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> {{permission}} of the prior to minister your refection, and bring you thereby the first news of the pageant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why are you evading?" [...] she asked. [...] "I am {{sure it is}} {{not because}} you have not settled convictions. And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> you--a favour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why didn't {{you tell}} me, dear?' Alice still sleepily whispered. 'Would <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> a single question? How could I? Oh, {{if you had}} only trusted me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is weary work. Would <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> you {{to bring}} that new tale of yours, Scribe Ana, {{that we might have}} read it together." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{remembered the}} answer {{of the old}} {{housekeeper}} at the parsonage, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> to see the clergyman. [...] "This, then, was his father's residence?" ...|$|E
60|$|There was a stillness {{about her}} then, {{a light on}} her face, which brought to my mind thought of Sally when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> her to marry me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Art thou mocking thy master, Gino? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> thee if {{thou art}} {{acquainted with the}} person of a certain Jacopo Frontoni, a dweller here in Venice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do like her,--I {{love her}} {{better than any}} one in the world; better even than you, Mary; for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> her to be my wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be frank, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> {{myself the}} question, and couldn't be quite {{sure it was}} {{altogether}} because {{she wanted me to}} get this unfortunate steamboat off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't in {{the least}} mind your {{laughing}} at me. I should have minded it very much if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> you to marry me, and you had refused me." ...|$|E
60|$|Martin gave in handsomely, I'll admit, and I am {{confident}} that at that moment, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> permission to pull one of his teeth, {{he would not have}} denied me.|$|E
60|$|Now {{just before}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> for the rifle I had {{perceived}} a little klipspringer antelope {{standing on a}} mass of rock about seventy yards away, and determined to risk the shot.|$|E
5000|$|Hayward {{also said}} of his brother Adry, [...] "He has done me no wrong. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done him a great {{injustice}} and wrong, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> for his forgiveness and received it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} so happy {{that she should be}} there; but what am I to do, Frank, if she refuses? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> her, and she has refused." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{would think}} the fellow lived next door," [...] Ricardo growled impatiently. [...] "Hang it all, can't you {{understand}} a plain question? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> you the way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} may--if {{you are really}} {{convinced}} {{that he wants to}} hear it," [...] she said at last, as if barely recollecting that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> the question two minutes previously.|$|E
60|$|He {{shrugged his}} shoulders, as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> {{what he would}} do in an {{earthquake}} with two rows of New York skyscrapers falling on his head from both sides of a street.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the reply}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> for; {{but it was}} not {{explicit}} enough, now I had got it, to satisfy me. I felt the necessity of leading him (if possible) into details.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> him {{to forgive}} me since,' cried Bella; 'and I would ask him {{to forgive me}} now again, upon my knees, if it would spare him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you will," [...] Sabatini agreed. [...] "Perhaps Mr. Chetwode {{will be so}} kind as to {{take you}} back? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> a friend to call here this evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not {{mischief}} at all, Gerald. The Antelope came in last night, and I saw Captain Lockett this morning, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> {{him to come}} to supper." ...|$|R
