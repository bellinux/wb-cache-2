Following the vandalism, the severed trunk was stored, and it was eventually decided to re-attach it with artificial supports, several steel straps connecting the trunk to the base; this work {{was carried out in}} early July 2015 at a cost of €35,000, shared by the Catalan government and the Barcelona provincial administration.|$|E
5|$|Mustaine {{has made}} {{numerous}} inflammatory {{statements in the}} press, usually regarding issues with former Metallica bandmates. The feud stemmed from his ejection from the band, how it was conducted, and disagreements on songwriting credits. Mustaine expressed his anger in the movie Some Kind of Monster, in a scene he later disapproved of as {{he felt he was}} mischaracterized, and that it did not represent the full extent of what <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> meeting.|$|E
5|$|A second {{mandatory}} {{roll call}} {{took place in}} the evening. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> day, before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. The prisoners slept in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen.|$|E

5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 31,000 tickets. Cardiff fans would be {{housed in the}} East End of the stadium, while Liverpool fans were allocated the West End of the stadium. Ticket prices were increased from last year's final, with the most expensive tickets costing £90 up £4 from the previous year. The least expensive tickets cost £40, which was £2 more than last year. It was decided that before the match started national anthems would not be played. This {{decision was made to}} avoid spectators jeering the anthems, as <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2008 FA Cup Final between Portsmouth and Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|A {{close link}} {{existed between the}} ruler and the Sangha (Buddhist priesthood) since the {{introduction}} of Buddhism to the country. This relationship was further strengthened during Dutthagamani's reign. The monks often advised and even guided the king on decisions. This association was initially with the Mahavihara sect, but {{by the middle of}} the 1st century BC, the Abhayagiri sect had also begun to have a close link to the ruling of the country. By the end of the 3rd century AD, the Jetavana sect had also become close to the ruler. Estrangements between the ruler and the priesthood often weakened the government, as <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> reign of Lanjatissa. Even Valagamba's resistance movement was initially hampered because of a rift with the Mahavihara, and he succeeded only after a reconciliation was affected. Some rulers patronized only one sect, but this often led to unrest in the country and most rulers equally supported all sects. Despite this, religious establishments were often plundered during times of internal strife by the rulers themselves, such as during the reigns of Dathopatissa I (639–650) and Kashyapa II (650–659).|$|E
5|$|As had <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Kokoda Track {{campaign}} and the Battle of Buna–Gona, estimates by Australian intelligence differed greatly from those at GHQ, as they used different methods. The intelligence staff at Blamey's Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ), headed by Brigadier J. D. Rogers, {{had come up with}} a much higher figure of 3,000. I Corps produced an estimate of 1,800, which was passed on along with GHQ's estimate. The Allies' best source of intelligence, Ultra, shone no light on the matter. Finschhafen was mentioned in only five decrypted messages in the previous three months. Most of these were in the insecure Japanese Water Transport Code. Only after the capture of Japanese codebooks in the Battle of Sio in January 1944 were the Allies able to systematically break into the Japanese Army codes. In fact, Japanese strength in the area on 22 September was about 5,000.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, Chappell toured South Africa with Richie Benaud's International Wanderers team, {{released}} his autobiography Chappelli {{and was named}} as one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. He was hired to spend the summer of 1976–77 as a guest professional in the Melbourne district competition where he was paid {{more than he had}} been as Australian captain. During the season, he was involved in a famous altercation with a young English all-rounder who was in Victoria on a cricketing scholarship, Ian Botham. Both men have put forward vastly different versions as to what <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> physical confrontation in a Melbourne pub. The animosity between them continues and Channel Nine used it as a marketing ploy when Botham temporarily partnered Chappell as a television commentator during the 1998–99 season. Botham again revived the feud in his 2007 autobiography with another version of the incident.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, early {{reports from}} the 1908 Messina {{earthquake}} and World War I on kidney failure after injury were followed by studies by London physicians Eric Bywaters and Desmond Beall, working at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the National Institute for Medical Research, on four victims of The Blitz in 1941. Myoglobin was demonstrated in the urine of victims by spectroscopy, and {{it was noted that}} the kidneys of victims resembled those of patients who had hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin rather than myoglobin being the cause of the kidney damage). In 1944 Bywaters demonstrated experimentally that the kidney failure was mainly caused by myoglobin. Already during the war, teams of doctors traveled to bombed areas to provide medical support, chiefly with intravenous fluids, as dialysis was not yet available. The prognosis of acute kidney failure improved markedly when dialysis was added to supportive treatment, which first <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1950–1953 Korean War.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September, IV Corps began {{operations}} {{designed to}} capture Bancourt Ridge {{and allow the}} advance to continue. Under the cover of an artillery barrage, the 42nd Division, New Zealand Division, and 5th Division, {{from right to left}} respectively, would begin advancing at 4:55 am. As had frequently <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> battle, the New Zealanders found themselves ahead of the flanking divisions. The New Zealand Rifle Brigade swiftly made the crest of the ridge, taking 70 prisoners. The 1st Infantry Brigade was a little slower; the 1st Wellington Battalion made the crest and consolidated itself there. The other battalion, 2nd Auckland, despite the assistance of two tanks, was unable to do the same. Operating on the extreme flank of the New Zealand Division's sector of the front, it suffered the most from the lack of progress of the 42nd Division and was unable hold its portion of the crest. That evening, the 2nd Infantry Brigade moved into the line, replacing both the New Zealand Rifle Brigade and 1st Infantry Brigade.|$|E

5|$|Teams only {{averaged}} around 80 {{points per}} game {{in the years following}} the founding of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1946. Before the introduction of the shot clock, teams often ran out the clock by passing the ball more frequently after they established a lead in a game. If one team chose to stall, the other team (especially if behind) would often commit fouls to regain possession. This resulted in very low-scoring games with many fouls, affecting attendance by making fans irritable. Starting in the 1954–55 season, the NBA implemented a 24-second shot clock. If the offensive team fails to hit the rim with the ball within the allotted time, they would lose possession. This innovation resulted in much higher scoring games. All of the highest-scoring games in the NBA have <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> shot-clock era.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{nominated}} for six Black Reel Awards, winning only Best Actress for Palmer. Out of five NAACP Image Awards nominations, Akeelah and the Bee won Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture and Outstanding Writing in a Feature Film/Television Movie - Comedy or Drama. At the Black Movie Awards, it won the five awards it {{was nominated for}}. The same <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Young Artist Awards where it was nominated for two categories and won two awards, and at the CAMIE Awards where it was nominated for and won an award. The film was also nominated for but did not win any award from the BET Awards, Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, Chicago Film Critics, and Satellite Awards. National Board of Review elected it among the best ten independent films produced in 2006. Additionally, two film critics, Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun and Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer, added the film on their list of the ten best films of the year. St. Petersburg Timess Steve Persall elected it the best family film of 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{first wave}} of forced {{conversions}} in the Crown of Aragon <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Revolt of the Brotherhoods. Rebellion bearing an anti-Muslim sentiment broke out among the Christian subjects of Valencia in the early 1520s, and those active in it forced Muslims to become Christians in the territories they controlled. Muslims joined the Crown in suppressing the rebellion, playing crucial roles in several battles. After the rebellion was suppressed, the Muslims regarded the conversions forced by the rebels as invalid and returned to their faith. Subsequently, King Charles I (also known as Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire) started an investigation to determine {{the validity of the}} conversions. The commission tasked with this investigation started working in November 1524. Charles ultimately upheld the conversions, putting the forcibly converted subjects under the authority of the Inquisition. Supporters of this decision argued that the Muslims had a choice when confronted by the rebels: they could have chosen to refuse and die, but did not, indicating that the conversions happened out of free will and must remain in effect.|$|E
25|$|Precipitation in Gaborone is scanty and erratic. Most of the {{rainfall}} in Gaborone falls <b>during</b> <b>the</b> summer months, between October and April.

Gaborone has been affected by three floods based on records going back to 1995, one in 2000, one in 2001 that caused an estimated 5,000,000 Botswana pula worth of damage, and one in 2006.|$|R

5|$|The {{main focus}} of the Exchequer was the {{collection}} of royal revenue {{as part of the}} greater Exchequer, which was officially undertaken by the Lord High Treasurer. The Exchequer was unique in having jurisdiction in matters of both equity and the common law, the latter initially curtailed after the Magna Carta and reserved for the Court of King's Bench and Court of Common Pleas, although it later grew back. This process of common law and equity was reversed; during the 16th century the Exchequer was solely a common law body, with the equity jurisdiction only again becoming relevant {{near the end of the}} Tudor period. W. H. Bryson argues that this <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> reign of Edward I. By 1590 the Exchequer's jurisdiction over equity cases was confirmed, and it was handling a significant number a year, including disputes over trusts, mortgages, tithes and copyholds; since taxation was ever-present, it was not difficult to show that the dispute prevented the payment of a debt to the monarch, allowing the Writ of Quominus.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} change that <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> growth of Limusaurus is the {{complete}} loss of teeth from juveniles to adults. Juveniles began with one tooth in the premaxilla, {{eight in the}} maxilla, and eleven in the lower jaw (42 teeth total). At the next stage, the first, sixth, and eighth teeth in the maxilla, as well as the sixth in the lower jaw have all been lost (34 teeth total), although the sockets are still present, and there is a small replacement tooth in the socket of the sixth lower tooth. During this stage, usage of teeth and normal tooth replacement likely ceased or became reduced, since none of the still-erupted teeth bear any marks of wear or resorption. As the specimens grew, the transformation became more radical. In subadult and adult specimens older than one year in age, all of the teeth are missing. CT scanning shows that only five empty tooth sockets remain in the adult maxilla; all of the sockets in the lower jaw have fused into a single, hollow canal, {{and the rest of the}} tooth sockets have been obliterated.|$|E
5|$|Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a {{powerful}} tool for studying the formation of the Solar System. The iodine–xenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula. In 1960, physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly {{in the form of an}} overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine-129. This isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. Because the half-life of 129I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale (16 million years), this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> early history of the Solar System, because the 129I isotope was likely generated shortly before the Solar System was formed, seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.|$|E
