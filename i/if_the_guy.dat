Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager Leo Durocher informed the team, [...] "I do not care <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra.

2500|$|Things {{would improve}} slowly. Banter between O'Brien and Richter improved, and {{sketches}} grew in popularity ("If They Mated", [...] "Desk Drive", [...] "In the Year 2000"). A reliable staple involved a TV screen, lowered behind O'Brien's desk and displaying a still photo of news figure. The lips and voice of these characters – frequently a party-crazed hillbilly interpretation of Bill Clinton – were supplied by writing partner Robert Smigel. A turning point was David Letterman's February 1994 appearance. [...] "It was a morale boost," [...] said O'Brien. [...] "I'm thinking, <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> {{who created the}} 12:30 thing comes on and says we're smart and funny, let's go." [...] The show went through a temporary wobble in January 1995 when Robert Smigel, feeling burned out, quit as head writer. The show's quality improved slowly over time, and most credit O'Brien's growing comedic performance. Within a year, a comedic formula began to arise: the show would combine the lewd and wacky with a more elegant, narrative-driven remotes. Regular characters would typically include a [...] "Masturbating Bear" [...] and a famous remote found Conan visit a historic, Civil War-era baseball league. That piece was one of O'Brien's personal favorites, later remarking, [...] "When I leave this earth, at the funeral, just show this, because this pretty much says who I'm all about." ...|$|E

[...] On its story told on the song of a man trying to seduce a girl over the phone, Billy Dukes of Taste of Country called it [...] "wonderful selfishness" [...] and praised its [...] "refreshing boldness". In a more critical review, Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song a [...] "D" [...] grade, saying that there are [...] "Two ways to hear song: One, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> is right, then it’s a mediocre love song about that moment when two people decide to get into a relationship.

5000|$|Several times, {{one side}} neared victory before {{circumstances}} changed.

He recalled that, [...] "I didn't know <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> on <b>the</b> team wanted to hug me or slug me." [...] The weather was so cold that players burned broken bats and the stadium's wooden benches to warm themselves, and the clubhouses ran out of food. The wind blew into the infield, making hits difficult; Pawtucket's Dave Koza later claimed that otherwise his team would have won in nine innings, with [...] "four or five shots that would have been out of the park". For example, Sam Bowen hit a fly ball to center that reportedly left the field before the wind blew it back to Rochester outfielder Dallas Williams. Williams went 0-for-13 in 15 plate appearances, one of many records achieved during the game.|$|R

50|$|For {{a spouse}} {{to be chosen}} it takes {{a very long time}} {{and there are a lot}} of procedures. First, the groom’s family goes to another {{community}} and finds a girl with a good background and personality. If the groom has a bad reputation, he goes very far to find a bride. Then the bride’s family usually decides to go to the groom's village and find out information about the groom's family, to learn about their status in the community. If the family of the bride agrees, they are officially married. The girl would normally say yes to show respect. In the old days, the girl does not have a say in who she wants to marry. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> was rich, he could have any girl he wanted. If she resists, she is kidnapped by the husband.
