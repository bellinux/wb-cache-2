5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{well-established}} writing system for ASL, written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language {{seems to be that}} of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written sign language remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of <b>facial</b> <b>expression,</b> and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles.|$|E

40|$|Emotional <b>facial</b> <b>expressions</b> are {{indispensable}} communicative tools, {{and social}} interactions involving <b>facial</b> <b>expressions</b> are impaired in some psychiatric disorders. Recent studies {{revealed that the}} perception of dynamic <b>facial</b> <b>expressions</b> was exaggerated in normal participants, and this exaggerated perception is weakened in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Based {{on the notion that}} ASD and schizophrenia spectrum disorder are at two extremes of the continuum with respect to social impairment, we hypothesized that schizophrenic characteristics would strengthen the exaggerated perception of dynamic <b>facial</b> <b>expressions.</b> To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between the perception of <b>facial</b> <b>expressions</b> and schizotypal traits in a normal population. We presented dynamic and static <b>facial</b> <b>expressions,</b> and asked participants to change an emotional face display to match the perceived final image. The presence of schizotypal traits was positively correlated with the degree of exaggeration for dynamic, as well as static, <b>facial</b> <b>expressions.</b> Among its subscales, the paranoia trait was positively correlated with the exaggerated perception of <b>facial</b> <b>expressions.</b> These results suggest that schizotypal traits, specifically the tendency to over-attribute mental states to others, exaggerate the perception of emotional <b>facial</b> <b>expressions...</b>|$|R

When the rabbits are depicted, they are viewed in the middle distance in order to include all six as well as the garden background. They are depicted with little or no <b>facial</b> <b>expression.</b> It is likely Potter (a farm owner at the date of the book's composition) had come to view rabbits as undifferentiated pests rather than individual personalities. Several drawings for the illustrations for The Flopsy Bunnies were given to the British Museum in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of <b>facial</b> <b>expression</b> on one or both sides of the face.|$|E

5|$|Unaided AAC {{systems are}} {{those that do not}} require an {{external}} tool, and include <b>facial</b> <b>expression,</b> vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages and systems. Informal vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication, and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities. More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For example, the Amer-Ind code is based on Plains Indian Sign Language, and has been used with children with severe-profound disabilities, and adults with a variety of diagnoses including dementia, aphasia and dysarthria. The benefits of gestures and pantomime are that they are always available to the user, usually understood by an educated listener, and are efficient means of communicating.|$|E
5|$|Alan Pattillo, a {{longtime}} scriptwriter and director for APF, was appointed the company's first official script editor in late 1964. This move was aimed {{to reduce the}} burden on Gerry Anderson who, while reserving his producer's right to overall creative control, had grown weary of revising scripts himself. Direction of episodes was assigned in pairs: veterans Pattillo and David Elliott alternated with the less-experienced Desmond Saunders and newcomer David Lane for each month's filming. Due to the difficulties of setting up takes, progress was slow: even on a productive day, it was rare for the crew to complete more than two minutes of puppet footage. In a contemporary interview, Hill noted that Thunderbirds contained several times as many shots as a typical live-action series.

His <b>facial</b> <b>expression</b> is of anger, conviction of something he must do, {{and one in the}} middle of action. The legs and five of the eight arms are broken, attributed to Portuguese vandalism. The smaller broken image Andhaka is seen below Bhairava's image. Also depicted in his right hand is the symbolic weapon that Shaiva mythology states Shiva used to kill the destructive elephant demon. A hand holds a bowl to collect the blood dripping from the slain Andhaka, which Shaiva legend states was necessary because the dripping blood had the power to become new demons if they got nourished by the ground. Furthermore, the artwork shows ruined parts of a male and two female forms, figures of two ascetics, a small figure in front, a female figure, and two dwarfs. The uppermost part shows flying apsaras bringing garlands.|$|E

5|$|The most {{characteristic}} initial {{physical symptoms}} are jerky, random, and uncontrollable movements called chorea. Chorea may be initially exhibited as general restlessness, small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions, lack of coordination, or slowed saccadic eye movements. These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction {{by at least}} three years. The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity, writhing motions or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses. These are signs that the system in the brain {{that is responsible for}} movement has been affected. Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired, such that any action that requires muscle control is affected. Common consequences are physical instability, abnormal <b>facial</b> <b>expression,</b> and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and may lead to malnutrition. Sleep disturbances are also associated symptoms. Juvenile HD differs from these symptoms in that it generally progresses faster and chorea is exhibited briefly, if at all, with rigidity being the dominant symptom. Seizures are also a common symptom of this form of HD.|$|E

40|$|Non-human {{primates}} use various communicative {{means in}} interactions with others. While primate gestures are commonly {{considered to be}} intentionally and flexibly used signals, <b>facial</b> <b>expressions</b> are {{often referred to as}} inflexible, automatic expressions of affective internal states. To explore whether and how non-human primates use <b>facial</b> <b>expressions</b> in specific communicative interactions, we studied five species of small apes (gibbons) by employing a newly established Facial Action Coding System for hylobatid species (GibbonFACS). We found that, despite individuals often being in close proximity to each other, in social (as opposed to non-social contexts) the duration of <b>facial</b> <b>expressions</b> was significantly longer when gibbons were facing another individual compared to non-facing situations. Social contexts included grooming, agonistic interactions and play, whereas non-social contexts included resting and self-grooming. Additionally, gibbons used <b>facial</b> <b>expressions</b> while facing another individual more often in social contexts than non-social contexts where <b>facial</b> <b>expressions</b> were produced regardless of the attentional state of the partner. Also, <b>facial</b> <b>expressions</b> were more likely 'responded to' by the partner's <b>facial</b> <b>expressions</b> when facing another individual than non-facing. Taken together, our results indicate that gibbons use their <b>facial</b> <b>expressions</b> differentially depending on the social context and are able to use them in a directed way in communicative interactions with other conspecifics...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present our Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) capable of {{displaying}} a vast set of <b>facial</b> <b>expressions</b> to communicate its emotional {{states as well}} as its social relations.
