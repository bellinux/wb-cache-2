40|$|The {{design of}} {{pharmaceutical}} products, packaging, information and related materials {{is a major}} source of human error. These errors may be stressful, harmful or even fatal. Given the scale of the problems and the global use of medication, design solutions are urgently needed. This paper in Applied Ergonomics demonstrated how such improvements can be made, drawing on research that investigated how the design of methotrexate packaging can influence patient safety. The project, undertaken in light of a number of serious incidents in the UK resulting from accidental overdoses of methotrexate, aimed to collect evidence to provide a basis for the development of new concepts for revised designs by the pharmaceutical industry. Buckle et al. found that patients using methotrexate experience a number of <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> <b>using</b> their <b>medicine’s</b> packaging and, as a result, resourcefully adopt a variety of ‘coping strategies’ which may increase the risk of dosing errors. By investigating both the practices of methotrexate users, and the design of the system that supports methotrexate use, additional problems were observed across the healthcare system, meaning that the function of medicines packaging in ensuring safety may be even more critical than first suspected. Buckle contributed to this paper through the derivation of a suitable human-factors approach to studying fatalities, errors and ‘near misses’ {{associated with the use of}} packaging for medications. The human factors (human behaviour) associated with these and the need to consider the whole system were essential elements provided by Buckle in the research. As a result of the research project, the National Patient Safety Agency responded with a UK-wide programme of work to improve safety for patients, and continues to work with the pharmaceutical industry to develop more user-friendly packaging and labelling...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{characterize}} the <b>use</b> of <b>medicines</b> by patients {{of the primary}} health care of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). METHODS This is a cross-sectional, exploratory, and descriptive study, part of the Pesquisa Nacional sobre Acesso, Utilização e Promoção do Uso Racional de Medicamentos – Serviços, 2015 (PNAUM – National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational <b>Use</b> of <b>Medicines</b> – Services, 2015). Interviews were carried out with patients present in the services by semi-structured questionnaires. Sociodemographic, clinical, and <b>use</b> of <b>medicines</b> variables were assessed and the <b>use</b> of <b>medicines</b> <b>in</b> the 30 days prior to the interview was also verified. The population was stratified into three age groups: 18 to 44, 45 to 64, and 65 years or more. The differences between the age groups were verified using the Student’s t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test for the categorical ones. The complex samples analysis plan was employed. The medicines were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System. RESULTS Of the 8, 803 patients interviewed, 6, 511 (76. 2 %) reported to have <b>used</b> <b>medicines</b> <b>in</b> the 30 days prior to the interview. On average, each patient <b>used</b> 2. 32 <b>medicines,</b> without difference between the sexes. Among medicine users, 18. 2 % were aged 65 years or more. Compared to the other age groups, older adults presented more comorbidities, <b>used</b> more <b>medicines,</b> and self-reported worse health conditions. They were also less educated, reported worse economic situation, and lived alone. The medicines that were mostly used were “other analgesics and antipyretics” (3 rd ATC level) and Losartan (5 th ATC level). CONCLUSIONS Most medicine users had lower education level and presented comorbidities. The most <b>used</b> <b>medicines</b> were the antihypertensive ones. Self-medication was higher among young people. Most patients reported to <b>use</b> generic <b>medicines.</b> The average number of medicines and the prevalence of use increased with age. Due to the characteristics observed and the <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> the <b>use</b> of <b>medicines,</b> older adults are {{in a situation of}} greater vulnerability...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{technology}} is increasing {{and most of}} the population uses a variety of simple and complex everyday technology at home and society. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe relevance and <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> of everyday technology in daily activities in individual´s aged 45 - 64 years. The study was designed quantitatively. The survey group comprised of 40 persons living in either countryside or large town. Data was conducted with the standardized assessment instrument Everyday Use Technology Questionnaire (ETUQ II). Data was analyzed in a computer software program and was presented with descriptive statistics. The result showed that there are differences in the relevance and <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> the <b>use</b> of everyday technology in individuals from countryside and large town. Differences in the relevance were found within the areas of household activities, activities in the home, power tools and work. <b>Difficulties</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> of everyday technology were found within the areas activities in the home, power tools, telecommunication and work. In conclusion, the study indicates that the relevance and <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> the <b>use</b> of everyday technology can be influenced where individual´s live. Everyday technology is relevant to individual's daily activities and occupational therapists need to pay attention to the factors that may affect the difficulty of use.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} and describe the characteristics of the <b>difficulties</b> <b>using</b> everyday technology <b>in</b> persons with an aquired brain injury (ABI), and their experiences of how these difficulties influenced their life. Thirteen persons with an ABI were interviewed about their <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> <b>using</b> everyday technology and were observed <b>in</b> their <b>use</b> of technology. Data were analysed qualitatively with a constant comparative method. The results showed that the persons' experiences formed two categories: "A variety of combinations of <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> the <b>use</b> of everyday technology" and "Restrictions <b>in</b> life". The <b>difficulties</b> identified were related not only to everyday technology itself but also to the interaction between the technology, the task, the person, and the environment. These difficulties influenced their experiences of restrictions in occupational performance, personal identification, and participation in society. The results emphasize that occupational therapists who design interventions for people with an ABI need to accommodate both the technology and other interacting aspects in order to overcome <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> <b>using</b> everyday technology...|$|R
