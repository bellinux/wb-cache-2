40|$|Results from {{a series}} of {{experiments}} to investigate whether centrifugal compressor stability could be improved by injecting air through the diffuser hub surface are reported. The research was conducted in a 4 : 1 pressure ratio centrifugal compressor configured with a vane-island diffuser. Injector nozzles were located just upstream of {{the leading edge of the}} diffuser vanes. Nozzle orientations were set to produce injected streams angled at 8, 0 and + 8 degrees relative to the vane mean camber line. Several injection flow rates were tested using both an external air supply and recirculation from the diffuser exit. Compressor flow range did not improve at any injection flow rate that was tested. Compressor flow range did improve slightly at zero injection due to the flow resistance created by injector openings on the hub surface. Leading edge loading and semi-vaneless space diffusion showed trends similar to those reported earlier from shroud surface experiments that did improve compressor flow range. Opposite trends are seen for <b>hub</b> <b>injection</b> cases where compressor flow range decreased. The <b>hub</b> <b>injection</b> data further explain the range improvement provided by shroud-side injection and suggest that different hub-side techniques may produce range improvement in centrifugal compressors...|$|E
40|$|Downstream of {{a modern}} {{combined}} cycle gas turbine there is generally an abrupt end of the turbine inner hub wall leading to a backward facing step with separation and flow recircula-tion on the hub axis. This {{can lead to a}} strong hub wake with high losses {{in the center of the}} diffuser. The interaction between the end of the hub and the downstream axial diffuser can have a significant influence on diffuser flow field and hence on overall gas turbine performance. To minimize the hub wake the flow can be guided to the axis by reducing the diameter of the hub. But this can still lead to separation on the extended hub and to a strong hub wake. This paper describes experimental and numer-ical investigations of the use of flow injection to control the flow separation on the hub and to guide the main flow towards the axis of the diffuser to reduce the hub wake. A new test rig has been built at the Institute of Thermal Turbomachinery and Machinery Laboratory of the University of Stuttgart, Germany (ITSM). This rig features an active flow control device based on hub flow injection with a Coanda-effect to influence the hub wake flow. In addition to experi-mental studies, steady CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations have been performed for this configuration and validated using the experimental data. Test results and flow field computations confirm that the flow control device tested can have a beneficial influence on diffuser performance at specific conditions. If it is the casing flow which separates then <b>hub</b> <b>injection</b> has little effect. If the casing flow is attached, and a hub separation limits the perfor-mance, then hub jet flow injection can be highly beneficial. The results also indicate that the mass flow injected in the hub jet control device has to be carefully balanced...|$|E
40|$|To prevent {{unnecessary}} IV peripheral cannulation. To improve {{techniques for}} {{those patients who}} do require this procedure and ultimately reduce cannulation related infections. To ensure a consistently high standard of practice across the organisation. BACKGROUND Peripheral intravenous cannula insertion is a commonly performed procedure and has an associated risk of infection {{because of the potential}} for direct microbial entry into the bloodstream. Intravenous cannulae may be contaminated by the patient’s skin flora at the insertion site, or by the introduction of other organisms via the cannula <b>hub</b> or <b>injection</b> port. An Australian study 2 showed a bacteraemia rate of 1 per 3000 cannulae, and more recently an infection rate of 0. 2 per 1000 intravenous cannulae has been demonstrated. 3 Shaving the skin prior to cannulation is not recommended as the need to remove hair has not been substantiated by scientific evidence. If hair removal is necessary it should be done with clippers. KEY POINTS 1. Only Health Care Professionals (HCP) who have attended a theoretical course recognised b...|$|R
40|$|The {{provision}} of patent venous access while {{reducing the risk}} of infection associated with peripheral venous access devices. BACKGROUND Peripheral intravenous cannula insertion is a commonly performed procedure and has an associated risk of infection because of the potential for direct microbial entry into the blood stream. Intravenous cannulae may be contaminated by the patient’s skin flora at the insertion site or by the introduction of other organisms via the cannula <b>hub</b> or <b>injection</b> port. An Australian study showed a bacteraemia rate of 1 : 3, 000 cannulae and more recently an infection rate of 0. 2 : 1000 intravenous cannula days has been demonstrated 1 Bandages and other devices which do not allow for visualisation of the cannula site, or create a tourniquet around the cannula are not appropriate. The flushing of a catheter that is not being used is controversial and there are no studies that have demonstrated the most effective frequency. In a hospital setting, the frequency is usually every 8 - 12 hours. KEY POINT...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the first}} {{description}} in 1982, totally implanted venous access ports have progressively improved patients' {{quality of life}} and medical assistance when a medical condition requires the use of long-term venous access. Currently, {{they are part of the}} standard medical care for oncohematologic patients.
