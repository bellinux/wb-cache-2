He remarked that he had not [...] "seriously consider [...] until about five or six weeks" [...] prior to his official announcement. When asked about the [...] "spoiler effect", he stated that [...] "the votes [...] are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> people that are committed to voting for McCain." [...] Also during the interview, Barr articulated that his campaign would make use of the internet with methods similar to those employed by Ron Paul and Barack Obama to mobilize young voters. Barr attempted to tap into Ron Paul's resources and supporters to raise funds, and used the same company that Paul used, Terra Eclipse, to design his campaign website. Stephen P. Gordon, who worked for Paul, was hired as the e-Campaign manager, and Doug Bandow, who previously worked as an advisor for both Ron Paul and Ronald Reagan, was hired as the Senior Policy Advisor.|$|E

In his concession speech, Bevin opined [...] "there is zero {{chance that the}} solutions for what ails us is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the Democratic Party", but did not endorse McConnell. He appeared onstage with McConnell on a few occasions during the general election campaign but steadfastly refused to explicitly endorse him. During his remarks at an October 29 Restore America rally, Bevin said [...] "I say {{with all due respect}} to a lot of folks who might say otherwise, sometimes we might need to get over it and move on. We have new races to run and new decisions to make. There is too much at stake." [...] Asked if the comment amounted to an endorsement of McConnell, Bevin told reporters, [...] "You've got ears." [...] McConnell defeated Grimes in the general election, and Bevin eventually told reporters that he voted for McConnell.|$|E

40|$|Boron {{neutron capture}} therapy (BNCT) is a bimodal form of {{radiation}} therapy for cancer. The first component of this treatment is the preferential localization of the stable isotope {sup 10 }B in tumor cells by targeting with boronated compounds. The tumor and surrounding tissue is then irradiated with a neutron beam {{resulting in the}}rmal neutron/{sup 10 }B reactions ({sup 10 }B(n,{alpha}) {sup 7 }Li) resulting {{in the production of}} localized high LET radiation from alpha and {sup 7 }Li particles. These products of the neutron capture reaction are very damaging to cells, but of short range so {{that the majority of the}} ionizing energy released is microscopically confined to the vicinity of the boron-containing compound. In principal it should be possible with BNCT to selectively destroy small nests or even single cancer cells located within normal tissue. It follows that the major improvements in this form of radiation therapy are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> largely <b>from</b> the development of boron compounds with greater tumor selectivity, although there will certainly be advances made in neutron beam quality as well as the possible development of alternative sources of neutron beams, particularly accelerator-based epithermal neutron beams...|$|R

Lincoln University {{has been involved with}} this leaders programme since 1979 when it was launched with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, USA. Irrigation and water storage has long been touted as a potential for improvements in productivity in dryland East Coast areas. Reports date back to the 1880 's discussing the benefits water would bring to farmlands. Currently there is 750, 000 ha of land irrigated in New Zealand with approximately 400, 000 ha in Canterbury. The total irrigated area in New Zealand has trebled since 1985. There is currently another 400, 000 ha of scheme proposals at various levels of development. For growth in irrigated area to continue water is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> storage as in many areas aquifers and river water availability are fully allocated, thus forcing the need for storage. Agriculture currently contributes 56 % of New Zealand's total exports. For New Zealand to maintain and grow the country's standard of living we quite simply have to raise the bar on exports. We have to export more to also rectify our unsustainable balance of payments situation. Our exporting strengths lie in agriculture. The addition of storage to a proposed irrigation scheme in Canterbury covering 60, 000 ha would create an additional $ 700 million in export earnings per annum also creating an additional 1600 new jobs additional to that created by the irrigation alone...|$|R

[...] The instrument itself plays notoriously out of tune and trumpet players had to be converted over to the mellophonium, before June and July 1960 the horn was new and untested in a real, musical playing environment. [...] Two entire albums of material (sessions from Sept. 1960 and Feb. 1961) were left unreleased for over a decade due to the problems associated with recording mellophoniums. Kenton commented, [...] "The mellophonium is a peculiar instrument when you get in the upper register, you don't know what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out <b>from</b> the thing, and it's hard to control." [...] The kinks were worked out and the personnel of the Kenton orchestra persevered, Merry Christmas become both Billboard and Variety's top Christmas LP; both Kenton's West Side Story and Adventures In Jazz earned Grammys in 1962 and 1963 respectively.|$|R

Mrs Sappleton cannot understand why he has run away and, when her husband and her brothers come in, she tells them about the odd man who has just left. The niece explains that Framton Nuttel ran away because of the spaniel: he is afraid of dogs since he was hunted by a pack of stray dogs in India and had to spend a night in the newly dug grave with creatures grinning and foaming just above him.

40|$|T H E TREATMENT OF ALCOHOLISM has not {{improved}} in any important way in 25 years, and alcoholism {{is becoming more}} prevalent, not less. The systematic and long-term collection of data has just begun, but we know the main facts. Only a minority of patients who enter treatment are helped to long-term recovery; the majority {{is made up of}} those who relapse soon and often and those who are lost to follow-up. Can present methods of treatment catch up with the problem? Consider New York City. The annual budget for alcoholism treatment exceeds 10 million dollars, but probably no more than 5000 patients are helped each year to rehabilitation. To help these patients is humane and, perhaps, cost-effective; we do not deny expensive therapy to patients with more relentless dis-orders than alcoholism, for example, those with intestinal cancer or chronic renal disease. But there are at least 300 000 alcoholic persons in New York. Even if they all wanted treatment, the cost of treating them with cur-rent methods could not be met. No possible extension of present methods of treatment can radically cut down the current prevalence of alcoholism in New York and else-where in the United States. We have made progress. The public is increasingly con-cerned about alcoholism. It is getting the attention of the media. Government is committing funds for treatment and research. Physicians are beginning to see that treating the medical and surgical complications of alcoholism without treating the alcoholism is simply bad medicine. But physi-cians are concerned about high relapse rates. They do not see a well-defined role for the particular skills of the in-ternist. These concerns are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be dispelled only when we know much more than we know now about the pathophysiology of alcoholism. This knowledge is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> only <b>from</b> research, but only after we see what is alcoholism research and that which is intended to be alcoholism research but is not. Alcoholism is a disorder of human behavior. "The one common denominator of all alcoholics, whether rich o...|$|R
40|$|North Carolina, Texas, {{and other}} states with Republican legislatures have passed a series of laws {{making it harder for}} voters to {{register}} and to vote. In response, the United States Department of Justice has sued these states, claiming that the laws violate portions of the Voting Rights Act protecting minority voters. When party and race coincide as they did in 1900 and they do today, it is hard to separate racial and partisan intent and effect. Today, white voters in the South are overwhelmingly Republican and, in some of the Southern states, {{are less likely to be}} willing to vote for a Black candidate than are white voters in the rest of the country. The Democratic Party supports a left leaning platform that includes more social assistance to the poor and higher taxes. Some Republicans view such plans as aiding racial minorities. Given the overlap of considerations of race and considerations of party, when a Republican legislature like North Carolina’s passes a law making it harder for some voters to vote, is that a law about party politics or a law about race? As I explain, if courts call this a law about party politics and view it through the lens of partisan competition, then the law is more likely to stand, and the fight over it will be waged at the ballot box. If the courts call this a law about race and view it through the lens of the struggle over race and voting rights, then the law is more likely to fall and the fight will be settled primarily in the courts. The race versus party bifurcation is unhelpful, and the solution to these new battles over election rules — what I call 2 ̆ 2 The Voting Wars 2 ̆ 2 — is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the federal courts. Courts should apply a more rigorous standard to review arguably discriminatory voting laws. When a legislature passes an election administration law (outside the redistricting context) discriminating against a party’s voters or otherwise burdening voters, that fact should not be a defense. Instead, courts should read the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause to require the legislature to produce substantial evidence that it has a good reason for burdening voters and that its means are closely connected to achieving those ends. The achievement of partisan ends would not be considered a good reason (as it appears to be in the redistricting context). These rules will both discourage party power grabs and protect voting rights of minority voters. In short, this new rule will inhibit discrimination on the basis of both race and party, and protect all voters from unnecessary burdens on the right to vote...|$|R
