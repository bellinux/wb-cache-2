40|$|Increasingly {{there is}} a need for {{high-performance}} (sustainable) buildings. Even in a country with as little solar radiation as the Netherlands, the application of so-called solar energy roofs is becoming more popular. Already some different concepts exist, and one of the latest developments is the use of the roof as combined solar thermal collector and photovoltaic (PV) laminate. This chapter presents the results of research on the <b>energy</b> <b>roof</b> of a school in the Netherlands. The school was designed as an energy-plus school, and the <b>energy</b> <b>roof,</b> in combination with the PV laminate, plays a significant role in this project. The aim of this research was to determine the added value of the combined concept of PV and thermal collector in the total performance of the <b>energy</b> <b>roof.</b> It was expected that cooling of the PV laminate would have a positive effect on the electrical efficiency of this PV as the thermal collector absorbed heat from the overlying PV laminate. The producers of the PV laminate claim it has higher efficiencies. This claim was examined by studying the correlation of efficiency and the thermal gain of the roof in three different situations. The results showed no clear positive effect of the <b>energy</b> <b>roof</b> on the average efficiency of the PV laminate...|$|E

40|$|Kraven på att nybyggda bostäder ska vara energisnåla i driftskedet ökar hela tiden av flera anledningar. Dels vill brukarna hålla driftskostnaderna så låga som möjligt och dels är det miljöaspekten som spelar in. Men hur energisnål kan en villa egentligen göras och hur påverkas arkitekturen då den görs extremt energieffektiv? I den här rapporten utreds tio energieffektiva principer som kan användas för att göra en villa mer energisnål och energiproducerande. Alla tio principer har tillämpats i en villa som projekterats under arbetets gång. De tio principerna är: Husets utformning Konstruktion Isolerade skjutluckor Solceller Solavskärmning Energitak Uppvärmningssystem Vindkraftverk Vindskydd Medvetenhet och inredning Resultaten visar att villan kommer ge ett energiöverskott på cirka 6   000 kWh/år enligt enklare handberäkningar av husets energiförbrukning och den producerade energin. Arkitekturen blir tydligt påverkad av de energieffektiva principerna men huset är ändå fullt funktionellt. Att tillämpa tio energieffektiva principer i en villa kan vara svårt att försvara ekonomiskt då pay-off tiderna är långa på grund av höga investeringskostnader. Arbetet har utförts på KTH campus Haninge i samarbete med Sweco Architects AB. The {{demands on}} newly {{constructed}} buildings to be energy efficient in the operational stage are increasing {{all the time}} by many reasons. Partly because {{the people living in}} the house want to keep the operational costs as low as possible and partly because of the impact on the environment. But how energy efficient can a villa be made and how does it affect the architecture when it is made extremely energy efficient? In this essay ten energy efficient principles are investigated which {{can be used to make}} a villa more energy efficient and energy producing. All ten principles have been applied in one villa that has been designed during this project. The ten principles are: The design and shape of the house Construction Insulated sliding slots Solar panels Sun shading <b>Energy</b> <b>roof</b> Heating system Wind power turbine Wind protection Consciousness and interior design The results show that the villa will produce an overbalance of energy of about 6   000 kWh/year according to simpler calculations of the house´s energy consumption and the energy that it produces. The architecture is clearly affected by the energy efficient principles but the house is still fully functioning. Applying ten energy efficient principles in one villa can be hard to motivate economically because of long pay-off times caused by high investment costs.

Conventional solar radiation models based on costly Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are only adequate for existing buildings, not for future construction areas. In this paper, a pixel-based methodology is constructed for estimating solar <b>energy</b> potential over <b>roofs.</b> Buildings with flat roofs in a newly planned construction area are chosen as a case study. The solar radiation at a certain cell is mathematically formulated in the pixel unit, and its yields over a certain time period are calculated by considering multiple instantaneous solar irradiances and are visually presented by image processing. Significant spatial and temporal variations in solar radiation are measured. Within the study area, the maximum and minimum annual radiation yields are estimated at 4717. 72  MJ/m 2 /year and 342. 58  MJ/m 2 /year respectively. Radiation contour lines are then mapped for outlining installation ranges of various solar devices. For each apartment building, around 20 % of roof areas can obtain 4500  MJ/m 2 /year or more solar radiation yields. This study will benefit energy investors and urban planners in accurately predicting solar radiation potential and identifying regions with high radiation over building roofs. The results can be utilised in government policies and urban planning to raise awareness of the use of renewable energy sources...|$|R
40|$|Assessments of {{the energy}} {{performance}} of green roofs have traditionally been performed with experimental and modelling procedures. Experimental green <b>roof</b> <b>energy</b> studies have significant disadvantages (expensive, time-consuming, cannot be generalised, etc.).

40|$|The extreme {{sustainability}} {{in building}} {{can be considered}} as three different aspects: 1. The construction of the building. 2. The operation of the building during its lifetime 3. The building being torn down after service life. Under the assumption that not building is the best solution for sustainability, Point 1 can be easily dealt with by renovating existing buildings. This also brings the solution for point 3 : not tearing down buildings will eliminate pollution and waste disposal. These two solutions emphasize the need to focus on the most sustainable way of operating a building during its lifetime, reducing energy and water consumption and yet be a healthy place to live. A study of existing housing projects in the Netherlands that are now {{at the end of their}} service life reveals some significant issues. In general there is very limited thermal isolation or none at all, often only single pane windows and all spaces are generally small.

Especially dirty roofs may perform substantially worse than product labels indicate. Dirt from foot traffic may be minimized by specifying designated walkways or by limiting access to the roof. Steep sloped roofs have less of a problem with dirt accumulation because rainwater can more easily wash away dirt and debris. Some cool roof surfaces are “self-cleaning” which means they shed dirt more easily and may better retain their reflectance. Cleaning a cool roof can restore solar reflectance close to its installed condition. Always check with your roof manufacturer for the proper cleaning procedure, as some methods may damage your roof. While it is generally not cost effective to clean a roof just for the <b>energy</b> savings, <b>roof</b> cleaning can be integrated as one component of your roof’s routine maintenance program.
