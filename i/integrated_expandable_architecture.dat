Previous work was done on a small, electrically powered helicopter with some success, but the overall conclusion was that the vehicle was underpowered.

A requirement of the effort is to develop codes on modern, <b>expandable</b> <b>architectures,</b> with flexibility to explore and evaluate a wide range of process options. During FY 09, efforts at ORNL have been focused on two priority tasks toward achieving the IPSC goal: (1) a top-down exploration of architecture - Subtask 1 : Explore framework for code development and integration for plant-level simulation; and (2) a bottom-up fundamental modeling effort - Subtask 2 : Development of molecular-level agent design code. Subtask 1 is important because definition and development of architecture is a key issue for the overall effort, as selection of an overall approach and code/data requirements is a necessary first step in the organization, design and development of separations and safeguards codes that will be incorporated. The agent design effort of Subtask 2 is a molecular-level modeling effort that has a direct impact on a near-term issue of the Separations and Waste Forms Campaign.

" This approach {{is based on the}} industry standard VMEbus and makes use of multiple commercial and custom VLSI hardware based cards to provide standard off-the-shelf telemetry processing functions (e. g., frame synchronization, packet processing, etc.) for many telemetry data handling applications. To maintain maximum flexibility and performance of these systems, a special real-time system environment has been developed, the Modular Environment for Data Systems (MEDS).

40|$|In March 2011, {{a devastating}} {{earthquake}} and tsunami struck northern Japan. In {{addition to the}} lives lost, {{thousands of people were}} dislocated, resulting in an urgent need for housing. My approach is to design the Expandable House, which is lightweight, easy to transport, quickly assembled, and sustainable. In a typical disaster relief timeline, three types of housing are provided. The first response to post-disaster housing is the assembly of lightweight emergency tents in relief camps, but these tents lack privacy, stability, and living conditions like insulation, heating, and ventilation. Therefore these tents are often replaced by temporary shelters such as trailers, shacks, and prefabricated houses, while the permanent housing is being constructed. However, these temporary structures double the cost of the overall solution because of the building materials and labor involved in building and deconstructing the temporary structures and rebuilding a new house. This thesis proposes to merge these different stages of housing into one through designing an <b>expandable</b> <b>architecture.</b> The house could be easily transported and deployed for disaster relief, and could be folded and transported again to be reused for a permanent house afterwards. Compared with other existing prefab housing systems, the scissor mechanism allows occupancy of the house during the expansion and contraction processes because the structure remains intact while it is being transformed. The ability to fold a house allows for flexible use of the site and space in a variety of urban settings. The flexibility provides opportunities to operate the house in different climate conditions while providing multiple options for day lighting, insulation, and ventilation. By using an aluminum scissor structure and fabric-laminated foam insulation, the project explores new materials and fabrication technology for a flexible architecture. by Mimi Ho Chu. Thesis (M.

Facilitated accessibility, safe operation and expandability are essentials {{at the root of the}} design and implementation of the Shake Table WebLab. The fully functional system allows students and researchers to excite a two-story structure, which is three feet high, by vibrating its base while receiving accelerometer readings from its three levels. Registered Internet users may upload their own input data, such as the seismic ground acceleration of a newly occurring earthquake, and therefore study the corresponding behavior of a real structure. The system is designed with an <b>expandable</b> <b>architecture</b> which enables future researchers to add functionalities that suit their fields of interest. Relevant fields of study include real-time signal processing and filtering techniques that would provide an understanding of how earthquakes affect a structure and therefore provide insight on means to minimize encountered damage in large-scale structures. An already developed tool utilizes frequency domain transfer functions to compare the measured structural response at the upper levels with a predictable result based on seismic vibrations applied at the structure's base. Two main characteristics of the web-based application are interactivity, provided through synchronized control/response processes, and sensor-based monitoring of the experiment. (cont.) The system is built on the Microsoft. Net Framework through server-hosted Active Server Pages and browser-embedded Windows Form Controls.

As part of the Safeguards and Separations (SafeSeps) IPSC effort, interoperable process models are being developed that enable dynamic simulation of an advanced separations plant. A SafeSepss IPSC 'toolkit' is in development to enable the integration of separation process modules and safeguards tools into the design process by providing an environment to compose, verify and validate a simulation application to be used for analysis of various plant configurations and operating conditions. The modules of this toolkit will be implemented on a modern, <b>expandable</b> <b>architecture</b> with the flexibility to explore and evaluate a wide range of process options while preserving their stand-alone usability.
