40|$|Aim: Increasing sea-surface {{temperatures}} (SST) {{have resulted}} in poleward range expansions of scleractinian corals and declines in their core ranges. These changes may provide management opportunities for the long-term persistence of corals, but spatial prioritization rarely considers and anticipates these changes. We developed a spatio-temporal conservation plan that accommodates future coral range expansions based on projections of future SST. Our spatial planning approach is particularly useful in places with limited information about species distributions. Our aims were to (1) identify areas that consistently remain important for conservation through time and (2) determine the differences between priorities for conservation that account for potential coral range expansions and those that ignore them. Location: Japan. Methods: We developed spatial planning approaches using predicted coral <b>habitat</b> <b>distributions</b> for current conditions, the near future and the distant future. Using the Marxan conservation planning software, we designed conservation plans for scenarios that incorporated different types of spatial and temporal connections. Spatial connections are physical connections between adjacent and nearby areas, whereas temporal connections connect planning areas throughout time. Results: We found that protecting areas important for current and future coral <b>habitat</b> <b>distributions</b> is possible by prioritizing places that are consistently important through time. A spatially and temporally cohesive plan was accomplished with only a 14 % increase in the overall reserve system costs, compared with reserve systems ignoring future coral <b>habitat</b> <b>distributions.</b> The attributes of priority areas (e. g. locations, outside boundary length and size) were substantially different when we varied the types of connections. Main conclusions: This study demonstrated that areas with highest conservation priority now will not necessarily be optimal when planning for future change, such as coral range expansions. Furthermore, we showed that incorporating spatio-temporal connections into spatial prioritization achieves objectives of simultaneously conserving corals in the current climate and facilitating their expansions as SST rises...|$|R
40|$|Although species {{extinction}} {{has become}} a global concern during the last decade, our knowledge of species distribution patterns remains limited. If we don 2 ̆ 7 t know where a species has existed historically, we cannot determine if its range is contracting or expanding.

40|$|The {{morphology}} and {{anatomy of}} the monotypic genus Trizeuxis make this taxon almost impossible to recognize in fossil material and hereby difficult object of historical geographic studies. To estimate the distribution of potential refugia during the last glacial maximum and migration routes for Trizeuxis the ecological niche modeling was performed. The potential niche modeling was done using maximum entropy method implemented in Maxent application based on the species presence-only observations. As input data climatic variables and the digital elevation model were used. Two models of suitable glacial <b>habitats</b> <b>distribution</b> were prepared – for the studied species and for its host. The compiled map of the suitable <b>habitats</b> <b>distribution</b> of T. falcata and P. guajava during the last glacial maximum (LGM) indicate two possible refugia for the studied orchid genus. The first one was located in the Madre de Dios region {{and the other one}} in the Mosquito Coast. The models suggest the existence of two migration routes of Trizeuxis species. The results indicate that the ecological niche modeling (ENM) is a useful tool for analyzing not only the possible past distribution of the species, but may be also applied to determine the migration routes of the organisms not found in the fossil material...|$|R

50|$|Aside {{from the}} {{variation}} in climate, Eastern Australia also provides different ground cover substrates as potential habitats.

50|$|Environmental niche modelling, {{alternatively}} {{known as}} species distribution modelling, (ecological) niche modelling, predictive <b>habitat</b> <b>distribution</b> modelling, and climate envelope modelling {{refers to the}} process of using computer algorithms to predict the distribution of species in geographic space {{on the basis of a}} mathematical representation of their known distribution in environmental space (= realized ecological niche). The environment is in most cases represented by climate data (such as temperature, and precipitation), but other variables such as soil type, water depth, and land cover can also be used. These models allow for interpolating between a limited number of species occurrence and they are used in several research areas in conservation biology, ecology and evolution.|$|E
5000|$|Centrally governed {{enforcement}} of blast fishing sometimes has limited success, due to resistance of local populations and mistrust of central governments.

Due to this, effective blast fishing community control rely on education campaigns that bring awareness to the relationship between fish stock and fishing rates.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues in the management and conservation planning is the knowledge of habitat requirement for a target species (Tan et al. 2016; Villero et al. 2017). These requirements allow to define living and environmental conditions that limit the species distribution (Acevedo et al. 2010; Moreau et al. 2012). In many cases, the current <b>habitat</b> <b>distribution</b> for rare or endangered species diminished due to several factors related to human (e.g., forestry, agricultural lands, ranching, mining) or climate change factors (Jiménez-Valverde et al. 2008; Newbold 2010; Mikoláš et al. 2017). For an effective management and conservation strategies, the potential <b>habitat</b> <b>distribution</b> of the target species allows to (i) analyze the effectiveness of the current network of protection areas, (ii) improve the regional connectivity by setting up new conservation areas, and (iii) identify areas for potential restoration or re-introduction programs (Klaret al. 2008; Gilbert‐Norton et al. 2010; Zheng et al. 2016). Besides this, potential <b>habitat</b> <b>distribution</b> also allows to identify synergies and trade-offs with other economic activities (Luque et al. 2011; Carpentier et al. 2017; Martínez Pastur et al. 2017).|$|E
