5|$|A more area-selective {{method is}} {{electron}} energy loss spectroscopy, which measures the energy loss of an electron beam within a transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> when it interacts with {{a portion of}} a sample. The atom-probe tomograph has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.|$|E

25|$|<b>Electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{are used}} to {{investigate}} the ultrastructure {{of a wide range}} of biological and inorganic specimens including microorganisms, cells, large molecules, biopsy samples, metals, and crystals. Industrially, <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> are often used for quality control and failure analysis.

The majority of ER-C instrumental resources {{is available for}} use by both in-house and external users.|$|R
5|$|Electron {{microscopy}} {{offers a}} higher resolution image. In an <b>electron</b> <b>microscope,</b> {{a beam of}} focused electrons interacts with the sample rather than {{a beam of light}} as in traditional microscopy. In conjunction with rapid freezing techniques, electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport, for instance in demonstrating that exocytotic vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses.|$|E
5|$|Germination of cysts is {{accompanied}} by changes in the intima, visible with an <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b> The intima consists of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins and has almost the same volume as the central body. During germination of cysts, the intima hydrolyses and {{is used by the}} cell for the synthesis its components.|$|E
5|$|The <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> directs {{a focused}} beam of {{electrons}} at a specimen. Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material. Microscopists can record these changes in the electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material. In blue light, conventional optical microscopes have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200nm. By comparison, electron microscopes are limited by the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. This wavelength, for example, is equal to 0.0037nm for electrons accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential. The Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected Microscope is capable of sub-0.05nm resolution, {{which is more than}} enough to resolve individual atoms. This capability makes the <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging. However, electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain.|$|E
50|$|Microscopes can be {{separated}} into several different classes. One grouping {{is based on}} what interacts with the sample to generate the image, i.e., light or photons (optical <b>microscopes),</b> <b>electrons</b> (<b>electron</b> <b>microscopes)</b> or a probe (scanning probe microscopes). Alternatively, microscopes can be classed on whether they analyze the sample via a scanning point (confocal optical <b>microscopes,</b> scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> and scanning probe microscopes) or analyze the sample all at once (wide field optical <b>microscope</b> and transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes).</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> are {{expensive}} {{to build and}} maintain, but the capital and running costs of confocal light microscope systems now overlaps with those of basic <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes.</b> Microscopes designed to achieve high resolutions must be housed in stable buildings (sometimes underground) with special services such as magnetic field cancelling systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{two major}} types of <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> are {{transmission}} <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> (TEMs) and scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> (SEMs). They both have series of electromagnetic and electrostatic lenses to focus a high energy {{beam of electrons}} on a sample. In a TEM the electrons pass through the sample, analogous to basic optical microscopy. This requires careful sample preparation, since electrons are scattered strongly by most materials. The SEM has raster coils to scan the surface of bulk objects with a fine electron beam.|$|R
5|$|There are two distinct, though connected, {{regions of}} ER that differ in {{structure}} and function: smooth ER and rough ER. The {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} is so named because the cytoplasmic surface is covered with ribosomes, giving it a bumpy appearance when viewed through an <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b> The smooth ER appears smooth since its cytoplasmic surface lacks ribosomes.|$|E
5|$|A nucleus {{typically}} contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called Cajal bodies or coiled bodies (CB), whose diameter measures between 0.2µm and 2.0µm {{depending on}} the cell type and species. When seen under an <b>electron</b> <b>microscope,</b> they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin. CBs {{are involved in a}} number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation, and histone mRNA modification.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Young's {{interference}} experiment {{played a}} major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light. If white light is used in Young's experiment, the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits, surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity. In addition to continuous electromagnetic radiation, Young's experiment has been performed with individual photons, with electrons, and with buckyball molecules large enough to be seen under an <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b>|$|E
50|$|Wide field optical <b>microscopes</b> and {{transmission}} <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> both use {{the theory of}} lenses (optics for light microscopes and electromagnet lenses for <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes)</b> in order to magnify the image generated by {{the passage of a}} wave transmitted through the sample, or reflected by the sample. The waves used are electromagnetic (in optical <b>microscopes)</b> or <b>electron</b> beams (in <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes).</b> Resolution in these microscopes is limited by the wavelength of the radiation used to image the sample, where shorter wavelengths allow for a higher resolution.|$|R

50|$|Electron beam {{excitation}} {{is used in}} <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes,</b> scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> (SEM) and scanning transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> (STEM). X-ray beam excitation is used in X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometers. A detector is used {{to convert}} X-ray energy into voltage signals; this information is sent to a pulse processor, which measures the signals and passes them onto an analyzer for data display and analysis. The most common detector now is Si(Li) detector cooled to cryogenic temperatures with liquid nitrogen; however newer systems are often equipped with silicon drift detectors (SDD) with Peltier cooling systems.|$|R
5|$|The self-damage {{induced by}} the {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium {{is so strong that}} it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium. Further, owing to the small size of the available samples, the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b> Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point value.|$|E
5|$|When {{observed}} {{under the}} <b>electron</b> <b>microscope,</b> the nucleolus {{can be seen}} to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost fibrillar centers (FCs), surrounded by the dense fibrillar component (DFC), which in turn is bordered by the granular component (GC). Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the GC.|$|E
5|$|Academically, the University of Toronto {{is noted}} for {{influential}} movements and curricula in literary criticism and communication theory, known collectively as the Toronto School. The university was {{the birthplace of}} insulin and stem cell research, and {{was the site of}} the first practical <b>electron</b> <b>microscope,</b> the development of multi-touch technology, the identification of the first black hole Cygnus X-1, and the development of the theory of NP-completeness. By a significant margin, it receives the most annual scientific research funding of any Canadian university. It is one of two members of the Association of American Universities outside the United States, the other being McGill University in Montreal, Quebec.|$|E

500|$|Two main {{types of}} <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> exist: {{transmission}} and scanning. Transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> function like overhead projectors, with {{a beam of}} electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by lenses on a photographic slide or a charge-coupled device. [...] Scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> rasteri a finely focused electron beam, as in a TV set, across the studied sample to produce the image. Magnifications range from 100× to 1,000,000× or higher for both microscope types. The scanning tunneling microscope uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into the studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface.|$|R
5|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} {{description of}} the Chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first on an annual basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's original classification has been much honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be appreciated by {{a comparison of the}} images on this page. Even the light microscope image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E
5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an <b>electron</b> <b>microscope,</b> however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the nuclear reactor, Szilard submitted patent applications for a linear accelerator in 1928, and a cyclotron in 1929. He also conceived {{the idea of an}} <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b> Between 1926 and 1930, he worked with Einstein {{on the development of the}} Einstein refrigerator. After Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in 1933, Szilard urged his family and friends to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, where he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs. While in England he discovered a means of isotope separation known as the Szilard–Chalmers effect.|$|E

State-of-the-art <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> require state-of-the-art environments, and this means careful design and implementation of microscope sites, from the microscope room to the building that surrounds it. Laboratories have been constructed to house high-sensitive instruments with resolutions ranging down to sub-Angstrom levels; we present the various design philosophies used for some of these laboratories and our experiences with them. Four facilities are described: the National Center for Electron Microscopy OAM Laboratory at LBNL; the FEGTEM Facility at the University of Sheffield; the Center for Integrative Molecular Biosciences at TSRI; and the Advanced Microscopy Laboratory at ORNL...|$|R
5|$|Louis Pasteur and Edward Jenner {{were the}} first to develop {{vaccines}} to protect against viral infections. The nature of viruses remained unknown until the invention of the <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> in the 1930s, when the science of virology gained momentum. In the 20th century many diseases both old and new were found to be caused by viruses. There were epidemics of poliomyelitis that were only controlled following the development of a vaccine in the 1950s. HIV {{is one of the most}} pathogenic new viruses to have emerged in centuries. Although scientific interest in them arose because of the diseases they cause, most viruses are beneficial. They drive evolution by transferring genes across species, play important roles in ecosystems and are essential to life.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{luminescence}} colors is often unclear and not unique. Blue emission from type IIa and IIb diamonds is reliably identified with dislocations by directly correlating the emission with dislocations in an <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b> However, blue emission in type Ia diamond could be either due to dislocations or the N3 defects (three nitrogen atoms bordering a vacancy). Green emission in natural diamond is usually due to the H3 center (two substitutional nitrogen atoms separated by a vacancy), whereas in synthetic diamond it usually originates from nickel used as a catalyst (see figure). Orange or red emission {{could be due to}} various reasons, one being the nitrogen-vacancy center which is present in sufficient quantities in all types of diamond, even type IIb.|$|E
