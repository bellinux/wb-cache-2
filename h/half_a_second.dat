5|$|During {{the second}} part, the Mercedes drivers set only one run of timed laps {{as they were}} able to save their tyres for the race, well clear of the competition. Lewis Hamilton was fastest, <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> ahead of Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel between the two. Romain Grosjean was {{eliminated}} after a spin at turn six. He was joined on the sidelines by both Saubers, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Sergio Pérez.|$|E

In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks {{out from under the}} motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50N. This, acting on the 0.6m (2ft) height of the center of mass, generates a roll moment of 30N·m.|$|E

5|$|Geen got {{his second}} try after another break from Poulton. Cambridge {{meanwhile}} scored two tries and at half-time were leading 15–13. Fifteen {{minutes into the}} second <b>half,</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> try for Cambridge put them five points ahead. An injury to one of Cambridge's scoring wings reduced the team to fourteen players; a forward moved to cover the wing, giving Oxford an advantage in the forwards. Poulton capitalised on it: he scored from a dummy pass to Geen; and ran in a solo try after receiving a pass from flyhalf Freddie Knott. The end score was 23–18 to Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{once again}} {{set the time}} in Q2, almost a second ahead of second-placed Kimi Räikkönen, while Felipe Massa went faster than Sebastian Vettel in third. Alonso was {{eliminated}} in 14th position, ahead of Max Verstappen in the Toro Rosso, who was <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> slower than Carlos Sainz Jr., his teammate. Sergio Pérez joined the two Sauber drivers as the last three cars not {{to make it into}} the top 10.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} part, Lewis Hamilton quickly set a fast lap time, the quickest {{of the weekend}} up to that point, about <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> ahead of his {{teammate}} Rosberg. Meanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo set his fastest lap on the harder supersoft compound tyre, meaning {{that he would be}} able to start the race on them, should it have stayed dry. On the back end, Williams struggled for pace and both Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa missed out on Q3 by qualifying 11th and 14th respectively. Also eliminated were Esteban Gutiérrez, Jenson Button, Romain Grosjean and Magnussen.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} titanium {{is composed}} of 5 stable isotopes: 46Ti, 47Ti, 48Ti, 49Ti, and 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8% natural abundance). Eleven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 44Ti with a half-life of 63 years; 45Ti, 184.8 minutes; 51Ti, 5.76 minutes; and 52Ti, 1.7 minutes. All the other radioactive isotopes have half-lives less than 33 seconds and the majority, less than <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b>|$|E

5|$|As the frontrunners {{set their}} first timed laps in Q3, Hamilton {{made a mistake}} and ran wide at the last corner, leaving him behind Rosberg and both Ferrari drivers. Hülkenberg, both Williams drivers and Ricciardo were {{eliminated}} without setting another time, while the four fastest cars came out again. Hamilton set the fastest ever lap at the Bahrain Circuit, at 1:29.493, to achieve pole position ahead of Rosberg, who was just 0.077 seconds slower. <b>Half</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> behind, Vettel grabbed third place on the grid ahead of teammate Räikkönen. After qualifying, Hamilton's pole was put under threat after the FIA started an investigation after Hamilton reversed in the pit lane to park up. Hamilton was given a reprimand and his pole position stood.|$|E
5|$|At the start, Hamilton, Massa and Kovalainen all {{maintained}} their grid positions. Hamilton quickly {{began to pull}} away from the other cars, at the rate of about <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> per lap. Behind the leading trio, Kubica passed Räikkönen off the grid, and went on to pass both Alonso and Trulli at the hairpin (turn 4), when Alonso's own attempted pass on Trulli delayed both drivers. The fight for fourth position continued {{in the early stages of}} the race. Kubica ran wide at the final corner on lap four, impeding Trulli and therefore allowing Alonso to attempt an overtaking manoeuvre on the Toyota down the main straight. However, Trulli held on to his position, and Alonso was instead passed by Räikkönen, moving him down to sixth position. At the back of the field, Nakajima spun his Williams but recovered back onto the track and continued in the race.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{regained his}} German Grand Prix title at the Nürburgring at the 1928 German Grand Prix, driving the new 7.1-litre Mercedes-Benz SS. He shared the driving with Christian Werner, {{who took over}} Caracciola's car when the latter {{collapsed}} with heat exhaustion at a pit stop. The German Grand Prix, like many other races at the time, ignored the official Grand Prix racing rules set by the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (International Association of Recognized Auto Clubs, or AIACR), which limited weight and fuel consumption, and instead ran races under a Formula Libre, or free formula. As a result, Mercedes-Benz focused less on producing Grand Prix cars and more on sports cars, and Caracciola drove the latest incarnation of this line, the SSK, at the Semmering hillclimb, and further reduced his own record on the course by <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} discusses {{about the}} identity problems {{that derive from}} the First, One and <b>a</b> <b>Half,</b> and <b>Second</b> Generation of Modern Chinese American family in performing the identity. This research is constructed {{within the framework of}} American Studies as the interdisciplinary studies which applies interdisciplinary approaches such as the semiotics, the socio-cultural and the socio-psychological to answer its research questions. This research is descriptive qualitative research taking Dim Sum Funeral as a source of the primary data. The primary data consists in the form of characters, characterizations, dialogues and the combination of certain mise-en-scene elements (setting, figure behavior, costume) and cinematography elements (Camera Angle, Camera Movement, Shot Distance, Lighting). Based on data analyzed, it is found that: first, the struggles of first, one and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> and <b>second</b> generation to acknowledge their Chinese ethnicity and American characteristics as part of developing a dual Chinese American identity that is derived from their characteristics as Chinese American. Second, the problem comes from the contrast between Chinese ethnicity which is brought by the first generation and the American traits summoned by one and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> and <b>second</b> generation. The clash between first, one and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> and <b>second</b> generation block their performance of regaining the identity as Chinese American. Third, the result of dealing with the problem that is happened between the first, one and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> and <b>second</b> generation shown by the re-connecting of family bond and blending the combination between Chinese and American characteristic. The first, one and <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> and <b>second</b> generation dual identity as Chinese and American requires the Chinese American generation to be able to adjust to their society.

Three laps later, Truex had reduced Kurt Busch's lead to one second, as Martin moved into seventh on lap 28. One lap later, Kurt Busch extended his lead over Truex to 1.6 seconds, as Gordon moved into fifth position. On lap 33, Johnson passed Truex for second; Martin passed Gordon to claim fifth on lap 38. Four laps later, Johnson closed to <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> from Kurt Busch. Twelve laps later, Earnhardt dropped to twentieth position.

5|$|Hamilton took pole {{position}} for the ninth {{time in his career}} with a lap time of 1:15.666, having beaten Massa by two-tenths of a second in his final lap of the third session. Kovalainen, coming back after an error during his first run, qualified third, with Jarno Trulli taking fourth position. Alonso and Räikkönen were close together in fifth and sixth positions, with just 0.006seconds separating them. Kubica took a comfortable seventh, <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> quicker in the third session than eighth-placed Webber. Vettel and Coulthard completed the top ten. Timo Glock took 11th place on the grid for Toyota, seven places behind his teammate Trulli. He was immediately in front of compatriots Heidfeld and Rosberg. Jenson Button and Bourdais took 14th and 15th positions respectively. Both Heidfeld and Button later said that they suffered from tyre problems during the session.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was once}} again fastest during third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, even while suffering from overheating under his seat. The two Mercedes cars were separated by two-tenths of a second with the two Ferraris of Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen behind, another <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> down. Red Bull had a slight upturn in fortune, with Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat finishing fifth and sixth respectively. McLaren-Honda had another problematic session as Fernando Alonso stopped the car just after starting his installation lap. Teammate Jenson Button was called into the pit lane as well, citing a similar problem with the engine, but was able to continue later in the session. Felipe Massa experienced smoke in his cockpit both on Friday and Saturday, apparently caused by the new titanium plates underneath the cars which also create sparks when driving over bumps on the track.|$|E

5|$|Having {{observed}} the sessions and received {{feedback from the}} drivers and the teams about the circuit conditions, the series' president of competition Brian Barnhart and course designer Tony Cotman opted to postpone the qualification session to race morning, with the running of a third practice session and a Sunday morning warm-up instead of it. Power topped this extra session, ahead of Kanaan and Ryan Hunter-Reay, with Justin Wilson—a new arrival at Dreyer & Reinbold Racing—in fourth position. After the session, track officials started grinding down the concrete {{in order to provide}} a track surface that was suitable for racing the following day. Hunter-Reay topped the Sunday morning warmup before qualifying, setting the fastest lap time by over <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> ahead of second-year driver Mike Conway in another Dreyer & Reinbold car.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rain {{continued}} {{to affect the}} track in the second practice session. Conditions deteriorated as the session advanced, and several cars elected not to improve their quickest times to avoid driving off the track after going through standing water. Conditions allowed the fastest LMP2 and LMGTE vehicles {{to reach the top}} five quickest overall times. Bamber recorded the fastest time at 2:25.495, nearly <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> faster than Bernhard in the sister Porsche in second. Lotterer was third-fastest and had the fastest time early in the session. Evans achieved the only time under the 2:34.500 mark in LMP2 with a lap of 2:34.370. Lietz led LMGTE Pro with No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari of Rui Águas the fastest driver in LMGTE Am.|$|E
5|$|In Q3, Nico Rosberg ran wide at turn 15 on {{his first}} flying lap and lost the chance to seek areas of {{improvement}} for his second run. Lewis Hamilton, who was fastest in all three sessions, capitalized on his teammate's problem and took pole position by over <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> It was his 39th pole position and his 4th at Albert Park. The {{rest of the field}} was more than a second behind Hamilton's time, with Felipe Massa in the Williams best of the rest in third position.
