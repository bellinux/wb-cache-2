Since calsequestrin is believed to provide the major site of Ca 2 + sequestration in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the present results support the view that Ca 2 +, transported to the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is preferentially sequestered in the terminal cisternae, but they also suggest that additional Ca 2 + sequestration may occur {{near the center of the}} I band...|$|R
