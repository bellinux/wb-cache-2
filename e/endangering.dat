40|$|<b>Endangered</b> {{species are}} often the focus of public attention, partly because of their {{vulnerability}} to environmental changes, such as climate and land use change, and subsequently being {{at high risk of}} extinctions. Hence, red lists of <b>endangered</b> species play anessential in nature conservation. Although several <b>endangered</b> butterfly species have been previously listed as <b>endangered</b> species by government and/or individuals in South Korea, these red listsrarely include reliable quantitative population data. This has led to endless and unproductive debates on the selection of <b>endangered</b> species. Following Korean butterfly atlases, we assessed the population status of Korean <b>endangered</b> butterfly species whose distributions have been previously published. We hypothesized that these <b>endangered</b> species are rare and are decreasing in occurrence. We found that the decrease in occurrence is more important in determining <b>endanger</b> status than rarity. Using values of rarity and shifts in species occurrence, we selected <b>endangered</b> species from the previously published <b>endangered</b> species. Only eight species of 20 previous <b>endangered</b> species were defined as <b>endangered</b> by this semi-quantitative classification. This finding suggests that the subjective determination based on expert's perception would define more species as <b>endangered</b> compared to the quantitative determination based on population data. ...|$|R
