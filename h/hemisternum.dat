40|$|My {{colleagues and}} I present {{a method for}} revascularizing the left anterolateral {{myocardial}} wall by using an in situ left internal thoracic artery to left anterior descending coronary artery system and a short proximal segment (3 to 5 cm) of the right internal thoracic artery in Y fashion anastomosed to the in situ left internal thoracic artery to revascularize the obtuse marginal branches. With this technique the left ventricular anterolateral wall can be revascularized with both internal thoracic arteries, leaving a consistent residual blood supply to the right <b>hemisternum...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} prospectively {{evaluate}} the long-term effect of left {{internal thoracic artery}} harvesting on sternal vascularity. Methods: Twelve consecutive patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass grafting were studied. In all patients a pedicled left internal thoracic artery was harvested. Each patient underwent a preoperative technetium- 99 m methylene diphosphonate bone scan with single photon emission computed tomography. The ratio of the mean counts per pixel for {{each side of the}} sternum was obtained. All patients had early repeat bone scans 6 ± 2. 4 days postoperatively and late repeat bone scans 18. 6 ± 3. 5 months after the operation. Ratios of unilateral sternal uptakes were compared between the different scans. One patient died during follow-up and was excluded from the study. Results: There was a significant decrease in flow to the left <b>hemisternum</b> in the early postoperative scan compared with that in the preoperative scan (P <. 001). At late follow-up scans, flow to the left <b>hemisternum</b> had returned to normal (P =. 119). Midterm clinical follow-up demonstrated 3 superficial wound infections. No musculoskeletal pain existed at the time of follow-up, but 3 patients had numbness or tingling at the skin area corresponding to the site from which the left internal thoracic artery was harvested. Conclusions: Acute postoperative sternal ischemia caused by harvesting of a pedicled left internal thoracic artery is temporary and resolves with time.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Topical {{negative}} pressure therapy has excellent healing effects in poststernotomy mediastinitis. Topical {{negative pressure}} therapy reduces bacterial counts, increases wound edge microvascular blood flow and granulation tissue formation, and facilitates healing. No study {{has yet been}} performed to {{examine the effect of}} topical negative pressure on the blood and fluid content in the sternal bone marrow, which is a crucial component in osteitis. METHODS: Eight pigs underwent median sternotomy, left internal thoracic artery harvesting, followed by topical negative pressure treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify both tissue fluid and/or blood content (T 2 -weighted short tau inversion recovery [T 2 -STIR]) and internal thoracic artery blood flow (flow quantification). RESULTS: Before application of topical negative pressure, the T 2 -STIR signal intensity ratio was lower for the left than for the right <b>hemisternum</b> (left, 1. 3; right, 2. 6), indicating lower levels of tissue fluid content on the left, devascularized side. On application of topical negative pressure, the T 2 -STIR signal intensity ratio increased immediately for both the sternal bone and the pectoral muscle (left <b>hemisternum</b> after 4 minutes of topical negative pressure: 2. 3), leveled off after 4 minutes, and remained unchanged for the ensuing 40 minutes, suggesting movement of fluid and/or blood into the tissue of the wound edge. Topical negative pressure did not affect blood flow in the right internal thoracic artery. CONCLUSIONS: T 2 -STIR measurements show that topical negative pressure increases sternotomy wound edge tissue fluid and/or blood content. Topical negative pressure creates a pressure gradient that presumably draws fluid from the surrounding tissue to the sternal wound edge and into the vacuum source. This "endogenous drainage" may be one possible mechanism by which osteitis is resolved by topical negative pressure in poststernotomy mediastinitis...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that in patients with chronic complex sternum dehiscence, the use of muscle flap repair minimizes the occurrence of paradoxical motion of the chest wall (CWPM) when compared to sternal rewiring, eventually leading to better respiratory function and clinical outcomes during follow-up. Methods: In a propensity score matching analysis, out of 94 patients who underwent sternal reconstruction, 20 patients were selected: 10 patients underwent sternal reconstruction with bilateral pectoralis muscle flaps (group 1) and 10 underwent sternal rewiring (group 2). Eligibility criteria included the presence of <b>hemisternum</b> diastases associated with multiple (≥ 3) bone fractures and radiologic evidence of synchronous chest wall motion (CWSM). We compared radiologically assessed (volumetric computed tomography) ventilatory mechanic indices such as single lung and global vital capacity (VC), diaphragm excursion, synchronous and paradoxical chest wall motion. Results: Follow-up was 100...|$|E
40|$|Aneurysms of the {{aortic arch}} and {{descending}} aorta are invariably fatal if left to expand, but also represent considerable surgical challenges. The development of endovascular stent grafts {{in combination with}} aortic debranching has produced results at least comparable to the more traditional surgical approach, but with considerably less comorbidity. We describe a technique for debranching of the aortic arch {{without the use of}} circulatory support, and in doing so creating a landing zone for thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TE-VAR). Although this procedure has been described, innovative features of our technique include transection of the left <b>hemisternum</b> to produce excellent surgical exposure, and ligation of the debranched arch vessels to prevent Type II endoleaks following TEVAR. Additionally, by not using mechanical circulatory support, we remove the associated pathophysiological insult, inflammatory response, and coagulopathy that is synonymous with cardiopulmonary bypass. There is also no need for circulatory arrest, with its associated perils...|$|E
