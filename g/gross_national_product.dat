40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze and assess the pattern of fertilizers utilization and their relation to agricultural production, and to estimate the relationship between fertilizers and <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> agricultural <b>product</b> in Saudi Arabian economy. Time series and cross sectional data were used in this study. Simple and multiple regression techniques, beside adequate tests of significance, were applied to obtain quantitative estimates. The study showed that the intensification of fertili¬zers in Saudi agriculture varies according to farm size and between various regions of the kingdom. Aggregate product¬ion function was specified and statistically estimated on the macro level of the Saudi agriculture. The estimated production function was used to simulate the impact of fer¬tilizer variations, as well as other factors of production, on the <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> agricultural <b>product</b> of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It could be concluded, according to the results of this study, that 1 % increase in cropped area, number of animal units, quantity of fertilizers used, and the real value of short term loans for all agricultural purposes, other than fertilizers, would result in 0, 52 % increase in gross natio¬nal agricultural product. Should other factors of production be held constant, an increase in the-quantity of fertilizers used, of 1 % would be reflected in 0, 086 % increase in the <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> agricultural <b>products...</b>|$|R

5|$|During {{the civil}} war and the ensuing Soviet war in Afghanistan, most of the country's {{infrastructure}} was destroyed. Normal patterns of economic activity were disrupted. The <b>Gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>product</b> (GNP) fell substantially during Karmal's rule because of the conflict; trade and transport was disrupted with loss of labor and capital. In 1981 the Afghan GDP stood at 154.3 billion Afghan afghanis, a drop from 159.7 billion in 1978. GNP per capita decreased from 7,370 in 1978 to 6,852 in 1981. The dominant form of economic activity was in the agricultural sector. Agriculture accounted for 63 {{percent of gross domestic product}} (GDP) in 1981; 56 percent of the labor force was working in agriculture in 1982. Industry accounted for 21 percent of GDP in 1982, and employed 10 percent of the labor force. All industrial enterprises were government-owned. The service sector, the smallest of the three, accounted for 10 percent of GDP in 1981, and employed an estimated one-third of the labour force. The balance of payments, which had grown in the pre-communist administration of Muhammad Daoud Khan, decreased, turning negative by 1982 at 70.3 million $US.

5|$|Varying {{definitions}} of the term First World and {{the uncertainty of the}} term in today's world leads to different indicators of First World status. In 1945, the United Nations used the terms first, second, third, and fourth worlds to define the relative wealth of nations (although popular use of the term fourth world did not come about until later). There are some references towards culture in the definition. They were defined in terms of <b>Gross</b> <b>National</b> <b>Product</b> (GNP), measured in U.S. dollars, along with other socio-political factors. The first world included the large industrialized, democratic (free elections, etc.) nations. The second world included modern, wealthy, industrialized nations, but they were all under communist control. Most {{of the rest of the}} world was deemed part of the third world, while the fourth world was considered to be those nations whose people were living on less than US$100 annually. If we use the term to mean high-income industrialized economies, then the World Bank classifies countries according to their GNI or gross national income per capita. The World Bank separates countries into four categories: high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income, and low-income economies. The First World is considered to be countries with high-income economies. The high-income economies are equated to mean developed and industrialized countries.|$|E

But opportunity of this sort is a paradigmatically financial category, hence one that falls squarely within the IFIs 2 ̆ 7 bailiwick.
