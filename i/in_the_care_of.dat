5|$|Because of {{the status}} of Lipizzans as the only breed of horse {{developed}} in Slovenia, via the Lipica stud that is now located within its borders, Lipizzans are recognized in Slovenia as a national animal. For example, a pair of Lipizzans is featured on the 20-cent Slovenian euro coins. Mounted regiments of Carabinieri police in Italy also employ the Lipizzan as one of their mounts. In October 2008, during a visit to Slovenia, a Lipizzan at Lipica, named 085 Favory Canissa XXII, was given to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. She decided to leave the animal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the stud farm.|$|E

5|$|Edward is an Anglo-Saxon name, {{and was not}} {{commonly}} given {{among the}} aristocracy of England after the Norman conquest, but Henry was devoted to the veneration of Edward the Confessor, and decided to name his firstborn son after the saint.

Henry of Almain would remain a close companion of the prince, both through the civil war that followed, and later during the crusade.

5|$|Following {{complaints}} from local media over {{limited access to}} Goldschmidt's public papers stored at the Oregon Historical Society (OHS), the state archivist announced May 29 that Goldschmidt would seize the 256 boxes of documents to guarantee public access as defined in a state law passed in 1973. That law required that public access to such records be maintained, but did not specify where the records be kept. Following Goldschmidt's decision to put the documents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the OHS, the state legislature passed a law requiring future governors to leave their documents in the state archives. Many records were published on the state archives' Web site in early 2005.|$|E
