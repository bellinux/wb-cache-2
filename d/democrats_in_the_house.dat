5|$|Outside of the Western hemisphere, Hayes's biggest {{foreign policy}} concern dealt with China. In 1868, the Senate had {{ratified}} the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese immigrants into the country. As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen's wages. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, anti-Chinese riots {{broke out in}} San Francisco, and a third party, the Workingman's Party, was formed {{with an emphasis on}} stopping Chinese immigration. In response, Congress passed a Chinese Exclusion Act in 1879, abrogating the 1868 treaty. Hayes vetoed the bill, believing that the United States should not abrogate treaties without negotiation. The veto drew praise among eastern liberals, but Hayes was bitterly denounced in the West. In the subsequent furor, <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives attempted to impeach him, but narrowly failed when Republicans prevented a quorum by refusing to vote. After the veto, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward suggested that both countries work together to reduce immigration, and he and James Burrill Angell negotiated with the Chinese to do so. Congress passed a new law to that effect, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, after Hayes left office.|$|E
5|$|When Randall {{returned}} to Washington in 1881 {{to begin his}} term in the 47th Congress, the legislature was controlled by Republicans. After Garfield's assassination later that year, Vice President Chester A. Arthur assumed the presidency. Arthur, like most Republicans, favored high tariffs, but he sought to simplify the tariff structure and to reduce excise taxes. Randall, who had {{returned to}} his seat on the Appropriations Committee, favored the president's plan, and was among the few <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> to support the it. The bill {{that emerged from the}} Ways and Means Committee, dominated by protectionists, provided for only a 10 percent reduction. After conference with the Senate, the resulting bill had an even smaller effect, reducing tariffs by an average of 1.47 percent. It passed both houses narrowly on March3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed the measure into law. Toward the end, Randall took less part in the debate, feeling the tension between his supporters in the House, who wanted more reductions, and his constituents at home, who wanted less.|$|E
25|$|Despite Truman's all-out {{effort to}} stop the veto override, Congress overrode his veto with {{considerable}} Democratic support, including 106 out of 177 <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> and 20 out of 42 Democrats in the Senate.|$|E

25|$|The FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC {{is named}} the J. Edgar Hoover Building, after Hoover. Because of the {{controversial}} nature of Hoover's legacy, there have been periodic proposals to rename it by legislation proposed by both Republicans and <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> and Senate. For example, in 2001 Senator Harry Reid sponsored an amendment to strip Hoover's name from the building. Reid said J. Edgar Hoover's name on the FBI building is a stain on the building. The Senate did not adopt the amendment.|$|E

25|$|In early 2012, Delegate Norton {{agreed to}} {{organize}} her fellow <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> {{in opposition to}} redesignation of the D.C. War Memorial. In the spring, Norton's staff worked out an agreement with Poe and Cleaver in which they agreed to prohibit infringement on the D.C. memorial. In exchange, Norton agreed to support construction of a national World War I memorial on the National Mall. Yet, {{by the summer of}} 2012, D.C. officials, Norton, and their congressional supporters were pushing for a national World War I memorial at Pershing Park. The D.C. Council passed a nonbinding resolution to that effect in June. Norton's shift in attitude came after National Park Service officials convinced her that allowing construction on the Mall would severely weaken the Commemorative Works Act, an amendment to which in 2003 had all but banned new memorials on the Mall. Meanwhile, discussion among members of Congress had turned toward giving the World War I Centennial Commission authority to build the new memorial. The centennial commission, too, concluded that there was no room on the Mall to build a memorial.|$|E
25|$|Melissa Bean, of Barrington was the {{incumbent}} {{representative of the}} 8th district, having displaced Phil Crane in the 2004 election. Bean {{is considered to be}} one of the more conservative Democrats currently serving in the House, having voted the Democratic Party line only 79.5% during the first 18 months of her term. Only 26 Democratic Representatives, out of 201 serving during her first term, had more conservative voting records. Bean identifies as a Blue Dog Democrat, meaning she tends to be slightly more socially conservative, and much more fiscally conservative, than other <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> Indeed, Bean was one of the few Democratic supporters of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, a move which cost her the endorsement of the AFL-CIO. She also voted to extend a package of tax cuts passed by the Republican-controlled congress, a dramatic break from the Democratic Party's official position on the cuts. However, her fiscally conservative voting record earned Bean the endorsement of the United States Chamber of Commerce. The organization, composed mainly of small businesses, rarely endorses Democrats, feeling that the positions advocated by the Party are harmful to businesses.|$|E
25|$|Taylor was {{a member}} of the Blue Dog Coalition, and his voting record was one of the most {{conservative}} among <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> He has become a leading Democratic Member of the House Armed Services Committee. He led committee and floor fights to improve the medical benefits of military retirees, and to extend TRICARE health insurance to members of the National Guard and Reserves. Taylor also has focused on U.S. policy in Latin America, sponsoring the successful cap on the number of U.S. troops that can be sent to Colombia without explicit Congressional authorization. Taylor also was a leading critic of the Base Realignment and Closure process, accusing the Department of Defense of smuggling in policy changes that were unrelated to excess capacity or facilities. Taylor served as the Ranking Democrat on the Projection Forces Subcommittee in the 109th Congress, and became chairman of the renamed Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces in the 110th Congress. He and the previous subcommittee chairman Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD), who is now the ranking member of the subcommittee, advocate for more nuclear-powered surface ships in order to reduce the Navy's dependence on imported oil. Taylor is also a member of the Readiness subcommittee of the Armed Services committee in the 110th Congress.|$|E

[...] McCain sided with Newt Gingrich's group of young conservatives in some of their battles against the House Democratic leadership, but declined to join Gingrich's Conservative Opportunity Society.

500|$|Blaine {{entered the}} 1876 presidential {{campaign}} as the favorite, but his chances were almost immediately harmed by {{the emergence of}} a scandal. Rumors had begun to spread in February of that year that Blaine had been involved in a transaction with the Union Pacific Railroad in which the railroad had paid Blaine $64,000 for some Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad bonds he owned, even though the bonds were nearly worthless. [...] In essence, the alleged transaction was presented as a sham designed to bribe Blaine. Blaine denied the charges, as did the Union Pacific’s directors. Blaine claimed he never had any dealings with the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad except to purchase bonds at market price, and that he had lost money on the transaction. <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives nevertheless demanded a Congressional investigation. The testimony appeared to favor Blaine’s version of events until May 31, when James Mulligan, a Boston clerk formerly employed by Blaine’s brother-in-law, testified that the allegations were true, that he had arranged the transaction, and that he had letters to prove it. The letters ended with the damning phrase, “Kindly burn this letter." [...] When the investigating committee recessed, Blaine met with Mulligan that night in his hotel room. [...] What transpired between the men is unclear, but Blaine either acquired the letters or, as Mulligan told the committee, snatched them from Mulligan's hands and fled the room. [...] In any event, Blaine had the letters and refused the committee's demand to turn them over.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, DeLay {{worked to}} ensure that the House vote on impeaching President Bill Clinton was successful.
