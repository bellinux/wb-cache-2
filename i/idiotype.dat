40|$|Since {{their first}} {{description}} over 20 years ago, <b>idiotypes</b> {{have been used}} extensively to study {{various aspects of the}} immune system (1, 2). <b>Idiotypes,</b> antigenic determinants associated with immunoglobulin-variable regions, have been found on VH and VL regions, or both (3 - 11), and have been localized to both antigen-binding and framework regions (12 - 17). Those <b>idiotypes</b> shared by immunoglobulins known to be structurally different are designated IdX, 1 cross-reactive or public <b>idiotypes,</b> whereas those apparently restricted to one or a few closely related types of molecules are designated IdI, individual or private <b>idiotypes.</b> In spite of these general descriptive associations, the molecular bases for <b>idiotypes</b> have not been precisely defined. This lack of molecular correlation stands in striking contrast to the precise structural correlations for the constant region allotypes of rabbit and human immunoglobulins where allotype-positive and-negative proteins differ by only one or a few amino acid residues.

By means of the heteroantiidiotypic antibodies raised in rabbits we observed the presence of increased levels of shared <b>idiotypes</b> in serum and/or immune complexes (IC) of 48 out of 70 (68. 5 %) genetically unrelated patients with IgA nephropathy.

5000|$|The word [...] "idiotype" [...] became {{influential}} in immunology when Niels Jerne formulated his immune network theory.

5000|$|Unlike a {{preventative}} vaccine, such as for measles or mumps, BiovaxID {{is administered}} as a therapeutic cancer vaccine, designed to stimulate and [...] "train" [...] the patient's {{immune system to}} respond and attack cancerous cells, even long after therapy has been stopped — each vaccine being unique to that particular patient. Beginning with an excisional (>2 cm) lymph node biopsy, tumor cells are fused with Biovest's proprietary mouse/human heterohybridoma in order to induce secretion of normally surface-bound tumor immunoglobulin (<b>idiotype</b> or Id). Id-secreting clones are identified by a bioinformatics approach which confirms a match of each vaccine's unique <b>idiotype</b> sequence to the tumor’s after which they are cultured (expanded) in a personal-scale, disposable hollow-fiber AutovaxID™ bioreactor system. In this manner, each vaccine is highly-specifically matched to highly-unique segments of the patient's tumor genome. During culture, supernatant (containing <b>idiotype)</b> is collected until sufficient amounts have been produced to yield adequate dosage of vaccine. This supernatant is purified by affinity chromatography and conjugated (bonded) to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH), an immune-stimulating carrier protein, resulting in a finished vaccine that can be shipped and administered to patients. In the Phase III clinical trial, manufacturing success was approximately 95% of treated patients.|$|E

40|$|Several human {{monoclonal}} immunoglobulins {{with the}} same autoantibody activity {{have been shown to}} have cross-reactive <b>idiotypes</b> (CRI). In this study, using polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies, we found that 28 % of human monoclonal immunoglobulins with polyreactive autoantibody activity from myeloma, Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia and cryoglobulinaemia patients shared common <b>idiotype(s).</b> Furthermore, the latter were expressed on human and murine natural MoAbs (respectively in 12 % and 22 % of the clones tested) and on human IgG preparations used for therapeutic intravenous injections (IVIg) and which contain natural antibodies. These findings suggest that monoclonal immunoglobulins could arise from the proliferation of a clone that normally produces a natural antibody.

40|$|In {{spite of}} their many facets, the {{phenomena}} of autoimmunity and immunodeficiency seem {{to be related to}} each other through the subtle links connecting retroviral mutation and action to immune response and adaptation. In a previous work, we introduced a network model of how a set of interrelated genotypes (called a quasispecies, in the stationary state) and a set of interrelated <b>idiotypes</b> (an idiotypic network) interact. That model, which does not cover the case of a retroviral quasispecies, was instrumental for the study of quasispecies survival when confronting the immune system and led to the conclusion that, unlike what happens when a quasispecies is left to evolve by itself, letting genotypes mutate too infrequently leads to the destruction of the quasispecies. Here we extend that genotype-idiotype interaction model by the addition of a further parameter (ν) to account for the action of retroviruses (i. e., the destruction of <b>idiotypes</b> by genotypes). We give simulation results within a suitable parameter niche, highlighting the issues of quasispecies survival and of the onset of autoimmunity through the appearance of the so-called pathogenic <b>idiotypes.</b> Our main findings refer to how ν and λ, a parameter describing the rate at which <b>idiotypes</b> get stimulated, relate to each other. While for ν>λ the quasispecies survives at the expense of weakening the immune system significantly or even destroying it, for ν<λ the fittest genotypes of the quasispecies become mimicked inside the immune system as pathogenic <b>idiotypes.</b> The latter is in agreement with the current understanding of the HIV quasispecies...|$|R
40|$|In murine Schistosoma mansoni infections, schistosome-specific {{cross-reactive}} <b>idiotypes</b> (CRI) {{are present}} in the sera of mice with moderate splenomegaly syndrome (MSS) at 20 wk after infection. In contrast, sera from animals that have the more severe hypersplenomegaly syndrome (HSS) at 20 wk of infection do not express these CRI in their sera. To examine when these regulatory CRI first appear in mice that eventually develop MSS, sera from infected animals were monitored for CRI from 1. 5 to 20 wk of infection. In mice that eventually developed MSS, CRI were detected by 5 to 6 wk after infection, plateaued by 8 to 10 wk, and persisted through 20 wk of infection. Animals that developed HSS pathology or that died before 20 wk of infection never expressed CRI. Moreover, CRI levels present in the sera of mice at 6 wk of infection were inversely correlated with splenomegaly and hepatic fibrosis, but not with parasitologic measures, at 20 wk after infection. These results suggest that critical events occur very early in some schistosome infections that induce the production of regulatory <b>idiotypes</b> and that {{the presence or absence of}} these <b>idiotypes</b> predicts, and possibly determines, subsequent morbidity.

Since BiovaxID is a personalized vaccine, each patient’s vaccine is individually manufactured from a tissue biopsy obtained from a patient’s own tumor.

So, when a full, high-fidelity copy of the <b>idiotype</b> is linked to a foreign protein (KLH), and administered with an immune-enhancing agent (GM-CSF), the resulting vaccine can mount a highly specific anti-lymphoma attack that “trains” the body’s own immune system to solely recognize the <b>idiotype</b> as a “foreign invader”, thus stimulating and recruiting the patient’s own immune system to destroy micro-pockets of cancer cells that may remain following chemotherapy and potentially target and destroy newly arising lymphoma cells, thus delaying or preventing cancer recurrence. As such, through its unique mode of action, and exemplary safety record, BiovaxID represents a new therapeutic approach to treating follicular lymphoma.|$|E

A new anti-idiotypic serum was preparedwith the serum to S. a. e. collected after this boost and {{was used for the}} following isiotypic suppression attempt made 10 months after the first one. Using this procedurewe succeeded in two successive idiotypic suppression attempts in the same rabbit. Inthe three attempts we carried out, idiotypic suppression was totally effective, i. e. <b>idiotypes</b> detected by the serum used for the suppression totally disappeared after thesuppression, and the suppression lasted during the life of the rabbits (maximum 10 months). This observation is consistent with a suppression resulti-g from an interaction of anti-idiotypic antibodies with the complementary receptors at the surface of memory cells. This suppression was without effect on antibody to S. a. e. titre and on IgG concentration. <b>Idiotypes</b> detected by the anti-idiotypic serum prepared withthe serum to S. a. e. collected after the suppression.
