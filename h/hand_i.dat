5|$|Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight short, simple words....For {{a part of}} {{a second}} I glimpsed my mother and my sisters moving away to the right. Tzipora held Mother's <b>hand.</b> <b>I</b> saw them {{disappear}} into the distance; my mother was stroking my sister's fair hair...and I did not know that in that place, at that moment, I was parting from my mother and Tzipora forever.|$|E

5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, but on the other <b>hand</b> <b>I</b> have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E

25|$|Walter Lowrie reminds {{the reader}} that Kierkegaard has said, 'With my right <b>hand</b> <b>I</b> held out the Edifying Discourses, with my left the {{aesthetic}} works-and all grasped with the right hand what I held in my left.’ This would pair right and left as Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions and Stages on Life’s Way, then Three Discourses in Various Spirits with A Literary Review; and The Lilies of the Field and the Birds of the Air with Either/Or, 2nd edition. He indicates a plan to Kierkegaard's writing.|$|E

25|$|I’m {{well aware}} that I {{sometimes}} “shoot from the hip” and speak on things about which I know very little. In this present situation, I published my personal opinions about drug addiction without knowing very much about the neuroscience behind addiction, or the addiction recovery field. Not only did I say some deeply regrettable and insensitive things, but as I’ve learned more about the questions and issues at <b>hand,</b> <b>I</b> accept that I have been wrongheaded {{on a number of}} topics related to these issues. Even at 84, I’m still learning. Please bear with me, folks.|$|E

500|$|Many in the German navy {{were furious}} over Ingenohl's timidity, and his {{reputation}} suffered greatly. Großadmiral Alfred von Tirpitz remarked that [...] "On 16 December, Ingenohl had {{the fate of}} Germany {{in the palm of}} his <b>hand.</b> <b>I</b> boil with inward emotion whenever I think of it." [...] The captain of the battlecruiser [...] was even more scathing; he stated that Ingenohl had turned away [...] "because he was afraid of eleven British destroyers which could have been easily eliminated ... Under the present leadership we will accomplish nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, the Latter Days {{screenplay}} {{was adapted}} into {{a novel by}} freelance writer T. Fabris, which was published by Alyson Publications. The book was faithful to the film, but added several extra scenes that explained confusing aspects of the film and gave more about the characters' backgrounds. For example, the reason Ryder tells Christian where to find Aaron is his own broken heart over a girl {{he fell in love}} with while on his mission training. The novel also added dialogue that had been cut out of the film: finishing, for example Christian's cry– in the film– of [...] "That's the <b>hand</b> <b>I</b> use to..." [...] with [...] "masturbate with." ...|$|E

500|$|You {{know that}} as a female I am {{particularly}} attached to her—I feel more than a mother's fondness and anxiety, when I reflect on the dependent and oppressed state of her sex. I dread lest she {{should be forced to}} sacrifice her heart to her principles, or principles to her heart. With trembling <b>hand</b> <b>I</b> shall cultivate sensibility, and cherish delicacy of sentiment, lest, whilst I lend fresh blushes to the rose, I sharpen the thorns that will wound the breast I would fain guard—I dread to unfold her mind, lest it should render her unfit for the world she is to inhabit—Hapless woman! what a fate is thine! ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Schumacher {{admitted}} to having mixed feelings after the race, having been in second position until the race's last laps. The Mercedes driver stated: [...] "I would obviously have loved to finish there [...] and be on the podium again. But {{even if it did}} not work out in the very end, we can be happy about the result and the big fight we put in." [...] Kobayashi, placed second at the restart, shared similar feelings to Schumacher about finishing in a lower position: [...] "Originally I qualified 13th so then it is not bad to finish seventh, but on the other <b>hand</b> <b>I</b> started second after the long red flag and looking from there the result is disappointing." ...|$|E

500|$|Gittings {{was an avid}} music lover, most {{interested}} in Baroque and Renaissance music. She sang in choral groups {{for most of her}} life, spending over 50 years in the Philadelphia Chamber Chorus. She was also a hiking and canoeing enthusiast. She and her lifelong partner, Kay Tobin (also known as Kay Tobin Lahusen; born 1930) met in 1961 at a picnic in Rhode Island. Gittings described how they began: [...] "We hit it off, we started courting. I flew to Boston [...] and got off the plane with a big bunch of flowers in my <b>hand.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't resist. I did not care what the world thought. I dropped the flowers, grabbed her and kissed her. That was not being done in 1961." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} Darwinism informs his {{everyday}} apprehension of life, Dawkins says, [...] "in one way it does. My eyes are constantly wide {{open to the}} extraordinary fact of existence. Not just human existence but the existence of life and how this breathtakingly powerful process, which is natural selection, has managed to take the very simple facts of physics and chemistry and build them up to redwood trees and humans. That's never far from my thoughts, that sense of amazement. On the other <b>hand</b> <b>I</b> certainly don't allow Darwinism to influence my feelings about human social life," [...] implying that he feels that individual human beings can {{opt out of the}} survival machine of Darwinism since they are freed by the consciousness of self.|$|E
