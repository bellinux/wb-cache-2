50|$|In early 1924 S T D Motors went to {{the public}} to borrow funds amounting to around 15 per cent of its <b>fully</b> <b>paid</b> <b>capital.</b> No purpose for the {{borrowing}} was published but it {{is believed to have}} been to fund Coatalen's ambitions for the group's racing cars. Increased profits did not materialise and within five years the group's financial reserves were exhausted and plant and machinery was becoming obsolete and the group's products were becoming outmoded. After certain undertakings were made to their bankers the company's preference shareholders received their 1925-1926 dividend — in 1929. The financial problems of the 1920s were thought to have been ended by a court-sanctioned financial reconstruction in June 1930. At that time the substantial accumulated losses were recognised and the ordinary capital chopped down to one-third of its value. Financial commentators could see that the only assets were shares in or loans to other companies making evaluation difficult.|$|E
