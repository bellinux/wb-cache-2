5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{access to}} illegal content (such as child pornography) was {{strictly}} self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side <b>filtering</b> <b>system</b> which uses {{data obtained from}} the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious content {{to be added to}} their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.|$|E

The web resources are {{claimed to be}} controversial or offensive (i.e. sexually explicit content, certain political and religious websites, anonymizers and proxies) or harmful (i.e. numeric IP addresses, known phishing or malicious websites, botnet command servers). The use of content filtering is mandated by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) of the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
25|$|As {{of early}} September 2011 the {{operating}} {{rate of the}} <b>filtering</b> <b>system</b> exceeded the target of 90 percent for the first time. 85,000 tons of water were decontaminated by September 11, with over 100,000 tons of waste-water remaining to be treated at the time. However, the nuclear waste generated by the filters had already filled almost 70 percent of the 800 cubic meters of storage space available at the time. TEPCO {{had to figure out}} how to cool the reactors with less than 15 tons of water per day in order to reduce the growth of waste-water and nuclear waste to more manageable levels.|$|E

The program goal is to introduce a smart <b>filter</b> <b>system</b> to supervise its operation and to assure its system reliability.

40|$|Two advanced, hot gas, barrier <b>filter</b> <b>system</b> {{concepts}} {{have been}} proposed by the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation to improve the reliability and availability of barrier <b>filter</b> <b>systems</b> in applications such as PFBC and IGCC power generation. The two hot gas, barrier <b>filter</b> <b>system</b> concepts, the inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>system</b> and the sheet <b>filter</b> <b>system,</b> were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable barrier <b>filter</b> <b>systems.</b> The program {{results show that the}} inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>system</b> has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier <b>filter</b> <b>system.</b> Some types of thin-walled, standard candle filter elements can be used directly as inverted candle filter elements, {{and the development of a}} new type of filter element is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of inverted candle filter elements were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted candle filter elements, and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted candle filter elements are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>system</b> is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle <b>filter</b> <b>system,</b> the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>system</b> is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle <b>filter</b> <b>system.</b> Improved hot gas, barrier <b>filter</b> <b>system</b> availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>system</b> is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of sheet filter elements were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina sheet filter element is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic sheet filter element may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic sheet filter elements could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the sheet <b>filter</b> <b>system</b> is comparable to the capital cost of the standard candle <b>filter</b> <b>system,</b> although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of sheet filter element manufacturing has not been established. The development of the sheet <b>filter</b> <b>system</b> could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard candle <b>filter</b> <b>system,</b> but not as high as that of the inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>system.</b> The sheet <b>filter</b> <b>system</b> has not reached the same level of development as the inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>system,</b> and it will require more design development, filter element fabrication development, small-scale testing and evaluation before larger-scale testing could be recommended...|$|R

500|$|Without {{an atomic}} line filter, laser {{tracking}} and communication may be difficult. Usually, intensified charge-coupled device cameras {{must be used}} in conjunction with simple dielectric optical filters (e.g. interference filters) to detect laser emissions at a distance.

With the superior <b>filtering</b> <b>system</b> of an ALF, a non-intensified CCD may be used with a continuous wave laser more efficiently.

The vehicles based on the chassis include an armoured recovery vehicle, a bridgelayer, a self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle, a tactical nuclear missile launcher and a self-propelled artillery piece.|$|E

There is no evidence in well-preserved fossils {{for the opening of}} a venom gland, thus trigonotarbids were probably not venomous. The chelicerae may have been slightly retractable into the prosoma.

2500|$|The [...] "oyster-tecture" [...] {{movement}} {{promotes the}} use of oyster reefs for water purification and wave attenuation. [...] An oyster-tecture project has been implemented at Withers Estuary, Withers Swash, South Carolina, by Neil Chambers-led volunteers, at a site where pollution was affecting beach tourism. Currently, for the installation cost of $3000, roughly 4.8 million liters of water are being filtered daily. In New Jersey, however, the Department of Environmental Protection refused to allow oysters as a <b>filtering</b> <b>system</b> in Sandy Hook Bay and the Raritan Bay, citing worries that commercial shellfish growers would be at risk and {{that members of the}} public might disregard warnings and consume tainted oysters. New Jersey Baykeepers responded by changing their strategy for utilizing oysters to clean up the waterway, by partnering with Naval Weapons Station Earle. The Navy station is under 24/7 security and therefore eliminates any poaching and associated human health risk.
