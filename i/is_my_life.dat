Millar wrote the introduction for a reissue of Simpson's autobiography, Cycling <b>is</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life,</b> published in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Johns was {{a popular}} member of the cast of The Footy Show, and played several {{characters}} for the show. He further developed the Reg Reagan character as a beer-swilling rugby league fan, and the character became hugely popular. He also appeared as Trent, a gay flight attendant. In 2004, Johns recorded a novelty song and wrote a book, This <b>Is</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> in character as Reg Reagan, and produced a DVD featuring both characters. He also commentated on Nine's telecasts of rugby league games. In 2008, he wrote a second book, From the Sheds, under his own name. He also became assistant coach of the Melbourne Storm NRL team.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} as a player, Cousy {{published his}} autobiography Basketball <b>Is</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> in 1963, {{and in the}} same year became coach at Boston College. In the 1965 ECAC Holiday Basketball Festival at Madison Square Garden, Providence defeated Boston College 91-86 in the title game, when the Friars were led by Tourney MVP and All-American Jimmy Walker. Providence was coached by Joe Mullaney, who was Cousy's teammate at Holy Cross when the two men were players there in 1947. In his six seasons there, he had a record of 117 wins and 38 losses and was named New England Coach of the Year for 1968 and 1969. Cousy led the Eagles to three NIT appearances, including a berth in the 1969 NIT Championship and two National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments, including the 1967 Eastern Regional Finals.|$|E

5|$|Ray Pascoe, a fan, {{made the}} 1995 film Something To Aim At, a project he {{began in the}} years {{following}} Simpson's death; the film includes interviews with those closest to Simpson. The 2005 documentary Wheels Within Wheels follows actor Simon Dutton as he searches for people and places in Simpson's life. Dutton's four-year project chronicles the midlife crisis that sparked his quest to rediscover Simpson. British rider David Millar won stage twelve of the 2012 Tour de France on the 45th anniversary of Simpson's death; previously banned from cycling for using performance-enhancing drugs, he paid tribute to Simpson and reinforced the importance of learning from his– and Simpson's– mistakes. Millar wrote the introduction for a reissue of Simpson's autobiography, Cycling <b>is</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life,</b> published in 2009. In 2010, Simpson was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame. He inspired Simpson Magazine, which began in March 2013. According to the magazine's creators, “It was Simpson's spirit and style, his legendary tenacity and his ability to suffer that endeared him to cycling fans everywhere as much as the trophies he won”.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the war, Hutton worked for a paper manufacturer, but writing and journalism {{provided}} a more permanent career. Hutton worked with Thomas Moult, a journalist and writer, to produce a book of memoirs, Cricket <b>is</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> in 1949, and he wrote for the News of the World while still playing. Following his cricketing retirement, Hutton worked in broadcasting until 1961, and after 1955, he wrote for the London Evening News until 1963. A second book, Just my story, followed in 1956 in collaboration with journalist, R. J. Hayter. In 1958–59, Hutton travelled to Australia to cover the MCC tour as correspondent for the Evening News, again assisted by a professional journalist, while between 1963 and 1986, he wrote for The Observer. He wrote a third book, Thirty Years in Cricket, in 1984. Hutton's increasing commitments {{in the south of}} England meant he moved to North London in 1959. In 1960, Hutton was invited to join the engineering firm of J. H. Fenner, mainly working in a public relations capacity. Later, he moved into marketing and overseas promotion of products, became a director of the firm in 1973, and retired in 1984.|$|E
500|$|Typically {{cast as a}} [...] "woman who is supportive, {{sympathetic}} or self-effacingly funny", Kavner grew {{to dislike}} playing such roles.

Kavner has also appeared in live-action roles in seven films written by Woody Allen, and in the Adam Sandler comedy Click.|$|E

[...] Boudreau has said, [...] "You are never going to find a guy that cares more than Brooks Laich." [...] Laich spends time in the off-season with a power skating instructor, which he feels is key to a long career.|$|E
500|$|Many of Kavner's roles {{have been}} {{described}} by New York Times writer Hilary de Vries as a [...] "woman who is supportive, sympathetic, or self-effacingly funny". Kavner grew to despise playing such roles, saying, [...] "If it smacks of Brenda Morgenstern, I won't take the job." [...] She had a supporting role as Eleanor Costello, a nurse who befriends Robin Williams' character in the Academy Award nominated film Awakenings. Kavner interviewed several nurses {{in preparation for the}} role, and Penny Marshall, the director of the film, described Kavner as [...] "a low-maintenance actor [...] You {{never have to worry about}} giving [...] back-story for her characters." [...] In 1992, Kavner starred in This <b>Is</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life,</b> her first leading role in a feature film. Kavner played Dottie Ingels, an aspiring stand-up comedian who starts neglecting her family when her career begins to take off. Kavner described Dottie as [...] "really selfish" [...] but admitted, [...] "I liked the role for that very reason." [...] Kavner had been asked to play a character with a smaller role in the film, but Joe Roth, at the time the chairman of 20th Century Fox, suggested that they cast a lesser known actress in the lead role. Nora Ephron, the writer of This <b>Is</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life,</b> said Kavner [...] "has so little vanity that it is almost shocking. Not only does she have no demands as an actress - 'How big is my trailer, what's in my refrigerator?' - but she will do anything for the character if it makes sense to her." ...|$|E

500|$|Simpson spoke fluent French, also {{competent}} Flemish and Italian. He {{was interested}} in vintage cars, and his driving and riding styles were similar; Helen remembered, [...] "Driving through the West End of London at , was nothing." [...] In January 1966, Simpson was a guest [...] "castaway" [...] on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs; his favourite musical piece was [...] "Ari's Theme" [...] from Exodus by the London Festival Orchestra, his book choice was The Pickwick Papers and his luxury item was golf equipment. Helen said that she chose his records for the show, since he {{was not interested in}} music. Simpson's autobiography, Cycling <b>Is</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life,</b> was first published in 1966.|$|E
500|$|... "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is a pop and electropop song. In an {{interview}} with AP Entertainment, the singer stated that the song's lyrics describe her behaviour during the time she wrote it, when she was devastated and trying to overcome a former relationship. She also remarked that the main theme of [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is the suffering she experienced despite her attempts to numb the pain. Echoing this thought, Lo further confessed that: [...] "I can't lie. What I'm singing about <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> It's the truth. I've had moments where [...] has been a bigger part than it should be. It's hard to admit to, and I could filter it or find another metaphor for it – but it doesn't feel right to me." ...|$|E
500|$|While Deangelo gets {{annoyed with}} Jim and Pam, {{he loves the}} antics of Andy, who has resorted to {{physical}} comedy when his jokes fall flat, {{getting to the point}} where he pours hot coffee on his pants and (at Deangelo's urging) eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> now". Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the [...] "multipurpose room", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.|$|E
