500|$|The filming {{schedule}} {{spanned the}} winter and summer, commencing in early January and finishing in mid-June. This was physically challenging for many, with the temperatures ranging from [...] The actors had to drink frequently {{and sit in the}} shade. The schedule was strict. The day began at 6am, changing into costumes and getting onto the actors' bus, which took them to the sets in Kanuria. The actors, including Aamir, all travelled on the same bus. If anyone missed it, it was up to them to reach the sets. One day, Aamir was late and missed the actors' bus. That day, his wife Reena, the executive producer, reprimanded him for being late. She told him he had to set an example {{for the rest of the}} crew. [...] "If he started coming late, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> tell the others to come on time?" [...] While on the sets, the actors were given call sheets with the day's timetable such as breakfast, hair styling, make-up, costumes, etc.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Piece of Me" [...] was filmed on November 27 and November 28, 2007, at the nightclub and {{restaurant}} Social Hollywood in Los Angeles, California. It {{was directed by}} Wayne Isham, who had previously worked with Spears on the music video of [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman". British national newspaper Daily Mail reported that the video cost $500,000, her most expensive music video since the music video for [...] "Toxic". In some scenes of the music video, Spears wore a purple satin dress from American designer Marina Toybina. Spears reportedly arrived twelve hours late to the set, after spending the day with her sons Sean Preston and Jayden James. Isham talked about the situation, saying, [...] "She was late. People made a big thing about it, [...] <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> not be late, when you have 50, 65, 75 people running down the street chasing her car? That was a long day for the crew. It was literally a 20-hour day for the crew. She {{was there for the}} last six hours of it. She got there late, showed up and just kicked ass". He also explained the concept of the music video: ...|$|E
2500|$|On 28 May, {{they heard}} that the Belgian army was surrendering. [...] General Réquin spoke to Mrs Spears and {{emphasised}} the serious of the military situation.

[...] She resisted – <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> leave her unit at a time like this? [...] Spears was insistent but she was reluctant, as was Captain Gosset, who feared the road might be cut and that she would be unable to get back. [...] They heard that Dunkirk had been evacuated. [...] Then Spears rang again – this time ordering her to come to Paris. [...] She decided to make a dash to the capital and back. [...] They met at the British embassy. [...] With the French army collapsing on all fronts, Spears was exhausted. 'His eyes were bloodshot. [...] There were lines inches deep in his face. [...] I saw for one second what was going to happen. [...] The war leapt at me out of his eyes. [...] I was terrified.' ...|$|E

2500|$|Bishop did not {{see herself}} as a [...] "lesbian poet" [...] or as a [...] "female poet". Because she refused to have her work {{published}} in all-female poetry anthologies, other female poets involved with the women's movement thought she was hostile towards the movement. For instance, a student at Harvard who was close to Bishop in the 60s, Kathleen Spivack, wrote in her memoir, [...] "I think Bishop internalized the misogyny of the time. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> not? ... Bishop had a very ambivalent relation to being a woman plus poet—plus lesbian—in the Boston/Cambridge/Harvard nexus ... Extremely vulnerable, sensitive, she hid much of her private life. She {{wanted nothing to do}} with anything that seemed to involve the women's movement. She internalized many of the male attitudes of the day toward women, who were supposed to be attractive, appealing to men, and not ask for equal pay or a job with benefits." [...] However, this was not how Bishop necessarily viewed herself. In an interview with The Paris Review from 1978, she said that, despite her insistence on being excluded from female poetry anthologies, she still considered herself to be [...] "a strong feminist" [...] but that she only wanted to be judged based on the quality of her writing and not on her gender or sexual orientation.|$|E
2500|$|Yates claimed that, {{despite his}} urging to check her medical records for prior treatment, Dr. Saeed {{had refused to}} {{continue}} her regimen of the antipsychotic Haldol, the treatment that had worked for her during her first breakdown in 1999."The real question to me is: <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> have been so ill and the medical community not diagnose her, not treat her, and obviously not protect our family from her...Rusty testified that he never {{knew that she had}} visions and voices; he said he never knew she had considered killing the children. Neither did Dr. Saeed, even though the delusions could have been found in medical records from 1999 ... he reluctantly prescribed Haldol, the same drug that worked in a drug cocktail for her in 1999. But after a few weeks, he took her off the drug, citing his concerns about side effects ... though her condition seemed to be worsening two days before the drownings, when Rusty drove her to Dr. Saeed's office, he testified, the doctor refused to try Haldol longer or return her to the hospital" [...] He added that his wife was too sick to be discharged from her last stay in the hospital in May 2001. He said he noticed the staff lower their heads as if in shame and embarrassment, turning away without saying a word. The hospital had no other choice due to the ten-day psychiatric hospitalization insurance constraints of their provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield, subcontracted by Magellan Health Services.|$|E
2500|$|Sackveille-West's novel Challenge also bears {{witness to}} her affair with Trefusis: Sackville-West and Trefusis had started {{writing this book}} as a {{collaborative}} endeavour, and the male character's name, Julian, had been Sackville-West's nickname when passing as a man. Challenge is a roman à clef with the character of Julian being only a male version of Sackville-West and Eve, the woman he desires so passionately is Trefusis. Notably, Sackville-West in Challenge defends Trefusis against several of the insults Nicolson had applied to her in his letters to her; for example Nicolson often called Trefussis a [...] "swine" [...] and a [...] "pig", and in the book Julian goes {{out of his way}} to say that Eve is neither a swine nor a pig. In the book, Julian says that [...] "Eve is not a 'little swine', she just has the weaknesses and faults of femininity carried to the 9th degree, but is also redeemed by a self-sacrifice, which is very feminine". Reflecting her obsession with the Romany people, Eve is portrayed as a seductive Romany woman with an [...] "insinuating femininity" [...] that Julian cannot resist, calling him away from his political mission of winning independence on a fictional Greek island during the Greek war of independence. [...] Nicolson wrote in a letter to his wife: [...] "Don't please dedicate it to Violet, it would kill me if you did". When Challenge was published in 1924, the dedication was written in Romany reading: [...] "This book is yours, honored witch. If you read it, you will find your tormented soul changed and free". Throughout their relationship, Trefusis was given to threatening suicide if Sackville-West left her, a character trait shared by Eve, who finally attempts to drown herself in the sea while Julian tries to come to her rescue. As Eve changes her mind about taking her life and tries to swim ashore as Julian swims out to her, it is too late and she is swept away by the tide to drown. The book's ending reflected Sackville-West's guilt about breaking her relationship with Trefusis. Her mother, Lady Sackville, found the portrayal obvious enough to refuse to allow publication of the novel in England; but Vita's son Nigel Nicolson (1973, p.194) praises his mother: [...] "She fought for the right to love, men and women, rejecting the conventions that marriage demands exclusive love, and that women should love only men, and men only women. For this she was prepared to give up everything… <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> regret that the knowledge of it should now reach the ears of a new generation, one so infinitely more compassionate than her own?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Not for {{a moment}} was there a look of {{forgiveness}} in her eye, or a sign of pardon in the lines of her face. But in her heart there was a contest.
