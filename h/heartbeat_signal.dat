40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. A sudden {{unexpected}} death during epilepsy (SUDEP) {{can occur}} to an unattended epilepsy sufferer. The cessation {{of heart and}} breathing activity is associated with SUDEP. Therefore, developing a heart and breathing monitoring system that could alarm when an epilepsy patient experiences cessation of heart or breathing activity is necessary. This system will assist healthcare providers {{to respond to the}} emergency and prevent sudden death. This collaborative project is to investigate the feasibility of developing a miniature, unobtrusive, and self-contained module that an epilepsy patient could wear in bed and a small bedside alarm unit intended to alert healthcare providers to prevent SUDEP. The wearable unit communicates wirelessly occurrences of breaths and heartbeats to the bedside unit. The bedside unit alerts upon cessation of heart or breathing activity. This project assumed that the monitor receives an input voltage from a small strip of piezoelectric film made of polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) attached to the patient???s chest. The PVDF sensor voltage changes in response both to the chest expansion and contraction of breathing and to the chest vibrations caused by heartbeats. In the first stage of this project, human subject recordings of PVDF, strain-gauge plethysmography (SPG),and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals were analyzed to determine how to design the signal processing needed to separate out individual breathing and <b>heartbeat</b> <b>signals.</b> Then, low-power analog, microcontroller, and wireless technologies were used to build a prototype of the wearable module to separate out the breathing and <b>heartbeat</b> <b>signals,</b> detect individual breaths and heartbeats, and telemeter the detected breaths and heartbeats to the bedside unit. A prototype of the bedside unit was built using similar technologies to receive the occurrences of heartbeats and breaths from the wearable module. This unit also calculates heart and breathing rates and determines whether or not to alarm if breaths or heartbeats cease or the wireless link fails to function. For convenience, the wearable module and bedside unit were prototyped using bread-boarded circuitry and commercial development boards containing the miniature electronic components. Once feasibility is shown, the wearable module and bedside unit can be compacted by incorporating the miniature electronic components directly into custom integrated circuits. The performance of the signal processing algorithm to separate out breathing and <b>heartbeat</b> <b>signals</b> and to detect individual breaths and heartbeats was tested by using the algorithm to process PVDF recordings from human subjects and comparing the results with SPG recordings of breaths and PPG recordings of heartbeats from the same human subjects. Miss Swetha Seshu Ayyagari designed the hardware for the signal conditioning circuit and the software for digital signal processing to separate out the breathing and <b>heartbeat</b> <b>signals</b> from the PVDF signal. Mr. Pritam Rajendra Chopda designed the software to detect individual breaths and heartbeats, transmit detected breaths and heartbeats to the bedside unit, calculate heart and breathing rate, and alert upon cessation of heartbeats or breathing or wireless link failure. Prototypes were successfully built of the wearable module and bedside unit. The prototype wearable module was capable of processing an incoming PVDF signal, separating out breathing and <b>heartbeat</b> <b>signals,</b> detecting individual breaths and heartbeats, and wirelessly transmitting them to the bedside unit.

Biosensor is built on the vehicle steering wheel to measure driver’s <b>heartbeat</b> <b>signals.</b> Heart rate variability (HRV), a physiological signal that has established links to waking/sleepiness stages, thus can be analyzed from the pulse signals for the detection of driver drowsiness. The novel design of measuring <b>heartbeat</b> <b>signals</b> from biosensors on the steering wheel and seatback makes this drowsiness detection system one with almost no annoyance to the driver, and the use of this physiological signal can ensure the accuracy of drowsiness detection.

However, this design requires the driver put both hands on the steering wheel to measure the heart rate. In Phase II, a new biosensor is designed that can measure heart rate even when only one hand is on the steering wheel, which happens very often in real driving situations.

40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} {{the prototype of}} a new stethoscope using laser technology to make the heart-beat signal “visible”. This heartbeat detection technique could overcome the limitation of the acoustic stethoscope brought by the poor ability of human ear to hear low frequency heart sounds.

Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of the acoustic stethoscope is also very sensitive to noise from immediate environment. In the prototype of laser-based stethoscope, the <b>heartbeat</b> <b>signal</b> is correlated to the optical spot of a laser beam reflected from a thin mirror attached to the patient’s chest skin.

"December 2011 "Sleep monitoring of heartbeat, respiration and restlessness can help to detect sleep disturbances which may be indicative of poor health and functional deficits, especially in older adults. This work investigates a new hydraulic bed transducer configuration in order to improve its ability to capture <b>heartbeat</b> <b>signals</b> from different body types and proposes a new approach for detecting heartbeats from a ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal using the k-means clustering algorithm. The system's ability to capture <b>heartbeat</b> <b>signals</b> was improved by increasing the sensitivity of the transducer, varying its length, volume of water, and positioning. The transducer placement experiments were conducted on two participants based on two criteria: 1) Visual observation of the transducer signal to verify the occurrence of heartbeats in the BCG signal, and 2) A reliability index based on the percentage of heartbeats effectively detected by the system. Additional testing on a diverse group of six participants (ranging in age and body type) was performed to validate the transducer arrangement proposed. Results showed that the system was able to capture the occurrence of heartbeats for seven out of eight participants. The BCG signals captured by the new transducer arrangement were tested to explore a new approach for detecting individual heartbeats using the k-means clustering algorithm and features extracted from the BCG signal. The performance criteria used in the evaluation was the percentage of correct detection of heartbeats derived from the confusion matrix. The percentage of correct detection for five ballistocardiogram signals acquired from different body types, tested in the laboratory setting with a coil spring mattress were in the range of 91. X% to 99. 7 %. When tested in residential living with an air mattress, the results were 83. 3 % which indicate the need for further investigation in feature selection and machine learning.

The first method explores matrices arising from networks of transitions constructed following events {{represented by a}} time series.

Both methods provide estimators of dynamical aspects of short-term <b>heartbeat</b> <b>signals</b> obtained from nocturnal Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of healthy people of different ages and genders. The deceleration capacity, arising from the adjacency matrix of the network, and the entropy rate, resulting from the transition matrix of the network, are also calculated, and both significantly decay with aging.

All of these estimators describe in a consistent way changes in the beat-to-beat heart period dynamics caused by aging. An overall slowing down of heart period changes is observed, and an increase of permutation entropy results from the progressive increase of patterns with repeated values.
