5|$|An air-cuticle {{multilayer}} in {{the scales}} creates optical interference. <b>Each</b> <b>scale</b> contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that {{hold them in}} place and maintain an air gap between them. The layers and air gaps are narrower than the wavelength of visible light. The structure varies from one layer at the proximal end of <b>each</b> <b>scale,</b> to about six layers at the distal end. This multilayer structure strongly reflects certain wavelengths of light, which {{are determined by the}} thicknesses of the layers and the angle at which the light hits the scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales are}} highly curved, which creates inter-scale reflection. This {{mechanism}} is unusual among Lepidoptera. The proximal part of <b>each</b> <b>scale</b> is almost flat; the scale then gradually curves {{up and then}} steeply bends down at the distal end, covering the proximal part of the next row of scales. Because of this shape, adjacent rows of scales have valley-like grooves between them. This allows light to strike one scale, reflect at a roughly 90° angle, strike the next scale, and be reflected away from the wing. Because the angle of each reflection is far from normal incidence, the interference effect favours reflection of different colours of light than are seen when light strikes {{near the top of}} the curved part of the scale.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, the Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale was introduced. It {{was made}} for three {{different}} age groups. The AMAS takes into account age-related situations that affect an individual's anxiety. The divisions include one scale for adults (AMA-A), one scale for college students (AMAS-C), {{and the other for}} the elderly population (AMAS-E). <b>Each</b> <b>scale</b> is geared towards examining situations specific to that age group. For example, the AMAS-C has items pertaining specifically to college students, such as questions about anxiety of the future. The AMAS-A is geared more toward mid-life issues, and the AMAS-E has specific anxieties the older population deals with, such as fear of aging and dying. The AMAS-A contains 36 items. It has 14 questions relating to worry/oversensitivity, 9 questions about physiological anxiety, 7 questions about social concerns/stress, and 6 questions about lies. An example of an age appropriate item for this scale is, “I am worried about my job performance”. The AMAS-C contains 49 items about the same topics, but incorporates 15 items related specifically to test anxiety. Questions relating to the items on this scale include, “I worry too much about tests and exams”. This scale is similar in structure to the CMAS discussed above. The AMAS-E contains 44 items related to worry/oversensitivity, physiological anxiety, lying, and the fear of aging. Twenty- three of the questions on the AMAS-E are related to worry/oversensitivity, but The Fear of Aging category of this scale includes items such as, “I worry about becoming senile”. Similar to the TMAS, the AMAS can be given in a group or individual setting, and the person responds either yes or no to each item listed according to if it pertains to themselves or not. The more items that are answered yes, suggest a higher level of anxiety. The scale has been said to be easy to complete and practical, because it takes only about 10 minutes to complete and just a couple minutes to score.|$|E

2500|$|A wavelet is a {{mathematical}} function used to divide a given function or continuous-time signal into different scale components.

Wavelet transforms have advantages over traditional Fourier transforms for representing functions that have discontinuities and sharp peaks, and for accurately deconstructing and reconstructing finite, non-periodic and/or non-stationary signals.|$|E

2500|$|As {{described}} in the [...] section, Isabel Myers considered {{the direction of the}} preference (for example, E vs. I) to be more important than the degree of the preference. Statistically, this would mean that scores on each MBTI scale would show a bimodal distribution with most people scoring near the ends of the scales, thus dividing people into either, e.g., an extraverted or an introverted psychological type. However, most studies have found that scores on the individual scales were actually distributed in a centrally peaked manner, similar to a normal distribution, indicating that the majority of people were actually {{in the middle of the}} scale and were thus neither clearly introverted nor extraverted. Most personality traits do show a normal distribution of scores from low to high, with about 15% of people at the low end, about 15% at the high end and the majority of people in the middle ranges. But in order for the MBTI to be scored, a cut-off line is used at the middle of <b>each</b> <b>scale</b> and all those scoring below the line are classified as a low type and those scoring above the line are given the opposite type. Thus, psychometric assessment research fails to support the concept of type, but rather shows that most people lie near the middle of a continuous curve. [...] "Although we do not conclude that the absence of bimodality necessarily proves that the MBTI developers' theory-based assumption of categorical [...] "types" [...] of personality is invalid, the absence of empirical bimodality in IRT-based research of MBTI scores does indeed remove a potentially powerful line of evidence that was previously available to [...] "type" [...] advocates to cite in defense of their position." ...|$|E
