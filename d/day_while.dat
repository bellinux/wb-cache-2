5|$|A given flower is {{open only}} for a single day, opening before dawn and closing in the afternoon. Flowers are self-fecundating and protogynous (with female parts {{maturing}} first), and will self-pollinate if {{they have not been}} pollinated by insects during the <b>day.</b> <b>While</b> many insects visit the flowers, only some bees actually accomplish pollination. V.thapsus flowering period lasts from June to August in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates. Visitors include halictid bees and hoverflies. The hair on lower stamens may serve to provide footholds for visitors.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a <b>day,</b> <b>while</b> 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E

On the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Harvey. Due to initially strong wind shear, Harvey exhibited subtropical characteristics.|$|E
