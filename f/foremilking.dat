40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{survey of}} 523 dairy {{farms in the}} south of Chile was carried out to quantify risk factors associated with bulk-milk somatic-cell count (BMSCC) > 200 x 10 (3) cells/ml. Questionnaires followed by one reminder were sent to 3710 dairy farms via the 11 milk-processing plants that they supplied in October 1998. The response proportion was 14. 1 %. The median BMSCC was 289 x 10 (3) cells/ml (range: 74 x 10 (3) to 1800 x 10 (3) cells/ml). The median herd size was 70 cows (range: 7 - 616); herd size was not associated with BMSCC. The annual milk yield of 33. 2 % of the herds was 200 x 10 (3) cells/ml was more likely when <b>foremilking</b> was practised, and when cows were collected in a yard before milking. BMSCC was less likely to be > 200 x 10 (3) cells/ml when teats were washed with water containing disinfectant compared with plain water; when the udder and teats were always checked before milking compared with, sometimes or never; when cows with mastitis were milked first compared with any other ordering, and when farmers recorded individual-cow somatic-cell count (ICSCC) compared with when ICSCC was not recorded.

40|$|Determination of {{somatic cell}} count (SCC) is used {{worldwide}} in dairy practice {{to describe the}} hygienic status of the milk and the udder health of cows. When SCC is tested on a quarter level to detect single quarters with high SCC levels of cows for practical reasons, mostly <b>foremilk</b> samples after prestimulation (i. e. cleaning of the udder) are used. However, SCC is usually different in different milk fractions. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} study was the investigation of the use of <b>foremilk</b> samples for the estimation of total quarter SCC. A total of 378 milkings in 19 dairy cows were performed with a special milking device to drain quarter milk separately. <b>Foremilk</b> samples were taken after udder stimulation and before cluster attachment. SCC was measured in <b>foremilk</b> samples and in total quarter milk. Total quarter milk SCC could not be predicted precisely from <b>foremilk</b> SCC measurements. At relatively high <b>foremilk</b> SCC levels (> 300 × 103 cells/ml) <b>foremilk</b> SCC were higher than total quarter milk. At around (50 - 300) × 103 cells/ml <b>foremilk</b> and total quarter SCC did not differ considerably. Most interestingly, if <b>foremilk</b> SCC was lower than 50 × 103 cells/ml the total quarter SCC was higher than <b>foremilk</b> SCC. In addition, individual cows showed dramatic variations in <b>foremilk</b> SCC that were not very well related to total quarter milk SCC. In conclusion, <b>foremilk</b> samples are useful to detect high quarter milk SCC to recognize possibly infected quarters, only if precise cell counts are not required. However, <b>foremilk</b> samples can be deceptive if very low cell numbers are to be detecte...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It {{is known}} that the fat content of breast milk is higher in hindmilk than in <b>foremilk.</b> However, {{it has not been}} {{determined}} if this increased fat content results from {{an increase in the number}} of milk fat globules (MFGs), an increase in the size of MFGs, or both. This study aims to determine which factor plays the most important role. Methods Thirteen breastfeeding mothers were enrolled in the study and we obtained 52 samples from 26 breasts before (<b>foremilk)</b> and after (hindmilk) a breastfeeding session. The fat content was evaluated by creamatocrit (CrCt) values. MFG size was measured with the laser light scattering method. We compared CrCt values and MFG size between <b>foremilk</b> and hindmilk. Results Although the CrCt values were higher in the hindmilk (8. 6 ± 3. 6 %) than in the <b>foremilk</b> (3. 7 ± 1. 7 %), the MFG size did not change (4. 2 ± 1. 0 μm and 4. 6 ± 2. 1 μm, <b>foremilk</b> and hindmilk, respectively). There was no relationship between the changes in CrCt versus MFG size from <b>foremilk</b> to hindmilk. Conclusion The results indicate that the increase in fat content results mainly from the increased number of MFGs, which may be released into the milk flow as the mammary lobe becomes progressively emptied. </p...|$|R
40|$|Human milk {{contains}} active proteases that initiate hydrolysis of {{milk proteins}} within the mammary gland. Milk expressed {{at the beginning}} of feeding is known as <b>foremilk</b> and {{that at the end of}} feeding is known as hindmilk. As hindmilk contains higher fat, vitamins A and E, and higher calories than <b>foremilk,</b> feeding only hindmilk initially and reserving <b>foremilk</b> for later are practiced in some neonatal intensive care units. This study investigated the difference in peptide profiles, predicted milk protease activities, and bioactive peptides between <b>foremilk</b> and hindmilk. Bioactive peptides are short fragments of proteins that influence biological processes. Four mothers pumped 10 [*]mL of their <b>foremilk</b> and 10 [*]mL of their hindmilk into iced containers prepared with antiproteases and the samples were immediately frozen. The peptide profile of each sample was analyzed by liquid chromatography nano-electrospray ionization Orbitrap Fusion tandem mass spectrometry. Peptide abundance (sum of ion intensities) and count (number of unique peptide sequences) in each milk sample were determined from this analysis. The specific enzymes that participated in peptide release were predicted based on the amino acids positioned at each cleavage site. Peptide bioactivity was predicted based on homology to a known functional peptide database and two bioactivity prediction algorithms. Hindmilk contained a higher count of peptides than <b>foremilk.</b> The higher number of unique peptide sequences in hindmilk was related to hydrolysis of β-casein, osteopontin, αs 1 -casein and mucin- 1 via plasmin and elastase cleavage, and possible aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase activities. Though hindmilk contained a greater number of peptides than <b>foremilk,</b> the overall peptide abundance did not differ and most of the total peptide abundance derived from peptide sequences that were present in both milk types. The presence of higher numbers of predicted bioactive peptides in the hindmilk could indicate that the practice of providing hindmilk rather than <b>foremilk</b> to premature infants could positively impact health outcomes; however, as there are few differences in overall peptide abundance, the overall effect is likely limited...|$|R

We also aimed to describe the change in breast milk hormone concentration within each feed, and over time. Mothers were recruited from the postpartum ward at a university hospital in London. Breast milk samples were collected at the participants homes. We recruited 120 healthy, primiparous, breastfeeding mothers, aged over 18  years. Mothers who smoked, had multiple births or had diabetes were excluded. <b>Foremilk</b> and hindmilk samples were collected from 105 women at 1  week postpartum and 92 women at 3  months postpartum. We recorded maternal and infant anthropometric measurements at each sample collection and measured hormone concentrations using a multiplex assay. The concentration of leptin in <b>foremilk</b> correlated with maternal BMI at the time of sample collection, at 7  days (r= 0. 31, p= 0. 02) and 3  months postpartum (r= 0. 30, p=< 0. 00). <b>Foremilk</b> insulin correlated with maternal BMI at 3  months postpartum (r= 0. 22, p= 0. 04).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the changes in somatic cell counts (SCC) in different fractions of milk, with special emphasis on the <b>foremilk</b> and cisternal milk fractions. Therefore, in Experiment 1, quarter milk samples were defined as strict <b>foremilk</b> (F), cisternal milk (C), first 400 g of alveolar milk (A 1), and the remaining alveolar milk (A 2). Experiment 2 included 6 <b>foremilk</b> fractions (F 1 to F 6), consisting of one hand-stripped milk jet each, and the remaining cisternal milk plus the entire alveolar milk (RM). In Experiment 1, changes during milking indicated {{the importance of the}} sampled milk fraction for measuring SCC because the decrease in the first 3 fractions (F, C, and A 1) was enormous in milk with high total quarter SCC. The decline in SCC from F to C was 50 % and was 80 % from C to A 1. Total quarter SCC presented a value of approximately 20 % of SCC in F or 35 % of SCC in C. Changes in milk with low or very low SCC were marginal during milking. Fractions F and C showed significant differences in SCC among different total SCC concentrations. These differences disappeared with the alveolar fractions A 1 and A 2. In Experiment 2, a more detailed investigation of <b>foremilk</b> fractions supported the findings of Experiment 1. A significant decline in the <b>foremilk</b> fractions even of F 1 to F 6 was observed in high-SCC milk at concentrations > 350 x 10 (3) cells/mL. Although one of these <b>foremilk</b> fractions presented only 0. 1 to 0. 2 % of the total milk, the SCC was 2 - to 3 -fold greater than the total quarter milk SCC. Because the trait of interest (SCC) was measured directly by using the DeLaval cell counter (DCC), the quality of measurement was tested. Statistically interesting factors (repeatability, recovery rate, and potential matrix effects of milk) proved that the DCC is a useful tool for identifying the SCC of milk samples, and thus of grading udder health status. Generally, the DCC provides reliable results, but one must consider that SCC even in strict <b>foremilk</b> can differ dramatically from SCC in the total cisternal fraction, and thus also from SCC in the alveolar fraction...|$|R

40|$|The current {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} look at the impact of differing pre-milking routines on milking time parameters, milk quality and oxytocin profiles. All {{experiments were}} performed on Holstein cows milked 3 X daily and producing 13 - 16 Kg/milking. Lag times of 0, 60, 90, 120 and 240 s along with forestripping or not forestripping were applied to 786 Holstein cows. Cows in early to mid-lactation had the highest milk yield in the first 2 min when lag time was 60 s and forestripping was included; however, lag time or forestripping had no impact on unit on-time for early to mid-lactation cows. The combination of forestripping with lag times of 90 and 120 s increased the amount of milk harvested in the first 2 min to > 60 % of the total and of milk and lag times beyond 60 s reduced milking unit on-time for late-lactation cows independent of forestripping. The quantity and quality of <b>foremilk</b> was analyzed to evaluate the relationship between <b>foremilk</b> and harvested milk plate loop count (PLC) and somatic cell count (SCC). The SCC and PLC of <b>foremilk</b> were not good predictors of the SCC and PLC in the harvested milk fraction. The <b>foremilk</b> represents 0. 12 % of the total milk harvested and the somatic cells and bacteria found in the <b>foremilk</b> represent < 0. 28 % and 1. 44 % of the total somatic cells and bacteria in milk. Manual stimulation, no stimulation and mechanical stimulation by increased cycle pulsation (300 cycles/min) with low vacuum were included as treatments to analyze their impact on oxytocin profiles and milking parameters. Increased cycle pulsation elicits a similar oxytocin profile to that of cows which were subjected to manual stimulation. Proper cleaning of the teats and detection of mastitis during mechanical stimulation needs further investigation in regard to identification of abnormal milk in real-time and by mechanical means...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{intentions}} of dairy farmers towards mastitis control is important to design effective udder health control programs. We used the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to explore {{the intentions}} of North-Western Ethiopian dairy farmers towards implementing non-specified mastitis control measures (nsMCMs) and towards implementing 4 specific MCMs. Face to face interviews were held with 134 dairy farmers to study associations between their intentions and any of three factors (attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control) that, according to the TPB, determine intentions. The majority of the farmers (93 %) had a positive intention to implement nsMCMs, whereas a smaller majority of farmers had the intention to implement the specific MCMs to improve udder cleaning (87 %), to improve stall hygiene (78 %), to improve feeding of cows (76 %), and to perform <b>foremilk</b> stripping (74 %). Farmers had a more positive attitude, but lower subjective norm and lower perceived behavioural control towards implementing nsMCMs compared with implementing most specific MCMs, although the subjective norms for stall hygiene and perceived behavioural control for improving feeding of cows were also low. Attitude was positively associated with intentions to implement nsMCMs, to improve cleaning of the udders, to improve stall hygiene and to implement <b>foremilk</b> stripping. Both the intention to improve udder cleaning and to implement <b>foremilk</b> stripping, were positively associated to subjective norms towards these MCMs. Our data can help tailor intervention programs aiming to increase the intention of Ethiopian dairy farmers to implement MCMs and thus to improve udder health in this country.

40|$|Human {{breast milk}} is a {{complicated}} mixture of essential nutrients delivered in a systematic time release fashion to maximize absorption while minimizing gastrointestinal discomfort in the child. During {{the first few days}} of milk let down colostrum is the predominant mixture – high in protein, immunoglobulins, and low in carbohydrate and fat. Once milk production is established and regular by day 3 - 4 the average calorie content is 22 kcal/oz and contains a balance of all the necessary nutrients. Breast milk is more readily digested than formula, thus breast fed babies often feed every 1. 5 - 2 hours whereas formula fed babies may feed every 2 - 3 hours. As breast milk is produced by the glandular alveoli, less dense lactose rich milk rapidly reaches the end ductal area first – this constituent of milk is referred to as <b>foremilk.</b> Denser fat molecules more slowly progress down the ducts towards the nipples – the more satiating hindmilk. The beginning of a nursing session starts with letdown of the <b>foremilk</b> followed by hindmilk letdown.

40|$|It is an {{important}} criterion that milk for consumption is produced by healthy cows. The milker (operator) has the possibility (and obligation) of observing the cow and the <b>foremilk</b> before attachment of a conventional milking unit. Milk from cows with abnormal <b>foremilk</b> can be identified and withheld from delivery. Clinical mastitis, blood, and colostrum are the abnormalities being looked for. Blood in the milk is rare outside the colostrum period but may appear due to teat injuries. The immunoglobulin content of colostrum is high and colostrum differs in colour and viscosity from normal milk but normally the stage lasts from 2 - 5 days of lactation only. However, clinical mastitis occurs much more frequently and the prevalence is normally around 0 - 15 % of the cows and is an everyday checkpoint. Clinical mastitis covers {{a whole variety of}} conditions ranging from thin watery milk to milk being strongly abnormal in consistency, colour, smell, and taste. Consequently, the milker may use different senses to detect and sort milk according to quality. In principle, automatic milking systems have the same opportunities to test the milk but sorting of milk requires an exact definition of what is normal and acceptable and what is unacceptable for human consumption. So far, definitions of acceptable milk quality in relation to blood, colostrum, or clinical and subclinical mastitis hav...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the microbiological state and the dynamics of the mammary infections of organic farms in North Spain to discover if the high somatic cell count (SCC) observed in these farms is associated to a high incidence of mastitis. Microbiological cultures and SCC were performed in 8, 496 <b>foremilk</b> samples collected from 160 cows in five representative organic farms from February 2006 to January 2008. Even though 79. 3 % of cultures were positive, only 21. 2 % of the total fit our diagnosis of mastitis (clinical, subclinical and chronic). The great prevalence of Corynebacterium bovis (teat canal-region pathogen) in the positive cultures that did not fit the mastitis diagnosis criteria (nearly 70 %) compared with those that did (27 %) was found to be related to lack of post-milking teat disinfection. The study prevalence of mastitis was 69. 2 % (66. 7 % subclinical mastitis, 27. 8 % clinical mastitis); the mean monthly prevalence was 47. 4 %; the mean monthly incidence was 12. 9 % and the mean duration of infection was 3. 84 ± 3. 98 months The high SCC in <b>foremilk</b> samples from old cows (three or more lactations) not diagnosed as mastitis compared to the heifers, reflects a worsening health status of the animals over time.

Individual quarter <b>foremilk</b> samples were taken using aseptic precautions, and whole udder, {{composite}} samples were obtained using a milk meter, at monthly intervals. The three herds differed with respect to herd size, milking shed design, use of teat spraying, and the incidence of mastitis, both past and present. The bacteriological status of each quarter was determined, {{and the ability of}} the following parameters to distinguish between infected and uninfected quarters, and between infected and uninfected cows was ascertained. (1) Somatic cell count (2) Sodium concentration (3) Potassium concentration (4) Electrical conductivity (5) pH (6) Lactose concentration (7) N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase activity (8) α 1 -antitrypsin concentration With the exception of the antitrypsin concentration, the concentration of each parameter in the milk changed during the course of milk removal. The effect of this variation on the composition of the composite milk sample is discussed. The stage of lactation at which the sample was taken exerted a significant effect on the level of each parameter in quarter <b>foremilk</b> samples. Similar effects were observed with composite samples, although statistical significance was not reached in every instance. Both infected and uninfected udder quarters were affected by the stage of lactation. The age of the cow exerted a significant effect on the levels of a number of the parameters within quarter <b>foremilk</b> samples. The effect of age of the cow on the level of each parameter within composite milk samples was generally not significant. The bacteriological status of the udder quarter exerted a significant effect on the level of each parameter in {{at least one of the}} three herds. The effect of the bacteriological status on the pH and on the potassium concentration of the milk was smaller in degree than was the effect on the remaining parameters. The herds differed with respect to bacteriological findings. Herd A showed a lower incidence of infection than did herds B or C The incidence of infection with minor pathogens was highest within herd B, while the incidence of infection with major pathogens was highest within herd C. The incidence of infection tended to increase with the age of the cow. While each of the eight parameters showed high specificity, the sensitivity was generally lower. An exception to this finding was the somatic cell count which showed both high sensitivity and high specificity. The somatic cell count was able to correctly classify more than 75 % of quarter <b>foremilk</b> samples in each of the three herds, being more consistent in this respect than were any of the other parameters, the diagnostic abilities of which varied between herds. The addition of second parameter to a model containing the somatic cell count generally did not increase the diagnostic accuracy of the system. The threshold value was found to vary both between herds, and between stages of the lactation, this variation being greatest for the somatic cell count.

In this study, we evaluated composition of the bovine udder microbiota in relation to mastitis susceptibility. Udder microbiota was investigated in 31 quarters whose sanitary status ranged from healthy (i. e. no mastitis during the previous lactations) to susceptible to mastitis (i. e. one to several mastitis episodes during each of the previous lactations). Total bacterial DNA was extracted from <b>foremilk</b> sample and swab sample of the teat canal in each quarter. The 16 S DNA was PCR-amplified and pyrosequenced.

Healthy quarters showed a higher diversity compared to mastitis susceptible ones. Discriminant analysis of phylobiomes revealed dysbiosis in mastitis-susceptible quarters and allowed identification of taxonomic markers in relation to mastitis susceptibility. Healthy quarters were associated to {{a higher proportion of}} the Clostridia class, the Bacteroidetes phylum and the Bifidobacteriales order whereas mastitis-susceptible quarters showed a higher proportion of the Bacilli class (Staphylococcus) and Chlamydiia class. These results suggest that a diverse and balanced microbiota in the udder contributes to the mammary gland health, likely by exerting a barrier affect with regard to pathogens, as observed in other contexts (e. g. human gut). Mechanisms of interaction between this endogenous microbiota and the mammary gland deserve further investigations, which will help maintain a balanced mammary microbiota e. g. through the development of mammary probiotics...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Mastitis, {{a complex}} disease, even at {{subclinical}} stage {{has a major}} economic impact on the dairy industry. The disease pattern at machine milking which has recently been introduced in Indian system is to be studied. Therefore {{the present study was}} conducted to see the prevalence, distribution and sensitivity pattern of bacteria at subclinical level in machine milked dairy farms in Punjab state. Materials and Methods: The study involved 10 machine milked dairy cow herds in Ludhiana, Patiala, Moga, Bathinda and Ferozpur districts of Punjab. A total 218 HF × Sahiwal cross-bred dairy cow in milk were studied. About 872 quarter <b>foremilk</b> samples were collected to observe the prevalence of disease, distribution of udder pathogens and antibiotic sensitivity pattern. Results: Prevalence of specific subclinical mastitis was 57. 80...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} {{the results of}} a 2 -step study of the effects induced by near {{infrared}} low intensity laser radiation on bovines affected by subacute mastitis. In the first step, the correlation between Somatic Cells Count (SCC), Lactose and Chloride ion <b>foremilk</b> content in healthy and mastitic quarters of Italian Friesian cows, were studied and compared with the literature data. In the second step, the effects of the Near Infrared Low Intensity Laser Radiation (NIRLILR) on the cow affected by subacute mastitis, were evaluated in terms of 2 average quarter population parameters, the "average Somatic Cell Count" (SCC) and the "average Restoration Factors" (RF). It was revealed that the NIRLILR radiation treatment, in the experimental conditions adopted, caused an effective beneficial response of the cows against the mastitis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDue to the {{tendency}} of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) to accumulate in matrixes with high lipid content, the contamination of the breast milk with these compounds is a serious issue, mainly to the newborn. In this study, milk samples were collected from breastfeeding mothers belonging to 4 Brazilian regions (south, southeast, northeast and north). Twelve PCB were analyzed by HS-SPME-GC-ECD and the corresponding peak areas were correlated to the answers to a questionnaire of general habits, breastfeeding and characteristics of the living places. To realize this exploratory analyze, self-organizing maps generated applying Kohonen neural network were applied. It was possible to verify the occurrence of different PCB congeners in the breast milk relating to {{the region of the}} Brazil that the breastfeeding lives, the proximity to an industry, the proximity to a contaminated river or sea, the type of milk (colostrum, <b>foremilk</b> and hindmilk) and the number of past pregnancies...|$|R

40|$|Thirty cows {{were studied}} {{during the first}} six milkings after calving. Quarter <b>foremilk</b> samples were {{collected}} by the farmers at calving and at six subsequent milkings. Geometric-mean somatic cell count (SCC) decreased from 593, 000 at calving to 126, 000 cells/ml at the sixth milking after calving. In quarters infected with major pathogenic bacteria, geometric-mean SCC was 3, 229, 000 cells/ml at calving, and 1, 257, 000 cells/ml at the sixth milking after calving. In quarters infected with minor pathogenic bacteria, geometric-mean SCC was 1, 000, 000 cells/ml at calving, and 170, 000 cells/ml at the sixth milking after calving. In culture-negative quarters, geometric-mean SCC decreased from 306, 000 at calving to 42, 000 cells/ml at the sixth milking after calving. Quarter SCC can be used early postpartum to give an indication of intra-mammary infection status. LR: 20041117; PUBM: Print; JID: 8217463; ppublishSource type: Electronic(1...|$|R

40|$|Mammary cell {{apoptosis}} and proliferation {{were assessed}} after injection of Escherichia coli {{into the left}} mammary quarters of six cows. Bacteriological analysis of <b>foremilk</b> samples revealed coliform infection in the injected quarters of four cows. Milk somatic cell counts increased in these quarters and peaked at 24 h after bacterial injection. Body temperature also increased, peaking at 12 h postinjection, The number of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in the mastitic tissue than in the uninfected control. Expression of Bax and interleukin- 1 beta converting enzyme increased in the mastitic tissue at 24 h and 72 h postinfection, whereas Bcl- 2 expression decreased at 24 h but {{did not differ significantly}} from the control at 72 h postinfection, Induction of matrix metalloproteinase-g, stromelysin- 1 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator was also observed in the mastitic tissue.

40|$|The {{somatic cell}} count (SCC) in bovine milk is an {{indicator}} of udder health and milk quality. Individual cell populations, i. e., macrophages, lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils, were identified {{and their relationship to}} milk components such as acute-phase proteins (serum amyloid A (SAA) and alpha(1) -acid glycoprotein), lactic acid and lactoferrin (LF), as well as protein, fat and lactose, were studied in <b>foremilk</b> from separate udder quarters. The whey proteins and peptides were studied using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, which was shown in the present study to be a useful method of assessing udder health and milk quality. The growth of a starter culture was evaluated using a conductance method as a simulation of fermentation processes relevant for cheese production. The investigation showed that LF, SAA, L-lactate and lactose are reliable indicators of milk quality on udder quarter level. The correlations between SCC, or the individual cell populations, and the potential indicators were highly significant. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Procedures were {{developed}} to count neutrophils in milk, using a flow cytometer. Milk samples from 2 experiments were counted: 1 with 4 noninfected cows and a second with 5 noninfected cows that were injected with endotoxin in 2 mammary quarters. Thus, the procedures were evaluated on normal milk and on that with high somatic cell count. Flow cytometric procedures involved fluorescence detection (from the dye carboxydimethyifluorescein diacetate) to distinguish intact and viable from fragmented cells, forward light scatter to detect cell size differences, and right-angle side scatter to detect cellular granularity. High fluorescence, large size, and high degree of granularity identified viable neutrophils. For all samples, neutrophils were also counted manually, using the cytologic centrifugation approach to create the slides; manual counts were used as the standard for comparison. In experiment 1 (normal milk), mean values for percentage of viable neutrophils estimated by manual and now cytometry procedures agreed closely (26 % vs 25. 8 % for <b>foremilk</b> and 28. 8 % vs 26. 6 % for bucket milk). Sources of variation in manual and flow cytometric estimates of percentage of neutrophils were examined. Cow variation was significant (P < 0. 01) for manual and flow cytometric counts, but was larger for now cytometric counts. Day-to-day variation in counts on milk from the same cow was negligible for manual counts, but was significant (P < 0. 01) for flow cytometric counts. Coefficients of variation were considerably larger for manual counts than for flow cytometry. In experiment 2 (milk with high cell count, <b>foremilk),</b> agreement between mean values obtained by flow cytometry and by manual counting was somewhat less. However, predicting manual percentage of neutrophils, using the flow cytometric estimate, had R(2) of 0. 77. Regression of the manual percentage of neutrophils value on the now cytometric percentage of neutrophil value was close to 1. 0, with only a small negative intercept. Some additional refinement of flow cytometric procedures may be required before now cytometric estimates of percentage of neutrophils can be accepted without simultaneous validation by use of manual counting. In particular, causes of day-today variation in flow cytometric results should be identified and reduced...|$|R
