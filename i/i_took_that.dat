Two pilots were taped on February 13, 2002: one with original Press Your Luck host Peter Tomarken and the other hosted by Todd Newton. Newton was ultimately chosen to host the show. Tomarken explained that he was asked to change his style of hosting, saying, [...] "It was terribly hurtful and I think I was doomed before I did [...] I remember being told, 'No, no. Be nice.

500|$|Gibson {{traveled}} to Tokyo in 2001 {{to prepare for}} this new novel, which takes place in London, Moscow, and Tokyo. He did not travel to London or Moscow but used interviews with friends and internet resources for research. In September 2001 Gibson had written about 100pages but was struggling to finish. He stopped writing after watching the September 11, 2001 attacks on television and [...] "realized [...] had become a story {{that took place in}} an alternate time track, in which Sept. 11 hadn't happened". He considered abandoning the novel but a few weeks later re-wrote portions to use the attacks as a motivating factor for the distress the main character feels. In a 2003 interview he said, [...] "There I was, in the winter of 2001, with no idea what the summer of 2002 was going to be like. ... In the original post-9/11 draft, London felt more like London is feeling right now. Cayce keeps seeing trucks full of soldiers. But <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>that</b> out, because as it got closer to the time, it wasn't actually happening." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{designing}} the credit sequence for the film, graphic designer Daniel Kleinman {{was inspired by}} the cover of the 1953 British first edition of Casino Royale, which featured Ian Fleming's original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with blood. Kleinman said, [...] "The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond's love story. So <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>that</b> as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles," [...] like a club representing a puff of gun smoke, and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts. In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitised the footage of Craig and the film's stuntmen on the Inferno visual effects system, at Framestore CFC in London; the actors' silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns. Kleinman decided not to use the female silhouettes commonly seen throughout the Bond title sequences, considering that the women did not fit with both the film's spirit and the storyline following Bond falling in love.|$|E

Professional wrestlers Andrew [...] "Test" [...] Martin and Oleg [...] "Vladimir Kozlov" [...] Prudius also featured, plus Olja Hrustic, Meriah Nelson, and Lorielle New as the Werewolf Women. According to Zombie, [...] "Basically, I had two ideas. It was {{either going to}} be a Nazi movie or a women-in-prison film, and I went with the Nazis. There're all those movies like Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS; Fräulein Devil; and Love Camp 7—I've always found that to be the most bizarre genre." [...] Zombie is also quoted as saying [...] "I was getting very {{conceptual}} in my own mind with it. [...] A lot of times these movies would be made like, 'Well, you know, I've got a whole bunch of Nazi uniforms, but I got this Chinese set too. We'll put 'em together!'

500|$|Between 1991 and 1997, Colón {{attended}} the Jesuit Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, {{from which he}} graduated. Unsatisfied with his physical conditioning, he began attending a gym as an 11-year-old. Despite this, Colón has stated {{that he did not}} intend to become a wrestler at first and only did so for exercise. It was not until completing his college education that he decided to train, after noticing that his condition was on par with the wrestlers despite his age. However, despite this Colón initially expected to retire within ten years and run a private business. He admits that during this initial stage, he received peer pressure to match the accomplishments of his father. Colón's decision to sign with World Wrestling Entertainment was a controversial one among the Puerto Rican wrestling community. He was criticized by the locals, labeled as someone who had [...] "sold out" [...] his Puerto Rican wrestling traditions over for the [...] "flash and flair" [...] of the American company. Colón spoke of this in an interview with The Sun in which he stated [...] "I did not care about what they thought. I've always dreamed of working for the WWE when I was young, and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>that</b> chance when it came".|$|E
500|$|According to MTV News, {{the song}} [...] "touches on Drake {{reaction}} to fame and stardom". Drake told MTV News, that {{the song was}} [...] "definitely" [...] a choice of his for releasing as a single, {{and that it was}} a song he did for himself. [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song, [...] "a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness." [...] The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's [...] "Hip-Hop", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. Ironically, Dead Prez's track is meant as a jab at media controlled artists like Drake, stating, [...] "One thing about music when it hits you feel no pain/ White folks say it controls your brain/ I know better than that/ It's just game", to which Drake stated when asked about it, [...] "I love that flow. So <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>that</b> flow and flipped it in the second verse." [...] He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his [...] "Thriller" [...] video, though the lines, [...] "'Bout to go 'Thriller' Mike Jackson on these niggas/ All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers." [...] On the reference, Drake said, [...] "That was sort of my reference point; that phenomenon of Michael. He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great." ...|$|E

[...] He further assured that he and his brother Ethan had never met McCarthy when they were writing the script, but first met him during the shooting of the film. He believed that the author liked the film, while his brother Ethan said, [...] "he didn't yell at us.

2500|$|Stephanie Maslansky is {{the costume}} {{designer}} for Iron Fist, after serving {{the same role}} for the previous Marvel Netflix series. Maslansky noted one {{of the differences in}} the series compared to the other Marvel Netflix series was the neighborhoods it spent time in ("the wealthier neighborhoods; Midtown, Upper East Side, that sort of thing") compared to Hell's Kitchen for Daredevil and Jessica Jones and Harlem for Luke Cage. As such, Rand wears more suits than the other heroes, and given the amount of fighting he does in the season, a lot of spandex was added to increase the suits' flexibility. Rand's look evolves throughout the season, with Maslansky noting, [...] "When we first meet him he's clearly traveled a long way. I wanted people to look at Danny and not be sure exactly what he was. A backpacker, or a homeless man. His look needed to reflect a variety of culture... almost ... otherworldly." [...] Once Rand enters the corporate world, he settles on an [...] "Urban Cali" [...] style, which is [...] "a little looser, little more relaxed. But it’s still a suit. His tie is never tied tightly and he always wears sneakers." [...] This relaxed style for Rand also provided [...] "a strong contrast" [...] to Ward Meachum who is a [...] "far more corporate looking person." [...] The monk costumes and Rand's warrior costume was based on [...] "real Shaolin warrior monk costumes... <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>that</b> distinctive silhouette from the Shaolin warrior monk clothing, and we combined it with the traditional colors of the Iron Fist, green and gold." [...] Regarding Gao, Maslansky stated [...] "Her particular look is influenced by ancient China," [...] particularly the Terracotta Army and further progress the [...] "villainy" [...] look of the Marvel Netflix series of [...] "surround themselves with , with beautiful things." ...|$|E
