25|$|After {{recovering}} from his wounds, in February 1916 King was appointed {{commander of the}} New Zealand Pioneer Battalion. The battalion {{was part of the}} New Zealand Division then being formed by Russell (now a major general) in Egypt following the withdrawal of Allied forces from Gallipoli. The battalion was a mix of personnel and included the survivors of the Otago Mounted Rifles, men of the Māori contingents as well as Pacific Islanders. King, well regarded by Russell, set about merging the various elements of the battalion, many of whom were not particularly happy at losing the identity of their parent formations, into an <b>effective</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
25|$|A special Korean {{detachment}} {{was formed}} in 1937 out of ethnic Koreans by a local businessman who was of Korean descent. The Japanese liked the idea as they believed Koreans had no loyalty to the Chinese and would be more dependable. All posts were filled in December 1938 and the first class of recruits arrived at a training center in 1939. It was initially small and consisted a headquarters, and infantry company and mortar battery, later being expanded {{with the addition of}} a second infantry company in 1940. The unit saw heavy action against Communist guerrillas and bandits, being regarded by the Japanese as a ruthless and <b>effective</b> <b>unit.</b> The detachment came to be known for its brutality and was one of the few puppet units that earned the respect of its Japanese superiors due to its martial spirit.|$|E

25|$|The entire III Cavalry Corps fought at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June. Shortly before 4:00 PM, Ney {{ordered a}} brigade of the IV Cavalry Corps {{to launch a}} charge. By some mistake the entire corps plus the Imperial Guard light cavalry joined the assault. The massed attacks failed {{in the face of}} Anglo-Allied {{infantry}} squares, artillery fire, and cavalry counterattacks. Napoleon ordered Kellermann to help disengage his mauled cavalry formations. As happened with the earlier order, events spiralled out of control when Lhéritier and Roussel sent their heavy cavalrymen into the charge without waiting for orders from their corps commander. Though the new attacks were bravely repeated, they failed to break the Anglo-Allied lines. By 6:00 PM the splendid regiments of French heavy cavalry were no longer battle-worthy. Nevertheless, they could still inflict losses on badly-deployed Allied formations. At some time in the afternoon, a body of cuirassiers rode down the 8th King's German Legion Infantry Battalion while it was advancing in line formation near La Haye Sainte. The battalion was destroyed as an <b>effective</b> <b>unit</b> and a companion battalion, the 5th, only escaped by rapidly forming square and retreating.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to those, several special units that functioned {{outside of the}} main command structure of the military also existed. The Manchukuo Imperial Guard was formed out of soldiers of ethnic Manchu descent, charged with {{the protection of the}} Kangde Emperor (Puyi) and senior officials, as well as to function as an honor guard. Despite this it took part in combat and was considered to be an <b>effective</b> <b>unit.</b> Throughout the 1930s a [...] "Mongolian Independence Army" [...] was established out of about 6,000 ethnic Mongolian recruits and fought its own war against bandits with some success. It was expanded in 1938 but merged with the regular Imperial Army in 1940, although Mongol units continued to perform well. A special Korean detachment was formed in 1937 on the personal initiative of a businessman of Korean descent. The unit was small but distinguished itself in combat against Communist guerrillas and was noted by the Japanese for its martial spirit, becoming one of the few puppet units to earn the respect of its Japanese superiors.|$|E
60|$|I find it convenient, {{and perhaps}} the reader will allow me, to break into a more {{personal}} account of what followed. It drove us all mad to watch idly in camp the horrible shelling that was directed on the captured position, and at about four o'clock I rode with Captain R. Brooke, 7th Hussars, to Spion Kop, {{to find out what}} the true situation was. We passed through the ambulance village, and leaving our horses climbed up the spur. Streams of wounded met us and obstructed the path. Men were staggering along alone, or supported by comrades, or crawling on hands and knees, or carried on stretchers. Corpses lay here and there. Many of the wounds were of a horrible nature. The splinters and fragments of the shell had torn and mutilated in the most ghastly manner. I passed about two hundred while I was climbing up. There was, moreover, a small but steady leakage of unwounded men of all corps. Some of these cursed and swore. Others were utterly exhausted and fell on the hillside in stupor. Others again seemed drunk, though they had had no liquor. Scores were sleeping heavily. Fighting was still proceeding, and stray bullets struck all over the ground, while the Maxim shell guns scourged the flanks of the hill and the sheltering infantry at regular intervals of a minute. The 3rd King's Royal Rifles were out of reach. The Dorset Regiment was the only battalion not thrown into the fight, and intact as an <b>effective</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
