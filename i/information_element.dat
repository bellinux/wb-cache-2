50|$|The Traffic {{indication}} map <b>information</b> <b>element</b> {{is covered}} under section 7.3.2.6 of 802.11-1999 standard. The IEEE 802.11 standards {{chose to use}} a bitmap to indicate to any sleeping listening stations if the Access Point (AP) has any buffered frames present for it. Because stations should listen {{to at least one}} beacon before the listen interval, the AP periodically sends this bitmap on its beacons as an <b>information</b> <b>element.</b> The bit mask is called the Traffic Indication Map and consists of 2008 bits, each bit representing the Association Id (AID) of a station. For example, the TIM <b>information</b> <b>element</b> allows you to transfer 1 byte up to the entire 251 bytes (2008 bits) of the TIM, you are allowed to transmit a smaller TIM bitmap as it is expected that only a few number of stations will be asleep. Because of this the bitmap values passed in the TIM <b>information</b> <b>element</b> is called a partial virtual bitmap. To allow you to transmit only a partial bitmap you must make use of the bitmap control and length fields of the TIM <b>information</b> <b>element.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review a {{particular}} connection between information theory and group theory. We formalize {{the notions of}} <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> and <b>information</b> lattices, first proposed by Shannon. Exploiting this formalization, we expose a comprehensive parallelism between information lattices and subgroup lattices. Qualitatively, isomorphisms between information lattices and subgroup lattices are demonstrated. Quantitatively, a decisive approximation relation between the entropy structures of information lattices and the log-index structures of the corresponding subgroup lattices, first discovered by Chan and Yeung, is highlighted. This approximation, addressing both joint and common entropies, extends the work of Chan and Yeung on joint entropy. A consequence of this approximation result is that any continuous law holds in general for the entropies of <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> {{if and only if}} the same law holds in general for the log-indices of subgroups. As an application, by constructing subgroup counterexamples, we find surprisingly that common information, unlike joint information, obeys neither the submodularity nor the supermodularity law. We emphasize that the notion of <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> is conceptually significant—formalizing it helps to reveal the deep connection between information theory and group theory. The parallelism established in this paper admits an appealing group-action explanation and provides useful insights into the intrinsic structure among <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> from a group-theoretic perspective...|$|R

Presentation at the 9 th International Conference on Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), Hong Kong, China. Collaboration in virtual project teams heavily relies on interpersonal trust, for which perceived trustworthiness is an important determinant. This study provides insight in the foundation of trustors’ information preferences to assess a trustee’s professional trustworthiness in the initial phase of a virtual project team. We hypothesize that trustors in virtual teams prefer particular <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> since they provide them with relevant cues for trust warranting properties of a trustee. Starting from a list of commonly preferred <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> to inform trustworthiness assessments (n= 226), we analyze explanations for these preferences with the help of a theory-grounded coding scheme. Results show that indeed respondents prefer <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> as they provide them with multiple cues to assess the trustworthiness of a trustee. <b>Information</b> <b>elements</b> providing unique cues could not be identified.
