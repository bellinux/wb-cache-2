The thesis {{is focused on the}} demographics of seniors and social services intended for them, specifically retirement homes. In addition to analyzing the accessibility of social services is elaborated <b>demographic</b> <b>projection</b> of region's population over the next 50 years. In the theoretical part is described the definition of social policy and the fundamental theoretical principles, types and functions. This part also describes the legislative framework of social policy in the Czech Republic. In relation to social policy are presented issues of community planning as a tool for the implementation of social policy in the Karlovarsky region. The conclusion of theoretical part is devoted to the theory of demographic projections and describes the basic projection methods. The practical part in the introduction focuses on general and demographic characteristics of the Karlovarsky region and the current state of social services for the elderly, specifically homes for the elderly. The second half of the practical part presents a <b>demographic</b> <b>projection</b> of region's population over the next 50 years and is focusing on senior component whose proportion in the population will increase. This projection is calculated by the component method without migration. The conclusion of the practical part is comparing the initial state of social services and the anticipated development of seniors. It also describes community plan in the Karlovarsky region with emphasis on the development of social services for seniors. Documents drawn up by the Karlovarsky region on issues of social services and conclusions of this thesis suggest that {{there is no need to}} increase capacity, but rather to focus on the change in the structure of users and ensure that these services are provided to people whose health condition really requires this kind of complex social care...|$|E
