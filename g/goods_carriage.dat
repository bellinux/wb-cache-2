A monorail <b>goods</b> <b>carriage</b> system was initially installed along this cart route. In 1908 the monorail was replaced by a 24 inch gauge railway.

5000|$|Kundala Valley Railway {{was built}} in 1902 and {{operated}} between Munnar and Top Station in the Kannan Devan Hills of Kerala [...] This railway was built to transport tea and other goods. Initially a cart road was cut in 1902, then later replaced by a monorail <b>goods</b> <b>carriage</b> system along the road leading from Munnar to Top Station {{for the purpose of}} transporting tea and other products from Munnar and Madupatty to Top Station. This monorail was based on the Ewing System and had a small wheel placed on the track while a larger wheel rested on the road to balance the monorail. This was similar to the Patiala State Monorail Trainways. The monorail was pulled by bullocks. Top Station was a transshipment point for delivery of tea from Munnar to Bodinayakkanur. Tea chests arriving at Top Station were then transported by an aerial ropeway from Top Station 5 km down hill to the south to Kottagudi, Tamil Nadu, which popularly became known as [...] "Bottom Station". The tea was shipped 15 km by cart to Bodinayakkanur, then by rail to other places in India and by ship to England.|$|E

30|$|In {{light of}} this, {{increasing}} attention {{must be given}} to the process of facilitating collaboration. The interview with P&G, for instance, specifically noted that they would look to collaborate/bundle goods with a “non-competing” partner. This sort of stipulation of course adds a degree of complexity to the process. In this sense the addition of a neutral 3 rd party (logistics service provider or freight forwarder) is essential, especially when consolidating goods from a semi competing market. A freight forwarder (FF), not usually a carrier, but an intermediary between cargo interest and carrier, such as rail and road, has a major role - for example by arranging <b>goods</b> <b>carriage</b> between origin and destination. The FF may not conduct the carriage of goods but will accept the liability for the entire agreed carriage [36].|$|E

40|$|Transport {{of goods}} in {{containers}} and cargo transport units by sea {{as part of}} multimodal transport chains presents unique challenges from a safety perspective. The units can hold a broad mix of cargo types, including dangerous goods with hazardous properties. The purpose of this thesis {{was to assess the}} risk of carrying dangerous goods as packaged cargo by sea, with a main focus on transport safety. A better understanding of this risk can lead to fewer human, environmental, and economic losses. Studies on the safety risks associated with sea transport of containerised goods were carried out, starting with an investigation into the overall risk of fires on container ships, continuing with analyses of the risk of dangerous <b>goods</b> <b>carriage,</b> and concluding with an investigation into the factors contributing to the release of dangerous goods on board. The sea transport link of the transport chain was of prime interest from a safety perspective, but earlier parts of the chain were also considered for the investigation of contributing factors. Analysis of accident, incident, and inspection reports and databases was {{a key part of the}} approach taken to carry out the work. Risk analysis techniques, primarily event tree and fault tree techniques, were used both quantitatively and qualitatively to estimate risk and develop explanatory models. The container ship risk analysis modelling work determined that the fire/explosion accident category was the second largest contributor to overall human safety risk, and the analysis of historical data found it to be responsible for the most crew fatalities reported for the period 1993 – 2004. The cargo area was found to be the location of fire initiation for 32 % of serious fire/explosion events on container ships for a later period investigated (1998 to 2008) and undeclared dangerous goods were found to be involved in 25 % of these cargo area fires. Dangerous goods involvement was identified for 15 % of crew fatalities resulting from container ship casualties during this 11 -year period. The investigation of release of packaged dangerous goods during maritime transport found most contributing factors originated prior to the goods being loaded on to the ship. The findings are useful from a safety perspective as they identify where in the transport chain faults are occurring and also the importance of dangerous goods incidents and fires in relation to other accident types...|$|E
40|$|AbstractReforming {{processes}} of a railway transport {{based on those}} positive tendencies, which were recently observed in the transport market. They are caused by competitive rising of all railways in CIS countries and Baltic States. Experience of the countries with developed economy shows us, that reforming processes should be lead with receiving possibility system-wide effect from the individual interconnected subsystems functioning (units of rail transport) like unified system. Systematic approach to the justification the process of reform {{and development of the}} railway sector provides the formation of a dynamic model of the individual transport units, consisting of a single organizational – technological structure. This enables the system to be generally aimed at achieving the objectives of its functioning. So, such structure can be considered a major transport system for which is characterized by new properties and characteristics and all separate rail divisions acquire the status of system elements. In order to improve the quality characteristics of the transport process and the efficiency of cargo service, solving management task and logistic system rationalization of the goods delivery can be carried out the basis of multi-criteria methods, taking into account conservation approach. General industry logistic system should consist of the railways, their units, some large railway stations in conjunction with the relevant subsystems cargo. In process of the logistic system centers formation appears a question of managing their organizational structure. In our opinion one of the main factors which {{must be taken into account}} in shaping the organizational structure of logistics centers is an opportunity to achieve a high service level with taking in account availability of internal and external constraints. Modern conditions needs to formalize the functioning of large dynamic rail system from the system approach position, which is directed on system-wide optimization (synergistic) effect and takes into account the complex of all participants interests in the transportation process. One of the main limits for this system is a providing of the resources cost reduction (rolling stock, amount of cargo on the route to the consumer, staff etc.) for an assimilation given traffic volumes. From the logistics view point customers needs main services connected with transportation, storage, loading and unloading, warehousing, order processing, inventory management, herewith, services are seen as interrelated and interactive. On the other hand, in this complex are especially important logistics service indicators (service quality, compliance is “just in time”, etc.). Herewith logistic system should take on additional functions, which are accompany transportation, such as packaging, labeling, sorting goods, transportation design, determining the optimal transportation options, control over the movement of goods in transit. To do this, you first need to ensure the absolute safety of cargo; offer the full range of transport services; simplification of <b>goods</b> <b>carriage</b> and tariff system; reducing the delivery time; creation of a powerful and modern information network; clear interaction organization with a motor companies or obtaining of own one for delivery ensuring...|$|E
