[...] His portrait was painted many times; after sitting for Sir William Orpen in 1924, Lang reportedly remarked to Bishop Hensley Henson of Durham that the portrait showed him as [...] "proud, prelatical and pompous".

500|$|The best-known anecdote of Henson, {{according}} to Chadwick, {{comes from his}} time at Durham. Cosmo Lang complained that his portrait by Orpen [...] "makes me look proud, pompous and prelatical", to which Henson responded, [...] "And to which of those epithets <b>does</b> <b>your</b> Grace take exception?" [...] Grimley remarks that on occasion each of those unflattering adjectives applied just as much to Henson. Nonetheless, Henson ranked Lang [...] "among the greater figures of ecclesiastical history".|$|E
500|$|... "Midnight in a Perfect World" [...] layers a soulful vocal {{line and}} a slow drum beat. It is based around mournful piano sampled from David Axelrod's 1969 song [...] "The Human Abstract". [...] "Napalm Brain/Scatter Brain" [...] builds slowly, {{starting}} with a bass{{line and a}} looped drum break before its tempo speeds and additional instrumentation enters; the track eventually reaches its climax and deconstructs itself, leaving a single string sample playing by its conclusion. Endtroducing..... concludes on a somber note with [...] "What <b>Does</b> <b>Your</b> Soul Look Like (Part 1 – Blue Sky Revisit)", a wistful track that blends a warm saxophone hook with a keyboard refrain. The track eventually transitions into a third and final [...] "transmission", which closes the album with the words [...] "It is happening again." [...] being spoken by an [...] "enigmatic" [...] voice, that of The Giant from the television series Twin Peaks.|$|E

500|$|DJ Shadow's singles for Mo' Wax – {{including}} [...] "In/Flux" [...] and [...] "Lost and Found (S.F.L.)" [...] – were, as Sean Cooper of AllMusic wrote, {{hailed as}} [...] "genre-bending {{works of art}} that merged elements of funk, rock, hip hop, ambient, jazz, soul, and used-bin found records." [...] Andy Pemberton, a music journalist writing for Mixmag, coined the term [...] "trip hop" [...] in June 1994 to describe [...] "In/Flux" [...] and similar tracks being spun in London clubs at the time. DJ Shadow's follow-up single [...] "What <b>Does</b> <b>Your</b> Soul Look Like" [...] topped the British independent music charts. Following this period, he began work on his debut album, intent on capturing the downbeat mood that characterized his aforementioned three singles. The album was aptly titled Endtroducing....., as according to DJ Shadow, [...] "it signified the fourth and final chapter {{in a series of}} pieces that I was doing for Mo' Wax with a certain sound, a certain tone, a certain atmosphere." ...|$|E
500|$|Endtroducing..... {{is opened}} by [...] "Best Foot Forward", a brief 48-second collage of record {{scratching}} and various hip hop vocal samples. [...] "Building Steam with a Grain of Salt" [...] {{is built around}} a looped piano melody, with various other musical elements entering throughout the song's duration: interview samples, a women's choir, bass fills, electronically altered drum kicks, and a funk guitar. [...] "The Number Song" [...] is characterized by its usage of various breakbeats and vocal samples of count-offs. [...] "Changeling" [...] is reminiscent of new-age music and differs from the fast-paced nature of the album's previous tracks, slowly building up as more samples are mixed in before finally ending with a [...] "sublimely spacey" [...] coda. It segues into {{the first of three}} [...] "transmissions" [...] placed throughout the album, each featuring a recurring sample from the film Prince of Darkness (1987). [...] "What <b>Does</b> <b>Your</b> Soul Look Like (Part 4)" [...] evokes [...] "uneasy futurism and techno-anxiety" [...] and fuses a [...] "rolling bass groan" [...] with wordless, robotic chants. Track six is an untitled interlude featuring a man reciting a monologue about [...] "Maureen and her five sisters" [...] over a funk sample.|$|E
500|$|Endtroducing..... was {{released}} on September 16, 1996, in the United Kingdom and on November 19, 1996, in the United States on Mo' Wax. DJ Shadow promoted the album through various interviews and press appearances. The album performed well in the United Kingdom, spending three weeks on the UK Albums Chart and peaking at number 17. It also managed to chart in the Netherlands, where it peaked at number 75. [...] "Midnight in a Perfect World" [...] had previously been released as the album's first single in September, and it {{was released}} to American college and modern rock stations in January 1997. The single's music video, directed by B Plus, received prominent airtime on the MTV program Amp; the single itself peaked at number 54 on the UK Singles Chart. [...] "Stem" [...] was released as the album's second single on October 28, 1996, peaking at number 74 in the United Kingdom and at number 14 in Ireland – DJ Shadow's first top twenty hit on a singles chart. A remix single of [...] "What <b>Does</b> <b>Your</b> Soul Look Like (Part 1 – Blue Sky Revisit)" [...] followed in 1997, reaching a peak position of 54 in the UK. A fourth and final single – a double A-side release featuring American music producer Cut Chemist's remix of [...] "The Number Song" [...] and DJ Shadow's own remix of English electronic music band Depeche Mode's [...] "Painkiller" [...] – was issued on February 23, 1998.|$|E

2500|$|During the Battle of Shiloh, General Hardee nicknamed {{this unit}} [...] "The Bloody Seventh." [...] The 7th Arkansas had been formed with 905 {{officers}} and men, {{but after the}} conflict at Shiloh there were only 380 present. Colonel Shaver was assigned to command a brigade, which consisted of the 2nd, 6th and 7th Arkansas Infantry Regiments. [...] Shaver's Brigade struck the first blow in the battle before sunrise on April 6, 1862. [...] The Arkansas troops initially rushed into a Union camp of two German regiments from St. Louis, MO, and regiments from Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois—all commanded by Colonel Peabody. [...] When the pickets' fire was heard in the Union encampment, Colonel Peabody's men took up defensive positions {{on the edge of}} their camp and laid down heavy fire. [...] Shaver's Brigade rushed them with a wild Rebel yell. [...] The Uionn troops stood their ground until the Arkansas soldiers were within 30 feet of them and then they broke and fled. [...] The Shaver's men pushed in amongst the retreating Union soldiers and a fierce hand-to-hand melee followed. [...] More than Union troops were bayoneted, including Colonel Peabody. [...] Shaver's Brigade had rushed forward so fast that General Hardee halted them at that point until the line of battle could catch up. [...] The 7th Arkansas, together with most of the Arkansas troops at the Battle of Shiloh, was armed mainly with flintlock muskets, flintlock & percussion shotguns and various other outdated smooth bore weapons supplied from the soldiers' own homes. [...] In Colonel Peabody's camp they found 2000 new M1853 Enfield rifled muskets (still in their wooden crates) complete with ammunition. [...] So the men of the 7th threw away their outdated weapons, took up the new Enfield muskets, and continued fighting. [...] Later, still on the first day, Shaver's Brigade made an attack against the 24th Missouri Infantry Regiment (Unionn). [...] During the battle of Pittsburgh Landing every officer on Shaver's staff was either killed or wounded. [...] Colonel Shaver had four horses killed under him before he was critically wounded by an artillery shell {{on the second day of}} fighting. [...] Lieutenant Colonel John M. Dean, who had field command of the 7th in place of Colonel Shaver, was killed during a charge at Shiloh. Lieutenant Colonel Dean led his men into battle at Shiloh with his musicians (drum and fife) playing the song [...] "Granny <b>does</b> <b>your</b> Dog Bite?" [...] Lt. Colonel Dean was mentioned in the afteraction reports for the gallantry that he and his men displayed at Shioh.|$|E
