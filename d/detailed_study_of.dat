5|$|The Dutch East Indies {{government}} then commissioned F.C. Wilsen, a Dutch engineering official, {{who studied}} the monument and drew hundreds of relief sketches. J.F.G. Brumund was also appointed to make a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the monument, which was completed in 1859. The government intended to publish an article based on Brumund's study supplemented by Wilsen's drawings, but Brumund refused to cooperate. The government then commissioned another scholar, C. Leemans, who compiled a monograph based on Brumund's and Wilsen's sources. In 1873, the first monograph of the <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> Borobudur was published, followed by its French translation a year later. The first photograph of the monument was taken in 1872 by a Dutch-Flemish engraver, Isidore van Kinsbergen.|$|E
5|$|A Tarbosaurus skull {{found in}} 1948 by Soviet and Mongolian {{scientists}} (PIN 553-1, originally called Gorgosaurus lancinator) included the skull cavity {{that held the}} brain.

5|$|After {{receiving}} Staines's report, the Admiralty {{decided to}} take no action. In the following years, many ships called at Pitcairn Island and heard Adams's various stories of {{the foundation of the}} Pitcairn settlement. Adams died in 1829, honoured as the founder and father of a community that became celebrated over the next century as an exemplar of Victorian morality. Over the years, many recovered Bounty artefacts have been sold by islanders as souvenirs; in 1999, the Pitcairn Project was established by a consortium of Australian academic and historical bodies, to survey and document all the material remaining on-site, as part of a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the settlement's development.|$|E
5|$|After the side-scan sonar aboard Geosounder was {{switched}} {{out for the}} ROV (again {{delayed by}} technical issues and more bad weather), the survey ship returned to Sydneys wreck site on 3 April, and performed a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the ship and her debris field. Inspections were also carried out on Kormoran and the believed battle site (the latter found to be outcrops of pillow lava), before Mearns declared the search over on 7 April. In April 2015, an expedition to the wrecks by Curtin University and the Western Australian Museum commenced, {{with the objective of}} using 3D imaging to map the wrecksites for further study, and to determine if any deterioration since the 2008 discovery requires the development of a conservation management plan.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} other {{alternatives}} were discarded, consensus gradually grew for the Flåm alternative, and the Railway Committee for Nordre Bergenhus County recommended this proposal. New plans from NSB criticized {{the mix of}} rack and adhesion railway, and instead proposed a conventional adhesion line all the way. Engineer Ferdinand Bjerke traveled to Continental Europe to study several combined railways. He published a preliminary report in 1911, which recommended an adhesion railway, although he also felt {{the need for a}} <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> a rack railway. His final report was finished in 1913, and although it recommended adhesion, it pointed out that the line's capacity would be smaller than predicted and that costs would be three times as high—NOK5.5 million. The plans were approved by the Ministry of Labour and NSB's main board in 1915.|$|E

The Commission attended technical presentations, participated in question-and-answer sessions about the Candidature File, and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city. Though considered a favorite entering the voting process, and despite personal appeals from such high-profile Chicagoans as U.S. President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Oprah Winfrey, Chicago was eliminated on the first ballot in IOC voting on October 2, 2009, with 18 votes in a three-round exhaustive ballot of the IOC.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{set out a}} <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> common descent with {{modifications}} {{by expanding}} {{on the theme of}} coevolution between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in On the Origin of Species. He examined numerous ways in which orchids vary, showing how they had diverged and developed specialised pollen-dispersal mechanisms. The intricate morphology and anatomy of each flower was carefully described. Apparently trivial details were examined in relation to natural selection to demonstrate how slight variations in similar structures of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators (insects) with different ways to cross-fertilise. The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, but the result is demanding to read.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, further {{research}} on the fossils was continued by two American scientists sponsored by the American Institute of Indian Studies, New Delhi and the National Geographic Society, U.S.A. The Americans, Paul Sereno and Jeff Wilson, started {{the reconstruction of the}} collection of dinosaur bones gathered in 1983 and 1984. The team of scientists, after a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the maps prepared earlier by Srivastava, were able to reconstruct the partial skull, left and right hip bones, and a sacrum. They interpreted the part of a skull and a horn as resembling those of dinosaurs found in Madagascar. Fossils of Rajasaurus were also found near Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. In all, the collected fossils include a partial skull, limb bones, hip bones, and vertebrae.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo's {{youth was}} spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, {{displayed}} the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> perspective, {{and was the first}} painter to make a scientific study of light.

5|$|Several {{volcanic}} {{features in}} the Mount Cayley field were illustrated by volcanologist Jack Souther in 1980, including Mount Cayley, Cauldron Dome, Slag Hill, Mount Fee, Ember Ridge and Ring Mountain, which was titled Crucible Dome at the time. This resulted {{in the creation of}} a geologic map that showed the regional terrain and locations of the volcanoes. The most <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> Mount Cayley took place during this period. Little Ring Mountain at the northernmost end of the field had not been studied at the time and was not included on Souther's 1980 map. Ember Ridge at the southern end of the field was originally mapped as a cluster of five lava domes. The sixth lava dome, Ember Ridge Northeast, was discovered by Ph.D. student Melanie Kelman during a period of research in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises are omnivores, eating insects, other arthropods, small {{birds and}} reptiles, eggs, fruits, gums, nectar and {{miscellaneous}} vegetation. A 1984 {{study of the}} Sunda slow loris indicated that its diet consists of 71% fruit and gums, and 29% insects and other animal prey. A more <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> another Sunda slow loris population in 2002 and 2003 showed different dietary proportions, consisting of 43.3% gum, 31.7% nectar, 22.5% fruit, and just 2.5% arthropods and other animal prey. The most common dietary item was nectar from flowers of the Bertram palm (Eugeissona tristis). The Sunda slow loris eats insects that other predators avoid due to their repugnant taste or smell.|$|E
5|$|The bipedal-quadrupedal {{consensus}} was changed by a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the forelimbs of Plateosaurus by Bonnan and Senter (2007), which clearly showed that Plateosaurus {{was incapable of}} pronating its hands. The pronated position in some museum mounts had been achieved by exchanging the position of radius and ulna in the elbow. The lack of forelimb pronation meant that Plateosaurus was an obligate (i.e. unable to walk in any other way) biped. Further indicators for a purely bipedal mode of locomotion are the great difference in limb length (the hind limb is roughly {{twice as long as}} the forelimb), the very limited motion range of the forelimb, {{and the fact that the}} centre of mass rests squarely over the hind limbs.|$|E

5|$|The first {{successful}} efforts at conserving the species were {{initiated by the}} establishment of Brisbane's Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary and Sydney's Koala Park Sanctuary in the 1920s and 1930s. The owner of the latter park, Noel Burnet, became the first to successfully breed koalas and {{earned a reputation as}} the foremost contemporary authority on the marsupial. In 1934, David Fleay, curator of Australian mammals at the Melbourne Zoo, established the first Australian faunal enclosure at an Australian zoo, and featured the koala. This arrangement allowed him to undertake a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> its diet in captivity. Fleay later continued his conservation efforts at Healesville Sanctuary and the David Fleay Wildlife Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} AMNHFARB6810, the best-preserved skull of Plateosaurus {{that has been}} taken apart during {{preparation}} and is thus available as separate bones, was described anew in 2011. The authors of that publication, palaeontologists Albert Prieto-Márquez and Mark A. Norell, refer the skull to P.erlenbergensis, a species erected in 1905 by Friedrich von Huene. If the P.erlenbergensis holotype is diagnostic (i.e., has enough characters to be distinct from other material), it is the correct name for the material assigned to P.longiceps Jaekel, 1913. However, according to the last <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the holotype material of P.engelhardti by Markus Moser, P.erlenbergensis is a junior synonym of P.engelhardti.|$|E
5|$|Hata's major {{contribution}} to Nanking Massacre studies is his book Nankin jiken ("The Nanking Incident"), published in 1986, {{which is a}} <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the event based on Japanese, Chinese, and English sources that was later noted by historians such as Daqing Yang {{to be one of}} the few impartial works of scholarship written on the massacre during the period. The book is known for its relatively low estimate of the death toll, which Hata put at up to 40,000 because he based the number of civilian killing on the work of Lewis S.C. Smythe who conducted survey of massacre in the immediate aftermass (War Damage in Nanking Area, Dec.1937 to March 1938, Urban and Rural Surveys) and also exclude Chinese soldiers. Hata's book is acknowledged as the first to discuss what might have caused the massacre, whereas previous books had focused only on the event itself. Hata argued that the Japanese Army's lack of military police and facilities to detain POWs, its ignorance of international laws, and the Chinese General Tang Shengzhi's decision to flee the city without formally surrendering, which left large number of plain-clothes soldiers within the civilian population which was followed by excessive mopping-up operations by the Japanese, among the factors which led to the slaughter.|$|E
