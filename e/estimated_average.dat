5|$|Rhenium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Re and atomic number 75. It is a silvery-white, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table. With an <b>estimated</b> <b>average</b> concentration of 1 part per billion (ppb), rhenium {{is one of}} the rarest elements in the Earth's crust. Rhenium has the third-highest melting point and second-highest boiling point of any element at 5903K. Rhenium resembles manganese and technetium chemically and is mainly obtained as a by-product of the extraction and refinement of molybdenum and copper ores. Rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) sets <b>Estimated</b> <b>Average</b> Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), or Adequate Intakes (AIs) {{for when}} there is not {{sufficient}} information to set EARs and RDAs. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs {{are referred to as}} Dietary Reference Intakes. The current AI for potassium for women and men ages 14 and up is 4700mg. AI for pregnancy equals 4700mg/day. AI for lactation equals 5100mg/day. For infants 0–6 months 400mg, 6–12 months 700mg, 1–13 years increasing from 3000 to 4500 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM also sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals, but for potassium the evidence was insufficient, so no UL established.|$|E
5|$|Dietary nickel {{may affect}} human health through infections by nickel-dependent bacteria, {{but it is}} also {{possible}} that nickel is an essential nutrient for bacteria residing in the large intestine, in effect functioning as a prebiotic. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level of dietary nickel is 1000µg/day as soluble nickel salts. Dietary intake is estimated at 70 to 100 µg/day, with less than 10% absorbed. What is absorbed is excreted in urine. Relatively large amounts of nickel – comparable to the <b>estimated</b> <b>average</b> ingestion above – leach into food cooked in stainless steel. For example, the amount of nickel leached after 10 cooking cycles into one serving of tomato sauce averages 88µg.|$|E
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a surge in econometric and {{epidemiologic}} works focusing on <b>estimating</b> <b>average</b> treatment effects under various sets of assumptions. Estimation of average treatment effects in observational studies often requires adjustment for differences in pretreatment variables. Rosenbaum and Rubin have proposed the propensity score method for <b>estimating</b> the <b>average</b> treatment effect by adjusting pretreatment variables. In this paper, the empirical likelihood method is used to <b>estimate</b> <b>average</b> treatment effects on the treated under the difference-in-differences framework. The advantage of this approach is that the common marginal covariate information can be incorporated naturally to enhance the estimation of average treatment effects. Compared with other approaches in the literature, the method proposed can provide more efficient estimation. A simulation study and a real economic data analysis are presented.

5|$|Predators {{of adult}} nuthatches include owls and diurnal {{birds of prey}} (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and {{climbing}} snakes such as the western rat snake. The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making hn-hn calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell. The nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The <b>estimated</b> <b>average</b> lifespan of this nuthatch is two years, but the record is twelve years and nine months.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated <b>Estimated</b> <b>Average</b> Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for {{minerals}} in 2001. For manganese {{there was}} not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for Adequate Intakes (AIs). The current AIs for manganese for women and men ages 19 and up are 1.8 and 2.3 mg/day, respectively. AI for pregnancy is 2.0 mg/day. AI for lactation is 2.6 μg/day. For children ages 1–18 years the AI increases with age from 1.2 to 2.2 mg/day for males, to 1.6 mg/day for females. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of manganese the adult UL is set at 11 mg/day.

For children ages 1–18 years the RDA increases with age from 17 to 43 μg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient.

Once a statistical model for the error is identified, {{it can be used to}} <b>estimate</b> <b>average</b> errors from a set of pairs of runs.
