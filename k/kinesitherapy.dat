Spinal pain has triggered interest in many fields of medicine, such as orthopedics, neurology, rheumatology, and rehabilitation. Despite ongoing development of surgery techniques, a major role is played by fitness improvement treatments, which need to be promoted. The aim of the research was a subjective assessment of <b>kinesitherapy</b> as an element of comprehensive rehabilitation process of subjects with lower spine pain. Material/Methods. This paper has an empirical character. The research was conducted amongst a randomly selected group of 60 patients of Independent Public Health Care Unit in Choszczno, Poland (rehabilitation at an outpatients’ clinic), aged 20 - 51. All of them were subjected to a series of 10 <b>kinesitherapy</b> treatments. The research used diagnostic polling method and the following techniques: survey and implicit interview. Results. The research proved that after completion of 10 treatments, the subjects noticed a significant improvement of their health. <b>Kinesitherapy</b> helped return to an active professional life for those who were forced to resign or suspend their work. Subjects reported that 10 <b>kinesitherapy</b> treatments were enough to notice their effectiveness in lumbar spine pain reduction. <b>Kinesitherapy</b> treatments resulted in a reduced usage of painkillers. Conclusions. There is evidence of positive impact of physical exercise on treatment results and beneficial effects in patients with spinal pain.

40|$|Introduction: Guillain-Barré {{syndrome}} is an autoimmune disease characterized by sudden onset and progressive impairment of peripheral nerves. It {{is a rare}} disorder in which weakness and tingling in the extremities are usually the first symptoms. Aim: To study {{the influence of the}} applied <b>kinesitherapy</b> in a patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome with severe and protracted course of the disease by deterioration with Landry ascending paralysis and assisted breathing. Material and Methods: The study was conducted with a female, 34 years old in the subacute stage within two months at home. The <b>kinesitherapy</b> sessions are performed 2 - 3 times per week with 1 -hour duration, moderate intensity, more breaks between exercises without reaching fatigue. We applied correct positioning in bed and seating, passive-active exercises, analytical exercises for upper and lower limbs, breathing exercises, training balance and coordination of sitting and standing and massage techniques. To monitor the effect of <b>kinesitherapy</b> the patient performed twice tests for transfers (turning from lying on his back to the left and right side; lying to sitting and sitting to standing). We use also the test "Five Times Sit To Stand" which is appropriate to assess the possibilities for transfer. Results and Discussion: The results showed an improvement in the speed of response of the patient for changing the body position and transfer due to systematic applying of various therapeutic exercises including exercises for strength of lower limbs and abdominal muscles. The time for performing the test "Five Times Sit To Stand" decreased with 33 sec, which is indicative of the strength of the lower limbs and a big step towards the independence of the patient. The correct position of the body and speed is essential. If the speed of movement of the trunk is less, then it will be a greater loading of the lower extremities. The test also aims to establish coordination and consistency of movements between the trunk and lower limbs.

40|$|Introduction. Knee flexion contractures {{are common}} after-effects of {{juvenile}} arthritis. Treatment is usually conservative and may include physical therapy and <b>kinesitherapy.</b> Surgical treatment, particularly {{of the soft}} parts, indicated for contractures resistant to conservative treatment, helps to correct the deformity, maintain movements, and relieves pain. Intensive postoperative physiotherapy is of special importance. Case report. A 23 -year-old female patient with chronic juvenile arthritis {{since the age of}} one was admitted for treatment of flexion con­tractures in both knees, muscle hypotrophy, loss of strength and gait disability. The patient underwent arthroscopic synovectomy. The operation was first performed on the right and after 3 mouths on the left knee. The pre operative range of motion in the rigth knee was 30 °- 70 ° and in the left 40 °- 80 °. The patient underwent intensive physical therapy to reduce postoperative swelling of knees and firstly passive and then active <b>kinesitherapy.</b> Nine months after the first surgery and six months after the second, the range of motion in the right knee was 0 °- 100 ° and in the left 0 °- 105 °. The strength of tested muscles was increased and gait was improved. Conclusion. Management and rehabilitation of patients with chronic juvenile arthritis include maintenance or improvement in position and function of joints that is achieved with synovectomy. The results depend on combined interdisciplinary rehabilitation, well-experienced staff, and pre- and post-operative physiotherapy as well as <b>kinesitherapy.</b> Arthroscopic synovectomy has many advantages and we believe that it was a better solution than open capsulosynovectomy in this patient with chronic juvenile arthritis of the knee. ...|$|E

The primary task of examining a patient with lumbago is to be certain that the pain is musculoskeletal and unassociated with a potentially dangerous spinal disease requiring emergency special therapy. Objective: to analyze the efficiency of treatment in outpatients with chronic lumbago. Patients and methods. One hundred and four patients followed up by us in the Smolensk <b>Kinesitherapy</b> Center were examined. A study group comprised 84 patients (34 men and 50 women; mean age 44. 2 ± 1. 29 years) with dorsalgia (pain duration ≥ 3 months; mean 7. 6 ± 6. 83 years);a control group included 20 persons (10 men and   10 women; mean age 31. 9 ± 1. 88 years) without pain in the back. Neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging revealed nonspecific lower back pain in 67 (79. 8 %) patients and radiculopathy in 17 (20. 2 %). Combination treatment including pharmacotherapy and <b>kinesitherapy</b> was proposed in all the patients. Results. 2. 5 – 3 months after the initiation of therapy, pain regressed completely in 29 (34. 5 %) patients and was considerably alleviated in 27  (32. 1 %).

Some theories presume that local hypoxia of the soft tissue causes HO. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if the early use of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) could prevent this ossification since it accelerates the circulation and oxigenation of soft tissue. Methods. The study included three groups of the patients with primary THA. The group C consisted of 66 patients/ 79 hips who had only <b>kinesitherapy</b> in postoperative rehabilitation. The group B consisted of 117 patients/ 131 hips who had PEMF and interferential current (IC) which, on average, started on the 14 th day after the surgery combined with the standard <b>kinesitherapy.</b> The group A consisted of 117 patients/ 131 hips who had PEMF from the third postoperative day and IC from, on average, the 14 th postoperative day with the standard <b>kinesitherapy.</b> The classification of HO was done on a standard AP roentgenograms of the hips, taken at least one year after the surgery.

We assessed stroke severity with NIHSS score, upper limb function with ARAT (Action Research Arm Test) score, disability with modified Rankin scale and patient’s autonomy with Barthel Index, at day 0 and day 30 after stroke. After 28 days of combined therapy all 4 patients improved, most significant improvement was seen in upper limb function, measured by ARAT score and in autonomy measured by Barthel Index...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} is {{a chronic}} and progressive neurological illness which is characterized with demyelization {{in the white}} mass of the brain, and with vide and variable spectrum of the neurologic signs. The goal {{of the study is}} to follow trough the influence of the applied neurorehabilitation on a patient with chronic-progressive form of multiple sclerosis. Sources and methods The study is conducted on a 42 years old female patient with a chronic – progressive form of multiple sclerosis in a timeline of one month in domestic conditions. The medicament therapy prescribed by a neurologist includes corticosteroids- Methylprednisolone and Interferon beta 1 a- Avaxone has been used successfully for reduction of the frequency and the weight of the relapses. <b>Kinesitherapy</b> is performed 3 times a week, one hour each time, moderate intensiveness of the stress, more breaks between the exercises, without getting the level of exhaustion. It is used a correct positioning in the bed and in sitting position, passive – active exercises, analytical exercises for upper and lower extremities, breathing exercises, balance and coordination exercises to sitting and standing, massage treatments. To see the effect from the therapy we use Berg balance scale and tests for transfer (changing over from occipital laying position to left/right laying position, from occipital laying position to standing position). The test” Five Times Sit -To- Stand (FTSST) is used, which is suitable for evaluating the abilities of transfer. The changes in the motor activity are monitored twice after discharging from hospital in domestic rehabilitation conditions. Results and discussion With the transfer tests (changing over from occipital laying position to left/right laying position, from occipital laying position to standing position) it can be seen an improvement of the speed in the reaction and the muscle force of the patient, which is due to the systematically conveyed procedures in <b>kinesitherapy</b> and the included exercises for getting force of the lower extremities and the abdominal muscles. The result from the test Five Times Sit -To- Stand (FTSST) is significantly improved, thanks to the improved power of the lower extremities and it is a great step towards the self sufficiency of the patient. The correct position of the thorax and the velocity of the movement are of crucial importance. With this test the coordination and consecutiveness of the movements between the thorax and the lower extremities are evaluated. The improvement of this parameter is due to the described means of <b>kinesitherapy.</b> Conclusion The neurorehabilitation is shown as an effective way to the decreasing of these symptoms through the improvement of the functional performances and the independence of the patient. Until now there hasn`t been a suitable therapy which would stop the process of demyelization, which has brought to invalidity of patients in the years of their highest activity and productiveness. The drugs and multi-disciplinary <b>kinesitherapy</b> it has shown as an effective combination in decreasing the relapses, decreasing the functional disability which contributes to the improvement of the quality of life.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to trace the {{correlation}} between dynamic balance and gait parameters during the application of specialized kinesitherapeutic methodology (SKTM) in patients with ischemic stroke in the chronic period (ISChP) which is developed on the grounds of the principles of motor control, motor learning and modern guidelines for neurodevelopment treatment (NDT). 	 Material and Methods The study was conducted with 56 patients with ISChP. The Berg Balance Scale is used for the evaluation of the balance reactions. Tracking changes in gait before and after the applied treatment is evaluated cadence of gait and maximum speed of movement. To determine the cadence, the number of steps is measured for covering 6 meters and 10 meters. The maximum speed of the gait is determined in m / min by dividing undergone distance (m) / time (min), for which they have walked it. All indicators were assessed at the baseline, on the 10 th day, 1 st month and 3 rd months after the beginning of the <b>kinesitherapy.</b> The patients studied were treated with a specialized 10 -day <b>kinesitherapy,</b> which later continues to be performed by patients as an adapted exercise program at home for a period of three months. Results After applying SKTM, the highest tendency towards improvement in dynamic balance and gait is established in the 1 st month, with a level of significance p = 0. 000. The correlations between the studied parameters were most visible on the 10 th day after the start of the applied SKTM with a significance level of p< 0. 01. Conclusion The applied specialized kinesitherapeutic methodology continued later as an adapted exercise program at home, significantly improving the dynamic balance and gait parameters in patients with functional impairment due to ISChP.
