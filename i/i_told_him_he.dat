The video was shot between those of [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] and [...] "Green Light", and took about one and half days of filming. Jay-Z performed his rap scenes first, [...] afterwards Knowles studied his scene, and then did her impersonation of him. Melina said: [...] "If anybody knows Jay-Z, it would be Beyoncé". Knowles commented on her impersonation of Jay-Z on MTV, [...] "I love what I did in [...] because it's completely out of my character, {{or at least the}} character that people think I am. I was pretending to be Jay, and he was there, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> had to leave, because I couldn't do it with him in the room — it was way too embarrassing. I think I did a pretty good job. I had the lip curl down!" [...] The video premiered on February 28, 2007, on BET's 106 & Park, with the video for Knowles' other single release, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] (2007) featuring Shakira, premiering the same day on Total Request Live (TRL).|$|E
500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant {{there would be}} someone ready {{in the event that}} Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. [...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>He</b> said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. If I can help you in any way, call me." ...|$|E

500|$|Soaps In Depth {{reported}} that Engen quickly gained viewer support after joining the cast as Adam, {{as did the}} character's romance with Heather. The support continued when the character took a dark turn. Engen said, [...] "To {{think there was any}} likability left in the character baffles me! I'm very grateful to the fans...they've been so supportive." [...] The actor said fans wanted Adam either redeemed or turned into a gray character. Davidson credited the character's likability to Engen's looks, saying, [...] "...he really nailed this character. Chris' all-American looks add another layer to this story: he looks like he regrets being so evil, but he can't help himself. When Chris informed me he was leaving, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> really accomplished something by being so likable playing this villain." [...] Nelson Branco repeatedly praised Engen's acting and Adam's storyline with Ashley and Victor, saying, [...] "he Haunting of Ashley is fast becoming one of my favorite all-time soap storylines ever. It's so 1970s. I have no doubt former Another World master scribe and Paul Rauch BFF/frenemy, Harding Lemay, is freaking if he's watching this gothic, macabre and super-creepy mystery. Moreover, camp-ilicious Chris Engen (Adam) is stealing the story with his very bitchy, and sexy performance of a deranged son scorned." [...] Soaps In Depth also commended Adam's storyline. The magazine awarded Engen a gold star for portraying Adam as a gray character with [...] "sardonic humor". Soap Opera Digest named Engen [...] "performer of the week" [...] for his final scenes as Adam, saying the actor [...] "gave a performance that elevated Adam from an average villain to a complex mastermind".|$|E

Carlyle described a dinner at Mitchel's house in 1846, saying that Mitchel was [...] "a fine elastic-spirited young fellow, whom I grieved to see rushing to destruction palpable by attack of windmills, but upon whom all my persuasions were thrown away". Carlyle later said, when Mitchel was on trial, [...] "Irish Mitchel, poor fellow… <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> {{would most likely}} be hanged, but I told him, too, {{that they could not}} hang the immortal part of him." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{incident}} occurred in April 1926 and {{became known as}} Der Vorfall Haidbauer (the Haidbauer incident). Josef Haidbauer was an 11-year-old pupil whose father had died and whose mother worked as a local maid. He was a slow learner, and one day Wittgenstein hit him {{two or three times}} on the head, causing him to collapse. Wittgenstein carried him to the headmaster's office, then quickly left the school, bumping into a parent, Herr Piribauer, on the way out. Piribauer had been sent for by the children when they saw Haidbauer collapse; Wittgenstein had previously pulled Piribauer's daughter, Hermine, so hard by the ears that her ears had bled. Piribauer said that when he met Wittgenstein in the hall that day: [...] "I called him all the names under the sun. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> wasn't a teacher, he was an animal-trainer! And that I was going to fetch the police right away!" ...|$|E
