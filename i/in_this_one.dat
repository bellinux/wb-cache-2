5|$|During {{the night}} of 21 January 1971, a force of 100 PAVN/Viet Cong commandos {{attacked}} Pochentong airfield, the main base of the Khmer Air Force. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> action, the raiders destroyed almost the entire inventory of government aircraft, including all of its fighter planes. This {{may have been a}} blessing in disguise, however, since the air force was largely composed of old (even obsolete) Soviet aircraft. The Americans soon replaced the airplanes with more advanced models. The attack did, however, stall a proposed FANK offensive. Two weeks later, Lon Nol suffered a stroke and was evacuated to Hawaii for treatment. It had been a mild stroke, however, and the general recovered quickly, returning to Cambodia after only two months.|$|E
5|$|The first match began under a {{cloud of}} Grace-inspired {{controversy}} on Thursday, 20 June at The Oval, where Gloucestershire were beaten by 16 runs. Surrey made 150 (Grace 4–43) and 136 (Grace 6–70), but Gloucestershire's response was 111 (Grace 40) and 159 (Grace 31). This was a fine all-round performance by Grace, though {{he would not have}} been happy with two more innings under 50, and it serves to illustrate just how much Gloucestershire depended on him. The next match at Hove began the following Monday, 24 June, and Gloucestershire won by an innings and 67 runs after losing the toss and being asked to field. Sussex were all out for 93 (Grace 0–21) and 71 (Grace 4–13); in between, Gloucestershire made 231 despite Grace scoring a duck. His brothers did the batting <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> Fred scoring 71 and E. M. 53.|$|E

5|$|Umar {{is said to}} have later regretted this decision. It is {{said that}} after the Hajj of 642, Umar had decided to re-appoint Khalid to the {{military}} services, apparently to command the Muslim conquest of Persia that was to begin shortly. But fate had decided otherwise, as when he reached Medina, news of Khalid's death reached him. The news of Khalid's death broke like a storm over Medina. The women took to the streets, led by the women of the Banu Makhzum (Khalid's tribe), wailing and beating their chests. Though Umar, from the very first day had given orders {{that there would be no}} wailing for departed Muslims, as forbidden in Islam, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> case he made an exception.|$|E
25|$|Dawkins {{finishes}} {{by arguing}} that atheism is not a recipe for despair but just the opposite; rather than viewing life as a trial that must be endured before reaching a mythical hereafter, an atheist sees this life as all we have, and by disclaiming a next life can take more excitement <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>one.</b> Atheism, Dawkins concludes, is life-affirming {{in a way that}} religion can never be.|$|E

This subdividing was most likely done by librarians and archivists, themselves being historians and scholars, most likely working in the Library of Alexandria.|$|E

It formed the basis for some early merchandise in the US in the 1960s, such as a popular model kit by Aurora Plastics Corporation, and a popular board game by Ideal Toys. This game was released alongside a King Kong game in 1963 to coincide with the US theatrical release of the film.|$|E
25|$|By 1938 he had {{qualified}} by residence to {{play for}} Northamptonshire, where his New Zealand Test colleague Ken James had settled as wicket-keeper. In his one full season for the county, 1939, he scored 926 runs and took 87 wickets, though <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> English season of eight-ball overs he was conceding runs at almost five an over. He was instrumental, with 12 wickets, in enabling Northamptonshire to record their first victory in first-class cricket for almost four years, against Cambridge University, and followed that up with six wickets in an innings when, in the same month of May 1939, the team beat another county (Leicestershire) {{for the first time}} since May 1935.|$|E
25|$|The third {{regional}} final matched up the top seeded North Carolina Tar Heels and {{the sixth}} seeded Badgers from Wisconsin. The Tar Heels started off hot <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> as Sean May and Rashad McCants scored at will. When point guard Raymond Felton garnered his second foul, head coach Roy Williams decided {{to pull him}} to prevent further foul trouble. Up 11 at the time, {{it seemed to be}} the right move. Wisconsin would prove Williams wrong as they finished the half on an 11-0 run, tying the game at 44 heading into the half. The Tar Heels struggled to start the second half as hot as the first and trailed {{for the first time since}} the opening minutes of the game. Sparked by May's 29 points and 11 boards and Felton's clutch free throws, they outlasted the Badgers and won the game by six in regulation.|$|E

25|$|Susa I {{style was}} very much a product of the past and of {{influences}} from contemporary ceramic industries in the mountains of western Iran. The recurrence in close association of vessels of three types—a drinking goblet or beaker, a serving dish, and a small jar—implies the consumption of three types of food, apparently thought to be as necessary for life in the afterworld as it is <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>one.</b> Ceramics of these shapes, which were painted, constitute {{a large proportion of the}} vessels from the cemetery. Others are coarse cooking-type jars and bowls with simple bands painted on them and were probably the grave goods of the sites of humbler citizens as well as adolescents and, perhaps, children. The pottery is carefully made by hand. Although a slow wheel may have been employed, the asymmetry of the vessels and the irregularity of the drawing of encircling lines and bands indicate that most of the work was done freehand.|$|E
25|$|On Wednesday, 27 August, the Australians {{were at the}} Clifton College Close Ground and {{its strong}} {{associations}} with W. G. Grace, {{who had died in}} the autumn of the bleak year of 1915, to play Gloucestershire. This was another two-day match and another drawn two-day match, but it was Gloucestershire, not the AIF, who were cheated of time <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>one.</b> They won the toss and batted, scoring 281 (Charlie Townsend 63, Alf Dipper 61) and then reduced the AIF to 104 for six at close of play. On the second morning, the AIF were all out for 147 and asked to follow on. Gloucestershire's great left arm spinner Charlie Parker did the damage with seven for 70. In the second innings, the Australians were struggling against the medium pace of Dipper, bowling in tandem with Parker, but thanks to a determined effort by Bill Trenerry they managed to hold on for the draw.|$|E
25|$|Picasso was {{resolved}} {{to undo the}} continuities of form and field which Western art had so long taken for granted. The famous stylistic rupture at right {{turned out to be}} merely a consummation. Overnight, the contrived coherences of representational art - the feigned unities of time and place, the stylistic consistencies - all were declared to be fictional. The Demoiselles confessed itself a picture conceived in duration and delivered in spasms. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> work Picasso discovered that the demands of discontinuity could be met on multiple levels: by cleaving depicted flesh; by elision of limbs and abbreviation; by slashing the web of connecting space; by abrupt changes of vantage; and by a sudden stylistic shift at the climax. Finally, the insistent staccato of the presentation was found to intensify the picture's address and symbolic charge: the beholder, instead of observing a roomfuI of lazing whores, is targeted from all sides. So far from suppressing the subject, the mode of organization heightens its flagrant eroticism.|$|E

25|$|The MCC stopped off on {{the journey}} between Melbourne and Sydney to play another Bush game. The local team won the toss and Max Rudd made 82 adding 139 {{for the first two}} wickets. Unfortunately John Murray was {{standing}} up to the wicket to Geoff Pullar's rare bowling and the future Australian Wallabies international Ken McMullen caught him with the end of his bat while hooking the ball to the boundary. Murray was helped off the field and needed three stitches in his forehead, but reports that his jaw had been broken and that his tour was over were exaggerated. Ted Dexter was the best bowler with 2/29 and Southern New South Wales declared on 186/6 <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> innings, one day game. The MCC made the runs despite losing David Sheppard, Peter Parfitt and Tom Graveney as Geoff Pullar made 81 in 66 minutes and Dexter 108 in 71 minutes with 3 sixes and 13 fours. They passed the winning line with the score on 187/3, but carried on batting {{for the rest of the}} day's play to finish with 272/6.|$|E
25|$|Floyd and Richetti were {{alleged to}} have been Miller's accomplices. Factors {{weighing}} against them included their apparent presence in Kansas City at the time, eyewitness identifications (which have been contested), Richetti's fingerprint {{said to have been}} recovered from a beer bottle at Miller's hideout, an underworld account naming Floyd and Richetti as the gunmen, and Hoover's firm advocacy of their guilt. Fellow bank robber Alvin Karpis, an acquaintance of Floyd's, claimed that Floyd confessed involvement to him. On {{the other side of the}} issue, the bandit {{alleged to have}} been Floyd was supposed to have been wounded by a gunshot to the shoulder in the attack, and Floyd's body showed no sign of this injury when examined later. The underworld account identifying Floyd and Richetti as the killers was offset by equally unreliable underworld accounts proclaiming their innocence or identifying others. The Floyd family has maintained that while Floyd admitted to many other crimes, he vehemently denied involvement <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> as did Richetti. It has also been contended that this crime would have been inconsistent with Floyd's other criminal acts, as he was not otherwise known as a hired gun or (especially) a hired killer.|$|E
