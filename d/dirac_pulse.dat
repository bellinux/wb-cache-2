40|$|International audienceScattering centers model (SCM) {{is usually}} {{considered}} for modeling target backscattered signal in high-resolution radar. In {{this case the}} impulse response of each scattering center is represented by a time-delayed <b>Dirac</b> <b>pulse.</b> Some of most popular superresolution imagery techniques, such as MUSIC or ESPRIT, are well-matched to this model. Under this hypothesis, they outperform Fourier-based techniques {{in terms of both}} spatial and dynamic resolutions. However, the behavior of real-world targets is often very {{different from that of the}} SCM. Indeed, their reflectivity function is not confined just to several perfectly localized scattering centers, but it can be rather approximated by a set of scattering regions having different spatial extent. SCM becomes then inappropriate and the superresolution methods may provide unexpected results. Furthermore, the amplitude information is difficult to interpret in this case. In this paper we propose an extension of two superresolution methods, MUSIC and ESPRIT, to cope with extended scattering centers (ESC). According to this model, the impulse response of an ESC is not a <b>Dirac</b> <b>pulse,</b> but a window of finite support. Besides the position, the size (spatial extent) of this window is also recovered.

40|$|We {{present a}} new method {{to capture the}} finite-size effects induced by {{particles}} transported by a fluid flow, with a low computational cost compared to available fully-resolved methods, thus allowing to tackle configurations with high volume fractions of particles. The basic idea consists in tracking a source/sink of momentum occurring within a compact support of the mesh, centered on the particle and taking {{the form of a}} mollified Dirac kernel, or blob. In the spirit of the immersed boundary method, the shape and the intensity of the kernel are found by imposing appropriate reproducing conditions on the blob (to model accurately a <b>Dirac</b> <b>pulse)</b> and spreading on the mesh cells a volume force determined by the desired boundary condition. The particles occupy a finite-size volume of fluid, therefore introducing a two-way coupled behavior, for the computational cost of only one Lagrangian point. To build the blobs, we will either spread a zero-velocity condition at the blob center, or spread a zero-velocity condition averaged on the fluid parcel enclosed within the support. Both methods are discussed and validated by comparing with free falling fully-resolved particles, in 2 D and 3 D...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Linear lossy two-conductor {{transmission}} {{line can be}} modelled as dynamic two ports in the time domain, via the describing input and transfer impulse responses. This convolution technique is very effective when dealing with networks composed of {{transmission line}}s with frequency-dependent parameters and non-linear and/or time-varying circuits. The paper carries out an accurate analysis of this model, in the most general case of lines with frequency-dependent parameters. For such lines {{it is not possible}} to evaluate analytically the impulse responses, nor is it possible to catch them numerically, due to the presence of irregular terms, such as <b>Dirac</b> <b>pulses,</b> terms that numerically behave as <b>Dirac</b> <b>pulses,</b> and functions of the type 1 /t with 0 < < 1. A simple method is proposed to evaluate exactly all the irregular terms of the impulse responses: once these irregular parts have been extracted, the regular remainders are easily evaluated numerically. This method is applied to analyse lines with frequency-dependent parameters of practical interest, such as superconductor transmission lines, power lines above a finite conductivity ground, lines with frequency-dependent dielectric losses and lines with normal and anomalous skin-effect. Numerical simulations are carried out for illustration. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
