5|$|In {{its early}} stages, esophageal cancer {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. <b>Inserting</b> <b>a</b> stent into the esophagus, or <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Caltrans {{proposed}} {{the installation of}} a metered traffic signal on I-8 west in Lakeside during 1987, {{in order to improve}} traffic flow in the mornings by <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> short delay before entering San Diego should the rate exceed 2,000vehicles per hour. However, the state put its plans on hold shortly thereafter, following several concerns from the public, and from state senator Jim Ellis.|$|E
5|$|Seddon {{thought that}} the church had once been much more elaborate, like the South doorway, and {{proposed}} <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> matching West crossing arch, and also more a complex spire, but this was opposed by Bishop Basil Jones, and was abandoned. Seddon also proposed replacing all the roofs in a steeper pitch, thinking the existing ones were poor sixteenth century work. This was done, except that the fifteenth century chancel roof was retained between the new roof and the ceiling.|$|E

5|$|Zappa {{was often}} sick as a child, {{suffering}} from asthma, earaches and sinus problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> pellet of radium {{into each of}} Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation, and although it has since been claimed that nasal radium treatment has causal connections to cancer, no studies have provided significant enough evidence to confirm this.|$|E
5|$|A major 18-month {{redevelopment}} of {{the square}} led by W.S. Atkins with Foster and Partners as sub-consultants was completed in 2003. The work involved closing the eastbound road along the north side and diverting traffic around the other three sides {{of the square}}, demolishing the central section of the northern retaining wall and <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> wide set of steps to the pedestrianised terrace {{in front of the}} National Gallery. The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets and a caf√©. Access between the square and the gallery had been by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners.|$|E
5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture, and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E
30|$|Difficulty <b>inserting</b> <b>an</b> {{intravenous}} catheter because of redundant skin and hypertrichosis on the limbs {{would be a}} common problem in general anesthesia for patients with BSS. In our case, senior anesthesiologists tried to <b>insert</b> <b>an</b> additional {{intravenous catheter}}, but the attempts ended in failure. It seems to be essential that a pediatric anesthetic expert <b>insert</b> <b>an</b> intravenous catheter before the induction of general anesthesia to avoid slow induction in patients with BSS.|$|R

5|$|In a large PSP (>50%), or in a PSP {{associated}} with breathlessness, some guidelines recommend that reducing the size by aspiration is equally effective as {{the insertion of}} a chest tube. This involves the administration of local anesthetic and <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> needle connected to a three-way tap; up to 2.5liters of air (in adults) are removed. If there has been significant reduction {{in the size of}} the pneumothorax on subsequent X-ray, the remainder of the treatment can be conservative. This approach has been shown to be effective in over 50% of cases. Compared to tube drainage, first-line aspiration in PSP reduces the number of people requiring hospital admission, without increasing the risk of complications.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} to find himself {{strapped}} to a table, where Ben, Tom (M. C. Gainey) and two other Others watch over him. Sawyer is gagged before <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> large hypodermic needle into his chest. When Sawyer awakens, Ben enters, carrying a rabbit in a cage; he shakes the cage vigorously, causing the rabbit to suddenly collapse, presumably dead. Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him, like the rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his heart would explode. Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer should tell her of his ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{innovations}} in business {{caused by the}} use of the nickel in coin-operated machines was the automat, in which patrons would serve themselves by <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> coin (initially a nickel, though by the 1950s a higher denomination was needed) into a mechanism, turning a handle, and removing a sandwich or dessert. These restaurants were first established in Germany, but were popularized in the United States by, among other firms, Horn & Hardart. A type of business which took its name from the coin was the nickelodeon cinema, where a nickel bought admission to view a series of one-reel short films, generally about 12minutes in length, which ran continuously from early afternoon until late at night, with the patron free to remain as long as he liked. Although another denomination gave the penny arcade its name, the nickel was commonly used there as well.|$|E

5|$|The Peasants' Revolt {{became a}} popular {{literary}} subject. The poet John Gower, who had {{close ties to}} officials involved in {{the suppression of the}} revolt, amended his famous poem Vox Clamantis after the revolt, <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> section condemning the rebels and likening them to wild animals. Geoffrey Chaucer, who lived in Aldgate and may have been in London during the revolt, used the rebel killing of Flemings as a metaphor for wider disorder in The Nun's Priest's Tale part of The Canterbury Tales, parodying Gower's poem. Chaucer otherwise made no reference to the revolt in his work, possibly because as he was a client of the King it would have been politically unwise to discuss it. William Langland, the author of the poem Piers Plowman, which had been widely used by the rebels, made various changes to its text after the revolt in order to distance himself from their cause.|$|E
5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (<b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E
