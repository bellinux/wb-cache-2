40|$|Abstract: As {{a part of}} an {{innovation}} project funded by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highways for LIFE program, a full-depth precast, ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) waffle <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> and appropriate connections suitable for field implementation of waffle decks were developed. Following a successful full-scale validation test on a unit consisting of two panels with various types of connections under laboratory conditions, the waffle deck was installed successfully on a replacement bridge in Wapello County, Iowa. The subsequent load testing confirmed the desirable performance of the UHPC waffle deck bridge. Using the lessons from the completed project and outcomes {{from a series of}} simple and detailed finite element analyses of waffle decks, this report was developed to serve as a guide for broadening the design and installation of the UHPC waffle <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> in new and existing bridges. Following an introduction to UHPC and waffle <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> and a summary of completed work, this document presents information on waffle deck design, design of connections, redecking using waffle <b>deck</b> <b>panels,</b> and guidance on precast fabrication, construction, and installation of UHPC waffle <b>deck</b> <b>panels...</b>|$|R
40|$|The use of precast {{concrete}} <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> {{is becoming increasingly}} popular for bridge construction and rehabilitation {{in the state of}} Utah and across the country. It allows for the use of full depth concrete <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> but removes the long construction times of traditional cast-in-place methods. One of the challenges to the use of precast <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> is the transverse <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> joints that exist between the panels. These joints are unreinforced using traditional methods and therefore are the weakest section of the bridge. In many situations the joint will fail and water seeps through and can damage the bridge superstructure. Post-tensioning of precast decks has become the standard. The post-tensioning provides reinforcing through the joints, reducing the cracking that occurs. Additionally, the post-tensioning provides pressure along the joint and closes cracks that have occurred, therefore preventing water from leaking through to the superstructure and damaging it. The Utah Department of Transportation uses post-tensioning cables that run {{along the length of the}} bridge deck, applying pressure on the joints. One of the problems with using this method is it does not allow for the replacement of a single <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> should the need arise. Utah State University has been researching a new post-tensioned connection that would allow for the replacement of a single <b>deck</b> <b>panel.</b> The “curved bolt” connection connects each <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> to adjacent panels, providing reinforcement and post-tensioning along the joint. Laboratory testing was undertaken to investigate the effects of single panel bridge rehabilitation on the existing deck system...|$|R
40|$|The first {{generation}} of precast concrete deck system, NUDECK, was implemented on the Skyline Bridge, Omaha, NE in 2004. The second generation of NUDECK system was developed to further simplify the system and improve its constructability and durability. The new generation consists of full-width full-depth precast concrete <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> that are 12 ft long to minimize the number of <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> and transverse joints, and consequently accelerate bridge construction. It also uses covered individual pockets and bundled shear connectors at 4 ft spacing to simplify panel and girder production and {{eliminate the need for}} deck overlay. Precast <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> are pre-tensioned in transverse direction and post-tensioned in the longitudinal direction to enhance deck durability. Post-tensioning strands are placed underneath the <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> (at the haunch area) to eliminate threading strands through ducts and grouting operations. The objective of this project is to investigate the constructability of the 2 nd generation NUDECK system through full-scale testing of two key features: 1) using self-consolidating concrete (SCC) to fill the gap between precast concrete <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> and bridge girders as well as covered deck pockets; and 2) using the proposed deviators and anchorage block in the end <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> for post-tensioning the bridge deck. These investigations includes evaluating the pumpability/pouring of the developed SCC mixture in mockup and full-scale specimens. Sequence of pumping/pouring of SCC as well as its quality control and quality assurance procedures are also demonstrated. The investigations also include pullout testing of the deviators and pushoff testing of the anchorage block used for post-tensioning to evaluate their performance and refine their reinforcement details...|$|R

40|$|Five {{localized}} {{punching shear}} failures occurred on important precast <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> bridges in southwest Florida. This {{was attributed to}} the use of compressible fiberboard for supporting the precast panels. This paper describes the in-depth investigation undertaken to understand the cause of failure and the subsequent development of a deterioration model for identifying at-risk <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> bridges. This was based on a comprehensive review of historical inspection records, bridge plans, special reports, on-site forensic investigation of bridges being replaced and interviews with inspectors. The qualitative deterioration model identified 13 stages leading to failure and was successfully used to prioritize the planned replacement of 85 precast <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> bridges over ten years. The validity of the model was proven by subsequent punching shear failures of two more precast <b>panel</b> <b>deck</b> bridges, both included in the top ten at-risk bridge list. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{alternate}} to cast-in-place bridge decks are prefabricated, full-depth precast concrete <b>deck</b> <b>panels.</b> These panels {{can be constructed}} off-site under controlled conditions in a precast plant and brought to the bridge site ready to be installed and connected. This requires significantly less on-site construction work and ensures minimum traffic interference. In many urban situations, a bridge can be rebuilt using night or weekend closures or staged construction to maintain traffic in both directions. The benefits of precast full-depth bridge <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> include: durable high quality materials; minimal on-site construction and traffic disruption; increased safety for construction crews and the public; and minimal adverse economic impact due to road closures. This paper summarizes many of the findings in a “State-of-the-Art Report on Full Depth Precast Concrete Bridge <b>Deck</b> <b>Panels</b> ” [1].

40|$|In 1977, the Weyerhaeuser Company {{developed}} {{a system for}} short-span timber bridges. The girder-free system consisted of longitudinal, vertically-laminated glulam panels joined by below-deck Transverse Stiffener Beams (TSB). This project addresses two potential areas of improvement in the construction and design of these bridges: a reinforced <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> and an improved method for TSB design. This project has two objectives: (1) To evaluate the behavior and advantages of longitudinal glulam <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> reinforced with Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (FRP) and (2) To evaluate existing AASHTO empirical TSB design criteria.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of the}} {{research}} is design and analysis of new bridge <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> made of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP). Use of GFRP in construction is rapidly growing in last few years. The reason for use GFRP is its low self weight in compare of strength and high resistance against weather influenced degradation resulting in long life. Using GFRP for the construction of the bridge deck leads to lightweight construction that can pass the required wheel load. Lightweight design is appreciated for temporary bridge which is expected to be transported and assembled often on places of current need. Long durability and resistance against weather degradation also reduces maintenance costs of bridge deck. Design of <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> will be done on the base of loading experiments and FEM analysis.

40|$|As {{the aging}} bridges and {{infrastructure}} within the US continue to deteriorate, traffic delays due to construction {{will become more}} and more common. One method that can reduce delays due to bridge construction is to use precast <b>deck</b> <b>panels.</b> Precast <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> can significantly reduce the overall length of the construction project. The panels can be manufactured ahead of time, and with higher quality control than is possible in the field. One of the reasons precast <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> are not widely accepted is {{because of a lack of}} research concerning the required post-tensioning force, shear stud pocket placement, and proper joint design. In a recent dissertation (Swenty 2009) numerous recommendations were made for joint design, shear stud pocket design, and post-tensioning force for full-depth precast <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> bridges. Design drawings were included for the replacement of a bridge located in Scott County, Virginia. The research in this report focuses on the short-term and long-term testing of this bridge. The short-term testing involved performing a live load test in which two trucks of known weight and dimensions were positioned on the bridge in order to maximize the negative moment at the joints over the piers and document strains and deflections at a number of other critical locations. The long-term testing involved monitoring the strains within the deck and on one of the six girders for a number of months in order t...|$|R
40|$|In July 2006, {{construction}} {{began on}} an accelerated bridge project in Boone County, Iowa that {{was composed of}} precast substructure elements and an innovative, precast <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> system. The superstructure system consisted of full-depth <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> that were prestressed in the transverse direction, and after installation on the prestressed concrete girders, post-tensioned in the longitudinal direction. Prior to construction, laboratory tests were completed on the precast abutment and pier cap elements. The substructure testing {{was to determine the}} punching shear strength of the elements. Post-tensioning testing and verification of the precast deck system was performed in the field. The forces in the tendons provided by the contractor were verified and losses due to the post-tensioning operation were measured. The stress (strain) distribution in the <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> due to the post-tensioning was also measured and analyzed. The entire construction process for this bridge system was documented. Representatives from the Boone County Engineers Office, the prime contractor, precast fabricator, and researchers from Iowa State University provided feedback and suggestions for improving the constructability of this design...|$|R
40|$|Stiffened panels play a {{significant}} role in marine industry because of their high strength-weight ratio, they account for {{a significant}} amount of a vessel’s weight. Hence, weight optimization of these structures can reduce the material costs and to a great extent increase the cargo capacity of a vessel. This thesis looks into the performance of three steel car <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> with respect to their weights for a Pure Car and Truck Carrier (PCTC). The focus is on the structural arrangement rather than a comparison of steel and alternative materials, since lightweight materials are still not economically viable for these types of ships. Two of the car <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> have conventional structural arrangement stiffened with longitudinal and transverse stiffeners while the third one uses diagonally positioned beams. In order to carry out a consistent comparison, the car <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> are optimized by means of finite element analysis and parametric sensitivity analysis.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{investigation of}} the use of ultrasonic consolidation (UC) to produce <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> for small satellites was undertaken. Several fabrication methods for producing structural <b>panels</b> and <b>decking</b> were analyzed. Because of its ability to create aluminum objects in an additive fashion, and at near-room temperatures, UC was found to be a powerful solution for creating highly integrated and modular satellite panels. It also allowed a lightweight and stiff deck to be fabricated without the use of adhesives. A series of experiments were performed to understand the issues associated with creating a sandwich-type structure using UC. The experiments used a peel test apparatus to evaluate the bond strength for various geometric configurations and materials. Aluminum 3003 was chosen as the sole material constituting the <b>deck</b> <b>panel.</b> The honeycomb lattice was found to offer the best core configuration due to its ability to resist vibration from the sonotrode and provide adequate support for pressure induced by the sonotrode. Support materials for enhancing the bonding of the facings to the core were investigated but did not lead to implementation. A CAD model was created to integrate the honeycomb core, facings, and modular bolt pattern into the ultrasonically consolidated structure. The model was used to develop a build procedure for fabricating the deck on the UC machine. A finite element analysis was performed that used an equivalent properties method to represent the deck. The stiffness of a prototype deck was evaluated in a three-point bending test and the results were found to correlate with the finite element model. A sine sweep vibration test was then performed on the prototype <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> to measure its natural frequencies. Finally, a case study was performed on a deck built for the TOROID spacecraft. A final <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> was designed using the results from the prototype. The deck included the USUSat bolt pattern, vented honeycomb, and a reinforced rim. The cost and benefits of the final <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> versus traditional fabrication methods were outlined...|$|R

40|$|The {{overarching}} goal of {{this study}} was to perform a comprehensive evaluation of various issues related to the strength and serviceability of the FRP <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> that are available in the industry. Specific objectives were to establish critical limit states to be considered in the design of FRP <b>deck</b> <b>panel,</b> to provide performance specifications to designers, and to develop evaluation techniques for the <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> in service. Two different FRP panels were studied during the research project: a sandwich panel and a pultruded panel. The sandwich panel was initially selected for the rehabilitation case study bridge. However, for a variety of reasons outside of the scope of this study, both the sandwich panel and the initial case study bridge were dropped from consideration. A new case study bridge was selected, and new proposals from FRP deck manufacturers were solicited. At that time, the pultruded deck was selected. Analysis and experimental results related to both FRP <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> are included in this report, as information from both decks is relevant to the overarching {{goal of this}} study. In November 2009, Sugar Creek Bridge became the first bridge in Indiana to be rehabilitated with an FRP bridge deck. An extensive study, including literature review, analysis, and load tests, suggest that the installed deck should perform well, with web buckling as the ultimate failure mode at a factor of safety of 5. Deflection limits, generally an issue with FRP decks, are satisfied with the installed deck. Meanwhile, some combination of acoustic emission methods, infrared thermography and a newly developed traveling truck deflection method show promise for non-destructive evaluation of the deck in-situ and identification of damage such as delamination of the wearing surface or web buckling. However, such methods have shown variability and could be prohibitively labor-intensive. Therefore, further evaluation is needed if such methods are to be pursued...|$|R

40|$|Accelerated bridge {{construction}} has quickly become the preferred method for the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) {{as well as}} many other DOT’s across the United States. This type of construction requires the use of full depth precast panels for the construction of the bridge deck. The segmented <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> produce transverse joints between panels and have {{come to be known as}} the weakest portion of the deck. Cracking often occurs at these joints and is reflected through the deck overlay where water accesses and begins corrosion of the reinforcement and superstructure below. For this reason post-tensioning of the <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> is becoming a regular practice to ensure that the deck behaves more monolithically, limiting cracking. The current post-tensioning used by UDOT inhibits future replacement of single <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> and requires that all panels be replaced once one panel is deemed defective. The new curved bolt connection provides the necessary compressive stresses across the transverse joints but makes future replacement of a single <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> possible without replacing the entire bridge deck. To better understand the behavior of the new curved bolt connection under loadings, laboratory testing was undertaken on both the curved bolt and the current post-tensioning used by UDOT. The testing specimens included full-scale, full-depth, precast panels that were connected using both system. The testing induced typical stresses on the panels and connections, subjecting them to negative bending and shear. The overall performance of the curved bolt proved satisfactory. The moment capacity of both connections surpassed all theoretical calculations. The yield and plastic moments were 17 % and 16 % lower, respectively, than the UDOT post-tension system while at those moments deflection was relatively the same. Due to the anchorage location of the curved bolts, the reinforcement around the transverse joint received up to 5 times the strain of that of the post-tension connections. Although both systems performed well when subjected to shear forces and as compared to the theoretical capacities, the post-tension connection greatly surpassed the curved bolt in shear capacity...|$|R

40|$|Glue {{laminated}} wood deck systems {{are commonly used}} for bridge decks on girder bridge systems. These decks are usually covered with a hot-mix asphalt wearing surface {{in conjunction with a}} bituminized fabric sheet waterproofing membrane. Often cracks occur in the asphalt at the intersection of two adjacent <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> which limits the useful life of the wear surface, provides a poor riding surface and potentially allows moisture to flow to wooden bridge components. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the structural behavior of asphalt/wood/membrane deck systems. This was accomplished experimentally by determining the deflection of bridge <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> with respect to each other under simulated truck loading. A classical linear analysis model and a finite element analysis model were developed for the <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> deflections. These analytical results were compared to the experimental results and a value of approximately 0. 05 in for the interpanel differential deflection was determined to be a reasonable, conservative value for the typical configuration considered. This deflection was then used to load various asphalt/membrane/wood configurations to investigate the effectiveness of the arrangement with regards to resisting hot-mix asphalt cracking. It was found that when subjected to repeated deflections of 0. 05 in, the following experimental composite bridge deck performed best in terms of reduced cracking: 1) hot-mix asphalt base layer applied directly onto the glulam deck panel; 2) waterproofing membrane placed on the base layer of asphalt; 3) hot-mix asphalt surface layer placed on the waterproofing membrane. ii ACKNOWLEDGMENT...|$|R

Different concept designs where the steel top plate was replaced by an aluminium structure were evaluated by utilizing engineering beam theory, goal driven optimization and finite element analysis. The evaluation resulted in a steel/aluminium car deck design with extruded aluminium profiles as a stiffened top plate and a conventional steel beam system structure as support. The final design of the larger car <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> resulted in a weight reduction of 7. 5 % while the smaller car <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> was weight reduced with 28. 7 %.

40|$|The current {{edition of}} the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) {{provides}} limited guidance {{for the design of}} composite bridges with precast concrete <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> and steel girders. The shear connection is critical in determining the overall performance of the composite superstructure and is commonly achieved with a grout blockout in a precast concrete <b>deck</b> <b>panel,</b> which accepts a cluster of tightly spaced steel shear studs. No specific equations are found in the CHBDC for the design of shear studs used in this system. Furthermore, the current longitudinal spacing limitation of 600 mm for shear studs in the CHBDC is not conducive to the construction of precast concrete decks where an increased spacing of the stud cluster is desirable. An experimental testing regime was conducted using push-test specimens constructed with precast concrete panels connected to steel flanges with steel studs within a circular grout pocket. Specimens were tested to failure to determine the ultimate capacity of a stud cluster and to investigate the reduction in ultimate strength after cyclic loading. A 36 m simple span composite superstructure was designed to the CHBDC. A parametric study is being conducted on the spacing of stud clusters to investigate the serviceability limit state of the composite superstructure using data captured from the push test specimens.

40|$|To further {{enhance the}} {{application}} of fiber reinforced composites in construction, {{it will be important}} to assess the life-cycle costs of replacing conventional construction materials with advanced composites. However, the lack of sufficient reference data or maintenance records for advanced-composite applications in construction makes it difficult to make a credible assessment for life-cycle costs. The available reference data are limited to include performance information from recent applications, initial cost figures, some deterioration models, and its material properties. ^ Therefore, a practical method is required that would allow probable assessment of the life-cycle cost of advanced composite applications in construction in relation to conventional materials. The overall objective of this research was to develop a performance-based probable life-cycle cost assessment model for composite materials in construction. To achieve these objectives, the research focused on a specific application of composites in construction: FRP bridge <b>deck</b> <b>panels.</b> The model thus developed can then be used for other applications of composites in construction. ^ The life-cycle cost assessment model for FRP bridge <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> comprises of a life-cycle performance module (module- 1) and a life-cycle cost optimization module (module- 2). The objective of module- 1 is to develop an analytical model that is capable of predicting the structural deterioration over time in order to assess the deterioration rating per year (CR/year) of FRP bridge <b>deck</b> <b>panels.</b> The objective of module- 2 is to develop an analytical model that is capable of assessing the optimal life-cycle cost of FRP bridge <b>deck</b> <b>panels.</b> Three case studies were conducted to validate the logic and results of the process algorithm for the life-cycle cost assessment.

40|$|Structural {{inspection}} is {{a critical}} part of the ship structural integrity assessment. Corrosion, as a very pervasive type of structural degradation, can potentially lead to catastrophic failure or unanticipated out-of-service time. In order to mitigate the unfavorable consequences of age-related structural failure, a wisely planned inspection is needed. The current practice of calendar-based inspection of ship structures may cause either an unexpected stoppage during normal routine due to unpredicted structural failures or yield higher costs for unnecessary inspections. Therefore, a strategy to determine timely and effective inspection plans is highly desirable. Probabilistic tools have been used in ship structure analysis for years. Recently, there is revived interest in the reliability-based inspection planning of ship structures. This study is devoted to demonstrating a practical methodology and procedure that adopts a reliability-based approach in structural inspection planning of ship structures. Scheduling a gauging survey for <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> of oil tankers is used to demonstrate the proposed procedure. This approach includes the derivation of explicit limit state functions for the ultimate strength failure of <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> based on the equations stated in the International Association of Classification Societies’ Common Structure Rules for double hull oil tanker (2008), and quantifies the various types of uncertainties involved.

When actual lumber property data were used in transformed section and finite element models, the models overpredicted the stiffness of the bridge panels. The transformed section results provided the best agreement with test results. The bridges were cost effective and although some damaged occurred to the bridge modules during their removal, they have functioned well overall.

40|$|Abstract. A {{full scale}} model of {{orthotropic}} <b>deck</b> <b>panel</b> {{was designed and}} fabricated referring to the common steel box girder bridges used in China. Experiment was conducted to test the behavior and fatigue performance of the orthotropic steel bridge deck under the actual truck wheel load. The loading test {{was conducted on the}} platform specially prepared. Measurement of the over-all structure and the fatigue sensitive details was made to evaluate the performance of the panel. For each gauge position, the results are presented as the form of influence lines...|$|R
40|$|An {{alternative}} method of attaching steel metal decks onto open web bar joist or structural steel beams. Erectors require a fast, reliable, efficient fastening method {{that can be}} used independent of weather conditions, and is easy, cost effective and verifiable. Attachment of the <b>deck</b> <b>panels</b> has historically been performed using puddle welding, with self-drilling screws used only when necessary. Today, special nails, driven either by powder propellant (powder actuated tools) or by compressed air (pneumatic tools), are experiencing ever-increasing usage due to the speed, versatility and cost-effectiveness benefits derived by the installer and owner...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a m~thodology {{to assess the}} reliability of an important and representative failure mode of a ship: buckling of the <b>deck</b> <b>panels.</b> This methodology uses tools for evaluation of the limit states, modeling of loads, ge. ometry and material properties, reliability assessment and sensitivity analysis. The proposed methodology esti-mates the failure probabilities of the above failure modes, identifies the most important uncertainties and determines the most effective design modifications that result in the highest improvemtmts in reliability. The methodology is illustrated by analyzing the reliability of a cruiser...|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to refit a bridge originally designed with a concrete or non-structural deck to use an orthotropic deck, which was first utilized in Vancouver's Lions Gate Bridge. For example, San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge, completed in 1937, originally used a concrete deck. Salt carried by fog or mist reached the rebar, causing corrosion and concrete spalling. In 1985, the bridge was restored using orthotropic steel <b>deck</b> <b>panels.</b> The project not only restored the bridge to prime condition but also reduced the deck weight by 12,300 tons (11,160 metric tons).|$|R
