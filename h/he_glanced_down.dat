60|$|Hunter {{laughed as}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at his hard brown hands and dusty attire.|$|E
60|$|The Duke groaned. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> {{the table}} {{to be sure that}} Prince Terniloff was out of hearing.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at his {{unfinished}} breakfast. He had {{the air of}} one who is {{a little}} bored.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>he</b> merely <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at {{the cigar}} {{for a moment}} and then {{conveyed}} it to his lips.|$|R
60|$|Gerald {{listened with}} quick impatience. <b>He</b> kept <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> at Birkin, as if looking for {{something}} from the other man.|$|R
6000|$|But he was courtly to Carol. He {{stooped to}} examine the furnace flues; <b>he</b> straightened, <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at her, and hemmed, [...] "Got to fix your furnace, no matter what else I do." ...|$|R
60|$|David's teeth came together. There was {{lightning}} in {{his eyes}} as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> through the trees towards Vont's little cottage.|$|E
60|$|After pronouncing {{these words}} with immense assurance, <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at her, {{and at once}} fell a prey to distress, incertitude, and fear.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at his horse's quivering sides. Back {{as far as}} {{one could}} see there was that regular line of hoof marks.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> {{paused and}} <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> {{the table at}} Leblanc, and then re-opened at his former antagonist.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> rapidly <b>down</b> his beard, {{and when}} he looked up again there was for a moment an {{interested}} expression in his misty gaze. Razumov discouraged it with a cold, repellent smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very draughty," [...] he remarked, [...] "and {{you seem}} cold; {{we must not}} keep you here. May we--can I," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> the stone passage, [...] "show you to your carriage?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{laid the}} extreme {{tips of her}} fingers upon his coat sleeve. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at them for a moment. Her {{reluctance}} was evident.|$|E
60|$|Laura hesitated, puzzled. Just {{then the}} Professor came cantering {{in with a}} bundle of grass in his hand. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at the Chinaman.|$|E
60|$|Wheeler, who {{had heard}} {{something}} from Gordon, {{looked at him with}} grave sympathy, but Nasmyth made an expressive gesture as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at his attire.|$|E
500|$|When Liz learns from Kenneth that NBC {{will have}} Green Week, she says [...] "Oh brother, are they {{actually}} {{going to do something}} this year or are they just going to put that stupid green peacock {{in the corner of the}} screen?", a reference to the NBC peacock symbol having a green logo design during Green Week. As a result of what Liz said, Kenneth breaks the fourth wall, a term used when a character in a television show, film or on stage directly addresses the audience, when <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>down</b> at the logo.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is {{shelter for}} one at least, John Carter," [...] <b>he</b> said, and, <b>glancing</b> <b>down,</b> I saw {{an opening in}} the base of the tree about three feet in diameter.|$|R
5000|$|Gabriel is {{repairing}} another {{pocket watch}} at his shop when Brian Davis enters, explaining that someone called him. Gabriel {{tells him that}} he made the call. <b>He</b> <b>glances</b> <b>down</b> at the watch {{on the table and}} sees the name [...] "Sylar" [...] on the face and introduces himself to Brian Davis as [...] "Gabriel Sylar." [...] Brian stares at a mug on Gabriel's desk and manages to slide it across the desk telekinetically, then asking if Gabriel can make it go away, surprising him. Brian tells him he does not know what the ability is, but he doesn't want it. Gabriel then picks up a crystal from the table and kills Brian.|$|R
6000|$|... "The patient man {{lifted his}} head and looked at the flour-strewn walls. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at the floor, but drew back with a slight tremor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] he said, [...] "you {{certainly}} could." [...] Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at her hands. [...] "Those are unusually pretty gloves {{you have}} on." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{red edge}} of his Baedeker still {{projected}} from the lawyer's pocket, for {{it had not been}} worth their captor's while to take it. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lucy {{will sit}} still, I know," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> {{at me with}} the same serene goodness, the same repose of {{firmness}} that I have seen in him when sitting at his side amid the secure peace of his mother's hearth. Yes, thus adjured, I think I would have sat still under a rocking crag: but, indeed, to sit still in actual circumstances was my instinct; and {{at the price of}} my very life, I would not have moved to give him trouble, thwart his will, or make demands on his attention. We were in the stalls, and for a few minutes there was a most terrible, ruthless pressure about us.|$|R
60|$|Gallwey made {{a little}} gesture of {{concurrence}} as <b>he</b> once more <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> the long rows of sheaves. The stubble stood among them knee-high and above the strip of ploughing that cut it off from the prairie, for straw has no great value in that country.|$|R
50|$|Mr. 'Flint' Roberts {{came running}} along {{and he stopped}} and asked if I was all right. I wasn't hurt, as the blast had gone over my head, but I was worried at losing the lettuce and {{tomatoes}} and had lost my coat. Mr. Roberts helped me {{to my feet and}} <b>he</b> then <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> the little alleyway where one of the bombs had fallen. I wanted to have a look too, but he would not let me...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at the {{panorama}} below, with its odd jumble of hideous buildings, softened {{here and there}} with wreaths of sunstained smoke, its great blots of ugliness irredeemable, insistent.|$|E
60|$|While {{doing this}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at the bed {{on which he}} had not slept that night. The hollow in the pillow made {{by the weight of}} Haldin's head was very noticeable.|$|E
60|$|Appleby set {{his lips}} as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> {{at the white}} face, and {{felt that this was}} true. Then his eyes grew a trifle dim as he laid his hand on Tonyâ€™s arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me the {{stimulant}} that {{is needed}} to raise you from your apathy," [...] he asked. [...] "Will you find it in the rapid motion of your horse--a very noble animal--in the joy of this morning's sunshine and breeze, or in the toyland where these puppets move and walk?" [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> the promenade. [...] "Dear Lady Maggie, I beg permission to pay you a visit of ceremony. Will you receive me this afternoon?" ...|$|R
60|$|Maikar, on {{the other}} hand, went up like a squirrel. Now, the little seaman {{had been told that}} some kinds of bears can climb while others cannot. Remembering the fact, <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> anxiously <b>down,</b> as <b>he</b> went up. To his horror he saw that this bear could climb! and that his only chance would be to climb so high, that the {{branches}} which would bear his weight would not support the bear. It was a forlorn hope, but he resolved to try it.|$|R
60|$|Without being {{conscious}} {{of what he}} was doing, <b>he</b> swept his <b>glance</b> <b>down</b> the long table until it rested on Laura Waynefleet's face. She felt the blood creep into her cheeks, for she knew what he meant, but she looked at him steadily, and her eyes were shining. Then he spread his hands out.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> at {{the little}} white steamer lying in the inlet below. [...] "That's {{one of my own}} {{particular}} toys. You're coming up the coast with us next week for the salmon-trolling?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me! It never {{occurred}} to me. I suppose I seemed as odd to them as you did to me." [...] <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down.</b> [...] "And my feet. You have hoofs like a hippogriff." ...|$|E
60|$|At last John woke up also. He {{stretched}} his arms yawning, {{and for the}} first time became aware of the weight upon his breast. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> and saw dimly at first--then more clearly.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jack Hamlin had quietly {{emerged from}} his stateroom on deck and was looking over the guards. His hands were resting lightly on his hips over the {{delicate}} curves of his white waistcoat, and he was whistling softly, possibly some air {{to which he had}} made certain card-playing passengers dance the night before. He was in comfortable case, and his soft brown eyes under their long lashes were veiled with gentle tolerance of all things. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> lazily along the empty hurricane deck forward; <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> lazily <b>down</b> to the saloon deck below him. Far out against the guards below him leaned a young girl. Mr. Hamlin knitted his brows slightly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Looks {{something}} like the sea-serpent," [...] said March, drying {{his hands on the}} towel, while <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> up and <b>down</b> the list. [...] "But we sha'n't have any trouble. I've no doubt there are half a dozen things there that will do. You haven't gone up-town? Because we must be near the 'Every Other Week' office." ...|$|R
6000|$|As <b>he</b> spoke, Harris <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> {{again at}} the card on his desk. It was from the Base Commander himself, made out in Cox's heavy scrawl: Doc, this is the lad I told you about. Talk to him {{and try to find}} out how he got this delusion. He's from the new Garrison, the new check-station on Asteroid Y-3, and we don't want {{anything}} to go wrong there. Especially a silly damn thing like this! ...|$|R
