2500|$|Despite {{design and}} {{assembly}} improvements, Fordsons still required {{a high level}} of maintenance. A farmer near Atlanta in 1921 listed the cost of his Fordson repairs for the year as $1,246. He recorded problems in his diary, noting difficulty starting the engine, a broken wheel, engine failure and the rear end bursting throughout January, totaling costs of $1,301 for 620 hours of work. A Colorado farmer telephoned his dealer three times a day to complain about his Fordson. The most dangerous feature would occur when a towed implement became immoveable: the stoppage of the implement would cause a reaction through the transmission that would flip the tractor over backwards, sometimes killing the driver. This condition was introduced when the worm drive was relocated below the main <b>drive</b> <b>pinion,</b> relieving the driver from the heat it generated but also causing a torque on the tractor that lightened the load on the front wheels. One Indiana farmer believed the Fordson to be so dangerous that it should have been banned by law. The Eastern Implement Dealer claimed that Fordsons killed 36 drivers in 1918. Pipp's Weekly further claimed that Fordsons had killed 136 men up to August 1922. Ford spokesmen maintained the accidents resulted from inexperienced drivers, saying any tractor could be dangerous if improperly handled. Satisfied customers praised the Fordson, saying it made farm work easier and performed ideally in orchards and truck farms. Judging from the Fordson's market share in the late teens and early 20s, the anecdotal horror stories, while extreme, must have been relative outliers (that is, the notion that [...] "all Fordsons flip over backwards and burst at the seams" [...] was an exaggeration). Nonetheless, it became imprinted in many minds and became a punch line. The [...] "Hoyt-Clagwell" [...] tractor on the 1960s TV sitcom Green Acres was a Fordson Model F. It was known to randomly 'explode' followed by {{one or both of the}} rear wheels falling off.|$|E
50|$|The Bendix system {{places the}} starter <b>drive</b> <b>pinion</b> on a helical drive spring. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the <b>drive</b> <b>pinion</b> {{assembly}} causes it to wind the spring forcing {{the length of}} the spring to change and engage with the ring gear.

The Bendix system places the starter <b>drive</b> <b>pinion</b> on a helically cut drive shaft.

50|$|Before Chrysler's 1949 {{innovation}} of the key-operated combination ignition-starter switch, {{the starter}} was often {{operated by the}} driver pressing a button mounted on the floor or dashboard. Some vehicles had a pedal in the floor that manually engaged the starter <b>drive</b> <b>pinion</b> with the flywheel ring gear, then completed the electrical circuit to the starter motor once the pedal {{reached the end of}} its travel. Ferguson tractors from the 1940s, including the Ferguson TE20, had an extra position on the gear lever that engaged the starter switch, ensuring safety by preventing the tractors from being started in gear.|$|E
5000|$|The {{electric}} starter motor or cranking motor {{is the most}} common type used on gasoline engines and small diesel engines. The modern starter motor is either a permanent-magnet or a series-parallel wound direct current electric motor with a starter solenoid (similar to a relay) mounted on it. When DC power from the starting battery is applied to the solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch (the [...] "ignition switch"), the solenoid engages a lever that pushes out the <b>drive</b> <b>pinion</b> on the starter driveshaft and meshes the pinion with the starter ring gear on the flywheel of the engine.|$|E
50|$|During the 1960s, {{very few}} {{motorcycles}} were available with shaft final drive. BMW's {{were the most}} common. The driveshaft rode in an enclosed oil bath within the right swingarm, unlike BMW's previous models, and drove the rear wheel through an internally splined cup that meshes with a coupler crown gear keyed to the <b>drive</b> <b>pinion.</b> This meant that leaking seals could become {{a problem for the}} owners. Because the clutch was dry, there were seals {{at the rear of the}} crankshaft, at both ends of the transmission, at the rear of the driveshaft, and at the front and rear of the rear drive unit: lots of seals to develop leaks.|$|E

5000|$|The {{geometry}} of the rack system has a large impact {{on the construction of}} turnouts. If the rack is elevated above the running rails, {{there is no need to}} interrupt the running rails to allow passage of the driving pinions of the engines. Strub explicitly documented this in his U.S. patent. [...] Strub used a complex set of bell-cranks and push-rods linking the throw-rod for the points to the two throw-rods for the moving rack sections. One break in the rack was required to select between the two routes, and a second break was required where the rack rails cross the running rails. Turnouts for the Morgan Rack system were similar, with the rack elevated above the running rails. Most of the Morgan turnout patents included movable rack sections to avoid breaks in the rack, but because all Morgan locomotives had two linked <b>drive</b> <b>pinions,</b> there was no need for a continuous rack. So long as the breaks in the rack were shorter than the distance between the <b>drive</b> <b>pinions</b> on the locomotive, the rack rail could be interrupted wherever there was need to cross over a running rail.|$|R
50|$|The Yamaha WR200 {{shown above}} {{has the same}} crank & Stroke as the DT200R & ATV Blaster. The WR200 crank cases {{are similar to the}} DT200R but with a bigger reed cage port and {{slightly}} revised induction port shapes in the crank cases. The WR200 has a larger cylinder bore size of 66.8mm diameter giving a displacement of 199cm with a standard compression of 6.3:1 in standard form. The standard cylinder is nickel plated and has slightly larger porting plus two boost ports ether side of the exhaust port. This in turn makes the WR200 power valve different in shape to allow three exhaust ports to be controlled. The WR200 has a direct cable clutch <b>drive</b> <b>pinion</b> in the clutch cover, where as the DT200R & Blaster use a conventional push rod through the clutch center. The WR200 also uses a larger Mikuni TM30SS Carburetor. The WR200 Frame, Tank, seat, plastics, forks, swingarm, airbox, rear shock and electrics differ from the DT200R.|$|E
50|$|Where a steam barring {{engine was}} used, {{this was a}} small {{twin-cylinder}} engine (to avoid its own dead centre problems) with a reduction gear of high ratio, usually involving a worm gear. Final drive was by a pinion gear engaging temporarily with the teeth or barring holes cut into {{the rim of the}} main flywheel. The <b>drive</b> <b>pinion</b> was arranged on a swinging link so that it was thrown out-of-mesh automatically, once the main engine started to rotate at full speed. As the ratio was perhaps 1000:1 and the main engine ran at 60 rpm, this would otherwise have been a disastrous overspeed. Some engines instead used a final pinion on a helical spline, similar to that later used for the starters of internal combustion engines: once the main engine started, the pinion would be thrown out of engagement axially along this spline as the flywheel over-speeded the pinion relative to the shaft.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{stabilize}} the yaw bearing against rotation a means of braking is necessary. One of the simplest ways to realize that task is to apply a constant small counter-torque at the yaw drives in order to eliminate the backlash between gear-rim and yaw <b>drive</b> <b>pinions</b> and to prevent the nacelle from oscillating due to the rotor rotation. This operation however greatly reduces {{the reliability of the}} electric yaw drives, therefore the most common solution is the implementation of a hydraulically actuated disk brake.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to provide design and {{operational}} information for the conversion of small turboprop engines into land-based shaft power drives. These can provide economical solutions to individual power requirements such as standby electrical generators, {{combined heat and power}} units, fan drives or centrifugal compressor drives. Considerable numbers of ex-military engines are currently becoming available at economical prices. One such engine is the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop gas turbine which, although there are over 2000 still in civil and military service worldwide, is now being phased out of Royal Air Force operation. This paper describes the modification of a Dart RDa 12 engine to drive a centrifugal compressor from a smaller RDa 7, Mk 552, engine for a compressed air facility on a university campus. The modified engine has a power of over 2400 hp (1790 kW) at 15000 r/min and the compressor was driven directly from the engine output shaft supplying 10. 5 kg/s of air at a pressure ration of 3. 3 : 1. To achieve this, the turboprop's main reduction gearbox was removed, the teeth on the engine <b>drive</b> <b>pinion</b> ground down and a flexible coupling fitted to it to drive the RDa 7 compressor which was flange mounted on the engine gearbox-air intake casing. The removal of the main gearbox removed the drives to the lubricating oil pumps the fuel pump and the engine control system. The manner in which these problems were overcome and the method of operating the system are described. One of the most important considerations in starting such a direct drive system is the complete closing off of the air intake to the driven compressor and the design of an annular valve to perform this duty is described. The operating parameters including the flow, pressure ratio and engine turbine entry temperatures for this system are given...|$|E

50|$|Rack railway {{switches}} are {{as varied}} as rack railway technologies. Where use of the rack is optional, as on the Zentralbahn in Switzerland or the West Coast Wilderness Railway in Tasmania, {{it is common to}} place turnouts only in relatively flat areas where the rack is not needed. On systems where only the <b>pinion</b> is <b>driven</b> and the conventional rail wheels are idlers, such as the Dolderbahn in Zürich, Štrbské Pleso in Slovakia and the Schynige Platte rack railway, the rack must be continuous through the switch. The Dolderbahn switch works by bending all three rails, an operation that is performed every trip as the two trains pass in the middle. The Štrbské Pleso and Schynige Platte Strub rack system instead relies on a complex set of moving points which assemble the rack in the traversed direction and simultaneously clear the crossed direction conventional rails. In some rack systems, such as the Morgan system, where locomotives always have multiple driving pinions, it is possible to simplify turnouts by interrupting the rack rail, so long as the interruption is shorter than the spacing between the <b>drive</b> <b>pinions</b> on the locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of hypoid gear {{is that the}} ring gear of the differential and the input pinion gear are both hypoid. In most passenger cars this allows the pinion to be offset {{to the bottom of}} the crown wheel. This provides for longer tooth contact and allows the shaft that <b>drives</b> the <b>pinion</b> to be lowered, reducing the [...] "hump" [...] intrusion in the passenger compartment floor. However, the greater the displacement of the input shaft axis from the crown wheel axis, the lower the mechanical efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Face gear {{dynamics}} {{is addressed}} by many scholars. However, dynamic behaviors of face gear <b>drives</b> associated with <b>pinion</b> dedendum fatigue cracks {{are yet to}} be investigated. Thus, in the study, a calculation solution of static transmission errors (STE) of face gear <b>drives</b> associated with <b>pinion</b> dedendum fatigue cracks is constructed, based on the proposed equivalent face gear drives, and a four-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model of face gear drives is formulated. The dynamic behaviors of an example case of face gear <b>drives</b> associated with <b>pinion</b> dedendum fatigue cracks are investigated. The simulation results indicate natural frequencies of face gear drives would be decreased with pinion dedendum fatigue crack extensions; the relationship between accelerations and velocities of face gear drives, dynamic mesh forces, and vibration accelerations at bearings would also be changed. However, pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face gear drives are detected difficultly, due to simulation result similarities. Therefore, a determination solution for pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face gear drives is proposed. The result shows a trend of vibration accelerations at bearings, namely, a first decreasing and then increasing tendency, which could be beneficial to detecting pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face gear drives. These contributions would improve engineering applications of face gear drives in the future...|$|R
