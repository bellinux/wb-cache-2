2500|$|Beginning in 1892, the {{industry}} was revolutionized when the large hat factories began to shift to manufacturing unfinished <b>hat</b> <b>bodies</b> only, and supplying them to smaller hat shops for finishing. So while Danbury produced 24% of America's hats in 1904, the city supplied {{the industry}} with 75% of its <b>hat</b> <b>bodies.</b> [...] The {{turn of the century}} was the heyday of the hatting industry in Danbury, when it became known as the [...] "Hat City" [...] and the [...] "Hatting Capitol of the World". Its motto was [...] "Danbury Crowns Them All". But by the 1920s, the hat industry was in decline. By 1923, only six manufacturers were left in Danbury, which increased the pressure on workers. After WWII, returning GI's went hatless, a trend that accelerated through the 1950s, dooming the city's hat industry. The city's last major hat factory, owned by Stetson, closed in 1964. The last hat was made in Danbury in 1987 when a small factory owned by Stetson closed.|$|R

If you grow too eager for your twopence, the acquisition or the loss of it may affect your peace of mind, and peace of mind is better than any amount of twopences. My friend, the old-clothes'-man, whose agonies over the hat have led to this rambling disquisition, has, I very much fear, by a too eager pursuit of small profits, disturbed the equanimity of a mind that ought to be easy and happy. [...] "Had I stood out," [...] he thinks, [...] "I might have had the hat for threepence," [...] and he doubts whether, having given fourpence for it, he will ever get back his money.

Before and since Mr. Franklin wrote his pretty apologue of the Whistle have we not all made bargains of which we repented, and coveted and acquired objects for which we have paid too dearly! Who has not purchased his hat in some market or other? There is General M'Clellan's cocked hat for example: I dare say he was eager enough to wear it, and he has learned that it is by no means cheerful wear. There were the military beavers of Messeigneurs of Orleans:* they wore them gallantly in the face of battle; but I suspect they were glad enough to pitch them into the James River and come home in mufti. Ah, mes amis! A chacun son schakot! I was looking at a bishop the other day, and thinking, [...] "My right reverend lord, that broad-brim and rosette must bind your great broad forehead very tightly, and give you many a headache. A good easy wideawake were better for you, and I would like to see that honest face with a cutty-pipe in the middle of it." [...] There is my Lord Mayor. My once dear lord, my kind friend, when your two years' reign was over, did not you jump for joy and fling your chapeau-bras out of window: and hasn't that hat cost you a pretty bit of money? There, in a splendid travelling chariot, in the sweetest bonnet, all trimmed with orange-blossoms and Chantilly lace, sits my Lady Rosa, with old Lord Snowden by her side.

40|$|Stevie Smith's work {{not only}} prefigures a key debate in {{contemporary}} feminism between essentialists and social constructionists, {{but also the}} more current debates that have developed as the constructionist position continues to be explored. She takes an anti-essentialist position as her inaugural point and explores the limits of agency in redefining gender identities against established cultural signification. Novel on Yellow Paper is best understood {{in the context of}} autobiographical fiction, a genre which maintains that identities are always to some extent fictional and, therefore, subject to self-invention. Smith challenges the notion of a fixed, female essence by utilizing a strategy of multivocality. Pompey, the protagonist, adopts a variety of voices which situate her as a product of literary and social discourses and prevent her cooption into a stable subject suitable for matrimony. In Over the Frontier, however, self-construction seems less ideal. It carries the potential for self-destruction. Smith reveals the failure of androgyny as a solution to the woes of femininity and shows that a woman impersonating a man exposes the category "man" as a subject-position inhabitable by either sex. Smith's hat poems serve as clear examples of the risks and possibilities involved in refashioning gender. Hats serve as vestimentary signs that either reify or reformulate traditional gender identities. Beneath Smith's <b>hats</b> are <b>bodies,</b> not The Body, capitalized, abstracted, and theorized solely as a text inscribed by history and culture, but particular bodies which, in their differences, bear the marks of socialization. In her poetry, she most often tropes female bodies as prisons; in order to escape essentialist definitions associated with those bodies, she revises fairy tales to imagine physical transformations that transport women into other bodies and alternative sexualities. Similarly, the drawings that accompany her poems subvert poetic statements which appear to endorse "proper" feminine concerns and traditional, masculine literary values...|$|R
40|$|Male Fischer 344 rats {{were either}} fed ad libitum (Group A) or 60 % {{of the ad}} libitum intake (Group R) {{starting}} at 6 weeks of age; {{the latter is a}} life prolonging food restriction. Total adipose mass increased with increasing age in both Group A and Group R rats until about 70 % of the life span after which it declined. The results indicate that the lower adipose mass of the Group R rats is probably not related to life prolongation. Adipocyte hypertrophy is involved in growth of the epididymal and perirenal depots in adult Group R rats and is the sole basis of epididymal depot growth in adult Group A rats. In-creasing adipocyte number is the sole basis of perirenal depot growth in adult Group A rats and is involved in the growth of both depots in adult Group R rats. Decreasing adipose mass during senescence involves decreasing mean adipocyte volume but not a decrease in the adipocyte number. Key Words: Food restriction, Longevity, Age and fat mass, Age and adipose tissue cellularity. T <b>HAT</b> human <b>body</b> fat content increaseswith advancing age is an often stated generalization (Masoro, 1976). Indeed, there is strong evidence that in the human popula-tions of developed nations adipose tissue mass does make up an ever increasing fraction of the total body mass of adults as their age increases until 55 years of age (Brozek, 1952; Malina, 1969). However, for ages greater than 55 years, the evidence is conflicting as to whether adipose mass continues to increase (Novak, 1972), remains unchanged (Parizkova & Eiselt, 1971) or decreases (Myhre & Kessler, 1966). Al-through it is said that adipose mass also in-creases with age in laboratory rats (Berg, 1960) few data on the changes in the mass of adipose tissue that occur throughout the life span of the rat have been published (Lesser et al., 1973; Stiles et al., 1975). This is surprising since rats are currently being heavily utilized as...|$|R
60|$|About five o'clock, I had {{occasion}} {{to go to the}} Rue de Rivoli, and I found the streets and the garden with much fewer people in them than was usual at that hour. There I heard a rumour that a slight disturbance had taken place on the Boulevard des Italiens, in consequence of a refusal of the Duc de Fitzjames, a leading Carlist, to take off his <b>hat</b> to the <b>body</b> of Lamarque, as he stood at a balcony. I had often met M. de Fitzjames in society, and, although a decided friend of the old regime, I knew his tone of feeling and manners to be too good, to credit a tale so idle. By a singular coincidence, the only time I had met with General Lamarque in private was at a little dinner given by Madame de M----, at which Monsieur de Fitzjames was also a guest. We were but five or six at table, and nothing could be more amicable, or in better taste, than the spirit of conciliation and moderation that prevailed between men so widely separated by opinion. This was not long before Gen. Lamarque was attacked by his final disease, and as there appeared to me to be improbability in the rumour of the affair of the Boulevards, I quite rightly set it down as one of the exaggerations that daily besiege our ears. It being near six, I consequently returned home to dinner, supposing that the day would end as so many had ended before.|$|R
40|$|Swine may be anesthetized {{in order}} to {{complete}} routine `production procedures or surgical operations. Swine are difficult to restrain, effectively anesthetize, and their response and reaction to anesthesia can vary substantially. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if Y is an effective anesthetic reversal agent in mature sows. Twelve, clinically normal, mixed-parity, crossbred sows were purchased from a commercial producer in Iowa and housed in individual pens at Iowa State University. Anesthesia was induced with xylazine, ketamine and telazol injected intramuscularly. Following a twenty minute stabilization period, sows’ palpebral reflex was evaluated, and if absent were injected with sterile saline (S; n= 12) or yohimbine HCl (Y; n= 12) at 0. 1 mg/kg. Sensibility trait scores (palpebral reflex, jaw tone, nose prick, alertness to human approach test (<b>HAT),</b> and sow <b>body</b> position) were collected every 10 -mins until each sows attained sensibility. Data were analyzed using the PROC MIXED procedure in SAS®. A P value of ≤ 0. 05 was considered to be significant. There were no (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) differences between the times saline and yohimbine treatments were administered (average 24 min post anesthesia administration). Yohimbine treated sows recovered 172 minutes earlier (P = 0. 002) than S treated sows. Return to sensibility (score 0) for all measures were quicker (P 3 ̆c 0. 003) for Y treated sows compared to S treated sows. In conclusion, yohimbine is an effective reversal agent in sows anesthetized with xylazine, ketamine and telazol. This agent may be a tool used by veterinarians and researchers to ensure that sows have a quicker recovery from anesthesia with minimal complications...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} of glider pilot’s flying quality influencing personal stressors Aim of the study:To estimate the personal stressors influence to the flying quality of glider pilot’s. Methods:The instantaneous analytic research using questionnaires was {{made during the}} European gliding championship. Two types of questionnaires were created in English and given for the participants (n = 90) to fill every day, 90 before the flight and 90 after. All together 1. 260 questionnaires were given and 742 were returned (58. 9 %). Statistical analysis was made with „Statistica for Windows“ and Microsoft Excel programs. Results:Subjective pilots fatigue average increased 18. 57 % during the flight (stdev. 25. 02 %). At first fatigue increased, later decreased {{and at the end}} of the championship increased. Fatigue were increased by personal stressors, like the rest (r = 0. 19, p< 0. 05), sleep duration (r = 0. 15, p< 0. 05), coffee usage (r = 0. 17, p< 0. 05). Fatigue decreased with tea usage (r = - 0. 19, p< 0. 05), short time of awake (r = - 0. 18, p< 0. 05). Most glider pilot’s noted that various health changes didn’t influence flying, but sweating importuned little. That was approved by objective measurements. Final results were determined by every day points (r = 0. 57, p< 0. 05), pilot’s experience (r = 0. 29, p< 0. 05), total flight time (r = 0. 25, p< 0. 05), flight’s distance (r = 0. 25, p< 0. 05), tea usage (r = 0. 16, p< 0. 05), rest (r = 0. 14, p< 0. 05). Negative influence to the results were made by sweating (r = - 0. 21, p< 0. 05), long time of awake (r = - 0. 15, p< 0. 05), hunger (r = - 0. 11, p< 0. 05). Conclusions:Subjective glider pilot’s fatigue increased during flight and varied during championship – increased at first days, then decreased and increased again at the last days because of various stressors and adaptation process. Personal factors, like age, coffee usage, sleep quality and duration increased fatigue. Tea usage, time of awake and experience decreased fatigue. Pilots felt thirst, will to urinate often and they influenced flight quality. The last competition results were determined by flight results – every day points, tea usage and rest. Negative influence was made by time of awake and hunger. Practical recommendations:To have active rest, good sleep, drink tea, do not smoke when planning to flight. Use light colour clothes and <b>hats</b> to avoid <b>body</b> and head heat and sweating, use shade to protect eyes. Drink enough liquid and eat. Unskilful pilots should glide carefuly and do not trust their power very much. Senior pilots should check their health regularly...|$|R
