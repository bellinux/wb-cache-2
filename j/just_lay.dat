25|$|Myiasis is the {{infestation}} {{of living}} or necrotic tissue {{in a living}} host by fly larvae. Some flies may <b>just</b> <b>lay</b> their eggs in a festering wound, while other may infest unwounded tissue. C. cadaverina has occasionally been found in cases of myiasis but is not a fly that is regularly found. Myiasis is fairly uncommon in the United States, but tends to be very common {{in third world countries}} and can create a major problem with livestock, causing severe economic losses. Myiasis is different from maggot therapy in which physicians purposely use larvae of flies that feed on necrotic tissue in order to clean up a wound and aid healing. Maggot therapy can clean up a wound that has been festering for months very quickly.|$|E
25|$|Exodus says {{each day}} one omer of manna was {{gathered}} per family member (about 3.64 litres), and may imply this was {{regardless of how}} much effort was put into gathering it; a midrash attributed to Rabbi Tanhuma remarks that although some were diligent enough {{to go into the}} fields to gather manna, others <b>just</b> <b>lay</b> down lazily and caught it with their outstretched hands. The Talmud states that this factor was used to solve disputes about the ownership of slaves, since the number of omers of manna each household could gather would indicate how many people were legitimately part of the household; the omers of manna for stolen slaves could be gathered only by legitimate owners, and therefore legitimate owners would have spare omers of manna.|$|E
500|$|Astonishing Stories is not {{remembered as}} {{being among the}} best science fiction magazines: both critic Peter Nicholls and sf writer Jack Williamson have {{described}} it as a [...] "training ground" [...] for writers who would go on to do their best work elsewhere. [...] However, Nicholls adds that [...] "its stories were surprisingly good considering how little was paid for them", and Wolf and Thompson agree, claiming that [...] "there was much that was memorable in Astonishing, both by way of immediate appeal and of more lasting quality". [...] Pohl himself, who later became a very successful magazine editor, felt he made many mistakes. [...] He quotes as an example his serialization of Malcolm Jameson's story [...] "Quicksands of Youthwardness" [...] in three parts; the story was only 27,000 words long, and readers complained (justifiably, in Pohl's view) that serializing it in a bimonthly magazine meant they had to wait for five months to read the whole story, in relatively small 9,000-word pieces. [...] Overall, Pohl assessed his performance by saying [...] "I wasn't really a very good editor"; adding [...] "With what I know now I could have made those magazines sing, but as it was they <b>just</b> <b>lay</b> there".|$|E

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said that}} this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't as fun and funny as it could have been", explaining that it had some great laughs, but that as a whole it [...] "felt a bit flat and joyless." [...] He wrote that the cameos by Jon Hamm, Jason Sudeikis, and Dean Winters [...] "did little {{in the body of}} the episode", nonetheless, the [...] "real payoff" [...] came in the end when the three portrayed the dental assistants. [...] "It was a gag mostly unrelated to the rest of the episode, and it was the best part of the half hour." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave it a 7.7 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that the episode was a [...] "pretty lifeless outing", reasoning it had the [...] "usual laughs in the margin" [...] but overall [...] "there were a lot of long, flat, deadly stretches, and entire subplots like Jenna with her stalker that <b>just</b> <b>lay</b> there." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed Liz's story here, but noted that he disliked Jenna's stalker story, concluding [...] "...there were a few really funny lines... but overall I found her missing-her-stalker-on-Valentine's-Day plot to be rather... icky [...] Honestly, I want to see more of the human, normal side of Jenna". Nick Catucci of New York magazine felt that Liz's plot here was [...] "one of the worst story lines in recent memory".|$|E
2500|$|The November 1988 {{edition of}} Top magazine, run by Tower Records, {{included}} a review by Simon Young who thought Enya had produced [...] "a fine, peaceful New Age album, which works best when her voice-from-heaven is matched with subtle electronic pools {{of sound and}} layer upon layer of breathy, Clannadesque backing vocals". Jonathan Takiff, for the Philadelphia Daily News, started his review with: [...] "When this old world starts getting you down, <b>just</b> <b>lay</b> on ... Watermark ... and drift away to a blissful state", of which Enya brings a [...] "fusion of old sod balladry and modem technology to another plateau, with a magical, mysterious brew that could be dubbed [...] "New Age Irish" [...] or [...] "Celtic Ambient"". Takiff picked [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] as the stand out song, and called [...] "River" [...] a [...] "blissful intrumental". He concluded with: [...] "There's nothing uptempo to ever jar the hypnotic ebb and flow. <b>Just</b> <b>lay</b> back and let this music roll all over you." [...] In a review printed in The Boston Globe, Steve Morse wrote about the album highly. He called the record a [...] "series of lush dreamscapes that team the vocal beauty of Irish traditional song with multitracked synthesizer tones", and compared it to works from fellow ambient and new age artists Jean-Michel Jarre, Vangelis and Brian Eno. Its sound, he thought, is [...] "beautiful" [...] and noticed a recurrence of the imagery of water throughout. Morse concluded, [...] "This is an album of atmospheres – true mood music for the soul".|$|E
2500|$|After Goforth {{had given}} his sermon, {{he said to the}} people: [...] "Please let's not have any of your {{ordinary}} kind of praying. If there are any prayers which you've got off by heart and which you've used for years, <b>just</b> <b>lay</b> them aside. We haven't any time for them. But if the Spirit of God so moves you that you feel you simply must give utterance to what is in your heart, then do not hesitate. We have time for that kind of praying. Now, the meeting is open for prayer." [...] Spontaneous prayers come forth from several individuals at every meeting, followed by more confessions of sin and wrongdoing among church leaders.|$|E
