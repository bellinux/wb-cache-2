5000|$|The bridge {{consists}} of two parallel arches with a free span of 45 m and an <b>intermediate</b> <b>deck.</b> The arches rise {{to a total of}} 6 m with a span-rise ratio of 7:5, and attach to the deck with two connected longitudinal beams. The arches have a triangular cross-section, with a central web. Their depth is [...]7 m, constant through their length; the width of each section varies between [...]7 and 1 meter. The longitudinal beams are rectangular hollow sections 1 x [...]5 meters and plates with varying thicknesses between 15 mm and 25 mm. In the central zone (with the arch above the deck) the beams have a central web connected to the web of the arch, allowing transfer of the vertical load of the longitudinal beam to the arch. Two struts (connecting the base of each of the arches {{and the end of the}} longitudinal beam) avoid horizontal reaction on the abutments.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND The divider barrier {{consists}} of the operating deck and associated seals, personnel access doors, and equipment hatches that separate {{the upper and lower}} containment compartments. Divider barrier integrity is necessary to minimize bypassing of the ice condenser by the hot steam and air mixture released into the lower compartment during a Design Basis Accident (DBA). This ensures that most of the gases pass through the ice bed, which condenses the steam and limits pressure and temperature during the accident transient. Limiting the pressure and temperature reduces the release of fission product radioactivity from containment to the environment {{in the event of a}} DBA. In the event of a DBA, the ice condenser inlet doors (located below the operating deck) open due to the pressure rise in the lower compartment. This allows air and steam to flow from the lower compartment into the ice condenser. The resulting pressure increase within the ice condenser causes the <b>intermediate</b> <b>deck</b> doors and the door panels at the top of th...|$|E

The footbridge is located near Frýdek-Místek. The length of the span is 17, 5 meters, the width is 2, 1 meters. The construction of the footbridge is solved as a space framework with <b>intermediate</b> bridge <b>deck.</b> The calculation is done using program Scia Engineer 14 and then revised manually.

500|$|The {{design of}} the bridge differs {{slightly}} from other bridges, which are of live load composite construction. The difference is in the dead load design concept adopted for this bridge and concreting of the side spans done with support provided by the <b>intermediate</b> trestle. The <b>deck</b> is designed with a grid structure of girders. One set of girders are {{at the end and}} another set in the middle, which are braced by girders spaced on an average at [...] centre to centre.|$|R

Span of the footbridge is 30 m, and the width is 4 m. The footbridge {{is covered with a}} saddle roof. The main supporting elements are two triple joint arcs with <b>intermediate</b> bridge <b>deck.</b> The bridge deck is made of two main beams and nine cross members, with always two longitudinal members in between them.

40|$|Dissertação de Mestrado em Construção Metálica e Mista apresentada à Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade de CoimbraOne of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects {{in the design of the}} offshore platforms is related to natural hazards and catastrophic events such as wind storm, wave, earthquake, explosion and fire. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling, which enables to examine complex structures affected by selected fire scenarios, has become one {{of the most}} common tools in the fire engineering, also in case of offshore platforms. Fires on offshore platforms are large, in the open air, hydrocarbon usually with a very rapid heat release. Unfortunately, this type of field models results in problems with their validation since there is a huge gap in analytical methods that could be used for this purpose. For the fire risk assessment, numerous experiments were performed in order to introduce analytical methods. However, these analytical approaches are valid only for particular conditions. The limitations are associated with the experimental environment on which they are based. Regarding the analytical models, EN 1991 - 1 - 2 presents a simplified calculation model developed by Heskestad to assess localised fires in case of fire in open air. However, this method shows some limitations: only the temperature in the plume is calculated and, if the wind effect is considered, the method is no longer applicable. Moreover, it is questionable to use Heskestad approach for large pool fires, since the experiments on which the method is based were conducted for smaller scale fires. There are also some analytical models for determining the radiative heat flux: Shokri and Beyler model, Mudan and Croce model and Modified Solid Flame model. However, they also show some limitations, especially due to the shape of the fire area by assuming that the fire flame is cylindrical. Due to the complex conditions, validation and accuracy of offshore fires and their field models is still uncertain. In this thesis, a numerical simulation of a full-scale hydrocarbon pool fire is performed in FDS software. The study case corresponds to a “fictitious” fixed offshore platform which dimensions are based on the typical offshore platform. It is defined as an open structure composed by three main <b>decks</b> and two <b>intermediate</b> <b>decks,</b> steel frames, compartments and helideck. Fire scenarios assume an accidental crude oil leakage, which spreads and results in a localised pool fire. Modelled scenarios vary due to the localisation of the fire, its size, the total heat release rate and wind conditions. The results from the FDS model are compared with the available analytical methods. It is observed that smaller grid sizes in FDS models give better prediction of the temperature in the plume along its symmetrical vertical axis if compared to the temperatures assessed by the expression given in EN 1991 - 1 - 2 for localised fires. The outcomes for the radiative heat fluxes from FDS models are within the values predicted by the analytical models. However, the deviation in the results from all considered methods was observed which arises from different assumptions that the analytical correlation are based on as well as the input parameters used for the numerical modelling...|$|R
