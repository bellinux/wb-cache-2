5|$|I do not, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> your Lordships do not, {{have any}} wish {{to expand the}} role of the {{judiciary}} at the expense of any other organ of the State or to seek to frustrate the properly expressed wish of Parliament as contained in legislation. The attribution in certain quarters of such a wish to the judiciary is misconceived and appears to be the product of lack of understanding of the judicial function and the sources of law which the courts are bound to apply.|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt.</b>|$|E
25|$|This case tho' {{depending}} upon a practice not common {{in this country}} {{is by no means a}} difficult one. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> but that the error complained of might have been corrected by the same court upon motion, at a subsequent term; but I should not for that reason reverse the judgment, since the party having preferred a writ of error coram vobis had a right to proceed in that way, tho' a shorter, and much less expensive mode might have been pursued.|$|E

25|$|If Campese wanted to, I am sure {{he could}} have sprinted for the corner and scored the try. Instead, he ran {{straight}} at Ackerman. The Welshman obviously knew enough about Campese to realise it was useless to try and tackle him front-on. Instead, he did what I suggested earlier that any defender should do against Campese – he ran with him. It was then that Campese began to zigzag, forcing Ackerman to zigzag, too, looking over one shoulder after another to see which way Campese was heading. I was following about 20 metres behind and could not believe what was happening. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that Campese turned it on to make a personal point with Ackerman. When the defence eventually closed in on him, Campese flicked a pass {{over his shoulder to}} Michael Hawker, who scored the try.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} of 'fair and reasonable' {{must therefore be}} something else, and I cannot think of any other standard appropriate than the normal needs of an average employee, regarded {{as a human being}} in a civilised community. If, instead of individual bargaining, one can conceive of a collective agreement - an agreement between all the employers in a given trade on the one side, and all the employees on the other - {{it seems to me that}} the framers of the agreement would have to take as the first and dominant factor the cost of living as a civilised being. If A lets B have the use of his horses on the terms that he gives them fair and reasonable treatment, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that it is B's duty to give them proper food and water, and such shelter and rest as they need; and, as wages are the means of obtaining commodities, surely the State in stipulating for fair and reasonable remuneration for the employees means that the wages shall be sufficient to provide these things, and clothing and a condition of frugal comfort estimated by current human standards.|$|E

According to Coughley, the USAF had full knowledge of the locations of Pakistani border posts, and thus there was no excuse for this incident.|$|E
500|$|Many {{survivors}} of the tragedy refused to blame anyone. Survivor John Jacques wrote, [...] "I blame nobody. I am not anxious to blame anybody... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that those who {{had to do with}} its management meant well and tried to do the best they could under the circumstances." [...] Another survivor, Francis Webster, was quoted as having said, [...] "Was I sorry that I chose to come by hand cart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Hand Cart Company." [...] On the other hand, survivor John Chislett, who later left the Church, wrote bitterly of Richards promising them that [...] "we should get to Zion in safety." ...|$|E

On 13 August, he scored his first {{goal of the}} season in a 5–1 win over Dundee United. He also picked up an ankle injury which ruled him out for the next two matches. On 25 August he made his return in Celtic's 3–1 loss to FC Sion. Three days later, he scored both goals in a 2–0 win over St Mirren. English Premier League clubs Queens Park Rangers and Wolverhampton Wanderers {{expressed}} interest in signing Hooper on transfer deadline day of summer 2011, however Celtic rejected their enquiries about his availability. Hooper's regular strike partner Anthony Stokes said [...] "He's a top, top player. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> one day he could play at the very top level but we want to keep him here as long as possible." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2009 it was {{announced}} that Smith was hoping to release her second album later in the year. In an interview, she expressed surprise and pleasure that the label wanted her to do another album so soon after the first. In September, further details about the album were released, including its name, Wonderland, and planned release date, 30 November. Smith claimed that Faryl [...] "was an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording", while Cohen, producer of both Faryl and Wonderland, said Smith had [...] "matured as an artist since the first album and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that once again, people will be astonished and moved by her performances". The album, which was recorded at Sarm Studios in Notting Hill, London, was completed in early October, and is loosely based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Wonderland was released on 30 November. To publicise the album, Smith appeared on numerous radio shows, as well as television appearances including Ready Steady Cook, Blue Peter, the BBC News Channel, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and Sky News Sunrise.|$|E
500|$|In {{support of}} the album the band headlined shows at Marlay Park, The Galway Arts Festival, Sea Sessions & The Cork Marquee in {{addition}} to touring Europe and North America extensively. [...] On 17 December 2012 they organised a special midnight concert at The Olympia Theatre in Dublin to benefit the [...] and their work to help the disadvantaged and increasing numbers of [...] "new poor" [...] resulting from the economic crash. Brother Kevin Crowley of the Centre was quoted in Hot Press [...] "Our numbers get bigger and bigger, we have 200 people {{in the morning and}} nearly 500 in the evening for dinner. [...] So the whole charity concert was a tremendous success, a huge boost. [...] When Bell X1 came to present the cheque I was so impressed by their kindness and sensitivity. [...] I would hope and pray, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> that they will be a huge success for years to come." [...] Hot Press reported that the show raised €20,285 and the day Centre received a further €225,000 due to the awareness raised.|$|E
500|$|Previous {{same-sex}} storylines in {{the show}} had led to criticism from conservative groups. Bower has said that she expects this storyline to come under fire, saying [...] "I do believe homophobia is still alive and well, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> {{that we will get}} complaints about it". Australian LGBT website SameSame said the story had attracted attention from some media commentators, who called it [...] "an obvious ratings grab and an attempt to out-gay rival soap, Home and Away". However, script producer, Emma Steele defended the storyline and said {{that it is not a}} [...] "ploy to grab ratings". Steele said that she is [...] "particularly proud" [...] of the way Chris's storyline had been handled and she added [...] "It was something we wanted to do for a while because it's a story that affects so many people and in so many different ways. It wasn't just Chris's story. I think it's interesting to see how [...] affected his friends and his relationships with them too".|$|E
60|$|I did {{not like}} her protesting so much as this; but I {{saw that it was}} a {{condition}} of her being able to deal with herself in the matter, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> she was telling the truth.|$|R
60|$|I protested. I said I {{was going}} to take a {{vacation}} anyway, and business was not pressing just then. I also hinted that, while <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> of her capacity, she might have found the duties of superintendent rather arduous.|$|R

500|$|Posted to RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, Jones was put {{in charge}} of the Motor Transport Repair Section and made acting (later permanent) Officer Commanding Workshops. He was highly {{regarded}} for his technical and administrative ability but rated only [...] "average" [...] in command and dealing with personnel. In 1926 he took up flight instruction and within a year had been graded a 1A Flying Instructor. He was promoted to squadron leader on 31 March 1927 and given command of Flying Squadron at No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS). Jones spent two years in Britain from 1928, attending the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and graduating top of his class at the RAF's Central Flying School. He later recalled of this posting, [...] "The social life was new to me, as was the etiquette... I learned as fast as I could, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that I unwittingly committed many a social blunder." [...] As the RAAF's senior officer in the UK, Jones had expected to be invited to accompany the airship R101 on its maiden flight to India. Instead another Australian officer was nominated to make the trip, and Jones avoided the disaster which followed.|$|E
500|$|Oliphant then {{met with}} the Uranium Committee. Samuel K. Allison, a new member of the Committee, was a talented {{experimental}} physicist and a protégé of Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago. Oliphant [...] "came to a meeting", Allison recalls, [...] "and said 'bomb' in no uncertain terms. He told us we must concentrate every effort on the bomb, and said we {{had no right to}} work on power plants or anything but the bomb. The bomb would cost 25 million dollars, he said, and Britain did not have the money or the manpower, so it was up to us." [...] Allison was surprised that Briggs had kept the committee in the dark. Oliphant visited his friend Ernest Lawrence, and also spoke with James Conant and Enrico Fermi. He not only managed to convince the Americans that an atomic bomb was feasible, but also inspired Lawrence to convert his [...] cyclotron into a giant mass spectrometer for isotope separation, a technique Oliphant had pioneered in 1934. Leo Szilard later wrote, [...] "if Congress knew the true history of the atomic energy project, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> but that it would create a special medal to be given to meddling foreigners for distinguished services, and that Dr Oliphant {{would be the first to}} receive one." ...|$|E
500|$|Confronted by a Puritan {{friend with}} rumours about his [...] "ungodly life", Dudley defended himself in 1576: I {{stand on the}} top of the hill, where ... the {{smallest}} slip seemeth a fall ... I may fall many ways and have more witnesses thereof than many others who perhaps be no saints neither ... for my faults ... they lie before Him who <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> but will cancel them as I have been and shall be most heartily sorry for them. With Douglas Sheffield, a young widow of the Howard family, he had a serious relationship from about 1569. He explained to her that he could not marry, not even in order to beget a Dudley heir, without his [...] "utter overthrow": You must think it is some marvellous cause ... that forceth me thus to be cause almost of the ruin of mine own house ... my brother you see long married and not like to have children, it resteth so now in myself; and yet such occasions is there ... as if I should marry I am sure never to have [...] favour". Although in this letter Leicester said he still loved her as he did at the beginning, he offered her his help to find another husband for reasons of respectability if she so wished. The affair continued and in 1574 [...] Douglas gave birth to a son, also called Robert Dudley.|$|E
60|$|I made my {{way there}} and took up the {{receiver}} without any special interest. Ralph was fidgety these days, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that he <b>had</b> {{something to say to}} me about the shooting. His first words, however, riveted my attention.|$|R
60|$|Springing up the ladder, I {{hastened to}} the cabin, pondering as I went the strange {{testimony}} borne by these {{men to the}} effect of the Gospel on savage natures--testimony which, as it was perfectly disinterested, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> whatever was strictly true.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{an immense}} number of words," [...] said Cecilia after a pause, [...] "to {{say you want}} to fall in love! <b>I</b> <b>'ve</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> you <b>have</b> as good a genius for that as any one, if you would only trust it." ...|$|R
