5|$|Linezolid's {{spectrum}} of activity against Gram-positive bacteria {{is similar to that}} of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin, which has long been the standard for treatment of MRSA infections, and the two drugs are often compared. Other comparable antibiotics include teicoplanin (trade name Targocid, a glycopeptide like vancomycin), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid, a combination of two streptogramins, not active against E. faecalis), and <b>daptomycin</b> (Cubicin, a lipopeptide), and some agents still being developed, such as ceftobiprole, dalbavancin, and telavancin. Linezolid is the only one that can be taken by mouth. In the future, oritavancin and iclaprim may be useful oral alternatives to linezolidâ€”both are in the early stages of clinical development.|$|E
25|$|Medications, {{substance}} abuse, {{and environmental}} exposures may all trigger eosinophil dysfunction. Medications such as NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen), nitrofurantoin, phenytoin, L-tryptophan, <b>daptomycin</b> and ampicillin and drugs of abuse such as inhaled heroin and cocaine may trigger an allergic response {{which results in}} EP. Chemicals such as sulfites, aluminum silicate, and cigarette smoke can cause EP when inhaled. A New York City firefighter developed EP after inhalation of dust from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.|$|E
2500|$|The serendipitous {{discovery}} and subsequent clinical success of penicillin prompted a large-scale search for other environmental microorganisms that might produce anti-infective natural products. [...] Soil and water {{samples were collected}} {{from all over the}} world, leading to the discovery of streptomycin (derived from Streptomyces griseus), and the realization that bacteria, not just fungi, represent an important source of pharmacologically active natural products. [...] This, in turn, {{led to the development of}} an impressive arsenal of antibacterial and antifungal agents including amphotericin B, chloramphenicol, <b>daptomycin</b> and tetracycline (from Streptomyces spp.), the polymyxins (from Paenibacillus polymyxa), and the rifamycins (from Amycolatopsis rifamycinica).|$|E
2500|$|Evolution of {{microbial}} {{resistance to}} vancomycin {{is a growing}} problem, in particular, within healthcare facilities such as hospitals. While newer alternatives to vancomycin exist, such as linezolid (2000) and <b>daptomycin</b> (2003), {{the widespread use of}} vancomycin makes resistance to the drug a significant worry, especially for individual patients if resistant infections are not quickly identified and the patient continues the ineffective treatment. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [...] emerged in 1987. Vancomycin resistance evolved in more common pathogenic organisms during the 1990s and 2000s, including vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA). Agricultural use of avoparcin, another similar glycopeptide antibiotic, {{may have contributed to the}} evolution of vancomycin-resistant organisms.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Daptomycin</b> {{has been}} shown to be non-inferior to {{standard}} therapies (nafcillin, oxacillin, flucloxacillin or vancomycin) in the treatment of bacteraemia and right-sided endocarditis caused by S. aureus. [...] A study in Detroit, Michigan compared 53 patients treated for suspected MRSA skin or soft tissue infection with <b>daptomycin</b> against vancomycin, showing faster recovery (4 versus 7 days) with <b>daptomycin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Also, {{myopathy}} and rhabdomyolysis {{have been}} reported in patients simultaneously taking statins, but whether this is due entirely to the statin or whether <b>daptomycin</b> potentiates this effect is unknown. Due to the limited data available, the manufacturer recommends that statins be temporarily discontinued while the patient is receiving <b>daptomycin</b> therapy. Creatine kinase levels are usually checked regularly while individuals undergo <b>daptomycin</b> therapy.|$|E
50|$|In phase III {{clinical}} trials, limited {{data showed}} <b>daptomycin</b> {{to be associated}} with poor outcomes in patients with left-sided endocarditis. <b>Daptomycin</b> has not been studied in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis or meningitis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Daptomycin</b> {{resistance}} is still uncommon, {{but has been}} increasingly reported in GRE, starting in Korea in 2005, in Europe in 2010, in Taiwan 2011, and in the USA, where nine cases have been reported from 2007 to 2011. <b>Daptomycin</b> resistance emerged {{in five of the}} six cases while they were treated. The mechanism of {{resistance is}} unknown. A 4 million year-old strain of Paenibacillus isolated from soil samples in Lechuguilla Cave was found to be naturally resistant to <b>daptomycin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Also {{bactericidal}} are <b>daptomycin,</b> fluoroquinolones, metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, co-trimoxazole, telithromycin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Daptomycin</b> is {{applicable}} as 30-min infusion or 2-min injection.|$|E
5000|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} {{associated with}} <b>daptomycin</b> therapy include: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Daptomycin</b> is {{approved}} {{for use in}} adults in the United States for skin and skin structure infections caused by Gram-positive infections, S. aureus bacteraemia, and right-sided S. aureus endocarditis. It binds avidly to pulmonary surfactant, so cannot {{be used in the}} treatment of pneumonia. There seems to be a difference in working <b>daptomycin</b> on hematogenous pneumonia.|$|E
50|$|Several newly {{discovered}} strains of MRSA show antibiotic resistance even to vancomycin and teicoplanin. These new {{strains of the}} MRSA bacterium have been dubbed vancomycin intermediate-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA). Linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, <b>daptomycin,</b> ceftaroline, and tigecycline are used to treat more severe infections that {{do not respond to}} glycopeptides such as vancomycin. Current guidelines recommend <b>daptomycin</b> for VISA bloodstream infections and endocarditis.|$|E
50|$|Streptomyces roseosporus is {{a species}} of actinobacteria. It {{produces}} the novel antibiotic <b>daptomycin</b> (US trade name: Cubicin).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Daptomycin</b> is a cyclic lipopeptide {{antibiotic}} {{produced by}} Streptomyces roseosporus. [...] <b>Daptomycin</b> consists of 13 amino acids, 10 {{of which are}} arranged in a cyclic fashion, and three on an exocyclic tail. Two nonproteinogenic amino acids exist in the lipopeptide, the unusual amino acid L-kynurenine (Kyn), only known to <b>daptomycin,</b> and L-3-methylglutamic acid (mGlu). The N-terminus of the exocyclic tryptophan residue is coupled to decanoic acid, a medium-chain (C10) fatty acid. Biosynthesis is initiated by the coupling of decanoic acid to the N-terminal tryptophan, followed by the coupling of the remaining amino acids by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) mechanisms. Finally, a cyclization event occurs, which is catalyzed by a thioesterase enzyme, and subsequent release of the lipopeptide is granted. [...] The NRPS responsible for the synthesis of <b>daptomycin</b> is encoded by three overlapping genes, dptA, dptBC and dptD. The dptE and dptF genes, immediately upstream of dptA, {{are likely to be}} involved in the initiation of <b>daptomycin</b> biosynthesis by coupling decanoic acid to the N-terminal Trp. These novel genes (dptE, dptF [...] ) correspond to products that most likely work in conjunction with a unique condensation domain to acylate the first amino acid (tryptophan). These and other novel genes (dptI, dptJ) are believed to be involved in supplying the nonproteinogenic amino acids L-3-methylglutamic acid and Kyn; they are located next to the NRPS genes.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the formation of spherical micelles by <b>Daptomycin</b> may affect the mode of action.|$|E
50|$|<b>Daptomycin</b> has a {{distinct}} mechanism of action, disrupting multiple aspects of bacterial cell membrane function. It inserts into the cell membrane in a phosphatidylglycerol-dependent fashion, where it then aggregates. The aggregation of <b>daptomycin</b> alters the curvature of the membrane, which creates holes that leak ions. This causes rapid depolarization, resulting {{in a loss of}} membrane potential leading to inhibition of protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death.|$|E
50|$|The study {{started in}} October 2010 {{and had a}} primary {{completion}} date of December 2011 for final data collection for the primary outcome measure. Overall, 215 patients were randomized into either {{one of the three}} brilacidin arms or the active comparator <b>Daptomycin</b> arm. There were three dosing regimens for brilacidin, a low, medium and high dose administered for three days, and one dosing regimen for <b>Daptomycin</b> administered for seven days.|$|E
5000|$|The {{molecular}} engineering of <b>daptomycin,</b> the only marketed acidic lipopeptide antibiotic to date (Figure 8), has seen many advances {{since its inception}} into clinical medicine in 2003. [...] It is an attractive target for combinatorial biosynthesis for many reasons: second generation derivatives are currently in the clinic for development;Streptomyces roseosporus, the producer organism of <b>daptomycin,</b> is amenable to genetic manipulation; the <b>daptomycin</b> biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in S. lividans; the lipopeptide biosynthetic machinery {{has the potential to}} be interrupted by variations of natural precursors, as well as precursor-directed biosynthesis, gene deletion, genetic exchange, and module exchange; the {{molecular engineering}} tools have been developed to facilitate the expression of the three individual NRPS genes from three different sites in the chromosome, using ermEp* for expression of two genes from ectopic loci; other lipopeptide gene clusters, both related and unrelated to <b>daptomycin,</b> have been cloned and sequenced, thus providing genes and modules to allow the generation of hybrid molecules; derivatives can be afforded via chemoenzymatic synthesis; and lastly, efforts in medicinal chemistry are able to further modify these products of molecular engineering.|$|E
50|$|For {{isolates}} with a Vancomycin MIC > 2 Âµg/mL, {{an alternative}} to Vancomycin should be used. The approach is to treat {{with at least one}} agent to which VISA/VRSA is known to be susceptible by invitro testing. The agents that are used include <b>daptomycin,</b> linezolid, telavancin, ceftaroline, quinupristin-dalfopristin. For people with MRSA bacteremia in the setting of vancomycin failure the IDSA recommends high-dose <b>daptomycin,</b> if the isolate is susceptible, in combination with another agent (e.g. gentamicin, rifampin, linezolid, TMP-SMX, or a beta-lactam antibiotic).|$|E
50|$|<b>Daptomycin</b> is {{supplied}} as a sterile, preservative-free, pale yellow to light brown, lyophilised 500- or 350-mg cake {{that must be}} reconstituted with normal saline prior to use.|$|E
50|$|Linezolid or <b>daptomycin</b> is used {{to treat}} VRE infections. The streptogramins, such as quinupristin/dalfopristin, may {{also be used for}} VREs. VRE can be {{successfully}} treated with sultamicillin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Daptomycin</b> is {{bactericidal}} against Gram-positive bacteria only. It {{has proven}} in vitro activity against enterococci (including glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE)), staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), streptococci, corynebacteria and stationary-phase Borrelia burgdorferi persisters.|$|E
50|$|In {{skin and}} soft tissue infections, 4 mg/kg <b>daptomycin</b> is given {{intravenously}} once daily. For S. aureus bacteraemia or right-sided endocarditis, the approved dose is 6 mg/kg given intravenously once daily.|$|E

50|$|The Clinical Trial had {{positive}} results, indicating that single dose brilacidin was comparable to 7 days of <b>daptomycin.</b> The primary endpoint was clinical {{success in the}} intent-to-treat population, defined as reduction of at least 20% in area of the ABSSSI lesion, relative to baseline, when observed 48-72 hours after the first dose of study drug, and no rescue antibiotics administered. All three brilacidin treatment arms (two single-dose regimens and one three-day dose regimen) had clinical success rates comparable to the clinical success rate of the FDA-approved seven-day dosing regimen of <b>daptomycin.</b> All brilacidin treatment regimens were generally well tolerated. There were six serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in the study, none of which were considered related to brilacidin by the principal investigator.|$|E
50|$|<b>Daptomycin,</b> {{originally}} {{designated as}} LY 146032, {{was discovered by}} researchers at Eli Lilly and Company in the late 1980s. LY 146032 showed promise in phase I/II clinical trials for treatment of infection caused by Gram-positive organisms. Lilly ceased development because high-dose therapy was associated with adverse effects on skeletal muscle, including myalgia and potential myositis.|$|E
50|$|For the {{few cases}} thus far, {{vancomycin}} or <b>daptomycin</b> {{has been used}} in tandem with rifampicin for a duration ranging from four weeks to six months. Valve replacement was also required in some cases of infectious endocarditis. Due to its recent pathogenic status, however, few treatments have been tested, and an optimal treatment regimen has yet to be established.|$|E
50|$|In July 2010, the FDA {{issued a}} warning that <b>daptomycin</b> could cause {{life-threatening}} eosinophilic pneumonia. The FDA said it had identified seven confirmed cases of eosinophilic pneumonia between 2004 and 2010 and an additional 36 possible cases. The seven confirmed victims were all older than 60 and symptoms appeared within two weeks of initiation of therapy.|$|E
