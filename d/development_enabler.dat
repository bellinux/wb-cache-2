40|$|Undergraduate Program of Rural Development Drivers (PSP- 3) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{programs}} of Riau Province Youth and Sport Office. The program was developed with the aim of accrediting development through the role of Mentoring, Self-Reliance and Youth pioneering in various youth activities. Through this Rural Development Driving Undergraduate Program (PSP- 3), it is expected to strengthen the commitment of the undergraduate youth to build the village progress and make it a place to improve the living standard of the community in the future. The PSP 3 program has been underway since 1989 under the name of the Rural <b>Development</b> <b>Enabler</b> program (PSP- 3) and has now placed undergraduate degree approximately 18, 173 people spread throughout Indonesia. For example, during 2006 - 2013, the PSP 3 Program has reached 2478 villages, 1249 sub-districts and 440 districts. (Legal Basis of PSP 3 of Regional Regulation Number 19 Year 2001) This study aims to: To find out the process of Appointment of Youth Undergraduate Rural Development Drivers (PSP- 3) On the Department of Youth and Sports Riau Province. To know and analyze the obstacles of the process of appointment of Youth Undergraduates of Rural Development (PSP- 3) in Riau Province Youth and Sports Agency, this research was conducted at Dinas Pemuda dan OlahragaProvinsi Riau, while the result of this research is known that the Appointment of Youth Development Rural (PSP- 3) On the Office of Youth and Sports of Riau Province is lacking in publication so that there are still many people or youth who do not know it and obstacles in the implementation System announcement in the acceptance of PSP 3 is less known by the community, especially youth and Reporting made by Participants are inadequate because it is only a general activity report onl...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to understand the definition and utilization of a key product <b>development</b> <b>enabler,</b> the tools, {{in the development of}} Electrical Distribution Systems inside a sample Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to take in in-depth look at the integration of the system of tools utilized by the commodity department in the development of Electrical Distribution Systems components, and then to identify opportunities for establishing a more efficient system of tools for the compliance of requirements. The study focused on the deliverables required in the fulfillment of requirements as the element for critical comparison. That comparison consisted of the utilization of the current system of tools versus the desired system of tools-a desire system resulting from the fulfillment of requirements that would constitute a "Utopia System". The mapping of deliverables to requirements, and the processing linkage among them were based in the definition of inputs and outputs already identified by the sample OEM for the development of this specific commodity; and the mapping of deliverables to the utilization of tools was enabled by experiential inputs of the author as well as insights gained from interviews with employees at the sample OEM. Structural representations allowed for a better and thorough comprehension of the mapping of deliverables and provided a foundation for understanding the challenges embedded in the desired objective: clustering existing tools for an improved and more effectual integration. Specifically, the mapping of deliverables to the utilization of the current system of tools, allowed for the analysis of efficiency levels and the identification of opportunities for redundancy avoidance. Considering the challenges and sudden changes constantly faced by those in the automotive industry, including those of this OEM, the proposal for optimizing the system of tools was based on network metric comparisons between the current system of tools and the desired system of tools. The proposal for integrating a better system of tools then concluded with a step-by-step plan that could be utilized as an approach for continuous improvement of this key enabler of the product development process-the tools. The desire of this "vision" would be that such optimization would then lead to performance metrics improvements for the EDS department and the product development organization as a whole. by Maria Gabriela Medrano Gonzalez.
