By looking at the verb phrases ten children with SLI in the age range of 6 to 8 years produced in a story-tell-task, an overview is given of the found characteristics. It was hypothesised that children with SLI, similar to TD children, would show a pattern of acquisition in which dummy use precedes the use of conjugation, but that the <b>dummy</b> <b>phase</b> that is extended in the SLI group. The age at which these children start to use dummies is also hypothesised to be higher. The results show that a pattern can be found in which these children indeed use dummies as a preliminary stage to conjugation. The use of dummies, especially in the present tense, decreased where the use of conjugation increased. Further research with more children should be done to confirm that the use of dummies is indeed a preliminary stage to conjugation as found in normal developing children...|$|E

Therefore, it may be expected that sirolimus would display a safety profile without the vasomotor form of nephrotoxicity characteristic of CNIs. Initial studies in rodent models and in psoriasis patients showed that sirolimus alone did not impair renal function. Subsequently, two pivotal, randomized double <b>dummy,</b> <b>phase</b> III trials in human renal transplantation demonstrated that sirolimus exacerbated the nephrotoxicity of full doses of CNIs. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Subsequent experience has shown that cyclosporin A dose reduction, elimination, or avoidance mitigates these effects, particularly in patients distant from the transplant procedure. However, there is concern about recovery from ischemia–reperfusion injury. Animal models suggesting that sirolimus may delay recovery in this setting have been supported by non-randomized experiences at single centers, which have observed an increased incidence of delayed graft function among sirolimus-treated recipients. In contrast, large single- and multi-center studies have not confirmed this finding; impaired renal recovery has been observed in only occasional instances. Thus, present data indicate that sirolimus does not impair the function of an uninjured kidney, but whether the drug acts alone or potentiates conditions that delay recovery after ischemic injury remains to be established by large randomized trials specifically targeted to recipients {{at high risk for}} this complication...|$|E
50|$|In 1985 Ericsson Microwave Systems were {{contracted}} by the Swedish Defence Material Administration {{to develop}} {{what would become}} the PS-890 Erieye AEW radar. In the same year a <b>dummy</b> dual-sided <b>phased</b> array antenna was tested on a twin-engined Fairchild Metro aircraft. In 1987 the Metro aircraft was fitted with the radar system for flight trials. Production of the radar started in 1993 following an order for six radars for the Swedish Air Force for fitment in Saab 340 aircraft. The first two production radars were delivered in 1996.|$|R
30|$|In this article, {{we address}} the {{challenges}} regarding {{the provision of}} channel state information as well as reducing peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of a {{multiple input multiple output}} orthogonal frequency multiplexing (MIMO–OFDM) system. The mean squared error (MSE) of the channel estimate is adopted as the optimization criterion to design pilot symbols for channel estimation in MIMO–OFDM systems with null subcarriers. We design the placement and power distribution to the pilot symbols for multiple transmit antennas to minimize the MSE of the least square (LS) channel estimates. To reduce interference of the pilot symbols transmitted from different antennas, an algorithm to guarantee that pilot symbols are disjoint from any other transmitter pilot set is proposed. To efficiently reduce the PAPR of the MIMO–OFDM signals, a method that mixes <b>dummy</b> symbols and <b>phase</b> information of the pilot symbols is presented. Simulation results based on IEEE 802.16 e are presented to illustrate the superior performance of our proposed channel estimation method over the existing standard and the partially equi-spaced pilot symbols. We also demonstrate that, by mixing the <b>dummy</b> symbols and <b>phase</b> information of the pilot symbols, the PAPR of the MIMO–OFDM signals can significantly be reduced.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the common}} causes of medical {{emergencies}} in Malaysia is the Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB). This bleeding comprises of two types, namely, the variceal bleeding and the non-variceal bleeding. Although, UGIB has been frequently researched in general, not much reference has been done {{with regard to the}} specific factors that affect the type of bleeding. Hence, this research aims at determining these factors via a Multiple Binary Logit (MBL) approach based on the patients’ information obtained from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kota Kinabalu. From the twenty-eight independent variables, three are quantitative would be analyzed, while twenty-five are qualitative would be transformed into <b>dummy</b> variables. Four <b>phases</b> in a model-building approach are executed to obtain the best model. The three qualitative variables (age, systolic blood pressure and Blatchford score) have interacted with the other dummy variables to affect the type of bleeding on the patients. The main contributing factors to the type of bleeding are identified as Race, Blood Urea Nitrogen and Medical Shock since they require no interactions with the other variables in the models...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Enrolment of {{patients}} into a {{randomised controlled trial}} (RCT) in violation of key inclusion or exclusion criteria, may lead to excess avoidable harm. The {{purpose of this paper}} was to systematically identify and review techniques and interventions proven to prevent or avoid inappropriate enrolment {{of patients}} into RCTs. Methods EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Methodology Register, online abstract repositories, and conference websites were searched. Experts were contacted and bibliographies of retrieved papers hand-searched. The search cut-off date was 31 August 2009. Results No primary publications were found. We identified one study in the grey literature (conference abstracts and presentations) reporting the results of an evaluation of the effectiveness of an intervention designed to prevent or avoid inappropriate enrolment of patients into an RCT. In the context of a multicentre trial, use of a <b>dummy</b> enrolment run-in <b>phase</b> was shown to reduce enrolment errors significantly (P Conclusions Our systematic search yielded only one technique or intervention shown to improve adherence to eligibility criteria during enrolment into RCTs. Given the potential harm involved in recruiting patients into a clinical trial in violation of key eligibility criteria, future research is needed to better inform those conducting clinical trials of how best to prevent enrolment errors</p...|$|R
