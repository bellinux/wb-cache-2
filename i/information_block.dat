5000|$|Instead of FS segment {{descriptor}} on x86 {{versions of}} the Windows NT family, GS segment descriptor is used to point to two operating system defined structures: Thread <b>Information</b> <b>Block</b> (NT_TIB) in user mode and Processor Control Region (KPCR) in kernel mode. Thus, for example, in user mode GS:0 is {{the address of the}} first member of the Thread <b>Information</b> <b>Block.</b> Maintaining this convention made the x86-64 port easier, but required AMD to retain the function of the FS and GS segments in long mode — even though segmented addressing per se is not really used by any modern operating system.|$|E

The ability to link a data structure into the display register address scope implemented object orientation. Thus, the B5000 actually used a form of object orientation long before the term was ever used.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} partial {{transmission}} (PT) cooperative strategy, which can overcome the shortcomings aforementioned. Compared to LF, PT allows relays to discard the bits with low soft information {{according to the}} channel state, which in fact allows the relays {{to make the decision}} for the destination. Moreover, the saved power helps to increase the transmit SNR for the useful information. Assuming that the power assumption to send every bit is identical, we implement the optimal block process, where the transmitted information from source is divided into a certain amount of <b>information</b> <b>blocks</b> in relay. The relays obtain the reliability information of the transmitted information bits by implementing the soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoders. With the channel state information (CSI) at receivers, the relays are able to calculate the optimal number of the correctly decoded <b>information</b> <b>blocks.</b> Consequently, the relays only forward the <b>information</b> <b>blocks</b> with low error probability. Correspondingly, the destination employs block combining to jointly decode the message. We derive the end-to-end outage probability of the proposed strategy {{as a function of the}} transmission rate and SNR with M-relaying. In addition, the numerical simulations are carried out in both one-relaying system and two-relaying system. Continuous changing channels show the advantage of the proposed strategy. The results show that the proposed strategy can get more diversity gain from the relay-to-destination channel and provide a significant improvement over the conventional strategies, particularly when the relay cannot reliably decode the message. We note that the more information transmission rate and channel gain from relay to destination are, the greater improvement PT can get.|$|R
