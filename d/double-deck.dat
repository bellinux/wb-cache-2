5|$|Michigan Avenue Bridge is a double-leaf, <b>double-deck,</b> fixed counterweight, {{trunnion}} bascule bridge. It was {{engineered by}} the Chicago Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering; Edward H. Bennett was the consulting architect and William A. Mulcahy {{the chief engineer}} of construction. At the time of construction it {{was believed to be}} the first <b>double-deck</b> bridge ever built to have roadway on both levels; faster non-commercial traffic using the upper deck and slower commercial traffic that served the various industries and docks in the vicinity of the river using the lower deck.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 {{the route}} was {{converted}} to <b>double-deck</b> operation using new Leyland Olympians painted {{in a unique}} white and blue livery with Timesaver branding. Four Leyland Tiger coaches in a yellow and red livery also using the Timesaver name, arrived a year later. The route branding was replaced by Stagecoach's corporate image of white with red, orange and blue stripes following their takeover of Ribble Motor Services in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Route X43 was {{initially}} {{served with a}} mixture of <b>double-deck</b> Leyland Titans and single-deck Leyland Tigers. In the early 1960s these were replaced by new Leyland Leopards. From 1974 coaches were used on the route, with Leyland Leopards again the preferred choice. In 1982 a small number were branded for the route, using the name Timesaver and the tagline Regular Motorway service.|$|E
25|$|National Express West Midlands {{is one of}} {{the largest}} bus {{operators}} in the UK, with a fleet of nearly 1,600 vehicles. A variety of bus types are used, including <b>double-decks,</b> single-decks, articulated and midi-buses.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{originally}} carried NY 52 traffic, {{which was}} light, but {{the construction of}} Interstate 84 pushed the bridge over capacity, and planning for additional capacity began in 1972. After considering <b>double-decking</b> (which the original bridge was not designed for) the decision was taken by NYSBA to add a second parallel span south of the original.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the stadium's construction, Buffalo was hoping to get either an {{expansion}} Major League Baseball team or a relocated team; Buffalo was one of the five finalists in the early 1990s National League expansion process, which led to the 1993 debuts of the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins. The ballpark was built with a seating capacity of 19,500 people, which makes it the third largest stadium in minor league baseball. The design allows for future expansion to accommodate a major league team: capacity could be increased to nearly 40,000 by <b>double-decking</b> the existing mezzanine.|$|R
5|$|The post-war {{years were}} also a period of major bridge {{building}} in the state. The Mackinac Bridge opened on November 1, 1957, the Portage Lake Lift Bridge, the largest <b>double-deck</b> lift bridge was completed in August 1959, and the International Bridge opened across the St. Marys River three years later on October 31, 1962. The State Highway Department started erecting mileposts along the Interstates in 1963, and later expanded the practice to other freeways and used the mileages to number the interchanges along I-94.|$|E
5|$|Double deck buses show an {{intermediate}} points display, {{as well as}} a final destination. The company's double decker buses are unique in Scotland in still displaying the destination at both the front and rear. In early mornings and late evenings, some services are curtailed to the city centre or to early termini, in the transition to the night bus service. In such cases, 'Part Route' is displayed in the intermediate display. Certain routes have all day short working termini, and minor diversions which are often indicated through the use of internal or external 'tram boards'. Since 2006 <b>double-deck</b> deliveries feature a 'Route Diverted; intermediate display, used when road closures cause a service to be diverted from its normal route.|$|E
5|$|The Flushing Line west of 103rd Street {{opened in}} 1917. The IRT agreed {{to operate the}} line under the {{condition}} that any loss of profits would be repaid by the city. As part of the agreement, the PSC would build the line eastward to at least Flushing. The station, as well as two other stations at Willets Point Boulevard and 111th Street, was approved in 1921 as part of an extension of the Flushing Line past 103rd Street. Construction of the station and the <b>double-deck</b> bridge over the Flushing Creek began on April 21, 1923, with the station built via cut-and-cover methods. The bridge was completed in 1927, and the station opened on January 21, 1928, over a decade after the line initially began operation.|$|E
50|$|When {{not on the}} {{guideway}} buses run {{on roads}} alongside normal traffic. On the guideway buses are kept on track by small guide wheels, angled at 90 degrees to the normal road wheels, which run along the kerb edges of the guideway. The route that runs on the guideway is Superoute 66, run with Volvo B7TL double deck buses. Before that, Scania single-deck buses (which were later transferred to First Glasgow when the new <b>double-decks</b> entered service) and standard-floor Dennis Darts (which are withdrawn) were used: only three main types of bus have been used on the service {{since its inception in}} 1994.|$|R
50|$|When London Transport was {{established}} in 1933 it inherited about three hundred TD1 and TD2 Leyland Titans from independent bus operators in London and the home counties, which they classed TD. It also commissioned a batch of 100 TD4s bodied by Leyland with the standard Leyland steel framed body of the time modified to LPTB requirements (to look like the existing STL class) in 1936 (STD1-100), to evaluate against the board's standard AEC Regent <b>double-decks</b> (STL-class) most of which had hardwood-framed bodies built by LPTB. STD91-100 were TD4c with torque-converter transmission as built, but, on first overhaul, were converted to standard Leyland manual gearboxes.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, a 2 mi set of {{elevated}} express lanes {{were added}} to I-35 between 15th Street and Airport Boulevard. The reason <b>double-decking</b> was used is because the highway is bounded in the area by the University of Texas campus on the west and by the Mount Calvary Cemetery on the east, restricting the available right-of-way. The lower deck kept its original configuration, which featured short on- and off-ramps with limited visibility. In 2000, some off-ramps on the lower deck were removed, {{in response to the}} already dangerous conditions becoming more so as traffic levels on the road increased. Interstate 35 in general and the double-decked section in particular have been viewed as a social dividing line between the central Austin and U.T. communities and the more economically depressed East Austin neighborhoods.|$|R
5|$|The first {{vehicle to}} be bought by Tillingbourne was a {{single-deck}} Chevrolet with 14 seats, which entered service on {{the launch of the}} company's first route in 1924. It was joined by a similar Overland Automobile bus later in the year. Two further vehicles had been purchased by 1928, when a depot fire destroyed three of the four buses. They were replaced by second-hand buses including an 18-seat Dennis and several Thornycroft A2 vehicles. From November 1934 until the outbreak of World War II, these were progressively replaced by new buses, also built by Thornycroft. The first <b>double-deck</b> vehicle {{to be bought}} was a Bristol K Type, which joined the fleet in 1959. Eight Guy Vixens were bought from London Transport between 1963 and 1964 to replace the entire previous fleet. These were succeeded by a wide variety of types, with Bedford coaches and buses the most numerous. In the 1970s, a number of second-hand Bristol SUL4A's, with ECW B36F bodies, were operated.|$|E

25|$|VR {{introduced}} its first <b>double-deck</b> sleeping cars on 1 February 2006. The two-bed cabins {{on the upper}} deck have toilets and showers while cabins on the lower deck use shared ones. <b>Double-deck</b> driving-trailers were introduced during late 2013 and restaurant cars in early 2014.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, {{production}} {{peaked at}} Roe, with 182 bodies built, the highest total since 1966 (the year when <b>double-decks</b> were finally {{allowed to be}} operated without a conductor, the first bus to do so, {{on the day of}} the law change, being a Great Yarmouth Roe-bodied Atlantean). The standard body was phased out in 1981, as the Fleetline had been discontinued and the Atlantean could not be sold after 1983 as it fell foul of noise-pollution laws. In 1981 the Park Royal coachworks were closed. The new body to take its place was for the new Leyland Olympian chassis and Roe produced 299 of these prior to closure. Most went to three fleets, West Yorkshire PTE and NBC subsidiaries Bristol Omnibus Company and London Country, with one batch to Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive and a sole vehicle to the Scottish Arts Council, which was equipped as a travelling art gallery.|$|R
50|$|Muehlebach had {{anticipated}} that Kansas City would eventually get {{a major league}} team, and had built the stadium with footings sufficiently strong to support a second deck. However, when work began on <b>double-decking</b> the stadium, {{it was discovered that}} the footings were no longer strong enough to support the weight of a second deck. City officials elected to almost completely demolish the stadium and rebuild from scratch. The city ran three shifts and the new stadium was built in 90 days, completed in time for the April 1955 opening. The new construction was financed by a bond issuance. The expanded stadium was supposed to seat 38,000, but cost overruns as a result of overtime payments forced officials to reduce capacity to just over 30,000. The Braves Field scoreboard was purchased for $100,000 and moved from Boston to Kansas City, while temporary bleachers were added in the left field corner and parts of the outfield.|$|R
40|$|The {{idea that}} no amount of {{infrastructure}} building can relieve congestion has become a common theme among many planners, policy makers and politicians. Many claiming that increasing road capacity by improving current roads or by building new ones actually increase congestion due to induced demand. Many of these same people would advocate that the only true way to relieve congestion is to reduce demand of the auto system through increased transit use, bicycle traffic, and pedestrian travel. The point of this policy brief is not to determine if reducing demand would work to relieve congestion, but to look into the converse approach of increasing supply, or in other words, building more roads. The concept is simple, if there is not enough space on the roads to allow for free flowing traffic, increase the space on the roads. By increasing road capacity, more cars and trucks will be able to move through congested areas quicker. A number of suggestions have been made to accomplish this goal in areas where road ways cannot be easily widen, including separate lanes for buses and trucks, tunnels, and <b>double-decking</b> freeways. All, of course, come with a price. The U. S. Department of Transportation has suggested travel time could be cut by 1 percent a year with additional $ 94 billion in annual surface transportation spending 1. Background of Road Construction So why has traffic congestion gotten so bad? Congestion has increased for one primary reason. There has been large growth in the total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) along with an increase in total drivers, that has not been accompanied by an equivalent growth in road space. Simple economics tell us that if increasing demands are not meet with increased supply, cost, or in this case congestion, will rise...|$|R
25|$|The chief {{executive}} of Eurostar, Richard Brown, suggested that the trains could be replaced by <b>double-deck</b> trains similar to the TGV Duplex when they are withdrawn. A <b>double-deck</b> fleet could carry 40million passengers per year from Britain to Continental Europe, equivalent to adding an extra runway at a London airport.|$|E

40|$|As {{buildings}} rise higher, designers face {{two major}} issues. Firstly, how to design efficient structures {{to resist the}} lateral loads that impact so greatly on tall buildings. Secondly, how to effectively integrate building systems, which often consume large amounts of space in taller buildings and potentially detract from the building aesthetics. Double‐layer space structures {{have the potential to}} address these issues due to several beneficial design characteristics. As three‐dimensional structures, double‐layer space structures are rigid and structurally efficient. They can also integrate with other building systems by using the inherent structural cavities to accommodate services components and contribute a particular architectural aesthetic if their regular pattern is exposed. Double‐layer space structures have been used in long‐span structure buildings, but have yet to be applied as vertical structures for super‐tall buildings. Only two projects, proposed by Kahn and Tying, and Swenson, have applied double‐layer space structures as vertical structures in high‐rise buildings. However, they have not yet been executed and no literature has discussed the feasibility of the application of this structural system to supertall buildings. This situation leads to the research question; “Are double‐layer space structures suitable for super‐tall buildings?” To answer this question, a long‐term study with multidisciplinary knowledge, involving surveys of public opinion, and possibly real pilot projects would be required. This research focuses only on structural efficiency and systems integration as the initial step of the study of vertical double‐layer space structures in super‐tall buildings. The main objective of this research is to analyse the efficiency of this structural system, especially compared to other current tall structural systems. The second objective is to investigate to what extent these structures can integrate with other building systems as well as a discussion on advantages and disadvantages of the integration. The significance of this research is to provide initial scientific information for designers about the possibility of using double‐layer space structures as a structural system of super‐tall building. A research methodology including both quantitative and qualitative approaches is employed to measure the structural efficiency of vertical double‐layer space structures and to assess their potential to integrate with other building systems. This research covers structural aspects, building services systems including fire safety and approaches to energy efficiency, architectural integration, and construction. A quantitative approach by structural design and analysis, and comparison of double‐layer space structures with other structural systems is used to analyse structural efficiency. Case studies using the structural models of two 100 ‐storey double‐layer space structure buildings with different values of slenderness are designed and analysed using the computer software, ETABS. Other currently used structural systems, a bundled‐tube, a braced‐tube and a diagrid, are also designed using the same configuration and their structural analysis findings are compared to those of double‐layer space structures. Services systems, including HVAC, stairs and elevators, are also designed and integrated with the structure. The systems integration aspect of this research in double‐layer space structure buildings is analysed using a qualitative approach in three main steps. The first step is a review of relevant literature covering systems integration and current technologies in tall buildings. Based on this review, systems integration in double‐layer space structure buildings in general and the 100 ‐storey case study buildings in particular are explored using computer models. As the final step, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the systems integration in the designed case studies are discussed. These case studies are designed in order to represent current super‐tall buildings and recent technologies in high‐rise buildings. The structural models of 100 ‐storey buildings are relevant for buildings in the approximate range of 75 to 125 storeys or 300 to 500 metres high; the majority of current super‐tall buildings have been built in that range of heights. Recent technologies that are commonly used in super‐tall buildings, for example Centralised Air Handling and Localised Air Handling for HVAC system, <b>double‐decking</b> and sky lobbies for elevator system, and various façade systems, are adopted in these case studies. The aim is The Suitability of Double‐layer Space Structures for Super‐tall Buildings to investigate if double‐layer space structures can accommodate building components of current technologies. The results of this research show that double‐layer space structures are efficient where applied in super‐tall buildings when compared to other existing structural systems. Doublelayer space structures can also integrate with services components. The case study design shows how larger usable floor areas than those in typical tall buildings can be provided by positioning the majority of services and structural components within the space structure on the perimeter of the building. In terms of fire safety, positioning fire safety and egress systems in two different locations far apart, as proposed in this research, increases their reliability. Double‐layer space structures are highly redundant structures that enable loads to be transferred through other structural members if several structural members collapse. This advantage minimises the possibility of progressive collapse. The ability of double‐layer space structures to visually and physically integrate with architectural components and aspects like façade, interior space and building geometry in various ways is also explored. In terms of construction, simple connections and construction methods can be applied to double‐layer space structures leading to competitive construction costs. The research concludes by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of double‐layer space structures for super‐tall buildings and concludes that double‐layer space structures are indeed suitable for this application within the scope of this research. However, the study also recommends future research to address issues that are not covered in this research...|$|R
