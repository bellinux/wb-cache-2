5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} prevents the solar wind, {{a stream of}} ionized particles emitted by the Sun, from interacting directly with its atmosphere, and instead diverts {{it away from the}} planet, effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma {{different from that of the}} solar wind. The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere is so large that the Sun and its visible corona would fit inside it with room to spare. <b>If</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> see it from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the full moon in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} rapidly {{reproduce}} HeLa cells {{in a laboratory}} setting has led to many important breakthroughs in biomedical research. For example, by 1954, Jonas Salk was using HeLa cells in his research to develop the polio vaccine. To test his new vaccine, the cells were mass-produced in the first-ever cell production factory. Additionally, Chester M. Southam, a leading virologist, injected HeLa cells into cancer patients, prison inmates, and healthy individuals in order to observe if cancer could be transmitted {{as well as to}} examine <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> become immune to cancer by developing an acquired immune response.|$|E
5|$|To {{transform}} a probabilistically checkable proof system {{of this type}} into a clique problem, one forms a graph with a vertex for each possible accepting run of the proof checker. That is, a vertex is defined {{by one of the}} possible random choices of sets of positions to examine, and by bit values for those positions that would cause the checker to accept the proof. Two vertices are adjacent, in this graph, if the corresponding two accepting runs see the same bit values at every position they both examine. Each (valid or invalid) proof string corresponds to a clique, the set of accepting runs that see that proof string, and all maximal cliques arise in this way. One of these cliques is large if and only if it corresponds to a proof string that many proof checkers accept. If the original satisfiability instance is satisfiable, it will have a valid proof string, one that is accepted by all runs of the checker, and this string will correspond to a large clique in the graph. However, if the original instance is not satisfiable, then all proof strings are invalid, each proof string has {{only a small number of}} checker runs that mistakenly accept it, and all cliques are small. Therefore, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> distinguish in polynomial time between graphs that have large cliques and graphs in which all cliques are small, or <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> accurately approximate the clique problem, then applying this approximation to the graphs generated from satisfiability instances would allow satisfiable instances to be distinguished from unsatisfiable instances. However, this is not possible unless P=NP.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Bacon, the {{influential}} work of Pseudo-Geber (sometimes identified as Paul of Taranto) appeared. His Summa Perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity {{with which they}} were described. By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could {{have an effect on the}} human body (for example, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the human soul). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God.|$|E

500|$|The clique {{decision}} problem is NP-complete. It {{was one of}} Richard Karp's original 21 problems shown NP-complete in his 1972 paper [...] "Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems".

Because of the hardness of the {{decision problem}}, the problem of finding a maximum clique is also NP-hard. <b>If</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> solve it, one could also solve the decision problem, by comparing {{the size of the}} maximum clique to the size parameter given as input in the decision problem.|$|E

500|$|By February 1938 Reich's visa had expired.

500|$|In 1986, Marks {{wrote that}} the German foreign office, {{supported}} by military and civilian notables, [...] "focused on Article 231... hoping that, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> refute German responsibility for the war, not only reparations but the entire treaty would collapse". Manfred Boemeke, Gerald Feldman, and Elisabeth Glaser wrote that [...] "pragmatic requirements characteristically influenced the shaping of the much misunderstood Article 231. That paragraph reflected the presumed legal necessity to define German responsibility {{for the war in}} order to specify and limit the Reich's obligations". P.M.H. Bell wrote that despite the article not using the term 'guilt', and while [...] "it may be that its drafters did not intend to convey a moral judgement of Germany", the article has [...] "almost universally" [...] became known as the war guilt clause of the treaty. Margaret MacMillan {{wrote that the}} German public's interpretation of Article 231 as unequivocally ascribing the fault for the war to Germany and her allies, [...] "came to be the object of particular loathing in Germany and the cause of uneasy consciences among the Allies."

500|$|According to Milton Wolf and Mike Ashley, {{historians of}} science fiction, {{over the next}} two years Sloane {{published}} some of the best sf of the early years of the field in Amazing Stories Quarterly. [...] Wolf and Ashley cite [...] "Paradox", by Charles Cloukey, an early time-travel story; The Bridge of Light, by A. Hyatt Verrill, a novel about a lost civilization in South America; The Birth of a New Republic, by Miles J. Breuer and Jack Williamson, in which a man of the 24th century reminisces about a revolt by the inhabitants of the Moon rebel against the Earth; [...] "Paradise and Iron", by Breuer; and White Lily, by Eric Temple Bell, under the pseudonym John Taine, about a form of crystal life that endangers the planet. [...] After 1931, according to Wolf and Ashley, the fiction in Amazing Stories Quarterly became less entertaining. [...] Everett Bleiler, the author of a detailed review of the first ten years of science fiction magazines, is less complimentary, describing John W. Campbell, Jr.'s space operas, which appeared from 1930 to 1932, as [...] "turgid", and commenting that only a dozen or so of the stories in the magazine's entire run [...] "might have been considered worth reading <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> put oneself back in the 1930s, accepting the standards of the time". [...] Bleiler mentions three authors, Coblentz, Taine, and Breuer, as having produced notably original material, but adds that their work was [...] "not strong enough for mainstream fiction" [...] and had [...] "too little action and too much sophistication for pulp". [...] Bleiler does however agree with Wolf and Ashley that the magazines's quality declined over time. [...] Brian Stableford, in the Science Fiction Encyclopedia, also highlights Coblentz, Taine and Breuer, along with Williamson and Verrill, among the magazine's contributors; Stableford regards their contributions as being among [...] "the most important early pulp sf novels".|$|E
