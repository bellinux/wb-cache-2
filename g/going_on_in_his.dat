5|$|Don't Look Now is {{particularly}} indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several {{characteristics of the}} director's work. The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the screech of a drill references a cut in The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes {{a suspect in the}} murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations of what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|E

With {{everything}} he does for Dream Theater as well as his life in general, that his [...] "wheels are always in constant motion", and that he's always juggling many different projects or responsibilities for the band at the same time. So the lyrics are a representation for whats <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> head on any given day.|$|E

I think {{what was on the}} page, what I foresawnot knowing where it was going, because no one would ever tell me anythingthere was always a lot more <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> head than he was going to show anybody, including his sons. Because, indeed, {{there was a lot more}} going on." [...] Kripke later confirmed this, stating, [...] "It's our view that John knew everything the producers of the show know. John knew stuff we're not even ready to reveal, that won't come out for a couple of seasons. He was an awesome hunter, and by the time he showed up in 'Dead Man's Blood', he knew it all." ...|$|E

50|$|By 1965, {{there was}} a great deal of {{political}} tension in Indonesia, especially between the Army and the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). The PKI, which had slowly but surely gained a footing in Indonesian politics, was now set to become the most powerful political party because of their association with President Sukarno. In September 1965, Basuki grew wary of communist activities in East Java and went to Jakarta to report his observations to the Commander of the Army, Ahmad Yani. They met on the evening of 30 September when Basuki met with Yani and reported of the <b>goings</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> province. Yani complimented Basuki on the report and wanted him to accompany him to his meeting with the President the following morning to relay his story of Communist activities.|$|R

HitFix's Gregory Ellwood praised the performance, writing [...] "note to Lorne Michaels: whatever West {{had to do}} to let you break form and come up with such a visually stunning and impressive {{performance was}} well, well worth it. This is memorable television. Hands down." [...] E!

[...] Kevin O'Donnell of Spin wrote that West delivered one of the show's [...] "most unique performances of all-time." [...] West performed the song in an entirely red outfit.|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, Declan and Kate's {{relationship}} {{ended when}} Kate chose {{to break up}} with him after he began pushing her away. Declan starts a new job and he later lies to his family in front of her. Mullally said [...] "Declan's been pushing Kate away, he has so much <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life. He's holding on to these massive pieces of information that he feels he can't share with anyone – not even Kate." [...] When Kate sees Declan lying to his mother, she believes {{that he is not}} the boy she fell for and does not know if she can trust him. Mullally said that Declan is not prepared for the moment Kate breaks up with him and he is confused. Declan goes to Ringo Brown's (Sam Clark) bucks night where he meets Kate's rival, Candace Carey (Sheona Urquhart), who makes it clear that she is attracted to him. Declan and Candace later share a kiss, which Kate sees. Mullally said [...] "Candace gets talking to Declan and is there for him, he wants comfort and makes that split-second decision to kiss her. He doesn't think about the consequences". Declan does not know Kate saw them together and Mullally added that he hoped they could move on as they [...] "really do work as a couple".|$|E
500|$|Previous {{series of}} Jonathan Creek had {{featured}} first Caroline Quentin, and then Julia Sawalha as Jonathan's assistants Maddy Magellan and Carla Borrego, respectively. Quentin {{departed from the}} show {{at the end of}} its third series in 2000 in order to try for a second child, while Sawalha temporarily retired from acting in 2004, having become so disillusioned that she was [...] "dragging self out of bed" [...] by the end of the show's fourth series in order to film episodes. Davies explained that Renwick had always believed Jonathan needed a sidekick character, and that: [...] "You can't really have Jonathan Creek without his sounding board when all the stuff is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mind. In a novel you can have an interior monologue when a leading character is working out what's going on, but for a film or television you have to have Dr Watson for Sherlock Holmes, it's somebody for Holmes to explain it to." [...] For [...] "The Grinning Man", a new sidekick was created in the form of Joey Ross, played by actress Sheridan Smith. Renwick described the opportunity to work with Smith as a major catalyst in his decision to revive the show. The actress had previously appeared in his series Love Soup, and Renwick's wife suggested pairing her with Davies in the new episode. Smith was approached about the role before the episode's script was written, and after readily agreeing to take the part of Ross, Renwick wrote the character's dialogue with Smith's northern accent in mind. The actress found accustoming herself to [...] "detective talk" [...] the hardest part of the role, explaining: [...] "You slow down, and then speed up at the end. I kept watching Alan and going, 'I can’t do this figuring out talk.' But I learned from the master." [...] Smith enjoyed the challenge the role presented, stating: [...] "He's [...] written this feisty little northern character, and I am really honoured because he's such a great writer. I have always played chavs and slappers so I wasn't used to being an intelligent young girl." ...|$|E

The Little Prince was created when Saint-Exupéry was [...] "an expatriate and distraught about what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> country and in the world". It was written during his 27-month sojourn in North America, almost as a sort of credo, [...] "carefully employing the expressions of despair, loneliness, and triumph throughout its plotline".|$|E

2500|$|While the author's {{personal}} life was frequently chaotic, his creative process while writing was disciplined. Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan Library and Museum which had obtained Saint-Exupéry's original manuscript in 1968, stated: [...] "On the one hand, {{he had a}} clear vision for the shape, tone, and message of the story. On the other hand, he was ruthless about chopping out entire passages that just weren't quite right", eventually distilling the 30,000 word manuscript, accompanied by small illustrations and sketches, to approximately half its original length. [...] The story, the curator added, was created when he was [...] "an ex-patriate and distraught about what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> country and in the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Orzack's {{continued}} {{research into}} computer game addiction started {{to focus on}} multiplayer computer games, such as The Sims, EverQuest and World of Warcraft. Describing one of her patients who was regularly missing college lessons and becoming violent, she said [...] "Something is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life that he is escaping. In the game, he finds a sense of belonging. Some say escape and some say fun, but most {{want to be part}} of an organization." [...] Orzack then went on to say that these people are roleplaying and feel part of an organisation, something they may lack outside of the game. She also stated that some patients have been known to take drugs in order to continue playing, making her feel that the addiction is worse than that of drink or drugs. Withdrawal from gaming is not something Orzack recommended, as she felt this could lead to depression and violence.|$|E
