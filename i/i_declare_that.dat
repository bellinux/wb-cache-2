500|$|Fidel Castro's {{religious}} beliefs {{have been a}} matter of some debate; he was baptized and raised a Roman Catholic, but he identified himself later in life as an atheist. He criticized use of the Bible to justify the oppression of women and Africans, but commented that Christianity exhibited [...] "a group of very humane precepts" [...] which gave the world [...] "ethical values" [...] and a [...] "sense of social justice", relating, [...] "If people call me Christian, not from the standpoint of religion but from the standpoint of social vision, <b>I</b> <b>declare</b> <b>that</b> I am a Christian." [...] He was an exponent of the idea that Jesus Christ was a communist, citing the feeding of the 5,000 and the story of Jesus and the rich young man as evidence.|$|E

After Prime Minister Pearson doused the Expo flame, Governor General Michener closed Expo at Place des Nations with the mournful spontaneous farewell: [...] "It is with great regret that <b>I</b> <b>declare</b> <b>that</b> the Universal and International Exhibition of 1967 has come to an official end." [...] All rides and the minirail were shut down by 3:50p.m., and the Expo grounds closed at 4:00p.m., with the last Expo Express train leaving for Place d'Accueil at that time. [...] A fireworks display, that went on for an hour, was Expo's concluding event.|$|E
500|$|The {{first four}} {{numbers of the}} Journal {{featured}} Fielding's contributions to the [...] "Paper War", a conflict he instigated with writers of other contemporary periodicals to generate sales. In the first number, along with the promise to avoid the dullness of other periodicals, Fielding confronted [...] "the armies of Grub Street" [...] and proclaimed his disdain for the literary critics of the day: [...] "As to my brother authors, who, like mere mechanics, are envious and jealous of a rival in their trade, to silence their jealousies and fears, <b>I</b> <b>declare</b> <b>that</b> {{it is not my}} intention to encroach on the business now carried on by them, nor to deal in any of those wares which they at present vend to the public." [...] Also given in the inaugural number was [...] "An introduction to a journal of the present paper-war between the forces under Sir Alexander Drawcansir, and the army of Grub Street", written in the tradition of Jonathan Swift's Battle of the Books.|$|E

2500|$|On 3 May 1792, he {{supported}} the proposition of Beugnot which provoked an accusatory decree from Marat and the abbé Royou, and on 8 May, at the Assembly, he addressed the Jacobins in these terms: [...] "You wish, sirs, to save the Constitution; and yet, you cannot do so without beating down factions and the factious, without setting everything besides {{the rule of law}} to one side, without dying with the Law and for the Law, and <b>I</b> <b>declare</b> <b>that</b> I shall not be the last who shall die with you, in order to see it preserved; believe it, sirs...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haussmann {{himself did}} not deny the {{military}} value of the wider streets. In his Memoires, he wrote that his new boulevard Sebastopol resulted in the [...] "gutting of old Paris, of the quarter of riots and barricades." [...] He admitted he sometimes used this argument with the parliament to justify {{the high cost of}} his projects, arguing that they were for national defense and should be paid for, at least partially, by the state. He wrote: [...] "But, as for me, I who was the promoter of these additions made to original project, <b>I</b> <b>declare</b> <b>that</b> I never thought in the least, in adding them, of their greater or lesser strategic value." [...] The Paris urban historian Patrice de Moncan wrote: [...] "To see the works created by Haussmann and Napoleon III only from the perspective of their strategic value is very reductive. The Emperor was a convinced follower of Saint-Simon. His desire to make Paris, the economic capital of France, a more open, more healthy city, not only for the upper classes but also for the workers, cannot be denied, and should be recognised as the primary motivation." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 1 August 2010, the Russian Islamist website Kavkaz Center claimed Umarov had officially {{announced}} his resignation {{for health reasons}} and appointed his military deputy Aslambek Vadalov as his successor. He appointed Vadalov saying [...] "that jihad should be led by younger and more energetic commanders." [...] Although {{he added that he}} would [...] "continue to wage jihad and will do his utmost to help the new leadership. [...] does not mean that I give up jihad. I will do whatever I can by word and deed." [...] On 4 August, he contradicted the claim issued by him on video saying [...] "Due to the situation in the Caucasus I consider that it is impossible for me to quit my duties. The previous declaration is annulled. It is a falsification. <b>I</b> <b>declare</b> <b>that</b> my health is good to serve Allah. And I will serve the word of Allah and work to kill the enemies of Allah in all the time that he gives me to live on this earth." [...] He called the initial video a [...] "fabrication," [...] but did not say why there was a conflict. Later in 2010, Vadalov and the Arab mujahid Muhannad attempted to overthrow Umarov {{as the leader of the}} Caucasus Emirate. The [...] "supreme judge" [...] of the group, Sayfullah and Emir Adam, the [...] "governor of Ingushetia province", continued to support Umarov. Umarov blamed the split in the organization for Muhannad, who was killed by Russian forces in April 2011, paving the way for re-unification. In July 2011, the insurgents' supreme Islamic court ruled in favour of recognizing Umarov as the leader of the Caucasus Emirate. Amir Khamzat, the commander of the Riyad-us-Saliheen Martyr Brigade suicide battalion was named the commander of the western sector; Hussein Gakayev was named to lead the eastern sector. Vadalov and Tarkhan Gaziyev consequently followed suit and re-affirmed their allegiance to Umarov. Umarov then warned Russia that it would be the target of a new strengthened insurgency as he promised a year of [...] "blood and tears" [...] as a result of the new unity.|$|E
