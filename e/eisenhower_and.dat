5|$|<b>Eisenhower</b> <b>and</b> Smith's {{offices were}} in a {{subterranean}} complex. Smith's office was spartan, dominated by a large portrait of Marshall. An advanced command post codenamed Sharpener was established near Portsmouth, where Montgomery's 21st Army Group and Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay's Allied Naval Expeditionary Force headquarters were located.|$|E
5|$|Groves and Parsons {{drafted a}} {{proposed}} organization and charter for the AFSWP, which they sent to <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>and</b> Nimitz for approval in July 1947. Groves {{did not get}} everything that he asked for; he wanted a status {{equal to that of}} a deputy to the Chief of Staff and Chief of Naval Operations, but the most that <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>and</b> Nimitz would allow was a status equal to that of the heads of a technical service, although Groves still reported directly to them. They also characterized his role as a staff post rather than a command, although Groves was already exercising the functions of a commander at Sandia. After the National Security Act of 1947 created an independent Air Force, Groves reported to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force as well, and was given a second deputy chief from the Air Force, Major General Roscoe C. Wilson, who had worked on the Silverplate project during the war.|$|E

5|$|Solidifying his {{reputation}} as a hard-driving and assertive leader, Shoup rose through the senior leadership of the Marine Corps, overhauling fiscal affairs, logistics, and recruit training. He was selected as commandant by President Dwight D. <b>Eisenhower,</b> <b>and</b> later served in the administration of John F. Kennedy. He reformed the Corps, emphasizing combat readiness and fiscal efficiency, against what was perceived as politicking among its officers.|$|E
5|$|Word of the {{incidents}} spread, eventually reaching Patton's superior, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who ordered him to apologize to the men. Patton's actions were initially suppressed in the news until journalist Drew Pearson publicized them in the United States. While the U.S. Congress {{and the general public}} expressed both support and disdain for Patton's actions, <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>and</b> Army Chief of Staff George Marshall opted not to fire Patton as a commander. He was nonetheless sidelined from combat command for almost a year.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from those}} who became generals, the best known member of the class is Louis A.

He was wounded in battle while serving in France during World War I, and later played in the National Football League for the Canton Bulldogs in the 1925 NFL season. He became a soldier of fortune, training Iran's Persian Guard, working with the Chinese Army in the 1930s, and serving in the French Foreign Legion.

5|$|Diệm {{left the}} {{mainland}} on May 19, and his final stop was in Hawaii, {{where he was}} a guest of Admiral Felix Stump, the commander of United States Pacific Fleet. The reason for the visit was to discuss Diệm's concerns over America's reaction if South Vietnam came under communist attack. Stump reiterated Washington's opinions that nuclear weapons would be used to defend any anti-communist country that was attacked by communists, in accordance with public statements made by <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>and</b> Dulles. He said the Americans would do so by dropping nuclear weapons on communist China.|$|E
5|$|For the {{invasion}} of Normandy Belfast was made headquarters ship of Bombardment Force E flying the flag of Rear-Admiral Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton, and was to support landings by British and Canadian forces in the Gold and Juno Beach sectors. On 2 June Belfast left the River Clyde for her bombardment areas. That morning Prime Minister Winston Churchill had announced his intention {{to go to sea}} with the fleet and witness {{the invasion}} from HMS Belfast. This was opposed by the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. <b>Eisenhower,</b> <b>and</b> the First Sea Lord, Sir Andrew Cunningham. An intervention by the King eventually prevented Churchill from going.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Weinberg coauthored {{the first}} nuclear reactor textbook, The Physical Theory of Neutron Chain Reactors, with Wigner. The {{following}} year, 1959, {{he was elected}} president of the American Nuclear Society and, in 1960, began service on the President's Science Advisory Committee under the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>and</b> Kennedy administrations. Starting in 1945 with Patent #2,736,696, Weinberg, usually with Wigner, filed numerous patents on the light water reactor (LWR) technology that has provided the United States' primary nuclear reactors. The main LWR types are Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) and Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs), that serve in Naval propulsion and commercial nuclear power. In 1965 he was appointed vice president of Union Carbide's Nuclear Division.|$|E

5|$|In August 1943, Smith and Strong flew to Lisbon via Gibraltar in {{civilian}} clothes, where {{they met with}} Generale di Brigata Giuseppe Castellano at the British embassy. While Castellano had hoped to arrange terms for Italy to join the United Nations against Nazi Germany, Smith was empowered to draw up an armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces, but {{he was unable to}} negotiate political matters. On September 3, Smith and Castellano signed the agreed-upon text on behalf of <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>and</b> Pietro Badoglio, respectively, in a simple ceremony beneath an olive tree at Cassibile, Sicily. In October, Smith traveled to Washington for two weeks to represent Eisenhower in a series of meetings, including one with President Roosevelt at Hyde Park, New York, on 10 October.|$|E
5|$|NATO's unity was {{breached}} {{early in}} its history with a crisis occurring during Charles de Gaulle's presidency of France. De Gaulle protested against the USA's strong role in the organization and what he perceived as a special relationship {{between it and the}} United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D. <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>and</b> Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 17 September 1958, he argued {{for the creation of a}} tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the US and the UK.|$|E

Groves considered the risk that the Germans might attempt to disrupt the Normandy landings with radioactive poisons was sufficient to warn General Dwight D. <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>and</b> send an officer to brief his chief of staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith. Under the codename Operation Peppermint, special equipment was prepared and Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use.|$|E

5|$|The first {{member of}} the class to wear a star was Esteves, who was {{appointed}} adjutant general of Puerto Rico with the rank of brigadier general in February 1939. During World War II, <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>and</b> Bradley rose to four-star rank. They made decisions that dramatically affected the careers of their classmates. Concerned that Major General Roscoe Woodruff, whose VII Corps was scheduled to spearhead the Normandy landings, had no amphibious experience, Bradley replaced him with Major General J. Lawton Collins. Woodruff returned to the United States. He later distinguished himself {{in command of the}} 24th Infantry Division in amphibious operations in the Philippines campaign.|$|E

In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D. <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>and</b> Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 17 September 1958, he argued {{for the creation of}} a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the United States and the United Kingdom, and also for the expansion of NATO's coverage to include geographical areas of interest to France, most notably French Algeria, where France was waging a counter-insurgency and sought NATO assistance.|$|E
