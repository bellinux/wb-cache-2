30|$|Results Fluoro-cis-cyclooctene {{derivatives}} and mesylate precursors were synthesized in 3 - 35 % overall yields. The trans-for-cis micro-photoisomerization reached {{yields of}} 48 %.

Radiosynthesis of [18 F]trans-EB- 70 was achieved in 60 min, with 12 % radiochemical yield (decay-corrected), a radiochemical purity > 99 % (for at least 2 h), and 70 - 188 GBq.μmol- 1 specific activity.

40|$|Primary immune {{deficiency}} diseases (PIDs) are {{a heterogeneous}} group of inherited diseases characterized by variable genetic immune defects, conferring susceptibility to recurrent infections. They have {{a vast array}} of manifestations some of which involve the gastrointestinal and <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>systems.</b> These complications can be the consequence of five different factors, namely, infection, autoimmune process, unregulated inflammation, malignancies and complications of therapeutic intervention. They may precede the PID diagnosis and, once developed, they pose high risk of morbidity. Untrained clinicians may treat these manifestations only at the level of their presentation, leaving the PIDs dangerously undiagnosed. In fact, early diagnosis of PIDs and accompanied gastrointestinal and hepatic complications clearly require appropriate treatment, and in-turn lead to an improved quality of life for the patient.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{functions}} of the liver is the production of bile and the biliary secretion of endogenous and exogenous substances, including drugs and drug metabolites. Bile formation is a complex sequence of cellular events, which involves uptake of bile constituents and xenobiotics on the basolateral (sinusoidal) plasma membrane of hepatocytes and secretion of cholephilic compounds across the apical (canalicular) membrane. These uptake and efflux processes are maintained by distinct transport systems expressed at the two polar surface domains of liver cells. Any functional disturbance of these canalicular transport systems can lead to cholestatic liver disease, which is associated with intracellular accumulation of toxic bile constituents and consecutive cholestatic liver cell damage. Interaction of drugs with <b>hepatobiliary</b> transport <b>systems</b> is increasingly recognized as cause of acquired cholestatic syndromes. Thereby, genetically determined alterations of hepatobiliary transporter functions are important risk factors for an individual's susceptibility to develop cholestasis. Especially, mutations in canalicular transporter genes can cause certain forms of hereditary cholestatic liver disease, including progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis or intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. In addition, systematic genetic screenings have discovered numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms in hepatobiliary transporter genes that lead to amino acid exchanges in the encoded proteins. However, the functional consequences and the clinical relevance of most of these polymorphisms remain to be defined. This overview summarizes the physiological function of human <b>hepatobiliary</b> transport <b>systems</b> and discusses {{the impact of their}} genetic variations for the pathophysiology of cholestatic syndromes and the pharmacogenetics of drug-induced cholestasis...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{estimated}} the biodistribution and radiation-absorbed dose of {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) radio-ligand 11 C-PD 153035 in whole-body PET examinations of healthy volunteers. Methods: Two-dimensional whole-body PET was performed on 9 subjects after injection of 11 C-PD 153035 at 329. 36 77. 8 MBq (mean 6 SD). A total of 12 frames were ac-quired for approximately 90 min in 7 segments of the body. Re-gions of interest were drawn on PET images of source organs. Residence time was calculated as the area under the time– activity curve. Radiation dosimetry was calculated from organ residence time by use of MIRDOSE 3 software. Results: The renal and <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>systems</b> played important roles in 11 C-PD 153035 excretion from the body, accounting for the excretion of approximately 23 % and 19 % of the injected radioactivity, re-spectively. Blood-pool activity was only moderate and declined over time. Tracer accumulation in the lungs, bone marrow, and muscles was slight, resulting in low background activity in the chest. The organs with the highest radiation-absorbed doses were the urinary bladder and the gallbladder; the effective doses were 6. 08 E 202 6 1. 85 E 202 and 2. 40 E 202 6 8. 01 E 203 mGy/ MBq, respectively. The effective dose equivalent was 7. 43 E 203 6 1. 10 E 203 mSv/MBq, and the dose-limiting organ was the uri-nary bladder. Conclusion: On {{the basis of the}} estimated absorbed dose, 11 C-PD 153035 displayed a favorable radiation dose profile in humans and therefore could be used in multiple PET examinations of the same subject per year. 11 C-PD 153035 is a promising ligand for the investigation of EGFR in humans, es-pecially in chest tumors such as non–small cell lung cancer...|$|R
40|$|Following acute {{chemical}} injury, hepatocytes {{are generally}} more resistant to toxicant re-exposure.

40|$|Drug-induced liver {{injury is}} an {{important}} clinical problem with significant morbidity and mortality. Whereas for most hepatocellular forms of drug-induced hepatic injury the underlying pathophysiological mechanism is poorly understood, there is increasing evidence that cholestatic forms of drug-induced liver damage result from a drug- or metabolite-mediated inhibition of <b>hepatobiliary</b> transporter <b>systems.</b> In addition to their key role in determining hepatic drug exposure and clearance, the coordinated action of these transport systems is essential for bile formation and the biliary secretion of cholephilic compounds and xenobiotics. Any drug-mediated functional disturbance of these processes can lead to an intracellular accumulation of potentially harmful bile constituents and result {{in the development of}} cholestatic liver cell damage. In addition to direct drug-mediated inhibition of hepatocellular transport, function of these transporters can be altered by pre-existing hepatic disease and genetic factors, which {{contribute to the development of}} drug-induced cholestasis in susceptible individuals.

40|$|AbstractHepatic uptake and biliary {{excretion}} of organic anions (e. g., bile acids and bilirubin) is mediated by <b>hepatobiliary</b> transport <b>systems.</b> Defects in transporter expression and function can cause or maintain cholestasis and jaundice. Recruitment of alternative export transporters {{in coordination with}} phase I and II detoxifying pathways provides alternative pathways to counteract accumulation of potentially toxic biliary constituents in cholestasis. The genes encoding for organic anion uptake (NTCP, OATPs), canalicular export (BSEP, MRP 2) and alternative basolateral export (MRP 3, MRP 4) in liver are regulated by a complex interacting network of hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF 1, 3, 4) and nuclear (orphan) receptors (e. g., FXR, PXR, CAR, RAR, LRH- 1, SHP, GR). Bile acids, proinflammatory cytokines, hormones and drugs mediate causative and adaptive transporter changes at a transcriptional level by interacting with these nuclear factors and receptors. Unraveling the underlying regulatory mechanisms may therefore not only allow {{a better understanding of}} the molecular pathophysiology of cholestatic liver diseases but should also identify potential pharmacological strategies targeting these regulatory networks. This review is focused on general principles of transcriptional basolateral and canalicular transporter regulation in inflammation-induced cholestasis, ethinylestradiol- and pregnancy-associated cholestasis, obstructive cholestasis and liver regeneration. Moreover, the potential therapeutic role of nuclear receptor agonists for the management of liver diseases is highlighted...|$|R
