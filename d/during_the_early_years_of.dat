Originally, the producers were ordered to produce four clip show per season in order to meet episode limits imposed by the network. Fox network officials reasoned that clip shows could be produced at half the cost of a normal episode, but syndication rights could be sold at full price. The staff, however, felt such a large number of clip shows would alienate fans of the series.|$|E

5|$|Ecclesiastical {{jurisdiction}} over the inhabitants was equally chaotic; it was first placed under the Diocese of Tlaxcala but {{was transferred to the}} Diocese of Guatemala in 1536.

In 1545 it became a part of the Diocese of Chiapa. It was returned to Guatemala in 1561, and back to Chiapa in 1596.|$|E
5|$|St Briavels Castle {{remained}} an important {{location in the}} reign of Edward II, as the Welsh Marches were a key region in the wars between the king, his favourites and various noble factions during the period. Roger d'Amory was the constable of the castle <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> Edward's reign. D'Amory was a royal favourite and Edward II visited the Castle several times, with an extensive renovation of the rooms and quarters occurring during this time.

5|$|Substantial {{alterations}} {{appear to}} have taken place <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> Samuel Egerton's ownership in the mid-18th century. The canopy at the dais end of the Great Hall was destroyed– although part of it can still be seen in the north wall– when a floor was inserted and new rooms were formed with lath and plaster partitions. The east wing of the hall was probably demolished at about the same time, but certainly before 1812, the date of the earliest estate map.|$|E

5|$|The Elves {{view the}} sexual act as {{extremely}} special and intimate, for {{it leads to}} the conception and birth of children. Extra-marital and premarital sex are unthinkable, adultery is also unheard of and fidelity between spouses is absolute. Yet separation during pregnancy or <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> parenthood (caused by war, for example) is so grievous to the couple that they prefer to have children in peaceful times. Living Elves cannot be raped or forced to have sex; before that they will lose the will to endure and go to Mandos.|$|E
5|$|The IJN's faulty anti-submarine {{doctrine}} {{also contributed}} to Japan's shipping losses. The Navy had placed a low priority on protecting merchant shipping from submarine attack before and <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the war and convoys were not routinely assembled until 1943. The Grand Escort Headquarters was formed in late 1943 to coordinate convoys and implement a standard doctrine. The Escort-of-Convoy headquarters was also established in April 1944 to provide a pool of senior commanders who were available to command convoys, though none had any experience with convoy operations or anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
5|$|The Underground Group's {{ownership}} of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the Group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways.
