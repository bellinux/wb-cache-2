40|$|This essay {{examines}} <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> antiquities in {{the context}} of the history of early modern scientific illustration. The role of illustrations in the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> archaeology as a discipline is assessed, and the emergence of a graphic style for representing artifacts is shown to be closely connected to the development of scientific illustration in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. The essay argues that the production <b>of</b> conventionalized <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> antiquities during this period represents a fundamental shift in the approach to ancient material culture, signifying the recognition of objects as evidence. As has been demonstrated in other scientific fields, the creation of a visual system for recording objects was central to the acceptance of artifacts as “data” that could be organized into groups, classified as types, and analyzed to gain knowledge of the past...|$|R
