40|$|Abstract — We present {{exploration}} and mapping strategies for a mobile robot moving among a finite collection of convex obstacles in the plane. The obstacles are {{unknown to the}} robot, which does {{not have access to}} coordinates and cannot measure distances or angles. The robot has a unique sensor, called the <b>gap</b> <b>sensor,</b> that tracks the direction of the depth discontinuities in the robot’s visibility region. Furthermore, the robot can only move towards depth discontinuities. As the robot moves, the depth discontinuities split and merge, and these changes are encoded in a Gap Navigation Tree. We present a strategy for this robot that is guaranteed to explore the whole environment, but that cannot decide whether the exploration has been completed. If in addition it is assumed that the robot has access to a pebble, which is an identifiable point that the robot can manipulate, then we prove that the robot can decide (in polynomial time in the number of obstacles) whether the environment has been completely explored. For this, the robot is able to distinguish every obstacle using only the <b>gap</b> <b>sensor</b> and a single pebble. These results are a continuation of our previous work on gap sensing for multiply connected environments [24], in which we reduce the sensing requirements for the robot by constraining the shape of the obstacles.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development, calibration, {{and testing of}} the adaptive optics system for the 6. 5 m Multiple Mirror Telescope. By employing a deformable secondary mirror, the MMT adaptive optics system uniquely solves several problems typical of astronomical adaptive optics systems. Extra components are eliminated, improving throughput and reducing emissivity. Since the adaptive secondary is integral to the telescope, a corrected beam is presented to any instrument mounted at Cassegrain focus. The testing of an adaptive mirror, which is large and convex, poses a new and difficult problem. I present a test apparatus that allows complete calibration and operation, in closed-loop, of the entire adaptive optics system in the laboratory. The test apparatus replicates the optical path of the telescope with a wavefront error of less than 500 nm RMS. To simulate atmospheric turbulence, machined acrylic plates are included. A phase-shifting interferometer allows calibration of the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor and reconstruction algorithms; comparisons agree to one-third of the root-mean-square wavefront. First, techniques were developed to align the apparatus and measure residual aberration. Then, the wavefront sensor was calibrated by measuring its response to introduced tilt. Lastly, a Fourier wave-optics approach was used to produce a modal wavefront reconstructor. The adaptive secondary mirror uses electro-magnetic force actuators. Capacitive position sensors are placed at each actuator to permit control of the mirror shape without measuring the reflected wavefront. These sensors have nanometer resolution, but require calibration. To calibrate the sensors, I developed a small optical instrument which measures the thickness of transparent films to an absolute accuracy of 5 nm with a precision of 2 nm. The device has applications far {{beyond the scope of}} this research. Twenty-four of these optical <b>gap</b> <b>sensors</b> have been built to calibrate the 336 capacitive sensors on the adaptive secondary mirror.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this program is to develop sensors that allow condition based monitoring of critical combustion parts of gas turbines. Siemens teamed with innovative, small companies that were developing sensor concepts that could monitor wearing and cracking of hot turbine parts. A magnetic crack monitoring sensor concept developed by JENTEK Sensors, Inc. was evaluated in laboratory tests. Designs for engine application were evaluated. The inability to develop a robust lead wire to transmit the signal long distances resulted in a discontinuation of this concept. An optical wear sensor concept proposed by K Sciences GP, LLC was tested in proof-of concept testing. The sensor concept depended, however, on optical fiber tips wearing with the loaded part. The fiber tip wear resulted in too much optical input variability; the sensor could not provide adequate stability for measurement. Siemens developed an alternative optical wear sensor approach that used a commercial PHILTEC, Inc. optical <b>gap</b> <b>sensor</b> with an optical spacer to remove fibers from the wearing surface. The <b>gap</b> <b>sensor</b> measured {{the length of the}} wearing spacer to follow loaded part wear. This optical wear sensor was developed to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5. It was validated in lab tests and installed on a floating transition seal in an F-Class gas turbine. Laboratory tests indicate that the concept can measure wear on loaded parts at temperatures up to 800 {degrees}C with uncertainty of < 0. 3 mm. Testing in an F-Class engine installation showed that the optical spacer wore with the wearing part. The electro-optics box located outside the engine enclosure survived the engine enclosure environment. The fiber optic cable and the optical spacer, however, both degraded after about 100 operating hours, impacting the signal analysis...|$|E

It also facilitates tension-tension fatigue experiments under a variety of mean stress conditions at cyclic loading frequencies to 20 Hz. The sample processes involve fabrication of a supporting frame with springs and alignment beams all made of electroplated nickel.

40|$|A {{unique set of}} {{vibration}} sensors {{was designed}} that incorporate the fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FFPI) and permanent magnets. Feasibility of the design and its advantages over traditional sensors were verified by experiments. The new sensors consist of one that monitors the motion of a body across an air gap with the other designed {{to respond to the}} motion while in contact with the vibrating body. The FFPI is the device used to transmit the vibrational response while permanent magnets are used to transfer the vibratory motion to the FFPI. In the non-contacting sensor, a permanent magnet was used as the motive to transfer the vibratory motion to be registered at the FFPI. Although the magnet resulted in a non-linear response, the effect of the non-linearity can be removed by signal processing. The fiber optic <b>gap</b> <b>sensor</b> (FOGS) developed has a sensitivity of 250 mV/mil for a 30 mil gap to 50 mV/mil for a 65 mil gap and a dynamic range up to 820 Hz. An advantage of the FOGS over traditional eddy current based gap sensors (ECP), for measuring rotor vibration, was demonstrated with a test rotor face that had brass strips attached to it. The FOGS response was not affected by the strips whereas the response of the traditional ECP was greatly affected by the strips. This demonstrated the potential of the FOGS for measuring the motion of a coated shaft. The fiber optic vibration sensor (FOVS) had a marginal response as its construction led to spurious signals. The feasibility of it to act as a vibration sensor, however, was demonstrated. Due to problems in maintaining the proper gap between the proof mass and sensor head during assembly the natural frequency of the FOVS was around 31 Hz and not the targeted 10 Hz. The sensors presented were meant to be a first generation. However, access to additional FFPI elements was restricted limiting further development. Improvements to the sensors would be to modify the sensing head, magnet size, and the embedment of the FFPI as well as to employ tighter machining precision and assembly practices...|$|E

The proof mass, used as the seismic detection components for gyroscopes, is levitated by the presented micro-coil actuator so that the concerns that mechanical fatigue, asymmetry and misalignments, which are inevitably present in the traditional mechanical springs design, can be ruled out. In addition, the limited range of dual-axis motion of the proof mass is completely relaxed and therefore the resolution and sensitivity of the gyroscope can be greatly upgraded.
