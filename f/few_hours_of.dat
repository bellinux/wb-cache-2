5|$|Although Howe {{was in a}} {{favourable}} position, Villaret had {{not been}} idle during the night. He had attempted, with near success, to distance his ships from the British fleet; when dawn broke at 05:00 he was within a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> gaining enough wind to escape over the horizon. Allowing his men to breakfast, Howe took full advantage of {{his position on the}} weather gage to close with Villaret, and by 08:12 the British fleet was just four miles (6km) from the enemy. By this time, Howe's formation was strung out in an organised line parallel to the French, with frigates acting as repeaters for the admiral's commands. The French were likewise in line ahead and the two lines began exchanging long-range gunfire at 09:24, whereupon Howe unleashed his innovative battleplan.|$|E
5|$|Capybara {{gestation}} is 130–150 days, {{and produces}} {{a litter of}} four capybara young on average, but may produce between one and eight in a single litter. Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group within a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group {{as soon as they}} are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group. Alloparenting has been observed in this species. Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in Mato Grosso, Brazil.|$|E

40|$|This article helps {{integrate}} {{research on}} work hours and work–family issues by examining how work–family conflict {{is related to}} the desire for more and <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> work. Using the first wave of the Household Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia survey, we find that work-to-family conflict is associ-ated with a desire for <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> work. Family-to-work conflict, however, is only weakly associated with desired work hour changes, and we find some evidence that it makes women want to increase the number <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> they work. We also find evidence of moderating effects: Work-to-family conflict is more likely to make women want <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> when they have preschool children. We conclude that many working parents see work hour reductions as a way to cope with work–family conflict but that people prefer different coping strate-gies depending on their gender and family situation...|$|R

Finally, the fury of the attack subsided enough to permit some communication between the former French Guards, who formed the professional core of Lafayette's National Guard militia, and the royal gardes du corps. The units had a history of cooperation and a military sense of mutual respect, and Lafayette, who had been snatching a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> sleep in his exhaustion, awoke {{to make the most of}} it.

5|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} supportive; gastric {{decontamination}} with activated charcoal {{may be beneficial}} if medical attention is sought within a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.|$|E

5|$|Operation Plunder {{began at}} 21:00 on 23 March after a week-long aerial {{bombardment}} of Luftwaffe airfields and the German transport system, involving {{more than ten}} thousand Allied aircraft. By {{the early hours of}} 24 March units of 21st Army Group had crossed the Rhine against heavy German opposition and secured several crossings on the eastern bank of the river. In the first <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> 24 March, the transport aircraft carrying the two airborne divisions that formed Operation Varsity took off from airbases in England and France and rendezvoused over Brussels, before turning north-east for the Rhine dropping zones. The airlift consisted of 541 transport aircraft containing airborne troops, and a further 1,050 troop-carriers towing 1,350 gliders. The 17th Airborne Division consisted of 9,387 personnel, who were transported in 836 C-47 Dakota transports, 72 C-46 Commando transports, and more than 900 Waco CG-4A gliders. At 10:00 {{on the morning of the}} 24th, the first Allied airborne units began to land on German soil on the eastern bank of the Rhine, some thirteen hours after the Allied assault had begun.|$|E

5|$|The first clashes {{took place}} at 6:30 when French tank {{divisions}} stormed the central position of the Syrian defensive line while French cavalry and infantry units assaulted the Syrians' northern and southern positions. The camel cavalry were the first Syrian units to engage the French. Syrian forces initially put up stiff resistance along the front, but lacked coordination between their different units. Early in the clashes, Syrian artillery fire inflicted casualties on a battery of French soldiers. French tanks faced heavy fire as they attempted to gain ground against the Syrians. However, French artillery took a toll on Syrian forces and by 8:30 the French had broken the Syrians' central trench. At {{one point in the}} first <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the clashes, Syrian forces managed to briefly pin down two Senegalese companies that were relatively isolated on the French right flank.

5|$|Operation Varsity was a {{successful}} large-scale airborne operation. All of the objectives that the airborne troops of the 17th had been tasked with had been captured and held, usually within only a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the operation's beginning. The bridges over the Issel had been successfully captured, although one later had to be destroyed to prevent its capture by counter-attacking German forces. The Diersfordter Forest had been cleared of enemy troops, and the roads along which the Germans might have moved reinforcements against the advance had been cut by airborne troops. By nightfall of the 24th, the British 15th Infantry Division had joined up with elements of the British 6th Airborne Division, and by midnight the first light bridge was across the Rhine. By the 27th, twelve bridges suitable for heavy armour had been installed over the Rhine and the Allies had fourteen divisions on the east {{bank of the river}} which had penetrated up to ten miles. The division also gained its fourth Medal of Honor in the days following Operation Varsity, when Technical Sergeant Clinton Hedrick of the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment received the award posthumously after aiding in the capture of Lembeck Castle, which had been turned into a fortified position by the Germans. In terms of casualties, the 17th Airborne Division suffered a total of 1,346 casualties in the space of five days, between 24 and 29 March, when Operation Plunder came to an end. After it had participated in Operation Varsity, the 17th Airborne Division continued to advance through Germany as a part of XVIII Airborne Corps, engaging German forces around Wesel, Essen and Münster. When Germany unconditionally surrendered on 7 May 1945, the division was conducting occupation duties in northern Germany.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Lone Pine (also {{known as}} the Battle of Kanlı Sırt) was fought between Australian and Ottoman Empire forces during the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War, between 6 and 10 August 1915. The battle {{was part of a}} diversionary attack to draw Ottoman {{attention}} away from the main assaults against Sari Bair, Chunuk Bair and Hill 971, which became {{known as the}} August Offensive. The Australians, initially at brigade strength, managed to capture the main Ottoman trench line from the battalion that was defending the position in the first <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the fighting; however, the fighting continued for the next three days as the Ottomans brought up reinforcements and launched numerous counterattacks in an attempt to recapture the ground they had lost.

However, Manuel was {{embedded within a}} broad weather system that extended from the eastern Pacific across Mexico, which included Hurricane Ingrid in the Bay of Campeche on the Gulf of Mexico coast. The broad system, including Manuel, moved generally northward. By early on September15, Manuel had developed a central dense overcast, with a 17mi (28km) wide eye in the center. Based on the structure and satellite-intensity estimates, the NHC estimated Manuel attained secondary peak winds of , just shy of hurricane status. The agency noted the potential for further strengthening into a hurricane, citing the warm waters, moist environment, and low shear. A break in the subtropical ridge to the north allowed the storm to initially continue generally to the north-northeast, but after attaining its secondary peak, Manuel {{turned back to the}} northwest while accelerating. On September15, Manuel made landfall near Aquila in Michoacán as a high-end tropical storm, though operationally, it was believed to have moved ashore near Manzanillo in Colima.
