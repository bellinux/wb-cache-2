5000|$|Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT) - SCAT is {{an active}} {{microwave}} device designed and developed at ISRO/SAC, Ahmedabad. It {{will be used to}} determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer {{is an active}} microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 50 x 50 km. It consists of a parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter which is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. It is an improved version of the one on Oceansat-1. The <b>inner</b> <b>beam</b> makes an incidence angle of 48.90° and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.60° on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for <b>inner</b> <b>beam</b> and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{continue}} {{investigations of the}} Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of stratified jets. We first generalize our previous analytical results by taking into consideration relativistic motion and relativistic equation of states for the three components namely the <b>inner</b> <b>beam,</b> the sheet or envelope and the ambient medium, and derive the dispersion relation for the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The ultrarelativistic limit of paper I {{as well as the}} nonrelativistic limit for both the equations of state and the jet bulk speed can be deduced. Exploring a wider range of parameters, we find evidence for two main types of instability modes, with mode crossing and interaction between modes. These two modes correspond to the excitation of sound waves in the beam and in the envelope which can both act as a resonant wave guide. As a result, the addition of an <b>inner</b> <b>beam</b> inside a jet can strongly enhance the linear growth of its Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The stratified jet scenario appears quite relevant to give account for the complex morphology and velocity fields now observed in a few jets such as in M 87, where various layers with respect to the jet axis are clearly visible.

A calibration procedure to determine high resolution, three dimensional transmit and receive beam patterns of a Reson SeaBat 7125 MBES was performed using the fresh water calibration tank at the University of New Hampshire. The measurements employed an omni-directional Reson TC 4034 projector/hydrophone as a reference transducer at an acoustic distance of 13 m. The multibeam sonar system was configured for 256 beams equi-angle mode and operating frequency of 396 kHz. The transmit beam pattern was computed for across-track angular range between +/– 90 o in 0. 1 o increments and along-track angular range between +/– 2. 55 o in 0. 09 o increments. Receive directional characteristics were measured for the across-track range of +/– 120 o in 0. 1 o increments with along-track angular range of +/– 1. 23 o in 0. 18 o increments. With these measurements, a three-dimensional plot of the transmit beam pattern was computed for {{the entire range of}} angles, although for the receive beam pattern it was only determined for the 0 o along-track angle. The reduced angular coverage of the receive beam pattern was due to discrepancies in the off-axis results that are thought to be related to receiver saturation. Measurements for the transmit beam pattern show a – 3 dB beamwidth of 0. 99 o for across-track angle of 0 o with side lobes below – 17 dB. The results show an unexplained curvature in the transmit beam pattern that would have gone un-noticed during a two dimensional beam pattern measurement. An interference effect causing ripples and attenuation of the transmit beam pattern was also observed. This effect is thought to be caused by a second 200 kHz projector mounted parallel to the 396 kHz projector. This interference occurs at an across-track angular region between + 30 o and + 75 o with gradual decrease in amplitude of about 3 dB. The receive beam pattern measurements show a – 3 dB beamwidth of approximately 0. 62 o for the most <b>inner</b> <b>beams</b> (beams 128 and 129) and of approximately 1. 40 o for the most outer beams (beams 1 and 256) at along-track angular position of 0 o with side-lobes below – 26 dB for the most <b>inner</b> <b>beams</b> and below – 17 dB for the most outer beams...|$|R

Early inspections showed signs of elongation of the bridge, but the cause for the elongation and expansion was not recognized at that point. The Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR) that causes the expansion was not known at the time of construction. This thesis will present the theory of how the structure is affected. The structure is analysed both statically and theoretically, due to the expanding chemical reaction. The expansive reaction is due to a reaction between the aggregate and the cement in the concrete mix- It causes stresses to occur in places the structure was not designed for. The thesis will consider mainly the two large vertical cracks, which are explained in the report from field inspections in 2012 by Aas-Jakobsen. Eurocodes and Handbooks from the Norwegian Public Road Administration (SVV) are the basis during calculation of the loads and capacities. The bridge is 200 metres long, and is supported by eight column rows that are anchored in the foundations under the water surface of the river.

A flat-top laser pulse with 3  ns duration and up to 92. 73  kJ energy is used.

The trembling of thin jets explains naturally the observed erratic multi-explosive structure of different GRBs.

In {{the case of}} steady flow, both buckling and flutter instabilities are investigated. In the case of pulsatile flow, we compute the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix derived from the discretized linear system with periodic coefficients, and deduce the dynamical stability information. In addition, for a special case, in which the concentric pipes have the same length, we compare the dynamic stability results with the corresponding solutions obtained with the Bolotin method. y Assistant Professor, Institute of Paper Science and Technology, Atlanta, GA 30318 z Professor, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL 60115 Submitted to: Journal of Fluid [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{built an}} analytical source model for GPU-based MC dose engine. In this paper, {{we present a}} sampling strategy to efficiently utilize this source model in GPU-based dose calculation. Our source model {{was based on a}} concept of phase-space-ring (PSR). This ring structure makes it effective to account for beam rotational symmetry, but not suitable for dose calculations due to rectangular jaw settings. Hence, we first convert PSR source model to its phase-space let (PSL) representation. Then in dose calculation, different types of sub-sources were separately sampled. Source sampling and particle transport were iterated. So that the particles being sampled and transported simultaneously are of same type and close in energy to alleviate GPU thread divergence. We also present an automatic commissioning approach to adjust the model for a good representation of a clinical linear accelerator. Weighting factors were introduced to adjust relative weights of PSRs, determined by solving a quadratic minimization problem with a non-negativity constraint. We tested the efficiency gain of our model over a previous source model using PSL files. The efficiency was improved by 1. 70 ~ 4. 41, due to the avoidance of long data reading and transferring. The commissioning problem can be solved in ~ 20 sec. Its efficacy was tested by comparing the doses computed using the commissioned model and the uncommissioned one, with measurements in different open fields in a water phantom under a clinical Varian Truebeam 6 MV beam. For the depth dose curves, the average distance-to-agreement was improved from 0. 04 ~ 0. 28 cm to 0. 04 ~ 0. 12 cm for build-up region and the root-mean-square (RMS) dose difference after build-up region was reduced from 0. 32 %~ 0. 67 % to 0. 21 %~ 0. 48 %. For lateral dose profiles, RMS difference was reduced from 0. 31 %~ 2. 0 % to 0. 06 %~ 0. 78 % at <b>inner</b> <b>beam</b> and from 0. 20 %~ 1. 25 % to 0. 10 %~ 0. 51 % at outer beam.

40|$|A {{study of}} the laser-plasma {{interaction}} processes have been performed in plasmas that are created to emulate the plasma conditions in indirect drive inertial confinement fusion targets. The plasma emulator is produced in a gas-filled hohlraum; a blue 351 -nm laser beam propagates along the axis of the hohlraum interacting with a high-temperature (T{sub e} = 3. 5 keV), dense (n{sub e} = 5 x 10 {sup 20 }cm{sup - 3 }), long-scale length (L {approx} 2 mm) plasma. Experiments at these conditions have demonstrated that the interaction beam produces less than 1 % total backscatter resulting in transmission greater than 90 % for laser intensities less than I 2. 5 keV) high-density (n{sub e} = 5 x 10 {sup 20 } w-cm{sup - 3 }) plasma. Comparing the experimental results with detailed gain calculations for the onset of significant laser scattering processes shows a stimulated Brillouin scattering threshold (R= 10 %) for a linear gain of 15; these high temperature, low density experiments produce plasma conditions comparable to those along the outer beams in ignition hohlraum designs. By increasing the gas fill density (n{sub e} = 10 {sup 21 } cm{sup - 3 }) in these targets, the <b>inner</b> <b>beam</b> ignition hohlraum conditions are accessed. In this case, stimulated Raman scattering dominates the backscattering processes and we show that scattering is small for gains less than 20 which can be achieved through proper choice of the laser beam intensity. The first three-dimensional (3 D) simulations of a high power 0. 351 {micro}m laser beam propagating through a high-temperature hohlraum plasma are also reported. We show that 3 D linear kinetic modeling of Stimulated Brillouin scattering reproduces quantitatively the experimental measurements, provided it is coupled to detailed hydrodynamics simulation and a realistic description of the laser beam from its millimeter-size envelop down to the micron scale speckles. These simulations accurately predict the strong reduction of SBS measured when polarization smoothing is used...|$|E
40|$|Statocyst is the {{balancing}} and sensing {{organ of the}} cephalopods (octopus, squid and cuttlefish). Previous studies have shown the macula/statolith part of the statocyst is the linear acceleration sensing system of the water particle motion. Although a few differences primarily in gross morphology exist, the macula/statolith part of the statocyst shows a striking number of similarities in structure and function among different cephalopods. In this study, the macula/statolith part of the statocyst is investigated by means of mechanics method. Specifically, based on the geometry and material property of macula/statolith from three cephalopod species (Octopus vulgaris, Sepia officinalis and Loligo vulgaris), a second order dynamic oscillator model was used to simulate its frequency response to the water particle motion. The acceleration detection threshold spectra comparison between the modeling analysis and the experiment data verifies that the cephalopods {{are sensitive to the}} water particle motion (acceleration) in the low (infrasound) frequency range. As an integral part of this research, the characteristics of kinocilia bundle which is the mechanoreceptive part of macula/statolith are also studied by interpreting the interaction between kinocilia bundle and statolith in a fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) numerical model. A parametric study of the kinocilia/statolith numerical model is conducted to improve the understanding of the sensing mechanism of the kinocilia bundle interaction with the statolith. Inspired by this interaction phenomenon, a bio-inspired vibration sensor and a bio-inspired isolation element are conceptually developed and numerically studied. The numerical simulation result implies that the frequency response behavior observed in the kinocilia bundle model from FSI analysis is also seen in both engineering designs, and this behavior could be equivalently described by the Maxwell model and SLS model for these two designs, respectively. Lastly, by taking advantage of 3 D printing technology, a prototype bio-inspired vibration sensor was fabricated in the lab and subsequently tested to characterize its sensing behavior. A comparison between the experimental data and predictions from a theoretical model suggests that the frequency response of the bio-inspired sensor design is equivalent to the convolution of the frequency response of a 2 nd-order oscillator and the sensor's <b>inner</b> <b>beam.</b> This unique feature enables the development of two potential motion sensor designs (jerk sensor and velocity sensor) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at nominal beam parameters is expected for the next years. Increased synchrotron-radiation stimulated-desorption and electron-cloud build-up are expected. A deep understanding of the interactions between the proton beams and the beam pipe wall is mandatory to control the anticipated beam-induced pressure rise.

40|$|The use of multibeam echo {{sounders}} (MBES) {{has grown}} more frequent in applications like seafloor imaging, fisheries, and habitat mapping. Calibration of these instruments {{is important for}} understanding and validating the performance of MBES. For echo sounders in general, different calibration methodologies have been developed in controlled environments such as a fresh water tank and in the actual field of operation. While calibration in an indoor tank facility can bring excellent results in terms of accuracy, {{the amount of time}} required for a complete calibration can become prohibitively large. A field calibration can reveal the actual radiation beam pattern for shipmounted sonar systems, accounting for acoustic interferences which may be caused by objects around the installed transducers. The standard target method is a common practice for field calibration of split-beam echo sounders. However, when applied to a Mills Cross MBES, this method does not provide means to determine the alongship angle of the target, since the receiver transducer is a line array. A method to determine the combined transmit/receive radiation beam pattern for a ship-mounted multibeam system was developed and tested for a Reson Seabat 7125 MBES inside the fresh water calibration tank of the University of New Hampshire. This calibration methodology employs a tungsten carbide sphere of 38. 1 mm diameter as target and a Simrad EK 60 split-beam sonar system to provide athwartship and alongship angular information of the target sphere position. The multibeam sonar system was configured for 256 beams equi-angle mode at an operating frequency of 200 kHz; the split-beam system was set to work passively at the same frequency. A combined transmit/receive beam pattern was computed for an athwartship angular range between – 6 o and + 6 o and an alongship angular range between – 1 o and + 3 o. The limited angular range of the measurements is due to the – 3 dB beamwidth of 7. 1 o in the athwartship and alongship directions of the split-beam sonar system coupled with the alongship offset of 1. 6 o between the maximum response axes (MRA) of the two sonar systems. Possible acoustic interferences caused by the monofilament line used to suspend the target sphere in the water column were found in the measurements for alongship angle values less than – 1 o. Beam pattern measurements for the combined transmit/receive beam pattern at a distance of 8 m show a – 3 dB beamwidth of 1. 1 o in the athwartship direction and a – 3 dB beamwidth of 2. 0 o in the alongship direction for the most <b>inner</b> <b>beams.</b> The dynamic range for the measurements was approximately of – 40 dB...|$|R
