2500|$|Other {{features}} {{may include}} a <b>heated</b> <b>seat,</b> {{which may be}} adjustable from 30°C to 40°C; an automatic lid equipped with a proximity sensor, which opens and closes based on {{the location of the}} user. Some play music to relax the user's sphincter [...] (some Inax toilets, for example, play the first few phrases of Op. 62 Nr. 6 Frühlingslied by Felix Mendelssohn). Other features are automatic flushing, automatic air deodorizing, and a germ-resistant surface. Some models specially designed for the elderly may include armrests and devices that help the user to stand back up after use. A soft close feature slows the toilet lid down while closing so the lid does not slam onto the seat, or in some models, the toilet lid will close automatically a certain time after flushing. The most recent introduction is the ozone deodorant system that can quickly eliminate smells. Also, the latest models store the times when the toilet is used and have a power-saving mode that warms the toilet seat only during times when the toilet is likely to be used based on historic usage patterns. Some toilets also glow in the dark or may even have air conditioning below the rim for hot summer days. Another recent innovation is intelligent sensors that detect someone {{standing in front of the}} toilet and initiate an automatic raising of the lid (if the person is facing away from the toilet) or the lid and seat together (if someone is facing the toilet).|$|E

50|$|Brondell's Swash 1000 {{features}} an automatically activated carbon deodorizer which can suck {{the air from}} the toilet bowl and blow it through a catalyst wall of activated charcoal that absorbs odours. By pressing the deodorize button, it will run on high for approximately 1 minute. Besides the deodorize function, the Swash 1000 also has features that are common among electronic bidets, such as posterior wash, feminine wash, self-cleaning nozzle, nozzle position adjustment, adjustable water pressure, water and drying temperature setting, oscillating setting, <b>heated</b> <b>seat</b> and others.|$|E
50|$|High-tech {{toilet seats}} may include many features, {{including}} a <b>heated</b> <b>seat,</b> a bidet, and a blow drier. High-tech seats are {{most common in}} Japan, where a seat with integrated bidets is colloquially called a Washlet, after a leading brand. Electrically heated toilet seats have been popular in Japan since the 1970s. Since Japanese bathrooms are often unheated, the toilet seat sometimes doubles as a space heater. Integrated bidets date from around 1980, and have since become very popular in Japan, and are becoming more common in most other developed countries.|$|E

40|$|In present {{lavatory}} in Japan, {{the following}} are being tried {{for the purpose of}} further improvement in the amenity: washable seat, <b>heated</b> <b>seat,</b> deodorization with function stool. In this study, the examination was carried out on the usefulness of the local ventilation system using CFD analysis method on the assumption of the lavatory in office building. In the analysis, it is examined by changing the volumetric exhaust flow rate on ceiling ventilation, local ventilation and ceiling and local ventilation combined use. On each case, it is examined by changing air ventilation balance and outlet position. The result showed that the local ventilation could reduce the indoor pollutant quality concentration in comparison with the ceiling ventilation at little ventilation air volume. And, it was shown that diffusion range of the pollutant to the near human head was reduced...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} presents mathematical {{and experimental}} models {{developed for the}} prediction of thermal interactions of an automobile passenger with the cabin environment and a ventilated seat. The mathematical model developed in this work employs existing and modified human-body heat balance equations along with variable thermo-physical environmental conditions. The model predicts steady-state and transient variations of passenger skin and seat-surface temperatures with time before and after activating the seat ventilation system for the given and selected cabin air conditions and <b>heated</b> <b>seat</b> temperature. In calculating the temperature changes with time after activating the ventilated-seat system, the modified heat balance equation along with the numerical analysis using the CFD package (Fluent, v. 6) has been iteratively used, in which appropriate air-side average heat transfer coefficients were determined by using the Reynolds and Nusselt analogies for various system operating conditions. An experimental chamber was built to simulate the vehicle air and seat conditions attainable during a hot summer day. A selected number of individuals {{have participated in the}} experiments. Passengers’ skin and seat-surface temperatures were measured with time after activating the ventilated-seat system for various chamber conditions. Investigation of the results obtained from the mathematical model and the experimental work showed that the seat ventilation system proposed in this work is able to provide passenger thermal comfort within a short time after activating the seat ventilation system. Detailed experimental works have been done to quantify the passengers’ thermal responses along with various chamber conditions for objective view point. Human subjective tests were done and statistically analyzed to support experimental works for subjective view point...|$|E
