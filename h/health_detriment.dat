40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy Manual DOE M 435. 1 - 1, “Radioactive Waste Management Manual,” {{requires}} that performance assessments demonstrate that releases of radionuclides {{to the environment}} are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). Quantitative cost benefit analysis of radiation protection options is one component of the ALARA process. This report summarizes a quantitative cost benefit analysis of closure cover thickness for the Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Site (RWMS) on the Nevada Test Site. The optimum cover thickness that maintains doses ALARA is shown to be the thickness with the minimum total closure cost. Total closure cost {{is the sum of}} cover construction cost and the <b>health</b> <b>detriment</b> cost. Cover construction cost is estimated based on detailed cost estimates for closure of the 92 -acre Low-Level Waste Management Unit (LLWMU). The <b>health</b> <b>detriment</b> cost is calculated as the product of collective dose and a constant monetary value of <b>health</b> <b>detriment</b> in units of dollars per unit collective dose. Collective dose is the sum of all individual doses in an exposed population and has units of person-sievert (Sv). Five discrete cover thickness options ranging from 2. 5 to 4. 5 meters (m) (8. 2 to 15 feet [ft]) are evaluated. The optimization was subject to the constraints that (1) options must meet all applicable regulatory requirements and that (2) individual doses be a small fraction of background radiation dose. Total closure cost is found to be a monotonically increasing function of cover thickness for the 92 -ac LLWMU, the Northern Expansion Area, and the entire Area 5 RWMS. The cover construction cost is orders of magnitude greater than the <b>health</b> <b>detriment</b> cost. Two-thousand Latin hypercube sampling realizations of the relationship between total closure cost and cover thickness are generated. In every realization, the optimum cover thickness is 2. 5 m (8. 2 ft) for the 92 -ac Low-Level Waste Management Unit, the Northern Expansion Area, and the entire Area 5 RWMS. The conclusions of the optimization are found to be insensitive to all input parameters, the monetary value of the <b>health</b> <b>detriment</b> over a range of values from $ 200, 000 to $ 15, 000, 000 per person-Sv, and the period of integration of collective dose.

Most have shown no significant changes due to fields, however, in some pilot studies significant changes were revealed, but in most cases these were not replicated in follow-up studies. This highlights a feature of this research area, generally; the unambiguous identification of small changes in noisy data where the understanding of possible interaction mechanisms is lacking.

This {{study sought to}} explore self-compassion as a psychological resource in the self-stigma process. Methods: In a 2012 representative German population survey of N = 1, 158 {{overweight and}} obese individuals, self-compassion was examined as a mediator between self-stigma and {{mental and physical health}} outcomes, including BMI (kg/m 2), using structural equation modeling and controlling for sociodemographic factors. Results: Psychological variables were assessed using validated self-report questionnaires. Self-compassion partially mediated the relationships between self-stigma and depression, somatic symptoms, and health status / quality of life, lowering the predictive effect of self-stigma on the outcomes by approximately one-third. In contrast, self-compassion, because it was unrelated to BMI, did not mediate the association between self-stigma and BMI. Conclusion: Self-compassion has the potential to act as a buffer against the mental and global <b>health</b> <b>detriments</b> of self-stigma in overweight and obesity and could thus represent a target for interventions to reduce self-stigma and prevent these health impairments. In order to influence the association between self-stigma and BMI, self-compassion should conceptually be linked to weight management...|$|R

In organic pig production, respiratory diseases and lameness have been cited as the most common <b>health</b> <b>detriments,</b> and depending on the location, a lesser prevalence exists conventional production. Since antibiotics {{are not allowed to}} maintain the organic integrity of an animal, some producers will forgo antibiotics altogether, even with sick animals occurring in the system. However, according to USDA-NOP Guidelines, antibiotics and other treatments that no longer make the animal organic are required to maintain overall herd health. The use of antibiotics in herds with organic fattening pigs is lower compared to herds with conventional pigs. This is probably a result of the alternative system leading to a lower infection level, since no difference in mortality pigs could be discovered. As a large percentage of organic pork production systems are pasture-based, or not living on concrete, a degree of risk is present from soil based pathogenic exposure. There are options for producers, including organically approved bio-control agents, diatomaceous earth (DE), and acidified grain rations, among others. However, many of these contain anecdotal evidence only, and the study on pasture rotation to control parasitic infections is largely unknown and research is required.|$|R

Analysis of 212 first draw drinking water samples shows that almost 100 % and 56 % of samples contain detectable concentrations of copper and lead, respectively. Of these detectable concentrations, copper exceeds Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (ADWG) in 5 % of samples and lead in 8 %. By contrast, no samples contained arsenic and manganese water concentrations {{in excess of}} the ADWG. Analysis of household plumbing fittings (taps and connecting pipework) show that these are a significant source of drinking water lead contamination.

With regard to the effects of radiation on health, many of the problems faced today, including uncertainties in the relationship between risk and dose and the origins of the psychosocial phenomena associated with many aspects of environmental radiation exposure, arise from a lack of adequate frameworks within which to understand the radiopathological impact of radiation exposure and the psychological and social implications of such exposures.

40|$|The steady {{increase}} in the number of radiologic procedures being performed is undeniably having a beneficial impact on healthcare. However, it is also becoming common practice to quantify the <b>health</b> <b>detriment</b> from radiation exposure by calculating the number of cancer-related deaths inferred from the effective dose delivered to a given patient population. The inference of a certain number of expected deaths from the effective dose is to be discouraged, but it remains important as a means of raising professional awareness of the danger associated with ionizing radiation. The risk associated with a radiologic examination appears to be rather low compared with the natural risk. However, any added risk, no matter how small, is unacceptable if it does not benefit the patient. The concept of diagnostic reference levels should be used to reduce variations in practice among institutions and to promote optimal dose indicator ranges for specific imaging protocols. In general, the basic principles of radiation protection (eg, justification and optimization of a procedure) need to be respected to help counteract the unjustified explosion in the number of procedures being performed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{incidence}} of obesity is increasing rapidly {{all over the}} world and results in numerous <b>health</b> <b>detriments,</b> including disruptions in reproduction. However, the mechanisms by which excess body fat interferes with reproductive functions are still not fully understood. After weaning, female rats were treated with a cafeteria diet or a chow diet (control group). Biometric and metabolic parameters were evaluated in adulthood. Reproductive parameters, including estradiol, progesterone, LH and prolactin during the proestrus afternoon, sexual behavior, ovulation rates and histological analysis of ovaries were also evaluated. Cafeteria diet was able to induce obesity in female rats by increasing body and fat pad weight, which resulted in increased levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL and induced insulin resistance. The cafeteria diet also negatively affected female reproduction by reducing the number of oocytes and preantral follicles, as well as the thickness of the follicular layer. Obese females did not show preovulatory progesterone and LH surges, though plasma estradiol and prolactin showed preovulatory surges similar to control rats. Nevertheless, sexual receptiveness was not altered by cafeteria diet. Taken together, our results suggest that the cafeteria diet administered from weaning age was able to induce obesity and reduce the reproductive capability in adult female rats, indicating that this obesity model can be used to better understand the mechanisms underlying reproductive dysfunction in obese subjects...|$|R

However, stressful life events such as the separation from a parent are known to have a severe impact on physical and mental health of children. This study, conducted in 2008 - 2009, explored health consequences of migratory separation for remaining-behind adolescent children, comparing them with those whose parents remained at home. Participants were 205 high school students from the Philippines. It was found that adolescents with a parent abroad, particularly the mother, reported poorer physical health than those with both parents at home, while socioeconomic status did not have impact. The parent-abroad adolescents reported a high level of missing their parent(s) and felt emotionally lonelier than the parent-at-home group. Emotional loneliness and stress due to parental absence were associated with poorer health. Avoidant coping appeared to moderate the parental absence-health relationship. Paradoxically, it seems that, although many parents work abroad to improve the lot of their children, the latter suffer emotional stress and physical <b>health</b> <b>detriments.</b> While Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) cognitive stress model is generally applicable for migratory separation, cultural aspects need attention, both in theoretical implementation and interpretation.

The article reports on an investigation into the impacts of traffic on quality {{of life in}} a residential area of Bristol (UK), a city which in the British context is particularly car dependent. In essence the study replicated Appleyard‟s (1969) research on traffic and neighbourhood social interaction. Primary data were collected through observations and a series of interviews with 60 households on three streets selected for their contrasting levels of traffic. The results confirmed that Appleyard‟s findings are applicable to the UK in the 21 st century; specifically that the number of friends and acquaintances reported by residents was significantly lower on streets with higher volumes of motor traffic. The extent of people's home territories also diminished as motor traffic increased. Other notable outcomes from the research include the finding that individuals' perceptions of road safety in their neighbourhood may be disproportionately influenced by the traffic conditions on their street of residence, especially affecting the degree of independence granted to children. The findings are considered against the context of existing policy solutions to reduce traffic impacts, leading to the conclusion that the tools exist to reclaim urban residential neighbourhoods from traffic, but this will require considerable political will...|$|R

40|$|Scientific {{developments}} in the 1990 `s {{have important implications for}} the assessment of cancer risks posed by exposures to trichloroethylene (TCE). These new {{developments in}}clude: epidemiological studies; experimental studies of TCE carcinogenicity, metabolism and metabolite carcinogenicity; applications of new physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for TCE; and new pharmacodynamic data obtained for TCE and its rhetabolites. Following a review of previous assessments of TCE carcinogenicity, each of these new sets of developments is summarized. The new epidemiological data do not provide evidence of TCE carcinogenicity in humans, and the new pharmacodynamic data support the hypothesis that TCE carcinogenicity is caused by TCE-induced cytotoxicity. Based on this information, PBPK-based estimates for likely no-adverse effect levels (NOAELs) for human exposures to TCE are calculated to be 16 ppb for TCE in air respired 24 hr/day, and 210 ppb for TCE in drinking water. Cancer risks of zero are predicted for TCE exposures below these calculated NOAELs. For comparison, hypothetical cancer risks posed by lifetime ingestive and multiroute household exposures to TCE in drinking water, at the currently enforced Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) concentration of 5 ppb are extrapolated from animal bioassay data using a conservative, linear dose-response model. These TCE-related risks are compared to corresponding ones associated with concentrations of chlorination by-products (CBP) in household water. It is shown that, from the standpoint of comparative hypothetical cancer risks, based on conservative linear dose-response extrapolations, there would likely be no health benefit, and more likely a possible <b>health</b> <b>detriment,</b> associated with any switch from a household water supply containing < 375 ppb TCE to one containing CBP at levels corresponding to the currently proposed 80 -ppb MCL for total trihalomethanes...|$|E

The International Space Station (ISS) serves now as one of the leading platforms for applying active and passive radiation detectors for either area monitoring and also for the determination of the personal radiation dose the crew receives. In addition various experiments designed for dedicated purposes are used onboard the ISS to answer relevant questions related to the composition of the radiation field outside and inside the space station. These are for example the MATROSHKA torso experiments for effective dose equivalent estimations, or the ALTEA experiment for determination of the flux of heavy charged particles and in addition new developments as the ISS-RAD detector and the ESA Active Dosimeter (EAD) project. Further on new technology demonstration activities as the PERSEO radiation vest flight demonstrator for the upcoming ESA mission of Paolo Nespoli emphasize the current work on getting astronaut´s safer in orbit. The presentation will give an overview over past and current activities in Europe in relation to space radiation dosimetry and an outlook for what is going to come for exploration...|$|R

Bourguiba also abolished the dual system of justice, ended the influence of religious on the judiciary and established civil courts.|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of obesity is increasing rapidly {{all over the}} world and results in numerous <b>health</b> <b>detriments,</b> including disruptions in reproduction. However, the mechanisms by which excess body fat interferes with reproductive functions are still not fully understood. After weaning, female rats were treated with a cafeteria diet or a chow diet (control group). Biometric and metabolic parameters were evaluated in adulthood. Reproductive parameters, including estradiol, progesterone, LH and prolactin during the proestrus afternoon, sexual behavior, ovulation rates and histological analysis of ovaries were also evaluated. Cafeteria diet was able to induce obesity in female rats by increasing body and fat pad weight, which resulted in increased levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL and induced insulin resistance. The cafeteria diet also negatively affected female reproduction by reducing the number of oocytes and preantral follicles, as well as the thickness of the follicular layer. Obese females did not show preovulatory progesterone and LH surges, though plasma estradiol and prolactin showed preovulatory surges similar to control rats. Nevertheless, sexual receptiveness was not altered by cafeteria diet. Taken together, our results suggest that the cafeteria diet administered from weaning age was able to induce obesity and reduce the reproductive capability in adult female rats, indicating that this obesity model can be used to better understand the mechanisms underlying reproductive dysfunction in obese subjects.
