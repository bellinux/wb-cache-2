Heading into the Draft, he was ranked as the ninth-best North American skater by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. NHL teams had concerns about his size, but were impressed by <b>his</b> <b>skill</b> and work ethic. At the Draft, the New Jersey Devils traded to obtain the 17th overall pick from the Edmonton Oilers {{and used it to}} select Parise.|$|E
5|$|Bewick's art is {{considered}} the pinnacle of his medium, now called wood engraving. This is due both to <b>his</b> <b>skill</b> and to the method, which unlike the wood cut technique of his predecessors, carves against the grain, in hard box wood, using fine tools normally favoured by metal engravers.|$|E

However, because the market is much bigger for toilet bowl cleaners, Vanish was his {{greatest}} success. <b>His</b> <b>skills</b> as an inventor were much less important than <b>his</b> <b>skills</b> as a marketer. The world of household cleansers is rife with me-too products.|$|R
5|$|Draco Malfoy is a slim, pale boy {{who speaks}} in a bored drawl. He is arrogant about <b>his</b> <b>skill</b> in Quidditch, and despises anyone {{who is not a}} pure-blood wizard– and wizards who do not share his views. His parents had {{supported}} Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard's disappearance, claiming they had been bewitched. Draco avoids direct confrontations, and tries to get Harry and his friends into trouble.|$|E

5|$|Mikoyan {{made several}} key trips to {{communist}} Cuba {{and to the}} United States, acquiring an important stature on the international diplomatic scene, especially with <b>his</b> <b>skill</b> in exercising soft power to further Soviet interests. In 1964 Khrushchev was forced to step down in a coup that brought Brezhnev to power. Mikoyan served as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal Head of State, from 1964 until his forced retirement in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{was among}} the most {{influential}} jazz musicians of his lifetime. Grove Music Online describes his legacy as at least fourfold: as a pioneer of hard bop; as a user of what became the archetypal quintet instrumentation of tenor saxophone, trumpet, piano, bass, and drums; as a developer of young musicians who went on to become important players and bandleaders; and for <b>his</b> <b>skill</b> as a composer and arranger.|$|E
5|$|Aside from hockey, Gardiner {{excelled in}} Canadian football, and {{had joined the}} Winnipeg Tammany Tigers junior club in 1920. As a defender, Gardiner quickly gained {{attention}} for <b>his</b> <b>skill,</b> and helped the Tigers reach the Western Canadian junior rugby championship in Regina, Saskatchewan, though they lost the championship game. The following year he changed positions and played as a right outer wing; the Tigers went through the season undefeated and again played in the Western Canadian championship game; held in Regina like the previous year, the team again lost. While with the Tammany Tigers Gardiner played in the 13th Grey Cup, the Canadian football championship, losing against the Ottawa Senators 24–1.|$|E

[...] He accepted {{one of the two}} baseball scholarships, at Southeastern Community College in Keokuk, Iowa, because of his preference for playing a less hazardous game. His reasoning was clear from what he later told a Sports Illustrated reporter: [...] "I didn't want to have 6'5", 250-pound guys bearing down on me, so I decided to play baseball." ...|$|R

5|$|Central to {{the ceiling}} {{decoration}} are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis of which The Creation of Adam is the best known, having an iconic standing equaled only by Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, the hands of God and Adam being reproduced in countless imitations. The complex design includes several sets of individual figures, both clothed and nude, which allowed Michelangelo to fully demonstrate <b>his</b> <b>skill</b> in creating a huge variety of poses for the human figure and which have provided an enormously influential pattern book of models for other artists ever since.|$|E
5|$|During Lord Dunmore's War, {{a border}} {{conflict}} between colonists and American Indians, Isaac Shelby was commissioned as a {{lieutenant in the}} Virginia militia by Colonel William Preston. As second-in-command of his father's Fincastle County company, he {{took part in the}} decisive Battle of Point Pleasant on October 10, 1774. The younger Shelby earned commendation for <b>his</b> <b>skill</b> and gallantry in this battle. The victorious militiamen erected Fort Blair {{on the site of the}} battle. They remained stationed there, with Shelby as second-in-command, until July 1775 when Lord Dunmore ordered the fort destroyed, fearing it might become useful to colonial rebels in the growing American Revolution.|$|E

During this time, Novikov was noted for <b>his</b> <b>skill</b> in command and for his innovation, particularly the then unknown use of radio to coordinate bomber flights. In July 1941, Novikov expanded his command from Leningrad to include air forces of the Northern Front, Northwestern Front and the Baltic Fleet, and as the Germans approached Leningrad, Novikov and his forces flew 16,567 sorties.|$|E

5|$|Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has {{to avoid}} judging them against a {{background}} of similar designs in Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was a developing country, where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing to take account of the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed <b>his</b> <b>skill</b> in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{eventually}} switched {{sides and}} joined the Labour Party. His conversion, especially {{in the light of}} later events, was regarded by some as suspect: his entry in the Dictionary of Labour Biography reports speculation that Hastings foresaw that Labour may come to Government and had few senior lawyers to fill the Law Officer posts. John Paton, after speaking from the same Independent Labour Party (ILP) platform as Hastings, {{came to the conclusion that}} Hastings gave political speeches using <b>his</b> <b>skill</b> as a lawyer to master a brief; on the train home, Hastings appeared not to have heard of the ILP.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Pennsylvania law {{required}} that school students read Bible verses {{to start the}} day. The Abington School District added another requirement that the students read the Lord's Prayer. Several Unitarians in Abington, a suburb of Philadelphia, objected and held a protest against it. One of them, Ellery Schempp, contacted the American Civil Liberties Union about the issue. The ACLU and Schempp's parents believed the school prayer law violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The ACLU's lawyers saw Sawyer as the best choice to argue it, given <b>his</b> <b>skill</b> as a litigator and his success in the Deutch case. Sawyer agreed and filed suit in federal district court.|$|E

5|$|In Dorset, Druitt {{played for}} the Kingston Park Cricket Club, and the Dorset County Cricket Club. He was {{particularly}} noted for <b>his</b> <b>skill</b> as a bowler. In 1882 and 1883, he toured the West Country with a gentleman's touring team called the Incogniti. One of Druitt's fellow local players was Francis Lacey, the first man knighted for services to cricket. Druitt played for another wandering team, the Butterflies, on 14 June 1883, when they drew against his alma mater Winchester College. The team included first-class cricketers A. J. Webbe, J. G. Crowdy, John Frederick and Charles Seymour.|$|E
5|$|Ip {{figures out}} that Lin was beaten {{and killed by}} the Japanese after an earlier fight. Barely able to contain his rage, Ip demands a match with ten karateka at once. Despite having not practiced Wing Chun since the Japanese {{occupied}} their town (to conserve energy and thus food for his family), he mercilessly defeats all of them with a brutal and effective barrage of blows, showing none of the restraint he exhibited in earlier matches. <b>His</b> <b>skill</b> arouses the interest of General Miura, who wants {{to learn more about}} Ip and watch him fight again.|$|E
5|$|Jimsy Augustine, a young college student, goes to Bhavana Studio.

Perplexed at the unusual request, Mahesh conducts the photo shoot. Jimsy's photograph turns out to be dull and unimpressive, and her irritation makes Mahesh question <b>his</b> <b>skill</b> as a photographer. Upset, he turns to his father for advice. Vincent explains photography as an art to his son. Mahesh goes through his father's photograph collection, finally understanding their angles and lighting, and gets an idea.|$|E
