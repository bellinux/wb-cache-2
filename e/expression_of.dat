40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effects of recipes for {{replenishing}} qi and activating blood on p 16, p 21, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin D 1 and cyclin E gene expressions in the liver of aging rats. Methods: A recipe for replenishing qi and a recipe for activating blood were administered to aging rats respectively, and {{the effects of}} the above recipes on the <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> senescence related genes (p 16, p 21, PCNA, cyclin D 1 and cyclin E) were examined by RT-PCR and Western blotting methods. Results: The <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> p 16, p 21 and cyclin D 1 mRNAs and proteins in the liver of the untreated aging rats were up-regulated, while the <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> PCNA and cyclin E mRNAs and proteins decreased. As compared with the untreated aging rats, both recipes could down-regulate the <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> cyclin D 1 mRNA and protein and up-regulate the <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> cyclin E mRNA and protein, but had no obvious effects on the <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> mRNAs and proteins of p 16, p 21 and PCNA. Conclusion: Recipes for replenishing qi and activating blood can improve the liver cell proliferation of aging rats via down-regulating the <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> cyclin D 1 mRNA and protein and up-regulating the <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> cyclin E mRNA and protein...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} I {{analysed}} the semantic motivation of the Finnish local cases inessive and adessive in the metonymical <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> state of action. I tried to analyse which metonymical <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> state of action occur in inessive {{and which ones}} in adessive or in both cases and why. I defined the metonymical <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> state <b>of</b> action as <b>expressions</b> in inessive or adessive expressed in the construction [theme + the verb olla/käydä + the expression in inessive/adessive], in which they obtain the meaning of state of action. This work provides a picture <b>of</b> the metonymical <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> state of action in inessive/adessive in a corpus of 100 590 023 tokens selected from Kielipankki's corpus of the Finnish language. For analysing the metonymical <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> state of action in inessive/adessive I used the analysis of state denoting local case expressions by T. Onikki-Rantajääskö (2001) and the analysis of spacial meanings of inessive and adessive by P. Leino (1989, 1993, 2002), which are both based on R. W. Langacker's cognitive grammar (1987, 1991, 2002) and on the cognitive linguistic approach in general. I chose this topic because the local case endings are polysemic, they express many meanings and the semantic contrasts expressed by them in the spacial field and in the metonymical <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> [...] ...|$|R

By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript.
