40|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>crises</b> mainly {{manifest}} {{themselves at the}} level of financial institutions. Although <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> can also be generated within non-financial institutions, the role of banking institutions in the occurrence, transmitting and solving of <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> is a deciding one. Banks play a deciding {{role in the development of}} <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> as <b>financial</b> intermediaries who contribute to the efficient transfer of funds from the abundant agent towards the deficit agents. Banks can facilitate the <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> through the activities performed on the financial markets that can influence the interest rates, the uncertainty on the market and the price of assets, but moreover bank crises can occur that transform <b>financial</b> <b>crises.</b> This paper aims to analyze the role of banks in the emergence, the propagation, the prevention or solving <b>financial</b> <b>crises.</b> <b>financial</b> <b>crises,</b> bank crises, contagion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{examines the}} quantitative approach to <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> from two perspectives. First, {{the assumption of}} comparability of <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> is analyzed. The key question here is: how comparable are crises? An important consideration here is the context – social and political. Second, if <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> are comparable to a certain extent, then {{we should be able}} to make predictions. Thus, the second key question is: how predictable are crises? The results have implications for the development of a theory of <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> and government policies on crisis management. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence for}} the immediate or short-term responses to <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> of US multinational firm (MNE) subsidiaries. Using a real options perspective, we hypothesize that <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> change the relative value of 'within-country' versus 'across-country' options for MNE subsidiaries. We suggest that relocating subsidiary output is an effective short-term response to local <b>financial</b> <b>crises.</b> We {{examine the effects of}} 83 <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> (banking, debt and currency crises) on longitudinal data of US MNEs' subsidiary sales in over 50 countries in the period 1983 - 2005. Our results show market-switching effects. Particularly in the case of local currency crises we observe a refocus of the MNE's subsidiary local sales toward export markets. The effect is maintained in the occurrence of twin <b>financial</b> <b>crises.</b> These results confirm our expectation that <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> cause an increase in the value of 'across-country' option relative to 'within-country' option.

40|$|The {{costs of}} wars {{have been the}} main driver of public debt in the Western World during the modern era. The late twentieth century stands out as a period that saw a {{pronounced}} increase of government debt to GDP ratios in peacetime. This paper assesses the role that <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> have played in shaping the public debt trajectory in the twentieth century. Focusing on the experiences of 14 industrial economies, I show that <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> have long and lasting effects on public finances. I provide evidence {{that the costs of}} <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> have increased strongly {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century and that the costs of <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> grow with the size of the financial sector. In many countries, the rising costs incurred from stabilizing the economy after <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> were an important cause of the peacetime surge of public debt ratios in the late twentieth century. In today's highly financialized economies, <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> have become a key risk for public finances...|$|R
40|$|Orthodox and heterodox {{theories}} of <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> are hereby compared from a theoretical viewpoint, {{with emphasis on}} their genesis. The former view (represented by the fourth-generation models of Paul Krugman) reflects the neoclassical vision whereby turbulence is an exception; the latter insight (represented by the {{theories of}} Hyman P. Minsky) validates and extends John Maynard Keynes's vision, since it is related to a modern financial world. The result of this theoretical exercise is that Minsky's vision represents a superior explanation of <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> and current events in financial systems because it considers the causes of <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> as endogenous to the system. Crucial facts in relevant <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> are mentioned in section 1, as an introduction; the orthodox models of <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> are described in section 2; the heterodox models of <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> are outlined in section 3; the main {{similarities and differences between}} orthodox and heterodox models of <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> are identified in section 4; and conclusions based on the information provided by the previous section are outlined in section 5.

40|$|An {{agent-based}} {{financial market}} model {{is used to}} simulate the effects of financial regulation to reduce financial leverage. Results suggest that regulating leverage using margin calls can lead to less frequent <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> per century, however, it creates harder hit <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> than without regulation. In addition, regulation where the central authority tries to prick bubbles also leads to less frequent <b>financial</b> <b>crises,</b> but, creates greater volatility. Lastly, I find that leverage regulation where agent's ability to borrow is not dependent on price produces less frequent crises and less volatility than the other regimes.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> focusing on three specific aspects. First, what are the main factors explaining <b>financial</b> <b>crises?</b> Since many theories on the sources of <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> highlight the importance of sharp fluctuations in asset and credit markets, the paper briefly reviews theoretical and empirical studies on developments in these markets around <b>financial</b> <b>crises.</b> Second, what are the major types of <b>financial</b> <b>crises?</b> The paper focuses on the main theoretical and empirical explanations of four types of <b>financial</b> crises—currency <b>crises,</b> sudden stops, debt crises, and banking crises—and presents {{a survey of the}} literature that attempts to identify these episodes. Third, what are the real and financial sector implications of crises? The paper briefly reviews the short- and medium-run implications of crises for the real economy and financial sector. It concludes with a summary of the main lessons from the literature and future research directions...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{evolution}} of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to developing and emerging countries around <b>financial</b> <b>crises.</b> We empirically and thoroughly examine the Fire‐Sale FDI hypothesis and describe the pattern of FDI inflows surrounding <b>financial</b> <b>crises.</b> We also add a more granular detail about the types of <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> and their potentially differential effects on FDI. We distinguish between Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) and Greenfield investment, {{as well as between}} different motivations for FDI—horizontal (tariff jumping) and vertical (integrating production stages). We find that <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> have a strong negative effect on inward FDI in our sample. Crises are also shown to reduce the value of horizontal and vertical FDI. We do not find empirical evidence of Fire‐Sale FDI. On the contrary, <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> are shown to affect FDI flows and M&A activity adversely...|$|R
40|$|Output falls precipitously in most {{emerging}} {{nations that}} experience <b>financial</b> <b>crises.</b> The authors conjecture {{that a significant}} part of the real impact of <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> is due to the fact that during turbulent times firms choose to leave a large fraction of productive resources idle until business conditions improve. In the case of Mexico’s 1994 – 95 crisis, they calculate that capital utilization could account for as much as half the drop in standard measures of total factor productivity. Capital utilization matters much more during <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> than during other periods, they argue, because crises create ideal conditions for large swings in utilization rates. <b>Financial</b> <b>crises...</b>|$|R
40|$|We study {{cross-country}} GDP losses due to <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> {{in terms}} of frequency (number of loss events per period) and severity (loss per occurrence).

The asymmetric information approach explains the patterns in the data and many features of these crises which are otherwise hard to explain. It also suggests why <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> have had such important consequences for the aggregate economy over the past one hundred and fifty years. ...|$|R
