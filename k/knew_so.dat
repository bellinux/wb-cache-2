5|$|The native Britons had {{converted}} to Christianity under Roman rule. The Anglo-Saxon invasions separated the British church from European Christianity for centuries, so {{the church in}} Rome had no presence or authority in Britain, and in fact, Rome <b>knew</b> <b>so</b> little about the British church that it was unaware of any schism in customs. However, Æthelberht would have known something about the Roman church from his Frankish wife, Bertha, who had brought a bishop, Liudhard, with her across the Channel, and for whom Æthelberht built a chapel, St Martin's.|$|E
25|$|Hiring De Niro {{turned out}} to be a casting coup because he <b>knew</b> <b>so</b> many actors in New York. De Niro brought Meryl Streep to the {{attention}} of Cimino and Deeley. With Streep came John Cazale. De Niro also accompanied Cimino to scout locations for the steel mill sequence as well as rehearsed with the actors to use the workshops as a bonding process.|$|E
25|$|In October 2000, Zimmer {{performed}} live {{in concert}} {{for the first}} time with an orchestra and choir at the 27th Annual Flanders International Film Festival in Ghent. While writing the score for The Last Samurai, Zimmer felt that his knowledge of Japanese music was extremely limited. He began doing extensive research, but the more he studied, the less he felt he knew. Finally, Zimmer took what he had written to Japan for feedback and was shocked when he was asked how he <b>knew</b> <b>so</b> much about Japanese music.|$|E

25|$|The {{other great}} poet of the preclassical period was Hesiod. Unlike Homer, Hesiod speaks {{of himself in}} his poetry. Nonetheless, nothing is known about him from any {{external}} source. He {{was a native of}} Boeotia in central Greece, and is thought to have lived and worked around 700 BC. Hesiod's two extant poems are Works and Days and Theogony. Works and Days is a faithful depiction of the poverty-stricken country life he <b>knew</b> <b>so</b> well, and it sets forth principles and rules for farmers. Theogony is a systematic account of creation and of the gods. It vividly describes the ages of mankind, beginning with a long-past Golden Age.|$|E
25|$|When Warner's Rhino {{released}} four early Replacements albums from Twin/Tone in April 2008, Stinson and Westerberg {{discussed a}} reunion in Billboard. Westerberg {{was in favor}} of waiting for the reissues of the four Sire albums later that year. Which drummer they had in mind might be unknown. Stinson had praised Foley's work which was on beat rather than behind it like Mars. Westerberg was impressed initially that Foley <b>knew</b> <b>so</b> much of The Replacements' material but also criticized him as he did most of his bandmates. Josh Freese played drums and Mars contributed backup vocals but not drums on a Rhino compilation in 2005. Practice in October 2008 was with Michael Bland.|$|E
25|$|Before he returned, he {{answered}} a challenge set down by Effie Gray, whom he later married. The twelve-year-old Effie {{had asked him}} to write a fairy story. During a six-week break at Leamington Spa to undergo Dr. Jephson's (1798–1878) celebrated salt-water cure, Ruskin wrote his only work of fiction, the fairy tale, The King of the Golden River (published in December 1850 (but imprinted 1851) with illustrations by Richard Doyle). A work of Christian sacrificial morality and charity, it is set in the Alpine landscape Ruskin loved and <b>knew</b> <b>so</b> well. It remains the most translated of all his works. At Oxford, he sat for a pass degree in 1842, and was awarded with an uncommon honorary double fourth-class degree in recognition of his achievements.|$|E

25|$|I {{was very}} much {{surprised}} when Mill informed {{me that he had}} not read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire Hegelian philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry. I mentally confronted this with the opinion of the man at the Copenhagen University who knew the history of philosophy best, my teacher, Hans Brochner, who <b>knew,</b> <b>so</b> to speak, nothing of contemporary English and French philosophy, and did not think them worth studying. I {{came to the conclusion that}} here was a task for one who understood the thinkers of the two directions, who did not mutually understand one another. I thought that in philosophy, too, I knew what I wanted, and saw a road open in front of me.|$|E
25|$|Despite the problems, {{this was}} a time of {{optimism}} for many. A baby boom followed the war, as young Dutch couples started planning their families. They had lived through the hardships of depression and the hell of war. They wanted to start fresh and live better lives without the poverty, starvation, terror, and extreme frugality they <b>knew</b> <b>so</b> well. They had little taste for a strictly imposed rule-oriented traditional system with its rigid hierarchies, sharp pillarized boundaries and strictly orthodox religious doctrines. They made a best seller out of the translation of The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care (1946), by American pediatrician Benjamin Spock. His vision of family life as companionate, permissive, enjoyable and even fun took hold, and seemed the best way to achieve family happiness in a dawning age of freedom and prosperity.|$|E

[...] According to Stoller, the duo was [...] "surprised at the kind of knowledge that he had about black music. We figured that he had these remarkable pipes and all that, but we didn't realize that he <b>knew</b> <b>so</b> much about the blues.

After a Hawaiian dance craze began, he wrote [...] "That Hula-Hula", and then did a string of southern songs, such as [...] "When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam". During this period, he was creating a few new songs every week, including songs aimed at the various immigrant cultures arriving from Europe. On one occasion, Berlin, whose face was still not known, was on a train trip and decided to entertain the fellow passengers with some music.

2500|$|Beginning 1933, Tzigara {{was several}} times interviewed by Eugen Wolbe, the German biographer of Romanian kings, {{who had been}} sent to him by Carol II. Tzigara also {{reviewed}} Wolbe's texts, including his work on Queen Elisabeth (a [...] "weak" [...] study, in Tzigara's opinion), and described the visiting writer as an unreliable amateur: [...] "that pensioned ex-Gymnasiallehrer still had the audacity to select himself such august subjects, with the pretext of 'gaining many new friends for the beautiful country' of Romania, of which yet he himself <b>knew</b> <b>so</b> little!" [...] Tzigara was upset to receive a copy of Wolbe's 1937 work on Ferdinand, which, he claimed, entirely ignored specific criticism; he also approved of Prime Minister Gheorghe Tătărescu's decision to ban the volume in its Romanian edition (the censoring left Wolbe indifferent, a fact noted in one of his letters to Tzigara). Tzigara's rival Iorga, probably incited by this controversy and by his own work with Wolbe, gave the book a positive review in his journal Neamul Românesc, calling the government measure [...] "regrettable", and receiving further criticism from Tzigara, through Convorbiri.|$|E

2500|$|Contemporaries {{and historians}} have {{explored}} Sumner's personality at length. Sumner's friend Senator Carl Schurz praised Sumner's integrity, his [...] "moral courage," [...] the [...] "sincerity of his convictions,” and the [...] "disinterestedness of his motives.” [...] However, Sumner's Pulitzer-prize-winning biographer, David Donald, presents Sumner {{in his first}} volume, Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War (1960), as an insufferably arrogant moralist; an egoist bloated with pride; pontifical and Olympian, and unable to distinguish between large issues and small ones. [...] What's more, concludes Donald, Sumner was a coward who avoided confrontations with his many enemies, whom he routinely insulted in prepared speeches. But none of his friends at the time doubted his courage, and abolitionist Wendell Phillips, who knew Sumner well, remembered that southerners in the 1850s in Washington wondered, every time Sumner left his house in the morning, whether {{he would return to}} it alive. Just before he died, Sumner turned to his friend Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar. [...] "Judge," [...] he said, [...] "tell Emerson how much I love and revere him."
