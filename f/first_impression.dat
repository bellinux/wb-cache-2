5|$|On the east, the <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> {{is all of}} rock. The long strath of Grisedale runs north-eastward to Ullswater, {{cutting off}} a series of hanging valleys which fall from the Helvellyn range. To the south east of Nethermost Pike, below the summit of High Crag, is Ruthwaite Cove. Surrounded by crag on three sides, this corrie {{contains}} Hard Tarn, a small pool on a rock shelf. This {{is one of the}} most difficult mountain tarns to locate, and its black algal bed and clear water combine to give the false impression of great depth. Ruthwaite Cove is now the site of Ruthwaite Lodge, a climbing hut. It was formerly the setting for more industrial activity, with the remains of several underground mines and some shallow open workings visible near the Lodge.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer was {{transferred}} to IV Gruppe of NJG1 (IV./NJG1—4th group of the 1st Night Fighter Wing), based in the Netherlands at Leeuwarden Air Base, where he was appointed Staffelkapitän (squadron leader) of the 12. Staffel (12./NJG1—12th squadron of 1st Night Fighter Wing) on 13 August 1943. He took over command from Oberleutnant Eberhard Gardiewski, who had been taken prisoner of war. At the time, IV./NJG1 was {{under the leadership of}} Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) Hauptmann Hans-Joachim Jabs. Jabs' <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> of Schnaufer was not entirely favourable. Shortly after Schnaufer's arrival, on one of his first missions in Leeuwarden, Schnaufer had taken right of way during taxiing. This forced Jabs into second place in order of takeoff, an act of insubordination and perceived as arrogant by Jabs.|$|E
5|$|Anime cutscenes are {{included}} in each game, and are a primary focus for the production team as they help make the <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> on players. The series aims to avoid standard anime tropes and common narrative elements with each installment. The first game to feature such cutscenes was Destiny. The cutscenes were animated by Production I.G, which has provided cutscenes for the series until Xillia. For Xillia, aiming to demonstrate a new artistic direction for the series, production of the anime cutscenes was given to Ufotable. For the Nintendo DS release of Hearts, two identical versions of the game were released as an experiment by the production team, with one featuring traditional anime animation by Production I.G., and one featuring computer-generated cutscenes by Shirogumi Ltd. The CGI cutscenes proved less popular with fans than the established anime style.|$|E
40|$|Appearance {{is known}} to {{influence}} social interactions, which in turn could potentially influence personality development. In this study we focus on discovering the relationship between self-reported personality traits, <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> and facial characteristics. The results reveal that several personality traits can be read above chance from a face, and that facial features influence <b>first</b> <b>impressions.</b> Despite the former, our prediction model fails to reliably infer personality traits from either facial features or <b>first</b> <b>impressions.</b> <b>First</b> <b>impressions,</b> however, could be inferred more reliably from facial features. We have generated artificial, extreme faces visualising the characteristics having an effect on <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> for several traits. Conclusively, we find a relationship between <b>first</b> <b>impressions,</b> some personality traits and facial features and consolidate that people on average assess a given face in a highly similar manner...|$|R
2500|$|Once formed, <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> {{tend to be}} stable. A {{review of}} the {{literature}} on the accuracy and impact of <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> on rater-based assessments found that raters' <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> are highly correlated with later scores, but it is unclear exactly why. One study tested stability by asking participants to form impressions people based purely on photographs. Participants' opinions of the people in photographs did not significantly differ after interacting with that person a month later. One potential reason for this stability is that one's <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> could serve as a guide for his/her next steps, such as what questions are asked and how raters go about scoring. More research needs to be done on the stability of <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> to fully understand how <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> guide subsequent treatment, self-fulfilling prophecies, and the halo effect. Assessment tools can influence impressions too, for example if a question provides only a dichotomous [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no" [...] response or if a rater uses a scale (ratio). Although this study was conducted with the intention of improving rating methods in medical education, the literature review was sufficiently broad enough to generalize.|$|R

5|$|Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows: Lincoln is a {{high school}} {{drop-out}} and a convicted felon, who is wrongfully accused of and charged {{with the murder of}} Terence Steadman, the brother of the Vice President of the United States. Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break. Scheuring's <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the set {{on the first day of}} filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker was {{published}} in the UK by Jonathan Cape in hardback format on 5 April 1955 with a cover designed by Kenneth Lewis, following Fleming's suggestions of using a stylised flame motif; the <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> was of 9,900 copies. The US publication was by Macmillan on 20 September that year. In October 1956 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 43,000 copies {{before the end of the}} year. In December that year the US paperback {{was published}} under the title Too Hot to Handle by Permabooks. This edition was rewritten to Americanise the British idioms used, and Fleming provided a number of explanatory footnotes such as the value of English currency against the dollar. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of This World is {{considered}} to be Alejo Carpentier's first great novel. He is praised for his skillful inclusion of Haitian voodoo, myth, and history in the work, as well as for contributing to the definition of Latin American identity. Although the presence of magic realism in The Kingdom of This World has been acclaimed by critics and discussed at length within the academic community, this concern is paralleled by a lack of interest in Carpentier's technical work in the novel. In particular, his vision of time has been widely ignored. The Kingdom of This World has also been criticized for its narrative organization, which predominantly relies on opposition rather than on succession: the novel does not present history in terms of a sequence of events and their consequences. The gaps within chronological time that occur throughout this novel as well as the sudden changes of perspective and minimal transitional narrative have led some to criticize the book for the chaotic <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> it gives the reader.|$|E

50|$|When Jane Austen {{wrote her}} first novel, {{a novel about}} the Bennet family of Longbourne, she called it <b>First</b> <b>Impressions,</b> but she couldn’t find a {{publisher}}. However, once Sense & Sensibility, Austen’s second novel, became a popular success, T. Egerton of Whitehall, the publisher of Sense & Sensibility, agreed to release <b>First</b> <b>Impressions</b> with a new name: Pride & Prejudice. In this early instance of successful branding, a novel called <b>First</b> <b>Impressions</b> went nowhere, but given a new title, Pride & Prejudice quickly {{became one of the}} great classics of Western literature.|$|R
30|$|Notwithstanding a large cost of self-selection, {{we found}} that <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> were {{substantially}} enhanced by profile image selection and these selections were tailored to social networking contexts. Overall, participants {{were aware of the}} impressions made by different images of their face and made profile image choices accordingly, fitting facial <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> to the social context of the audience. This extends recent work showing that people can detect subtle differences in impressions made by different photos of the same unfamiliar face, both when photos are captured in controlled studio conditions (Todorov & Porter, 2014) and in ambient environments (Jenkins et al., 2011). In parallel, computer scientists have made impressive progress in developing automated methods for predicting human’s <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> from ambient facial imagery. Using deep neural networks trained on human’s ratings of <b>first</b> <b>impressions,</b> McCurrie et al. (2016) were able to predict facial <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> from face images relatively accurately (cf. Vernon et al., 2014). In future work, it may be useful to compare human profile selection choices to these computational benchmarks.|$|R
5|$|Donna {{arrives at}} Holby City Hospital {{as a staff}} nurse on the general surgery ward, making a poor <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> by being disorganised and insolent. Mistakenly believing that living with her {{superior}} will ensure her an easy time at work, Donna invites herself {{to move in with}} nurse Lisa Fox (Luisa Bradshaw-White). The two have a strained relationship: within weeks, Donna is evicted for falling behind on her rent, and when she is later allowed to move back in, she lets bailiffs take Lisa's possessions after failing to keep up her own loan repayments. Forced to run a shift in charge of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit as recompense, Donna struggles to manage and learns a new respect for Lisa. During this period, Donna has a friendship with midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams). Mickie is questioning her sexuality, and the two have sex while drunk. Mickie is disappointed when Donna states that it was just a one-night stand, but they are able to reconcile their friendship. When the general surgery ward is downsized, Donna is forced to reapply for her job. Although she gives a good interview and impresses Lisa, other candidates have more experience, so she is unable to retain her position and has to work as a bank nurse.|$|E

40|$|Dress {{preserves}} history, embraces traditions, {{and links}} different generations together. With {{the ability to}} communicate non-verbally, dress conveys a picture or sends a message about its wearer to those who observe the individual. Therefore, dress can create <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> for the beholders. Previous research reveals that professional dress creates more positive <b>first</b> <b>impressions.</b> The goal {{of this study was to}} identify whether college students would react differently to different types of dress and whether specific types of dress would have influences on college students’ <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> of a male or female peer. Results of the study indicated that college students did not form positive <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> upon looking at professional business dress. They preferred casual and business casual attire, which was supported by their indications that they were more willing to have a conversation with those who were dressed in these styles. Both male and female college students expressed their preferences for casual and business casual clothes. The study reinforced findings of previous studies that dress and <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> are related...|$|R

25|$|In psychology, a <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> is {{the event}} when one person first {{encounters}} another person and forms a mental image of that person. Impression accuracy {{varies depending on}} the observer and the target (person, object, scene, etc.) being observed.|$|E
25|$|It takes just {{one-tenth of}} a second for us to judge someone and make a <b>first</b> <b>impression.</b> Research finds that the more time {{participants}} are afforded to form the impression, the more confidence in impressions they report. Not only are people quick to form first impressions, they are also fairly accurate when the target presents him or herself genuinely. People are generally not good at perceiving feigned emotions or detecting lies. Research participants who reported forming accurate impressions of specific targets did {{tend to have more}} accurate perceptions of specific targets that aligned with others' reports of the target. Individuals are also fairly reliable at understanding the <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> that he/she will project to others.|$|E
25|$|First {{impressions}} {{are formed}} within milliseconds {{of seeing a}} target. When intentionally forming a <b>first</b> <b>impression,</b> encoding relies on the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Readings from fMRIs of research participants show that processing of diagnostic information (e.g. distinguishing features) engaged the dmPFC more than processing neutral information.|$|E

25|$|Hodler et al. {{recommend}} to start scanning with conventional x-rays taken {{from at least}} two planes, since this method gives a wide <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> and even has the chance of exposing any frequent shoulder pathologies, i.e. decompensated rotator cuff tears, tendinitis calcarea, dislocations, fractures, usures and/or osteophytes. Furthermore, x-rays are required for the planning of an optimal CT or MR image.|$|E

25|$|There {{appears to}} be {{cross-cultural}} similarities in brain responses to <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> formations. In a mock election both American and Japanese individuals voted for the candidate that elicited a stronger response in their bilateral amygdala {{than those who did}} not, regardless of the candidate's culture. Individuals also showed a stronger response to cultural outgroup faces than cultural ingroup faces because the amygdala is presumably more sensitive to novel stimuli. However, this finding was unrelated to actual voting decisions.|$|E
