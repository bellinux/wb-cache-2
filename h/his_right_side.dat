5|$|Linnaeus' {{last years}} were troubled by illness. He had {{suffered}} from a disease called the Uppsala fever in 1764, but survived thanks {{to the care of}} Rosén. He developed sciatica in 1773, and the next year, he had a stroke which partially paralysed him. He suffered a second stroke in 1776, losing the use of <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> and leaving him bereft of his memory; while still able to admire his own writings, he could not recognise himself as their author.|$|E

Pete Hamilton did a four-tire stop and passed Pearson after the restart for the victory. In 19 starts, he won a single race (Darlington) and earned two pole positions (Bristol, Darlington) to finish 23rd in points.|$|E

5|$|Going {{into the}} 1994 Australian Grand Prix, the final {{race of the}} 1994 season, Schumacher led Damon Hill by a single point in the Drivers' Championship. Schumacher led the race from the beginning, but on lap 35 he went off track and hit the wall with <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> wheels, {{returning}} to the track at reduced speed, and with car damage, but still leading the race. At the next corner Hill attempted {{to pass on the}} inside, but Schumacher turned in sharply and they collided. Both cars were eliminated from the race and, as neither driver scored, Schumacher took the title. The race stewards judged it a racing accident and took no action against either driver, but public opinion is divided over the incident, and Schumacher was vilified in the British media.|$|E
5|$|In March 1923, Lenin {{suffered}} a third stroke {{and lost his}} ability to speak; that month, he experienced partial paralysis on <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> and began exhibiting sensory aphasia. By May, {{he appeared to be}} making a slow recovery, regaining some of his mobility, speech, and writing skills. In October, he made a final visit to the Moscow Kremlin. In his final weeks, Lenin was visited by Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Bukharin, with the latter visiting him at his Gorki mansion on the day of his death. On 21 January 1924, Lenin fell into a coma and died later that day. His official cause of death was recorded as an incurable disease of the blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Taylor overshot Castaway Cay and instead reached another land mass in southern Abaco Island. He then proceeded northwest as planned. He fully expected to find the Grand Bahama Island lying {{in front of him}} as expected. Instead, he eventually saw a land mass to <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>side,</b> the northern part of Abaco Island. Believing that this landmass to his right was the Grand Bahama Island and his compass was malfunctioning, he set a course to what he thought was southwest to head straight back to Fort Lauderdale.

5|$|The {{location}} of Kennedy's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him, but some witnesses said that Sirhan faced west as Kennedy {{moved through the}} pantry facing east. This {{has led to the}} suggestion that a second gunman actually fired the fatal shot, a possibility supported by former Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner for the County of Los Angeles Thomas Noguchi who stated that the fatal shot was behind Kennedy's right ear and had been fired at a distance of approximately one inch. Other witnesses, though, said that as Sirhan approached, Kennedy was turning to his left shaking hands, facing north and so exposing <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had wanted}} to study for a {{doctorate}} and proceed with a career in archaeology, Buczynski was dying. He became ill with the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which took advantage of his weakened immune system. He suffered partial paralysis on <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> as well as brain lesions, leaving him irritable and withdrawn, and required hospitalization. Upon release, he moved to Atlanta to be with Muto in January 1989. By this stage, he was unable to attend to basic tasks on his own, including eating and dressing himself, and required almost constant care, from both Muto and from carers based at St. Joseph Hospital. He began to talk with the hospital's Roman Catholic priest and finally decided to return to the faith of his birth, undertaking his confession of reconciliation in February. In March, his condition deteriorated, and he was admitted to the hospital, where he fell into a coma and died on the morning on Thursday, March 16.|$|E
5|$|Rescue {{operations}} {{took over}} 24hours; the pace was {{hampered by the}} decision to remove many of the logs by hand for fear that using heavy equipment to remove them would cause further collapses, resulting in further injuries to those still trapped. Students, including the entire Texas A football team and {{many members of the}} university's Corps of Cadets, rushed to the site to assist rescue workers with the manual removal of the logs. The Texas A civil engineering department was also called on to examine the site and help the workers determine the order in which the logs could be safely removed, and, {{at the request of the}} Texas Forest Service, Steely Lumber Company in Huntsville, Texas, sent log-moving equipment and operators. John Comstock was the last living person to be removed from the stack. He spent months in the hospital following amputation of his left leg and partial paralysis of <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>side.</b> Comstock returned to A in 2001 to finish his degree.|$|E

5|$|Cabaniss {{was killed}} in an {{accident}} on board the Swatara on January 19, 1882. An official report of the incident was released on March 25 of that year. According to the report, before-noon exercises on board the ship had just been completed when an order was made to prepare rifles for target practice. At around ten in the morning, Cabaniss was assisting in the instruction of the ship's second group of sailors when he broke off and entered the ship's engine room to instruct a sailor on his duties. An experienced sailor, Ensign James P. Parker, was explaining to new sailors how to properly load their guns. He showed them how to load and discharge the weapons using a practice round. He then reloaded his gun with live rounds, but apparently forgot this and fired one of them. The bullet ricocheted off the ship's deck, struck one of the guns, ricocheted off the deck again, and struck Cabaniss, killing him instantly. The ball first entered through his left arm, impacting it so strongly that it broke every bone in his elbow. It then entered his side, tearing his latissimus dorsi muscle; went into his chest, severing every major artery; ricocheted up to near his shoulder, exited <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>side,</b> and struck the man he was instructing in the shoulder. Cabaniss was reported to have never made a sound as he fell. The other sailor recovered.|$|E

During Georgia and Kyle's joint hen and bucks night, Chris is punched by an unseen assailant and he hits his head. Kyle and Georgia find him and he is rushed to hospital, and placed in an induced coma. Josh later confesses to punching Chris. When Chris wakes up, he struggles to remember words and <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> is weakened. Chris is allowed leave from the hospital to attend Georgia and Kyle's wedding. After he is discharged from hospital, Nate becomes Chris's carer. Chris decides to return to work at the garage but is unable to do the work and is sent home.

40|$|BackgroundHistologically {{confirmed}} meningiomas {{in first}} year of life are quite rare. However, review of the sporadic cases in the literature reported meningioma in infants. Those have unique features in common. Case presentationAn 11 month-old Iranian male infant presented with a several weeks history of decrease in movement of <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>sided</b> upper and lower extremities. Brain MRI revealed a large well-defined extra axial, Dural-based mass lesion, which is contained solid and cystic components. It is originated from falx, and showed intense contrast enhancement. The patient underwent a central craniotomy. The mass was removed sub totally. Microscopic examination of the specimen revealed a meningioma. Radiotherapy was deferred because of the young age. Patient follow up at 4 months later showed that the child was well. ConclusionPediatric meningiomas show a higher frequency of cyst formation in compared with adult meningiomas. In addition, they show more frequent sarcomatous changes, which is male predominance. Absence of dural based attachment and higher incidence of intraventricular location were seen...|$|R

40|$|Spontaneous {{migration}} of retained bullets {{in the brain}} is a recognized rare complication of penetrating cranial gunshot wounds to the brain. The authors report one rare case in a 55 -year old male patient who presented with a penetrating cranial gunshot wound and a retained bullet. He had a dense right hemiplegia and expressive aphasia on admission. Skull x-ray confirmed the retained intracranial bullet, which on CT scan was located at the left parietal-occipital region. He was managed conservatively. A repeat CT scan 17 days post injury showed spontaneous {{migration of}} the bullet to the left occipital pole adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus and near to the Torcula Herophili. He had a remarkable improvement of <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>sided</b> weakness but had severe receptive and expressive language deficits. This case highlights the need {{to watch out for}} the occurrence of spontaneous migration of intracranial bullets after a penetrating cranial gunshot wound and when detected management decisions should be individualized...|$|R
