500|$|In 1985, two {{volunteer}} field collectors for The Banksia Atlas project, John and Lalage Falconer of Esperance, {{became convinced}} that there were three Banksia species rather than two at Point Culver. Returning to the locality on 9 January 1986, they collected leaves and old flowers of {{what they thought was}} an undescribed species. The specimens did indeed suggest that a new species had been discovered, but they were not sufficient for formal publication. [...] Early in May the following year, John Falconer drove over 2000 kilometres on unsealed tracks from Warburton to Point Culver and back again, in order to collect <b>fresh</b> <b>flowers</b> and fruit of the purported new species. Alex George then began preparing a formal description of the species. During his research, he discovered that Nelson's Toolinna Cove specimen was also referable to the undescribed species. In the absence of any genuine B.media specimens from Toolinna Cove, George inferred that only B.epica occurred there, and that Eyre must have sighted B.epica in 1841. In 1988, he published a formal description of the species, naming it Banksia epica in reference to the two [...] "epic" [...] journeys of Eyre and Falconer. Thus the species' full name is Banksia epica A.S.George. It was later established that both B.epica and B.media occur at Toolinna Cove.|$|E

The police asked guests to quietly pay their checks {{and leave the}} building; this took two hours. [...] In 1934, the Stork Club moved to 3 East 53rd Street, where it remained until it closed in October 1965. Billingsley's guest list for the 53rd Street opening consisted of people from Broadway and Park Avenue. [...] He sent out 1,000 invitations for Champagne and dinner. The women found much to like about the <b>fresh</b> <b>flowers</b> everywhere and the mirrored walls, while the men were pleased to see their favorite dishes on the club's menu {{as well as many}} of their personal and business friends at the opening. When the Stork Club became a tenant in 1934, the building was known as the Physicians and Surgeons Building. Many of the medical tenants were unhappy about the night club moving in, but in February 1946, Billingsley purchased the seven-story building for $300,000 cash, evicting the doctors to expand the club.|$|E
