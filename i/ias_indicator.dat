40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of a very bright type Ia supernova, SNLS- 03 D 3 bb (≡ SN 2003 fg), in the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) has {{raised the question of}} whether super-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf stars are needed to explain such explosions. In principle, such a progenitor could form by the mergers of two rather massive white dwarfs. Binary systems of two white dwarfs in close orbit where their total mass significantly exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass, have not yet been found. Therefore SNLS- 03 D 3 bb could establish the first clear case of a double-degenerate progenitor of a (peculiar) type Ia supernovae. Moreover, if this interpretation is correct, it casts some doubt on the universality of the calibration relations used to make SNe <b>Ia</b> distance <b>indicators</b> for cosmology. Here we present a critical discussion of the expected observational finger prints of super-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions; in important respects, these are not consistent with the observations of SNLS- 03 D 3 bb.

Recent years have seen a brisk development of astrophysical models which explain SNe Ia as thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars.

Three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations allowed to study a wide variety of possibilities involving subsonic flame propagation (deflagrations), flames accelerated by turbulence, and supersonic detonations. These possibilities lead to a variety of scenarios.

40|$|The use of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe <b>Ia)</b> as {{distance}} <b>indicators</b> {{relies on}} the calibration of their brightness using the observed property that brighter SNe have broader, slower light curves. Among possible causes are different masses of the progenitor white dwarfs or different opacities. We construct Chandrasekhar-mass models which synthesize different amounts of Ni- 56, and compute their bolometric light curves and spectra. Since opacity in SNe Ia at early times is due mostly to spectral lines, and Fe-peak ions have many more lines than lighter ions, the opacity depends on the synthesized Ni- 56 mass and on {{the temperature in the}} ejecta. Bolometric light curves computed using these prescriptions reproduce the relation between brightness and decline rate. The synthetic spectra compare well with spectra of spectroscopically normal SNe Ia which cover a similar Deltam(15) (B) range. The change in colour of the spectra between maximum and two weeks later allows the observed relation between M-B(Max) and Deltam(15) (B) to be reproduced...|$|R

In order to calculate the IGF, GIS analysis, photo interpretation, historical data collection and geomorphological fieldwork were integrated.

EIP deployment is driven by several potential benefits, i. e., improvement of IAs opera-tional performance (increase of end product output), improvement of <b>IAs</b> economic <b>indicators</b> (increase of revenues) and decrease of IAs exposure to external risks (leading to energy/material supply shutdowns). How-ever, gain of these benefits depend on IAs internal and operational conditions, and other factors.

40|$|International audienceIn this study, the {{performance}} of nine widely used and accessible crop growth simulation models (APES-ACE, CROPSYST, DAISY, DSSAT-CERES, FASSET, HERMES, MONICA, STICS and WOFOST) was compared during 44 growing seasons of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) at seven sites in Northern and Central Europe. The aims of this model comparison were to examine how different process-based crop models perform at multiple sites across Europe when applied with minimal information for model calibration of spring barley at field scale, whether individual models perform better than the multi-model mean, and what the uncertainty ranges are in simulated grain yields. The reasons for differences among the models and how results for barley compare to winter wheat are discussed. Regarding yield estimation, best performing based on the {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) were models HERMES, MONICA and WOFOST with lowest values of 1124, 1282 and 1325 (kg ha − 1), respectively. Applying the index of agreement (IA), models WOFOST, DAISY and HERMES scored best having highest values (0. 632, 0. 631 and 0. 585, respectively). Most models systematically underestimated yields, whereby CROP-SYST showed the highest deviation as indicated by the mean bias error (MBE) (− 1159 kg ha − 1). While the wide range of simulated yields across all sites and years shows the high uncertainties in model estimates with only restricted calibration, mean predictions from the nine models agreed well with observations. Results of this paper also show that models that were more accurate in predicting phenology were not necessarily the ones better estimating grain yields. Total above-ground biomass estimates often did not follow the patterns of grain yield estimates and, thus, harvest indices were also different. Estimates of soil moisture dynamics varied greatly. In comparison, even though the growing cycle for winter wheat is several months longer than for spring barley, using RMSE and <b>IA</b> as <b>indicators,</b> models performed slightly, but not significantly, better in predicting wheat yields. Errors in reproducing crop phenology were similar, which in conjunction with the shorter growth cycle of barley has higher effects on accuracy in yield prediction...|$|R
40|$|SNe Ia {{are good}} {{distance}} indicators because {{the shape of}} their light curves, which can be measured independently of distance, varies smoothly with luminosity. This suggests that SNe Ia are a single family of events. Similar correlations are observed between luminosity and spectral properties. In particular, {{the ratio of the}} strengths of the SiII λ 5972 and λ 6355 lines, known as R(SiII), was suggested as a potential luminosity indicator. Here, the physical reasons for the observed correlation are investigated. A Monte-Carlo code is used to construct a sequence of synthetic spectra resembling those of SNe with different luminosities near B maximum. The influence of abundances and of ionisation and excitation conditions on the synthetic spectral features is investigated. The ratio R(SiII) depends ssentially on the strength of SiII λ 5972, because SiII λ 6355 is saturated. In less luminous objects, SiII λ 5972 is stronger because of a rapidly increasing SiII/SiIII ratio. Thus, the correlation between R(SiII) and luminosity is the effect of ionisation balance. The SiII λ 5972 line itself may be the best spectroscopic luminosity <b>indicator</b> for SNe <b>Ia,</b> but all <b>indicators</b> discussed show scatter which may be related to abundance distributions.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{properties}} of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) as functions of the radial distance from their host galaxy centers. Using a sample of 62 SNe Ia with reliable luminosity, reddening, and decline rate determinations, we find no significant radial gradients of SNe Ia peak absolute magnitudes or decline rates in elliptical+S 0 galaxies, suggesting that the diversity of SN properties {{is not related to}} the metallicity of their progenitors. We do find that the range in brightness and light curve width of supernovae in spiral galaxies extends to brighter, broader values. These results are interpreted as support for an age, but not metallicity, related origin of the diversity in SNe Ia. If confirmed with a larger and more accurate sample of data, the age-luminosity relation would offer a new and powerful tool to probe the ages and age gradients of stellar populations in galaxies at redshift as high as z ∼ 1 − 2. The absence of significant radial gradients in the peak (B−V) 0 and (V −I) 0 colors of SNe Ia supports the redding correction method of Phillips et al. (1999).

We construct fiducial NIR templates for normal SNe Ia from our sample, excluding only the three known peculiar SNe Ia: SN 2005 bl, SN 2005 hk, and SN 2005 ke. The H-band absolute magnitudes in this sample of 18 SNe Ia have an intrinsic rms of only 0. 15 mag with no correction for light-curve shape. We found {{a relationship between the}} H-band extinction and optical color excess of AH 0 : 2 E(B V).

40|$|Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) tools, {{allowing}} {{communication among}} users {{by means of}} networked computers, {{for the purpose of}} discussing topics of mutual interest, are actually used in educational, working or every day life contexts. In particular, asynchronous discussion forae are nowadays widely used in formal or informal educational contexts, applying principles of constructivism, emphasizing in social interaction during learning activities. Recently, research is focusing towards finding methods for the evolvement and support of critical thinking through interactions, taking place within asynchronous discussions, thus achieving high quality learning. Such a goal requires tools, frameworks and methods for the facilitation of monitoring and/or self-reflection and therefore self-regulation that could be supported by the automated analysis of the complex interactions that occur. D. I. A. S. (Discussion Interaction Analysis System) is a discussion forum with integrated supporting tools, which tries to meet these goals by applying Computer based Interaction Analysis (IA) techniques, taking into account quantitative usage data. IA is a recently emerged research field, mainly due to the complexity of interactions occurring within collaborative systems. The IA results are presented directly to technology based activities’ participants in an appropriate format (graphical, numerical, literal), interpretable by them, and to the activity observers, in order to analyze the complex cognitive and social phenomena that may occur. This approach can produce flexible <b>IA</b> tools (<b>indicators),</b> which in an educational context support directly the learning activities’ participants or even observers, in three major levels: awareness, metacognition and evaluation. The expected outcome is the optimization of the activity through: a) better design, regulation, coordination and evaluation by the moderator, and b) refined participation and learning outcome for the students through reflection, self-assessment and self-regulation. The research results show that the indicators clearly affect the participants’ behavior, operating as an additional motive, thus increasing participation ratio. Collaboration and therefore dialogue improvement has been noticed, as a result of participation refinement. Learners tend to participate in more discussion threads, interact with more collaborators and take more initiative within the discussions. They seem to better understand the structure and the goals of the discussion learing activity. More complex diagrams, with potentially increased underlying explanatory power seem to provide a more insightful examination of a discussion’s status and evolvement, as well as the contribution and performance of the participants (as individuals or as groups). Furthermore, new meanings can be derived by combining indicators’ information, thus producing Interpretative Schemas. Teachers as moderators and researchers as observers take advantage of such schemas, while trying to evaluate and preliminarily assess discussions and/or user performance (both in individual and group level). ...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{institutional}} architecture (IA), {{one of the}} two main themes of the Earth Summit, is important for sustainable development (SD). The IA not only has global importance for governance, but also has importance for national and regional governances. Proper governance is needed in developing, monitoring and implementing policies that are needed to meet the three pillars – social, environmental and economic of SD. After the establishment of a global level institution – the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) in 1972 {{as a result of the}} Stockholm Conference, and the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) in 1992 following the Rio Earth Summit – many countries have expressed their commitments to develop strong IA within their administrative network to attain the goals of SD. Arguments are that strong IA framework is needed to halt or reverse global environmental degradation. Critics, however, say that there are overlapping and competing claims than collaborating mandates between the UNEP and CSD to meet the goals of SD. Nonetheless, none has undermined the importance of IA to achieve the goals of SD. The importance of IA has increased further after the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002 to attain the goals of SD for the 21 st century. However, despite the action oriented approaches of WSSD for global and regional partnerships, many countries have failed to deliver needful changes within their IA. Research scholars question if IA is not well established, how would countries meet the standard of Rio+ 20 for delivering SD objectives. Reviewing the status of IA from four South Asian countries – Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan – from published literature and government portals and analyzing secondary data, this paper evaluates the strengths and weakness of IA of these countries. These four South Asian countries have expressed their repeated commitments to institutionalize services needed to achieve the goals of SD, however, our analyses of the <b>IA’s</b> performance <b>indicators</b> do not justify their claims. An analysis of four major indicators – Environmental Performance Index (EPI), the Global Competitiveness Index (GPI), Human Development Index (HDI) and Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) – within the framework of SD suggests that all four countries have different levels of social, economic and environmental foundations. However, all countries are competing to attain international conferences, signing and ratifying major multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), and claiming to achieve the goals of SD. Though these countries claim to have designed policies, laws, and administrative organizations to meet the requirements of MEAs, weak performance indicators suggest need for further investigation of IA performances. This investigation will reveal whether repeated commitments in papers, mere participations in various conferences, signing treaties, and creating IA to draw international aids are enough or there are other factors that inhibit countries from achieving the goals of SD...|$|R

We model the optical extinction and X-ray scattering properties of intergalactic dust grains to constrain the intergalactic opacity using a combined analysis of observed quasar colours and measurements of the soft X-ray background. We place upper limits on the extinction AB(z = 1) < 0. 10 - 0. 25 mag, and the dust density parameter Ωdust <  10 − 5 − 10 − 4  (ρgrain/ 3 g cm− 3), for models with RV <  12 − ∞, respectively. Dust in the host galaxies, and dust that may reside in the circumstellar (CS) environment, have important implications for the observed colours of SNe Ia. Using the Hubble Space Telescope and several ground based telescopes, we measure the extinction law, from UV to NIR, for a sample of six nearby SNe Ia. The SNe span a range of E(B − V) ≈  0. 1 − 1. 4 mag and RV  ≈  1. 5 − 2. 7, showing a diversity of dust extinction parameters. We present mid- and far-infrared (IR) observations for a number of SNe Ia, obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory and Spitzer Space Telescope, addressing CS dust as an explanation for “peculiar” extinction towards some SNe Ia. No excess IR emission is detected, limiting CS dust masses, Mdust <  10 − 5  solar masses. In particular, the timely appearance of SN 2014 J in M 82 - the closest SN Ia in several decades - allows for detailed studies, across an unprecedented wavelength range, of its lightcurve and spectral evolution along with the host galaxy and CS environment.

40|$|The Supernova Acceleration Probe (SNAP) {{will use}} Type Ia supernovae (SNe <b>Ia)</b> as {{distance}} <b>indicators</b> {{to measure the}} effect of dark energy on the expansion history of the Universe. (SNAP's weak-lensing program is described in a separate White Paper.) The experiment exploits supernova distance measurements up to their fundamental systematic limit; strict requirements on the monitoring of each supernova's properties leads {{to the need for}} a space-based mission. Results from pre-SNAP experiments, which characterize fundamental SN Ia properties, will be used to optimize the SNAP observing strategy to yield data, which minimize both systematic and statistical uncertainties. With early R&D funding, we have achieved technological readiness and the collaboration is poised to begin construction. Pre-JDEM AO R&D support will further reduce technical and cost risk. Specific details on the SNAP mission can be found in Aldering et al. (2004, 2005). The primary goal of the SNAP supernova program is to provide a dataset which gives tight constraints on parameters which characterize the dark-energy, e. g. w{sub 0 } and w{sub a} where w(a) = w{sub 0 } + w{sub a}(1 -a). SNAP data {{can also be used to}} directly test and discriminate among specific dark energy models. We will do so by building the Hubble diagram of high-redshift supernovae, the same methodology used in the original discovery of the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe that established the existence of dark energy (Perlmutter et al. 1998; Garnavich et al. 1998; Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999). The SNAP SN Ia program focuses on minimizing the systematic floor of the supernova method through the use of characterized supernovae that can be sorted into subsets based on subtle signatures of heterogeneity. Subsets may be defined based on host-galaxy morphology, spectral-feature strength and velocity, early-time behavior, inter alia. Independent cosmological analysis of each subset of ''like'' supernovae can be compared to give confidence that the results are free from significant systematics. Conversely, analysis between supernova subsets at the same redshift can identify further systematics controls. While theories of the supernova progenitor and explosion mechanism can guide the establishment of subset criteria, such understanding is not required [...] only comprehensive measurements are [...] for robustness of the cosmological results. The level of robustness is tied to the quality of data with which supernovae are distinguished. Statistical mission requirements are fundamentally bound by the systematic limitations of the experiment...|$|R
