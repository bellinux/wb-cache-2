Just then, Tenpenny appears, holds CJ at gunpoint and steals Big Smoke's money, intending to use it to leave the city. Tenpenny escapes and CJ and Sweet pursue him. During the pursuit, Tenpenny loses control of a fire truck that he was using as a getaway vehicle, driving off the bridge over the Grove Street cul-de-sac and crashing at the entrance to it.

25|$|Strabo, giving {{credits to}} Metrodorus of Scepsis and Hypsicrates, {{mentions}} that at his time the Amazons {{were believed to}} live on the borders of the Gargareans. There were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would <b>go</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargareans to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own, regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty. He also stated that the Gargarians went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.|$|E

500|$|It is {{possible}} that when Ceawlin and Cuthwine took Bath, they found the Roman baths still operating to some extent. [...] Nennius, a ninth-century historian, mentions a [...] "Hot Lake" [...] {{in the land of}} the Hwicce, which was along the Severn, and adds [...] "It is surrounded by a wall, made of brick and stone, and men may <b>go</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> bathe at any time, and every man can have the kind of bath he likes. [...] If he wants, it will be a cold bath; and if he wants a hot bath, it will be hot". [...] Bede also describes hot baths in the geographical introduction to the Ecclesiastical History in terms very similar to those of Nennius.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the villain}} {{of the episode}} [...] "Hell House" [...] has supernatural origins, {{the basis of the}} story came from a {{situation}} writer Trey Callaway had as a child; he and his friends created a fake murder scene in an abandoned barn and then convinced their friends that killings occurred there. The children would often <b>go</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> scare each other, with one girl running away and breaking her leg after believing that she saw an attacking ghost. The human antagonists of [...] "The Benders", however, were completely devoid of supernatural elements. Shiban made this decision not only to surprise the audience, but also to have the Winchesters face something they had never encountered before. For [...] "Nightmare", Tucker tried to write the character Max as sympathetic, and thus had difficulties in deciding how to end the episode. The writers eventually decided to have him kill himself to prevent him from doing more harm.|$|E
500|$|Bath {{may have}} been the site of the Battle of Badon (500 AD), in which King Arthur is said to have {{defeated}} the Anglo-Saxons. The town was captured by the West Saxons in 577 after the Battle of Deorham; the Anglo-Saxon poem The Ruin may describe the appearance of the Roman site about this time. A monastery was founded at an early date– reputedly by Saint David although more probably in 675 by Osric, King of the Hwicce, perhaps using the walled area as its precinct. Nennius, a 9th-century historian, mentions a [...] "Hot Lake" [...] {{in the land of the}} Hwicce along the River Severn, and adds [...] "It is surrounded by a wall, made of brick and stone, and men may <b>go</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> bathe at any time, and every man can have the kind of bath he likes. If he wants, it will be a cold bath; and if he wants a hot bath, it will be hot". Bede described hot baths in the geographical introduction to the Ecclesiastical History in terms very similar to those of Nennius. King Offa of Mercia gained control of the monastery in 781 and rebuilt the church, which was dedicated to St. Peter.|$|E
