A total of 20 <b>intermittent</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> was attempted and its results were discussed. An average decrease of 18. 1 mg/dl of serum urea-N, 2. 5 mg/dl of serum creatinine, 1. 0 mEq/L of serum potassium and 2. 7 mEq/L of serum phosphorus were found with one course of <b>intermittent</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis.</b> The average number of frequency, duration of dialysis and amount of solution used per one course were 16 times, 31 hours and 19 liters respectively.

40|$|Dialytic {{intervention}} for {{infants and children}} with acute kidney injury (AKI) can take many forms. Whether patients are treated by <b>intermittent</b> hemodialysis, <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> or continuous renal replacement therapy depends on specific patient characteristics.

We investigated {{the effect of}} dialysate dwell on GET by studying the subjects twice: once without dialysate in the abdomen (drained) and once with 2 L of dialysate in the abdomen (full). We also investigated the relationship between body surface area (BSA) and delayed gastric emptying [...] Results:(1) The mean gastric emptying rate in 120 minutes in patients on CAPO when drained (67. 8 % &# 177; 13. 4 %) was not different from that in controls (65. 4 % &# 177; 8. 6 %).

40|$|Introduction: End Stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) {{is a major}} public health problem across the world and it is rising. The {{incidence}} prevalence and causes of ESRD is not known in Nepal. With a population of 27 million people the estimated incidence of ESRD is around 2700 /year if we take 100 /million population at par with India and Pakistan. However majority of patients do not reach hospitals with dialysis facilities. The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze the clinico-epidemiological profile of ESRD in the Nepalese context. Methods: A retrospective, cross sectional study was conducted on newly diagnosed ESRD patients within fi ve years in a tertiary care center. Their demographic profi le, etiology and follow up were studied. Results: The mean age of the patients was 42 years, male to female ratio being 1. 7 : 1. Chronic glomerulonephritis (41 %) was the leading cause of ESRD, followed by diabetic nephropathy (16. 8 %) and hypertensive nephrosclerosis (13. 7 %). Unexplained renal failure constituted 18 % of our cases. <b>Intermittent</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> (IPD) remained the initial mode of therapy due to easy accessibility. Most of the patients dropped out after having single session of IPD. Others went for repeat sessions of IPD or haemodialysis. Out of the 23. 6 % who went for haemodialysis only 13 % could continue dialysis for more than three months and 3. 8 % could go to neighboring country for renal transplantation. Conclusions: CGN is the leading cause of ESRD followed by diabetic nephropathy and hypertension. It affected younger age group people. ESRD treatment is costly and unaffordable by most Nepalese people. Stress should be given to the health education and screening programme for prevention and early detection of CKD.

D and L-Iactate were infused into the portal circulation of dogs and net hepatic uptake of both isomers measured by A-V sampling, blood flows being measured by flow probes. Hepatic extractions of both isomers were not significantly different. In three patients on <b>intermittent</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> (IPD), and three patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), arterial D-Iactate was less than 15 % of the concentration of Llactate {{at the end of}} treatment. In conclusion, D-Iactate is metabolized as effectively as L-Iactate. KEY WORDS: D-Iactate metabolism; L-Iactate metabolism. S odium lactate, as a racemic mixture of the D and L isomers, is widely used in clinical medicine as an alkalinizing agent and is the base provided in commercial peritoneal fluid dialysate. Evidence exists that the D isomer cannot be metabolized as efficiently as the L isomer in the rat (1), the dog (2), sheep (3), and in man (4, 5). In contrast, D-lactate does not accumulate in the body in patients on <b>intermittent</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> (IPD) (6) or hemodialysis with lactate as base (7). Although the liver is the major organ for removal of lactate in the body, there are no published data on hepatic metabolism of both isomers in vivo.
