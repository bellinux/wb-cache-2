40|$|Many {{metal parts}} {{manufacturers}} use large metal presses to shape sheet metal into finished products like car body parts, jet wing and fuselage surfaces, etc. These metal presses take sheet metal and - with enormous force - reshape the metal into a fully formed {{part in a}} manner of seconds. Although highly efficient, the forces involved in forming metal parts also damage the press itself, limit the metals used in part production, slow press operations and, when not properly controlled, cause the manufacture of large volumes of defective metal parts. To date, the metal-forming industry {{has not been able to}} develop a metal-holding technology that allows full control of press forces during the part forming process. This is of particular importance in the automotive lightweighting efforts under way in the US automotive manufacturing marketplace. Metalforming Controls Technology Inc. (MC 2) has developed a patented press control system called the <b>Force</b> <b>Modulator</b> that has the ability to control these press forces, allowing a breakthrough in stamping process control. The technology includes a series of hydraulic cylinders that provide controlled tonnage at all points in the forming process. At the same time, the unique cylinder design allows for the generation of very high levels of clamping forces (very high tonnages) in very small spaces; a requirement for forming medium and large panels out of HSS and AHSS. Successful production application of these systems testing at multiple stamping operations - including Ford and Chrysler - has validated the capabilities and economic benefits of the system. Although this technology has been adopted in a number of stamping operations, one of the primary barriers to faster adoption and application of this technology in HSS projects is system cost. The cost issue has surfaced because the systems currently in use are built for each individual die as a custom application, thus driving higher tooling costs. This project proposed to better marry the die-specific <b>Force</b> <b>Modulator</b> technology with stamping presses in the form of a press cushion. This system would be designed to operate the binder ring for multiple parts, thus cutting the per-die cost of the technology. This study reports the results of technology field application. This project produced the following conclusions: (1) The <b>Force</b> <b>Modulator</b> system is capable of operating at very high tempos in the stamping environment; (2) The company can generate substantial, controlled holding tonnage (binder ring pressure) necessary to hold high strength steel parts for proper formation during draw operations; (3) A single system can be designed to operate with a family of parts, thus significantly reducing the per-die cost of a FM system; (4) High strength steel parts made with these systems appear to show significant quality improvements; (5) The amounts of steel required to make these parts is typically less than the amounts required with traditional blank-holding technologies; and (6) This technology will aid in the use of higher strength steels in auto and truck production, thus reducing weight and improving fuel efficiency...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} salient {{features of}} human–human interaction where one person with limited auditory and visual {{perception of the}} environment (a follower) is guided by an agent with full perceptual capabilities (a guider) via a hard rein along a given path. We investigate several salient features {{of the interaction between}} the guider and follower such as: 1) the order of an autoregressive (AR) control policy that maps states of the follower to actions of the guider; 2) how the guider may modulate the pulling force in response to the trust level of the follower; and 3) how learning may successively apportion the responsibility of control across different muscles of the guider. Based on experimental systems identification on human demonstrations from ten pairs of naive subjects, we show that guiders tend to adopt a third-order AR predictive control policy and followers tend to adopt second-order reactive control policy. Moreover, the extracted guider’s control policy was implemented and validated by human–robot interaction experiments. By modeling the follower’s dynamics with a time varying virtual damped inertial system, we found that it is the coefficient of virtual damping which is most sensitive to the trust level of the follower. We used these experimental insights to derive a novel controller that integrates an optimal order control policy with a push/pull <b>force</b> <b>modulator</b> in response to the trust level of the follower monitored using a time varying virtual damped inertial model...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the idea to develop the {{integrated}} model of offshore gangway model including multi-body dynamics model and hydraulic system model with bond-graph method in 20 -sim. And based on that model, active motion compensation control approach will developed in order to compensate the ship motion during gangway operation and further more a parallel position and force control method will be proposed to make the gangway tip maintain constant contact force with windmill platform as well as compensate ship motion during transferring process. In order to get reasonable data for modeling, simulation and control of gangway operation, an offshore gangway was designed first based on the relative rules and existing products from Uptime Company. Then multi-body dynamic model is developed with IC-field based on the Lagrangian Hamiltonian equation of gangway. After that, the hydraulic system for gangway was designed and verified with simulation. Based on this developed model, the control algorithm for active motion control and parallel position and force control were proposed. The active heave compensation control {{is based on}} the kinematics solving method to mapping the gangway tip trajectory to actuator trajectory and then control the actuator by position and velocity feedback with velocity feedforward controller. And the parallel position and force control was based on the inner positon loop outer force control and the idea is to adjust the desired gangway tip trajectory by the <b>force</b> <b>modulator</b> to achieve the desired contact force...|$|E

Activation at the myosin motor domain via phosphorylated myosin light chain (phospho-MLC) remains the primary signal to initiate contraction, but it is now appreciated that there are additional <b>force</b> <b>modulators</b> also present in smooth muscle. One particularly well studied modulatory protein is Caldesmon (CaD), which has been implicated in controlling contractile force in vascular smooth muscle, however little is known of CaD's physiological role in vivo.

40|$|Unaccustomed {{lengthening}} contractions {{have been}} shown to impair muscle function - however little is known regarding this impairment on muscle power - specifically, the velocity component of power during voluntary contractions in humans. The four studies presented in my thesis investigated power-loss following lengthening contractions in healthy young and old women and young men. The purpose of Study 1 was to determine reliability of velocity-dependent power of the dorsiflexors using the isotonic mode of the Biodex Dynamometer. I determined the isotonic mode is reliable and can be used to track changes in velocity and power following fatigue and lengthening contractions. The purpose of Study 2 was to investigate changes in neuromuscular properties of the ankle dorsiflexors during and following repetitive lengthening contractions and throughout recovery in 21 (10 men, and, 11 women) recreationally active young adults (25. 8 ± 2. 3 y). The protocol for the following 3 studies involves subjects performing 5 sets of 30 lengthening contractions, with neuromuscular measures (i. e., electrically evoked twitch, tetanus, voluntary activation, voluntary contractions) recorded at baseline, during the task, and throughout recovery. Exercise induced muscle damage ultimately led to velocity-dependent (i. e., isotonic) power loss at a moderate load (i. e., 20 % maximum voluntary strength). Compared with isometric and isokinetic tasks, less is known regarding velocity-dependent muscle power and recovery in older adults following repeated lengthening contractions. In Study 3 we tested 9 old (68. 3 ± 6. 1 y) and 9 young women (25. 1 ± 1. 3 y). Old were more impaired following the task than young as shown by greater low-frequency torque depression at task termination leading to a more pronounced initial loss of power than young. However, power remained reduced in both groups during the 30 min recovery period. Older women were more susceptible to power loss than young following lengthening contractions likely owing to a greater fatigue response. In Study 4, power curves were constructed [8 men (27 ± 3 y), 8 women (26 ± 4 y) ] using various isotonic loads before and following task termination. There was a preferential loss of power at higher loads, with a relative maintenance of maximal shortening velocity shifting the power curve down and leftward. When stressed with heavier loads during dynamic contractions, <b>force</b> <b>modulators</b> arranged in parallel seem to be affected more by damage than those organized in series (velocity), which was highlighted by the attenuation of power at higher versus lower resistances. The main findings of my thesis are that repetitive lengthening contractions fatigued and temporarily weakened the dorsiflexors, thus impairing their power producing ability immediately (i. e., fatigue + weakness) and longer term (i. e., weakness) owing to an inability to generate torque rapidly...|$|R

Using extensive live imaging analysis, we show that disrupting CaD function within intestinal smooth muscle can significantly increase GI motility, with and without phospho-MLC, highlighting CaD 2 ̆ 7 s ability to independently modulate contractile force. In addition, previous work on a mutant, meltdown (mlt), in our lab has uncovered a smooth muscle myosin (myh 11) mutation leading to increased contractile force and premature CaD phosphorylation. Interestingly, in the mlt mutant intestinal epithelial invasion was observed pointing to the unique role for force propagation in initiating cell invasion. We show that CaD is necessary for mlt epithelial invasion to occur, as knockdown of CaD causes the invasive phenotype in heterozygous mlt, which otherwise appear wild type. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the crosstalk between muscle contraction and epithelial invasion, we performed a genetic screen for modifier mutants of the mlt phenotype. From the screen, we discovered two enhancer mutants of mlt that contained missense mutations in unique protein domains of MYH 11 that alter the contractile function of smooth muscle. These mutations (S 237 Y and L 1287 M) occur in both the motor domain and helical tail domain of the protein, suggesting that alterations in distinct regions of myosin can result in abnormal contraction and potentially lead to invasion in underlying cells. Since a number of myosin mutations have been implicated in vascular disease and colon cancer, these studies provide insight into the diversity and mechanistic consequences of mutated myosin in altering smooth muscle contraction and epithelial cell invasion. ...|$|R
40|$|Seventy-five {{percent of}} {{patients}} with epithelial ovarian cancer present with advanced-stage disease that is extensively disseminated intraperitoneally and prognosticates the poorest outcomes. Primarily metastatic within the abdominal cavity, ovarian carcinomas initially spread to adjacent organs by direct extension and then disseminate via the transcoelomic route to distant sites. Natural fluidic streams of malignant ascites triggered by physiological factors, including gravity and negative subdiaphragmatic pressure, carry metastatic cells throughout the peritoneum. We investigated the role of fluidic <b>forces</b> as <b>modulators</b> of metastatic cancer biology in a customizable microfluidic platform using 3 D ovarian cancer nodules. Changes in the morphological, genetic, and protein profiles of biomarkers associated with aggressive disease were evaluated in the 3 D cultures grown under controlled and continuous laminar flow. A modulation of biomarker expression and tumor morphology consistent with increased epithelial–mesenchymal transition, a critical step in metastatic progression and an indicator of aggressive disease, is observed because of hydrodynamic forces. The increase in epithelial–mesenchymal transition is driven {{in part by a}} posttranslational up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and activation, which is associated with the worst prognosis in ovarian cancer. A flow-induced, transcriptionally regulated decrease in E-cadherin protein expression and a simultaneous increase in vimentin is observed, indicating increased metastatic potential. These findings demonstrate that fluidic streams induce a motile and aggressive tumor phenotype. The microfluidic platform developed here potentially provides a flow-informed framework complementary to conventional mechanism-based therapeutic strategies, with broad applicability to other lethal malignancies.

40|$|Mechanical <b>forces</b> are {{ubiquitous}} <b>modulators</b> of cell activity {{but little}} is known about the mechanical stresses in the cell. Genetically encoded FRET-based force sensors now allow the measurement of local stress in specific host proteins in vivo in real time. For a minimally invasive probe, we designed one with a mechanical compliance matching that of many common cytoskeleton proteins. sstFRET is a cassette composed of Venus and Cerulean linked by a spectrin repeat. The stress sensitivity of the probe was measured in solution using DNA springs to push the donor and acceptor apart with 5 – 7 pN and this produced large changes in FRET. To measure cytoskeletal stress in vivo we inserted sstFRET into α-actinin and expressed it in HEK and BAEC cells. Time-lapse imaging showed the presence of stress gradients in time and space, often uncorrelated with obvious changes in cell shape. The gradients could be rapidly relaxed by thrombin-induced cell contraction associated with inhibition of myosin II. The tension in actinin fluctuated rapidly (scale of seconds) illustrating a cytoskeleton in dynamic equilibrium. Stress in the cytoskeleton can be driven by macroscopic stresses applied to the cell. Using sstFRET as a tool to measure internal stress, we tested the prediction that osmotic pressure increases cytoskeletal stress. As predicted, hypotonic swelling increased the tension in actinin, confirming the model derived from AFM. Anisotonic stress also produced a novel transient (~ 2 minutes) decrease in stress upon exposure to a hypotonic challenge, matched by a transient increase with hypertonic stress. This suggests that, at rest, the stress axis of actinin is not parallel to the stress axis of actin and that swelling can reorient actinin to lie more parallel where it can absorb a larger fraction of the total stress. Protein stress sensors are opening new perspectives in cell biology...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 Mechanical <b>forces</b> are {{important}} <b>modulators</b> of cellular function in various tissues and {{are particularly important}} in the cardiovascular system. The endothelial cell layer, {{by virtue of its}} unique location in the vessel wall, is exposed to fluid forces of much greater magnitude than those experienced by other mammalian tissues and thus has developed mechanically-related responses to fluid shear stress. While the effects of shear on endothelial cell function have been well studied, the mechanisms by which endothelial cells sense mechanical stimuli and convert them to biochemical signals are not well characterized. The primary goal of this project is to study the intracellular signal transduction mechanisms activated by fluid shear stress. In this dissertation, we (1) detail the construction and characterize the efficacy of different apparatus to simulate shear stress in vitro on cultured cells; (2) demonstrate that PKC is involved in the shear stress-mediated ERK 1 / 2 activation as well as characterize PKC-ε as the necessary isoform for this signaling pathway; (3) characterize the ion dependency of shear stress-mediated ERK 1 / 2 activation and show that sodium entry is inhibitory; and (4) identify and characterize mechanosensitive voltage-gated sodium channels in endothelial cells that are involved in the ERK 1 / 2 response to shear stress. The results will allow us to define temporal and functional interactions of endothelial cell signaling mechanisms with shear stress and allow us to characterize their contribution to the modulation of endothelial cell function by hemodynamic forces. This knowledge is important not only {{to our understanding of the}} pathogenesis of atherosclerosis but also to a wide variety of biological processes that are modulated by physical forces, such as bone growth, muscle hypertrophy, hair cell sound transduction...|$|R
40|$|Degeneration of the {{intervertebral}} disc {{is the main}} pathophysiological process implicated in low back pain and is a prerequisite to disc herniation. Clinically, mechanical <b>forces</b> are important <b>modulators</b> of the degeneration, but the underlying molecular mechanism is not known and needs investigation to identify the biological target. The aim of this work was to study, at the molecular level, the effects of cyclic tensile stretch (CTS) on the production of proteoglycan by {{intervertebral disc}} annulus fibrosus cells since proteoglycans seem to be implicated in the dynamic process of intervertebral disc degeneration. Such cells of rabbit were cultured at high density on plates with a flexible bottom. CTS was applied with use of a pressure-operated instrument to deform the plates. With CTS at 1 % elongation (1 Hz frequency), the level of 35 S-labeled neosynthesized proteoglycans that accumulated in the cellular pool or were secreted in the culture medium did not change, but at 5 % elongation, the level was significantly reduced after 8 h of stimulation (30 and 21 %, respectively) and further reduced at 24 h (43 and 41 %, respectively). Introducing the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide {{had no effect on}} this result. Neither aggrecan and biglycan expression nor proteoglycan physical properties were modified. The level of nitrite oxide production significantly increased by 3. 5 times after 8 h of 5 % elongation. Introducing the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors NG-methyl-l-arginine or N-omega nitro-l-arginine diminished the effects of CTS on the production of nitrite oxide and proteoglycans. By contrast, introducing N-iminoethyl-l-lysine (a more specific inhibitor of inductible NOS [iNOS]) had little or no effect. Taken together, these results suggest that cNOS activation seems to be more implicated in the 5 % CTS modulation of proteoglycan production than iNOS activation. These results suggest that CTS can help regulate the intervertebral disc matrix by decreasing proteoglycan production through a post-translational regulation involving nitrite oxide. This result could be of interest in the development of local therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling intervertebral disc degeneration...|$|R
40|$|In the {{cardiovascular}} system, mechanical <b>forces</b> are important <b>modulators</b> of cell functions. Being in constant contact with blood flow, vascular endothelial cells (ECs) {{are sensitive to}} hemodynamic forces such as fluid shear stress. Cells in the straight part of the arterial tree are usually resistant to atheroma formation, while cells at vessel bifurcations are athero-prone. These differences in EC phenotype can be attributed mainly to region- specific mechanical forces, i. e., laminar high shear stress in the straight vessel versus disturbed low shear stress at bifurcation points. Among many genes and proteins that respond to fluid shear stress, KrüppelLike Factor 2 (KLF 2) is a transcription factor that can be induced by laminar flow. It has been noted that KLF 2 possesses several anti-thrombotic and atheroprotective characteristics {{similar to those of}} high laminar shear stress. In the current study, I focused on understanding the regulatory mechanisms of KLF 2 under pulsatile laminar flow (PS), and investigated its role in the flow-mediated atheroprotective functions. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was identified as an upstream signaling molecule that regulated KLF 2 induction by PS flow, and results of my collaborative studies linked AMPK to the previously known ERK 5 /MEF 2 pathway. Our findings provided a complete mechanistic explanation of KLF 2 regulation under PS flow via the AMPK/ERK 5 /MEF 2 pathway. In order to further elucidate the role of KLF 2 in the atheroprotective functions of PS flow, I used gene-silencing siRNA to block KLF 2 expression and examined its effects on PS flow- mediated cell anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory responses. My results suggested that KLF 2 induction was essential in keeping ECs in a quiescent and non- inflammatory state under PS flow, thus demonstrating KLF 2 's role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. Our investigation has provided new insights on the mechanism of how KLF 2 is regulated under the mechanical stimulation of PS flow. By manipulating the expression of KLF 2, I also gain understanding of the critical role it plays in PS flow-mediated cell functions. These observations identify KLF 2 as an important mechano-activated transcription factor that is necessary for the endothelium to remain in an athero-resistant state in the vasculatur...|$|R
