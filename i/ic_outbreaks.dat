40|$|The {{application}} of a recently described PCR test {{for the detection of}} Haemophilus paragallinarum in China is described. The test was used to examine a total of 127 chickens sourced from a challenge trial (38 chickens), a respiratory disease-free experimental chicken farm (50 chickens) and eight farms with suspect infectious coryza (<b>IC)</b> <b>outbreaks</b> (39 chickens). The PCR results were compared with traditional culture. The PCR detected 14 / 14 infected birds in the challenge trial as compared with 13 / 14 for culture. The 50 chickens from the disease-free experimental farm were all negative by both PCR and culture. PCR yielded 15 / 39 birds and 6 / 8 commercial farms positive as compared with 8 / 39 birds and 4 / 8 farms positive by culture. All farms positive by PCR had chickens showing the typical clinical signs of IC, indicating that culture failed to confirm coryza on two farms that had the typical clinical signs of the disease. Although chickens on two commercial farms were thought initially to be suffering from coryza, detailed clinical examination yielded no birds with typical clinical signs. The 12 chickens examined from these two farms were negative by both PCR and culture. The results suggest that the PCR test for H. paragallinarum is a suitable alternative to culture even under the typical field and laboratory conditions that operate in China...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{molecular}} {{epidemiological study}} of TB conducted in North Sardinia (Italy) by Micobacteriologyâ€™s laboratory (University of Sassari), demonstrated an interesting case of same-strain transmission among co-workers. Epidemiological information indicating possible links between 5 TB-patients, hospitalized in the Institute of Respiratory Disease (University of Sassari), were also available. The patients {{come from the}} same geographic area, and moreover they were co-workers and friends which met each other frequently. Case Report: Isolation, identification and Drug susceptibility testing of strains and IS 6110 -based RFLP analysis to demonstrate the same origin of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were performed in the Department of Biomedical Science, University of Sassari. All the strains were primary resistant to Isoniazid and Streptomicin and were genetically indistinguishable by direct comparison of the IS 6110 -patterns, that was constituted by 9 copies of the IS 6110 insertion element. Conclusions: The combination of cavitary disease, high MTB sputum concentration and close proximity resulted in a strong infecting capacity of the <b>IC</b> in this <b>outbreak,</b> while the environment and the clinical characteristics of each case were considered as the most important factors responsible for the variability in developing active TB...|$|R
