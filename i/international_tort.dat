40|$|The High Court {{recently}} clarified {{the choice}} of law rule which applies to <b>international</b> <b>torts,</b> which are now governed by {{the law of the}} place of the tort. Where the tort occurred abroad, {{the choice of}} law rule will require Australian courts to apply foreign law. The High Court did not specifically address whether a reference to foreign law means a reference to its internal law or to its choice of law rules - a problem which is addressed in private international law by the doctrine of renvoi. This problem arose directly in Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Australia) v Neilson. This note explains and critically evaluates the decision of the Full Court of Western Australia in this case.

40|$|This Article {{argues that}} the federal forum non conveniens {{doctrine}} subverts critical national interests in <b>international</b> <b>torts</b> cases. For over a quarter century, federal judges have assumed that foreign injury cases, particularly those filed by foreign plaintiffs, are best litigated abroad. This assumption is incorrect. Foreign injuries caused by multinational corporations who tap the American market implicate significant national interests in compensation and/or deterrence. Federal judges approach the forum non conveniens decision {{as if it were}} a species of choice of law, as opposed to a choice of forum question. Analyzing the cases from an adjudicatory perspective reveals that in the case of an American resident plaintiff injured abroad, an adequate alternative forum seldom exists; each time a federal court dismisses such a claim, the American interest in compensation is irrevocably impaired. With respect to deterrence, an analysis focusing properly on adjudicatory factors demonstrates that excluding foreign injury claims, even those brought by foreign plaintiffs, seriously undermines our national interest in deterring corporate malfeasance...|$|R
40|$|In Europe, {{uniform rules}} {{concerning}} <b>international</b> <b>tort</b> litigations {{are to be}} found, as to jurisdiction, in the general provisions of the Brussels Convention 1968 and, as to the designation of the national applicable law, in the Hague Convention of 1973 (for the area of product liability). In contrast {{to the field of}} contracts, in the field of torts no special protection is given to the consumer as such. Still, the solutions provided by the conventions are not inappropriate. For product liability claims, the Hague Convention tends to designate the law of the State with which the case is most closely connected. For ascertaining international jurisdiction in general, the Brussels Convention provides for three alternative fora, namely the place of the domicile of the defendant, the place of the tort, and the place of the damage. Due to important differences between the rules on jurisdiction and conflicts of laws in contracts and in torts, respectively, the crucial issues concern the qualification {{of the nature of the}} claim before the court...|$|E
40|$|The rise of privately {{enforceable}} {{rights in}} national courts based on substantive international law is an undeniable global phenomenon. Private rights are one {{response to the}} necessity of legal institutions to cope with globalisation. Moreover, the existence of privately enforceable rights is one more {{piece of evidence that}} the state-centred international system has undergone fundamental and irreversible change in the last 50 years. Privately enforceable rights and corresponding private duties based in substantive international law and enforceable in domestic courts are also evidence that monist theories of international law are empirically more correct than dualist theories. Finally, privately enforceable human rights undermine the claims of realism to primacy in international relations theory. Realism posits that international relations are fundamentally based on power politics and are zero sum. The rise of trading blocs, privatisation, and individual human rights all demonstrate the des-integration of the state due to globalisation and localisation and tend to invalidate the realists. For all these reasons, the issue of private law rights under international law is a timely topic. Our examination centres on one aspect of this complex of problems: the availability and limits of private law remedies to human rights violations – largely, torts. This thesis presents a comparative inquiry into those rights and duties based on international law recognized in national legal orders. Happily, and perhaps surprisingly, tort law can contribute to the defense of human rights. But that possibility is qualified by numerous serious limitations: procedurally, litigants usually invoke universal jurisdiction in cases of human rights violations heard in first world courts. Jurisdiction to adjudicate is usually accepted without problem. But precisely because certain violations of human rights are of universal concern there are numerous jurisdictional limitations on substantive rights while very real are not insurmountable. That is the principal contradiction of <b>international</b> <b>tort</b> law: the theoretical availability of universal rights, contradicted by the practical unavailability of relief, theoretically due to jurisdictional limitations, practically due to judgement proof defendants. The practical and procedural limitations are not however so great as to extinguish or obviate all human rights claims in private law...|$|E
40|$|Global {{terrorist}} activities require financial economic support {{and a way}} to combat terrorism is to limit access to such funding. Terrorist financing is a global problem which is closely linked to money laundering and requires a well-co-ordinated, multilateral response through International bodies, such as the United Nations Security Council, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) of the OECD, as well as the use of civil litigation by victims against terrorist groups and their sponsors. The proactive role of corporations, such as banks (cf. the US Arab Bank case) and other entities (cf. SNCB Securities), as well as individuals play as aiders and abettors in financing International terrorism is well known and documented. 1 This article aims to outline the evolving notion of corporate responsibility for human rights violations and acts of terrorism as a legal option for the individual victim of terrorism to achieve some form of justice.

Especially in light of the different nature of risks such as <b>international</b> cyber <b>torts</b> [38].

40|$|This was how {{the final}} morning {{in the life of}} Dr John Elliot was {{reported}} {{on the front page of}} the Sydney Morning Heraldin January 2007. Dr Elliot, from NSW, was gravely ill with multiple myeloma, and had travelled to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland for assisted suicide. About 200 people seek assisted suicide in Switzerland each year, including a cohort of foreign nationals, and a spokesman for Dignitas recently said that it has so far helped over 1, 000 foreigners to die. 2 Earlier this year, a referendum proposing a ban on both assisted suicide and so-called ‘suicide tourism’ was overwhelmingly rejected by voters in the Canton of Zurich, with 78 per cent of voters opposing the ban on euthanasia for foreigners. 3 In a magazine issue devoted to <b>international</b> <b>torts</b> and travel law – which for most people is associated with exploration, business opportunities, relaxation, the living of life – this article focuses on a type of travel that has come to be known, arrestingly, as ‘death tourism’. Of course, it is commonplace for people to find themselves travelling on death-related missions. Most such trips involve visiting a dying relative, attending a funeral, or visiting a grave. Some people travel to a special destination to suicide spectacularly. 4 Some will travel with the intention of importing a lethal medicine, such as the notorious barbiturate pentobarbital, 5 to facilitate a suicide at home. And every now and then, gravely ill people like Dr Elliott will seek to travel overseas for a life-ending procedure in one of the few jurisdictions where this is lawful. This article looks at the reasons why some people travel to die in these circumstances, what legal barriers might prevent more of us from doing the same, and whether recent developments in UK law might be re-played here, creating, if not a ‘right to die’, a right to travel to die without interference...|$|R

30|$|The second {{body of work}} {{focuses on}} {{investigating}} cyber insurance policies. Parts of insurance literature provide {{an analysis of the}} insurability of cyber risks using the KARTEN framework [35] and the Berliner insurability framework [36]. This analysis reveals that ‘Randomness of loss occurrence’ and ‘Information asymmetry’ are problematic aspects of cyber insurance. As ‘Information asymmetry’ relates to adverse selection and moral hazard, this supports the results of the first body of literature. In addition, this stream of literature considers gaps in traditional policies [37]. Legal scholarship reflects on the issue of tangible property and data [11] and whether liability covers <b>international</b> cyber <b>torts</b> [38]. Business literature investigates the role of insurance within a risk management strategy [39], how insurers deal with moral hazard [16] and the type of coverage available [4]. There is further work analysing cyber insurance policies to understand coverage offered. Six policies are examined by Baer et al. [12], 14 are analysed by Marotta et al. [13] and Majuca et al. [10] focus on 7 different policies offered by AIG. We used these analyses of coverage to form our definition of cyber insurance.|$|R
40|$|The book explores, from a {{comparative}} and inter-disciplinary perspective, {{the relationship between}} fundamental rights and private law in Europe, a debate usually referred to as Drittwirkung or horizontal effect of fundamental rights. It discusses the different models of horizontal effect and the impact that fundamental rights may have in shaping tort law, especially the position of child tortfeasors. The book concentrates on several European jurisdictions, namely France, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, and England and Wales. At a crossroad between human rights and European private law, this study draws insights from several legal fields (<b>international,</b> European, <b>tort,</b> constitutional and child law), sociology, psychology, and feminist studies. It also considers policy implications and advances proposals which would ensure the optimisation of the effect, and maximisation of the effectiveness, of fundamental rights in tort law, and more generally in private law. This book departs from traditional legal doctrines and offers a more pragmatic, comprehensive and just legal analysis {{of the role of}} fundamental rights in private law. It will be of interest to undergraduate and postgraduate students, academics, practitioners, policy-makers and activists with an interest in human rights, tort law, comparative law, children's rights and European private law...|$|R
40|$|Many {{agree that}} private {{international}} law does {{a poor job of}} leading to good and predictable results. Can law and economics bring more scientific, objective foundations to the discipline? Economics, one may hope, can bring the conclusiveness to the field that doctrine could not. But even a fleeting review of existing studies reveals a discrepancy of views or economic approaches that mirrors the discrepancy in the traditional {{private international law}} doctrine. This article sets out to test whether different models lead to different outcomes. It makes arguments in three economic models - a private law model, an international law model, and a model combining the two. The subject area for this analysis is private <b>international</b> law of <b>torts,</b> more specifically the question of the law applicable to cross-border torts. The result is that the debate whether private international law is 2 ̆ 2 private law 2 ̆ 2 or (public) 2 ̆ 2 international law 2 ̆ 2 is replicated in the economic analysis of private international law. Rather than resolve problems of private international law, economic analysis reformulates them. This does not make economic analysis useless at all, but it puts into question its promise of objective neutral solutions...|$|R
40|$|Private {{international}} law (choice of law) {{is generally considered}} a discipline {{in dire need of}} a methodological approach. Can law and economics bring more scientific, objective foundations? This article sheds light on this question, from the example of choice of law in torts. The first object {{of this article is to}} provide an analysis of three particular questions in the private <b>international</b> law of <b>torts</b> - the common domicile exception to lex loci, party autonomy, and cross-border torts - from an economic perspective. This article differs from others insofar as I make arguments on each of these questions not within one but within two economic paradigms, a private law paradigm and an {{international law}} paradigm. This relates to the second object of this article. I want to test the hypothesis that different paradigms lead to different outcomes, that the different results within different economic paradigms are congruent with the different views within traditional doctrinal private international law, and that therefore the debate whether private international law is private or (public) international law, is replicated in the economic analysis of private international law, and. If this is so, it suggests that the choice of one paradigm or another cannot only be justified in passing in a short introduction, as is the case in many economic analyses. Rather, for a robust normative analysis, this choice must be central to an economic analysis...|$|R
40|$|Numerous scandals {{arising from}} the United States {{government}} 2 ̆ 7 s increased use of armed private military contractors have drawn attention to the contractors 2 ̆ 7 legally ill-defined position. But {{the complexity of the}} contractors 2 ̆ 7 relation to various bodies of law and doctrine - including military law, <b>international</b> law, state <b>tort</b> law, employment law, and sovereign immunity - is not the only salient issue. The contractors are also awkwardly positioned in relation to the traditional understanding of sacrifice, which has structured Americans 2 ̆ 7 imaginings about those who kill and are killed on behalf of the nation. In this understanding, there is a mutually constitutive relationship between citizenship and sacrifice. This Article examines the contractors 2 ̆ 7 relation to the tradition of sacrifice and finds that they are officially excluded from it-their deaths are not included in body counts, for instance, and they are not given medals and honors. It construes the emergence of the contractor as an effort by U. S. officials to avoid the political liability entailed in calling a loss a sacrifice and discusses {{the way in which the}} legal form of contract and the policy of privatization have been means through which this is attempted. The Article then focuses on one case in which this effort ran into difficulties: the spectacular and grotesque killing, dismembering and immolation of four Blackwater contractors in Fallujah, Iraq. In this event, individuals who had contracted their services came to be seen as having sacrificed for the U. S. In conclusion, the Article urges that while it is important to address the lack of legal clarity surrounding contractors, it is also necessary to address their position in the tradition of sacrifice and attend to the deeper issues of popular and governmental sovereignty which that tradition articulates...|$|R
40|$|The {{laws of war}} are {{undergoing}} a fundamental transformation. The first step was the unmooring of the obligations of states and armies from the binds of reciprocity - the prospect that violations should be avoided because they will result in comparable reprisals {{from the other side}} - that began with the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and culminated in the 1977 Additional Protocols (AP I and II). The second major step - still an ongoing process - has been to substitute for the threat of reprisals the grounding of these obligations in enforceable, positive law. What started haltingly with the promulgation of several “grave” offenses in Geneva has—with the establishment of the International Criminal Court, international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda authorized by the UN Security Council, conventions against torture and other practices, and the sustained pressure of a proliferating number of nongovernmental organizations seeking to enforce human and IHL rights violations through <b>international</b> criminal and <b>tort</b> law - reshaped the international legal landscape. These developments call for closer attention to AP I, the principal legal framework for regulating warfare that many writers on international law believe binds not only ratifying countries, but also all nations and their inhabitants as a matter of customary international law. In an earlier article in this journal, I argued that the growth of “guerrilla” or irregular warfare - involving non-state armed groups locating themselves within dense civilian settlements in order to provoke a military response from occupying or NATO armies that would inevitably cause civilian casualties and generate additional recruits for the insurgent cause - requires a greater emphasis on broadly defining and strongly enforcing the duties of defenders to refrain from locating their military forces and assets among civilians. The overarching objective of IHL is to reduce unnecessary harm to civilians in the armed conflicts that warfare causes. This risk of harm is a joint product of both defenders and attackers and has to be regulated as such. The focus of this article is on the so-called principle of “proportionality,” which regulates the conduct of warfare in an effort to limit harm to civilians during otherwise legitimate armed conflict. I use the qualifying adjective “so-called” because “proportionality” in this context is a misnomer. The actual obligation, as set forth in Articles 51 (5) (b) and 57 (2) (b) of AP I, speaks in terms of prohibiting (and deferring) attacks expected to cause incidental civilian losses “which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. ” Neither the text nor the policy of IHL requires some form of “balancing” or use of a “sliding scale” to ensure that the military objective is “proportionate,” in the sense of being commensurate with the extent of civilian losses? What is required is that the military use no more force than necessary to accomplish concrete, direct military objectives. The proposed “excessive loss” formulation is not only truer to the text of AP I but provides a sounder, more principled basis for judging violations, for insisting on military commander compliance - than the more elastic, manipulable “proportionality” formulation, which invites commentators and tribunals to second-guess military objectives and compare and weigh essentially non-comparable factors...|$|R
40|$|This Article - {{part of a}} {{symposium}} on civil litigation and terrorism - focuses on {{the potential of the}} Alien Tort Statute (ATS) to serve as a vehicle for asserting civil claims in U. S. courts for acts of terrorism. Although this paper primarily considers terrorism torts under the 2 ̆ 2 law of nations 2 ̆ 2 prong of the ATS (which requires a showing that the relevant prohibition is part of customary <b>international</b> law), terrorism <b>torts</b> may provide a vehicle for activating the ATS 2 ̆ 7 s dormant treaty prong as well, given the strong support for the terrorism treaties exhibited by the United States and the high degree of domestic incorporation of the crimes identified therein. One of the first modern cases to be filed under the Alien Tort Statute, Tel-Oran v. Libyan Arab Republic, immediately called into question the utility of the ATS as a counter-terrorism tool. Ever since, the statute has been relatively underutilized in this context, even while U. S. courts have gradually extended jurisdiction under the ATS over other international crimes. Meanwhile, the U. S. Congress has vastly expanded opportunities for U. S. nationals to pursue civil claims in domestic courts for acts of terrorism. For example, the Antiterrorism Act (ATA) enables U. S. nationals - as well as their estates, survivors, and heirs - to sue individuals responsible for personal, property, or business injuries incurred by reason of acts of international terrorism. U. S. victims and claimants may also sue states and state agents implicated in acts of terrorism under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act (FSIA), so long as the state itself has been specifically designated as a 2 ̆ 2 sponsor of terrorism 2 ̆ 2 by the Department of State or where the circumstances otherwise satisfy one of the codified exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity. As compared with these statutory causes of action for U. S. citizen victims and claimants, only the ATS has the potential to provide jurisdiction over civil claims arising out of acts of terrorism brought by non-nationals who have access to U. S. courts. This paper argues that the uncertainty surrounding the availability of the ATS to permit such terrorism claims reveals a lacuna in the United States 2 ̆ 7 anti-terrorism statutory scheme. Since the U. S. Supreme Court issued its landmark opinion in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain and finally set forth a methodology for considering actionable claims under the ATS, a few cases involving terrorism allegations have begun to work their way through the federal court system. Although it is still difficult to draw broad conclusions, the existing cases do demonstrate that the various federal statutes - the ATA, FSIA, and ATS - can work in tandem to provide causes of action to alien and U. S. plaintiffs injured in terrorist incidents. Furthermore, litigants are creatively utilizing multiple causes of action drawn from statutes, the common law, and international law to press their claims. While the federal courts have yet to definitively recognize a standalone cause of action for terrorism stricto sensu, developments in the law of terrorism at the international level reveal the gradual crystallization of a consensus set of elements that comprise a definitive prohibition against terrorism applicable to all but a narrow set of circumstances. What lingering definitional impasse exists highlights an unsettled and highly contentious area of international law: the legal categorization and consequences of attacks by unprivileged combatants against privileged combatants or military targets. In all other situations, the international law governing acts of terrorism is sufficiently precise, robust, and uncontroversial to support the recognition by the federal courts of a cause of action for terrorism under the ATS, assuming the other jurisdictional requirements are satisfied. Recognizing such causes of action will bolster the United States 2 ̆ 7 counter-terrorism regime by enabling a broader array of victims of acts of terror to pursue the assets of individuals and groups that finance or otherwise support acts of terrorism...|$|R
