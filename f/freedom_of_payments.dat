The area appears to have remained under the Nabatean sphere of influence, outwith the Hasmonaean and Herodian Kingdoms, until AD 105 when Trajan annexed the Nabataean Kingdom. A large rectangular hill-top fort probably dates from the 4th century AD. A church and associated buildings have been dated as having been built before AD 464. Auja al-Hafir was struck by the great plague which swept the Eastern Mediterranean around AD 541. During the 1930s a large number of papyri, dating from the 6th and 7th century, were found. One of which is from the local Arab governor granting Christian inhabitants <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> worship on <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> the appropriate tax.

Political stability has {{an important role in}} determination of healthy <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> than economic <b>freedom.</b> This study focus on selected 10 Asian countries of various income levels and test the factor of political stability and economic <b>freedom</b> in stability <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> by using a simple econometric model with various techniques. Our empirical finding shows that political stability is more important than economic freedom in stabilizing balance <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Stable political regime with visionary leadership leads the nations to higher level of favorable balance <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Political stability is playing major role than theoretical explanation to achieve surplus <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> hence exchange rare stability.

40|$|Starting {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the Diner's Club payment card in 1949, the means of exchange have progressed well beyond traditional instruments such as notes, coins and cheques. I use institutional economics to analyse historical data on the evolution <b>of</b> recently-developed retail <b>payment</b> systems in Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States. The framework I create yields insights into the incentives faced by the users <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> instruments and the payment networks that provide them. It also provides a means to assess the role of government in the evolution <b>of</b> retail <b>payment</b> systems. Ceteris paribus, consumers and merchants will prefer low transaction cost payment instruments. In order to complete a transaction, a consumer will proffer an instrument {{that may or may not}} be accepted by the merchant. Together, merchants and consumers will choose the payment instrument that generally reduces demand-side – i. e. consumer and merchant – transaction costs, relative to other available instruments. Consumer irreversible costs of adoption enhance the importance of network effects. To help overcome these, I argue payment networks need to make acceptance of their instrument attractive to merchants, which I find to be supported by analysis of the pricing <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> instruments. It distinguishes recently-developed payment instruments from other new technologies – the most technologically advanced instrument will not likely be adopted unless it is first acceptable to merchants. In workably competitive conditions, profit-seeking payment networks will attempt to provide an instrument that gets used while it at least recoups its costs of supply from fees paid by users. I argue this suggests a process of institutional adaption for profit-seeking payment networks. Network effects mean the use of an instrument grows disproportionately faster, the greater the number of people using it. For instrument supply, this means profit-seeking payment networks have an incentive to increase participation. In the presence of potential inter-network competition, a payment network will likely experience greater participation if, ceteris paribus, it offers an instrument that generally reduces demand-side transaction costs to a greater degree than competing networks' instruments and provides it with lower costs of supply. Governments play two key roles in retail payment system development. First, they can affect the development of systems by how well they protect property rights and enforce contracts. Although this role is performed relatively well in my sample countries, my analysis suggests that the use <b>of</b> recently-developed retail <b>payment</b> systems would fall, substantially, were it not so. Second and more importantly in my sample countries, governments impose restrictions on the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> contract for <b>payment</b> networks. If restrictions on this freedom are such that they prevent the trading of property rights, they risk reducing either the demand or the supply <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> instruments. Such restrictions might reduce demand if the instrument that would have been used no longer generally reduces demand-side transaction costs. They might reduce supply in two ways: by impeding payment networks' attempts to offer instruments that reduce these transaction costs or by reducing inter-network competition. In summary, I find that it is government restrictions on the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> contract that cause the substantial differences in the use <b>of</b> newly-developed retail <b>payment</b> systems between my sample countries. By risking reducing the supply and demand <b>of</b> retail <b>payment</b> systems, these restrictions may diminish innovation in payments, thereby harming dynamic efficiency...|$|R
40|$|<b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> {{establishment}} {{statutes that}} restriction of citizens within the EU can not occur. A citizen {{should be free}} to establish themselves in a Member State and not be hindered if they choose to leave the State. "Citizens" also includes legal persons such as companies. Legislations in Member States which prevents the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> establishment shall be prohibited. When a company chooses to merge across borders and thus cease to be a Swedish company, the Swedish rules for exit taxation applies. This means that assets and unrealized gains will be taxed immediately. If the company instead chose to reorganize within the country, or to do nothing at all, a tax will only arise when the asset is sold. This different treatment could constitute a restriction <b>of</b> a company's <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> establishment and thus discourage companies from moving to or from Sweden. The Malta case resulted in that the legislature introduced rules for deferment <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> tax. Today there is an opportunity for companies that choose to move abroad to obtain a suspension <b>of</b> the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> taxes just to be more in line with the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> establishment. Companies must meet certain conditions in order to be granted a deferral. If a company carries out a merger that falls within Chapter 22. 5 § 2 p. IL, exit taxation will be applied. There is no possibility for a company, which is subject to exit taxation according to Chapter 22. 5 § 2 p. IL, to be subject to deferral rules since 2 p. is not covered by the rules of deferral. Only mergers according to Chapter 22. 5 § 4 and 5 p. IL. are subject to deferral. There are less restrictive measures to take than immediate taxation which is more in line with the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> establishment. Examples of less restrictive measures are an extension of the already existing deferral rules or taxing companies on the disposal of the assets...|$|R

This Sanskrit {{document}} from the Maurya Empire period (4th century BCE), has been translated by several authors. Shamasastry's translation in 1915, Kangle's translation in 1960s and Rangarajan's translation in 1987 all map dasa as slave. However, Kangle suggests that the context and rights granted to dasa by Kautilya, such {{as the right to}} the same wage as a free labourer and the right to <b>freedom</b> on <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> an amount, distinguish this form of slavery from that of contemporary Greece. Edmund Leach points out that the Dasa was the antithesis of the concept of Arya.
