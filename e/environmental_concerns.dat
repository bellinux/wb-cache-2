30|$|The {{findings}} in this study imply unique value that extends prior understanding regarding spillover in pro-environmental behaviors. In particular, the finding that <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> works as a linkage (i.e., mediator) across different pro-environmental behaviors broadens the existing research perspectives on it. Most extant research on <b>environmental</b> <b>concern,</b> mainly built on the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen 1991), viewed <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> as a belief or an attitude which functions a direct antecedent to specific behaviors. Recent research then paid attention to different roles that <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> might play and demonstrated its indirect role (i.e., moderator) in controlling the formation of consumers’ pro-environmental behavior (e.g., Bamberg 2003). This study adds another role of <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> in that, in the context of pro-environmental behaviors, <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> mediates a consumer’s performance of pro-environmental behaviors across different settings (e.g., recycling translated into green apparel purchases). As different roles may be due to how <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> is defined (Bamberg 2003), further investigation into <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> in more depth may be beneficial.|$|R

Also, {{previous research has}} not systematically addressed the influence of interpretation services on <b>environmental</b> <b>concern,</b> and {{little research has been}} conducted in developing Eastern countries. Thus, this study?s objective was to determine whether recreation participation (appreciative vs. consumptive forms) and/or interpretation programs (based on Tilden?s principles of interpretation) influence Thai park visitors? <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> (EC) EC was operationalized through the measurement of three variables: specific <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> (SEC), worldwide <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> (WEC), and <b>environmental</b> behavior (EB). Data were collected through an experimental design. Two hundred forty Thai students were systematically assigned to one of eight experimental conditions defined by recreation type (appreciative vs. consumptive), recreation activity nested within recreation type (nature photography, hiking, motorcycling, and motorboating), and Tildenian interpretation (interpretation service provided vs. not provided). Results suggest that appreciative recreation activities enhance <b>environmental</b> <b>concern,</b> and interpretation can mitigate effects of consumptive forms of recreation, particularly in terms of worldview <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> and <b>environmental</b> behavior. Future research should assess a relationship between recreation specialization and <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> and the impact of recreation participant and/or interpretation services on participants? delightedness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Many have {{hypothesized}} and intuited {{a relationship}} between participation in outdoor recreation and concern {{about the state of}} the environment. It is believed that participating in outdoor recreation can influence <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> by exposing people to specific instances of environmental degradation and increasing their concern about such degradation on a broader scale. Research examining this phenomenon has found moderate to weak support for a direct connection between outdoor recreation participation and <b>environmental</b> <b>concern.</b> Using structural equation analysis, we examined whether the meaning of non-consumptive outdoor recreation to recreationists mediated the relationship between non-consumptive outdoor recreation participation and <b>environmental</b> <b>concern.</b> A mail-back survey of Washington State residents (n = 900) found that outdoor recreation meaning was a better predictor of <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> than measures of participation. However results also suggest that the relationship between <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> and the meaning of non-consumptive outdoor recreation was not a particularly strong one and that meaning is likely one of many factors that might influence <b>environmental</b> <b>concern...</b>|$|R

Second, we analyze the determinants of <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> by employing multilevel models that take individual as well as context effects into account. Third, we explore the impact of attitudes on environmental behavior and support of environmental policies. The results show that <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> is closely correlated with the wealth of nations. However, <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> decreased in OECD as well as non-OECD nations slightly during the last two decades. The decline was lower in countries with improving economic conditions suggesting that economic growth helps to maintain higher levels of <b>environmental</b> <b>concern.</b> Furthermore, attitudes have a stronger impact on support of environmental policies as compared to everyday environmental behavior...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between children 2 ̆ 7 s <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> and grade, sex, environmental attitudes and behaviors, locus of control, and perceived competencies. This study also assessed other common non-environmental concerns of school-age children. It was found that children were moderately concerned about the environment, with <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> ranking in the middle of other common non-environmental concerns of children. No significant sex differences in <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> were found. It was predicted that older children would be more concerned about the environment than would younger children. This prediction was not supported. First graders were significantly more concerned about the environment than third or fifth graders. It was predicted that <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> would be positively correlated with environmental attitudes and behaviors. These predictions were supported for first and fifth grade girls, but not for any other groups. No relationships between <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> and locus of control or manifest anxiety were found for any groups. It was found that <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> was significantly and positively correlated with global self-worth for the total sample, and with behavioral conduct for fifth grade girls. No other significant correlations were found between <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> and perceived competencies for the other groups. It was found that children 2 ̆ 7 s environmental attitudes were significantly and positively correlated with children 2 ̆ 7 s environmental behaviors. Environmental attitudes were also significantly and positively correlated with scholastic competence and behavioral conduct. No relationships were found between environmental attitudes or behaviors and locus of control or manifest anxiety. Children 2 ̆ 7 s environmental attitudes were found to be a significant component of <b>environmental</b> <b>concern,</b> with more pro-environmental attitudes being associated with greater <b>environmental</b> <b>concern.</b> Manifest anxiety was also found to comprise <b>environmental</b> <b>concern,</b> with less anxiety being associated with greater concern. Finally, differences were found between children exhibiting the highest and lowest levels of <b>environmental</b> <b>concern.</b> Children with greater <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> were more worried about environmental problems, and were able to generate more ways that they could help save the environment. They also reported more ways that their parents helped save the environment. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that higher <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> goes with more {{positive}} attitudes toward environmental management strategies and more environmentally friendly behavior.

Moreover, it appeared that respondents differing in <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> (as measured by the New Environmental Paradigm Scale and myths of nature) varied substantially in their preferences for environmental management strategies. Respondents with a high <b>environmental</b> risk <b>concern</b> had higher preferences for behavioral change strategies and government regulation, whereas respondents with a low <b>environmental</b> risk <b>concern</b> had higher preferences for market-oriented solutions.

Empirical tests show that certain facets of stated <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> (such as New Environmental Paradigm, environmental-economic tradeoff, and participation in outdoor activities), psychological traits of trust and empathy, socio-demographic characteristics of gender and residence, as well as pecuniary incentives, including monetary benefits and opportunity costs, are good predictors of actual behavior in the revealed <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> experiment. The results support general external validity of <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> constructs. They also add to the discussion of what psychological factors drive individuals' actions benefiting the environment, which is of particular interest to environmental agencies and organizations. In addition, we find evidence of a common understanding of how much ought to be donated, as donations are less sensitive to external factors compared to actions based on monetary incentives.
