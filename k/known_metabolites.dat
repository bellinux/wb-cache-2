When isotope labeled metabolites do not co-elute with the unlabeled version, changes in the concentration of one compound can cause variance in the measurements of a different compound due to insufficient HPLC chromatographic separation or ion suppression in LC-MS (Liu et al. 2002; Annesley 2003), {{commonly referred to as}} matrix effect.
