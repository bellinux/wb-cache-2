Here, we assessed the feasibility of recombinants of rabies virus (RV) vector for <b>dual</b> transneuronal <b>tracing</b> in the central nervous system. First, we examined whether two different RV-vectors can double label cells in vitro, and showed that efficient double labeling can be realized by infecting targeted cells with the two RV-vectors within a short time interval. The potential of <b>dual</b> transneuronal <b>tracing</b> was then examined in vivo in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, using the chain of projections from CA 3 pyramidal cells to CA 1 pyramidal cells and subsequently to entorhinal cortex. Six days after the injection of two RV-vectors into the left and right entorhinal cortex respectively, double-labeled neurons were observed in CA 3 bilaterally. Some double-labeled neurons showed a Golgi-like labeling. <b>Dual</b> transneuronal <b>tracing</b> potentially provides a powerful and sensitive method to study issues such as the amount of convergence and divergence within and between circuits in the central nervous system. Using this sensitive technique, we established that single neurons in CA 3 are connected to the entorhinal cortex bilaterally with only one synaptic relay. © 2009 Ohara, Inoue, Yamada, Yamawaki, Koganezawa, Tsutsui, Witter and Iijima...|$|R

However, following the delivery of retrograde tracers into the ventral anterior/ventral lateral thalamic nuclei, a moderate number of labeled neurons were found within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in control cases, MPTP-treated monkeys and animals with levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Furthermore, <b>dual</b> <b>tracing</b> experiments showed that subthalamo-thalamic and subthalamo-pallidal projections arise from different subpopulations of STN efferent neurons.

40|$|Coughing protects and {{clears the}} airways and lungs of inhaled irritants, particulates, pathogens, and {{accumulated}} secretions. An initial urge to cough, {{and an almost}} binary output suggests gating mechanisms that encode and modulate this defensive reflex. Whether this “gate” has a physical location for the physiological barrier it poses to cough is unknown. Here we describe a critical component to cough gating, the central terminations of the cough receptors. A novel microinjection strategy defined coordinates for microinjection of glutamate receptor antagonists that nearly abolished cough evoked from the trachea and larynx in anesthetized guinea pigs while having no effect on basal respiratory rate and little or no effect on reflexes attributed to activating other afferent nerve subtypes. Comparable microinjections in adjacent brainstem locations (0. 5 – 2 mm distal) were without effect on coughing. Subsequent transganglionic and <b>dual</b> <b>tracing</b> studies confirmed that the central terminations of the cough receptors and their primary relay neurons are found bilaterally within nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS), lateral to the commissural subnucleus and perhaps in the medial subnuclei.

A capacity for integrating unique combinations of cortical inputs {{has been well documented}} in the basal ganglia circuits but is largely undefined in the precerebellar circuits. To compare and quantify the amount of overlap that occurs in the first link of the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway, a <b>dual</b> <b>tracing</b> approach was used to map the spatial relationship between projections originating from the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) and the primary motor cortex (M 1). Because overlap is most likely to occur among functionally related projections, we injected small amounts of the anterograde tracers biotinylated dextran amine and Fluoro-Ruby into electrophysiologically identified, homologous whisker representations in the above mentioned areas. The ensuing pontine labeling patterns were analyzed using a computerized three-dimensional reconstruction approach. The results demonstrate that whisker-related projections from S 1 and M 1 are largely segregated but occupy partly adjacent territories of the pontine nuclei. At some locations, the two projections are adjoining and partly overlapping. Furthermore, S 1 contributes significantly more corticopontine projections in strength than corresponding M 1 representations. Because the experimental animals previously were used to study corticostriatal projections, we compared the relative patterns of corticostriatal and corticopontine projections from the same pairs of cortical sites. Corticopontine and corticostriatal projections revealed a lower degree of S 1 -M 1 overlapin the pontine nuclei than in the neostriatum.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that newly encoded {{memories}} are more resistant to retroactive interference when participants are allowed to sleep after learning the original material, suggesting a sleep-related strengthening of memories. In the present study, we investigated delayed, long-term effects of sleep vs. sleep deprivation (SD) on the first post-training night on memory consolidation and resistance to interference. On day 1, participants learned a list of unrelated word pairs (AB), either in the morning or in the evening, then spent the post-training night in a sleep or sleep deprivation condition, in a within-subject paradigm. On day 4, at the same time of day, they learned a novel list of word pairs (AC) in which 50 % of the word pairs stemmed with the same word than in the AB list, resulting in retroactive interference. Participants had then to recall items from the AB list upon presentation of the "A" stem. Recall was marginally improved in the evening, as compared to the morning learning group. Most importantly, retroactive interference effects were found in the sleep evening group only, contrary to the hypothesis that sleep exerts a protective role against intrusion by novel but similar learning. We tentatively suggest that these results can be explained in the framework of the memory reconsolidation theory, stating that exposure to similar information sets back consolidated items in a labile form again sensitive to retroactive interference. In this context, sleep might not protect against interference but would promote an update of existing episodic memories while preventing saturation of the memory network due to the accumulation of <b>dual</b> <b>traces.</b> Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

Depending on the periodicity we impose on the gravitational solution, we consider two different possibilities and compare the associated entropies with the results obtained through a minimal area computation. To our surprise we discover that, at first order, both choices correctly reproduce the associated entanglement entropy. Furthermore we find unexpected divergent contributions {{that we have to}} discard in order to fit the minimal area computation, and an additional requirement that needs to be imposed on the β dependence on the metric.

40|$|Although {{currently}} available retrograde tracers are useful tools for identifying striatal projection neurons, transported tracers often remained restricted within the neuronal somata and the thickest, main dendrites. Indeed, thin dendrites located {{far away from}} the cell soma as well as post-synaptic elements such as dendritic spines cannot be labeled unless performing intracellular injections. In this regard, the subsequent use of anterograde tracers for the labeling of striatal afferents often failed to unequivocally elucidate whether a given afferent makes true contacts with striatal projections neurons. Here we show that such a technical constraint can now be circumvented by retrograde tracing using rabies virus (RV). Immunofluorescence detection with a monoclonal antibody directed against the viral phosphoprotein resulted in a consistent Golgi-like labeling of striatal projection neurons, allowing clear visualization of small-size elements such as thin dendrites as well as dendritic spines. The combination of this retrograde <b>tracing</b> together with <b>dual</b> anterograde <b>tracing</b> of cortical and thalamic afferents {{has proven to be a}} useful tool for ascertaining striatal microcircuits. Indeed, by taking advantage of the trans-synaptic spread of RV, different subpopulations of local-circuit neurons modulating striatal efferent neurons can also be identified. At the striatal level, structures displaying labeling were visualized under the confocal laser-scanning microscope at high resolution. Once acquired, confocal stacks of images were firstly deconvoluted and then processed through 3 D-volume rendering in order to unequivocally identify true contacts between pre-synaptic elements (axon terminals from cortical or thalamic sources) and post-synaptic elements (projection neurons and/or interneurons labeled with RV) ...|$|R
