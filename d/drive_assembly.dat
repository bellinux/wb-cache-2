50|$|StreetStrider is {{the brand}} name for a mobile {{elliptical}} trainer. The StreetStrider consists of a T-shaped lower frame to which two front wheels and a rear wheel containing a <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> are attached, and an upright frame to which two reciprocating arm levers are attached. Two elongated foot platforms {{on either side of}} the lower frame are attached to cranks as part of the <b>drive</b> <b>assembly,</b> which, as with bicycle drivetrain systems, also includes a hub, a rotating axle, and an internal hub gear system translating the axle rotation to the hub. The StreetStrider <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> is either chained or chainless direct drive, depending on model. The lower end of each arm lever is attached to the front end of each foot platform, which, by connection in the rear to the rotating crank arm and in the front to the pivoting arm lever, moves generally in an elliptical path. The device also includes a leaning mechanism for steering, as well as brakes and multiple gearing. It was developed by David W. Kraus.|$|E

50|$|A pugmill or {{pug mill}} is a machine in which clay or other {{materials}} are mixed {{into a plastic}} state or a similar machine for the trituration of ore. Industrial applications are found in pottery, bricks, cement and {{some parts of the}} concrete and asphalt mixing processes. A pugmill may be a fast continuous mixer. A continuous pugmill can achieve a thoroughly mixed, homogeneous mixture in a few seconds, and the right machines can be matched to the right application by taking into account the factors of agitation, <b>drive</b> <b>assembly,</b> inlet, discharge, cost and maintenance. Mixing materials at optimum moisture content requires the forced mixing action of the pugmill paddles, while soupy materials might be mixed in a drum mixer. A typical pugmill consists of a horizontal boxlike chamber with a top inlet and a bottom discharge at the other end, 2 shafts with opposing paddles, and a <b>drive</b> <b>assembly.</b> Some of the factors affecting mixing and residence time are the number {{and the size of the}} paddles, paddle swing arc, overlap of left and right swing arc, size of mixing chamber, length of pugmill floor, and material being mixed.|$|E

5000|$|A cush {{drive is}} a part of a {{motorcycle}} or scooter drive-train that is designed to reduce stress from engine torque damaging other components during gear or throttle changes. A common design used by almost all street motorcycles, it has three major pieces: the wheel, the sprocket assembly, and the rubber damper. The wheel and the sprocket assembly fit together with five or more sections much like two hands woven together. In between the contact of the two assembly are rubber blocks. This makes it so the wheel and the sprocket have a dampening layer between them, and the rubber blocks reduce wear and fatigue of the metal assemblies. Another popular system incorporates metallic compression type coil springs placed between the input and output shafts of the cush <b>drive</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Robotino {{is based}} on an {{omnidirectional}} <b>drive</b> <b>assembly,</b> which enables the system to roam freely. The robot is controlled by an industry-standard PC system, which is powerful enough to plan routes for fully autonomous driving. Via a WLAN-Link, Robotino can send all sensor readings to an external PC. In the other direction, control commands can be issued by the external PC. This way, control programs can run on the external PC or on Robotino directly. Mixed mode or shared control are also possible. For users with little prior robotics knowledge, Robotino can be readily programmed in its “native” programming environment RobotinoView II. More experienced programmers may find it useful that the robot can also be programmed in C, C++, Java, [...]NET, Matlab, Simulink, Labview and Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio.|$|E

5000|$|In one of {{the first}} models based on this theory, Jared Diamond (1975) {{developed}} quantitative [...] "assembly rules" [...] to predict avian community composition on an archipelago. Although the idea of deterministic community assembly quickly drew criticism, the assembly approach, which emphasized historical contingency and multiple stable states, continued to gain support. Drake (1991) used an assembly model to demonstrate that different community types would result from different sequences of species invasions. In Drake’s model, early invaders had major impacts on the invasion success of species that arrived later. Other modeling studies suggested that priority effects may be especially important when invasion frequency is low enough to allow species to become established before replacement, or when other factors that could <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> (e.g., competition, abiotic stress) are relatively unimportant. In a 1999 review, Belyea and Lancaster described three basic determinants of community assembly: dispersal constraints, environmental constraints, and internal dynamics. They identified priority effects as a manifestation of the interaction between dispersal constraints and internal dynamics.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sourcing}} of suitable engine, gearbox and final-drive components {{was considered}} {{critical to the}} success of delivering a low-cost mid-engined vehicle. Chapman was keen to diversify beyond the Ford components heavily used in earlier Lotus vehicles, and settled on using the engine and combined transmission/final-drive transaxle units recently released by Renault for their Renault 16. The 1470cc Renault engine was a light and modern design (if somewhat pedestrian in the Renault), while the matching Renault 16 transaxle seemed almost ideal for the Europa project. In the Renault vehicle, the transaxle sat ahead of the engine, driving the front wheels. By relocating the combined engine/transaxle unit to the rear of the car and rotating it 180 degrees in plan, Lotus could obtain a ready-made modern mid-engine configuration - albeit one with 4 reverse gears! By repositioning the differential crownwheel within the final <b>drive</b> <b>assembly,</b> the direction of rotation of the output shafts was reversed, thus correcting this [...] "shortcoming".|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was completed in}} May 1912 and taken by boat to Dale in Pembrokeshire for testing. The first trial showed the aircraft to accelerate well under {{the power of the}} water propellers, but after a short run the streamlined fairing of the hydropeds was torn away, ending the tests. Subsequent static tests revealed a vibration problem in the <b>drive</b> <b>assembly,</b> and while this was being examined trials were made by towing the aircraft behind a torpedo boat. Problems with stability were partially cured by minor changes to the parafoil lifting planes and the addition of a controllable water elevator and rudder to the aft hydroped, resulting in satisfactory towing characteristics, but when the water propellers were used the torque reaction caused the aircraft to heel over. In September it was decided to conduct flight trial by towing the aircraft, and the engine was removed and replaced by 500 lbs kg of ballast. On 21 September, towed by a torpedo boat, carrying George Dacre to monitor the instruments: the machine's controls were set for level flight and locked. It lifted off at an airspeed of 30 knots (35 mph, 56 km/h) in a nose-high attitude, stalled, sideslipped and crashed, happily without injuring Dacre.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the release}} of the SCPH-5000 series being {{produced}} only in Japan, it followed the same exterior design as the Japanese SCPH-3xxx series, its only differences being that it was switched to Rev.

This was followed by the first major consolidation, SCPH-550x/5001 and PAL-exclusive SCPH-5552 units, released in April 1997. This model further addressed the reliability issues with the disc <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> by placing the drive further away from the power supply in order to reduce heat; the chipset was also redesigned to use digital servo for focus/tracking and also to auto-calibrate the drive, as opposed to manual gain/bias calibration on earlier models. Also, shielding and PSU wiring were simplified, and from the SCPH-5001 on the RCA jacks and RFU power connectors were removed from the rear panel and the printed text on the back was changed to reliefs of the same.
