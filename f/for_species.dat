The floury baker is found {{on a wide variety}} of trees, with some preference <b>for</b> <b>species</b> of paperbark (Melaleuca). It is a relatively poor flier, preyed upon by cicada killer wasps and a wide variety of birds, and can succumb to a cicada-specific fungal disease.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{morphological}} features, the Alexandrine parakeet {{has been}} proposed as the founder population for all Psittacula species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species's southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range. Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the dodo, are descended from South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed that this {{may also be the}} case for all the parrots there. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible <b>for</b> <b>species</b> to colonise some of these less isolated islands.|$|E
5|$|Bony crests {{are found}} on the skulls of many theropods, {{including}} many tyrannosaurids. Alioramus, a possible tyrannosaurid from Mongolia, bears a single row of five prominent bony bumps on the nasal bones; a similar row of much lower bumps is present on the skull of Appalachiosaurus, {{as well as some}} specimens of Daspletosaurus, Albertosaurus, and Tarbosaurus. In Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus, there is a prominent horn in front of each eye on the lacrimal bone. The lacrimal horn is absent in Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which instead have a crescent-shaped crest behind each eye on the postorbital bone. These head crests may have been used for display, perhaps <b>for</b> <b>species</b> recognition or courtship behavior.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{such as the}} long, narrow kidney with reflexed ureter {{and closed}} {{secondary}} ureter, the penial complex with distinct penis, which is continuous with the epiphallus, epiphallic caecum (a flagellum and an appendix), unbranched gametolytic duct, lack of vaginal accessory organs, and the basic condition of the nervous and retractor muscle systems support the inclusion of Amphidromus in the family Camaenidae. This group of snails occur {{in a wide variety}} of habitats in the tropics of Eastern Asia and Australasia, and is one of the most diverse families in the clade Stylommatophora. Though Laidlaw & Solem (1961) provided no more additional details on the anatomy of Amphidromus, subsequent studies by distinct authors, e.g., Bishop (1977) and Solem (1983), have demonstrated that the reproductive system can provide valuable data <b>for</b> <b>species</b> recognition.|$|E

5|$|Hieronymus, in 2009, {{concluded}} that the nasal and supraorbital bosses were used for butting or ramming the head or the flank of a rival. The bone structure indicates that the bosses were covered by cornified pads as in modern muskoxen, suggesting dominance fights {{similar to those of}} members of the Caprinae subfamily. In the latter group, an evolutionary transition can be observed, where the originally straight horns become more robust, padded, and increasingly curved downwards. The evolution from horncores into bosses in Centrosaurinae would likewise have reflected a change in fighting technique, from clashing to high-energy head-butting. Head-butting would have been an expensive and risky behavior. Opponents would only have engaged this way after assessing each other's strengths visually. For this reason, Hieronymus considered it unlikely that the bosses served <b>for</b> <b>species</b> recognition as this was already guaranteed by the innate species-specific display rituals preceding a real – instead of a ritual – fight. The bosses would have evolved for actual combat, part of a social selection in which individuals competed for scarce resources such as mates, food and breeding grounds.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{migration}} {{has been}} recorded as much as 3,000 years ago by Ancient Greek authors including Homer and Aristotle, and in the Book of Job, <b>for</b> <b>species</b> such as storks, turtle doves, and swallows. More recently, Johannes Leche began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749, and scientific studies have used techniques including bird ringing and satellite tracking. Threats to migratory birds have grown with habitat destruction especially of stopover and wintering sites, as well as structures such as power lines and wind farms.|$|E
5|$|In a 2010 {{review of}} Stegosaurus species, Peter Galton {{suggested}} that {{the arrangement of the}} plates on the back may have varied between species, and that the pattern of plates as viewed in profile may have been important <b>for</b> <b>species</b> recognition. Galton noted that the plates in S. stenops have been found articulated in two staggered rows, rather than paired. Fewer S. ungulatus plates have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine. However, the type specimen of S. ungulatus preserves two flattened spine-like plates from the tail that are nearly identical in shape and size, but are mirror images of each other, suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs. Many of the plates are manifestly chiral and no two plates of the same size and shape have been found for an individual; however plates have been correlated between individuals. Well preserved integumentary impressions of the plates of Hesperosaurus show a smooth surface with long and parallel, shallow grooves. This indicates that the plates were covered in keratinous sheaths.|$|E

5|$|Many endemic Mascarene birds, {{including}} the dodo (Raphus cucullatus), {{are derived from}} South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed {{that this may be}} the case for all the parrots there as well. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible <b>for</b> <b>species</b> to colonise some of the then less isolated islands. Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced pectoral bones, and robust leg bones. Newton and Gadow found the Rodrigues parrot to be closely related to the broad-billed parrot (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) due to their large jaws and other osteological features, but were unable to determine whether they both belonged in the same genus, since a head-crest was only known from the latter. The British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles instead found their skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-five {{per cent}} of bird species are {{socially}} monogamous. These species pair {{for at least}} the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important <b>for</b> <b>species</b> in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen's {{recent work}} has {{concentrated}} on further large-scale collaborations {{with the same}} group of institutions studying global patterns in biodiversity. A survey of species richness and geographical range size did not show the decrease in range size from temperate regions to the tropics that had been previously assumed; although that pattern was largely true in the northern hemisphere, it did not appear to apply in the southern hemisphere. Research evaluating the relationship between extinction and human impact showed that, after controlling <b>for</b> <b>species</b> richness, the best predictors of the global pattern of extinction risk are measures of human impact, with ecological factors being of secondary importance. An examination of the distribution of rare and threatened vertebrate species, showed differing patterns for bird, mammal and amphibian species, which has consequences for hotspot-based conservation strategies.|$|E

5|$|Sculpturing is seen {{on many of}} {{the skull}} bones, in the form of long grooves, pits and protrusions. Like other ceratosaurs, the frontal bones of the skull roof were fused together. Carnotaurines {{commonly}} had bony projections from the skull. Carnotaurus had two pronounced horns, projecting outward above the eyes, while its close relative Aucasaurus had smaller projections in the same area. Majungasaurus and Rajasaurus had a single bony horn or dome, projecting upwards from the skull. These projections, like the horns of many modern animals, might have been displayed <b>for</b> <b>species</b> recognition or intimidation. In Arcovenator, the dorsal margin of the postorbital (and probably also the lacrimal) is thickened dorsolaterally, forming a strong and rugose bony brow ridge rising above the level of the skull roof. Maybe this rugose brow ridge supported a keratinous or scaly structure for displays.|$|E
5|$|Sea {{levels were}} lower during the Pleistocene, {{so it was}} {{possible}} <b>for</b> <b>species</b> to colonise the Mascarene Islands from other areas. The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times, {{as many of the}} species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. Réunion is 3 million years old, which is enough time for new genera to evolve, but many endemics would have been wiped out by the eruption of the volcano Piton des Neiges between 300,000 and 180,000 years ago. Most recent and extant species would therefore probably be descendants of animals which had recolonised the island from Africa or Madagascar after this event. If the Mascarene parrot had in fact evolved into a distinct genus on Réunion prior to the volcanic eruption, it would {{have been one of the}} few survivors of this extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are in {{some cases}} taken from their habitat and sold to {{tourists}} as souvenirs, ornaments, curios or for display in aquariums. In particular, Oreaster reticulatus, with its easily accessed habitat and conspicuous coloration, is widely collected in the Caribbean. In the early to mid 20th century, this species was common along the coasts of the West Indies, but collection and trade have severely reduced its numbers. In the State of Florida, O. reticulatus is listed as endangered and its collection is illegal. Nevertheless, it is still sold throughout its range and beyond.

5|$|Stropharia caerulea {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in the scientific literature by James Bolton in 1788, under the name Agaricus politus. This usage is not considered valid according to nomenclatural rules, because it was used by Christian Hendrik Persoon to refer to another species in his 1801 Synopsis methodica fungorum, which is a sanctioned work. Stropharia caerulea was officially described by mycologist Hanns Kreisel in 1979 from collections made near Woldegk, Germany. Machiel Noordeloos transferred the species to Psilocybe in 1995, but today this genus is mostly reserved <b>for</b> <b>species</b> that contain the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and psilocin.

5|$|The Everglades hosts 1,301 {{species of}} native flora that are {{tropical}} or subtropical in nature, which {{arrived on the}} Florida peninsula about 5,000 years ago.

A variety of avenues are available <b>for</b> <b>species</b> to be brought by humans deliberately or by accident: agricultural experiments, in shipping containers, or attached to vehicles.

There, Dr. Baker has been working on Eve, a more docile clone of Sil. Madsen and Helgenberger reprised their roles, while Henstridge played Eve. Species II was received by critics worse than the first film, garnering a 9% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and Madsen denounced it as a terrible film. The film's director, Peter Medak, attributed the failure of the film to not picking up the infected rat ending of the original film.
