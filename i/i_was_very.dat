5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater and was very surprised by it. It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of traditional Japanese music. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E
5|$|We {{took off}} from the {{concrete}} runway in Leck, Kirchner (Fhj.Fw Günther Kirchner) stayed 30 metres behind me on my right side as usual;... We climbed up to about 200 metres, when suddenly two Thunderbolts appeared behind us and instantly shot down Günther Kirchner's plane. I saw him jettison canopy and catapult but his parachute did not deploy. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> lucky that the Thunderbolts did not press on with another attack.|$|E
25|$|By taking {{nine and}} a half hours to make their 321 on winning the toss England could point to the {{difficulty}} of forcing the ball away from so turgid a pitch and so dusty an in-field and finally across a slow, lush, green carpet. Naturally suspicious of player's alibis, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> much on their side this time - up to a point.|$|E
6000|$|... "You try my patience," [...] {{her father}} went on, [...] "and {{you ought to}} know what <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not a <b>very</b> good man. Though <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> smooth externally, at bottom <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> passionate; and <b>I</b> assure you <b>I</b> can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> hard." ...|$|R

25|$|One arm lying {{west of the}} body, 23 feet long; one stump of arm about 4 feet long; three arms lying {{south of}} body and from {{appearance}} attached to same (although I did not dig quite to body, as it laid well down {{in the sand and}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> tired), longest one measured over 23 feet, the other arms were three to five feet shorter.|$|E
25|$|Soon I {{found myself}} on the main bandstand before this {{enormous}} crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E
25|$|World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{difficult}} for White {{because of his}} Socialist values. War of any kind was abhorrent to his beliefs, and he struggled during this period about how to respond when {{so much of the}} country was engaged in supporting the war. His family life faced a crisis when his sons Maynard and Lewis enlisted in the Army. Lewis was quickly discharged due to a heart defect, but Maynard remained in the service {{until the end of the}} war. In addition, his colleague Karl Struss had been sent to a detention camp because of his German heritage.|$|E

"I don't know," [...] said Newman; [...] "some of us <b>are</b> wicked, certainly. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> angry, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> sore, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> bitter, but <b>I</b> don't {{know that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> wicked. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> cruelly injured.

40|$|AKNOWLEDGMENT <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> {{thankful to}} Prof. Dr. Martin Riedmiller and Dr. Martin Lauer {{for giving me}} an {{opportunity}} to do research work in the field of Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning) and RoboCup.

25|$|I {{just had}} to lay it down, more or less: first track... second track – you know, really fast working on that. And all the guitar overdubs on Presence were done in one night. But I didn't think I {{would be able to}} do it in one night, I thought I'd have to do it across maybe three {{different}} nights to get the individual sections. Everything sort of crystallised and you'll notice everything was just pouring out. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> happy with the guitar playing on that whole album, you know as far as the maturity of playing goes.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> much {{surprised}} when Mill {{informed me that}} he had not read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire Hegelian philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry. I mentally confronted this with the opinion of the man at the Copenhagen University who knew the history of philosophy best, my teacher, Hans Brochner, who knew, so to speak, nothing of contemporary English and French philosophy, and did not think them worth studying. I {{came to the conclusion that}} here was a task for one who understood the thinkers of the two directions, who did not mutually understand one another. I thought that in philosophy, too, I knew what I wanted, and saw a road open in front of me.|$|E
25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is hard to}} say. A ranger's {{place is}} in the forest. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> seldom in town. Just now the danger of fires <b>is</b> great, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> uneasy. <b>I</b> may not <b>be</b> down again for a month." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{some will}} say, How shall <b>I</b> learn? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> stupid, and <b>I</b> confess that freely. And when I have learnt, how shall I act {{up to my}} lesson? For <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> weak; and that I confess freely likewise.|$|R

25|$|More commonly, women {{participated in}} the {{sciences}} through an association with a male relative or spouse. Caroline Herschel began her astronomical career, although somewhat reluctantly at first, by assisting her brother William Herschel. Caroline Herschel is most remembered for her discovery of eight comets and her Index to Flamsteed’s Observations of the Fixed Stars (1798). On August 1, 1786, Herschel discovered her first comet, much to the excitement of scientifically minded women. Fanny Burney commented on the discovery, stating that “the comet was very small, and had nothing grand or striking in its appearance; {{but it is the}} first lady’s comet, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> desirous to see it.” Marie-Anne Pierette Paulze worked collaboratively with her husband, Antoine Lavoisier. Aside from assisting in Lavoisier’s laboratory research, she was responsible for translating a number of English texts into French for her husband’s work on the new chemistry. Paulze also illustrated many of her husband’s publications, such as his Treatise on Chemistry (1789). Eva Ekeblad became the first woman inducted into the Royal Swedish Academy of Science (1748).|$|E

500|$|Daniels {{was born}} in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. His father was an {{engineer}} at Rolls-Royce and later a grocer, while his mother owned a children's clothes shop. He has recalled: [...] "I was quite a shy child, but quite disruptive as well. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> sneaky and underhanded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it <b>was</b> a <b>very</b> {{unsuccessful}} attempt," [...] said Edmund, again {{laughing at}} himself, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> glad it <b>is</b> over; for <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> obliged {{to be the}} high and mighty guardian all this time, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> tired of it;" [...] and he yawned.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> {{curious as}} to what my fans will think of the video actually, but I know that they love the song.

6000|$|... "I take no {{interest}} in my work when once it is typed," [...] Martha Grimes declared, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> sorry but <b>I</b> {{do not like to}} receive visitors. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> busy. Mr. Ware knows quite well that <b>I</b> like to <b>be</b> left alone." ...|$|R
500|$|Stephen Fry as Gordon Deitrich, a closeted {{homosexual}} and talk/comedy show host. When asked {{in an interview}} what he liked about the role, Fry replied [...] "Being beaten up! I hadn't been beaten up in a movie before and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> excited {{by the idea of}} being clubbed to death." ...|$|E
500|$|Band said, [...] "Most of {{the films}} that I made, that I conceived, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{involved}} with {{and in some cases}} directed, definitely started with the title and usually a piece of artwork that made sense. Then I would work back to the script and the story and make the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1965, Dylan {{returned}} from his tour of England feeling exhausted and dissatisfied with his material. He told journalist Nat Hentoff: [...] "I was going to quit singing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> drained." [...] The singer added, [...] "It's very tiring having other people {{tell you how much}} they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear Honor, do {{not take}} it thus. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> well now--I dare say <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> so to the last, {{and there is nothing}} terrible to the imagination. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> thankful for both the {{preparation}} and the absence of suffering.

6000|$|... "If {{you will}} excuse me," [...] he said, [...] "I will smoke a cigarette. Since you are here, Mr. Coulson, I {{may say that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> glad to meet you. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> glad, also, of this {{opportunity}} for a few minutes' conversation upon another matter." ...|$|R

500|$|... "My mom {{called me}} and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> depressed. I was on tour and I couldn't leave, so I went into the studio and I wrote this song 'Speechless,' and it's about these phone calls. My dad {{used to call me}} after he'd had a few drinks and I wouldn't know what to say. I was {{speechless}} and I just feared that I would lose him and I wouldn't be there." ...|$|E
500|$|Ellis {{admitted}} {{not being}} {{very familiar with}} the character, saying: [...] "All I remember of the Norman Osborn character was from the Spider-Man reprints my parents used to buy me when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> young, and Norman Osborn was this guy with a weird rippled crewcut who was always sweating {{and his eyes were}} always bulging out of his head. That guy as a Donald Rumsfeld-like public governmental figure... talked me into writing the book while I was still laughing."" ...|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> pleased it {{was made}} at all. ... There were people who said, 'I don't think we're going to do this', {{and we had to}} wait months to get the green light. We thought, 'Well, we haven't got the budget we want, we haven't got the {{schedule}} we want, so we're {{going to have to make}} it as brilliant as we can.' It was a costume drama and it needed a costume drama budget, and it didn't get that.|$|E
