40|$|Indonesia’s Investment Law and Negative Investment List (DNI) are not {{applicable}} <b>to</b> <b>capital</b> market transactions. Interpreted literally, this means foreign investors can arbitrarily increase their share participation in a company by <b>engaging</b> <b>capital</b> market transactions. This is not acceptable since the government puts a limit on foreign shares participation in certain business sectors. This normative-empiric study discusses practices in telecommunication industry that deviate from DNI, the conse-quences, and viable solutions. We found that literal interpretation is inconsistent to {{the objective of the}} DNI. We offer alternative approach that is more applicable and suitable to the given objec-tives.

40|$|In the {{standard}} neoclassical model, when two countries with disparate <b>capital</b> levels open <b>to</b> trade, the capital-rich country exports <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> the capital-poor country. This hastens {{growth in the}} poor country and generates income for the rich country, {{to the benefit of}} both. Real countries do not <b>engage</b> in this <b>capital</b> trade <b>to</b> the extent that theory predicts. It is widely understood that the weak property rights that afflict poor countries {{play a major role in}} this failure. Weak property rights make rich countries reticent about investment out of fear of expropriation. In this paper we also ascribe the insufficiency of international <b>capital</b> flows <b>to</b> weak property rights. But we model property rights as arising naturally during the process of economic growth. The impairment of trade is again the consequence of the reticence of rich countries: they want to avoid the erosion of their own property rights when trade occurs. </p...|$|R

This would knock out the enemy's secondary armament, punch holes in the lightly armoured bow and stern, perhaps knock down funnels and spotting tops, and destroy the bridge and command positions. Secondary guns were a very important factor in battleship combat.|$|R

40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the reasons that}} banks and other financial institutions <b>engage</b> in regulatory <b>capital</b> arbitrage and the techniques they use to do so. Regulatory capital arbitrage describes transactions and structures that firms use to lower the effective regulatory “tax rate” of regulatory <b>capital</b> requirements. <b>To</b> the extent that these regulations force financial institutions to internalize the externalities created by their potential insolvency (including systemic risk externalities), the incentives <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in regulatory <b>capital</b> arbitrage will persist. Financial institutions employ a range of complex transactions and structures, including securitization, <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in regulatory <b>capital</b> arbitrage. The article briefly sketches how capital regulations and regulatory capital arbitrage have evolved in dialectical fashion. This article concludes by describing and evaluating two broad approaches {{to dealing with the}} dynamic and unstable nature of capital rules (i. e. their constant erosion by regulatory capital arbitrage) : simple, broad brush rules (such as simple and large increases in regulatory capital levels) and more regulatory engineering that attempts {{to keep pace with the}} increasing complexity of financial institution balance sheets and transactions...|$|R
