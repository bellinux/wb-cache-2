5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding method {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, <b>electroslag</b> welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.|$|E

50|$|In {{the most}} complex melting arrangement, used only for {{production}} of nickel superalloy turbine forging blanks by spray forming, vacuum induction melting, <b>electroslag</b> re-melting and cold hearth crucibles have been combined by GE to control alloy impurity levels {{and the presence of}} refractory inclusions in the molten metal supply. Clean metal spray forming (CMSF) combines the <b>electroslag</b> refining process, cold walled induction guide and gas atomised spray forming. This approach has led to a {{reduction in the number of}} melt related defects (pores, inclusions, etc.), a finer average grain size, the ability to produce larger ingots and the ability to process a wider range of alloys.|$|E
50|$|Benefits of {{the process}} include its high metal {{deposition}} rates - it can lay metal at a rate between 15 and 20 kg per hour (35 and 45 lb/h) per electrode - {{and its ability to}} weld thick materials. Many welding processes require more than one pass for welding thick workpieces, but often a single pass is sufficient for <b>electroslag</b> welding. The process is also very efficient, since joint preparation and materials handling are minimized while filler metal utilization is high. The process is also safe and clean, with no arc flash and low weld splatter or distortion. <b>Electroslag</b> welding easily lends itself to mechanization, thus reducing the requirement for skilled manual welders.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process was}} {{patented}} by Robert K Hopkins in the United States in February 1940 (patent 2191481) and developed and refined at the Paton Institute, Kiev, USSR during the 1940s. The Paton method was {{released to the}} west at the Bruxelles Trade Fair of 1950. The first widespread use in the U.S. was in 1959, by General Motors Electromotive Division, Chicago, for the fabrication of traction motor frames. In 1968 Hobart Brothers of Troy, Ohio, released a range of machines {{for use in the}} shipbuilding, bridge construction and large structural fabrication industries. Between the late 1960s and late 1980s, it is estimated that in California alone over a million stiffeners were welded with the <b>electroslag</b> welding process. Two of the tallest buildings in California were welded, using the <b>electroslag</b> welding process - The Bank of America building in San Francisco, and the twin tower Security Pacific buildings in Los Angeles.The Northridge earthquake and the Loma Prieta earthquakes provided a [...] "real world" [...] test to compare all of the welding processes. The Structural Steel welding industry is well aware that, over one billion dollars in crack repairs were needed, after the Northridge earthquake, to repair weld cracks propagated in welds made with the gasless flux cored wire process. Not one failure or one crack propagation was initiated in any of the hundreds-of-thousands of welds made on continuity plates welded with the <b>Electroslag</b> welding process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electroslag</b> {{remelting}} uses highly reactive slags (calcium fluoride, lime, alumina, {{or other}} oxides {{are usually the}} main components) {{to reduce the amount}} of type-A sulfide present in biometal alloys. It is a common practice in European industries. ESR reduces other types of inclusions as well, and is seen as an alternative to the vacuum arc remelting method that is prevalent in US industries.|$|E
50|$|However the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) {{monitored}} the new process {{and found that}} <b>electroslag</b> welding, because of the very large amounts of confined heat used, produced a coarse-grained and brittle weld and in 1977 banned {{the use of the}} process for many applications. The FHWA commissioned research from universities and industry and Narrow Gap Improved Electro Slag Welding (NGI-ESW) was developed as a replacement. The FHWA moratorium was rescinded in 2000.|$|E
50|$|Electrogas welding (EGW) is a {{continuous}} vertical position arc welding process developed in 1961, {{in which an}} arc is struck between a consumable electrode and the workpiece. A shielding gas is sometimes used, but pressure is not applied. A major difference between EGW and its cousin <b>electroslag</b> welding is that the arc in EGW is not extinguished, instead remains struck throughout the welding process. It is used to make square-groove welds for butt and t-joints, especially in the shipbuilding industry and {{in the construction of}} storage tanks.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1978 {{advisory}} {{issued by}} the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the FHWA noted that tied-arch bridges are susceptible to problems caused by poor welds at {{the connection between the}} arch rib and the tie girders, and at the connection between the arch and vertical ties. In addition, problems with <b>electroslag</b> welds, while not isolated to tied-arch bridges, resulted in costly, time-consuming and inconveniencing repairs. The structure as a whole was described as [...] nonredundant; failure of either of the two tie girders would result in failure of the entire structure.|$|E

(ESW) is similar to electrogas welding, but the main difference is the arc starts in a different location. An electric arc is initially struck by wire that is fed into the desired weld location and then flux is added. Additional flux is added until the molten slag, reaching {{the tip of the}} electrode, extinguishes the arc. The wire is then continually fed through a consumable guide tube (can oscillate if desired) into the surfaces of the metal workpieces and the filler metal are then melted using the electrical resistance of the molten slag to cause [...] The wire and tube then move up along the workpiece while a copper retaining shoe that was put into place before starting (can be water-cooled if desired) is used to keep the weld between the plates that are being welded. <b>Electroslag</b> welding is used mainly to join low carbon steel plates and/or sections that are very thick. It can also be used on structural steel if certain precautions are observed. This process uses a direct current (DC) voltage usually ranging from about 600 A and 40-50 V, higher currents are needed for thicker materials. Because the arc is extinguished, this is not an arc process.|$|E

50|$|In EGW, {{the heat}} of the welding arc causes the {{electrode}} and workpieces to melt and flow into the cavity between the parts being welded. This molten metal solidifies from the bottom up, joining the parts being welded together. The weld area is protected from atmospheric contamination by a separate shielding gas, or by the gas produced by the disintegration of a flux-cored electrode wire. The electrode is guided into the weld area by either a consumable electrode guide tube, like the one used in <b>electroslag</b> welding, or a moving head. When the consumable guide tube is used, the weld pool is composed of molten metal coming from the parts being welded, the electrode, and the guide tube. The moving head variation uses an assembly of an electrode guide tube which travels upwards as the weld is laid, keeping it from melting.|$|E

The new ingot is covered in an engineered slag that is superheated by the electric current. The electrode tip is slowly melted from contact with the slag. These metal droplets travel through the slag to the bottom of the water-cooled mold and slowly freeze as the ingot is directionally solidified upwards from the bottom of the mold.
