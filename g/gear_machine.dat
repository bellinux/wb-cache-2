40|$|In {{machine design}} we {{always want to}} save space, save energy and produce as much power as possible. We can often reduce accelerations, {{inertial}} loads and energy consumption by changing construction. In this study the old cardan gear mechanism (hypocycloid mechanism) has been compared with the conventional slider-crank mechanism in air pumps and four-stroke engines. Comprehensive Newtonian dynamics has been derived for the both mechanisms. First the slidercrank and the cardan <b>gear</b> <b>machines</b> have been studied as lossless systems. Then the friction losses {{have been added to}} the calculations. The calculation results show that the cardan <b>gear</b> <b>machines</b> can be more efficient than the slider-crank machines. The smooth running, low mass inertia, high pressures and small frictional power losses make the cardan <b>gear</b> <b>machines</b> clearly better than the slider-crank machines. The dynamic tooth loads of the original cardan gear construction do not rise very high when the tooth clearances are kept tight. On the other hand the half-size crank length causes high bearing forces in the cardan <b>gear</b> <b>machines.</b> The friction losses of the cardan <b>gear</b> <b>machines</b> are generally quite small. The mechanical efficiencies are much higher in the cardan <b>gear</b> <b>machines</b> than in the slider-crank machines in normal use. Crankshaft torques and power needs are smaller in the cardan gear air pumps than in the equal slider-crank air pumps. The mean crankshaft torque and the mean output power are higher in the cardan gear four-stroke engines than in the slider-crank four-stroke engines in normal use. The cardan gear mechanism is at its best, when we want to build a pump or an engine with a long connecting rod (≈ 5 ⋅crank length) and a thin piston (≈ 1. 5 ⋅crank length) rotating at high angular velocity and intermittently high angular acceleration.

The force of the drive shaft is analyzed, and the vibration form of the drive shaft is confirmed. Using the lumped parameter method to simplify the {{main drive shaft}}, the lumped mass model and the force model were been obtained. When bending vibrating, the natural frequency of the main drive shaft is calculated using the transfer matrix method. The calculated critical speed is 43755 r/min, which far outweighs the motor rated speed. It means that the drive shaft under normal work won't be resonance, which accords with the request of production.

40|$|A pair of {{hypoid gears}} {{refers to a}} pinion and a gear with skew axes. Hypoid gears are crucial to some power {{transmission}} systems, {{such as those of}} helicopters, power generation machines and automobiles. However, the design and manufacturing of hypoid gears are quite difficult. Currently, the major parameters of hypoid gears are calculated, but the geometries of the gears are not fully defined. To machine a hypoid gear, parameters of cutting systems are determined according to the gear design, whereas, settings of CNC machine tools with the machining parameters are also computed. The existing hypoid gears machining methods use the simplified blade model of the cutting systems, resulting in large errors in the machined gears. This new work proposes an accurate approach, to determine the parameters of the cutting system blades, for the face-milling of hypoid gears. In this work, a parametric model of the blades is established; and according to the hypoid gear parameters, the pressure angle and the cutting system radius are precisely calculated. Currently, hypoid gear engineers can use special CAD/CAM software to design the gears and to calculate machine settings. Unfortunately, these software are developed only for particular machine tools; it cannot be used for hypoid <b>gear</b> <b>machine</b> tools of different configurations. Moreover, few technical articles has been published to clearly address challenges in the CNC programming and post-processing for the multi-axis face-milling of hypoid gears, such as the parameters determination of a cutter system, its location and orientation calculation and CNC programs generation. To solve the current problems, another part of this research proposes a generic approach to CNC programming and post-processing for gear face-milling. The main contributions of this part includes (1) a new mathematical model to calculate the cutter system location and orientation and (2) a generic post-processing method to establish the machine kinematics chain and to compute the coordinates of the machine axes in face-milling. This approach provides a general and accurate methodology for the face-milling of hypoid gears on any machine tools and can be directly applied to the hypoid gear manufacturing for better quality...|$|E
40|$|In many {{positive}} displacement machines for high pressure hydraulic applications, the transitions of the displacement chamber {{from the inlet}} and outlet ports is realized through appropriate grooves. These grooves limit undesirable effects due to fluid compressibility such as: the instantaneous pressure peaks or localized cavitation inside the displacement chamber and the increment of port flow fluctuations. These effects result in instabilities and noise emission in these machines. Since the reduction of abovementioned effects is often achieved by a groove design that introduces a certain crossflow between the outlet and the inlet ports, volumetric efficiency is another important parameter {{to be considered in}} the design of such grooves. Typical examples of these grooves are those machined on the valve plate of axial piston machines (often referred as “silencing grooves” or “relief grooves”) or those present on the lateral bushings of external gear machines. The design of these grooves is often performed by the pump or motor manufacturers through empirical or simplified numerical procedures; and a well-established design procedure is not existing. This research presents an effort in formulating and establishing a design procedure to automatically determine the optimal designs of the grooves present on the lateral bushings of the external <b>gear</b> <b>machine</b> units. The optimization of the porting grooves is carried out in two steps, in the first step, optimal area of the connections in meshing region that connects the TSV to the porting grooves is determined; in the second step, a groove morphology is realized which can trace similar area of the connections obtained from step one. The proposed procedure has the important feature of not assuming a certain geometric morphology of the grooves. The proposed procedure does not assume a certain geometric morphology of the grooves, and it solves the multi-objective optimization problem of finding the best designs to simultaneously: 1) minimize flow fluctuations,; 2) minimize internal pressure peaks,; 3) minimize localized cavitation onset and; 4) maximize volumetric efficiency. This design procedure is implemented to optimize the relief grooves of one of the commercial external gear pump and comparisons of important pump performance features have been made. It is observed that the optimized grooves show a reduction of 58 % in the pressure ripple energy compared to the reference grooves. ...|$|E
40|$|Oil {{hydraulics}} {{is widely}} accepted {{as the best}} technology for transmitting power in many engineering applications due to its advantages in power density, control, layout flexibility, and efficiency. Due to these advantages, hydraulic systems are present in many different applications including construction, agriculture, aerospace, automotive, forestry, medical, and manufacturing, just to identify a few. Many of these applications involve the systems {{in close proximity to}} human operators and passengers where noise {{is one of the main}} constraints to the acceptance and spread of this technology. ^ As a key component in power transfer, displacement machines can be major sources of noise in hydraulic systems. Thus, investigation into the sources of noise and discovering strategies to reduce noise is a key part of applying fluid power systems to a wider range of applications, as well as improving the performance of current hydraulic systems. ^ The present research aims to leverage previous efforts and develop new models and experimental techniques in the topic of noise generation caused by hydrostatic units. This requires challenging and surpassing current accepted methods in the understanding of noise in fluid power systems. This research seeks to expand on the previous experimental and modeling efforts by directly considering the effect that system and component design changes apply on the total sound power and the sound frequency components emitted from displacement machines and the attached lines. ^ The case of external gear pumps is taken as reference for a new model to understand the generation and transmission of noise from the sources out to the environment. The lumped parameter model HYGESim (HYdraulic <b>GEar</b> <b>machine</b> Simulator) was expanded to investigate the dynamic forces on the solid bodies caused by the pump operation and to predict interactions with the attached system. Vibration and sound radiation were then predicted using a combined finite element and boundary element vibro-acoustic model as well as the influence of additional models for system components to better understand the essential problems of noise generation in hydraulic systems. This model is a step forward for the field due to the coupling of an advanced internal model of pump operation coupled to a detailed vibro-acoustic model. ^ Several experimental studies were also completed in order to advance the current science. The first study validated the pump model in terms of outlet pressure ripple prediction through comparison to experimentally measured results for the reference pump as well as prototype pumps designed for low outlet pressure ripple. The second study focused on the air-borne noise through sound pressure and intensity measurements on reference and prototype pumps at steady-state operating conditions. A third study over a wide range of operating speeds and pressures was completed to explore the impact of operating condition and system design to greater detail through measuring noise and vibration in the working fluid, the system structures, and the air. ^ Applying the knowledge gained through experimental and simulation studies has brought new advances in the understanding of the physics of noise generation and propagation in hydraulic components and systems. The focus of the combined simulation and modeling approach is to clearly understand the different contributions from noise sources and surpasses the previous methods that focus on the outlet pressure ripple alone as a source of noise. The application of the new modeling and experimental approach allows for new advances which directly contribute to advancing the science of noise in hydraulic applications and the design of new quieter hydrostatic units and hydraulic systems. ...|$|E

The optimal designs for both these applications were identified and their improvements in performance were compared with existing commercial design. Qualitative trends representing the different mutual inter-relationships between the design variables that influence the performance of the machine were also characterized. ...|$|R

Tools as well as kinematics of gear hobbing are quite complex. This paper proposes a comprehensive experimental protocol for machinability testing. This protocol is based on a European standard. Tests are performed on a machine tool using a commercially available cutting tool. Tests provide the range of cutting conditions for five different steel grades.
