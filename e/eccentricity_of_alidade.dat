40|$|Abstract. The <b>eccentricity</b> <b>of</b> a vertex is {{the maximum}} {{distance}} from {{it to another}} vertex and the average <b>eccentricity</b> <b>of</b> a graph is the mean <b>eccentricity</b> <b>of</b> a vertex. In this paper we establish bounds on the mean <b>eccentricity</b> <b>of</b> a graph. We then examine {{the change in the}} average eccentricity when a graph is replaced by a spanning subgraph, in particular the two extreme cases: taking a spanning tree and removing one edge. ...|$|R

When circles (which have eccentricity 0) are counted as ellipses, the <b>eccentricity</b> <b>of</b> an ellipse {{is greater than}} or equal to 0; if circles are given a special category and are excluded from the category of ellipses, then the <b>eccentricity</b> <b>of</b> an ellipse {{is strictly}} greater than 0.|$|R

Besides, it is described how a simple two-axis compensator was constructed, which occupies little space {{and can be}} ideally centrically set in vertical axis of the instrument.

50|$|The <b>eccentricity</b> <b>of</b> the Earth's orbit is {{currently}} about 0.0167; the Earth's orbit is nearly circular. Venus and Neptune have even lower <b>eccentricities.</b> Over hundreds <b>of</b> thousands <b>of</b> years, the <b>eccentricity</b> <b>of</b> the Earth's orbit varies from nearly 0.0034 to almost 0.058 {{as a result}} of gravitational attractions among the planets (see graph).|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the improvement of}} the beam-waveguide antenna pointing accuracy due to the implementation of the track-level-compensation look-up table. It presents the development of the table, from the measurements of the inclinometer tilts to the processing of the measurement data and the determination <b>of</b> the three-axis <b>alidade</b> rotations. The table consists of three axis rotations <b>of</b> the <b>alidade</b> {{as a function of the}} azimuth position. The article also presents the equations to determine the elevation and cross-elevation errors of the antenna as a function <b>of</b> the <b>alidade</b> rotations and the antenna azimuth and elevation positions. The table performance was verified using radio beam pointing data. The pointing error decreased from 4. 5 mdeg to 1. 4 mdeg in elevation and from 14. 5 mdeg to 3. 1 mdeg in cross-elevation. I...|$|R
50|$|The <b>eccentricity</b> <b>of</b> a {{three-dimensional}} quadric is the <b>eccentricity</b> <b>of</b> a designated section of it.

50|$|Closer {{investigation}} using {{a simpler}} model with one planet and a planetesimal disk {{indicated that the}} energy transfer was due to a coupling between the <b>eccentricity</b> <b>of</b> the planetesimals in the outer belt and the semi-major axis of the planet.
