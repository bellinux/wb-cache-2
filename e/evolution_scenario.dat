40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{first-class}} change model for Change-Oriented Software Engineering (COSE). Based on an <b>evolution</b> <b>scenario,</b> we identify {{a lack of}} support in current Interactive Development Environments (IDEs) to apply COSE. We introduce a set of five extensions to an existing model of first-class changes and describe the desired behaviour of change-oriented IDEs to support COSE. With {{the help of an}} <b>evolution</b> <b>scenario,</b> we show why those extensions are required. Finally we describe ChEOPS: a prototypical implementation of a change-oriented IDE on top of VisualWorks and illustrate how it supports the extended first-class change model. ChEOPS is finally used to validate COSE as a solution for the shortcomings of existing IDEs. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} mixture <b>{{evolution}}</b> <b>scenario</b> {{to model the}} evolution of the radio luminosity function (RLF) of steep spectrum AGNs (active galactic nuclei) based on a Bayesian method. In this scenario, the shape of the RLF is determined by both the density and luminosity evolution. Our models indicate that the density evolution is positive until a redshift of 0. 9, at which point it becomes negative, while the luminosity evolution is positive to a higher redshift (z 5 for model B and z 3. 5 for model C), where it becomes negative. Our mixture evolution model works well, and the modeled RLFs are in good agreement with previous determinations. The mixture <b>evolution</b> <b>scenario</b> can naturally explain the luminosity-dependent evolution of the RLFs. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|E

Unfortunately identifying the right set of <b>evolution</b> <b>scenarios</b> is difficult due to the uncertainty of occurrence of future requirements.

Material at resonance in the bar region loses angular momentum which is taken by material at resonance in the outer disc and/or the halo.

40|$|Cost-effective {{software}} {{evolution is}} critical to many distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems. Selecting the lowest cost set of software components that meet DRE system resource constraints, such as total memory and available CPU cycles, is an NP-Hard problem. This paper provides three contributions to R&D on evolving softwareintensive DRE systems. First, we present the Software Evolution Analysis with Resources (SEAR) technique that transforms component-based DRE system evolution alternatives into multidimensional multiple-choice knapsack problems. Second, we compare several techniques for solving these knapsack problems to determine valid, low-cost design configurations for resource constrained component-based DRE systems [...] Third, we empirically evaluate the techniques to determine their applicability {{in the context of}} common <b>evolution</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Based on these findings, we present a taxonomy of the solving techniques and the <b>evolution</b> <b>scenarios</b> that best suit each technique. ...|$|R

Assuring that the investment in reuse holds over time is an important requirement in this case.

Configuration Management is a mature discipline for that purpose. However traditional configuration management does not address product line <b>evolution</b> <b>scenarios</b> explicitly.

40|$|Background: Retrotransposition of mRNA {{transcripts}} gives occasionally rise to functional retrogenes. Through acquiring tempero-spatial expression patterns {{distinct from}} their parental genes and/or functional mutations in their coding sequences, such retrogenes may in principle reshape signalling networks. Results: Here we present evidence {{for such a}} scenario, involving retrogenes of Rap 1 belonging to the Ras family of small GTPases. We identified two murine and one human-specific retrogene of Rap 1 A and Rap 1 B, which encode proteins that differ by only a few amino acids from their parental Rap 1 proteins. Markedly, human hRap 1 B-retro and mouse mRap 1 A-retro 1 acquired mutations in the 12 th and 59 th amino acids, respectively, corresponding to residues mutated in constitutively active oncogenic Ras proteins. Statistical and structural analyses support a functional <b>evolution</b> <b>scenario,</b> where Rap 1 isoforms of retrogenic origin are functionally distinct from their parental proteins. Indeed, all retrogene-encoded GTPases have an increased GTP/GDP binding ratio in vivo, indicating that their conformations resemble that of active GTP-bound Rap 1. We furthermore demonstrate that these three Rap 1 isoforms exhibit distinct affinities for the Ras-binding domain of RalGDS. Finally, when tested for their capacity to induce key cellular processes like integrin-mediated cell adhesion or cell spreading, marked differences are seen. Conclusions: Together, these data lend strong support for an <b>evolution</b> <b>scenario,</b> where retrotransposition an...|$|E
40|$|Following {{previous}} work, we further {{confirm that}} the cosmic evolution of steep-spectrum radio-loud AGNs (active galactic nuclei) can be reproduced by a simple combination of density evolution (DE) and luminosity evolution (LE). This mixture <b>evolution</b> <b>scenario</b> can naturally explain the luminosity-dependent evolution of radio-loud AGNs. Our models successfully fitted {{a large amount of}} data on radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of steep-spectrum sources and multi-frequency source counts. The modeling indicates that the DE slowly increase as (1 +z) ^ 0. 3 1. 3 out to z 0. 8, and then rapidly decreases as (1 +z) ^- 6. 8 - 5. 7, while the LE rapidly increase as (1 +z) ^ 4. 8 out to a higher redshift (at least z> 3. 5). We find a high-redshift decline (i. e. redshift cutoff) in the number density of steep-spectrum radio sources, but we cannot conclude whether such decline is sharp or shallow. We believe that whether a redshift cutoff occurs or not depends mainly on DE, while its steepness is decided by LE, which, however, cannot be well constrained {{due to the lack of}} high-redshift samples. Most intriguingly, according to our mixture <b>evolution</b> <b>scenario,</b> there appears to be no need for different evolution for the low- and high-power radio-loud AGNs. Both types of sources experience the same combined evolution of DE and LE. Comment: ApJ published, 11 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
