40|$|Commercial <b>hospital</b> {{discharge}} <b>packs</b> {{are commonly}} given to new mothers {{at the time}} of newborn hospital discharge. We evaluated the relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and the receipt of commercial <b>hospital</b> dis-charge <b>packs</b> in a population-based sample of Oregon women who initiated breastfeeding before newborn hospital discharge. Methods. We analyzed data from the 2000 and 2001 Oregon Pregnancy Risk As-sessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a population-based survey of postpartum women (n= 3895; unweighted response rate= 71. 6 %). Results. Among women who had initiated breastfeeding, 66. 8 % reported hav-ing received commercial <b>hospital</b> discharge <b>packs.</b> We found that women who re-ceived these packs were more likely to exclusively breastfeed for fewer than 10 weeks than were women who had not received the packs (multivariate adjusted odds ratio= 1. 39; 95 % confidence interval= 1. 05, 1. 84). Conclusions. Commercial <b>hospital</b> discharge <b>packs</b> are one of several factors that influence breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. The distribution of these packs to new mothers at hospitals is part of a longstanding marketing campaign by infant formula manufacturers and implies hospital and staff endorsement of infant formula. Commercial <b>hospital</b> discharge <b>pack</b> distribution should be reconsidered in light of its negative impact on exclusive breastfeeding. (Am...|$|R

Not Since then, this not-for-profit program has expanded into many low-income communities, fielding a combination of educational enrichment, team and fitness-oriented athletics, and community service activities where GOALS youth help others. While GOALS is by far the worldwide leader in providing ice hockey access for minority children, the program has taken major strides in other sports opportunities such as lacrosse, soccer, tennis and roller hockey. Currently, the program involves more than 2,000 youth ages six to nineteen each year. GOALS operates indoor and outdoor facilities and a bus fleet, and provides all necessary equipment, insurance, coaching, teaching, and supplies all at no charge to participating youth. GOALS organizes activities within designated under served communities and links those areas to central GOALS facilities with a community bus network. One of the hallmarks of the GOALS program is that youth are required to serve through a [...] "Summer of Service" [...] in an innovative arm of the program called GOALS Cadets. This initiative leads efforts to read storybooks to children in school, clean up parks, paint out graffiti, through a program called GOALS CityPride, coach disabled young people through GOALS Special Sports, visit veterans at local VA <b>hospitals,</b> and <b>pack</b> food for local food distribution centers that support the poor.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Two self-expandable stents, the Neuroform and the Enterprise stent, {{are widely}} used for stent-assisted coiling (SAC) of complex shaped {{intracranial}} aneurysms. However, comparative knowledge about technical feasibility, peri- and post-procedural morbidity and mortality, packing densities as well as follow-up data is limited. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to investigate differences in aneurysms stented with the Enterprise or Neuroform stents. Angiographic follow-up (mean 19. 42 months) was available in 72. 6 % (61 / 84) of aneurysms treated with stent-assisted coiling. We further sought to compare stent-assisted coiling to a matched patient population with aneurysms treated by conventional coil embolization. RESULTS: The stenting success rate of the Enterprise was higher compared to the Neuroform stent (46 / 48 and 42 / 51, respectively). In 5 of 9 {{cases in which the}} Neuroform stent was not navigable to the landing zone, we successfully deployed an Enterprise stent instead. Eventually, 42 aneurysms were coiled after stenting in each group. We observed no significant differences in peri-procedural complication rate, post-procedural <b>hospital</b> stay, <b>packing</b> density, recurrence rate or number of in-stent stenosis. Strikingly, 36. 1 % of followed aneurysms in the SAC group showed progressive occlusion on angiographic follow-up imaging. The packing density was significantly higher in aneurysms treated by SAC as compared to conventionally coiled aneurysms, while recanalization rate was significantly lower in the SAC group. CONCLUSION: The procedural success rate is higher using the Enterprise, but otherwise both stents exhibited similar characteristics. Lower recurrence frequency and complication rates comparable to conventional coil embolization emphasize the importance of stent-assisted coiling in the treatment of complex aneurysms. Progressive occlusion on angiographic follow-up was a distinct and frequent observation in the SAC group and may in part be due to flow diversion...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{stability}} is greatly {{affected by the}} environmental conditions especially temperature and humidity. WHO classified Sudan as zone III and recently in 2006 it had been classified by EMRO as zone III and zone IVA. As the climatic conditions in Sudan varies from one region to another, the study aimed at comparing these conditions with the internationally adopted conditions, to investigate the true transportation and storage conditions and their effects on the stability of justifiably selected drug products. The methodology was based on selecting six stations representing different climatic regions and six baskets of nine products together with Dataloggers were delivered to each station. Dataloggers measured and recorded temperature and humidity every 90 minutes during transportation and storage. The products had been tested initially, after transportation, after six months and lastly after 12 months using validated pharmacopoeial methods. The MKT for each station was calculated using data from Dataloggers, data from the adopted meteorological records and meteorological records {{for the same period}} of the study by the aid of stability system II, Scienteck MKT program. The resulted MKT for Sudan using the past adopted meteorological records is 31 °C and 34 °C when using the meteorological records for the same period of the study but the MKT of the controlled room temperature was 26 °C to 29 °C. The RH was higher in Portsudan, Damazin and Juba while the {{other parts of the country}} were very dry. The transportation MKTs for all stations were above 30 °C. Almost all utilized products showed significant alternation in the concentrations of the active ingredients. The results had been analyzedusing SPSS, Statistica and Excel software programs to compare the MKTs and to estimate the shelf lives of the products and the following findings were concluded: 1 - WHO used the mean of the past adoptedmeteorological records on calculating the MKT for Sudan and it was significantly different from the past and parallel meteorological records of four stations and it did not reflect the true picture of the actual storage conditions because of man interventions to improve the storage conditions. The mean temperature recorded by meteorological authority for the same period of the study was 3. 89 °C above that recorded by Dataloggers, and the room v average RH was 6 - 7 % lower than that of the open air. The most drastic and severe conditions for drugs were the transportation conditions which were almost above 40 C° contradicting EMRO recommendation which specified 30 C° as maximum temperature for transportation. 2 - All products were labeled to be stored below 25 C°, none of the storage facilities could maintain this MKT resulting in a significant decrease in their shelf-lives. 3 - With exception of metronidazole I. V in glass containers, all drug products utilized showed marked stability problems losing fraction of their shelf lives, which is attributed to the drastic transportation conditions, inappropriate storage conditions and some of them was due to quality of the products. 4 - Plastic containers for parenteral aqueous fluids and tablets in <b>hospital</b> <b>packs</b> may not withstand the environmental conditions of Sudan. It was recommended that the conditions pointed out by EMRO could be acceptable as an in-house MKT and the RH could be accepted with exclusion of liquid preparation in plastic container. DRA should take immediate actions regarding transportation conditions and it should instruct the reference laboratory to perform such stability studies for all registered products on the basis of EMRO guidelines especially for calculations of the shelf lives. It was also recommended to use the Dataloggers in-house MKT as a global method to determine the storage condition all over the world and if only the meteorological records would have adopted, the MKT for Sudan might be 34...|$|R

We used a prospective, open-label {{randomized}} {{trial to}} evaluate two treatment regimens in Tanzanian children {{two months to}} four years of age presenting to a <b>hospital</b> with a <b>packed</b> cell volume (PCV) < 25 %. Treatment was either standard (14 days of ferrous sulfate and an antimalarial) or extended (three months of ferrous sulfate and three antimalarial treatments). The prevalence of anemia was measured two weeks after completion of treatment and six months after recruitment. Two weeks after completing treatment, the prevalence of PCV < 33 % was 58 % in the standard treatment arm and 44 % in the extended treatment group (P 0. 04), and the mean PCV was significantly higher in the extended treatment arm (32. 1 %, SD 4. 5 % versus 30. 8 %, SD 4. 9 %; P 0. 031). However, {{there was no difference}} in the prevalence of PCV < 25 % in the first survey, and the benefits of extended therapy were only apparent six months after recruitment in children compliant with the extended treatment (odds ratio of PCV < 25 % 0. 16, P 0. 06). Compliance was satisfactory in only 39 % (82 of 209) of the children in the first week of treatment. Extending the duration of therapy and improving compliance may have health benefits for anemic children in malaria-endemic settings...|$|R
40|$|Problem: Significant {{deficiencies}} {{exist in}} {{the knowledge and skills}} of medical students and residents around health care quality and safety. The theory and practice of quality and safety should be embedded into undergraduate medical practice so that health care professionals are capable of developing interventions and innovations to effectively anticipate and mitigate errors. Approach: Since 2011, Leeds Medical School in the United Kingdom has used case study examples of nasogastric (NG) tube patient safety incidents within the undergraduate patient safety curriculum. In 2012, a medical undergraduate student approached a clinician with an innovative idea after undertaking an NG tubes root cause analysis case study. Simultaneously, a separate local project demonstrated low compliance (11. 6 %) with the United Kingdom's National Patient Safety Agency NG tubes guideline for use of the correct method to check tube position. These separate endeavors led to interdisciplinary collaboration between a medical student, health care professionals, researchers, and industry to develop the Initial Placement Nasogastric Tube Safety Pack. Outcomes: Human factors engineering was used to inform pack design to allow guideline recommendations to be accessible and easy to follow. A timeline of product development, mapped against key human factors and medical device design principles used throughout the process, is presented. The safety pack has since been launched in five UK National Health Service (NHS) <b>hospitals,</b> and the <b>pack</b> has been introduced into health care professional staff training for NG tubes. Next steps: A mixed-methods evaluation is currently under way in five NHS organizations. 5 page(s...|$|R
40|$|My central {{hypothesis}} is that receiving and accessing food in the hospital context is problematic for the older inpatient. ‘Food as medicine’ is an important concept. Many older people enter hospital {{in a state of}} malnutrition, or are ‘at risk’ of malnutrition and several studies have found that they leave hospital in a worse state than when they entered [6]. Food in hospitals needs to be nourishing, appealing and accessible to all the patients to encourage them to eat and take in valuable nutrition to aid in their recovery from illness. Access to food must consider the total picture – the environment in which it is served, the posture of the patient and their ability to actually access the food product to harness its nutritional value. For feasibility reasons, older community dwelling adults participated in the research involving <b>hospital</b> food <b>packs.</b> The thesis used an ergonomics approach to examine the interface of the well, community dwelling older person with hospital food and beverage package and its context of use. As the pilot study [5] within a hospital environment had established that food and beverage packaging served in hospital presented challenges to older inpatients, it was decided to explore the issue in depth with well older people through a series of three studies. Hand function measured through grip strength, pinch strength, and dexterity and satisfaction with pack performance measured using a questionnaire. Efficiency of pack opening was also measured with time and attempts captured through video recording. Context of use was assessed by measuring hand function and efficiency of pack opening in two postures, sitting in a chair and lying down in a hospital bed. The important nutritional aspect of packaged food and beverages was captured through a comparison of dietary intake when packaging was presented as pre-opened or sealed. The studies were conducted in the community (Study 1) and a simulated hospital laboratory (Studies 2 and 3). The research used an integrated methodology and was iterative and inductive, with each study informing the next. Study 1 assessed the complete range of hospital food and beverage packs with older people in the community setting, measuring grip and pinch strength; time and attempts to open the pack; as well as overall satisfaction with the pack. Study 2 expanded the research to include patient dexterity and the environmental context of the hospital environment, lying in a hospital bed. Study 3 again built upon the research by including grip, pinch strength, dexterity, time and attempts to open packs, satisfaction with packs, measurement of nutritional status and actual dietary intake when packs were served pre-opened and sealed...|$|R

Despite Dawn's own shock and pleas for mercy, an enraged Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) immediately pulls out his own pistol and shoots her in the head, killing her. The resulting stand-off is defused by Shepherd, who tells the remaining officers to hold their fire. She insists that Dawn was the problem all along, and that it is all over now that she is dead. Dr. Edwards (Erik Jensen) offers to let Rick and his group stay at the hospital, but Rick declines. Instead, he offers anyone in the hospital who wants to leave to join his group, but only Noah accepts. As they exit the hospital, they encounter the rest of the group.

5000|$|At {{the dawn}} of the nuclear age, {{evacuation}} was opposed by the federal government. The Federal Civil Defense Administration produced a short movie called Our Cities Must Fight. It argued that {{in the event of a}} nuclear war, people need to stay in cities to help repair the infrastructure and man the recovering industries. [...] "Nuclear radiation," [...] it advised, [...] "would only stay in the air a day or two."Despite this early opposition, evacuation plans were soon created. One city at the forefront of such efforts was Portland, Oregon. In 1955, their city government completed [...] "Operation Greenlight"—a drill to evacuate the city center. <b>Hospital</b> patients were <b>packed</b> into semi-trucks, pedestrians were picked up by passing motorists, and the city's construction equipment and emergency vehicles were rushed out to [...] "dispersal points." [...] The entire city center was evacuated in 19 minutes. [...] On December 8, 1957 CBS Television aired a dramatization of how a well prepared city might respond to an imminent nuclear attack. The show,A Day Called 'X', produced [...] "in co-operation with the Federal Civil Defense Administration," [...] was shot in Portland, using City officials and ordinary citizens instead of professional actors. It was narrated by Glenn Ford. [...] Such plans were plausible in the early days of the Cold War, when an attack would have come from strategic bombers, which would have allowed a warning of many hours, not to mention the high possibility of interception by anti-air systems and fighters. The development of Intercontinental ballistic missiles made this goal less realistic, however. Despite that, civil defense officials still worked to prepare evacuation plans. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan announced the Crisis Relocation Plan. The White House suggested that the $10 billion, five-year program could allow the evacuation of targeted urban centers to rural [...] "host areas" [...] and thus save 80% of the population. The plan allowed up to three days for the evacuation to be completed, believing that a nuclear war would not come in a surprise attack but rather as the culmination of a crisis period of rising tensions.|$|R
40|$|This project {{centered}} on inventory optimization for operative custom surgical packs and soft good supplies for Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), a 947 -bed medical center. Custom surgical packs {{are used in}} every surgical case and delivered to the hospital by a vendor who manufactures them off site. These large packs contain unwrapped surgical items (drapes, gown, sutures, etc.) delivered to each operating room {{prior to the start}} of surgery. Once a surgical pack is opened, the items inside are consumed or wasted. MGH uses the custom packs to reduce the amount of time warehouse associates spend picking individual items and to reduce preparation time in the operating rooms prior to the patient arriving. To augment the custom packs, individually packaged and sterilized items (called soft goods) are requested by the surgeon for each case. Specific case information, surgeon's preferences for materials, and patient needs dictate these soft good supply requirements. Soft goods are ordered from separate vendors and together with the custom packs comprise a surgeon's preference card. The <b>hospital</b> orders custom <b>packs</b> and soft goods with the intent to keep three days of supply on hand or to fill shelf space, whichever is greater. This situation triggers bloated and redundant inventory stores throughout MGH. Despite the sub-optimality of this policy, no analysis had informed hospital leadership of the correct levels of inventory or the best ways to cover preference cards. To solve these challenges, we formalized an optimization model that minimized the purchasing and holding costs of custom packs and soft goods while satisfying the supply requirements of all preference cards. As an input, the model used all current pack configurations and new pack configurations born from the overlaps of current surgical packs. Base stock reductions are achievable through covering "sibling" procedures with the new combined pack configurations and picking displaced items as soft goods. The model results revealed a modular pack structure as the most cost effective method to cover all preference cards. The new modular pack structure prescribed replacing 14 of the 65 current packs with 16 smaller packs to reduce overall value of inventory on hand. Currently, we estimate that this work will save the hospital in excess of $ 1. 3 M annually by reducing inventory on the shelf and lowering associated holding costs through risk pooling. by Matthew R.
