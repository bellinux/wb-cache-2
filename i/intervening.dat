5|$|Ambassador Bishop clearly {{explained}} his rationale {{to the security}} detail, which was to avoid any impression that they were <b>intervening</b> in the violence in Mogadishu. He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes {{got the impression that}} the US was <b>intervening</b> in the conflict. To this effect, he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict.

5|$|In June 1457 he was {{personally}} responsible for <b>intervening</b> {{in the activities of}} Bishop Pecock, a virulent anti-Lollard. However, his virulence led to suspicions of heresy, which resulted in Beaumont's instigation of a formal examination into the bishop's sermons and writings; Peckock agreed to recant and abjured his heresy in November 1457, resigning his bishopric a year later.|$|E
40|$|Cyber {{harassment}} {{can have}} harmful effects {{on social media}} users, such as emotional distress and, consequently, withdrawal from social network sites or even life itself. At the same time, users are often upset when network providers <b>intervene</b> and deem such an intrusion an unjust occurrence. This article analyzes how decisions to <b>intervene</b> can be communicated {{in such a way}} that users consider them adequate and acceptable. A first experiment shows that informational justice perceptions of social network users depend on the format in which network providers present the decision to <b>intervene.</b> More specifically, if a decision to <b>intervene</b> is presented in the form of a story, as opposed to an analytical rendering of facts and arguments, decisions to <b>intervene</b> prompt more positive informational justice perceptions. A second experiment reveals that when users relate the experience to themselves, narrative transportation increases, which positively affects perceptions of the justice of decisions to <b>intervene...</b>|$|R

5|$|Nine years earlier, Tchaikovsky had penned a {{ruthless}} dissection of The Five for Nadezhda von Meck. At that time, his feelings of personal isolation and professional insecurity {{had been at}} their strongest. In the nine <b>intervening</b> years, Mussorgsky and Borodin had both died, Balakirev had banished himself to the musical sidelines, and Cui's critical missives had lost much of their sting for Tchaikovsky. Rimsky-Korsakov {{was the only one}} left who was fully active as a composer, and much had changed in the <b>intervening</b> years between him and Tchaikovsky as a result of Rimsky-Korsakov's change in musical values. Tchaikovsky had also changed. More secure as a composer and less isolated personally than {{he had been in the}} past, Tchaikovsky enjoyed the company he now kept with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov, and found much to enjoy in their music.|$|E
