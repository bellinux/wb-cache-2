40|$|In {{heavy section}} cast iron components, {{anomalous}} microstructures can be formed {{especially at the}} core, because of low cooling rate, with a consequent decrease in mechanical properties. The matrix microstructure, the presence of surface defects, such as inclusions and porosities, and the size and morphology of graphite nodules are critical issues to ensure the adequate performance of the component in fatigue applications. Proper design of heavy section ductile iron castings requires a database of information about microstructures and mechanical properties that nowadays is missing or is very poor. In this paper, we presented the mechanical characterization of ductile irons with solidification times up to 20 h, carried out to identify the metallurgical and the process parameters that most affect the improvement in fatigue strength. An innovative production line was designed, aimed at reproducing on a small-scale sample the characteristics of heavy walled components. A standard ferritic ductile cast iron compared to a <b>ferritic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with high silicon content and a fully pearlitic ductile cast iron were studied by tensile, Brinell hardness and rotating bending fatigue tests. Optical microscope analysis and scanning electron microscope observations {{of the most significant}} fracture surfaces were also performed. It was concluded that the <b>ferritic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> is more suitable for the production of large thickness castings undergoing fatigue loads, because the decrease in ductility and its effect on other properties is less pronounced...|$|E
40|$|Physical modells of {{microstructural}} {{processes in}} laser surface hardening and melting, resp., are proposed: Pearlite dissolution is performed at a transformation front running with a speed which {{is controlled by}} the carbon diffusion balance. The carbon diffusion path from the dissolving carbides to the front has large influence on the front propagation speed and on the shape of the interface between ferrite and austenite in a pearlite lamella, which may be observed by means of REM. In most ferrous materials this diffusion path is found to run through the austenite, in unalloyed pearlitic steels with low interlamellar spacing, however, it is running through the ferrite yielding a very large speed of the transformation front, which has been estimated. Furthermore, the remelting of <b>ferritic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> is discussed to be controlled by the carbon diffusion balance at an austenitizing/melting double front system.

40|$|The current paper {{focuses on}} {{development}} of a method for studying micro-scale strains on the microstructure of <b>ferritic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> For this purpose, in-situ tensile tests were done under the optical microscope combined with digital image correlation (DIC). Critical in this development was {{to be able to}} achieve a reliable high spatial resolution of strain around microstructural features, such as graphite particles. Measurement of local strain fi elds in cast iron materials have so far been relying on displacement of naturally occurring microstructure patterns such as graphite particles, which limits the spatial resolution of strain measurement. In order to increase the spatial resolution of the measured strain, a pit etching procedure was applied to generate a random speckle pattern on the ferritic matrix. Th e critical challenges of in-situ investigation of microstructural deformation were identifi ed as speckle pattern quality and accurate selection of subset size and strain window size.

The precipitate phase at grain boundaries in vanadium alloyed specimens was identified as vanadium carbide (VC 1 -x) and the stoichiometry of the eutectic carbide was almost same as that in Si-Mo <b>ferritic</b> ductile <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> except for a higher vanadium content.

40|$|The {{ferritic}} {{ductile iron}} (FCD 400) {{is widely used}} as industrial material. As regards to its high temperature application, fatigue at elevated temperature, and advanced mechanical properties has been investigated and clarified. In low cycle fatigue (LCF), the S-N curve is presented by the relation of plastic strain {{to the number of}} cycles as fatigue life, which can be predicted by the Manson-Coffinmodel. In this model, the ductile index is appointed as a material constant of 0. 5 and the ductile coefficient is related directly to the so-called plastic deformation capacity of the material. Namely, the low cycle fatigue life shall be dominated by the elongation rate. Concerned with it, one of authors reported that the elongation-to-fracture is 20 % at room temperature, but reduces to about 9 % at 473 K. This temperature is just within the range of dynamic strain ageing (DSA), which is the phenomenon of fluctuating stress due to mobile atoms in solid solution. So, in this study, strain controlled high temperature LCF-tests were carried out on <b>ferritic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> at 473 K in air and the result is compared with those performed at room temperature, aiming to clarify the effect of elongation or DSA on the fatigue life.

The fatigue life time at 473 K is 175 cycles lower than that at 293 K for all stress levels. However, DSA phenomena did not occur at high strain in 473 K cyclic fatigue test although it cannot be observed in tensile tests at 473 K.

40|$|AbstractWith the aim {{to improve}} the {{tribological}} behaviour of a high performance component made of a <b>ferritic</b> ductile <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> (GJS 400 - 12), a laser surface modification treatment by a solid-state laser beam is proposed. The induced microstructural modifications have been investigated in a previous experimental work by means of experimental tests in various process conditions. It was thus possible to verify that the achieved hardness profile {{is a function of}} the energy density delivered towards the surface and that the process shows a saturation phenomenon when melting occurs. Depending on the available process power and the interaction time for microstructural modification, the higher energy density determines the deeper transformation: initially related to the diffusion mechanisms in the solid matter and then due to the melting of the outer layers. In the present study, the tribological behaviour of the laser remelted ductile <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> was compared to the base material in order to evaluate the performance enhancement. The highest achieved value of the surface hardness was selected for the tests.

A series of investigations concerning the influence of microsegregation on mechanical properties of :pearlitic, ferritic and austenitic nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> have then been reported. The influence of section size on the tensile and impact properties of cornmercial purity and refined <b>ferritic</b> nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> has been studied. It has been shown. that an increase in section caused a decrease in impact transition temperature of the commercial purity material without greatly affecting the impact transition temperature of the purer material. This effect has been related to increased amounts of segregation effects such as cell boundary carbides in heavier sections of the commercial purity material. Microsegregation studies on the materials used in this thesis have been carried out using an electron probe microanalyser. This technique has shown that concentrations of chromium and manganese and depletions of nickel and silicon occurred at eutectic cell boundaries in nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and were often associated with brittle carbides in these areas. These effects {{have been shown to be}} more prevalent in heavier sections. The nature of segregation during the solidification of nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> has been studied by quenching samples of nodular iron during the solidification process. Micro-analysis of such samples has shown that segregation of manganese and chromium occurs by a gradual build-up of these elements at the solid/liquid interface.

Micro-analysis of samples of the 4 per cent manganese material quenched during solidification revealed that manganese concentrated in the liquid and that nickel concentrated in the solid during solidification.

Inicialmente, amostras do material foram fundidas em areia com e sem o uso de resfriadores. Após a fundição, algumas amostras de ambas as condições de resfriamento sofreram normalização, enquanto outras foram recozidas, perfazendo seis diferentes condições microestruturais: sem resfriador bruta de fundição (SRB); sem resfriador normalizada (SRN); sem resfriador recozida (SRR); com resfriador bruta de fundição (CRB); com resfriador normalizada (CRN) e com resfriador recozida (CRR).

Dando continuação a etapa experimental, levantaramse as curvas tensão versus número de ciclos para a falha das condições microestruturais SRB, SRR, CRB e CRR, por meio de ensaios de fadiga em flexão rotativa.

The {{objectives of the}} present work were to promote microstructural variations in an ASTM A 536 60 - 40 - 18 <b>ferritic</b> nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> making use of cast coolers during and adopting heat treatments after casting, {{as well as to}} evaluate the influence of the microstructural variations on the mechanical properties and fatigue life of the material. Initially, samples of the material were cast in sand moulds with and without internal coolers. After casting, a number of samples in both cooling conditions were subjected to normalizing and annealing heat treatments and, therefore, six different microstructural conditions were obtained: as- cast without cooler (SRB), normalized without cooler (SRN), annealed without cooler (SRR), as-cast with cooler (CRB), normalized with cooler (CRN) and annealed with cooler (CRR). Tensile test were carried out on specimens representing the above mentioned conditions and their microstructures were analysed by qualitative and quantitative metallography. In the sequence of the experimental procedure, rotating bend fadigue test were performed in order to establish the stress-life curves for the SRB, SRR, CRB and CRR microstructural conditions. The fadigue life of the material was also related to the metallurgical characteristics of each condition. The metallographic analysis has indicated that the use of coolers increases the number of graphite nodules, reduces the graphite nodule size and otimizes the spherical morphology. However, these microstructural modifications seam to have no significant influence on the mechanical properties of the material. As to the effect of normalizing annealing, boht treatments not imply in significant changes in the mechanical properties of the as-cast conditions. Regarding the fadigue resistance of the material in the as-cast conditions, the CRB sample showed a longer fatigue life than the SRB samples and this performance under cyclic loading was attributed {{to the fact that the}} CRB condition is characterized by a higher number of graphite nodules of class VI. A comparison between the as-cast and annealed conditions indicated that the microstructural conditions SRR and CRR presented a lower fatigue resistance than the conditions SRB and CRB, respectively. This behaviour was associated with the microstructural features of the as-cast conditions, namely the smaller graphite nodule size, the higher microhardness of the matrix and the presence of the bull`s-eye structure.

One way to improve their lifespan is to develop new materials solutions. Estimating thermo-mechanical fatigue resistance of new materials can be performed with a specific test machine developed by CTIF, associating a multi-position wheel, an induction heating and a cooling by air blowing. Test consists in measuring the number of thermal cycles corresponding to the first crack appearance and to the complete failure of a specific versatile sample. Two examples of studies performed with this machine are shown hereafter. First tests were performed to compare the thermo-mechanical fatigue resistance of different grades of <b>ferritic</b> spheroidal graphite <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> These materials are an interesting alternative to alloyed steels or nickel-alloyed <b>cast</b> <b>irons,</b> for the constitution of exhaust manifolds and turbine housings working in the upper-middle temperatures (up to 950 °C).

Truck brakes dissipate several megajoules of energy every few seconds, which leads to high thermal stresses in the rubbing discs. Therefore, truck brake discs are mainly damaged by thermal fatigue cracking. One improvement way is to evolve disc material with the aim of increasing their thermal fatigue resistance while keeping the braking performance. For the thermal fatigue tests being as close as possible to real brake conditions, a specific geometry of sample and inductor was developed, to reproduce the thermal gradients observed during tests on real brake discs.

In this study, effect of chill formation {{on the surface of}} grey and nodular <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> is investigated on the wear behavior, hardness, impact toughness and microstructure of grey and nodular <b>cast</b> <b>irons.</b> For this purpose, four types cam shaft made of grey <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with and without chill on the surfaces and nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with and without chill on the surfaces, were casted. Mechanical tests were conducted after the camshafts have been produced by casting method. Surface hardness and wear resistance of grey and nodular <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> have been improved by chill formation on the surfaces and it is concluded that the amount of wear on the surfaces of grey <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with chill and nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with chill is almost the same. Maximum hardness value was obtained on the surface of grey <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with chill. The impact toughness has been found to decrease by chill formation. Maximum impact toughness value was obtained on nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> Microstructures of grey <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with and without chill and nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with and without chill were examined under optical microscope and worn surfaces of <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Wear mechanisms of the four types of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> were evaluated by SEM examination.

High niobium <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> was prepared by adding pure niobium to a commercial <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> Coarse primary niobium carbide crystals were observed in the microstructure of the <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> The effect of the high niobium <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> as an inoculant on the grain size of austenitic and ferritic stainless steels was examined in various experimental conditions. When the amount of the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> inoculant more than 3 mass% was added into the steel melt, fine equiaxed grains were observed and grain size was significantly reduced to 210 μm. The results indicate that the high niobium <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> is effective as a grain refiner for the austenitic and ferritic stainless steels. From the dissolution rate measurement, the grain refining mechanism was proposed. 9 th International Symposium on Science and Processing of <b>Cast</b> <b>Iron,</b> SPCI- 9; Luxor; 10 November 2010 through 13 November 201...|$|R

This choice was {{dictated by the}} temperatures used {{in the practice of}} nitriding. Nodular graphite in <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> was obtained with use of Inmold process. <b>Cast</b> <b>iron</b> containing molybdenum and copper ensuring obtaining an ausferrite in the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> matrix without the use of heat treatment of castings was tested. The effect of annealing temperature on the microstructure and the kind of fracture of the ausferritic nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> was presented. The effect of an annealing temperature on hardness, impact strength and the microhardness of ausferritic nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> matrix was shown too. The lamellar structure of phases in the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> matrix after annealing has been ascertained. There has been an increase in hardness of an annealed <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and microhardness of its matrix. The reduction in the impact strength of the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> annealed at 520 and 550 °C was approximately 10 - 30 %. Both an increase in the hardness of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> as well as an decrease in its impact strength is probably due to the separation of secondary carbides during the heat treatment...|$|R
