5|$|In fact, Squall and {{the heroes}} do help Ultimecia start Time Compression, {{but they do}} so to confront her in her own time. After Squall and his party defeat Sorceress Adel, Adel {{transfers}} <b>her</b> <b>power</b> to Rinoa, then Ultimecia possesses Rinoa again, and Ellone uses <b>her</b> <b>power</b> to send their consciousness to the past, at which point Ultimecia starts Time Compression. At that moment, the heroes are able to travel to Ultimecia's distant future and defeat her. After the final battle, the defeated Ultimecia transfers her powers to Edea.|$|E
5|$|When 74 Ts {{turbines}} {{were initially}} installed, {{the problems with}} them were so significant that all <b>her</b> <b>power</b> and propulsion machinery had to be rebuilt. She was launched {{for a second time}} on 26 June 1914.|$|E
5|$|A larger {{outbreak}} occurs {{elsewhere in}} the city, and the virus further evolves to mimic the nanomachines' abilities. Yuuji delays the creatures' advance as Ai creates the projected being and uses all of <b>her</b> <b>power</b> to purge the infected area of the virus. Yuuji and Ai are later discharged from CURE and spend time together, free from their duties at last.|$|E
50|$|Due to the Scarlet Witch's magic, Miranda {{is one of}} {{the many}} mutants to lose <b>her</b> <b>powers</b> after the events of Decimation. While she was a prostitute when she had <b>her</b> <b>powers,</b> she never {{actually}} slept with anyone for money, relying on <b>her</b> pheromone <b>powers.</b> Since she lost <b>her</b> <b>powers,</b> this has apparently changed.|$|R
50|$|Loa is very {{reluctant}} to use <b>her</b> <b>powers</b> unless absolutely necessary. This stems from the destructive nature of <b>her</b> <b>powers</b> and past experiences.|$|R
50|$|The {{protector}} of earth. She sealed Deusmast and his minions before losing <b>her</b> <b>powers,</b> thus creating both Magical Realm and Non-Magic Realm. <b>Her</b> <b>powers</b> were inherited to Kotoha.|$|R
5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils {{of the world in}} the box, she placed <b>her</b> <b>power</b> of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return <b>her</b> <b>power,</b> saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E
5|$|Alisia {{attacks by}} {{shooting}} streaks of lightning from her hands. The attack automatically targets enemies in range but gets weaker with each volley as Alisia's power is depleted. <b>Her</b> <b>power</b> recharges when she stops attacking; when fully charged, it {{allows her to}} unleash a multi-target attack, hitting every enemy on the screen. The energy system introduces an element of strategy, encouraging the player to manage Alisia's power to have her able to defend herself at critical moments.|$|E
5|$|Although the Boleyn {{family still}} held {{important}} {{positions on the}} Privy Council, Anne had many enemies, including the Duke of Suffolk. Even her own uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, had come to resent her attitude to <b>her</b> <b>power.</b> The Boleyns preferred France over the Emperor as a potential ally, but the King's favour had swung towards the latter (partly because of Cromwell), damaging the family's influence. Also opposed to Anne were supporters of reconciliation with Princess Mary (among them the former supporters of Catherine), who had reached maturity. A second annulment was now a real possibility, although it is commonly {{believed that it was}} Cromwell's anti-Boleyn influence that led opponents to look for a way of having her executed.|$|E
50|$|Minako has had <b>her</b> <b>powers</b> {{the longest}} of the Sailor Soldiers, {{and because of}} this, Jennifer Brown {{suggests}} that her sense of self-worth is more connected to her confidence in <b>her</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Extremely tall for her gender, Hoshikawa is an esper, but {{not able}} to {{completely}} control <b>her</b> <b>powers</b> of telekinesis, teleportation (of small objects), object reading, and advanced intuition. She relies more on her combat expertise than <b>her</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|R

Erinys eventually found Kratos in the Mounts of Aroania, and after a land battle, an aerial battle ensued as Erinys shape shifted into an enormous bird before being killed by Kratos, after which, Kratos took <b>her</b> <b>power,</b> the Scourge of Erinys. The character was overdub voiced by Jennifer Hale and Erin Torpey in Ghost of Sparta.|$|E

5|$|Married people, however, {{are advised}} not to worship Dhumavati. It {{is said that}} her worship creates a feeling of wanting {{solitude}} and distaste of worldly things, which is considered as highest characteristics of a spiritual quest. Thus, Dhumavati's worship is appropriate for world renouncers who roam as lone wanderers and widows who parallel the life of world renouncers. Dhumavati is also described a being partial to single persons and especially partial to widows. Widows are considered the only beings who can withstand <b>her</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Miss Vanity is Veronica, {{who gained}} <b>her</b> <b>powers</b> through unknown means (they {{appear to be}} stress-related). <b>Her</b> <b>powers</b> are roughly similar to Superteen's, {{although}} her outfit is more provocative.

5|$|Once Tamar {{succeeded in}} {{consolidating}} <b>her</b> <b>power</b> {{and found a}} reliable support in David Soslan, the Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli, Toreli, and other noble families, she revived the expansionist foreign policy of her predecessors. Repeated occasions of dynastic strife in Georgia combined with the efforts of regional successors of the Great Seljuq Empire, such as the Ildenizid atabegs of Azerbaijan, Shirvanshahs, and the Ahlatshahs, had slowed down the dynamic of the Georgians achieved during the reigns of Tamar's great-grandfather, David IV, and her father, George III. However, the Georgians became again active under Tamar, more prominently in the second decade of her rule.|$|E

5|$|Samus is a playable {{character}} {{throughout the}} Super Smash Bros. series of multiplayer fighting games, {{where she can}} use her array of weapons in combat against characters from other Nintendo franchises. Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U also feature an alternate form of Samus called Zero Suit Samus, in which she wears her Zero Suit instead of <b>her</b> <b>Power</b> Suit, which in turn grants her a significantly different set of movements, attacks and even a separate final smash.|$|E
5|$|The {{developer}} and {{producer of the}} original Metroid for the Nintendo Entertainment System – Nintendo Research & Development 1 (Nintendo R) and Gunpei Yokoi – returned to develop Metroid II. The developers of the game added round metal shoulders on Samus' Varia Suit to differentiate it from <b>her</b> <b>Power</b> Suit, since both looked similar on the Game Boy's limited greyscale display.

A unique color palette for Metroid II was added to the Game Boy Color console, a successor to the original Game Boy with a color screen.|$|E
