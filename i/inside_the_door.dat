25|$|The Lords Chamber is {{the site}} of nationally {{televised}} ceremonies, the most important of which is the State Opening of Parliament, which is held formally to open each annual parliamentary session, either after a General Election or in the autumn. At this occasion every constitutional element of the government is represented: the Crown (both literally, and figuratively in the person of the Sovereign), The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and The Commons, (who together form the Legislature), the Judiciary (although no judges are members of either House of Parliament), and the Executive (both Government Ministers, and ceremonial military units in attendance on the Sovereign); and a large number of guests are invited to attend in the large Royal Gallery immediately outside the Chamber. The Sovereign, seated on the Throne, delivers the Speech from the Throne, outlining the Government's programme for the year and legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session. The Commons may not enter the Lords' debating floor; instead, they watch the proceedings from beyond the Bar of the House, just <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> A small purely formal ceremony is held to end each parliamentary session, when the Sovereign is merely represented by a group of Lords Commissioners.|$|E

25|$|St Paul's Anglican Cathedral, {{built in}} 1894 {{and the oldest}} church {{building}} in the city still in use, is a modest parish church {{on the periphery of}} the central business district whose parish dates from 1883. It has been the designated cathedral church of the Anglican Diocese of Qu'Appelle, comprising most of Southern Saskatchewan, since 1944 when it supplanted the original pro-cathedral of St Peter's in the eponymous town of Qu'Appelle. It was then assumed that St. Paul's would remain pro-cathedral temporarily and that plans would be fulfilled to build a substantial cathedral at the corner of College Avenue and Broad Street: the site remains obvious, with hedges planted about the planned building, its liturgical west end at the corner of the intersection. However, by 1974 the diocese reached the conclusion that this outcome was improbable, and St. Paul's Pro-Cathedral was designated Cathedral. Indeed, its organ console being on the liturgical and geographical south end of the choir, just <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> into the chapel and the pipes on the north side, the choir was moved to the north transept with a new Casavant Frères organ, its two-manual console there and the pipes overhead. (The location of the organ console and the choir have changed a third time, now being in the north transept.) Its future cathedral status, however, is somewhat in doubt as the Anglican Church of Canada considers rationalising its increasingly top-heavy episcopal structure and, with decreasing numbers of active church people it being over equipped with that, with parish churches steadily decreasing in number.|$|E
2500|$|The {{signal box}} dates from 1896, and was {{relocated}} from [...] East near Consett. It features assorted signalling equipment, basic furnishings for the signaller, and a lever frame, controlling the stations numerous points, interlocks and semaphore signals. The frame {{is not an}} operational part of the railway, the points being hand operated using track side levers. Visitors can only view the interior from a small area <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The view in {{the mirror}} shows two figures just <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> that the couple are facing. The second figure, wearing red, is presumably the artist although, unlike Velázquez in Las Meninas, he {{does not seem to}} be painting. Scholars have made this {{assumption}} based on the appearance of figures wearing red head-dresses in some other van Eyck works (e.g., the Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?) and the figure in the background of the Madonna with Chancellor Rolin). [...] The dog is an early form of the breed now known as the Brussels griffon.|$|E

2500|$|The facade is elaborately done in stucco {{and stone}} work, with ochre of the pilasters {{contrasting}} {{with the yellow}} {{of many of the}} decorative details. Much of the detail is vegetative, along with small angels and eagles. European elements include images of saints such as Saint Dominic and Francis of Assisi and the Franciscan coat of arms. <b>Inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> there are the images of Saints Peter and Paul. Native elements include a double-headed Mexican eagle devouring a serpent. On the upper left, there is an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe on the upper left, the Our Lady of the Pillar. These are the virgin images of Mexico and Spain respectively. [...] This statue {{is said to have been}} taken by a general at the end of the 19th century. It was replaced by a more modern clock. [...] Inside, the cupola of the Jalpan mission contains scenes of the appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of these}} {{teachers}} (Miss Allen of Illinois), whose school was at Cotton Gin Port in Monroe County, was visited ... {{between one and}} {{two o'clock in the}} morning on March 1871, by about fifty men mounted and disguised. Each man wore a long white robe and his face was covered by a loose mask with scarlet stripes. She was ordered to get up and dress which she did at once and then admitted to her room the captain and lieutenant who in addition to the usual disguise had long horns on their heads and a sort of device in front. The lieutenant had a pistol in his hand and he and the captain sat down while eight or ten men stood <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and the porch was full. They treated her [...] "gentlemanly and quietly" [...] but complained of the heavy school-tax, said she must stop teaching and go away and warned her that they never gave a second notice. She heeded the warning and left the county.|$|E
2500|$|There he had {{a temple}} built, {{and it was a}} {{sizeable}} building, with a door on the side-wall near the gable. The high-seat pillars were placed <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and nails, that were called holy nails , were driven into them. Beyond that point, the temple was a sanctuary. At the inner end there was a structure similar to the choir in churches nowadays and there was a raised platform {{in the middle of the}} floor like an altar, where a ring weighing twenty ounces and fashioned without a join was placed, and all oaths had to be sworn on this ring. It also had to be worn by the temple priest at all public gatherings. A sacrificial bowl [...] was placed on the platform and in it a sacrificial twig like a priest's aspergillumwhich was used to sprinkle blood from the bowl. This blood, which was called sacrificial blood , was the blood of live animals offered to the gods. The gods were placed around the platform in the choir-like structure within the temple. All farmers had to pay a toll to the temple [...] [...] [...] [...] The temple godi was responsible for the upkeep of the temple and ensuring it was maintained properly, as well as for holding sacrificial feasts in it.|$|E

2500|$|Zev Aelony {{and five}} others, {{including}} Claire O’Conner, Gene Uphoff, Dave Martin, Marv Davidoff, and Bob Baum, {{set off on}} a bus journey with New Orleans as the final destination. The {{first part of the}} ride was uneventful, and the group did not experience any violence. They stopped in Nashville to stay at the Freedom House with Diane Nash and Rodney Powell, and they joined in a picket of a grocery store there. The Freedom Riders continued on their journey and were arrested when they arrived in Jackson, Mississippi. Police Chief Captain Ray met them <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the black waiting room, and they were taken to the Jackson City Jail. After a couple of nights they were transferred to the Hines County Jail, and when that facility filled up they were moved to Mississippi’s notorious Parchman Farm. While there, Aelony participated in a hunger strike with several others, and he was isolated {{for a period of time}} for writing [...] "you’ll reap what you sow" [...] on the back wall with a spoon. In [...] retrospect, [...] the federal government seemed slow to respond to the request from civil rights workers to enforce the interstate commerce clause decision [...] by the supreme court, [...] both for political reasons, for caution, and until international pressures arose to demonstrate US [...] commitment to democracy, freedom of travel, and equality under the law. [...] Aelony's interview in May 1963 in German with a West German filmmaker played extensively on TV in Europe, contributing immediately to the political pressure from Europe.|$|E

50|$|The SIPS {{system works}} {{by having a}} {{reinforced}} lower sill, b-pillar and energy absorbing honeycomb materials <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> <b>The</b> idea is to more widely distribute the energy in a side collision across the whole {{side of the car}} rather than having the b-pillar absorb it all. Driver and passenger seat are mounted on transverse steel rails, not bolted to the floor as per the standard configuration. In a side impact these transverse rails allow the seats to crush a reinforced center console designed to absorb additional energy.|$|R
