The Vickers hardness, the Los Angeles coefficient (LA) {{and the loss of}} mass in each of the freeze–thaw cycles to which the samples were subjected were measured. Four cement mortars CEM I 52. 5 R were prepared, one as control, and the other three with the additions: 5 % nano-Si, 5 % nano-Al and mix 2. 5 % n-Si and 2. 5 % n-Al. Mortars were tested at 7, 28 and 90 d of curing to determine compression strength, total porosity and pore distribution by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and the relationship between the CSH gel and Portlandite total by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The capillary suction coefficient and an analysis by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) was made. There was a large increase in Vickers surface hardness for 5 % n-Si mortar and a slight increase in resistance to abrasion. No significant difference was found between the mortars with nano-particles, whose LA was about 10. 8, classifying them as materials with good resistance to abrasion. The microstructure shows that the addition of n-Si in mortars refines their porous matrix, increases the amount of hydrated gels and generates significant changes in both Portlandite and Ettringite. This produced a significant improvement in <b>freeze–thaw</b> cycle <b>resistance.</b> The effect of n-Al on mortar was null or negative with respect to <b>freeze–thaw</b> cycle <b>resistance...</b>|$|R

Increased temperatures as well as altered precipitation and snow cover patterns are predicted to change species distribution and affect biogeochemical processes in the subarctic tundra. Bryophytes are an essential vegetational component in northern ecosystems, due to their high abundance and importance in many ecological processes. In this study the effects of elevation and altered snow cover on the temporal dynamics of freezing damage in three subarctic bryophyte species (Hylocomium splendens, Ptilidium ciliare, and Sphagnum fuscum) were studied in a snow manipulation field experiment in Abisko, during early spring. Soil temperature and field moisture of moss shoots were collected. A freeze-thaw incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the <b>freeze-thaw</b> cycle <b>resistance</b> of H. splendens and P. ciliare originating from habitats with two differing snow-cover thicknesses. Freezing damage differed significantly between the bryophytes species with P. ciliare experiencing the least and S. fuscum the highest damage. Damage was higher at the low elevation, possibly attributable to acclimation effects. Snow removal led to higher damage in moss shoots, but no interactions of the different snow cover treatments with elevation, species or time were found. Freezing damage increased over time and no recovery occurred, likely due to temporal patterns in soil freeze-thaw cycles during early spring. Soil freeze-thaw cycles were the main factor influencing damage in bryophytes after snow melt. Measured environmental parameters could not explain the entire variation in damage.

40|$|AbstractThe {{manufacture}} of cements with several main constituents (blended cements) {{is of particular}} importance with regard to reducing climatically relevant CO 2 emissions in the cement industry. A wide variety of common cement products exists in the different EU Member States. They match local manufacturing conditions, throughout meeting particular climatic or other local conditions, including building practices. In general, all cements conforming to European Cement Standard EN 197 - 1 are suitable for the {{manufacture of}} concrete according to European Concrete Standard EN 206 - 1. Depending on the area of application, however, differences related to the cement type may possibly {{have to be taken}} into account to ensure the durability of the concretes manufactured with these cements. These regulations were laid down in National Application Documents (NADs) to EN 206 - 1 dependent upon the exposure classes that a structural element is assigned to. This paper deals with the overall concept of EN 206 - 1 with regard to concrete durability. It gives an overview of the cement types used in Europe and the areas of application of cements conforming to EN 197 - 1 in concrete conforming to EN 206 - 1 and various national annexes. The option of combining several main constituents makes blended cements particularly well suited for combining the advantages of individual main constituents, and thus for developing these cements into even more robust systems. This process requires an integrated assessment of all requirements to be met by cements during manufacture and application. From a technical perspective these include the strength formation potential as well as good workability of the concrete and, in particular, the durability of the concrete made from these cements. The effects that the main constituents have with regard to properties relevant to durability can be utilized in particular in cements made from a combination of limestone/blastfurnace slag or limestone/fly ash as main constituents.

40|$|A {{high-performance}} mortar (HPM) {{containing a}} large amount of industrial by-products such as fly ash, silica fume, and limestone fines was developed for rapid repair of concrete pavements. The HPM development included three major steps. 1. Development of the mortar mixture proportion based on the optimal hydration of binder and particle packing of the mortar system. In this step of the study, all mortar materials were systematically proportioned, and the obtained mixtures were tested for flowability, rate of hydration, set time, and strength development. The optimal mixture proportion was then selected as the HPM, as it displayed good self-consolidating ability and achieved 1 -day compressive strengths greater than 6, 000 psi. 2. Investigation of the mechanical properties of the new HPM, including compressive and flexural strength, elastic modulus, and slant shear and pull-off strengths of patch-substrate bonds tested at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days. In this step, the properties of the HPM were evaluated in comparison with those of a commercial repair material: the rapid-set concrete (RSC). Two types of substrates representing old concrete were used for patching repair. One was made of a typical pavement mixture (C- 3 WR-C 20), and the other was a high-strength pavement concrete mixture (O- 4 WR). 3. Investigation of the durability properties of the newly developed HPM compared to those of the RSC. Durability properties included cyclic <b>freeze-thaw</b> (F-T) <b>resistance,</b> permeability, and shrinkage behavior. The results indicated that the newly developed HPM possesses excellent self-consolidating ability: highly flowable and non-segregating. Although there was delayed setting, the compressive strength of the HPM exceeded 6, 000 psi at 1 day, approximately 25 percent higher than that of the RSC. At 28 days, the HPM reached 10, 000 psi, while the RSC was about 7, 000 psi. The HPM also displayed extremely low chloride permeability (18 coulombs) compared to the RSC (2, 550 coulombs) and excellent F-T durability without the requirement for air entrainment. The F-T durability factor of HPM was kept around 100 % throughout the standard F-T test, while the F-T durability factor of RSC reduced to 80 % {{at the end of the}} F-T test. However, the HPM exhibited noticeably higher autogenous shrinkage and slightly lower free drying shrinkage than the C- 3 WR-C 20 mixture, while the RSC had a little/no shrinkage during the 56 -day test period. Addition of a small amount of micro-steel fibers (70 pcy) slightly reduced the shrinkage of the HPM. Further studies on fatigue and shrinkage cracking behavior of the HPM are recommended. concrete...|$|R
40|$|Self-consolidating {{concrete}} (SCC) is a {{high performance}} concrete that flows under its own weight so that filling forms containing congested reinforcement is possible without mechanical vibration within placements. There has been growing interest to use SCC for precast and prestressed concrete elements. Therefore, {{it is important to}} examine the mechanical and durability properties of SCC to gain insights for the design and implementation of SCC in structures. This thesis presents the mechanical and durability experiments used for characterization and acceptance of SCC. Because there are many normally vibrated concretes (NVC) used today for structural applications, comparisons between the mechanical and durability properties of SCC and an NVC typically used in New Mexico bridges are performed to evaluate the performance of SCC. Two sources of local aggregate in New Mexico were used to produce SCC and NVC mixes. Mechanical properties include compressive and flexural strength, and static and dynamic modulus of elasticity. Durability properties include chloride ion <b>resistance,</b> <b>freeze-thaw</b> durability, and potential for alkali-silica reaction (ASR). Experimental investigations show that SCC can have similar strength characteristics compared to NVC. Lowering the water to total cementitious materials ratio causes SCC to gain significant strength properties without compromising the requirements for plastic properties. Furthermore, results show that chloride ion resistivity in SCC is adequate, and in many cases exceeded that of NVC. It is recommended that air void systems of SCC are examined in the future due to discrepancies in freeze thaw durability results of SCC. Finally, it was found that SCC does not have higher potential to ASR compared with NVC in the presence of reactive aggregate even when high dosages of chemical admixtures are provided.

40|$|Refractory {{concretes}} (RC) are industrial {{materials used}} most commonly in high temperature applications, {{primarily in the}} steel and glass industries. In most cases they are a mix of refractory aggregate’s chosen for specific hot engineering applications combined with a cement binder. RCs are known to ceramicists largely only for their insulating properties {{for which they are}} used in the manufacture of kilns as hot face lining. However, currently very little information is available regarding the structural and aesthetic possibilities that RC can offer to the artist and designer. It is the researcher’s view that refractory concrete displays novel handling properties that include: increased green and fired toughness and strength, thermal shock resistance, ceramic glaze compatibility, thixotropic effects and rapid setting. These properties offer the opportunity to achieve the creation of objects that do not conform to some of the traditional limitations of conventional clay. This research asks whether new products and visual qualities might be achieved by the adoption of these materials in a sphere different from their intended industrial application. The thesis demonstrates these properties through a series of practice based projects each designed to capatilise on the unique and novel capabilities of RC. The objective was to develop new and innovative products some of which have architectural or urban design applications. In response to the applications developed through the practice elements of the research, two quantiative studies were conducted. New data on RCs <b>resistance</b> to <b>freeze-thaw</b> and slip <b>resistance</b> was generated both confirming that RC is fit for purpose in the proposed applications. Throughout the research the RC industry has been an integral source of both materials and expertise. This collaborative relationship is seen as generating knowledge transfer opportunities between industry and academic research. The research acknowledges the limitations of a single researchers approach and tackles this deficiency by engaging other professional artists and designers in the form of four case studies. The results of the case studies are evaluated using structured interviews. The practice based elements of the research are combined with quantitive research conducted to demonstrate the viability of RC as both a material with creative potential in the ceramic studio, and in the architectural and design sphere.

40|$|Solar road {{panels are}} a {{technology}} that {{have the ability to}} revolutionize the way that roads are built and how electricity is generated. Strong incentives towards sustainable solutions in both of these fields have led to the design of innovative, multifaceted solutions, of which solar road panels {{are one of the most}} recent entrants. This research presents some initial analysis into the design of solar road panels from the perspective of Canadian pavement engineering. The hypothesis of this research was as follows: A specially designed modular panel can be constructed to withstand the structural and environmental loads on Canadian pavement structures while simultaneously generating electricity through embedded photovoltaic cells. Through a process that covers the design, construction, and analysis of the structural elements of a solar road panel prototype, this research evaluated the impact that solar road panels can have for Canada’s pavement infrastructure. Specific elements researched include the material selection for such a panel, the flexural response of the composite structure, how the panel will interact with traditional pavement and geotechnical materials while in use, and the change in performance of transparent layer materials as they are subjected to freeze-thaw cycling and scaling. The research found that the initial prototype design included a two 10 -mm tempered glass pane transparent layers with a 12. 7 -mm GPO- 3 optical layer and 19. 1 -mm GPO- 3 base layer. The concept being that the glass would provide the rigidity required to protect the fragile solar cells while the fiberglass laminate has demonstrated performance as a traffic-supporting material in adverse conditions. Testing of this structure found that the performance was easily duplicated through finite element analysis, given that the material properties were assumed to be more rigid than the averages for tempered glass and GPO- 3. Further finite element analysis demonstrated that the prototype solar road panel would not fail through traditional fatiguing methods, and in all cases on concrete, asphalt, granular, and subgrade bases the panels improved the performance characteristics of the structural base. The environmental conditioning of acrylic, glass, and polycarbonate specimens demonstrated that glass is the ideal material choice for the transparent layer for Canadian solar road panels. It proved to have the greatest <b>freeze-thaw</b> and scaling <b>resistance</b> of the three materials, and while the friction characteristic of the flat glass samples would not be suitable for driving on, avenues of research were identified that could improve this characteristic. In summary, the research conducted clearly proved the hypothesis; it is possible to build a structure that can house a photovoltaic system while supporting the structural and environmental loads that Canadian pavement are exposed to. The ideal panel would be constructed with a tempered glass transparent layer, GPO- 3 optical and base layers, and the structure would be installed on a concrete structural base. The refinement of this design will be the scope for future research...|$|R
40|$|The Wisconsin Department of Transportation WISDOT) has {{sponsored}} investigations on {{the causes of}} freeze-thaw scaling damage on Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) roadways within the state that are coated with membrane forming curing compounds (MFCCs). Several studies have identified excess bleed water {{at the time of}} curing compound application as a potential cause of reduced scaling resistance of concrete pavements. Increasing the delay between concrete finishing steps and MFC application should serve to lessen scaling damage. However, there is currently no literature that sought to quantify a possible linkage between MFCC application time and the scaling resistance. The primary goal of this research was to evaluate the influence of MFCC application time on the <b>freeze-thaw</b> scaling damage <b>resistance</b> of roadway concrete made with materials native to Wisconsin. A factorial experiment was designed to probe the effect of MFCC application time on scaling damage as measured by ASTM C 672. Three emulsion-based curing compounds, Linseed Oil, Wax, and Poly-alpha-methyl-styrene (PAMS) were evaluated at three application times on concrete specimens prepared with one of two sources of coarse aggregate and one of three cementitious materials. An Acrylic solvent-based sealing compound was evaluated at two application times with respect to concrete scaling resistance. Untreated specimens from each mix type were cured in a wet room and tested as controls. A secondary goal of this project was to evaluate a new method for determining the presence of bleed water on a concrete surface by constructing a device to detect changes in the relative humidity of the air above the concrete surface over time to more reliably determine the cessation of the bleeding than current methods. To achieve this goal, a device was built and its operational capability was tested during the study. ii Concrete mixes were designed and specimens were prepared according to WISDOT procedures to provide a good representation of the pavements within Wisconsin. Freeze-thaw scaling damage testing was performed on all specimens and data was recorded following the appropriate testing standard. Properties such as fresh concrete slump, air content, 28 -day compressive strength, and curing compound application rates were measured and recorded to ensure compliance with WISDOT standards. Results in this study indicate that the influence of MFCC application time on the scaling resistance of concrete is dependent upon the compound chosen. The Linseed Oil and Acrylic formulations displayed significantly increased scaling resistance with an increase in application time. The Wax and PAMS formulations did not display significant increases in scaling resistance with an increase in application time. Results from the untreated wet room cured specimens indicate that curing compounds do not promote scaling resistance levels that compare favorably to the humidity control method wet room curing. Scaling resistance was also found to be dependent upon composition of the concrete, especially with respect to the coarse aggregate and cementitious material choice. Elevated levels of ambient relative humidity at the time of specimen manufacture appeared to decrease the scaling resistance, regardless of application time. The device was found not to be reliable for monitoring the presence of bleed water in its current design. Analysis of the data collected by the device showed that future modifications could be made improve its operational capability...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} porous vegetation concrete formed using the industrial by-products blast furnace slag powder and blast furnace slag aggregates. We investigated the void ratio, compressive strength, <b>freeze–thaw</b> <b>resistance,</b> plant growth and water purification properties using concretes containing these by-products, natural jute fiber and latex. The target performance was a compressive strength of ≥ 12 MPa, a void ratio of ≥ 25 % and a residual compressive strength of ≥ 80 % following 100 freeze–thaw cycles. Using these target performance metrics and test results for plant growth and water purification, an optimal mixing ratio was identified. The study characterized the physical and mechanical properties of the optimal mix, and found that the compressive strength decreased compared with the default mix, but that the void ratio and the <b>freeze–thaw</b> <b>resistance</b> increased. When latex was used, the compressive strength, void ratio and <b>freeze–thaw</b> <b>resistance</b> all improved, satisfying the target performance metrics. Vegetation growth tests showed that plant growth was more active when the blast furnace slag aggregate was used. Furthermore, the use of latex was also found to promote vegetation growth, which is attributed to the latex forming a film coating that suppresses leaching of toxic components from the cement. Water purification tests showed no so significant differences between different mixing ratios; however, a comparison of mixes with and without vegetation indicated improved water purification in terms of the total phosphorus content when vegetation had been allowed to grow...|$|E
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{experimental study}} has been conducted to investigate the effect of fly ash on the durability of the concrete composites. Four different fly ash contents (10, 15, 20 and 25 % respectively) were used. The durability of concrete composites includes water impermeability, dry shrinkage property, the carbonation resistance and the <b>freeze-thaw</b> <b>resistance.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} addition of fly ash has greatly improved the water impermeability and restricted the dry shrinkage of concrete composites. With the increase of fly ash content, the length of water permeability and the dry shrinkage strain of the specimens have a tendency of decrease with the increase of fly ash content. However, the addition of fly ash has a little adverse effect on the carbonation resistance and <b>freeze-thaw</b> <b>resistance</b> of concrete composites. With the increase of fly ash content, the carbonation depth is increasing and the relative dynamic elastic modulus of the freeze-thaw specimen is decreasing gradually...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyCivil EngineeringKyle RidingPre-stressed {{concrete}} is {{used for}} manufacturing railroad ties. Air entrainment is used in concrete railroad ties to provide durability in freeze-thaw conditions commonly present in track. Vibration practices in pre-stressed concrete railroad tie plants could contribute to excessive air loss during manufacture and thus poor <b>freeze-thaw</b> <b>resistance.</b> Rheological properties of fresh concrete significantly influence the determination of how much air is lost during vibration. This research attempted to increase understanding {{of the effect of}} vibration on air bubble distribution and <b>freeze-thaw</b> <b>resistance</b> of concrete given certain compositions and rheological properties of concrete. The objective was achieved by examining the effect of different admixtures combinations, vibration parameters, and rheological properties on the air void system and <b>freeze-thaw</b> <b>resistance</b> of concrete. This research also proposed a method to measure rheological properties of concrete when vibrated and for concrete mixtures too stiff to measure using conventional rheology measurements. Results showed that delaying the initiation of vibration can cause significant air loss but does not necessarily decrease freeze-thaw performance of concrete. Results also showed that a majority of air loss occurs in the first 30 seconds of vibration. The types of admixtures used in the concrete mixture can significantly affect the air system and freeze-thaw durability of concrete; this effect was shown to be more pronounced in mixtures with low yield stress and plastic viscosity. While the peak vibration acceleration had a mild effect, the frequency and peak velocity of vibration did not seem to have a noticeable effect on the air system and freeze-thaw performance of concrete. Results also showed that rheological properties of stiff mixtures can be estimated by running the rheology test during vibration...|$|E
40|$|Freeze-thaw {{cycle is}} one of the major damage factors of {{concrete}} patch repair. Not only the material itself but also the adhesive interface is damaged under freeze-thaw cycles (FTC). Air-entraining agent has long been used to increase the <b>freeze-thaw</b> <b>resistance</b> of concrete materials. However, the effect of air-entraining agent on the adhesive interface has not been explored. The degradation mechanism and failure mode of concrete repair system under FTC has not been studied, either. In this study, three kinds of substrate concrete were casted and repaired by two kinds of ordinary Portland cement mortars and one kind of polymer-modified cement mortar (PCM), respectively. With up to 150 FTC, splitting tensile strength and failure modes of composite specimens were experimented. Results showed that air-entraining agent in the repairing mortar greatly influenced adhesive tensile strength under FTC. The water cement ratio and air-entraining agent of substrate concrete insignificantly affected the adhesive interface, but affects failure mode. The adhesive tensile strength of PCM-repaired composite specimens decreased faster than that of ordinary Portland cement mortar-repaired composite specimens although PCM itself showed stronger <b>freeze-thaw</b> <b>resistance</b> than ordinary mortar...|$|E
40|$|This bachelor’s thesis {{deals with}} {{durability}} of alkali-activated {{materials and the}} use of them in aggressive surroundings, especially in sewer systems. The first half of the theoretical part summarizes requirements for concrete sewer pipes. The most common linings and coatings used in concrete sewer systems are mentioned. The second half of the theoretical part deals with alkali-activated materials, raw materials used for their preparation and their durability. Concretely sulfate attack resistance, chloride attack resistance, acid attack resistance, abrasion, porosity, <b>freeze-thaw</b> <b>resistance,</b> thin layer applications and cracking tendency. In the experimental part of this bachelor’s thesis there were proposed five types of alkali-activated materials application in the aggressive environment of sewer systems. Density and consumption of alkali-activated material by thin layer application was determined as fresh properties. Material was monitored during its solidifying and hardening, especially for crack formation. As hardened properties density, flexural strength, compressive strength, adhesion of thin layer to concrete, thickness of thin layer, <b>freeze-thaw</b> <b>resistance,</b> resistance of surface to water and defrosting chemicals were determined...|$|E
40|$|Concrete {{exposed to}} cyclic {{freezing}} and thawing may deteriorate by surface scaling, internally developed cracks or both in combination. The rate of deterioration {{tends to be}} accelerated in concretes containing higher levels of supplementary cementitious materials including slag and limestone. A fundamental insight into the relationship between cement composition and <b>freeze–thaw</b> <b>resistance</b> is therefore imperative for developing durable composite cement concretes. Concrete samples prepared from CEM I, binary slag cements and ternary limestone slag cement blends at 0 · 5 w/b ratio without air entrainment were investigated. The freeze–thaw test {{was based on the}} CIF method according to PD CEN/TR 15177. Additionally, phase assemblages in the concretes before and after freeze–thaw damage were evaluated. Before freeze–thaw testing, compressive strengths were similar but the composite cements were slightly more susceptible to carbonation. However, the scaling and internal damage resistance decreased in the order of CEM I, binary and limestone ternary blended cements. The composition of the scaled material differed from the bulk, revealing an absence of portlandite and a marked reduction in AFm and ettringite contents. A probable explanation for the reduced <b>freeze–thaw</b> <b>resistance</b> includes the porosity differences and the lower portlandite content compared to CEM I concrete...|$|E
40|$|Graphene oxide (GO) is a newly invented {{material}} with extraordinary properties. This paper presents {{the effect of}} graphene oxide addition on <b>freeze-thaw</b> <b>resistance</b> in hardened cement. GO is incorporated in the cementitious matrix in ratios of 0. 01, 0. 03, and 0. 06 % by weight of cement. Freeze-thaw cycle tests show a weight loss of approximately 0. 8 % after 540 cycles in the control mix compared to approximately 0. 25 % in 0. 06 % GO mix. Several tests were conducted to investigate the reasons behind this result. The tests included nitrogen and water adsorption, air content, and compressive strength. The results showed that GO mixes have finer pore structure than the control mix. Moreover, {{the results indicated that}} GO addition increases air content in the mix and shows high compressive strength compared to the control mix. The enhancement of <b>freeze-thaw</b> <b>resistance</b> due to GO addition can be because of the modification of pore structure where water hardly freezes in small pores. Also, the resistance of nanocracks propagations can limit the development of frost damages, in addition to the entraining air in the mix by GO addition that creates room to release osmotic pressure...|$|E
