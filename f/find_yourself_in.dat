25|$|The “worlds” in {{the many}} worlds theory is then just the {{complete}} measurement history up until and during the measurement in question, where splitting happens. These “worlds” each describe a different state of the universal wave function and cannot communicate. There is no collapse of the wavefunction into one state or another, but rather you just <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> the world leading up to what measurement you have made and are unaware of the other possibilities that are equally real.|$|E
500|$|Farmer {{recorded}} {{only twice}} with Horace Silver's group, as Silver recorded for Blue Note Records, while Farmer was signed to Prestige. Feuds between the label bosses ruled out extensive cross-label collaboration. The transition from Silver's piano-led quintet to Mulligan's piano-less quartet was not straightforward: [...] "to suddenly <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> a pianoless group was like {{walking down the}} street naked", commented Farmer. As a member of Mulligan's band, Farmer appeared on film twice – in I Want to Live! (1958) and The Subterraneans (1960) – and again toured Europe, as part of a Jazz at the Philharmonic tour, helping him to develop an international reputation. In New York, Farmer worked with Lester Young, who told him to [...] "tighten up and tell a 'story' in each solo". At this time, Farmer also rented his trumpet on a nightly basis to Miles Davis, who had pawned his own due to his drug dependency.|$|E
2500|$|Gardner depicts Mason as {{a lawyer}} who fights hard {{on behalf of his}} clients and who enjoys unusual, {{difficult}} or nearly-hopeless cases. [...] He frequently accepts clients on a whim based on his curiosity about their problem, for a minimal retainer, and finances the investigation of their cases himself if necessary. In The Case of the Caretaker's Cat (1935), his principal antagonist, District Attorney Hamilton Burger, says: [...] "You're a better detective than you are a lawyer. [...] When you turn your mind to the solution of a crime, you ferret out the truth." [...] And in The Case of the Moth-Eaten Mink (1952), a judge who has just witnessed one of the lawyer's unusual tactics says: [...] "Mr. Mason...from time to time you seem to <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> predicaments from which you extricate yourself by unusual methods which invariably turn out to be legally sound. [...] The Court feels you are fully capable of looking after your own as well as your clients' interests." ...|$|E

2500|$|Blink-182 reunited in February 2009 and Hoppus {{confirmed}} {{in an interview}} with Alternative Press that +44 was on hiatus: [...] "I don't consider it done. We'll never say never with anything," [...] he remarked. [...] "As soon as you say, 'I'm not gonna do that anymore,' you <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> a situation where you wanna do that. Shane [...] and Craig [...] are awesome guitarists and great fun to play in a band with, so we definitely won't say that the band is done. But obviously, for the foreseeable future, all of our energy is going into Blink-182." [...] In an interview with Blunt Magazine in March 2009, Hoppus was asked if +44 will continue again, where he stated [...] "I think so, yes. I love Shane [...] and Craig [...] They are great guitarists and good friends and I'd love to do another record with them. I know that Tom DeLonge plans to continue doing Angels & Airwaves in some capacity but right now all of our efforts are on Blink." ...|$|E
