5|$|Most of the Daddies' studio albums {{are written}} to varying <b>extents</b> as concept albums, {{featuring}} either recurring lyrical themes or an abstract progressive narrative. According to Perry, this lyrical interconnectedness is intended as means of providing an album with threads of thematic stability against wildly varying musical styles.|$|E
5|$|Different {{societies}} and cultures have used family symbols in advertising to varying <b>extents</b> of success. Because family life stresses in-group benefits, preferences, and successes over {{those of the}} individual, collectivist societies tend to use more family symbols in advertising than individualist societies. For example, Korea, which is reputably collectivistic, has more success with family advertisements than the United States, which is reputably individualistic.|$|E

5|$|Although NY99 {{was signed}} as a state highway, {{maintenance}} on the route was performed by Franklin County, which designated the roadway as CR26. All of NY99 was initially a gravel road; however, most of the road was paved in the early 1970s {{through the use of}} state funds procured by New York State Senator Ronald Stafford of Plattsburgh. The western and eastern <b>extents</b> of the road were paved soon afterward; however, the road was left unpaved in the vicinity of Loon Lake—a lake near the midpoint of the route—even though the necessary gravel base was applied to the entire highway. The unpaved section deteriorated as a result, and the NY99 designation was removed from the roadway on September26, 1994.|$|E
5|$|East of Lewiston village, NY104 follows Ridge Road {{through a}} sparsely {{populated}} area of Niagara County. Much of this portion of NY104 is bordered on its southern end by the Tuscarora Indian Reservation. At the Lewiston hamlet of Dickersonville, the <b>extents</b> of the reservation head south, and development along NY104 increases slightly. NY104 meets the northern terminus of NY429 at the Lewiston–Cambria town line and crosses over NY425 at Streeters Corners. Just east of this location is an intersection with NY93 {{in the community of}} Molyneaux Corners. The two routes form a concurrency east to Warrens Corners, a hamlet on the Cambria–Lockport town line, where NY93 turns south to serve the city of Lockport.|$|E
5|$|In Mechanicville, US4 and NY32 briefly overlap NY67. Farther north, the two routes split {{north of}} Stillwater at the {{southern}} edge of the Saratoga National Historical Park. While US4 straddles the park to the east, NY32 follows the southern and western <b>extents</b> of the park before rejoining US4 south of Schuylerville. In Schuylerville, the two routes are concurrent with NY29 for a short distance before exiting the village. To the north of the village in Northumberland, NY32 separates from US4 and heads northwest to Gansevoort, where it meets NY50. NY32 continues north on the right-of-way of NY50 to South Glens Falls, where US9 joins NY32 northward across the Hudson River into Glens Falls.|$|E

5|$|In Preston, {{the open}} fields return as NY220 follows another waterbody, {{this time the}} {{slightly}} larger Mill Brook. The route crosses the stream just before entering the town of Oxford, where they split. While Mill Brook curves around the western <b>extents</b> of the village of Oxford, NY220 serves the village directly, entering it on Butler Street. It veers eastward at a junction with State Street and follows it to Washington Avenue. Here, State Street splits into a one-block long one-way couplet. Eastbound NY220 shifts south to follow LaFayette Park; NY220 westbound, meanwhile, is routed on State Street. At {{the end of the}} couplet, NY220 intersects NY12 (North Canal Street) on the western bank of the Chenango River.|$|E
5|$|NY10 begins {{concurrent}} with NY8 at an interchange {{with the}} Quickway (NY17) {{southeast of the}} village of Deposit near the Broome-Delaware County line. The two routes continue north along the eastern <b>extents</b> of Deposit to {{the banks of the}} west branch of the Delaware River, where NY8 breaks from NY10 to cross over the river. NY10, however, continues northeast along the riverbank, passing south of the Cannonsville Dam and the resulting Cannonsville Reservoir behind it. Near the midpoint of the water body, NY10 crosses over the reservoir on the Cannonsville Bridge and proceeds to follow the northern edge of the reservoir. As the reservoir begins to narrow, NY10 intersects NY268, a connector route leading south to the village of Hancock.|$|E
5|$|North of {{downtown}} Buffalo, I-190 follows {{the eastern edge}} of the Black Rock Canal (and passes the site of the former Black Rock toll barrier) before rejoining the banks of the Niagara near an exit with the Scajaquada Expressway (NY198, exit11). I-190 continues north through the northern <b>extents</b> of Buffalo, meeting multiple streets before separating from the Niagara and interchanging with NY266 and NY324 (exits15 and16) in quick succession. At exit16, NY324 joins I-190 northward through western Tonawanda. The two routes then meet I-290 and NY266 a second time prior to crossing the Niagara River on the South Grand Island Bridge. NY324 leaves the expressway shortly after arriving on Grand Island at exit18.|$|E

5|$|Several other West Coast and {{interior}} drainage basins border on {{that of the}} Klamath River. On the northwest are the Rogue River and Umpqua River in Oregon and the Smith River in California. On the east there is the closed Harney Basin and {{a small portion of}} the Great Basin. The south side of the Klamath River watershed is bounded by the Sacramento River and its upper tributaries, including the Pit River, and on the southwest side are the Mad River and Redwood Creek. The western boundary of the upper Klamath Basin is formed by the High Cascades and the Klamath Mountains, one of the southernmost <b>extents</b> of the Cascade Range, and the California Coast Ranges cover the southwestern watershed. The Klamath is one of only three rivers that begins east of the Cascades and flows into the Pacific Ocean; the other two are the Columbia and the Fraser.|$|E
5|$|Smaller realignments {{also took}} place in other cities along the route. In Canandaigua, NY5 {{originally}} entered the city on West Avenue and followed South Main Street and Lakeshore Drive through the city limits before rejoining its current routing in Hopewell. In the mid-1950s, a new bypass was built north of Lakeshore Drive from South Main Street to Hopewell. It became part of a realigned NY5 by 1956. The remainder of the bypass around the southwestern <b>extents</b> {{of the city was}} built in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The former routing of NY5 on South Main Street remains state maintained as NY942T; until 1996, the portion of West Avenue between the west end of the bypass and the Canandaigua city line was maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as NY942W. Even though maintenance of the road had been transferred to the town of Canandaigua in 1996, the designation remained in NYSDOT documents until 2007.|$|E
5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying <b>extents</b> at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E
