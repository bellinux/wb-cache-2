25|$|These {{are used}} for {{high-temperature}} <b>Fischer–Tropsch</b> <b>synthesis</b> (nearly 340nbsp&°C) to produce low-molecular-weight unsaturated hydrocarbons on alkalized fused iron catalysts. The fluid-bed technology (as adapted from the catalytic cracking of heavy petroleum distillates) was introduced by Hydrocarbon Research in 1946–50 and named the ‘Hydrocol’ process. A large scale Fischer–Tropsch Hydrocol plant (350,000 tons per annum) operated during 1951–57 in Brownsville, Texas. Due to technical problems, and lacking economy due to increasing petroleum availability, this development was discontinued. Fluid-bed <b>Fischer–Tropsch</b> <b>synthesis</b> has recently been very successfully reinvestigated by Sasol. One reactor with a capacity of 500,000 tons per annum is now in operation and even larger ones are being built (nearly 850,000 tons per annum). The process is now used mainly for C2 and C7 alkene production. This new development {{can be regarded as}} an important progress in Fischer–Tropsch technology. A high-temperature process with a circulating iron catalyst (‘circulating fluid bed’, ‘riser reactor’, ‘entrained catalyst process’) was introduced by the Kellogg Company and a respective plant built at Sasol in 1956. It was improved by Sasol for successful operation. At Secunda, South Africa, Sasol operated 16 advanced reactors of this type with a capacity of approximately 330,000 tons per annum each. Now the circulating catalyst process is being replaced by the superior Sasol-advanced fluid-bed technology. Early experiments with cobalt catalyst particles suspended in oil have been performed by Fischer. The bubble column reactor with a powdered iron slurry catalyst and a CO-rich syngas was particularly developed to pilot plant scale by Kölbel at the Rheinpreuben Company in 1953. Recently (since 1990) low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch slurry processes are under investigation for the use of iron and cobalt catalysts, particularly for the production of a hydrocarbon wax, or to be hydrocracked and isomerised to produce diesel fuel, by Exxon and Sasol. Today slurry-phase (bubble column) low-temperature <b>Fischer–Tropsch</b> <b>synthesis</b> is regarded by many authors as the most efficient process for Fischer–Tropsch clean diesel production. This Fischer–Tropsch technology is also under development by the Statoil Company (Norway) for use on a vessel to convert associated gas at offshore oil fields into a hydrocarbon liquid.|$|E
25|$|While often {{delegated}} {{to the field}} of astrobiology, attempts to understand how and when life arose are relevant to geobiology as well. The first major strides towards understanding the “how” came with the Miller-Urey experiment, when amino acids formed out of a simulated “primordial soup”. Another theory is that life originated in a system much like the hydrothermal vents at mid-oceanic spreading centers. In the <b>Fischer-Tropsch</b> <b>synthesis,</b> a variety of hydrocarbons form under vent-like conditions. Other ideas include the “RNA World” hypothesis, which postulates that the first biologic molecule was RNA and the idea that life originated elsewhere in the solar system and was brought to Earth, perhaps via a meteorite.|$|E
25|$|Cobalt-based {{catalysts}} {{are highly}} active, although iron {{may be more}} suitable for certain applications. Cobalt catalysts are more active for <b>Fischer–Tropsch</b> <b>synthesis</b> when the feedstock is natural gas. Natural gas has a high hydrogen to carbon ratio, so the water-gas-shift is not needed for cobalt catalysts. Iron catalysts are preferred for lower quality feedstocks such as coal or biomass. Synthesis gases derived from these hydrogen-poor feedstocks has a low-hydrogen-content and require the water–gas shift reaction. Unlike the other metals used for this process (Co, Ni, Ru), which remain in the metallic state during synthesis, iron catalysts tend to form a number of phases, including various oxides and carbides during the reaction. Control of these phase transformations can be important in maintaining catalytic activity and preventing breakdown of the catalyst particles.|$|E

30|$|The large {{consumption}} {{of fossil fuels}} (coal, gas, and oil) within the past decade by rapid industrial growth has brought several environmental problems such as the rising of global warming gases concentration, including CO 2, in air. Recently, the concentration of CO 2 has increased by about 1.5  ppm per year which means if there exists about 5.3  ×  1021 grams air in the atmosphere, the CO 2 increasing rate is about 8 billion tons per year [1, 2, 3]. Therefore, reducing the greenhouse gas emission is becoming very important. Carbon dioxide and methane are both greenhouse gases and are available in large amounts which make them interesting reactants {{for the production of}} synthesis gas. To reduce the emission of the greenhouse gases into the environment, many efforts have been reported by chemical and biological approach [4]. To date, the catalytic dry reforming of methane (DRM) with carbon dioxide to produce synthesis gas (syngas) has been proposed {{as one of the most}} promising technologies to reduce and utilize the CO 2 and also to produce syngas H 2 /CO ratio close to unity which is suitable for methanol, oxo-synthesis and other <b>Fischer–Tropsch</b> <b>syntheses</b> [5, 6, 7, 8].|$|R

Regardless of the operating conditions, FT synthesis always produces a wide range of light gases and distillates, including olefins, paraffins, and oxygenated products. Cobalt-based catalysts are preferentially applied in FTS processes aimed at producing precursors of the synthetic diesel owing to their high selectivity towards long-chain normal paraffins, their remarkable stability, and their lower activity for the competing water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) as compared to alternative catalysts based on iron [1, 2, 3].|$|R

50|$|Species {{that are}} typical ligands for a metal cluster {{represent}} obvious reactant-catalyst combinations. For example, hydrogenation of CO (<b>Fischer-Tropsch</b> <b>synthesis)</b> can be catalyzed using several metal clusters, {{as shown in}} the table above. It has been proposed that coordination of CO to multiple metal sites weakens the triple-bond enough to allow hydrogenation. As in the industrially significant heterogeneous process, <b>Fischer-Tropsch</b> <b>synthesis</b> by clusters yields alkanes, alkenes, and various oxygenates. The selectivity is heavily influenced by the particular cluster used. For example, Ir4(CO)12 produces methanol, whereas Ru2Rh(CO)12 produces ethylene glycol. Selectivity is determined by several factors, including steric and electronic effects. Steric effects are the most important consideration in many cases, however electronic effects dominate in hydrogenation reactions where one adsorbate (hydrogen) is relatively small.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Fischer-Tropsch</b> (FT) <b>synthesis</b> {{reaction}} is an increasingly valuable tool that produces very clean alternative fuels for the transportation and other industries. By utilizing a ready supply of syngas (H 2 and CO mixture) from coal, natural gas, or a biomass source, the catalyzed reaction {{looks to be}} a promising alternative which could potentially end dependency on imported petroleum. The supercritical phase FT synthesis reaction has shown, in numerous other studies, to possess superior heat transfer capabilities, high desorption rates from the catalyst surface (enhancing catalyst life), and overall high mass transfer rates of hydrocarbon products, when compared with conventional gas and liquid phase results. Prior studies at SIUC have shown that the use of supercritical CO 2 as a medium for the <b>Fischer-Tropsch</b> (FT) <b>synthesis</b> reaction enhances reaction rates while suppressing excess CO 2 production. This phenomena was observed in gas phase batch reactions, meaning never before has a continuous flow FT synthesis with analysis of the liquid product distribution been attempted while using CO 2 as the supercritical-phase medium. This project verifies the conclusions in a continuous flow mode, allowing for the collection and analysis of a liquid fraction. Additionally, this study evaluates the changes in the liquid product distribution for a variation of operating pressures including supercritical-phase reaction conditions, using pressures of 350, 800, 1000, and 1200 psi and temperatures of 250, 300, and 350 °C. The findings show that the influence of carbon dioxide enhance product distribution to yield a higher diesel fraction (C 13 to C 15), when compared to results without carbon dioxide as a medium, which favor gasoline fraction (C 7 to C 9). The findings also illustrate that operating in the supercritical region enhances product distribution, but depending on the solvent density, could potentially produce large amounts of oxygenates (alcohols, ketones) in the product distribution...|$|R
