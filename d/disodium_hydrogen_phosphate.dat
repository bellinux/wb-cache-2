The sodium nitrate {{is a highly}} water soluble white solid, used in high blood pressure, dentinal hypersensitivity, and production of fertilizers. The present study was aimed to investigate the impact of biofield treatment on spectral properties of <b>disodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> orthophosphate and sodium nitrate. The study was performed in two groups i. e., control and treatment of each compound. The treatment groups were subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment.

FT-IR spectrum of biofield treated <b>disodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> orthophosphate showed the shifting in wavenumber of vibrational peaks (with respect to control) corresponding to O-H stretching from 2975 to 3357 cm- 1, PO-H symmetrical stretching from 2359 to 2350 cm- 1, O=P-OH deformation from 1717 - 1796 cm- 1 to 1701 - 1735 cm- 1, P=O asymmetric stretching from 1356 to 1260 cm- 1 and P=O symmetric stretching from 1159 to 1132 cm- 1, etc. Likewise, the FT-IR spectrum of sodium nitrate exhibited the shifting of vibrational frequency of N=O stretching from 1788 to 1648 cm- 1 and NO 3 asymmetric and symmetric stretchings from 1369 to 1381 cm- 1 and 1340 to 1267 cm- 1.
