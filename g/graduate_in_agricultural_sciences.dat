25|$|There {{has been}} a steady {{increase}} <b>in</b> female <b>graduates</b> <b>in</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>sciences</b> {{since the turn of}} the century. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, numbers of female <b>graduates</b> <b>in</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>science</b> have been increasing steadily, with eight countries reporting a share of women graduates of 40% or more: Lesotho, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. The reasons for this surge are unclear, although one explanation may lie in the growing emphasis on national food security and the food industry. Another possible explanation is that women are highly represented in biotechnology. For example, in South Africa, women were underrepresented in engineering (16%) in 2004 and in ‘natural scientific professions’ (16%) in 2006 but made up 52% of employees working in biotechnology-related companies.|$|R
