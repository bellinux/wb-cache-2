30|$|The optimal cross-layer {{cognitive}} MAC protocol (OCC-MAC) [29] is an opportunistic spectrum access (OSA)-type MAC {{protocol for}} multi-hop CRAHNs.

OCC-MAC tries to balance the interference level and the contention level among cognitive links to utilize spectrum opportunities in a unified optimization framework. Despite its optimality, the overhead congestion and unsuccessful reception of control messages on the CCC may be a key bottleneck to the deployment of OCC-MAC in practice.|$|E

The impact of the starch-to-gluten ratio on microstructure and water distribution in pasta was analyzed by a multi-scale approach combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and light microscopy. The cooking process and thus the water distribution was monitored non-invasively using 1 H MRI in real-time with a temporal resolution of 45 s.

40|$|Recent {{research}} on intrusion detection systems (IDSes) has mainly focused on improving the traffic analyzing rate {{to meet the}} increasing bandwidth requirements [4], [5]. This has prompted the rise of hybrid usage of CPUs and GPUs well as FPGA/ASIC-based IDS systems that scale well to tens of Gbps of the <b>ingress</b> traffic <b>rate</b> [2], [3], [6]. One noticeable concern with these systems, however, is that they typically become a power hog that consumes several hundreds (up to a thousand) of watts of processing power. In recent years, low-powered programmable many-core processors (MCPs) have actively reduced the power usage despite with tens of processors. Although IDSes running on MCP hardware show promising results, they fail to scale at <b>ingress</b> <b>rates</b> of 10 + Gbps due to (i) high memory access contention and (ii) increased branched instruction prediction misses. In this work, we seek the right balance between power efficiency and high performance on signature-based IDS on a Tilera board [1]. In normal situations, our system analyzes entire ingress traffic in a power-efficient way, solely using the co-processor. However, when the system is under stress (opportunistic offloading mode), the IDS starts delegating subtasks to the host system. We have devised the offloading mode in two flavors. (i) In a flow-centric offloading mode, only the packets from new connections bypass the MCP and are directly forwarded to the host system for comprehensive analysis. (ii) In a functional offloading mode, the entire ingress traffic is first processed by the MCP; and only suspect flows (that pass {{the first stage of}} multi-attack string pattern matching phase) are subsequently offloaded to the host system for further analysis. We compare the effectiveness of these approaches and aim to achieve a multi- 10 Gbps analyzing rate while consuming only a few tens to hundreds of watts.

In this paper, we describe a distributed algorithm, based on a probabilistic graphical model and Bayesian active learning, for simultaneously estimating the probabilistic available bandwidth of multiple paths through a network. Our procedure exploits the fact that each packet train provides information not only about the path it traverses, but also about any path that shares a link with the monitored path.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} long-term characterisation and probabilistic modelling of chloride ingress into reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Since the corrosion initiation stage may cover various decades, normal tests which simulate chloride penetration into concrete in laboratory conditions as the same as natural conditions, will require significant experimental times. Hence, long-term lifetime assessment of RC structures under chloride attack remains still a challenge. In practice this problem is solved {{through the use of}} accelerated tests which speed up the chloride <b>ingress</b> <b>rate</b> and provide valuable mid-and long-term information on the chloride penetration process. Nevertheless, this information cannot be directly used for parameter statistical characterisation if the equivalent times required in natural conditions to reach the same chloride concentrations in the accelerated tests are unknown. Consequently, this study proposes a novel iterative approach based on Bayesian network updating to estimate chloride ingress model parameters from the data obtained under accelerated laboratory conditions. The Bayesian Network structure and iterative approach are first tested with numerical evidences. Thereafter, the complete proposed methodology is verified with results from real experimental measurements. The results indicate that combining data from normal and accelerated tests significantly reduces the statistical characterisation error of model parameters...|$|E
40|$|Data on {{chloride}} penetration into concrete {{exposed to}} a simulated aggressive marine environment are presented. Concrete specimens, large beams and small cubes, are subjected to 90 complete exposure cycles of wetting and drying plus heating and cooling. The applied exposure condition consists of a drying period of 42 hrs followed by a wetting phase of 6 hrs with salt water containing 5 % NaCl. The drying phase itself is a thermal regime characterised by a temperature swing from 20 °C to 60 °C within a period of 12 hrs. This simulates, with some accelerations, the aggressive marine environmental condition in hot regions with varying daily temperature including direct solar radiation. Totally 315 temperature cycles and 90 cycles of wetting/drying were applied to specimens in this experiment. It was observed that temperature and humidity variations promote chloride penetration into marine concrete significantly. This particular study shows that thermally-induced microcracks increase, but slightly, the permeability of concrete in "restrained" beams compared to the relatively "stress free" small specimens.

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{synthesis}} of hyperbranched polyacetals via a melt transacetalization polymerization process. The process proceeds via the self-condensation of an AB(2) type monomer carrying a hydroxyl group and a dimethylacetal unit; the continuous removal of low boiling methanol drives the equilibrium toward polymer formation. Because of the susceptibility of the acetal linkage to hydrolysis, the polymer degrades readily under mildly acidic conditions to yield the corresponding hydroxyl aldehyde {{as the primary}} product. Furthermore, because of the unique topology of hyperbranched structures, the rate of polymer degradation was readily tuned by changing just {{the nature of the}} end-groups alone; instead of the dimethylacetal bearing monomer, longer chain dialkylacetals (dibutyl and dihexyl) monomers yielded hyperbranched polymers carrying longer alkyl groups at their molecular periphery. The highly branched topology and the relatively high volume fraction of the terminal alkyl groups resulted in a significant lowering of the <b>ingress</b> <b>rates</b> of the aqueous reagents to the loci of degradation, and consequently the degradation rates of the polymers were dramatically influenced by the hydrophobic nature of the terminal alkyl substituents. The simple synthesis and easy tunability of the degradation rates make these materials fairly attractive candidates for use as degradable scaffolds...|$|R

Due to the sizable difference in the network utilization between the peak and off-peak periods {{as well as the}} requirements of robust performance in face of both traffic burstiness and various types of network failures, these {{networks are}} significantly over-dimensioned for the average network loads.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} of reinforcements {{induced by}} chloride has {{resulted to be}} one of the most frequent causes of their premature damage. Most corrosion sensors were designed to monitor corrosion state in concrete, such as Anode-Ladder-System and Corrowatch System, which are widely used to monitor chloride ingress in marine concrete. However, the monitoring principle of these corrosion sensors is based on the macro-cell test method, so erroneous information may be obtained, especially from concrete under drying or saturated conditions due to concrete resistance taking control in macro-cell corrosion. In this paper, a fast weak polarization method to test corrosion state of reinforcements based on electrochemical polarization dynamics was proposed. Furthermore, a new corrosion sensor for monitoring the corrosion state of concrete cover was developed based on the proposed test method. The sensor was tested in cement mortar, with dry-wet cycle tests to accelerate the chloride <b>ingress</b> <b>rate.</b> The results show that the corrosion sensor can effectively monitor chloride penetration into concrete with little influence of the relative humidity in the concrete.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Most {{concrete}} {{structures are}} designed to last {{for at least a}} hundred years or more. During this lifetime the structure is exposed to several environmental influences. Whether a concrete structure can resist these environmental influences depends, among other things, on the <b>ingress</b> <b>rate</b> of liquids and gasses. The rate of ingress has a direct relation with the pore structure and its connectivity, inside the concrete. The pore structure and its connectivity are influenced by several factors during design and construction. An important factor during the construction phase is the curing of concrete. To achieve the requested durable structure the concrete has to be cured. To perform this curing several methods are applicable: liquid membrane, plastic film, fresh water etc. To investigate the effect of each curing method experiments are performed with two types of cement (CEM I and CEM III/B). The experiments consist of water penetration and rapid chloride migration tests. In the paper the results of the experiments are presented. Based on the results can be stated that concrete made with CEM III/B is more sensitive for curing than CEM I and it seems that water curing for concrete made with CEM I is less effective than for concrete made with CEM III/B. ...|$|E

Coatings with different thicknesses and kaolin contents were studied. Structural information of the dispersion-barrier coatings was obtained by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These {{results showed that the}} kaolin content influences both the orientation of the kaolin and the degree of crystallinity of the PVOH coating. Increased kaolin content increased the alignment of the kaolin platelets to the basal plane of the coating. Higher kaolin content was accompanied by higher degree of crystallinity of the PVOH. The barrier thickness proved to be less important {{in the early stages of}} the mass transport process, whereas it had a significant influence on the steady-state permeability.

40|$|Multidimensional {{data are}} {{becoming}} more prevalent, {{partly due to the}} rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), and with that the need to ingest and analyze data streams at rates higher than before. Some industrial IoT applications require ingesting millions of records per second, while processing queries on recently ingested and historical data. Unfortunately, existing database systems suited to multidimensional data exhibit low per-node ingestion performance, and even if they can scale horizontally in distributed settings, they require large number of nodes to meet such ingest demands. For this reason, in this paper we evaluate a single-node multidimensional data store for high-velocity sensor data. Its design centers around a two-level indexing structure, wherein the global index is an in-memory R*-tree and the local indices are serialized kd-trees. This study is confined to records with numerical indexing fields and range queries, and covers ingest throughput, query response time, and storage footprint. We show that the adopted design streamlines data ingestion and offers <b>ingress</b> <b>rates</b> two orders of magnitude higher than those of Percona Server, SQLite, and Druid. Our prototype also reports query response times comparable to or better than those of Percona Server and Druid, and compares favorably in terms of storage footprint. In addition, we evaluate a kd-tree partitioning based scheme for grouping incoming streamed data records. Compared to a random scheme, this scheme produces less overlap between groups of streamed records, but contrary to what we expected, such reduced overlap does not translate into better query performance. By contrast, the local indices prove much more beneficial to query performance. We believe the experience reported in this paper is valuable to practitioners and researchers alike interested in building database systems for high-velocity multidimensional data...|$|R
40|$|Natural analogues of Portland cement {{can provide}} {{insights}} into carbonation processes operating over timescales {{of interest to}} performance assessments of CO 2 storage. Two such sites in Northern Ireland (Scawt Hill and Carneal Plug) have been investigated, where carbonation reactions of naturally-occurring cement minerals can be observed. Here, partially hydrated larnite-rich nodules have been reacting with atmospheric CO 2 or dissolved bicarbonate ions at low temperatures over the last 10 – 20 thousand years. This has produced rims of carbonate minerals around hydrated low-temperature calcium silicate (CSH) minerals enclosing residual cores of primary high-temperature metamorphic calcium silicates and calcium aluminates (dominated by larnite, and often accompanied by wollastonite, spurrite, paraspurrite, brownmillerite, bredigite, andradite-grossular) with carbonation proceeding progressively from the outer margins of the nodules. Calcite and scawtite are the dominant secondary calcium carbonate minerals, but vaterite and aragonite have also formed. The carbonation produces dense, low-porosity carbonate rims. This {{is associated with a}} reduction in volume, accompanied by shrinkage and microfracturing of the underlying residual poorly crystalline CSH gel and its silica-rich alteration product, which has created significant secondary porosity in the altered material. Although some secondary calcium carbonate reaction products may partially mineralise the fractures, they do not seal the fractures completely, allowing further ingress of CO 2 /bicarbonate. That said, the <b>ingress</b> <b>rate</b> has not been sufficient to completely carbonate the nodules, even after several thousand years.

40|$|Concrete constructions in {{the marine}} {{environment}} suffer from chemical attack of sea salts which can induce damage to both the concrete matrix and embedded steel reinforcement. For example, ingress of sulfate and chloride ions can respectively result in detrimental ettringite formation and enhanced corrosion of the steel rebars. The first degradation mechanism is due to development of expansive minerals within the concrete matrix, a process where increased internal pressure can result in crack formation. Cracking dramatically increases matrix porosity further enhancing the <b>ingress</b> <b>rate</b> of detrimental chemicals. However, with controlled mineral expansion comes {{the possibility of an}} employable mechanism for autonomous sealing of cracks. In this research project our aim is to study the potential for carbon dioxide producing bacteria to act as an agent to control expansive carbonation reactions following serpentinization (hydration reactions) of alkaline precursor minerals in marine concrete. Early experimental results showed that seawater derived magnesium ions and carbon dioxide molecules show high potential for self-healing due to the formation of crack-filling expansive minerals. Environmental scanning electron microscopy combined with X-ray element analysis revealed that dolomite (CaMg(CO 3) 2) formation via intermediate conversion of brucite (Mg(OH) 2) is the mechanism underlying this process. Several previously documented studies have reported that dolomite formation, analogous to delayed ettringite formation, can be detrimental to concrete as it can in fact induce crack formation due to increased internal stresses. In this project our aim is to control expansive mineral formation by bacterial CO 2 production channelling the process for healing- but not for causing cracks in concrete constructions {{in the marine}} environment...|$|E

Traditional means of evaluating perfusion {{before and after}} revascularization are often limited {{by the presence of}} medial calcinosis, open wounds, prior toe or forefoot amputations, and infection. We evaluated the initial application of indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) to patients with severe lower extremity ischemia to develop quantitative, reproducible parameters to assess perfusion. MethodsICGA uses a charge-coupled device camera, a laser, and intravenous contrast to visually assess skin surface perfusion. From January 2011 to April 2012, we performed ICGA within 5 days of 31 revascularization procedures in patients with Rutherford class 5 and 6 ischemia. We also compared ICGA before and after revascularization in a subset of 13 patients. We evaluated multiple, quantitative parameters to assess perfusion. ResultsTwenty-four patients underwent ICGA associated with 31 revascularization procedures (26 endovascular, four open, one hybrid) for 26 lower limb wounds; 92 % were diabetic and 20 % were dialysis-dependent. In 50 % of these patients, {{it was not possible to}} measure ankle-brachial indexes due to medial calcinosis.

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} catch, trap {{fishing power}} and reef fish trappability were investigated by experimental fishing with Antillean fish traps on west coast fringing reefs in Barbados. Commercial (small mesh) traps caught significantly more fish (by number and weight), caught significantly smaller fish, {{and caught a}} higher proportion of immature fish, than large mesh traps. Fishing power was significantly higher for commercial traps than for large mesh traps. These catch differences between trap types have serious implications for the management of the reef fish resource by the imposition of larger mesh sizes in the commercial fishery. The squeezability hypothesis and the visual image hypothesis were investigated as explanations for the lower fishing power of large mesh traps. The lower fishing power of large mesh traps results primarily from lower catch rates of fish in the 5. 5 - 6. 0 cm body depth size class. This result is strong support for the squeezability hypothesis as an explanation for the lower fishing power of large mesh traps. Differences in the visual images of traps created by structural differences and biotic differences did not produce definitive differences in <b>ingress</b> <b>rates</b> to traps, suggesting that the visual image hypothesis is an inadequate explanation for the lower fishing power of large mesh traps. The trappability of reef fish differed substantially between species, but trappability differences were not correlated with species mobility, activity of the species in traps, gregariousness, or capacity of the species to squeeze through meshes. Predator-prey effects on trappability were negligible, but trappability was negatively correlated with percent reef cover of the substratum and with substratum rugosity. This suggests that traps are more attractive to fishes in areas where natural structural complexity is lower. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
