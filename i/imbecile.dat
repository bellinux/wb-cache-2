5|$|Given {{the social}} circumstances, {{politically}} oriented social problem films ridiculed politicians and portrayed them as incompetent bumblers, scoundrels, and liars. In The Dark Horse (1932), Warren William is again enlisted, {{this time to}} get an <b>imbecile,</b> who is accidentally in the running for Governor, elected. The candidate wins the election despite his incessant, embarrassing mishaps. Washington Merry-Go-Round portrayed the state of a political system stuck in neutral. Columbia Pictures nearly released the film with a scene of the public execution of a politician as the climax before deciding to cut it.|$|E
5|$|Madhoji Bhonsle, {{also known}} as Appa Saheb, {{consolidated}} his power in Nagpur after {{the murder of his}} cousin, the <b>imbecile</b> ruler Parsoji Bhonsle. He entered into a treaty with the British on 27 May 1816. He ignored the request of the British Resident Jenkins to refrain from contact with Baji Rao II. Jenkins asked Appa Saheb to disband his growing concentration of troops and come to the residency, which he also refused to do. Appa Saheb openly declared support for the Peshwa, who was already fighting the British near Pune. As it was now clear that a battle was in the offing, Jenkins asked for reinforcements from nearby British East India Company troops. He already had about 1,500 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Hopentoun Scott. Jenkins sent word for Colonel Adams to march to Nagpur with his troops. Like other Maratha leaders, Appa Shaeb employed Arabs in his army. They were typically involved in holding fortresses. While they were known to be among the bravest of troops, they were not amenable to discipline and order. The total strength of the Marathas was about 18,000.|$|E
25|$|The 19thcentury also {{witnessed}} {{the establishment of}} the Scottish National Institution for the Education of <b>Imbecile</b> Children on land to the north of present-day Larbert. The institution, opened in 1863 at a cost of £13,000, provided care for minors between the age of 5 and 21. In 1948 the facility became known as the Royal Scottish National Hospital (RSNH). On adjacent land, the Stirling District Lunatic Asylum, opened in 1869 at a cost of £20,000, engaged in the treatment of those with mental illness. The asylum later became known as Bellsdyke Hospital.|$|E

25|$|Briefly, Saxo's {{version of}} Hamlet's history is as follows: Gervendill, {{governor}} of Jutland, was succeeded by his sons Horvendill and Feng. Horvendill, {{on his return}} from a Viking expedition {{in which he had}} slain Koll, king of Norway, married Gerutha, daughter of Rørik Slyngebond, king of Denmark; she bore him a son, Amleth. But Feng, out of jealousy, murdered Horvendill, and persuaded Gerutha to become his wife, on the plea that he had committed the crime {{for no other reason than}} to avenge her of a husband who had hated her. Amleth, afraid of sharing his father's fate, pretended to be an <b>imbecile,</b> but the suspicion of Feng put him to various tests which are related in detail. Among other things they sought to entangle him with a young girl, his foster-sister (the prototype of Ophelia), but his cunning saved him. When, however, Amleth slew the eavesdropper hidden (like Polonius in Shakespeare's play), in his mother's room, and destroyed all trace of the deed, Feng was assured that the young man's madness was feigned. Accordingly, he dispatched him to Britain in company with two attendants, who bore a letter enjoining the king of the country to put him to death. Amleth surmised the purport of their instructions, and secretly altered the message on their wooden tablets to the effect that the king should put the attendants to death and give Amleth his daughter in marriage.|$|E
500|$|After Holmes {{resigned}} his professorship at Dartmouth, {{he composed}} {{a series of}} three lectures dedicated to exposing medical fallacies, or [...] "quackeries". Adopting a more serious tone than his previous lectures, he took great pains to reveal the false reasoning and misrepresentation of evidence that marked subjects such as [...] "Astrology and Alchemy", his first lecture, and [...] "Medical Delusions of the Past", his second. He deemed homeopathy, the subject of his third lecture, [...] "the pretended science" [...] that was a [...] "mingled mass of perverse ingenuity, of tinsel erudition, of <b>imbecile</b> credulity, and of artful misrepresentation, too often mingled in practice". In 1842, he published the essay [...] "Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions" [...] in which he again denounced the practice.|$|E
500|$|Friday saw {{yet more}} {{witnesses}} for the prosecution, {{bringing the total}} brought by Davy to about 60. [...] The defence questioned several of those present at the original search of Wells's house. [...] Canning's uncle, Thomas Colley, was cross-examined about what his niece ate on her visit of New Year's Day, the prosecution apparently seeking to establish {{whether or not she}} could have been sustained for a month by the bread she claimed to have been given. [...] On the third day of the trial, Mrs Canning was brought to the stand. [...] One possible line of defence for her daughter was simply that she was too stupid to have ever invented the tale, but under cross-examination by Davy Mrs Canning demonstrated that her daughter was capable of writing [...] "a little". [...] This, in Davy's view, was sufficient to demonstrate that she was certainly no <b>imbecile.</b> [...] Scarrat was questioned next, and admitted that he had been to Wells's house before Canning had disappeared. [...] Two of Canning's neighbours testified to her [...] "deplorable condition". [...] Her employer was questioned, as was her apothecary, who thought that Canning would have been quite able to survive on the pitcher of water and crusts of bread she claimed to have been given. [...] The defence responded with three witnesses, who each believed that they had encountered a [...] "poor, miserable wretch" [...] at the end of January, when she claimed to have escaped.|$|E

2500|$|Also in December 1933, Credința {{hosted a}} plea {{in favor of}} anti-fascist {{political}} activism. Signed by Stahl, the opinion piece proposed that political involvement was a civic duty, citing fascism as the enemy of freedom, and also implying that [...] "Bolshevik" [...] communism was [...] "left-wing fascism". Eliade supported that stance, {{in the name of}} non-racial [...] "Romanianism", noting that both political extremes advanced [...] "a dictatorship of the brute, of the <b>imbecile,</b> of the incompetent." [...] Also in Credința, philosopher Constantin Noica spoke out against the advocates of cultural isolation and nativism. His articles of 1933 and 1934 noted that Romanian culture was eminently parochial, and openly criticized Gândirea traditionalism. Noica also rejected the political ambitions of his generation colleagues. During the 1933 election, he recommended passive resistance and abstention, rather than ideological combat, as methods of raising awareness at the top. Four years before his own conversion to fascism, Noica's Credința texts described Romanian youths as being [...] "diseased with politics".|$|E
2500|$|Kricfalusi {{originally}} voiced Ren in {{a manner}} that he describes as [...] "a bad imitation of Peter Lorre." [...] Billy West said that he auditioned to play Ren; the creators of the series believed that having West—who was also voicing the title character in fellow charter Nicktoon Doug at the time—voice both Ren and Stimpy would give him too large of a workload. West voiced Ren after Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi; Kricfalusi would return for the Spike TV episodes and unaired episodes of The Ren & Stimpy Show. Chris Edgerly would voice the character in the game Nicktoons MLB though. In the pilot episode, Pierre Decelles provided Ren's signature diabolical laughter, while West performed Ren's laugh in the series. His catchphrase is [...] "You eediot", and he also uses variations of [...] "What is your problem, you sick little monkey?", which is similar to a quote by Lorre in The Maltese Falcon: [...] "You... you <b>imbecile.</b> You bloated idiot. You stupid fat-head, you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{re-election}} in the 1945 general election on 5 July, Herbert noted {{of the new}} Parliament that [...] "the surge of Socialism into the House of Commons was something to see." [...] The Labour Party, under Clement Attlee, had won 393 seats, and the Conservatives had won only 197. Herbert said of the newly elected Labour MPs that [...] "Arrogance, I am sorry to say, remained. There was such a concerto of nastiness and hate and <b>imbecile</b> yelling, that I thanked God, many times, that I was an Independent and could be silent without disloyalty." [...] Herbert campaigned {{to ensure that the}} newly elected MPs realised the significance of private members' time. He prepared a number of private member's bills, including on betting reform, legal aid for the poor, a fairer voting system, and the abolition of decree nisi, among other things. However, [...] was unsuccessful in his first attempt to guarantee private members' time – later in the Parliament, it would be restored.|$|E

2500|$|When {{experimental}} psychology came to Britain, Francis Galton was {{a leading}} practitioner, and, with his procedures for measuring reaction time and sensation, is considered an inventor of modern mental testing (also known as psychometrics). James McKeen Cattell, a student of Wundt and Galton, brought the concept to the United States, and in fact coined the term [...] "mental test". In 1901, Cattell's student Clark Wissler published discouraging results, suggesting that mental testing of Columbia and Barnard students failed to predict their academic performance. In response to 1904 orders from the Minister of Public Instruction, French psychologists Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon elaborated a new test of intelligence in 1905–1911, using a range of questions diverse in their nature and difficulty. Binet and Simon introduced the concept of mental age and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as idiots. Henry H. Goddard put the Binet-Simon scale to work and introduced classifications of mental level such as <b>imbecile</b> and feebleminded. In 1916 (after Binet's death), Stanford professor Lewis M. Terman modified the Binet-Simon scale (renamed the Stanford–Binet scale) and introduced the intelligence quotient as a score report. From this test, Terman concluded that mental retardation [...] "represents the level of intelligence which is very, very common among Spanish-Indians and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes. Their dullness seems to be racial." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte {{returned}} to Paris and {{took part in}} the legislative elections. Though he stayed in London, was a Swiss citizen he did not campaign, he was overwhelmingly elected in five departments. On September he {{returned to}} Paris and took a residence on Place Vendôme. The first appearance of Louis-Napoleon at the Assembly, his Germanic accent and awkward speaking style, persuaded Thiers and other Deputies that he was minus habens; an <b>imbecile.</b> This was also the view of Ledru-Rollin and the socialist deputies. The new Assembly voted to hold elections for a new President of the Republic, the first in which all Frenchmen with residences could vote. Elections were set for 10 December 1848. Thiers considered running, but told Falloux, another Deputy: [...] "If I lost it would be a grave setback for the ideas of order; [...] if I won, I would be obliged to embrace the ideas of the Republic, and, in truth, I [...] am too honest a lad to marry such a bad woman.". [...] Instead, he made the major mistake of his political career; he decided to support to Louis-Napoleon, certain that he could control him. He believed that Louis-Napoleon's term would be failure, which would open the way for Thiers to run in 1852. On the eve of the vote, Thiers hosted Louis-Napoleon at his home for dinner. In the December 1848 elections, the moderate republican Lamartine received just 18,000 votes; the socialist Ledru-Rollin received 371,000, and the conservative General Cavaignac received 1,448,000 votes. Louis-Napoleon received 5,345,000 votes, or three-quarters of the votes cast.|$|E
