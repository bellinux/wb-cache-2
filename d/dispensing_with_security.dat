Her many criticisms include their refusal to use racial profiling as a component of airport screening. After a group of Muslims was expelled from a US Airways flight when other passengers expressed concern, sparking a call for Muslims to boycott the airline because of the ejection from a flight of six imams, Coulter wrote: If only we could get Muslims to boycott all airlines, we could <b>dispense</b> <b>with</b> airport <b>security</b> altogether.|$|R

By 2012, Narita's operator was considering <b>dispensing</b> <b>with</b> the <b>security</b> checks. Given {{that the number of}} flight slots at Narita are also increasing, the anti-airport struggles were a long time ago, and Haneda Airport in Tokyo shaping up as a more serious competitor, a council headed by Chiba governor Kensaku Morita consisting of prefectural government officials, the Narita International Airport Corporation and business groups in Narita, proposed scrapping the ID checks. The Chiba prefectural police objected, stating that the checks were necessary to detect extremists and terrorists.|$|R
2500|$|Machiavelli {{explains}} {{repeatedly that}} religion is man-made, and {{that the value of}} religion lies in its contribution to social order and the rules of morality must be <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> if <b>security</b> requires it. In The Prince, the Discourses, and in the Life of Castruccio Castracani, he describes [...] "prophets", as he calls them, like Moses, Romulus, Cyrus the Great, and Theseus (he treated pagan and Christian patriarchs in the same way) as the greatest of new princes, the glorious and brutal founders of the most novel innovations in politics, and men whom Machiavelli assures us have always used a large amount of armed force and murder against their own people. He estimated that these sects last from 1,666 to 3,000 years each time, which, as pointed out by Leo Strauss, would mean that Christianity became due to start finishing about 150 years after Machiavelli. Machiavelli's concern with Christianity as a sect was that it makes men weak and inactive, delivering politics into the hands of cruel and wicked men without a fight.|$|R

50|$|Critique of nominalist reconstructions in mathematics:A {{critique}} of nominalist reconstructions in mathematics was undertaken by Burgess (1983) and Burgess and Rosen (1997). Burgess distinguished {{two types of}} nominalist reconstructions. Thus, hermeneutic nominalism is the hypothesis that science, properly interpreted, already <b>dispenses</b> <b>with</b> mathematical objects(entities) such as numbers and sets. Meanwhile, revolutionary nominalism is the project of replacing current scientific theories by alternatives <b>dispensing</b> <b>with</b> mathematical objects (see Burgess, 1983, p. 96). A recent study extends the Burgessian critique to three nominalistic reconstructions: the reconstruction of analysis by Georg Cantor, Richard Dedekind, and Karl Weierstrass that <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> infinitesimals; the constructivist re-reconstruction of Weiertrassian analysis by Errett Bishop that <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> the law of excluded middle; and the hermeneutic reconstruction, by Carl Boyer, Judith Grabiner, and others, of Cauchy's foundational contribution to analysis that <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> Cauchy's infinitesimals.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} reduction in the percentage of cases where bail is <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> (unconditional release) is due to a change in the profile of cases coming before the criminal courts or a general increase in the threshold for <b>dispensing</b> <b>with</b> bail. A series of statistical (logistic regression) models of the likelihood of unconditional release were constructed to see whether the fall in the likelihood of unconditional release over time remained significant after adjusting for other factors associated with the likelihood of unconditional release. Separate models were constructed for three offences: assault, property crime and property damage. The report concludes that {{the reduction in}} matters where bail is <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> is not accounted for by a change in the profile of cases coming before the courts. Instead, this appears to reflect an increase in the threshold for <b>dispensing</b> <b>with</b> bail...|$|R
