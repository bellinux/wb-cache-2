40|$|Graduation date: 1964 During 1963 and 1964 {{collections}} {{were made}} in tributaries of the lower Columbia River and literature was reviewed to compile a list of fishes from that area. Based on available sources and collections in this study, a total of 28 families and 77 species are known from the lower Columbia River. Most of the fishes are marine or have marine affinities. Freshwater fishes include eight families and 29 species, but only three families and eight species are primary. In the Columbia River the peripheral family Cottidae reaches great development {{in the absence of}} a more extensive primary fauna. Seven of the 12 species of Cottus known from the basin occur in the lower tributaries and were found to be the most widespread species there. LocaI distribution of 25 selected species is discussed, and used to gain an understanding of the relationship of the fauna of the Columbia River with the fauna of the Puget <b>Sound</b> <b>drainage</b> and coastal streams of Oregon and Washington. These 25 selected species included 17 species which are recorded from the lower Columbia River, and eight other species which are possibly present there. A number of species occur throughout the Columbia River basin and may have interchanged with other drainages at several points. The absence of several species from the Puget <b>Sound</b> <b>drainage</b> was associated with their absence from tributaries of the lower Columbia River. Because these species were absent from the lower tributaries, they were apparently unable to take advantage of the dispersal route north of the lower Columbia River.

40|$|Program (WASSIP) is {{a unique}} {{collaboration}} among stakeholders and scientists to address long-standing questions about harvest patterns of chum and sockeye salmon in western Alaska fisheries. Born from frustration with widely divergent regulatory decisions based on limited and controversial data, WASSIP created a framework for representatives from affected stakeholders in western Alaska to collectively design a scientific study to address critical information gaps in a highly contentious commercial and subsistence fishing environment. While engaged in the largest salmon genetics study ever conducted (collecting over 325, 000 samples), we established a process where representatives of major regional fishery interests accepted responsibility {{for the design of}} scientific investigations that would inform regulatory decisions they must live with.

It has been prepared mainly as a record of these trips and for the assistance of the soils engineer on the job. It will be seen, from the report, that the soils encountered were not unusual, even though at first they may have appeared to be so. As it so often the case with soils in Northern Canada, it was the combination of northern soil types with excessive amounts of water (due to local conditons) which appears to have created the worst problems.

40|$|Introduction: Roads are {{essential}} for the functioning of modern society, and {{play a key role}} in the carriage and distribution of goods, services and people. There are however concerns about their role in a sustainable world. Objective: To examine the advantages and disadvantages of sustainable road development and management, with a view to asking whether it is possible to achieve truly sustainable roads. Description of the Issues: Modern roads need to be planned, designed, constructed, maintained and disposed of sustainably. Issues in such sustainable road development and management include planning and design for sustainable transportation, management of storm water and runoff, design and construction for minimal impact on the natural environment, use of sustainable and recycled materials, whole of life asset management, and the use of sustainable construction and maintenance processes. Thus the close attention to <b>drainage</b> systems, <b>sound</b> environmental management, water sensitive urban design, use of advanced environmentally friendly materials, and environmentally responsible project management are important considerations in the sustainable development and management of roads. Key roads should also have continued functionality during and immediately after major natural disasters. Therefore, the design and construction of such roads and their associated structures should take into account their viability as transportation links in all but the most extreme of operating conditions. Conclusion: An evaluation is undertaken of the issues in sustainable road development and management, with a view to assessing whether it is possible to achieve truly sustainable roads in the broader context of minimising the human environmental footprint. ...|$|R
40|$|Irrigated {{agriculture}} {{is threatened by}} soil salinity in numerous arid and semiarid areas of the Mediterranean basin. The objective of this work was to quantify soil salinity through electromagnetic induction (EMI) techniques and relate it to the physical characteristics and irrigation management of four Mediterranean irrigation districts located in Morocco, Spain, Tunisia and Turkey. The volume and salinity of the main water inputs (irrigation and precipitation) and outputs (crop evapotranspiration and drainage) were measured or estimated in each district. Soil salinity (ECe) maps were obtained through electromagnetic induction surveys (ECa readings) and district-specific ECa-ECe calibrations. Gravimetric soil water content (WC) and soil saturation percentage (SP) were also measured in the soil calibration samples. The ECa-ECe calibration equations were highly significant (PÂ  Â  0. 1) with WC, and was only significantly correlated (PÂ  Â Morocco (2. 2 Â dSÂ m- 1) Â >Â Spain (1. 4 Â dSÂ m- 1) Â >Â Turkey (0. 45 Â dSÂ m- 1). Soil salinity was mainly affected by irrigation water salinity and irrigation efficiency. Drainage water salinity at the exit of each district was mostly affected by soil salinity and irrigation efficiency, with values very high in Tunisia (9. 0 Â dSÂ m- 1), high in Spain (4. 6 Â dSÂ m- 1), moderate in Morocco (estimated at 2. 6 Â dSÂ m- 1), and low in Turkey (1. 4 Â dSÂ m- 1). Salt loads in drainage waters, calculated from their salinity (ECdw) and volume (Q), were highest in Tunisia (very high Q and very high ECdw), intermediate in Turkey (extremely high Q and low ECdw) and lowest in Spain (very low Q and high ECdw) (there were no Q data for Morocco). Reduction of these high <b>drainage</b> volumes through <b>sound</b> irrigation management {{would be the most}} efficient way to control the off-site salt-pollution caused by these Mediterranean irrigation districts.

40|$|Understanding {{the effect}} of human {{activities}} on the soil environment is fundamental to understanding global change and sustainable development. In the process of transformation of tropical rain forests and semiarid grasslands to farmlands, land degradation usually occurs. But the transformation of arid desert landscape to oasis is found to have quite different consequences. Taking an alluvial plain oasis in the north piedmont (if the Tianshan Mountains as a case study, we investigate oasis soil properties related to different land-use systems during the transformation of and desert to oases. Selected land-use systems consisted of an annual crop field less than 3 years old, annual crop field 3 - 6 years old, annual crop field more than 6 years old, perennial crop field less than 4 years old, perennial crop field of 4 - 6 years old, perennial crop field more than 6 years old, abandoned farmland more than 3 years old, woodland field more than 6 years old, ecological forestation field, natural shrubbery field, desert grass land, and saline or alkaline field. Different land-use systems affect significantly the distribution of sand, silt and clay. Sand content in oasis soil tends to decrease with cultivation years but silt and clay contents tend to be increased in the oasis soils. Soil fertility is higher in the land-use systems under strong human disturbance than under weak human disturbance. Oasis soil nutrients also tend to increase with cultivation years. Soils have a significantly lower salinity in the land-use systems under strong human disturbance than under weak human disturbance. Soil organic matter and nutrients of the annual and perennial crop systems in the oasis tend to increase with cultivation time with the oasis soil acting as a carbon sink. These results show that soils are not degraded and the soil quality is gradually improved under rational land use and scientific management patterns, including uniform exploitation of land resources, effective irrigation systems, <b>sound</b> <b>drainage</b> systems, balanced fertilizer application, crushed straw return to soil and transformation of annual crop fields to perennial ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{research}} {{work is to}} analyze indicators of geological, geographical and climatological processes of evolution of seabed conditions of Northern Baffin Bay and adjacent areas in the Last Glacial Maximum to Holocene. Baffin Bay is the northwestern extension and terminus of the North Atlantic-Labrador Sea rift system. Geophysical and geologic observations in Baffin Bay indicate that {{the origin of the}} bay may be ascribed to sea-floor spreading. Author participated in “IMAGES-International Polar Year-Canada expedition for the study of Climate and Ocean changes in eastern Canadian Arctic (Baffin Bay, Davies Strait) ” (“Baffin Bay- 2008 ”) onboard of CCGS “Hudson”. The “Baffin Bay- 2008 ” cruise in the Baffin Bay, funded by the CFCAS and NSERC of Canada was a great success. Hudson expedition 2008 - 029 was a joint effort undertaken by the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) and an academic group led by Geochemistry and Geodynamic Research Center (GEOTOP) {{and a number of other}} national and international research groups (herein referred to as the GEOTOP group). The 27 day mission left from Nain, NL on August 28 th and returned to the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, NS on September 23 rd 2008. Both groups have a shared interest in conducting marine geological research in Baffin Bay and adjacent areas. Due to joint effort of Canadian and international scientists, the cruise permitted to collect high quality piston and box cores, plankton tows, physical and chemical water column data. Northern Baffin Bay includes the North Water Polynya where the high biogenic fluxes should allow establishment of high resolution records of productivity vs. sea-surface condition changes. But a major depocentre is present at the northern end of the Baffin shelf opposite the mouth of Lancaster Sound. Sedimentation has been characterized by the influx of coarse elastic material across the rifted and rapidly foundering margin of Baffin Island. The sediments were derived from the surrounding highlands of the Baffin coast and by clastics brought from the lower Paleozoic hinterland of the Canadian Arctic Islands by major rift controlled <b>drainage</b> systems. Lancaster <b>Sound</b> is an area of competing interests with potential future hydrocarbon exploration, marine transport through the Northwest Passage, and the proposed establishment of a marine park within the area. The nature of the recent sediments in this region, and their geochemical properties relative to water depth, bottom configuration, and the agents responsible for their transport were studied by analyzing samples from 2 expeditions: samples from box-corers from “Baffin Bay- 2008 ” cruise, and gravity core PS 72 - 287 / 3 from “ARK-XXIII/ 3 ” cruise (RV „Polarstern“, 2008). Samples from box-corers were compared for 8 locations from different parts of northern Baffin Bay.
