25|$|Although Willow Bunch was {{consistently}} populated by {{farms in the}} early 1900s, the economic landscape began changing in the 1920s and continues to change today. Entering the 1930s, Willow Bunchâ€™s district saw as many as 8,939 active farms. The Great Depression factored into the disappearance of numerous smaller farms, while large farms grew. During this time the number of farms decreased, while the average farm size increased by 73 acres. Entering 1941 the average size of farms became larger, {{and the amount of}} farms decreased from 8,939 to 8,002. This trend continued into the 1950s, with a government survey recording 421 farms in 1951 and 354 farms in 1956. Again, the average size of farms increased while the number of farms decreased. The trend continues, with a 2011 Statistics Canada report noting only 102 farms remain in the Willow Bunch area (with under 2,000 in the greater District). Furthermore, the majority of farms in the province span 1,600-2,239 acres, while smaller farms (under 200 acres) are becoming a minority. In response to larger farms, small organic farms <b>have</b> <b>sprung</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Willow Bunch. Although these farms are small, the prices commanded by organic goods allows these farms to operate comfortably.|$|E
