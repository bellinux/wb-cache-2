5|$|Abandoned mercury mine {{processing}} sites often contain very {{hazardous waste}} piles of roasted cinnabar calcines. Water run-off <b>from</b> <b>such</b> sites is a recognized source of ecological damage. Former mercury mines may be suited for constructive re-use. For example, in 1976 Santa Clara County, California purchased the historic Almaden Quicksilver Mine {{and created a}} county park on the site, after conducting extensive safety and environmental analysis of the property.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{dominant}} scholarly view during the late 19th {{and much of the}} 20th century, Roman religion was originally animistic, directed towards spirits associated with specific objects or activities which were only later perceived as gods with independent personal existence.

5|$|After {{recovering}} from his hip surgery, Costello returned to active competition at age 56. The {{fact that he}} was able to recover <b>from</b> <b>such</b> a major injury is credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living.

5|$|Another {{educational}} work is De schematibus et tropis sacrae scripturae, which {{discusses the}} Bible's use of rhetoric. Bede {{was familiar with}} pagan authors such as Virgil, {{but it was not}} considered appropriate to teach biblical grammar <b>from</b> <b>such</b> texts, and in De schematibus... Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature. Similarly, his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} stylistic {{influence was}} the experimental oeuvre of Kenneth Anger, {{and in particular}} Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. Noé saw Anger's films in the early 1990s, while promoting the short film Carne, and quickly became a fan. Other influences from experimental cinema included the works of Jordan Belson and Peter Tscherkassky. Noé's favourite film, , was the most prominent influence among mainstream films; Noé {{wanted to become a}} filmmaker after he saw it at the age of seven. Brian De Palma's Snake Eyes and other films which feature hovering overhead shots inspired Noé to make a film largely <b>from</b> <b>such</b> a perspective.|$|E

5|$|Emperors of the {{proceeding}} Song dynasty (960–1279) {{tended to}} marry from {{within their own}} borders.

It has been estimated that only a quarter of Song consorts were <b>from</b> <b>such</b> families, with the rest being from lower status backgrounds.

5|$|In Australia, the {{introduction}} of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) by British settlers in the 19th century led to significant reductions in loggerhead sea turtle populations. In one coastal section in eastern Australia during the 1970s, predation of turtle eggs destroyed up to 95% of all clutches laid. Aggressive efforts to destroy foxes in the 1980s and 1990s has reduced this impact; however, it is estimated that it will be the year 2020 before populations will experience complete recovery <b>from</b> <b>such</b> dramatic losses.|$|E
5|$|In a liquid, powder or {{amorphous}} sample, molecules {{within that}} sample are in random orientations. Such samples have a continuous Fourier spectrum that uniformly spreads its amplitude {{thereby reducing the}} measured signal intensity, as is observed in SAXS. More importantly, the orientational information is lost. Although theoretically possible, it is experimentally difficult to obtain atomic-resolution structures of complicated, asymmetric molecules <b>from</b> <b>such</b> rotationally averaged data. An intermediate case is fiber diffraction in which the subunits are arranged periodically {{in at least one}} dimension.|$|E

Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E
