5|$|On 30 November 2011, the ECB, the US Federal Reserve, {{the central}} banks of Canada, Japan, Britain and the Swiss National Bank {{provided}} global financial markets with additional liquidity {{to ward off}} the debt crisis and to support the real economy. The central banks agreed to lower the cost of dollar currency swaps by 50 basis points to come into effect on 5 December 2011. They also agreed to provide each other with abundant liquidity to make sure that commercial banks stay liquid <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>currencies.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{has been}} a {{particular}} problem with nickels and dimes (and with some comparable coins <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>currencies)</b> because of their relatively low face value and unstable commodity prices. For a while the copper in US pennies was worth more than one cent, so people would hoard pennies and then melt them down for their metal value. It cost more than face value to manufacture pennies or nickels, so any widespread loss of the coins in circulation could be expensive for the US Treasury. This {{was more of a}} problem when coins were still made of precious metals like silver and gold, so strict laws against alteration make more sense historically.|$|E
500|$|The war worsened {{currency}} and finance problems in Massachusetts. [...] The province had been issuing paper currency since the 1690s, {{and the issue}} of large amounts of this currency was causing it to depreciate relative to precious metals used <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>currencies.</b> [...] The question of how to resolve the situation caused a division between the colonists and the governor which was not repaired until the 1760s. [...] Business leaders who borrowed money were happy to pay it back later with depreciated currency, while lenders sought reforms to stabilize the currency. [...] In 1714, a major proposal was floated by Dudley's opponents in which a land bank would issue as much as £50,000 in currency, secured by the shareholder's properties. [...] Dudley was opposed to this scheme, and instead convinced the provincial legislature to issue £50,000 in bills of credit. [...] The financially powerful interests whom he upset with this move proved to be his downfall.|$|E
