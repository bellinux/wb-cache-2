40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. In {{this study}} three novel methods for the removal/recovery of {{inorganic}} salts from aqueous solution were explored {{to make a}} contribution to ongoing efforts by the petroleum industry to upgrade waste water for reuse by immobilising and removing inorganic substances from such contaminated water. These methods were targeted precipitation, supercritical treatment and eutectic freeze crystallisation. The feasibility of these methods for waste water treatment was investigated by using both simple laboratory prepared solutions and complex real-world waste water samples (TRO and EDR brine) from the petroleum industry. Different analytical techniques, including simple and complexometric titrations (AgNO 3, EDTA), ICP-MS and IC were utilised to analyse original solutions and filtrates collected after precipitation by the different methods for several key anions/cations typically found in the waste water of a petroleum industry. The method of targeted precipitation entailed an adjustment of the molar ratio of species in laboratory and industrial solutions to effect precipitation of a target compound having a favourable stoichiometry to remove large amounts of anions/cations from solution. It was successful for the removal of sulphate ion from both simple synthetic solutions (> 85 %) and complex real-world solutions (50 % for TRO and 75 % for EDR). The optimum chloride ion removal from synthetic solutions (60 %) was obtained by using a slightly different molar ratio than planned, but from the industrial brines disappointingly low chloride ion removal (25 % for TRO, 12 % for EDR) was achieved. The second method required laboratory and industrial solutions to be subjected to conditions (typically 218 atm and 400 °C) at which water is a supercritical fluid. The polar character, hydrogen bonding and ion solvating capability of water are destroyed under such conditions, so that ionic species are forced out of solution. The removal of sulphate ion from synthetic solutions was just as successful (80 %) as targeted precipitation, though redissolution occurred over time as a result of competition with other ions for hydrating water molecules. A vast amount of sulphate (1000 mg/L or 28 % for TRO and 3500 mg/L or 35 % for EDR) was removed under supercritical water conditions, and large amounts of sodium (450 mg/L or 31 % for TRO, 1300 mg/L or 41 % for EDR) and calcium (450 mg/L or 85 % for TRO, 600 mg/L or 90 % for EDR) precipitated in addition to sulphate. Chloride ion removal was disappointingly low and never exceeded 15 % for synthetic and 8 % for real-world <b>solutions.</b> <b>Eutectic</b> freeze crystallisation was used in successive fractionations to remove substantial amounts of simple inorganic salts, such as Na 2 SO 4 (67 %) and Na 2 CO 3 (31 %), from pre-prepared <b>eutectic</b> <b>solutions.</b> Application of the technique to industrial waste water samples in seven successive fractionations led to collective removal of 20 % of sulphate and 18 % of chloride content of TRO and 60 % of sulphate and 15 % of chloride content of EDR waste water samples. The reliability of the operation to precipitate and collect ice-salt mixtures in several successive fractionations was proven by a proper mass balance enabled by analysis of the original solution, the filtrates after each collection and the residual mother liquid. The study rendered a modest contribution to the treatment of industrial waste water for the sake of mineral recovery and water restoration. It identified, applied and evaluated novel methods of waste water treatment in order to expand knowledge in this field and to broaden the capability of industry to help conserve water as a scarce resource. The inclusion of a method related to supercritical technology demonstrated its applicability to industrial processes and its relevance to green chemistry by utilising environmentally friendly supercritical fluids.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 129 - 132. A {{thermodynamically}} consistent model {{capable of}} modelling a binary alloy undergoing solidification or melting is developed. The theory is continuum based, and the solid-liquid phase change system is described macroscopically {{by a single}} set of conservation equations. The model {{is an extension of}} that presented in the literature. The thermodynamic theories of this type in the current literature are based on the assumption of local equilibrium. This assumption is not representative of most alloy solidification processes where the solid-liquid phase region, termed the mushy region, is of dendritic nature with the rates of diffusion in the liquid being orders of magnitude faster than that in the solid. The propose model includes the assumption of local non-equilibrium where solute diffusion in the solid phase is assumed to be zero. The thermodynamic formulation is expressed in terms of three thermodynamic variables: pressure, temperature and average solute concentration for both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium case. A generalized set of conservation equations of mass, energy, momentum and solute with the necessary constitutive equations is presented. A Finite Element (FE) formulation of a simplified form of the governing equations is developed. The reduced set of equations implemented in the FE formulation consists of a fully coupled heat conduction and solute diffusion formulation, with solid-liquid phase change, where the effects of pressure and convection are neglected. The FE formulation is based on the fixed grid technique where the elements are two dimensional, four noded quadrilaterals with the primary variables being enthalpy and average solute concentration. Temperature and solid mass fraction are calculated on a local level at each integration point of an element. A fully consistent Newton-Raphson method is used to solve the global coupled equations and an Euler backward difference scheme is used for the temporal discretization. The solution of the enthalpy-temperature relationship is carried out at the integration points using a Newton-Raphson method. A secant method employing the regula falsi technique takes into account sudden jumps or sharp changes in the enthalpy-temperature behaviour which occur at the phase zone interfaces. The Euler backward difference integration rule is used to calculate the solid mass fraction and its derivatives for the non-equilibrium case. Two solidification examples, using both the local equilibrium and the local non-equilibrium cases, are analyzed. The finite element results obtained for the two cases are compared, and the accuracy of the finite element model is checked. Both dendritic and eutectic phase change are tackled. Even though the discrete eutectic phase change is approximated using the fixed grid approach, the results are considered to be reasonable approximations to what occurs in reality. Favorable comparisons of the results are obtained with that in the literature and convergence of the finite element results for different mesh sizes are shown. For dilute alloy solutions, the solidification results for the local equilibrium and the local non-equilibrium cases are shown to differ markedly, whereas for near <b>eutectic</b> <b>solutions</b> little difference is observed. The use of the local non-equilibrium assumption in the finite element solidification model is shown to effect the macro-segregation of solute...|$|R

The effects are shown to be closely correlated with sintering conditions, cobalt content and WC grain size. Additionally in-situ measurement of volatile components during outgassing and sintering (evolved gas analysis by means of thermobalance-mass spectrometer coupling) allow s the characterization of relevant mechanisms (e. g. reduction of oxidic impurities of the binder and the hard material). The results yield new possibilities of optimization of temperature-time-atmosphere-profiles for the production of hard metals...|$|R
40|$|Stellite 6 {{hardfacing}} alloy with different Ta contents is successfully synthesized with an in situ process on low carbon ferritic steel substrate by Nd:YAG pulsed laser cladding with pre-placed Stellite 6 and Ta mixed powders. The effect of different amounts of Ta on the microstructure of the Stellite 6 {{hardfacing alloy}} is investigated using scanning electron microscopy, {{energy dispersive spectroscopy}} and transmission electron microscopy. With an increase in Ta content, in addition to orthorhombic Cr-rich M 7 C 3 carbides observed in the Ta-free Stellite 6 alloy in interdendritic regions, Ta-rich M 4 C 3. 04 type carbides are formed {{as well as individual}} bulky Ta-rich MC type carbides in Chromium carbide-Cobalt solid <b>solution</b> <b>eutectic</b> area Furthermore, the Co-rich dendrites become much finer. With further increase of Ta, hexagonal M 7 C 3 carbides are formed at the interface of orthorhombic ones. These microstructural changes are responsible for the improvement of the hardness of the Ta modified Stellite 6 hardfacing alloy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Deicing salts {{are applied}} {{to the surface of}} the {{concrete}} pavements to melt the ice and snow in an effort to improve the safety conditions for public travel. The solution that is produced (e. g., water-NaCl, CaCl 2, MgCl 2) can be absorbed into concrete pores. This solution alters the degree of saturation (i. e., the volume ratio of fluid in the sample as compared to the total maximum volume of fluid that the sample can hold) of concrete pavement, the freezing temperature of the solution within the concrete pores, and may result the damage. ^ First, a numerical model (one–dimensional finite difference model) is developed to describe the freeze-thaw thermal behavior of the mortar containing deicing salt solution. The model is used to predict the temperature and the heat flow for mortar specimens during cooling and heating. Phase transformations associated with the freezing/melting of water/ice or transition of the <b>eutectic</b> <b>solution</b> from liquid to solid are included in this model. The lever rule is used to calculate the quantity of solution that undergoes the phase transformation, thereby simulating the energy released/absorbed during phase transformation. During solidification, undercooling phenomenon is considered in the numerical model. Data from experiments performed using a low-temperature longitudinal guarded comparative calorimeter (LGCC) on mortar specimens is compared with results from the numerical model. Two types of experimental data are used for the comparison. First, data from mortar specimens that were fully saturated (i. e., 100 % degree of saturation) using varying concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions (0 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 23. 3 % concentrations by mass) were considered. Second, in addition to fully saturated specimens containing sodium chloride solution, partially saturated specimens (i. e., partially saturated specimens with water at degrees of saturation equal to 75 %, 85 %, 95 %, and 100 %) are also considered. ^ Next, a numerical model (two-dimensional finite-element model) is developed to describe the mechanical behavior of cementitious systems at early-ages. This development is influenced by the temperature of the surrounding environment. The effect of aggregates is assessed on maturity-based predictions of early-age flexural strength development. This method is based on the concept that the strength (or property) development is proportional to the extent of chemical reaction (i. e., hydration) that has taken place. It is commonly assumed that the extent of chemical reaction (i. e., the degree of hydration) is a unique function of the product of time and temperature. It is the hypothesis of this work that aggregates can alter the relationship between the maturity and the flexural (or tensile) strength. ^ To verify this hypothesis the effective age (i. e., the degree of hydration) derived from Arrhenius function was related to the flexural strength development of paste, mortar, and concrete specimens. A linear response was detected between the flexural strength respect to the extent of the hydration for the paste specimens, while a bi-linear response respect to the extent of the hydration was observed for both the mortar and concrete specimens. The intersection point (knee point) of this bi-linear response corresponds to the critical time at which the major fraction of the aggregates begins to fail. At the very early ages (i. e., less than the critical time), the flexural behavior of the concrete is dominated by the paste or the bond failure. At the later ages, the flexural strength is governed by aggregate failure. ^ Consequently, a thermo-mechanical model will be employed to simulate the freeze-thaw damage in cementitious systems containing salt solutions. Therefore, sufficient knowledge is acquired to better understand the damage mechanism occurring due to the phase change of salt solution absorbed in to the pores of cementitious systems. ...|$|R
