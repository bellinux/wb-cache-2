50|$|Gamma-linolenic acid or GLA (Î³-Linolenic acid), (INN and USAN <b>gamolenic</b> <b>acid)</b> is a {{fatty acid}} found {{primarily}} in vegetable oils. When acting on GLA, 5-lipoxygenase produces no leukotrienes and the conversion by the enzyme of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes is inhibited.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>gamolenic</b> <b>acid</b> provided by evening primrose oil in treating hot flushes and sweating associated with the menopause. DESIGN [...] Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study. SETTING [...] District general hospital and teaching hospital. SUBJECTS [...] 56 menopausal women suffering hot flushes {{at least three times}} a day. INTERVENTION [...] Four capsules twice a day of 500 mg evening primrose oil with 10 mg natural vitamin E or 500 mg liquid paraffin for six months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Change in the number of hot flushes or sweating episodes a month. RESULTS [...] 56 diaries were analysed, 28 from women taking <b>gamolenic</b> <b>acid</b> and 28 from those taking placebo. Only 18 women given <b>gamolenic</b> <b>acid</b> and 17 given placebo completed the trial. The mean (SE) improvement in the number of flushes in the last available treatment cycle compared with the control cycle was 1. 9 (0. 4) (P < 0. 001) for daytime flushes and 0. 7 (0. 3) (P < 0. 05) for night time flushes in women taking placebo; the corresponding values for women taking <b>gamolenic</b> <b>acid</b> were 0. 5 (0. 4) and 0. 5 (0. 3). In women taking <b>gamolenic</b> <b>acid</b> the only significant improvement was a reduction in the maximum number of night time flushes (1. 4 (0. 6); P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION [...] <b>Gamolenic</b> <b>acid</b> offers no benefit over placebo in treating menopausal flushing...|$|E
40|$|In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, {{parallel}} group, multicenter study, 555 {{women with}} {{moderate to severe}} mastalgia were randomized {{to one of the}} four treatment groups to receive (a) <b>gamolenic</b> <b>acid</b> (GLA) and antioxidants, (b) placebo fatty acids and antioxidants, (c) GLA and placebo antioxidants, or (d) placebo fatty acids and placebo antioxidants, for four menstrual cycles. This was followed by a further eight menstrual cycles of open treatment in which all patients received GLA, but continued to be randomized to active or placebo antioxidants as in the preceding parallel phase. Diary pain cards and linear analog charts were used for assessment of response. A reduction in breast pain was seen in all four treatment groups during the blinded treatment phase. There was a substantial improvement in the placebo fatty acids groups (response rate of 40 %), and {{there were no significant differences}} among the four treatment groups. During the open treatment phase, a further reduction in breast pain was seen in all groups, with no statistically significant differences between groups. This study showed that GLA (Efamast) efficacy did not differ from that of placebo fatty acids, regardless of whether or not antioxidant vitamins were present...|$|E
