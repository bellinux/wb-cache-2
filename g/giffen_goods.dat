One reason for the difficulty in studying market demand for <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods</b> that is Giffen originally envisioned a specific situation faced by individuals in poverty. Modern consumer behaviour research methods often deal in aggregates that average out income levels, and are too blunt an instrument to capture these specific situations.

For this reason, many text books use the term Giffen paradox rather than Giffen good.|$|E
25|$|<b>Giffen</b> <b>goods</b> {{are named}} after Scottish {{economist}} Sir Robert Giffen, to whom Alfred Marshall attributed this idea {{in his book}} Principles of Economics. Giffen first proposed the paradox from his observations of the purchasing habits of the Victorian era poor.|$|E
25|$|It is aforementioned, {{that the}} demand curve is {{generally}} downward-sloping, {{there may be}} rare examples of goods that have upward-sloping demand curves. Two different hypothetical types of goods with upward-sloping demand curves are <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods</b> (an inferior but staple good) and Veblen goods (goods made more fashionable by a higher price).|$|E
50|$|In human {{economics}} and consumer theory, a <b>Giffen</b> <b>good</b> is a resource which is paradoxically consumed {{more as the}} cost rises, violating the law of demand. In normal situations, {{as the price of}} a resource increases, the substitution effect causes consumers to purchase less of it and more of substitute <b>goods.</b> In the <b>Giffen</b> <b>good</b> situation, the income effect dominates, leading people to buy more of the good, even as its price rises.|$|R
5000|$|A special type of {{inferior}} good {{may exist}} {{known as the}} <b>Giffen</b> <b>good,</b> which would disobey the [...] "law of demand". Quite simply, {{when the price of}} a <b>Giffen</b> <b>good</b> increases, the demand for that good increases. This {{would have to be a}} good that is such a large proportion of a person or market's consumption that the income effect of a price increase would produce, effectively, more demand. The observed demand curve would slope upward, indicating positive elasticity.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>Giffen</b> <b>good</b> is named after him. Alfred Marshall wrote in the third (1895) edition of his Principles of Economics: ...|$|R
25|$|Another 2008 {{paper by}} the same authors {{experimentally}} demonstrated the existence of <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods</b> among people at the household level by directly subsidizing purchases of rice and wheat flour for extremely poor families. It is easier to find Giffen effects where the number of goods available is limited, as in an experimental economy: DeGrandpre et al. (1993) provide such an experimental demonstration. In 1991, Battalio, Kagel, and Kogut proved that quinine water is a Giffen good for some lab rats. However, they were only able to show {{the existence of a}} Giffen good at an individual level and not the market level.|$|E
500|$|The above formula usually {{yields a}} {{negative}} value, {{due to the}} inverse {{nature of the relationship}} between price and quantity demanded, as described by the [...] "law of demand". For example, if the price increases by 5% and quantity demanded decreases by 5%, then the elasticity at the initial price and quantity = −5%/5% = −1. The only classes of goods which have a PED of greater than 0 are Veblen and <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods.</b> Although the PED is negative {{for the vast majority of}} goods and services, economists often refer to price elasticity of demand as a positive value (i.e., in absolute value terms).|$|E
500|$|Price elasticities {{are almost}} always negative, {{although}} analysts tend to ignore the sign even though {{this can lead to}} ambiguity. Only goods which do not conform to the law of demand, such as Veblen and <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods,</b> have a positive PED. In general, the demand for a good is said to be inelastic (or relatively inelastic) when the PED is less than one (in absolute value): that is, changes in price have a relatively small effect on the quantity of the good demanded. The demand for a good is said to be elastic (or relatively elastic) when its PED is greater than one (in absolute value): that is, changes in price have a relatively large effect on the quantity of a good demanded. Demand for a good is: ...|$|E
25|$|Anthony Bopp (1983) {{proposed}} that kerosene, a low-quality fuel used in home heating, was a <b>Giffen</b> <b>good.</b> Schmuel Baruch and Yakar Kanai (2001) suggested that shochu, a Japanese distilled beverage, {{might be a}} <b>Giffen</b> <b>good.</b> In both cases, the authors offered supporting econometric evidence. However, the empirical evidence has been generally considered incomplete. In a 2005 article, Sasha Abramsky of The Nation conjectured that gasoline, in certain circumstances, may act as a <b>Giffen</b> <b>good.</b> However, no supporting evidence was offered, and evidence from the large increases in oil prices in 2008 would suggest that quantity demanded for gasoline did actually fall {{as a result of}} increased prices. Of course, the lack of evidence at the aggregate level does not rule out that the proposed goods may have been Giffen for certain groups of consumers—in particular for poor consumers.|$|R
5000|$|An {{ordinary}} good is a microeconomic concept used {{in consumer}} theory. It {{is defined as}} a good which creates increased demand when the price for the good drops or conversely decreased demand if the price for the good increases, ceteris paribus. It is the opposite of a <b>Giffen</b> <b>good.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{economics}} and consumer theory, a <b>Giffen</b> <b>good</b> {{is a product}} that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa—violating the basic law of demand in microeconomics. For any other sort of good, {{as the price of}} the good rises, the substitution effect makes consumers purchase less of it, and more of substitute goods; for most goods, the income effect (due to the effective decline in available income due to more being spent on existing units of this good) reinforces this decline in demand for the <b>good.</b> But a <b>Giffen</b> <b>good</b> is so strongly an inferior good in the minds of consumers (being more in demand at lower incomes) that this contrary income effect more than offsets the substitution effect, and the net effect of the good's price rise is to increase demand for it.|$|R
2500|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods</b> has generally been limited. A 2008 paper by Robert Jensen and Nolan Miller made the claim that rice and wheat/noodles are <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods</b> in parts of China by tracking prices of goods., but it is probably a mistake to cite noodles as a sort of Giffen good, as the term is usually used by modern economists to refer to goods that are so specialized and rare that they aren't used for food consumption.|$|E
2500|$|In other words, {{price and}} {{quantity}} demanded pull in opposite directions; if price goes up, then quantity demanded generally goes down. <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods</b> are {{an exception to}} this general rule. Unlike other goods or services, the price point at which supply and demand meet results in higher prices and greater demand whenever market forces recognize a change in supply and demand for <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods.</b> As a result, when price goes up, the quantity demanded also goes up. To be a true Giffen good, the good's price must {{be the only thing}} that changes to produce a change in quantity demanded. A Giffen good {{should not be confused with}} products bought as status symbols or for conspicuous consumption (Veblen goods), although there may be some overlap as consumers are more likely to engage in conspicuous consumption as a way to engage in [...] "aspirational spending" [...] as a way to increase their social status.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{types of}} premium goods (such as {{expensive}} French wines, or celebrity-endorsed perfumes) are sometimes called Giffen goods—via {{the claim that}} lowering the price of these high status goods decreases demand because {{they are no longer}} perceived as exclusive or high status products. However, {{to the extent that the}} perceived nature of such high status goods actually changes significantly with a substantial price drop, this behavior disqualifies them from being considered <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods,</b> because the <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods</b> analysis assumes that only the consumer's income or the relative price level changes, not the nature of the good itself. If a price change modifies consumers' perception of the good, they should be analysed as Veblen goods. Some economists question the empirical validity of the distinction between Giffen and Veblen goods, arguing that whenever there is a substantial change in the price of a good its perceived nature also changes, since price is a large part of what constitutes a product. [...] However the theoretical distinction between the two types of analysis remains clear, which one should apply to any actual case is an empirical matter.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by Etsusuke Masuda and Peter Newman that Simon Gray described [...] "Gray goods" [...] in his 1815 text entitled The Happiness of States: Or An Inquiry Concerning Population, The Modes of Subsisting and Employing It, and the Effects of All on Human Happiness.

50|$|The {{interaction}} effects {{are a different}} kind of anomaly from that posed by <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods.</b> The <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods</b> theory is one for which observed demand rises as price rises, but the effect arises without any interaction between price and preference—it results from the interplay of the income effect and the substitution effect of a change in price.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{existence}} of <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods</b> {{outside the realm of}} economic theory is still contested, the pairing of <b>Giffen</b> <b>goods</b> with ordinary goods has gotten less traction in economics textbooks than the pairing normal good/inferior good used to distinguish responses to income changes. The usage of [...] "ordinary good" [...] is still useful since it allows a simple representation of price and income changes. A normal good is always ordinary, while an ordinary good can be normal, inferior or sticky.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the optimal insurance problem when the insurer has a loss limit constraint. Under the assumptions that the insurance price depends only on the policy's actuarial value, and the insured seeks to maximize the expected utility of his terminal wealth, we show that coverage above a deductible up to a cap is the optimal contract, and the relaxation of insurer's loss limit will increase the insured's expected utility. When the insurance price is given by the expected value principle, we show that a positive loading factor is a sufficient and necessary condition for the deductible to be positive. Moreover, with the expected value principle, we show that the optimal deductible derived in our model is not greater (lower) than that derived in Arrow's model if the insured's preference displays increasing (decreasing) absolute risk aversion. Therefore, when the insured has an IARA (DARA) utility function, compared to Arrow model, the insurance policy derived in our model provides more (less) coverage for small losses, and less coverage for large losses. Furthermore, we prove that the optimal insurance derived in our model is an inferior (normal) good for the insured with a DARA (IARA) utility function, consistent with the finding in the previous literature. Being inferior, the insurance {{can also be a}} <b>Giffen</b> <b>good.</b> Under the assumption that the insured's initial wealth is greater than a certain level, we show that the insurance is not a <b>Giffen</b> <b>good</b> if the coefficient of the insured's relative risk aversion is lower than 1.

2500|$|A price drop for {{commodity}} X causes two effects. The {{reduced price}} alters relative prices {{in favour of}} commodity X, known as the substitution effect. This is illustrated by a movement down the indifference curve from point A to point B (a pivot of the budget constraint about the original indifference curve). At the same time, the price reduction increases consumer purchasing power, known as the income effect (an outward shift of the budget constraint). This {{is illustrated by the}} shifting out of the dotted line to MP (where P = income divided by the new price of commodity X). The substitution effect (point A to point B) raises the quantity demanded of commodity X from Xa to Xb while the income effect lowers the quantity demanded from Xb to Xc. The net effect is a reduction in quantity demanded from Xa to Xc making commodity X a <b>Giffen</b> <b>good</b> by definition. Any good where the income effect more than compensates for the substitution effect is a [...] <b>Giffen</b> <b>good.</b>|$|R
50|$|However, with Veblen goods, such as status symbols, {{the utility}} {{value of the}} good is largely the price and demand is higher at higher prices and the demand curve may curve upwards. With a <b>Giffen</b> <b>good</b> the price is taken by the market as a signal of quality, {{irrespective}} of {{the true nature of}} the product, and hence demand may be very low when priced low and increase at higher price points.|$|R
