25|$|In Europe, {{most notably}} in Belgium, NTA laws have been enacted and created {{parallel}} institutions and political parties in the same country. In Belgium, NTA has been integrated within the federal consociational system. Some scholars of ethnic conflict resolution claim {{that the practice of}} NTA will be employed dependent on the concentration and size of the ethnic group asking for <b>group</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E
25|$|Drawing {{on ideas}} of Adam Smith, {{classical}} liberals {{believed that it}} is in the common interest that all individuals be able to secure their own economic self-interest. They were critical of what would come to be the idea of the welfare state as interfering in a free market. Despite Smith’s resolute recognition of the importance and value of labor and of laborers, they selectively criticized labour's <b>group</b> <b>rights</b> being pursued at the expense of individual rights while accepting corporations' rights, which led to inequality of bargaining power.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{theory of}} ethnic tension {{resolution}} is non-territorial autonomy or NTA. NTA {{has emerged in}} recent years as an alternative solution to ethnic tensions and grievances in places that are likely to breed conflict. For this reason, NTA has been promoted as a more practical and state building solution than consociationalism. NTA, alternatively known as non-cultural autonomy (NCA), is based on the difference of jus solis and jus sanguinis, the principles of territory versus that of personhood. It gives rights to ethnic groups to self-rule and govern matters potentially concerning but limited to: education, language, culture, internal affairs, religion, and the internally established institutions needed to promote and reproduce these facets. In contrast to federalism, the ethnic groups are not assigned a titular sub-state, but rather the ethnic groups are dispersed throughout the state unit. Their <b>group</b> <b>rights</b> and autonomy are not constrained to a particular territory within the state. This is done in order not to weaken the center state such {{as in the case of}} ethnofederalism.|$|E

2500|$|In The Rights Revolution, Ignatieff {{identifies}} {{three aspects}} of Canada's approach {{to human rights}} that give the country its distinctive culture: 1) On moral issues, Canadian law is secular and liberal, approximating European standards more closely than American ones; 2) Canadian political culture is social democratic, and Canadians {{take it for granted}} that citizens have the right to free health care and public assistance; 3) Canadians place a particular emphasis on <b>group</b> <b>rights,</b> expressed in Quebec's language laws and in treaty agreements that recognize collective aboriginal rights. [...] "Apart from New Zealand, no other country has given such recognition to the idea of group rights," [...] he writes.|$|E
2500|$|While the Charter {{has enjoyed}} {{a great deal of}} popularity, with 82% of Canadians {{describing}} it as a good thing in opinion polls in 1987 and 1999, the document has also been subject to published criticisms {{from both sides of the}} political spectrum. One left-wing critic is Professor Michael Mandel, who wrote that in comparison to politicians, judges do not have to be as sensitive to the will of the electorate, nor do they have to make sure their decisions are easily understandable to the average Canadian citizen. This, in Mandel's view, limits democracy. Mandel has also asserted that the Charter makes Canada more like the United States, especially by serving corporate rights and individual rights rather than <b>group</b> <b>rights</b> and social rights. He has argued that there are several things that should be included in the Charter, such as a right to health care and a basic right to free education. Hence, the perceived Americanization of Canadian politics is seen as coming at the expense of values more important for Canadians. The union movement has been disappointed in the reluctance of the courts to use the Charter to support various forms of union activity, such as the [...] "right to strike".|$|E

2500|$|The {{resistance}} to his application {{was a surprise}} for Șăineanu, who wrote: [...] "I was not aware that this path [...] is the more thorny as the [...] merits are more real." [...] He also accused the political establishment of endemic corruption, writing: [...] "any banker who demanded naturalization received it without the least of difficulties". During the following interval, Șăineanu's cause reportedly won the support of King Carol I, Conservative Premier Lascăr Catargiu and moderate National Liberal politico Mihail Kogălniceanu. Reviewing the situation, Șăineanu cited an unusual incident in neighboring Austria–Hungary, where local Romanians were demanding increased <b>group</b> <b>rights</b> {{as part of the}} Memorandum movement. Their arguments about cultural repression were met with the reply of Hungarian intellectuals, who cited the Șăineanu issue as proof that Austria–Hungary had more to offer than Romania: [...] "He had all of Romania on his case, but he had rendered [...] as many services as most Romanian demigods." [...] In 1893, the naturalization request came before the lower chamber, resulting in a vote of 76 in favor to 20 against. According to the scholar's recollections, his only adversary in this forum was his former Convorbiri Literare colleague, writer Iacob Negruzzi, who reportedly stated the unsupported claim that Șăineanu had campaigned against Romania [...] "in English" [...] (Șăineanu believed that this was [...] "doubtlessly" [...] stated [...] "because [...] was completely unfamiliar to the majority of Chamber members").|$|E
