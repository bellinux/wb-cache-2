40|$|A {{technique}} called micro rollback, which allows {{most of the}} performance penalty for concurrent error detection to be eliminated, is presented. Detection is performed in parallel with the transmission of information between modules, thus removing the delay for detection from the critical path. Erroneous information may thus reach its <b>destination</b> <b>module</b> several clock cycles before an error indication. Operations performed on this erroneous information are undone using a hardware mechanism for fast rollback of a few cycles. The implementation of a VLSI processor capable of micro rollback is discussed, {{as well as several}} critical issues related to its use in a complete system...|$|E
30|$|The {{interaction}} between the RANEs {{and the rest of}} the AROMA testbed is accomplished through two different planes: a control plane and a data plane. The control plane supports all of the functionalities needed for exchanging control messages between the RANEs and other modules, concretely the CRRM and TG machines. To this end, the CM abstraction layer provides the logical concept of flow. During the initialization phase of the testbed, the modules create a flow with all of the modules to/from which control messages need to be sent/received. Thereafter, modules can write control packets in the flow addressed to the <b>destination</b> <b>module.</b> This message exchanging process is managed by the CM in a completely transparent way.

40|$|Concurrent error {{detection}} and confinement requires checking the outputs of every module {{in the system}} during every clock cycle. This is usually accomplished by checkers and isolation circuits in the communication paths from each module {{to the rest of}} the system. This additional circuitry reduces system performance. We present a technique, called micro rollback, which allows most of the performance penalty for concurrent {{error detection}} to be eliminated. Detection is performed in parallel with the transmission of information between modules, thus removing the delay for detection from the critical path. Erroneous information may thus reach its <b>destination</b> <b>module</b> several clock cycles before an error indication. Operations performed on this erroneous information are "undone" using a hardware mechanism for fast rollback of a few cycles. We discuss the implementation of a VLSI processor capable of micro rollback as well as several critical issues related to its use in a complete system...|$|E
40|$|The data {{acquisition}} system of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment must run at the very high trigger rates expected at the LHC. A 512 x 512 data switch with an aggregate bandwidth of 500 Gb/s is planned as {{the core of the}} event builder, which will feed events in at least two stages to the computing farm running the post level- 1 triggers in software. Currently small scale hardware setups are built to test various hardware architectures. In order to see how the test bed results apply to the full scale system simulation activities have started.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new common-bus architecture for high-speed data transfer with transferring {{vast quantities of}} data between modules inside a VLSI chip. In the intrachip data transfer, start addresses of the source and <b>destination</b> <b>modules</b> {{and the number of}} data are sent to the target modules at the first step, which is called “address presetting”. After that, only the data are transferred with the maximum width of the bus, which results in achieving high throughput of bus communication. Moreover, the use of multiple-valued data encoding together with a multiplevalued current-mode circuit technique for multi-level signal detectors makes it possible to perform higher throughput of data transfer under the bus-width constraint. In case of a 64 -line bus, it is demonstrated that the peak throughput using the proposed architecture is 8 times higher than that using a binary bus architecture based on direct memory access control. Its power dissipation is reduced to about 20 percent in comparison with that of the direct memory access one under the normalized throughput in a 0. 18 µm CMOS process. ...|$|R

3000|$|Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) [28] is {{designed}} for handling routing issues in the highway environment. In a highly dense scenario, it performs well. It has two modules that are greedy module and perimeter module. In the greedy module, a vehicular node forwards the packet to one of its one-hop neighbors that is the closest among its one-hop neighbors and itself to the <b>destination.</b> The greedy <b>module</b> meets the local maximum if the packet carrier node has no one-hop neighbor that {{is close to the}} destination than itself. [...] Perimeter module is used to handle the local maximum situation. The perimeter module includes two mechanisms, the graph planarization, and the right hand rule. The perimeter module induces long delays in dispatching packets from the source to the target. It also creates routing loops in the network, and unaware of obstacles [37], which makes it difficult to work in city scenarios. Furthermore, the graph planarization partitions the network in the city scenarios due to obstacles and degrades its performance further [11, 12].|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Road traffic {{congestion}} {{is a major}} issue in most mega cities. The traffic jams are often exacerbated by drivers habitually following the same routes. A real-time, optimum vehicle routing system that takes traffic density into account can be a possible solution to this problem. This paper presents RouteFinder, a system of providing real-time traffic density mapping on the driver’s smartphone using an in-vehicle module built using inexpensive components that communicates with the existing mobile telephone network, to enable the driver to choose the least congested route to a desired <b>destination.</b> The hardware <b>module</b> contains the essential elements of a cellular handset such as a SIM card. The location of the vehicle is determined through a standard triangulation algorithm performed using signals from the three nearest cellular base stations, and the location information is constantly updated at relevant Home Location Registers (HLRs) / Visitor Location Register (VLRs) at the telecom service provider using an intermediate MySQL database. An Android application developed for the driver’s smartphone shows the present locations of all vehicles in all routes from the origin to the selected destination, with colour codes distinguishing between moving and stationary vehicles.

40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Automatic Car Navigation System {{gives us}} {{knowledge}} about the vehicle moving system. It mainly, gives us information how DC motor is controlled, and how it behaves when connected with H-bridge. H-bridge is interfaced with both DC motor and microcontroller and the operation of vehicle depends on the programming of microcontroller. For microcontroller we selected evaluation board which supports our microcontroller (ATmega 328). The H-bridge selected for interfacing was L 293 D which is Quadruple Half H-Driver. When interfaced with GPS, the car moves in the given direction. The initial location and the destination location were defined in the GPS module. The main aim was to drive the car from the initial location to final <b>destination.</b> The GPS <b>module</b> selected for this purpose was EM- 408 from US GlobalSat Incorporation. 	Also we implemented Kalman Filter Algorithm, to cancel out the noise and errors in the GPS signal. While retrieving the GPS signal, it is effected by noise and certain errors, and this algorithm helps us out to cancel this effect. It uses mathematical equations in which initial vector and state estimate are defined. After doing the initial assignments, we obtain observation and control vector and by using Kalman filter we get the updated state estimate. This value that we receive is taken into account and microcontroller takes this value and gives direction to the vehicle according to that. Electrical and Electronic Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|El pdf del artículo es la versión post-print. This paper {{presents}} a modular, scalable approach to assembling hierarchically structured neuromorphic Address Event Representation (AER) systems. The method consists of arranging modules in a 2 D mesh, each communicating bidirectionally with all four neighbors. Address events include a module label. Each module includes an AER router which decides how to route address events. Two routing approaches have been proposed, analyzed and tested, using either <b>destination</b> or source <b>module</b> labels. Our analyses reveal that depending on traffic conditions and network topologies either {{one or the}} other approach may result in better performance. Experimental results are given after testing the approach using high-end Virtex- 6 FPGAs. The approach is proposed for both single and multiple FPGAs, in which case a special bidirectional parallel-serial AER link with flow control is exploited, using the FPGA Rocket-I/O interfaces. Extensive test results are provided exploiting convolution modules of 64 × 64 pixels with kernels with sizes up to 11 × 11, which process real sensory data from a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) retina. One single Virtex- 6 FPGA can hold up to 64 of these convolution modules, which is equivalent to a neural network with 262 × 103 neurons and almost 32 million synapses.
