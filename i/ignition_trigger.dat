Theoretical calculations show that in such a fuel, a high plasma temperature about 100 keV is a requisite for reaction rate improvement of nuclear fusion.

This paper examines the change in the cycle-to-cycle coupling around different operating points in recompression HCCI and show that there are three qualitative types of temperature dynamics: smooth decaying when combustion phasing is early, oscillatory when phasing is late, and strongly converging with moderate combustion phasing. As a result, a three region switching linear model that combines three linearized models can capture the qualitative change in system characteristics. Based on this model, a three region switching controller is designed and shown in experiments that it can track a wide range of desired combustion phasing and improve the variance of combustion phasing over open-loop operations. In the last part of this paper, two semi-definite programming (SDP) formulations are presented to prove the stability of the switching control/model framework. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the follow up of a {{previous}} work and its target is {{to demonstrate that the}} best fuel for a Compression Ignition engine has to be with high Octane Number. An advanced injection strategy was designed in order to run Gasoline in a CI engine. At high load it consisted in injecting 54 % of the fuel very early in the pilot and the remaining around TDC; the second injection is used as <b>ignition</b> <b>trigger</b> and an appropriate amount of cool EGR has to be used in order to avoid pre-ignition of the pilot. Substantially lower NOx, soot and specific fuel consumption were achieved at 16. 56 bar gross IMEP as compared to Diesel. The pressure rise rate did not constitute any problem thanks to the stratification created by the main injection and a partial overlap between start of the combustion and main injection. Ethanol gave excellent results too; with this fuel the maximum load was limited at 14. 80 bar gross IMEP because of hardware issues. Applying the commonly used PPC injection strategies to Gasoline resulted in higher pressure oscillations after combustion and the heat transfer was enhanced. It was shown that this problem can be somehow solved by employing a late pilot injection, unfortunately the combustion is diffusion controlled and there is an increase in fuel consumption as compared to the strategy previously described. The viability of having low fuel consumption, NOx, soot and pressure rise rate using high ON fuels in a CI engine was demonstrated using a Scania single cylinder truck engine with 2 liters displacement volume running at 1100 rpm...|$|E
40|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) engines {{have the benefit}} of high efficiency with low emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulates. These benefits are due to the autoignition process of the dilute mixture of fuel and air during compression. However, because there is no direct <b>ignition</b> <b>trigger,</b> control of ignition is inherently more difficult than in standard internal combustion engines. This difficulty necessitates that a feedback controller be used to keep the engine at a desired (efficient) setpoint in the face of disturbances. Because of the nonlinear autoignition process, the sensitivity of ignition changes with the operating point. Thus, gain scheduling is required to cover the entire operating range of the engine. Controller tuning can therefore be a time intensive process. With the goal of reducing the time to tune the controller, we use extremum seeking (ES) to tune the parameters of various forms of combustion timing controllers. Additionally, in this dissertation we demonstrate how ES can be used for the determination of an optimal combustion timing setpoint of an experimental HCCI engine. The use of ES has the benefit of achieving both optimal setpoint (for maximizing the engine efficiency) and controller parameter tuning tasks quickly. The lack of a direct combustion trigger makes control of combustion timing during transients especially challenging. To aid in HCCI engine control during transients, we have developed a model {{that can be used to}} derive a controller for a thermally-managed, gasoline and natural gas fueled HCCI engine. The model uses an ignition threshold derived from detailed chemical kinetic simulations of HCCI engine combustion to provide an estimate for the combustion timing. The ignition threshold is a function of both temperature and pressure. An estimate of the residual gas fraction from the previous cycle can also be obtained, which is essential information due to the strong temperature sensitivity of HCCI ignition. This model allows the synthesis of nonlinear control laws, which can be utilized for control of an HCCI engine during transient...|$|E
40|$|Combined {{experimental}} and numerical {{studies of the}} transient response of ignition to strained flows require a well-characterized <b>ignition</b> <b>trigger.</b> Laser deposition of a small radical pool provides a reliable method for initiating ignition Of Mixtures that are near the ignition limit. Two-dimensional direct numerical simulations are used to quantify the sensitivity of ignition kernel formation and subsequent edge-flame propagation to the oxidizer temperature and the initial width and amplitude of O-atom deposition used to trigger ignition in an axisymmetric counterflow of heated air versus ambient hydrogen/nitrogen. The ignition delay and super-equilibrium OH concentration in the nascent ignition kernel are highly sensitive to variations in these initial conditions. The ignition delay decreases as the amplitude of the initial O-atom deposition increases. The spatial distribution and {{the magnitude of the}} OH overshoot are governed by multi-dimensional effects. The degree of OH overshoot near the burner centerline increases as the diameter of the initial O-atom deposition region decreases. This result is attributed to preferential diffusion of hydrogen in the highly curved leading portion of the edge flame that is established following thermal runaway. The edge-flame speed and OH overshoot at {{the leading edge of the}} edge flame are relatively insensitive to variations in the initial conditions of the ignition. The steady edge-flame speed is approximately twice the corresponding laminar flame speed. The rate at which the edge flame approaches its steady state is insensitive to the initial conditions and depends solely on the diffusion time scale at the edge flame. The edge flame is curved toward the heated oxidizer stream as a result of differences in the chemical kinetics between the leading edge and the trailing diffusion flame. The structure of the highly diluted diffusion flame considered in this study corresponds to Linan's 'premixed flame regime' in which only the oxidizer leaks through the reaction zone such that the flame is located at fuel lean rather than stoichiometric mixture fraction conditions. close 9...|$|E

Fire retarded foam and non-fire retarded foam were selected to study the phenomena of smoldering combustion. Foam length and ignition power {{were found to have}} key effects on the smolder initiation. Fire retardants with phosphorus and bromine showed positive and negative influence on restricting the smolder initiation under different <b>ignition</b> powers. <b>Triggering</b> of the transition from smoldering to flaming was revealed to significantly depend on exothermic oxidation of the residual char and the availability of oxygen inside the foam layer. Effects of foam length, ignition power, moisture content and fire retardants in the foam on the transition were also explored. Propagation of horizontally oriented forced forward smoldering was found to be controlled not only by oxygen supply rate to the reaction zone but also by the heat loss to the surroundings. It was found that the smoldering propagation rate firstly increases with air flow rate and decreases after reaching a maximum at the air flow rate of around 0. 8 m/s. Through asymptotic analysis, it was shown that for the adiabatic case, the smoldering propagation rate and smoldering temperature increase with the air flow rate. Furthermore, they are larger than the corresponding values under the stoichiometric condition. Analysis also showed that the density and porosity of the foam, ambient oxygen concentration and mass transfer coefficient have effects on the smoldering propagation rate.

The spike is tailored to produce an inward shock that reaches the rebouncing one coming from the centre causing the additional heating and fuel compression needed to ignite. The continuous shock launching as well as the shell implosion are a natural place where both hydrodynamic ablative Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) and ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) are seeded and grow [3, 4]. Hydrodynamic instabilities quickly degenerate, e. g. hot-cold material mixing, causing fuel degradation and so aborting ignition. Our numerical investigation begins assuming that the outer target surface is corrugated. Simulations are carried out with the 2 D radiative hydrodynamic code DUED. Our studies show that during the first phase of the ramped profile surface, the perturbations below a given threshold are damped by vorticity, above the RMI is excited [3]. Most importantly the RTI develops {{toward the end of the}} pulse, when the shell takes up moving, and its initial amplitude conditions are given by the late phase of the RMI. The two instabilities are sequential (one follows and seeds the other) and thus they are strictly correlated. We deduce that instability control can be traced back up to the original surface manufacturing perturbations. For this reason we have investigated techniques such as an ‘adiabat shaping picket’, giving promising results. Simulations verify that RMI and RTI behave similarly if we impose shell density inhomogeneity [3] or whether we consider target positioning error [4, 5]. Non-local electron transport effects [6, 7] are also included, they become important in ablative regions to reproduce all the thermal flow features.

The timestep is updated dynamically during the simulation through a three-stage multitimescale modeling strategy, which takes advantage of the large separation of timescales in nanosecond pulsed plasma discharges. A general theory of plasma assisted ignition and combustion is then proposed. Nanosecond pulsed plasma discharges for ignition and combustion can be divided into four stages. Stage I is the discharge pulse, with timescales of O(1 to 10 ns). In this stage, most input energy is coupled into electron impact excitation and dissociation reactions to generate charged or excited species and radicals. Stage II is the afterglow during the gap between two adjacent pulses, with timescales of O(100 ns). In this stage, quenching of excited species not only further dissociates O 2 and fuel molecules, but also provides fast gas heating. Stage III is the remaining gap between pulses, with timescales of O(1 to 100 microsec). The radicals generated during Stages I and II significantly enhance the exothermic reactions in this stage. Stage IV is the accumulative effects of multiple pulses, with timescales of O(1 ms to 1 sec), which include preheated gas temperatures and a large pool of radicals and fuel fragments to <b>trigger</b> <b>ignition.</b> For plasma assisted flames, plasma significantly enhances the radical generation and gas heating in the preheat zone, which could trigger upstream autoignition.

40|$|Neutron stars, {{with their}} strong surface gravity, have {{interestingly}} short timescales for the sedimentation of heavy elements. Motivated by observations of Type I X-ray bursts from sources with extremely low persistent accretion luminosities, L_X < 10 ^ 36 (≃ 0. 01 L_Edd), we study how sedimentation affects {{the distribution of}} isotopes and the ignition of H and He in the envelope of an accreting neutron star. For local mass accretion rates ≲ 10 ^- 2 (for which the ignition of H is unstable), where = 8. 8 × 10 ^ 4, the helium and CNO elements sediment out of the accreted fuel before reaching a temperature where H would ignite. Using one-zone calculations of the thermonuclear burning, we find a range of accretion rates for which the unstable H <b>ignition</b> does not <b>trigger</b> unstable He burning. This range depends on the emergent flux from reactions in the deep neutron star crust; for F = 0. 1 (ṁ/), the range is 3 × 10 ^- 3 ≲≲ 10 ^- 2. We speculate that sources accreting in this range will build up a massive He layer that later produces an energetic and long X-ray burst. At mass accretion rates lower than this range, {{we find that the}} H flash leads to a strong mixed H/He flash. Surprisingly, even at accretion rates ≳ 0. 1, although the H and He do not completely segregate, the H abundance {{at the base of the}} accumulated layer is still reduced. While following the evolution of the X-ray burst is beyond the scope of this introductory paper, we note that the reduced proton-to-seed ratio favors the production of 12 C [...] an important ingredient for subsequent superbursts.
