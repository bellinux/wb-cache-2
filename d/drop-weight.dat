50|$|The Figure of Insensitivity is {{determined}} from impact testing, typically using a <b>drop-weight</b> tower. In this test, {{a small sample}} of the explosive is placed on a small steel anvil which is slotted into a recess in the base of the drop tower. A cylindrical, 1 kilogram steel weight (mounted inside a tube to accurately guide its descent to the impact point in the centre of the anvil) is then dropped onto the test specimen from a measured height. The specimen is monitored both during and after this process to determine whether initiation occurs. This test is repeated many times, varying the drop height according to a prescribed method. Various heights are used, starting with a small distance (e.g. 10 cm) and then progressively increasing it to as high as 3 metres. The series of drop heights and whether initiation occurred are analysed statistically to determine the drop height which has a 50% likelihood of initiating the explosives. The intention of these tests is to develop safety policies/rules which will govern the design, manufacturing, handling and storage of the explosive and any munitions containing it.|$|E

40|$|According to the {{principle}} and method of <b>drop-weight</b> impact test, the impact resistance of concrete was measured using self-designed U-shape specimens and a newly designed <b>drop-weight</b> impact test apparatus. A series of <b>drop-weight</b> impact tests were carried out with four different masses of drop hammers (0. 875, 0. 8, 0. 675 and 0. 5 kg).

It is also easy to record the cracks propagation during the test. The maximum of coefficient of variation in this study is 31. 2 %; it is lower than the values obtained from the American Concrete Institute (ACI) impact tests in the literature. By regression analysis, the linear relationship between the first-crack and ultimate failure impact resistance is good.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} the effects of tow-drop gaps in Variable Stiffness Panels under <b>drop-weight</b> impact events. Two different configurations, with and without ply-staggering, have been manufactured by Automated Fiber Placement and compared with their baseline counterpart without defects. For the study of damage resistance, three levels of low velocity impact energy are generated with a <b>drop-weight</b> tower. The damage area is analyzed by means of ultrasonic inspection. Results indicate that the influence of gap defects is only relevant under small impact energy values. However, in the case of damage tolerance, the residual compressive strength after impact does not present significant differences to that of conventional straight fiber laminates. This indicates that the strength reduction is driven mainly by the damage caused by the impact event rather than by the influence of manufacturing-induced defects. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThree-point bending {{tests on}} notched beams of a {{high-strength}} concrete {{have been conducted}} using both a servo-hydraulic machine and a self-designed <b>drop-weight</b> impact device. The fracture energy and the peak load were measured {{over a wide range}} of loading point displacement rates, spanning eight orders of magnitude. Under low displacement rates, from 10 mm/s to 10 mm/s, the tests were performed with the servo-hydraulic machine; from 10 mm/s to 10 mm/s we used the <b>drop-weight</b> impact machine. The results show that the fracture energy and the peak load increase as the loading rate increases. Nevertheless, such a trend is relatively slight under low rates and can be attributed to viscous effects mainly originating from the presence of water in the pore structure. Under high rates the increases in the fracture energy and in the peak load are dramatic due to the effect of inertia...|$|E
40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} 3 -D dynamic nonlinear finite element approach was adopted to study composite beams subject to <b>drop-weight</b> or ballistic impact. The composite specimens, made of S 2 glass-reinforced toughened epoxy (44 % fiber volume fraction, cured at 350 °F), had 24 layers (approximately 6. 35 mm) with various stacking sequences. They were damaged by impacts using either an Instron-Dynatup 8520 instrumented <b>drop-weight</b> impact tester (low-velocity impact) or an in-house high-speed gas gun (ballistic impact). For {{both types of}} tests, the time-histories of dynamic strains induced during impact were recorded using strain gages mounted {{on the front and}} back of the composite beam specimen. For <b>drop-weight</b> impact tests, the time history of impact force was also recorded; whereas for ballistic impact tests, only the impact velocity was calculated from the recorded change in voltage outputs, which resulted from the traversing of the impactor through two optical paths formed by two sets of diode laser-amplified photo diode pairs. The commercially available 3 -D dynamic nonlinear finite element software, LS-DYNA, incorporated with a proposed nonlinear anisotropic damage model, was then used to simulate the experimental results. Good agreement between experimental and FEM results can be seen from comparisons of dynamic strain and impact force histories and damage patterns. Once the proposed nonlinear anisotropic damage model was verified by experimental results, further finite element simulations were conducted to predict the ballistic limit velocity (V 50) for penetration prevention...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{determine}} the impact resistance of lightweight aggregate concrete (LWC), especially the effect of steel fibers on impact resistance of LWC, a series of <b>drop-weight</b> tests, recommended by the ACI committee 544, have been carried out in the present study. Impact and flexural tests were carried out on lightweight aggregate concrete reinforced with five different percentages of steel fibers 0. 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 5 % and 2. 0 % by volume of concrete. For each volume of fibers, complete load–deflection curves of SFLWC were generated in {{order to determine}} the total energy absorbed for each specimen. The addition of steel fibers to concrete has improved impact resistance and also the flexural toughness.
