40|$|In total, 26 natural {{compounds}} of various chemical classes (flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids) and 19 crude extracts from selected plants {{were tested in}} vitro for antibacterial activity against three strains of P. larvae, the causal agent <b>of</b> American <b>Foulbrood</b> Disease <b>of</b> honey <b>bees</b> (AFB) by the broth microdilution method. Among the individual substances, sanguinarine (MIC 4 μg/ml), followed by thymoquinone, capsaicin, trans- 2 -hexenal and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (MIC 4 – 32 μg/ml) possessed the strongest antibacterial effect. In case of extracts, common hop (Humulus lupulus L.) and myrtle (Myrtus communis L.) methanolic-dichloromethane extracts exhibited the highest growth-inhibitory effect with MICs ranging from 2 to 8 μg/ml. Acute oral toxicity {{of the most active}} natural products was determined on adult honey bees, showing them as non-toxic at concentrations as high as 100 μg peer bee. Our study leads to identification of highly potent natural products effective against AFB in vitro with very low MICs compared to those reported in literature, low toxicity to adult honey bees and commercial availability suggesting them as perspective, low cost and consumer-acceptable agents for control of AFB...|$|R

40|$|Paenibacillus larvae, the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} the globally occurring epizootic American <b>Foulbrood</b> (AFB) <b>of</b> honey <b>bees,</b> causes intestinal infections in honey bee larvae which develop into systemic infections inevitably leading to larval death. Massive brood mortality might eventually lead to collapse of the entire colony. Molecular mechanisms of host-microbe interactions in this system and of differences in virulence between P. larvae genotypes are poorly understood. Recently, it was demonstrated that the degradation of the peritrophic matrix lining the midgut epithelium is a key step in pathogenesis of P. larvae infections. Here, we present the isolation and identification of PlCBP 49, a modular, chitin-degrading protein of P. larvae and demonstrate that this enzyme is crucial for the degradation of the larval peritrophic matrix during infection. PlCBP 49 contains a module belonging to the auxiliary activity 10 (AA 10, formerly CBM 33) family of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) which are able to degrade recalcitrant polysaccharides. Using chitin-affinity purified PlCBP 49, we provide evidence that PlCBP 49 degrades chitin via a metal ion-dependent, oxidative mechanism, as already described {{for members of the}} AA 10 family. Using P. larvae mutants lacking PlCBP 49 expression, we analyzed in vivo biological functions of PlCBP 49. In the absence of PlCBP 49 expression, peritrophic matrix degradation was markedly reduced and P. larvae virulence was nearly abolished. This indicated that PlCBP 49 is a key virulence factor for the species P. larvae. The identification of the functional role of PlCBP 49 in AFB pathogenesis broadens our understanding of this important family of chitin-binding and -degrading proteins, especially in those bacteria that can also act as entomopathogens...|$|R
40|$|American <b>foulbrood</b> disease <b>of</b> honey <b>bees</b> {{is caused}} by the {{bacterium}} Paenibacillus larvae. Infection occurs per os in larvae and systemic infection requires a breaching of the host peritrophic matrix and midgut epithelium. Genetic variation exists for both bacterial virulence and host resistance, and a general immunity is achieved by larvae as they age, the basis of which has not been identified. To quickly identify a pool of candidate genes responsive to P. larvae infection, we sequenced transcripts from larvae inoculated with P. larvae at 12 hours post-emergence and incubated for 72 hours, and compared expression levels to a control cohort. We identified 75 genes with significantly higher expression and six genes with significantly lower expression. In addition to several antimicrobial peptides, two genes encoding peritrophic-matrix domains were also up-regulated. Extracellular matrix proteins, proteases/protease inhibitors, and members of the Osiris gene family were prevalent among differentially regulated genes. However, analysis of Drosophila homologs of differentially expressed genes revealed spatial and temporal patterns consistent with developmental asynchrony as a likely confounder of our results. We therefore used qPCR to measure the consistency of gene expression changes for a subset of differentially expressed genes. A replicate experiment sampled at both 48 and 72 hours post infection allowed further discrimination of genes likely to be involved in host response. The consistently responsive genes in our test set included a hymenopteran-specific protein tyrosine kinase, a hymenopteran specific serine endopeptidase, a cytochrome P 450 (CYP 9 Q 1), and a homolog of trynity, a zona pellucida domain protein. Of the known honey bee antimicrobial peptides, apidaecin was responsive at both time-points studied whereas hymenoptaecin was more consistent in its level of change between biological replicates and had the greatest increase in expression by RNA-seq analysis...|$|R
40|$|Paenibacillus larvae larvae, the causative agent <b>of</b> American <b>foulbrood</b> disease <b>of</b> honey <b>bee</b> larvae occurs {{throughout}} the world and is found in all beekeeping areas of Argentina. Microbiological analysis of 394 honey samples obtained from bee hives from Buenos Aires province (Argentina) from three years of sampling (1999 – 2001) yielded 219 positive cases (55. 6 %). The incidence of P. l. larvae infected honey samples for 1999 was 68. 1 % (n = 160), for 2000 47. 1 % (n = 102), and 46. 2 % for 2001 (n = 132). The mean values of spore contamination for the three-year study showed a continuous reduction, probably due to good practices of disease management by beekeepers by breeding bees for hygienic behaviour and reduction of antibiotic treatments for control of AFB. P. l. larvae populations isolated from honey were characterized {{on the basis of}} DNA fingerprints using the repetitive-sequence-based polymerase chain reaction technique (rep-PCR) with BOX- and REP- sequencespecific primers. Four distinctive patterns, named A, B, C, and D, were distinguishable among the isolates. Genotype D was not observed in previous studies; this finding could be correlated with a new introduction of the disease in Argentina since 1997 when only three genotypes (A, B, and C) were confirmed. The rep-PCR fingerprint patterns obtained were compared with the patterns generated by a world-wide collection of P. l. larvae strains. The same 4 genotypes patterns were found within a collection of strains from 18 different countries of the world. It is {{important to point out that}} pattern C was only found in Argentina and in one sample from Uruguay located in the border line, suggesting that genotype C could have been derived from genotype A and disseminated to Uruguay from Argentina. These findings support the hypothesis that American foulbrood disease is exposed to a limited selective pressure from climatic and environmental sources. Facultad de Ingenierí...|$|R
