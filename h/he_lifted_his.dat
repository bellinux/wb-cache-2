5|$|Gen. Lee {{arrived on}} the {{battlefield}} at about 2:30 p.m., as Rodes's men were in mid-attack. Seeing that a major assault was underway, <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> restriction on a general engagement and gave permission to Hill to resume his attacks from the morning. First in line was Heth's division again, with two fresh brigades: Pettigrew's North Carolinians and Col. John M. Brockenbrough's Virginians.|$|E

25|$|Both Worcestershire Royals and Glamorgan Dragons were {{knocked out}} before the last round of the Twenty20 Cup group stage, so the match at New Road was fairly academic. It did not stop Worcestershire from {{amassing}} {{one of the highest}} scores in Twenty20 Cup history with 223 for 9 - Ben Smith only taking 45 balls to smack 105 off the Glamorgan bowlers, with twelve fours and six sixes, as <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> career Twenty20 average from 15 to 20.62. The partnership of 149 with Graeme Hick was enough to win the match for Worcestershire, as Glamorgan never quite got the hang of Shoaib Akhtar - who bowled two overs for 14 with a no-ball and a wide. Glamorgan ended up only losing five wickets, but 224 was always too much to ask, and they finished with a total 186 for 5.|$|E

25|$|Räikkönen {{was born}} in Espoo. He had {{a long line of}} success in karting from the age of 10. His first race outside Finland was in Monaco when he was 15 years old. During the race, the {{steering}} wheel broke, but he continued, informing his mechanic by frantically waving the steering wheel in the air on the home straight. Räikkönen's next Monaco race was also memorable; he was thrown {{on the wrong side of}} the safety fence in a first lap collision but continued driving until running out of road. Undeterred, <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> kart back onto the track and continued to race. His mechanic thought Räikkönen had retired, but he eventually caught up with the other competitors and finished third. In 1998 he was 1st in the Nordic Championship at Varna in Norway. In 1999, Räikkönen placed second in the European Formula Super A championship for the Dutch PDB Racing Team– run by 1980 world champion Peter de Bruijn– utilising a Gillard chassis. He also competed in the Formula Ford Euro Cup. By the age of twenty, he had won the British Formula Renault winter series of 1999, winning the first four races of the year. In 2000, he won seven out of ten events in the Formula Renault UK Championship. Combined, over these two series of Formula Renault, he won 13 out of 23 events– a 56% win rate.|$|E

He did not publicly express this opinion {{at the request of}} his producer until 2009, when <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> boycott and attended San Diego Comic Con International as a favor to his friend John Lasseter. Miyazaki also expressed his opinion about the terrorist attack at the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, criticizing the magazine's decision to publish the content cited as the trigger for the incident.|$|E

500|$|Septimius Udaynath, Latinized as Odaenathus (Palmyrene: [...] (...) , spelled Oḏainaṯ; [...] (...) [...] 220 – 267 AD), was {{the founder}} king (Mlk) of the Palmyrene Kingdom {{centered}} at Palmyra, Syria. <b>He</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> city {{from the position}} of a regional center subordinate to Rome into the supreme power in the East. Odaenathus was born into an aristocratic Palmyrene family that received Roman citizenship in the 190s under the Severan dynasty. He was the son of Hairan the descendant of Nasor. The circumstances surrounding his rise are ambiguous; he became the lord (Ras) of the city, a position created for him, as early as the 240s and by 258, he was styled a consularis, indicating a high status in the Roman Empire.|$|E
500|$|According to folk {{tradition}} Marko never died; he {{lives on in}} a cave, in a moss-covered den or in an unknown land. A Serbian legend recounts that Marko once fought a battle in which so many men were killed that the soldiers (and their horses) swam in blood. <b>He</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> hands towards heaven and said, [...] "Oh God, what am I going to do now?" [...] God took pity on Marko, transporting him and Šarac to a cave (where Marko stuck his sabre into a rock and fell asleep). There is moss in the cave; Šarac eats it bit by bit, while the sabre slowly emerges from the rock. When it falls {{on the ground and}} Šarac finishes the moss, Marko will awaken and reenter the world. Some allegedly saw him after descending into a deep pit, where he lived in a large house in front of which Šarac was seen. Others saw him in a faraway land, living in a cave. According to Macedonian tradition Marko drank [...] "eagle's water", which made him immortal; he is with Elijah in heaven.|$|E

On July 1, Steve Allen introduced Presley on The Steve Allen Show, and Presley, dressed in formal evening wear, said, [...] "I think that I have on something tonight that's not quite right for evening wear." [...] Allen asked, [...] "What's that, Elvis?" [...] "Blue suede shoes" [...] was the answer, as <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> left foot to show the audience. Presley mentioned blue suede shoes a second time on this show: in a song during the [...] "Range Roundup" [...] comedy skit with Allen, Andy Griffith, and Imogene Coca, he delivered the line, [...] "I'm a-warnin' you galoots, don't step on my blue suede shoes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a letter}} to Varro on c. April 20, 46 BC, Cicero {{outlined}} his strategy under Caesar's dictatorship. Cicero, however, was taken completely by surprise when the Liberatores assassinated Caesar on the ides of March, 44 BC. Cicero {{was not included in}} the conspiracy, even though the conspirators were sure of his sympathy. Marcus Junius Brutus called out Cicero's name, asking him to restore the republic when <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> bloodstained dagger after the assassination. A letter Cicero wrote in February 43 BC to Trebonius, one of the conspirators, began, [...] "How I could wish that you had invited me to that most glorious banquet on the Ides of March"! Cicero became a popular leader during the period of instability following the assassination. He had no respect for Mark Antony, who was scheming to take revenge upon Caesar's murderers. In exchange for amnesty for the assassins, he arranged for the Senate to agree not to declare Caesar to have been a tyrant, which allowed the Caesarians to have lawful support and kept Caesar's reforms and policies intact.|$|E
2500|$|A {{story that}} haunted Burton {{up to his}} death (recounted {{in some of his}} obituaries) was that he came close to being {{discovered}} one night when <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> robe to urinate rather than squatting as an Arab would. It was said that he was seen by an Arab and, in order to avoid exposure, killed him. Burton denied this, pointing out that killing the boy would almost certainly have led to his being discovered as an impostor. Burton became so tired of denying this accusation that he took to baiting his accusers, although he was said to enjoy the notoriety and even once laughingly claimed to have done it. A doctor once asked him: [...] "How do you feel when you have killed a man?", Burton retorted: [...] "Quite jolly, what about you?". When asked by a priest about the same incident Burton is said to have replied: [...] "Sir, I'm proud to say I have committed every sin in the Decalogue." [...] Stanley Lane-Poole, a Burton detractor, reported that Burton [...] "confessed rather shamefacedly that he had never killed anybody at any time." ...|$|E
