50|$|When {{stars like}} the Sun are near end of life, they send their outer layers into space to create <b>glowing</b> <b>clouds</b> of gas, a {{planetary}} nebulae. This ejection of mass is uneven, and planetary nebulae can have complex shapes. NGC 6818 shows knotty filament-like structures and distinct layers of material, {{with a bright}} and enclosed central bubble surrounded by a larger, more diffuse cloud.|$|R
60|$|After {{weeks of}} rain, {{as if to}} make amend for useless severity, the sun came out, a fresh {{westerly}} breeze sprang up, and the sky filled with <b>glowing</b> <b>clouds</b> flooded with tender light.

60|$|With eyes {{of horror}} we looked about us, but all was {{perfectly}} quiet and still. I approached the black {{square of the}} studio door, expecting with every slow step that some atrocious shape would hurl itself out of it. But nothing came, and all was silent inside the room. Peeping and peering, our hearts in our mouths, {{we came to the}} very threshold, and stared into the darkness. There was still no sound, but in one direction there was also no darkness. A luminous, <b>glowing</b> <b>cloud,</b> with an incandescent centre, hovered {{in the corner of the}} room. Slowly it dimmed and faded, growing thinner and fainter, until at last the same dense, velvety blackness filled the whole studio. And with the last flickering gleam of that baleful light the Frenchman broke into a shout of joy.|$|E
50|$|In October 2013, astronomers {{using the}} European Southern Observatory's Very Large Survey Telescope (VST) {{discovered}} that Westerlund 1-26 {{is surrounded by}} a <b>glowing</b> <b>cloud</b> of ionized hydrogen.

2500|$|The {{final design}} was {{slightly}} {{different than the}} Pierce plate. [...] The Lincoln eagle faced left, not right; the clouds only formed the lower arc of a circle, and obscured {{the southwest corner of}} the shield; the olive branch was more prominent, and the arrows less numerous; and a glowing yellow sun (not <b>glowing</b> <b>clouds)</b> backed the eagle. [...] The stars around {{the outer edge of the}} solferino band were now just gilt dots.|$|R
60|$|The {{golden light}} died {{out of the}} waning moon, and afar off in the east {{a long line of}} red clouds seemed to rise out of the sea. The air was still and calm and breathless. Even the sea seemed hushed as the yellow stars faded from the sky. Behind that bank of <b>glowing</b> <b>clouds</b> was the promise of the richer and fuller day. Amber was {{becoming}} golden, and pink purple, till through a very rainbow of coloring the sun's first rays shot across the chilled waters.|$|R
5000|$|The Viper {{telescope}} {{is being used}} to image the anisotropy seen in the universe. Inflation theory states the <b>glowing</b> <b>clouds</b> of gas in the sky would be {{in the form of an}} arc about [...] degree in the sky. The Viper telescope was able to confirm inflation theory, clearly showing the length of the arc was [...] a degree. Recently the telescope was able to detect tiny fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation. This can give astronomers vast information about the distribution of matter in the proto-Universe, such as how galaxies, stars, planets, and quasars formed from the free-floating protons and electrons that made up the primordial soup.|$|R
50|$|Heteroteuthis dispar can be bioluminescent, {{emitting}} {{light from}} photophores containing bacterial symbionts. A large photophore is {{found on the}} underside and contains two pores through which the luminescent material is extruded. An iridescent shutter cover helps to filter and control the light. The squid can also secrete bioluminescent mucous from glands near the ink sac. This can be released into the water through the funnel and the <b>glowing</b> <b>cloud</b> is believed to blind or confuse predators for {{long enough for the}} squid to make its escape.|$|E
50|$|One common {{version has}} Olentzero {{being one of}} the jentillak, a mythological race of Basque giants living in the Pyrenees. Legend has it that they {{observed}} a <b>glowing</b> <b>cloud</b> in the sky one day. None of them could look at this bright cloud except for a very old, nearly blind man. When asked to examine it, he confirmed their fears and told them that it was a sign that Jesus will be born soon. According to some stories, the old man asked the giants to throw him off a cliff to avoid having to live through Christianisation. Having obliged him, the giants tripped on the way down and died themselves except Olentzero.|$|E
50|$|One {{attempt to}} {{replicate}} ignis fatuus under laboratory conditions was in 1980 by British geologist Alan A. Mills of Leicester University. Though he did succeed {{in creating a}} cool <b>glowing</b> <b>cloud</b> by mixing crude phosphine and natural gas, {{the color of the}} light was green and it produced copious amounts of acrid smoke. This was contrary to most eyewitness accounts of ignis fatuus. As an alternative, Mills proposed in 2000 that ignis fatuus may instead be cold flames. These are luminescent pre-combustion halos that occur when various compounds are heated to just below ignition point. Cold flames are indeed typically bluish in color and as their name suggests, they generate very little heat. Cold flames occur {{in a wide variety of}} compounds, including hydrocarbons (including methane), alcohols, aldehydes, oils, acids, and even waxes. However it is unknown if cold flames occur naturally, though a lot of compounds which exhibit cold flames are the natural byproducts of organic decay.|$|E
5000|$|Welcome to Night Vales plot {{consists}} of longform storytelling. Individual episodes usually function as standalone narratives and only rarely contain significant developments in storyline. The writers employ running jokes and plot arcs, advanced {{slowly through the}} events described in the podcast. For example, The <b>Glow</b> <b>Cloud,</b> one of the series most iconic characters, hypnotizes the townspeople with its colors and noxious gas, making people chant [...] "ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY GLOW CLOUD," [...] and eventually becomes president of Night Vales school board.

40|$|AbstractA {{phenomenon}} of <b>glowing</b> <b>clouds</b> {{occurred at the}} border of Puszcza Niepołomicka {{in the vicinity of}} Niepołomice near Craco. Especially at spring and autumn nights, The most plausible explanation includes oxidation of gaseous P–bearing compounds with formation of phosphine, diphosphine and hydrogen. In the environment of variable water conditions in Pleistocene sands bedded by Miocene clays, phosphorus contained in bone remnants of the mass grave in the form of calcium hydroxyapatite alters to phosphides in the subsoil to gaseous forms of phosphor hydrogen compounds. This phenomenon is favored by microorganisms, including those from human digestive system, slightly acidic reaction of the soil (pine tree needles), the presence of heavy elements in soil (also from ammunition cartridges), high relative moisture of the air at night and the presence of the inversion air layer...|$|R
5000|$|Valyra did not race as {{a two-year-old}} and made her first racecourse {{appearance}} on 14 April 2012 at Bordeaux Le Bouscat Racecourse, when she won by {{three quarters of a}} length from <b>Glowing</b> <b>Cloud.</b> She then won a conditions race at Chantilly by three lengths form O'Keefe. Valyra started the Prix de Diane as a 25/1 outsider, with Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Beauty Parlour starting as the 5/6 favourite. Jockey Johnny Murtagh settled Valyra near the rear of the 12-runner field {{in the early stages of}} the race. She quickened with 2 furlongs left to run and challenged the leader, Beauty Parlour, with 150 yards remaining. She took the lead with 120 yards left and ran on to win by three quarters of a length from Beauty Parlour, with Rjwa a further three lengths back in third place. On 29 August she sustained a hind leg fracture when cantering on the beach at Deauville and had to be put down. Her trainer Jean-Claude Rouget said [...] "It is a terrible accident and a great loss for His Highness the Aga Khan and our stable. We have lost a filly with true class.

40|$|The <b>glowing</b> <b>cloud</b> {{near the}} ram {{surfaces}} of the Space Shuttle was observed with a hand-held, intensified spectrograph operated by the astronauts from the aft-flight-deck of the Space Shuttle. The spectral measurements were made between 400 and 800 nm with a resolution of 3 nm. Analysis of the spectral response of the instrument and the transmission of the Shuttle window was performed on orbit using earth-airglow OH Meinel bands. This analysis resulted in a correction of the Shuttle glow intensity in the spectral region between 700 and 800 nm. The data presented in this report is in better agreement with laboratory measurements of the NO 2 continuum...|$|E
40|$|Positive and {{negative}} streamers are studied in ambient air at 1 bar; they {{emerge from a}} needle electrode placed 40 mm above a planar electrode. The amplitudes of the applied voltage pulses range from 5 to 96 kV; most pulses have rise times of 30 ns or shorter. Diameters, velocities and energies of the streamers are measured. Two regimes are identified; a low voltage regime where only positive streamers appear and a high voltage regime where both positive {{and negative}} streamers exist. Below 5 kV, no streamers emerge. In the range from 5 to 40 kV, positive streamers form, while the negative discharges only form a <b>glowing</b> <b>cloud</b> at the electrode tip, but no streamers. For 5 – 20 kV, diameters and velocities of the positive streamers have the minimal values of d = 0. 2 mm and v ˜ 105 ms- 1. For 20 – 40 kV, their diameters increase by a factor of 6 while the voltage increases only by a factor of 2. Above the transition value of 40 kV, streamers of both polarities form; they strongly resemble each other, though the positive ones propagate further; their diameters continue to increase with applied voltage. For 96 kV, positive streamers attain diameters of 3 mm and velocities of 4 × 106 ms- 1; negative streamers are about 20 % slower and thinner. An empirical fit formula for the relation between velocity v and diameter d is v = 0. 5 d 2 mm- 1 ns- 1 for both polarities. Streamers of both polarities dissipate energies of the order of several millijoules per streamer while crossing the gap...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Since the proto-planetary disk {{model for}} solar system {{formation}} {{has been extensively}} falsified, it can now be hypothesized that Gomez’s Hamburger (IRAS 18059 - 3211) is a new electromagnetic z-pinch {{that is in the}} very beginning of the birth a single star. Other pictures of stars being born are included and a illustration by the author how this process happens. It was hypothesized that at the center of this object there is an unseen star surrounded by dust and gas called the “proto-planetary disk”. In this example the “hamburger ” is the disk of dust that blocks the light of the star and is surrounded by large “buns ” of plasma which are illuminated by the blocked star in the center. [1] There are a few problems with this explanation. No star is seen in this picture so to infer a star is conjecture to begin with because there just might not be a star even present at all! There just might be what is seen, two <b>glowing</b> <b>clouds</b> of plasma that are reaching towards each other because of impending magnetic confinement. This picture can help in the ushering in a new paradigm of an electromagnetic universe because the gravitationally powered universe does not work at all. [2][3][4][5] Also, the proto-planetary disk model has been falsified extensively yet kept regardless of its falsification and the supposed scientific dogma still has people confused because of inconsistent definitions.
