40|$|To {{investigate}} the microbial <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> ethyl acetate and toluene mixtures in biofiltration, three strains were selected, identified and studied in a shake-flask culture, and finally inoculated into biofilters. These strains, namely AC 6, TO 3 and B 5, can degrade different substrates {{at a different}} rate. The results showed that competitive inhibition from substrate and microbial community would affect the toluene degradation efficiency. Owing to substrate competition, the toluene <b>degradation</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> B 5 would decrease {{in the presence of}} high concentration of ethyl acetate. However, the addition <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> AC 6 would alleviate such inhibition because it could remove ethyl acetate rapidly.

40|$|Abstract. The {{analysis}} of a large range of sintered parts shows the fact, they are strained at contact fatigue, {{in most of the}} cases. The Hertzian pressure, at which materials in contact are subjected, establishes the appearance of variable stress, which records a maximum at some depth under the contact surface. In the case of sintered materials this stress variation conducts to a faster <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>strained</b> surface than in the case of compact materials. This is because the stress variation establishes a critical state at the level of stress concentrators, generated by pores, standing in material structure, leading to formation of some cracks which may propagate at the level inter-granular necks, producing removal for some particles of material. The accomplished research on sintered materials, having different chemical compositions, revealed the fact, at the beginning, that the materials undergo a cold hardening, indicated by a hardness increasing, followed by some cracks generating, accompanied by their extension and material removal. This process develops in the same mode for all investigated materials, but with different intensity...|$|R

Furthermore, animals immunized with the intracellular replication-deficient vaccine strain are resistant to lethal challenge with a virulent WT <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> L. monocytogenes. These studies suggest a general strategy for developing safe and effective, attenuated intracellular replication-deficient vaccine <b>strains</b> for stimulation <b>of</b> protective immune responses against intracellular bacterial pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Several {{bacterial}} cultures were isolated that {{are able to}} degrade quinoline and to transform or to degrade methylquinolines. The <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> quinoline by <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> Pseudomonas aeruginosa QP and P. putida QP produced hydroxyquinolines, a transient pink compound, and other undetermined products. The quinoline-degrading <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> P. aeruginosa QP and P. putida QP hydroxylated a limited number of methylquinolines but could not degrade them, nor could they transform 2 -methylquinoline, isoquinoline, or pyridine. Another pseudomonad, Pseudomonas sp. strain MQP, was isolated that could degrade 2 -methylquinoline. P. aeruginosa QP was able to degrade or to transform quinoline and a few methylquinolines in a complex heterocyclic nitrogen-containing fraction of a shale oil. All of the quinoline- and methylquinoline-degrading strains have multiple plasmids including a common 250 -kilobase plasmid. The 225 -, 250 -, and 320 -kilobase plasmids of the P. aeruginosa QP strain all contained genes involved in quinoline metabolism...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of animal wastes on crude oil <b>degradation</b> potential <b>of</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus subtilis isolated from animal wastes (poultry and pig droppings) and petroleum-polluted soil was compared in laboratory studies. Both bacterial strains {{were selected for}} high crude oil degradation ability after screening many isolates by the 2, 6 -dichlorophenol indophenol method. Analyses by gas chromatography (GC) showed that <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> crude oil was markedly enhanced (88. 3 – 97. 3 % vs 72. 1 – 78. 8 %) in soil amended with animal wastes {{as indicated by the}} reduction of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH). TPH reduction by animal waste bacterial strains in animal waste-amended soil was more than the reduction by strains from soil contaminated with petroleum (P < 0. 001). The greatest reduction of TPH (96. 6 – 97. 3 % vs 80. 4 – 95. 9 %) was by poultry waste strains and it occurred in soil amended with poultry waste. GC analyses of n-alkanes showed that although shorter chains were preferentially degraded [32. 0 – 78. 5 % (C 8 – 23) vs 6. 3 – 18. 5 % (C 24 – 36) ] in normal soil, biodegradation of longer chains increased to 38. 4 – 46. 3 % in animal waste-amended soil inoculated with the same animal wastes’ strains. The results indicate that these animal waste <b>strains</b> may be <b>of</b> potential application for bioremediation of oil-polluted soil {{in the presence of the}} wastes from where they were isolated...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} for the XZEH medicine {{wastewater treatment}} biotechnology was conducted. The {{results show that}} it needs to increase 28 % of the aeration tank volume {{in order to meet the}} effluent COD concentration at the first grade wastewater discharge standard level in China. If the engineered strain Xhhh and informatics software (Ebis) were used, the specific <b>degradation</b> rate <b>of</b> Xhhh <b>strain</b> may be higher 128 % than that of the natural bacterium XZ strain and the aeration tank needed may be 51 % decreased. This should be a potential technical patch for improving the biotechnological effectiveness and making the effluent at the first grade discharge standard. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|Biodegradation {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in 250  mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100  mL MSM with 2 C 4 NP as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy. The 2 C 4 NP <b>degradation</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> CNP- 8 was determined by monitoring the bacterial growth (OD 600) and 2 C 4 NP consumption. To investigate the effect of pH and temperature on 2 C 4 NP degradation, biodegradation {{experiments were}} performed at different pH (4 – 10) and temperatures (20 – 40  °C). Glucose (0.2, 0.5 or 5  g/L) was added into the MSM to study the effect of supplemented carbon source on 2 C 4 NP degradation. For these biodegradation experiments, strain CNP- 8 was initially grown in MSM[*]+[*]lysogeny broth (LB) (4 : 1, v/v) containing 0.3  mM of 2 C 4 NP. After overnight growth, cells were harvested, washed twice and resuspended in fresh MSM. The cells suspension was added in the test medium at initial OD 600 of 0.05, and the flasks were then shaken at 180  rpm. All above experiments were performed in triplicate.|$|R
40|$|With a new {{enrichment}} protocol, pentachlorophenol (PCP) -degrading bacteria {{were isolated}} from soil, water, and sewage. When characterized, all isolates were related and shared {{characteristics of the}} genus Arthrobacter. Growth rates for strain NC were determined {{for a number of}} substrates, including PCP and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol. Changes in PCP concentration affected growth rate and length of the lag phase but not cell yield. Increasing the pH from 6. 8 to 7. 8 decreased the length of the lag phase for growth on PCP. Cessation of growth, upon incremental addition of PCP, was found to be related to a decrease in pH rather than to a buildup of a toxic metabolite. <b>Degradation</b> <b>of</b> PCP by <b>strain</b> NC was shown to be complete...|$|R
