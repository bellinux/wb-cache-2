He has a strong relationship with Red, joining him on his regular fishing trips and taking part in many aspects of the Possum Lodge operations. He also takes his fatherhood very seriously, often trying to pass on his ideas and wisdom to other people (most notably Harold). He generally tells people exactly what <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> them, even if it means offending them.|$|E
25|$|Abhiraj Rajendra Mishra, former Vice-Chancellor of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University and {{winner of}} Sahitya Akademi Award in Sanskrit, {{writes in the}} {{introduction}} of the epic that in an age where the prevalence of Sanskrit is rare, several works in recent past have been published as epics which are devoid of the traditional features of a Sanskrit Mahākāvya, and have errors in grammar at many places. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam as an exception. He further says that this is an epic which nourishes the tradition of Ṛṣis, and with this composition the contemporary Sanskrit literature has been blessed.|$|E

He has tried numerous forms of [...] "treatment", from eating figs and praying to wearing a rubber band on his wrist to flick whenever <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> men, but to no avail. During {{the course of the}} film, David decides to visit the Chabad rabbi to whom he first came out.|$|E
500|$|Homer's {{campaign}} starts badly {{with him}} being beaten up after interrupting U2's PopMart Tour concert, but picks up when <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> a slogan: [...] "Can't someone else do it?" [...] Homer spreads his {{message to the}} town and promises expensive services such as round-the-clock garbage service and sanitation workers doing all possible cleaning, leading to his landslide victory in the election. After being sworn in, he shows his plans by singing a parody of [...] "The Candy Man" [...] entitled [...] "The Garbage Man".|$|E
500|$|One critic, Alice Fannin, {{says the}} [...] "loosely plotted" [...] story gives no true {{explanation}} for why Mr. Mallard leaves the island in the Charles River or why the Mallards did not simply stay on the lagoon island {{in the first place}} and avoid the bicyclists on the shore. However, McCloskey has stated himself that <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> himself as an artist who writes children's books and not vice versa. Fannin also finds the characterization lacking, that is, the Mallards represent [...] "rather stereotypically concerned parents", often showing the same facial expressions and rarely showing expressiveness.|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Ode to Branson," [...] {{which is}} {{performed}} by several [...] "washed-up" [...] celebrities, was composed by Alf Clausen and written by Vitti. Even though Vitti received sole credit for writing the song, {{parts of the}} lyrics were written by Simpsons writer Carolyn Omine, which were then revised by fellow writer Matt Selman. Selman was especially satisfied with the rhyme sung by Mr. T; he stated that whenever he feels down, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> that rhyme and that it [...] "boosts [...] up inside." [...] The episode features American actress Olympia Dukakis as Grampa's love interest Zelda. American comedian Bill Saluga also makes an appearance, as his television character Ray J. Johnson. The owner of the minivan is portrayed by series regular Hank Azaria, who imitated the voice of Clark Gable for the character.|$|E
500|$|Influenced by such blues-rock guitarists as Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page, {{and such}} jazz fusion players as John McLaughlin, and Al Di Meola, Lukather {{is known for}} a [...] "melodic and intense" [...] playing style. He has also cited Steely Dan as a major long-time influence—one that emerges {{prominently}} in later solo work such as All's Well That Ends Well. Journalist Jude Gold notes that his vibrato is very pronounced and his [...] "exaggerated wide bends" [...] are distinctive and quickly recognizable. Well-versed in music theory, Lukather can follow chord charts and changes in a way typical of jazz musicians—this ability enhances his value as a session musician. In interviews, he has explained how <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> the guitar in a [...] "chordal cluster" [...] format, and not the typical [...] "linear scale" [...] format.|$|E
500|$|The filmmaker {{has been}} praised {{by many of}} his contemporaries, and some have cited his work as {{influencing}} their own. Rupert Wyatt, director of Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), {{said in an interview}} that <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> Nolan as a [...] "trailblazer... he is to be hugely admired as a master filmmaker, but also someone who has given others behind him a stick to beat back the naysayers who never thought a modern mass audience would be willing to embrace story and character as much as spectacle". Michael Mann complimented Nolan for his [...] "singular vision" [...] and called him [...] "a complete auteur". Nicolas Roeg said of Nolan, [...] " [...] films have a magic to them ... People talk about 'commercial art' and the term is usually self-negating; Nolan works in the commercial arena and yet there's something very poetic about his work." [...] Martin Scorsese identified Nolan as a filmmaker creating [...] "beautifully made films on a big scale".|$|E

500|$|The {{architectural}} style adopted by William Curtis Green, {{largely based on}} Owen William's design, was {{a departure from the}} Neoclassical with its reinforced concrete covered over with terrazzo slabs. British Modernists were disappointed with the result, describing Green's adaptation as, [...] "a genteel period piece which looks the compromise it is". In comparison to some of the other hotels in London such as the Lanesborough, the building's exterior is unremarkable. It is eight storeys high aside from the ground floor, with the central bay containing three windows on each floor. Christopher Matthew has stated that <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> the Dorchester as a [...] "rather American hotel", {{not only because of the}} strong association with American actors such as Elizabeth Taylor, but because the sweeping 1930s facade reminded him of many of those which appeared in American film musicals. However, he notes that the hotel still remains [...] "very much an English hotel". The hotel became a Grade II Listed Building in January 1981.|$|E
500|$|The {{museum has}} so far {{received}} pledges from four men—an Icelander, a German, an American and a Briton—to donate their penises. Canadian film-maker Zach Math comments that the American, Tom Mitchell, [...] "is an ordinary guy but he has this quirk where <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> his penis as a separate entity from his body— Elmo. He has this dream that he {{wants it to be}} the most famous penis in the world." [...] According to Sigurður, Mitchell [...] "wanted to have his penis cut off even during his lifetime and then visit the museum." [...] Mitchell sent a cast of his penis to serve as a substitute in the meantime, along with photographs of it dressed up as Santa Claus and Abraham Lincoln. The donor also tattooed his penis with the Stars and Stripes to make it look more appealing. He says that [...] "I've always thought it'd be really cool for my penis to be the first true penis celebrity" [...] and has made it the star of its own comic book, Elmo: Adventures of a Superhero Penis.|$|E
500|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1559 several foreign princes were vying for the Queen's hand; indignant at Elizabeth's little serious {{interest}} in their candidate, the Spanish ambassador de Quadra and his Imperial colleague were informing each other and their superiors that Lord Robert was sending his wife poison and that Elizabeth was only fooling them, [...] "keeping Lord Robert's enemies and the country engaged with words until this wicked deed of killing his wife is consummated". Parts of the nobility also held Dudley responsible for Elizabeth's failure to marry, and plots to assassinate him abounded. In March 1560 de Quadra informed PhilipII: [...] "Lord Robert told somebody … that if he live another year {{he will be in}} a very different position from now. … They say that <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> divorcing his wife." [...] Lady Amy never saw her husband again after her London visit in 1559. A projected trip of his to visit her and other family never materialized. Queen Elizabeth did not really allow her favourite a wife; according to a contemporary court chronicle, he [...] "was commanded to say that he did nothing with her, when he came to her, as seldom he did".|$|E
6000|$|... "So little does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that, that <b>he</b> {{is turning}} out his reefs," [...] {{answered}} Hazard. [...] "See! there is a hand aloft loosening his topsail--and there goes up a whole mainsail, already!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, dear, {{what will}} <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me?" [...] ejaculated Margaret; but {{nevertheless}} I fancy {{that there must}} have been some elation in her bosom when she regarded herself and the freckled muslin in the glass.|$|R
500|$|Sally invites Glen {{to visit}} while Don and Megan {{are at work}} the next day. He agrees. The next morning, she waits for Megan to leave the {{apartment}} before rushing to change out of her pajamas. Glen arrives at the Draper apartment. They visit the American Museum of Natural History. He admits that he told friends {{he was going to}} [...] "do it" [...] with her, but that <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> her as a little sister. Feeling ill, Sally runs to the bathroom and finds blood on her underwear. Arriving home, Megan looks for Sally and sees Glen's duffel bag. Sally takes a cab to the Francis house and sprints to the bathroom. She later hugs Betty tightly and explains that her menstrual cycle has started. Glen shows up at the Draper apartment and tells Megan that Sally left him at the museum. Betty phones and tells her that Sally [...] "became a woman today," [...] and just needed her mother. Megan insists Glen stay until she can drive him to his train. Betty gives Sally a hot water bottle and assures her that starting her cycle means [...] "everything is working." ...|$|E
500|$|Lindblom {{worked on}} several other Nintendo games {{and left in}} 1996. He later worked at studios such as Electronic Arts, Vivendi Games, Midway Games, and THQ. Lindblom {{established}} Partly Cloudy Games with friends around 2009. The company has contracted with Microsoft and is also developing a real-time strategy Facebook game named The Robot Apocalypse. , Lindblom runs Carried Away Games, a mobile games studio. He described many of the games he worked on in his career as [...] "forgettable" [...] and the eventual popularity of EarthBound as [...] "satisfying". He cited {{the example of a}} wedding proposal done through hacked text in EarthBound as something he appreciated. After following the fan community from afar, in mid-2012, Lindblom approached the Fangamer booth at the Penny Arcade Expo and explained his involvement in the game. When EarthBound was announced for the Wii U Virtual Console, the press began to show greater interest in Lindblom's work. Lindblom had planned a book about the game's development, release, and fandom as a Kickstarter project before a reply from Nintendo discouraged him from pursuing the idea. He did not plan to profit from the book, but felt he [...] "owed" [...] the fan community for its dedication. In response, he said he plans to continue his ongoing dialogue with the community. Lindblom told Kotaku that <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> EarthBound as his [...] "finest accomplishment".|$|E
2500|$|The Libertines' lyrics {{occasionally}} reference {{their idea}} of sailing on [...] "the good ship Albion to Arcadia".
