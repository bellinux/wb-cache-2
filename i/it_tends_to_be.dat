The change in wind can be 90degrees in direction and 40kt in speed. Even a nocturnal (overnight) low level jet can sometimes be observed. <b>It</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strongest towards sunrise.

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is {{the most}} widespread member of its genus, breeding in temperate woodlands across Eurasia from Ireland to Japan. It prefers mature trees, and in most of Europe, where it shares its range with short-toed treecreeper, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found mainly in coniferous forest, especially spruce and fir. However, where {{it is the only}} treecreeper, as in European Russia, or the British Isles, it frequents broadleaved or mixed woodland in preference to conifers.|$|E
5|$|The Jackson's {{hartebeest}} {{does not}} have a clear taxonomic status. It is regarded as a hybrid between the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. The African Antelope Database (1998) treats it as synonymous to the Lelwel hartebeest. From Lake Baringo to Mount Kenya, the Jackson's hartebeest significantly resembles the Lelwel hartebeest, whereas from Lake Victoria to {{the southern part of the}} Rift Valley <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more like the Coke's hartebeest.|$|E

5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as primary ingredients. Various spices are typically used, and <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a moist cake. Applesauce cake prepared with chunky-style apple sauce {{may be less}} moist. Several additional ingredients may also be used in its preparation, and it is sometimes prepared {{and served as a}} coffee cake. The cake dates back to early colonial times in the United States. National Applesauce Cake Day occurs annually on June 6 in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|HSP is a {{systemic}} vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) and {{is characterized by}} deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children it usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults the prognosis is different than in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. And for many <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> relapsing-remitting {{over a long period}} of time rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications.|$|E
5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50â€“75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery dissection. <b>It</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E

5|$|In {{the board}} (and card) game domain, 4X {{is less of}} a {{distinct}} genre, {{in part because of the}} practical constraints of components and playing time. The Civilization board game that gave rise to Sid Meier's Civilization computer game, for instance, has no exploration and no extermination. Unless extermination is targeted at non-player entities, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> either nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) or certainly unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before extermination can be completed) in board games.|$|E
5|$|It is a hardy breed, {{and can be}} stubborn, {{leading to}} issues with {{training}}. A Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly interested in toys, especially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits, as well as natural instincts to both bark and dig holes. It is ranked 47th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} breeds {{in much of}} Europe and {{temperate}} Asia, although it is absent from the treeless far north, and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast Europe, Turkey and the Middle East. In these warmer southern areas, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found in the milder uplands and coastal regions. Nominate T. v. viscivorus breeds in Europe and in Asia east to the Ob, beyond which it is replaced by T. v. bonapartei.

50|$|Though {{generally}} regarded as {{the oldest of the}} Arabic metres, rajaz was not highly regarded in the pre- and early Islamic periods, being seen as similar to (and at times indistinguishable from) the rhymed prose form saj'. <b>It</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for low-status, everyday genres such as lullabies, or for improvisation, for example improvised incitements to battle.|$|R
5|$|Wales has {{a complex}} {{geological}} history which has left it a largely mountainous country. The coastal plain is narrow {{in the north}} and west of the country but wider in the south, where the Vale of Glamorgan has some of the best agricultural land. Exploitation of the South Wales Coalfield during the Industrial Revolution resulted in the development of an urban economy in the South Wales Valleys, and the expansion of the port cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea for the export of coal. The smaller North Wales Coalfield was also developed at this time, but elsewhere in the country, the landscape is rural and communities are small, the economy being largely dependent on agriculture and tourism. The climate is influenced by the proximity of the country to the Atlantic Ocean and the prevailing westerly winds; thus <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mild, cloudy, wet and windy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a quantitative indicator for segmenting narrative text into coherent scenes. The indicator, called the lexical cohesion profile (LCP), records lexical cohesiveness {{of words in}} a fixed-length window moving word by word on the text. The cohesiveness of words, which represents their coherence, is computed by spreading activation on a semantic network. The basic idea of LCP is: (1) if the window is inside a scene, the words in <b>it</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cohesive, and (2) if the window is crossing a scene boundary, the words in <b>it</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> incohesive. Comparison with the scene boundaries marked {{by a number of}} subject shows that hills and valleys of the graph of LCP closely correlates with the human judgments. LCP may provide valuable information for text analysis, especially for resolving anaphora and ellipsis. 1 Introduction A text is a sequence of words with coherent structure in it.

25|$|Typically, the {{inflorescence}} is {{of great}} importance in determining the species of a given philodendron, since <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less variable than the leaves.

50|$|Coincident {{with these}} changes in Latin instruction, {{and to some degree}} {{motivating}} them, came a concern about lack of Latin proficiency among students.

By the mid-20th century, even the trivial acquaintance with Latin typical of the 19th-century student was a thing of the past.|$|R
