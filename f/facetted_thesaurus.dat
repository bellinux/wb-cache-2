Originally developed in the US more than 30 years ago, LanguaL has been managed by the European LanguaL™ technical committee since 1999. Proposals for new terms or clarification of existing terms are submitted by LanguaL™ users and published on the LanguaL™ website for discussion. This year, descriptors were added for indexing dietary supplements. LanguaL™ 2010 also includes new descriptors for USDA SR 24, revised fish and plant species information with links to authoritative sources, and an update of food additive information...|$|E

This paper discusses how classificatory structures, {{such as a}} <b>faceted</b> <b>thesaurus,</b> can be enhancedfor novice science learning. Physical geography is used as the domain discipline, and the Alexandria Digital Earth Prototype project provides the test bed for instructional materials and user analyses. The use of concept maps and topic maps for developing digital learning spaces is briefly discussed...|$|R

Those words mostly arise from Islamic doctrine and tradition and are strategically used by Islamistic groups. The work is made up of three chapters: the first introduces the whole project purposes, recipients and usages; the second describes the methodological apparatus, with particular regard to faceted classification; the third shows a prototype of the thesaurus; the Intruduction provides some corollary information useful for a better contextualization of the study...|$|R
40|$|A lattice-based {{model for}} {{information}} retrieval {{has been suggested}} in the 1960 's but {{has been seen as}} a theoretical possibility hard to practically apply ever since. This paper attempts to revive the lattice model and demonstrate its applicability in an information retrieval system, FaIR, that incorporates a graphical representation of a <b>faceted</b> <b>thesaurus.</b> It shows how Boolean queries can be lattice-theoretically related to the concepts of the thesaurus and visualized within the thesaurus display. An advantage of FaIR is that it allows for a high level of transparency of the system which can be controlled by the user...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: During {{the last}} few years, {{improvements}} in Renewable Sources to Building Construction, contributed to intensify the terminological problem, where are evident {{a high level of}} heterogeneity, and the lack of a standardized and unambiguous vocabulary/classification system. This is due to many factors, such as building techniques and working tools evolution, technical law evolution in Italy and in Europe. In this paper we want to focus on the Italian context, proposing a methodology to face this problem, which is based on the creation of a specialist lexicon and a <b>Faceted</b> <b>Thesaurus</b> for the specific domain. These will allow to organize and structure the domain of sustainable construction and energetic saving, and to improve access to up-to-date and unambiguous information in a web-based environment...|$|R

40|$|Even for the {{experienced}} information professional, designing an efficient multipurpose information access structure {{can be a}} very difficult task. This paper argues for the use of a <b>faceted</b> <b>thesaurus</b> as the basis for organizing a small-scale institutional website. We contend that a faceted approach to knowledge organization can make the process of organization less random and more manageable. We begin by reporting on an informal survey of three institutional websites. This study underscores the problems of organization that can impact access to information. We then formalize the terminology of faceted thesauri and demonstrate its application with several examples. ANALYSES OF WEBSITE STRUCTURES Evaluation of the organizational structure of a website must necessarily involve an assessment of its hyperlink structure and of the support the linking structure provides for efficient access to information. Working from the basic assumption that a wellstructured website will improve access, websites of three leading Library and Information Science [LIS] were examined to determine {{the manner in which the}} hyperlin...|$|R

CREBITEL <b>thesaurus</b> <b>facets</b> include “Material”, “Evidence of Technique, Mark and Trace”, “Alteration”, “Intervention” and “Investigation Methods”.

Each <b>facet</b> of a <b>thesaurus</b> is represented as a mathematical lattice that is further subdivided into components. Users can graphically navigate through the Java implementation of the interface by clicking on terms that connect facets and components. Since there are many applications for thesauri in the knowledge representation field, such a graphical interface has the potential of being very useful...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{retrieval}} {{effectiveness of a}} lattice-structured hypertext of indexing information (hyperindex) against a <b>faceted</b> hierarchical <b>thesaurus.</b> The former is shown {{to be at least}} as effective as the latter using formal criteria employed in an experimental setting. In addition, the automatic derivation of so called index expressions from titles is also elucidated. From these index expressions it is shown how the hyperindex can be generated. 1 Introduction At the first European Conference on Hypertext a panel discussion took place which tried to clarify the differences between hypermedia and information retrieval. In this panel criticism was leveled at the hypermedia world with regard to its lack of scientific discipline in measuring the effectiveness of hypertext systems. Although objective research has been performed in this area [ERG + 89, CE 89], much research is of a more observational character [NL 89, TS 90]. This is in contrast to the This work has been partia [...] ...|$|R

Through ‘Polygnosis’ semantic network and the display of actual examination procedures, the user now knows that overpaint on mural paintings can be detected by Multispectral Imaging and documented through a series of spectrum graphs.|$|R
40|$|To {{solve the}} mining {{safety and health}} needs of the future, access to, and sharing of, timely and {{relevant}} information will be crucial. The next generation of the Web will provide tools (RDF, OWL, SPARQL, etc) to define and link content for more effective discovery, integration, and reuse across applications and organisations. A recent Gartner Research Report (Finding and exploiting value in Semantic Web technologies on the web, May 2007) predicts these technologies will begin to coalesce in ten years. Implementing this Semantic Web requires structured web content described via metadata (information about information). If an industry or enterprise bases its metadata on a common vocabulary, it becomes possible to share and reuse information. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Mining web site provides access to more than 1500 NIOSH-developed publications, products, and topic pages on issues as diverse as ground control, respiratory diseases, and mine emergency management. As the site has grown, locating content has become increasingly difficult. To improve the searching process, a panel of internal experts representing all major research programs was established to develop a controlled vocabulary for indexing that content. The outcome is the NIOSH Mining Safety and Health <b>Thesaurus,</b> a <b>faceted,</b> hierarchical <b>thesaurus</b> containing hundreds of mining safety and health terms organised into 20 facets (eg disease injuries and disorders; hazardous events and exposures, equipment, engineering and administrative controls). One immediate goal of this project {{is to reduce the}} complexity of locating information on the NIOSH Mining web site by implementing metadata and faceted information retrieval techniques. Another goal is to stimulate discussion in the international mining community regarding developing metadata standards so the industry is ready to adopt future Semantic Web technologies to improve access to mining safety and health information...|$|R
