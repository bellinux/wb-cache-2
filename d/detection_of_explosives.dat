25|$|After {{much debate}} between the Airport Authority, {{the city of}} Burbank, the Transportation Security Administration, and Burbank residents, in November 2007 {{it was decided that}} a new $8-million to $10-million baggage {{screening}} facility for Terminal B is legal, considering the anti-growth limitations placed on the airport. The facility will house a $2.5-million explosive detection system, used for the automatic <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> within checked luggage.

25|$|In {{practice}} a detection system using this reaction works by subjecting the mine to thermal neutrons while {{searching for the}} characteristic gamma ray emitted from the excited state in nitrogen-15; these photons will only be observed when an object containing nitrogen is being subjected to the neutron irradiation. One possible neutron source is californium-252 which undergoes spontaneous fission. A better neutron source {{is to use a}} sealed tube electrostatic D-T neutron generation tube, this has the advantage that the tritium is much less radiotoxic than the californium so {{in the event of an}} accident such as an explosion, the nuclear mine detection equipment would pose a smaller threat to humans. This type of explosive detection has been proposed for use in airport security and for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> in trucks coming into military bases.|$|E

These dogs are used to detect food items in luggage being taken into the United States.

The multiple sets of voltammetric data from the different electrodic systems using Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) were integrated using multivariate analysis (PCA, NIPALS and LDA) and matched with known substances present in explosives. These combinations created a mathematical array which separated the explosives, even if the electrochemical information is buried or mixed with the background noise.

40|$|Fluorescence-based <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> analytes {{requires}} {{an understanding of the}} nature of the excited state responsible for the luminescence response of a sensing material. Many measurements are carried out to elucidate the fundamental photophysical properties of an emissive material in solution. However, simple transfer of the understanding gained from the solution measurements to the solid-state can lead to errors. This is in part due to the absence of inter-molecular interactions of the chromophores in solution, which are present in the solid-state. To understand the role of inter-molecular interactions on the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> analytes we have chosen dendrimers from two different families, D 1 and D 2, which allow facile control of the inter-molecular interactions through the choice of dendrons and emissive chromophores. Using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy we find that the solution photoinduced absorption (PA) for both materials can be explained in terms of the generation of singlet excitons, which decay to the ground state, or intersystem cross (ISC) to form a triplet exciton. In neat films however, we observe different photophysical behaviours; first, ISC to the triplet state does not occur, and second, depending on the chromophore, charge transfer and charge separated states are formed. Furthermore, we find that when either dendrimer is interfaced with analyte vapour, the singlet state is strongly quenched, generating a charge transfer state that undergoes geminate recombination...|$|R
