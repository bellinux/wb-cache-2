40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} evaluations examined {{the impact of}} water spray pressure, curtain setback distance, and external and underboom spray use for controlling respirable dust levels and sulfur hexafluoride tracer gas concentrations around a continuous mining machine. This mining machine was equipped with a flooded-bed dust scrubber and was positioned in the box or slab cut. Exhaust line brattice was used for all tests. Dust levels were measured in the return airway and at locations representing the operators of the continuous mining machine and the standard and off-standard shuttle cars. Increasing water pressure or using the underboom sprays produced no significant impacts on dust levels, although their interactions did produce some significant impacts. Increasing curtain setback distance often elevated dust levels, likely by {{reducing the amount of}} airflow reaching the face. Use of the <b>external</b> <b>sprays</b> created additional airflow around the mining machine that pushed the dust cloud past the scrubber inlets. This significantly increased dust levels at all sampling locations. Tracer gas levels were measured on the off-curtain and curtain sides of the cutter head and in the return airway. Increasing water pressure generally led to significantly increased gas levels on the curtain side, although a slight decrease was observed on the off-curtain side with the machine in the box cut. Increasing setback distance elevated gas levels {{on both sides of the}} cutter head and in the return by limiting the quantity of ventilation airflow reaching the face. Use of the <b>external</b> <b>sprays</b> provided additional airflow along the off-curtain side of the machine, significantly reducing gas levels in this region. These sprays adversely impacted the dilution and removal of gas on the curtain side of the cutter head. Use of the underboom sprays adversely impacted gas levels on both sides of the cutter head. Use of the <b>external</b> <b>sprays</b> provided the best control of respirable dust and face gas concentrations. The smaller increases in miner operator dust levels produced by these sprays were offset by larger reductions in face gas levels on the off-curtain side of the cutter head. Although the underboom sprays minimally impacted respirable dust levels, use of these sprays was not recommended because they increased face gas levels...|$|E

Nonetheless, research on spray breakup mechanism under low pressure in pharmaceutical industry is still relatively rare. Numerical model in the Lagrangian approach was modified for simulating the spray formation from a nasal spray device in the current study. The Linear Instability Sheet Atomization (LISA) was applied to model the formation of spray droplets of a continuous spray from a pressure swirl atomizer. The secondary breakup of spray droplets was simulated by the Taylor Analogy Breakup (TAB) model. Two way momentum coupling was applied to handle {{the interaction between the}} gas and liquid phases.

40|$|In Diesel engines, a {{key element}} in {{achieving}} a clean and efficient combustion process is a proper fuel-air mixing, which is a consequence of the fuel spray development and fuel-air interaction inside the engine combustion chamber. The spray structure and behavior are classically described by the length (penetration) and width (angle) of the spray plume but these parameters do not give any clue on the geometrical injection center and on the spray symmetry. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to find out original tools to characterize the Diesel spray: the virtual spray origin is the geometrical injection center, which may (or may not) coincide with the injector axis. Another interesting point is the description of the Diesel spray in terms of symmetry: the spray plume internal and external symmetry characterize the spray and the injector performance. Our approach is first to find out the virtual spray origin: after the image segmentation, the spray is coded with the Freeman code and with an original shape coding from which the moments are derived. The symmetry axes are then computed and the spray plumes are discarded (or not) for the virtual spray origin computation, which is derived from a Voronoi diagram.

These machine mounted dust control systems must be designed to function within the localized face ventilation system at the mining section to control both dust and methane. Spray systems can impede or improve the scrubber effectiveness in controlling dust or methane at the mining face. Laboratory experiments were conducted to {{examine the effect of}} spray type, spray pressure, machine body blocking sprays, and scrubber airflow on dust and gas levels while using a 12. 2 m (40 ft) exhaust ventilation curtain setback from the face.

40|$|Among {{the many}} factors that effect the {{atomization}} of a fuel spray in a com- bustion chamber, the flow {{characteristics of the}} fuel inside the injector nozzle play significant roles. The enthalpy of the entering fuel can be elevated such that it {{is higher than the}} local or downstream saturation enthalpy, which will result in the flash-boiling of the liquid. The phase change process dramatically effects the flow rate and has the potential to cause subsonic two-phase choking. The timescale over which this occurs is comparable to the flow-through time of the nozzle and hence any attempt to model this phenomenon needs to be done as a finite rate process. In the past the Homogeneous Relaxation Model (HRM) has been successfully employed to model the vaporization in one dimension. Here a full three dimensional imple- mentation of the HRM model is presented. Validations have been presented with experiments using water as working fluid. For the <b>external</b> <b>spray</b> modeling, where the fuel is said to be flash boiling, the phase change process plays a role alongside the aerodynamic breakup of the liquid and must be considered for obtaining the fuel spray characteristics. In this study the HRM model is coupled with Linearized Sheet Instability Analysis (LISA) model, for primary atomization, and with Taylor Analogy Breakup (TAB) model for secondary breakup. The aerodynamic breakup model and phase change based breakup model are designed as competing processes.

In this paper, internal and <b>external</b> <b>spray</b> characters are measured by high speed imaging along with sizing the residual droplets at {{the distance from the}} discharge orifice where the human oropharynx locates. Two different formulations with 95 % and 98 % mass fraction of HFA 134 a and two prototype cigarette alternatives with different expansion chamber volumes have been analyzed. The internal and external flows issuing from early stage prototype Oxette® are discussed along with boiling and evaporation phenomena. The expansion and entrainment regions of the jet are observed and discussed with comparison to the turbulent round jet of a single phase. From the visualizations of internal flows in the earlier design, a small expansion chamber can hardly generate small bubbles, which is difficult to produce fine sprays. The larger the expansion chamber volume, the more room for the propellant evaporation, recirculation, bubble generation and growth, all of which produces finer sprays. Therefore the later prototype of Oxette® 2 made a significant improvement to produce fine sprays and facilitated development of the cigarette alternative. Furthermore, the characters of the spray generated by Oxette® are compared to that issuing from a pMDI by previous researchers, where the residual MMD is larger than that of a pMDI, because the Oxette® has a smaller expansion chamber and the geometry provides less opportunity for the recirculation due to restrictions of the design space. Although the formulation with higher mass fraction of HFA 134 a can generate smaller droplets, it cannot produce steady puffs with relatively low mass flow rat...|$|R

In order to take all the advantages of the GDI technology, it is important to investigate in detail the interactions of fuel spray and combustion system, such as air-fuel mixing, in-cylinder flow development, surface wetting, and turbulence intensity. The characterizations of the internal nozzle flow of DI injector are first studied using the multidimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation. In the meanwhile the numerical and experimental studies are carried out to observe the <b>external</b> <b>spray</b> and wall impingements in an optical constant volume vessel.

Finally, the interactions of sprays with the charge motion are investigated in an optical accessible engine using CFD simulation and high-speed imaging of sprays inside engines. The numerical results DI injector nozzle show that the complicated unsteady flow features dominate the near-nozzle breakup mechanisms which are quite unlike those of diesel. The spray impingement, wetted area, fuel film thickness, and the resultant footprint mass were investigated experimentally. The CFD simulation with selected models of spray validated first for its transport in the air is used to compare the impingement models with the experimental measurements. The spray cone, tip penetration and fuel film shapes were in very good agreement. The effects of spray patterns, injection timing and flexible valve-train on the bulk flow motion and fuel-air mixing in an optical accessible engine, in terms of tumble and swirl ratios, turbulence level, and fuel wall film behaviors are discussed.

As a result of this production increase, control of respirable dust continues to be a problem. Therefore, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), Pittsburgh Health Technology Center, Dust Division, initiated a study to investigate the availability and adequacy of technology for controlling dust on longwal / mining operations.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the amount of <b>external</b> <b>spray</b> residues that accumulate on farm sprayers and tractors. Six different sprayers were examined, Airtec, conventional sprayer (three types of nozzles, TeeJet XR, Lurmark DriftBeta and Hardi Injet), Danfoil, Hardi Twin, Kyndestoft and Släpduk. The study does not include accidental spillage from supply tanks or leakage from pipes etc. that may occur in everyday practise. A tracer dye, Nigrosin WLF, was added to the spray liquid. After spraying the sprayer and tractor were washed over a catchment pool containing a fixed volume of water. A small centrifugal pump was used to re—circulate the water. The concentrations of Nigrosin in the rinse water and in the spray liquid were determined by using a spectrophotometer. By comparing these concentrations, the amount of Nigrosin immobilised on the tractor and sprayer was determined. The sprayer was divided into two areas that were rinsed separately, the booms and the tank (every part of the sprayer except for the booms). The tractor was also divided into two areas, the front (radiator, bonnet and engine) and the back (the rest). All wheels were excluded. An average of between 0, 01 % - 0, 60 % of the sprayed tracer dye (active substance) was found on the tractor and sprayer after spraying had been carried out. The largest accumulation, 50 - 98 % of the accumulated deposition, was observed on the booms. The largest deposition was observed on the air-assisted sprayers, Kyndestoft (0, 60 % of the sprayed amount) and Hardi Twin (0, 46 %). Släpduk received the third largest deposition (0, 36 %). 0, 06 % of the sprayed tracer dye was observed on Danfoil and Airtec. The deposition on the conventional sprayer with TeeJet XR nozzles was 0, 04 % and on the same sprayer with Lurmark DriftBeta 0, 02 %. Hardi lnjet nozzles mounted on the conventional sprayer gave a deposition of 0, 01 %.

The original TPS foam materials of the External Tank were blown with chlorofluorocarbon 11, which is now regulated because of its high Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP). Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), with an ODP that is one tenth that of CFCs, have been widely adopted as an interim blowing agent in urethane insulations.

40|$|This thesis has {{provided}} {{some insight into}} spray droplet formation after atomization of a drug formulation from a nasal spray device. A commercial nasal spray device was tested under a constant flow {{in order to better}} understand its spray formation and characteristics. External characteristics such as the spray cone angle define the range of spray that exits from the device, while the internal characteristics such as the droplet size distribution help to determine the probability of inertial impaction within the nasal cavity. The experimental method makes use of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle/droplet image analysis (PDIA) to obtain droplet diameters and spray velocities in different spray regions. Image processing techniques were applied to enhance visualization and a droplet concentration field. It was shown that there is some variation in the droplet diameters with respect to its radial and axial position from the spray orifice. Empirical curve fits for the particle size distribution were formulated to allow easier adoption of the data into CFD models. The dimensions of the <b>external</b> <b>spray</b> were shown to be much larger in comparison with the dimensions of a nasal cavity, which means that only a narrow portion of the spray will fit within the narrow cross sections of the nasal cavity. The results of another unsteady spray experiment using an in-house experimental test station to simulate the hand operations by patients have showed that there are three main phases of spray development (pre-stable, stable, and post-stable) that can be correlated by examining the spray width. A comparison with a human nasal cavity is made to put into perspective the dimensions and geometry that the spray atomization produces. The spray droplet size was analysed under different back pressures to mimic the drug delivery by adult and paediatric patients. It was found that the spray droplet size from the device operated by adult has smaller averaged Sauter mean diameter (SMD) which implies better drug absorption in nasal cavity. Also, the spray cone has less variation during stable stage. By prolonging the duration of this stage can improve the drug delivery performance and stability. The outcome has extended the current existing set of data to contribute toward a better understanding in nasal spray drug delivery. The numerical part of this thesis has presented the fine-tuned spray model constants of the linear instability sheet atomization model (LISA) and evaluated its performance for low pressure application. Some parameters that were evaluated include the dispersion angle and the liquid sheet constant that influences the droplet size distribution and dispersion. The simulation results were evaluated against experimental data that has been previously performed. It was found that the LISA model provided good comparisons when a dispersion angle of 3 ◦ and a liquid sheet constant of 1 were used. In addition, three scenarios were investigated: (i) influence of fluid droplet coupling; (ii) increase in mass flow rate; and (iii) changing the orientation from downward spray to upward spray...|$|R
40|$|Atomization of fuel is an {{important}} pre-requisite for efficient combustion in devices such as gas turbines, liquid propellant rocket engines, internal combustion engines and incinerators. The overall objective of the present work is to explore air-assisted atomization strategies for high viscosity fuels and liquids. Air-assisted atomization is a twin-fluid atomization method in which energy of the gas is used to assist the atomization of liquids. Broadly, three categories of air-assisted injection, i. e., effervescent, impinging jet and pre-filming air-blast are studied. Laser-based diagnostics are used to characterize the spray structure in terms of cone angle, penetration and drop size distribution. A backlit direct imaging method is used to study the macroscopic spray characteristics such as spray structure and spray cone angle while the microscopic characteristics are measured using the Particle/droplet imaging analysis (PDIA) technique. Effervescent atomization is a technique in which {{a small amount of}} gas is injected into the liquid at high pressure in the form of bubbles. Upon injection, the two-phase mixture expands rapidly and shatters the liquid into droplets and ligaments. Effervescent spray characteristics of viscous fuels such as Jatropha and Pongamia pure plant oils and diesel are studied. Measurements are made at various gas-to-liquid ratios (GLRs) and injection pressures. A Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of the order of 20 µm is achieved at an injection pressure of 10 bar and GLR of 0. 2 with viscous fuels. An image-based method is proposed and applied to evaluate the unsteadiness in the spray. A map indicating steady/unsteady regime of operation has been generated. An optically accessible injector tip is developed which has enabled visualization of the two-phase flow structure inside the exit orifice of the atomizer. An important contribution of the present work is the correlation of the two-phase flow regime in the orifice with the <b>external</b> <b>spray</b> structure. For viscous fuels, the spray is observed to be steady only in the annular two-phase flow regime. Unexpanded gas bubbles observed in the liquid core even at an injection pressure of 10 bar indicate that the bubbly flow regime may not be beneficial for high viscosity oils. A novel method of external mixing twin-fluid atomization is developed. In this method, two identical liquid jets impinging at an angle are atomized using a gas jet. The effect of liquid viscosity (1 cP to 39 cP) and surface tension (22 mN/m to 72 mN/m) on this mode of atomization is studied by using water-glycerol and water-ethanol mixtures, respectively. An SMD of the order of 40 µm is achieved for a viscosity of 39 cP at a GLR of 0. 13 at a liquid pressure of 8 bar and gas pressure of 5 bar. It is observed that the effect of liquid properties is minimal at high GLRs where the liquid jets are broken before the impingement as in the prompt atomization mode. Finally, a pre-filming air-blast technique is explored for transient spray applications. An SMD of 22 µm is obtained with diesel at liquid and gas pressures as low as 10 bar and 8. 5 bar, respectively. With this technique, an SMD of 44 µm is achieved for Jatropha oil having a viscosity 10 times higher than that of diesel...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} shearographic {{inspections}} {{of the test}} panels simulating the Space Shuttle's <b>external</b> tank (ET) <b>spray</b> on foam insulation (SOFI) are presented. Debonding of SOFI may introduce flight debris that may damage the orbiter's thermal protection system (TPS) exposing the orbiter (as well as the ET) to thermal loading. It is estimated that 90 percent of the TPS damage on the orbiter's 'belly' results from debonded SOFI during ascent. A series of test panels were fabricated, with programmed debonds of different geometries and sizes, to determine the sensitivity of shearography {{as a function of}} debond size, SOFI thickness,'and vacuum excitation. Results show that a Probability of Detection (POD) of 0. 95 or better can be expected for debonds with a diameter equal to the SOFI thickness as less than 0. 4 -psi pressure reduction. More testing will be required to validate the laser shearography imaging process for certifying its use in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of Space Shuttle space flight components...|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle Columbia's catastrophic {{accident}} {{emphasizes the}} growing need for developing and applying effective, robust and life-cycle oriented nondestructive testing (NDT) methods for inspecting the shuttle <b>external</b> fuel tank <b>spray</b> on foam insulation (SOFI) and its protective acreage heat tiles. Millimeter wave NDT techniques {{were one of}} the methods chosen for evaluating their potential for inspecting these structures. Several panels with embedded anomalies (mainly voids) were produced and tested for this purpose. Near-field and far-field millimeter wave NDT methods were used for producing millimeter wave images of the anomalies in SOFI panel and heat tiles. This paper presents the results of an investigation for the purpose of detecting localized anomalies in two SOFI panels and a set of heat tiles. To this end, reflectometers at a relatively wide range of frequencies (Ka-band (26. 5 - 40 GHz) to W-band (75 - 110 GHz)) and utilizing different types of radiators were employed. The results clearly illustrate the utility of these methods for this purpose...|$|R
5000|$|The {{industrial}} use of steam power started with Thomas Savery in 1698. He constructed and patented in London the first engine, {{which he called}} the [...] "Miner's Friend" [...] since he intended it to pump water from mines. This machine used steam at 8 to 10 atmospheres (120-150 psi) and had no moving parts other than hand-operated valves. The steam once admitted into the cylinder was first condensed by an <b>external</b> cold water <b>spray,</b> thus creating a partial vacuum which drew water up through a pipe from a lower level; then valves were opened and closed and a fresh charge of steam applied directly on {{to the surface of}} the water now in the cylinder, forcing it up an outlet pipe discharging at higher level. The engine was used as a low-lift water pump in a few mines and numerous water works, but it was not a success since it was limited in pumping height and prone to boiler explosions.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the properties of flame sprayed ceramic coatings using oxide ceramic materials coating of a powdered aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3) matrix with 3 % titanium oxide (TiO 2) applied to unalloyed S 235 JR grade structural steel. A primer consisting of a metallic Ni-Al-Mo based powder has been applied to plates with dimensions of 5 × 200 × 300 mm and front surfaces of Ø 40 × 50 mm cylinders. Flame spraying of primer coating was made using a RotoTec 80 torch, and an external coating was made with a CastoDyn DS 8000 torch. Evaluation of the coating properties was conducted using metallographic testing, phase composition research, measurement of microhardness, substrate coating adhesion (acc. to EN 582 : 1996 standard), erosion wear resistance (acc. to ASTM G 76 - 95 standard), and abrasive wear resistance (acc. to ASTM G 65 standard) and thermal impact. The testing performed has demonstrated that flame spraying with 97 % Al 2 O 3 powder containing 3 % TiO 2 performed in a range of parameters allows for obtaining high-quality ceramic coatings with thickness up to ca. 500 µm on a steel base. Spray coating possesses a structure consisting mainly of aluminium oxide and a small amount of NiAl 10 O 16 and NiAl 32 O 49 phases. The bonding primer coat sprayed with the Ni-Al-Mo powder to the steel substrate and <b>external</b> coating <b>sprayed</b> with the 97 % Al 2 O 3 powder with 3 % TiO 2 addition demonstrates mechanical bonding characteristics. The coating is characterized by a high adhesion to the base amounting to 6. 5 MPa. Average hardness of the external coating is ca. 780 HV. The obtained coatings are characterized by high erosion and abrasive wear resistance and the resistance to effects of cyclic thermal shock...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Terahertz (THz) imaging {{is being}} adopted for {{non-destructive}} evaluation (NDE) applications in aerospace {{and other government}} and industrial settings [1 - 3]. NASA is currently employing THz reflection NDE to examine the space shuttle <b>external</b> tank <b>sprayed</b> on foam insulation (SOFI) for voids and disbonds. Homeland security applications such as the inspection of personnel[2], the detection of concealed explosives[2], biological agents, chemical weapons, flammables, metallic and non-metallic weapons, and other potentially dangerous items {{are the subject of}} active investigation. Advancement of many of these application beyond small table top experimentation had been limited by slow imaging speed (tens of minutes or hours), small scan areas (< 10 square cm) and in many cases the requirement that the sample itself be mechanically raster scanned. We report the development and applications of a high speed large area time domain terahertz non destructive evaluation imaging system. 1. 0 Terahertz Imaging Instrumentation The Picometrix QA- 1000 terahertz imaging setup, as utilized for images shown below, is shown Fig. 1. The system consists of a rack mounted control unit containing a femtosecond laser, fiber launch, 320 ps / 100 Hz optical delay, signal processing, motion control and image analysis computer. A 5 meter fiber-optic and electrical umbilical cord attaches the terahertz transmitters and receivers mounted on an overhead gantry with 1. 0 m by 1. 0 m scanning range. The fiber optic coupling enables the scanning of the transmitter and receivers, allowing for a stationary object. In reflection, the co-linear transceiver has a 30 cm working distance, bringing the THz pulse to a 2 mm focus. In transmission, a “C” shaped yoke holds the transmitter and receiver above and below the object, respectively. Up to a 30 cm thick objects may be imaged in transmission, with the focusing lenses achieving a similar 2 mm spot. Both the reflection transceiver or transmission “C ” yoke can be moved vertically up to 30 cm to achieve the best focus. 1 Fig. 1 Larg...|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle Columbia's {{catastrophic failure}} {{is thought to}} have been caused by a {{dislodged}} piece of <b>external</b> tank SOFI (<b>Spray</b> On Foam Insulation) striking the left wing of the orbiter causing significant damage to some of the reinforced carbodcarbon leading edge wing panels. Microwave and millimeter wave nondestructive evaluation methods, have shown great potential for inspecting the SOFI for the purpose of detecting anomalies such as small voids that may cause separation of the foam from the external tank during the launch. These methods are capable of producing relatively high-resolution images of the interior of SOH particularly when advanced imaging algorithms are incorporated into the overall system. To this end, synthetic aperture focusing techniques are being deveioped for this purpose. These iechniqiies pradiice high-resolution images that are independent of the distance of the imaging probe to the SOFI with spatial resolution in the order of the half size of imaging probe aperture. At microwave and millimeter wave frequencies these apertures are inherently small resulting in high-resolution images. This paper provides the results of this investigation using 2 D and 3 D SAF based methods and holography. The attributes of these methods and a full discussion of the results will also be provided...|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle Columbia's {{catastrophic failure}} has been {{attributed}} to a piece of <b>external</b> tank SOFI (<b>Spray</b> On Foam Insulation) striking the left wing of the orbiter causing significant damage to some of the reinforced carbon/carbon leading edge wing panels. Subsequently, several nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques have been considered for inspecting the external tank. One such method involves using millimeter waves which have been shown to easily penetrate through the foam and provide high resolution images of its interior structures. This paper presents the results of inspecting three different SOFI covered panels by reflectometers at millimeter wave frequencies, specifically at 100 GHz. Each panel was fitted with various embedded anomalies/inserts representing voids and unbonds of diferent shapes, sizes and locations within each panel. In conjunction with these reJqectome&rs, radiators including a focused lens antenna and a small horn antenna were used. The focused lens antenna provided for a footprint diameter of approximately 1. 25 cm (0. 5 ") at 25. 4 cm (10 ") away from the lens surface. The horn antenna was primarily operated in its near-field for obtaining relatively high resolution images. These images were produced using 2 0 scanning mechanisms. Discussions of the difference between the capabilities of these two types of antennas (radiators) for the purpose of inspecting the SOFI {{as it relates to the}} produced images are also presented...|$|R
