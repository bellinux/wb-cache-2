The methods relay on a quasi-dynamic pricing function for unit of energy consumed, which comprises of a base price and a penalty term.

40|$|A {{wide-body}} {{of empirical}} and experimental research on recognising and explaining the behaviour of household <b>energy</b> <b>bill</b> payers suggests that household <b>energy</b> <b>bill</b> payers {{do not always}} abide by the postulation of having unchanging preferences.

For an explanation for why this decrease in energy consumption occurs, this thesis takes the stance that preferences are malleable and context-dependent and, at times, endogenous. To broaden the research on endogenous preferences in the explanation of household <b>energy</b> <b>bill</b> payers related behaviour, I champion a social preference extension strategy that allows context-dependent preferences to complement the behaviour of household <b>energy</b> <b>bill</b> payers by attaching the social preference extension strategy to rational choice theory.

40|$|Contrary to expectations, the {{development}} of smart (mini) grids is slow. Due to drastic improvements in innovative technologies, the reasons are not strictly technical but the problem mainly lies in regulatory barriers. The current business models are centric to utilities rather than customers. Net metering is a key enabling factor for smart (mini) grids. This paper addresses the economic benefits of net metering for individual residential customers. Energy demand for the individual apartments and common areas is calculated using the daily energy consumption behavior of occupants for typical days of each month of the year. Photovoltaic generation is estimated via PVGIS for a residential building in Italy.

40|$|Holistic view of {{household}} energy consumption based on {{greenhouse gas emissions}} in the North Central cities of Nigeria was examined in this study. Scenarios considered were based on income level of energy users (low and high) and energy metering system (i. e. pre-paid and post-paid <b>energy</b> <b>billing</b> systems). Strong direct nexus was observed between energy use and emissions pattern. Energy utilization by post-paid category had higher weekly average value of 35. 09 and 41. 70 kWh as against 23. 18 and 33. 38 kWh for low and high income pre-paid consumers respectively. Energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from both classification followed similar trend. Data obtained and analysed in the study show that global warming and acidification potentials could be reduced by 33. 94 and 19. 95 % for low and high income category consumers when pre-paid meters are in place. Conclusively, energy system users with pre-paid metering system displayed reasonable level of management decisions that reduce energy wastage and consequently environmental negative impacts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Technological {{improvements}} and energy exchange between and within electrical systems require more availability and reliability, {{and the use}} of communication channels and measuring devices helps to achieve this goal. Coupling Capacitor Voltage Transformers (CCVTs) traditionally have been essential for power systems communications using Power Line Carrier (PLC), and its design normally includes a protection to prevent ferroresonance phenomenon. However, CCVTs failures due to environmental conditions and their lack of accuracy for <b>energy</b> <b>billing</b> led some electrical companies like the Mexican company Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) to gradual replacement of CCVT devices by the Inductive Voltage Transformers (IVT), which are installed now in busbars of electrical substations. In addition to satisfy communications PLCs were replaced by the optical fiber communications. As IVT devices do not have anti ferroresonance elements, ferroresonance phenomenon started to appear more frequently during operation maneuvers in several electrical substations. This paper presents background on CCVT explosions, patterns of behavior before failures, Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) records for system effects, measurements and simulation of typical ferroresonance occurrences. Ferroresonance mitigation techniques and possible protection schemes are also discussed...|$|E
