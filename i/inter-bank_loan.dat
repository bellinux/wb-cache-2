50|$|On 12 February 2009, {{details of}} a further {{controversial}} transaction which {{had the effect of}} misrepresenting the end-of-year accounts of Anglo-Irish Bank came into the public domain. Anglo-Irish Bank lent €4bn to Irish Life & Permanent (IL&P) for 1 day by way of <b>inter-bank</b> <b>loan,</b> and a subsidiary of Irish Life placed a deposit of a similar amount with Anglo, which was recorded as a customer deposit. Following a discussion with the Minister for Finance, a board meeting of IL&P accepted the resignation of two senior IL&P executives.|$|E
50|$|The {{emergence}} of sub-prime loan losses in 2007 began {{the crisis and}} exposed other risky loans and over-inflated asset prices. With loan losses mounting and the fall of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008, a major panic broke out on the <b>inter-bank</b> <b>loan</b> market. There {{was the equivalent of}} a bank run on the shadow banking system, resulting in many large and well established investment and commercial banks in the United States and Europe suffering huge losses and even facing bankruptcy, resulting in massive public financial assistance (government bailouts).|$|E
40|$|Using {{alternative}} measures of term lending rates and counterparty risk {{and a wide}} variety of econometric specifications, we find that counterparty risk has a robust significant effect on interest rate spreads in the term <b>inter-bank</b> <b>loan</b> markets. In contrast, we do not find comparably robust evidence of significant negative effects of the Fed’s term auction facility (TAF) on term lending rates. This analysis incorporates the latest data from the ongoing turmoil in the money markets and confirms earlier findings reported in Taylor and Williams (2008). The views expressed in this paper are solely those of the authors and should not be interpreted as reflecting the views of the management of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco or the Board o...|$|E
50|$|Raising {{the federal}} funds rate will dissuade banks from taking out such <b>inter-bank</b> <b>loans,</b> which in turn will make cash that much harder to procure. Conversely, {{dropping}} the interest rates will encourage banks to borrow money and therefore invest more freely. This interest rate {{is used as a}} regulatory tool to control how freely the U.S. economy operates.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} inter-bank lending {{relationships}} have an ambiguous effect on financial stability. Studies {{have shown that}} fewer <b>inter-bank</b> <b>loans</b> limit the spread of bankruptcies whilst other work has argued that greater connectivity aids risk sharing. In this paper we identify {{the conditions under which}} each relationship holds. Using numerical techniques we demonstrate that in response to a large economy-wide shock, higher numbers of inter-bank lending relationships worsen the impact of the event, however, for smaller shocks the opposite relationship is observed. As such there is no optimal inter-bank market structure which reduces contagion under all economic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Financial crises are {{associated}} with reduced volumes and extreme levels of rates for term <b>inter-bank</b> <b>loans,</b> reflected in the one-month and three-month Libor. We explain such stress by modeling leveraged banks' precautionary demand for liquidity. Asset shocks impair a bank's ability to roll over debt because of agency problems associated with high leverage. In turn, banks hoard liquidity and decrease term lending as their rollover risk increases over the term of the loan. High levels of short-term leverage and illiquidity of assets lead to low volumes and high rates for term borrowing. In extremis, inter-bank markets can completely freeze...|$|R
40|$|In this article, we {{assess the}} extent of {{contagion}} by examining international loan flows by banks reporting to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). We find that contagion in the international loan market is not systematic or global in nature; rather it is limited to specific borrowing groups or geographic regions. While increased correlations among loan flows (contagion) are evident during periods of crisis for East Asian countries, such is generally {{not the case for}} Latin American countries. We also find that sharp reductions in loan flows to the countries during the crisis period are often unrelated to the economic growth of the countries over that time. 1 Loan Flows, Contagion Effects, and East Asian Crisis Among the debates that regained interest after the East Asian financial crisis is the one concerning "contagion". The financial crises that followed the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 subsequently spread to other countries in East Asia. 1 Undisciplined foreign lending and volatility in the <b>inter-bank</b> <b>loan</b> market aggravated the inherent weaknesses of these countries, such as overvalued currencies and inflated asse...|$|E
40|$|Research in {{the domain}} of Financial Contagion has come to the {{forefront}} in recent years. There has been a significant focus on this field since the recession of 2008. In this paper {{we take a look at}} simulation based modelling to stress test the stability of <b>inter-bank</b> <b>loan</b> networks of different structures. We look to analyze the effect of various parameters on the stability of these networks. We first simulate networks which are Homogeneous in nature. We then simulate a Heterogeneous (tiered) network. The model also introduces an endogenous loaning mechanism to imitate a more realistic inter bank loan market. We run simulations on these networks to gain a better understanding of the propagation of losses through the network. After studying the results of these simulations we come up with some interesting new insights about how parameters like connectivity and size of the network, effect a tiered intra-bank financial network. One of our key findings is that higher inter-tier connectivity is good for the stability of big banks but not so much for banks of smaller size...|$|E
3000|$|Standard {{economic}} textbooks {{describe the}} recipe against {{the financial crisis}} which emerged in late 2008 as follows: internationally coordinated flooding of money, low interest rates, a guarantee on <b>inter-bank</b> <b>loans</b> and saving accounts, restructuring of management, fresh public equity capital via a temporary nationalization of banks, relieving ailing banks from toxic assets by transferring these assets into publicly sponsored work-out units (so-called “bad banks”), and establishing a new international financial regime. Such reactions happened, but rather slowly and only gradually. In particular, there was no internationally coordinated comprehensive approach, especially not with respect to toxic assets and the reorganization of the financial regime. 4 [...]...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} liquidity transfers between banks {{through the}} inter-bank borrowing and asset sale markets when banks providing liquidity may have market power and assets may be bank-specific. We show {{that when the}} outside options of liquidity-affected banks are weak, surplus banks may act strategically by charging higher than competitive interest rates on <b>inter-bank</b> <b>loans</b> and thereby induce more asset sales. This failure {{in the market for}} liquidity transfers is associated with an inefficiency in the allocation of specific assets. A regulator such as a Central Bank can ameliorate this inefficiency by standing to lend to affected banks at competitive rates. The public provision of liquidity to banks, or its mere credibility, can thus improve the private allocation of liquidity among banks. This rationale for the existence of a Central Bank finds support in historical episodes preceding the modern era of Central Banking...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the determinants of}} the interest rate of short-term unsecured <b>loan</b> <b>inter-bank</b> market (call) in Argentina. The {{results show that the}} heterogeneous nature of the entities, in terms of size and origin of ownership, impacts on the interest rate agreed. Other additional aspects, such as the linkages between entities and the degree of supply or demand concentration, also affect the cost of funding. The structure of the market and the repo rates established by the BCRA are also relevant. Finally, the interest rate reacts positively when banks have a higher demand for liquidity, due to both seasonality and episodes of reduction in deposits...|$|R
40|$|Customers’ {{knowledge}} {{is the most}} critical factor {{for the success of}} electronic banking. Other than that, the success of the banking institution operations is also influenced by the human factors, like a sense of confidence, knowledge, security, and the strength of the banking institution. The routine activities like savings, bill settlements and credit transfers can be done in the most efficient manner nowadays compared to the old system. Most banks introduce the Internet banking system as an advantage to the customers, whereby they need not have to come to the bank premises to settle their bills. This is a relatively unexamined area of investigation that concerns customers’ knowledge towards Internet banking launched by the banking institutions. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the customers’ understanding of the term ‘internet banking’ and how they experience this service. This paper will also try to identify the factors influencing their knowledge towards Internet banking. This paper will provide suggestions to the banking institutions on how to implement this Internet banking in the most efficient way in term of gaining the high quality Internet banking services. This research was carried out qualitatively. Selected customers from the various government departments were interviewed and their responses were recorded, transcribed, interpreted, and analysed based on the theme(s) of the research. Data were collected through an in-depth, open-ended interview method. The criteria for selecting the participants are their educations, occupations, ages, and their gender. Participants were 10 government officers in the various departments in Dungun, Terengganu. This research found that generally most of the participants understand the concept of internet banking. The sources of their knowledge are from banks, work experiences, friends, readings, and promotional activities through advertisements. Most of them have experiences of using IB for bill payment, <b>Inter-bank</b> Fund Transfer, <b>Loan</b> Payment, Balance Enquiry, credit card payment and also checking the summary of payments...|$|R
