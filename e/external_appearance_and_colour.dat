(2003) [...] used {{a combination of}} genetic and morphological analyses to identify four further specimens, including a complete adult female with a fetus found in the Maldives in January 2000. The other remains consisted of a skull from Kenya collected some time before 1968, and two juvenile males from South Africa from strandings in 1976 and 1992, respectively. Based on morphological analyses, Dalebout et al. (2003) concluded that the genus Indopacetus was a valid one. The <b>external</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>and</b> <b>colour</b> pattern of this species was also revealed, and a firm connection was established with the mysterious tropical bottlenose whales that had been sighted in the Indian and Pacific Oceans since the 1960s. While this paper was in press, a specimen that was first mis-identified as a Baird's beaked whale washed up in Kagoshima, Japan in July 2002.|$|E
40|$|In {{developing}} instrumentation for {{the measurement}} of fruit quality, there {{is the need for}} fast and non-destructive devices, based on sensors, to be installed on-line. In the case of some fruits, like peaches, post-harvest ripeness, which is closely related to high quality for the consumer, is a priority. During ripening, <b>external</b> <b>appearance</b> (<b>colour)</b> <b>and</b> internal mechanical (firmness) and chemical (sugars and acids) quality are main features that evolve rapidly from and unripe to a ripe (high quality) stage. When considering the evolution of fruit quality in this scheme, external <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> firmness are shown to evolve in a parallel pattern, if monitored from the time of harvest to full consumer ripeness (Rood, 1957; Crisosto et al, 1995; Kader, 1996). The visible (VIS) reflectance spectrum is a fast and easy reference {{that can be used to}} estimate quality of peaches, if we could show it to be reliably correlated with peach ripening rate during postharvest (Genard et al. 1994; Moras, 1995; Delwiche and Baumgartner, 1983; Delwiche et al. 1987; Slaughter, 1995; Lleo et al., 1998). Taste, described as an expert acceptance score, improves with ripeness (firmness <b>and</b> <b>colour</b> evolution), when considering the fruits on the tree, and also post-harvest...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Herby {{cheese is}} a salted {{traditional}} cheese manufactured from sheep’s and cow’s milk in the Eastern and South-eastern of Turkey. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the influence of different salt concentrations (4, 5 and 6 %) on the ripening characteristics of Herby cheese. Pasteurized whole cow's milk (3. 7 % fat) was used for Herby cheese manufacture. The cheese samples were ripened under soil at 7 ± 1 C o for 90 days. The samples were characterized in terms of microbiological, chemical and sensory properties. The ripening time had a significant (P< 0. 05) effect on all parameters except for protein, fat, total aerobic bacteria (TAB), <b>appearance</b> <b>and</b> <b>colour,</b> body <b>and</b> texture, and flavour. In addition, salt concentration had a significant influence on dry matter, salt, titratable acidity, micrococci and staphylococci, proteolytic bacteria, yeasts <b>and</b> moulds, <b>appearance</b> <b>and</b> <b>colour,</b> <b>and</b> saltiness. As a result, we concluded that increasing the salt concentration in cheese samples contributed to reducing the number of microorganisms and increased the acceptability in terms of <b>appearance</b> <b>and</b> <b>colour,</b> <b>and</b> body and texture from sensory properties...|$|R

The experiment was installed in a complete randomized desing in a 3 x 4 factorial scheme (doses x extracts). For the evaluation, it was calculated the percentage of fungal inhibition. The experiment in vivo was conducted by applying Syzy- gium aromaticum and Azadirachta indica aqueous extract at 2 and 3 %, respectively, in three different storage conditions: refrigerated with and without plastic film (PVC), and at ambient conditions. The experiment was installed in a completely randomized design, in a 2 x 3 factorial scheme (extracts x storage conditions). We evaluated the <b>external</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>and</b> severity of disease, loss of weight and Brix degrees.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the kind and importance of factors influencing the choice of vegetables and fruit consumed by the youth. The research was carried out on youth group aged 15 — 16. The group consisted of 966 pupils, including 483 girls and 483 boys, living in Szczecin. They were selected for the research in two steps, in groups. Fourteen choice factors of raw vegetables and fruit, without separating their assortment, were examined, with the use of a test based on a 3 -point hedonic scale. Between girls and boys no differentiation in the choice factors ranking according to their importance was stated, both in the vegetables and fruit choice. Factors to a great degree taken into account by the youth included: freshness, taste, stability, influence on health, <b>external</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>and</b> nutritional value. In girls group, in comparison to boys, the vegetables choice was significantly more strongly determined by such factors as influence on health, <b>external</b> <b>appearance,</b> nutritional value <b>and</b> habit, and the fruit choice by <b>external</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>and</b> influence on health. Sex of pupils influenced some factors importance degree, independently from their parents education.
