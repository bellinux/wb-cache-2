5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances <b>image</b> <b>contrast</b> in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to using a Bucky-Potter grid, increasing the ODD alone can improve <b>image</b> <b>contrast</b> by decreasing {{the amount of}} scattered radiation that reaches the receptor.

25|$|A {{study by}} the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) {{presented}} at the 2013 EUVL Workshop indicated that, {{as a measure of}} EUV photoelectron and secondary electron blur, 50–100 eV electrons easily penetrated beyond 15nm of resist thickness (PMMA or commercial resist), indicating more than 30nm range of resist affected centered on the EUV point of absorption, for doses exceeding 200–300 uC/cm2.

30|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) imaging is {{well known}} for its noninvasiveness and abundance of <b>image</b> <b>contrasts.</b> Conventional MR imaging contrasts are based on the spin relaxation rates of different body tissues under a static magnetic field and various radiofrequency (RF) pulses. Commonly encountered contrasts include T 1, T 2, proton density (PD), and T 2 * [1]. The search for novel <b>image</b> <b>contrasts</b> has been the ever-existing driving force in the MR research community, in order to gain further information on the body’s physiological and pathological conditions. Novel <b>image</b> <b>contrasts</b> have been developed by exploiting different aspects: physical or structural properties (diffusion-weighted imaging [2 – 4], MR elastography [5, 6], etc.); functional properties (perfusion [7, 8], BOLD [9, 10], resting state fMRI [11, 12], etc.); and chemical composition (MR spectroscopy [13, 14], chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) [15 – 22], etc.).|$|R

25|$|At lower magnifications TEM <b>image</b> <b>contrast</b> {{is due to}} {{differential}} absorption of electrons by the material {{due to differences in}} composition or thickness of the material. At higher magnifications complex wave interactions modulate the intensity of the image, requiring expert analysis of observed images. Alternate modes of use allow for the TEM to observe modulations in chemical identity, crystal orientation, electronic structure and sample induced electron phase shift as well as the regular absorption based imaging.|$|E
25|$|Generally spoken, the <b>image</b> <b>contrast</b> {{provided}} by {{this method is}} lower than of other methods discussed here, especially if the density variations in the sample are small. Due to its strength in enhancing the contrast at boundaries, it's well suited for imaging fiber or foam samples. A very important application of PBI is the examination of fossils with synchrotron radiation, which reveals details about the paleontological specimens which would otherwise be inaccessible without destroying the sample.|$|E
25|$|The {{goals of}} tone mapping can be {{differently}} stated {{depending on the}} particular application.

25|$|Dark field {{microscopy}} is {{a technique}} for improving the contrast of unstained, transparent specimens. Dark field illumination uses a carefully aligned light source to minimize the quantity of directly transmitted (unscattered) light entering the image plane, collecting only the light scattered by the sample. Dark field can dramatically improve <b>image</b> <b>contrast</b> – especially of transparent objects – while requiring little equipment setup or sample preparation. However, the technique suffers from low light intensity in final image of many biological samples {{and continues to be}} affected by low apparent resolution.|$|E
25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of the {{transmission electron microscope}} {{is the need for}} extremely thin sections of the specimens, typically about 100 nanometers. Creating these thin sections for biological and materials specimens is technically very challenging. Semiconductor thin sections can be made using a focused ion beam. Biological tissue specimens are chemically fixed, dehydrated and embedded in a polymer resin to stabilize them sufficiently to allow ultrathin sectioning. Sections of biological specimens, organic polymers and similar materials may require staining with heavy atom labels in order to achieve the required <b>image</b> <b>contrast.</b>|$|E
25|$|Computer graphic {{techniques}} {{capable of}} rendering high-contrast scenes shifted the focus from color to luminance {{as the main}} limiting factor of display devices. Several tone mapping operators were developed to map high dynamic range (HDR) images to standard displays. More recently, this work has branched away from utilizing luminance to extend <b>image</b> <b>contrast</b> and towards other methods such as user-assisted image reproduction. Currently, image reproduction has shifted towards display-driven solutions since displays now possess advanced image processing algorithms that help adapt rendering of the image to viewing conditions, save power, up-scale color gamut and dynamic range.|$|E

25|$|An {{even more}} {{sophisticated}} group of tone mapping algorithms {{is based on}} contrast or gradient domain methods, which are 'local'. Such operators concentrate on preserving contrast between neighboring regions rather than absolute value, an approach motivated {{by the fact that}} the human perception is most sensitive to contrast in images rather than absolute intensities. Those tone mapping methods usually produce very sharp images, which preserve very well small contrast details; however, this is often done at the cost of flattening an overall <b>image</b> <b>contrast,</b> and may as a side effect produce halo-like glows around dark objects. Examples of such tone mapping methods include: gradient domain high dynamic range compression and A Perceptual Framework for Contrast Processing of High Dynamic Range Images (a tone mapping is one of the applications of this framework).|$|E
2500|$|The <b>image</b> <b>contrast</b> {{is related}} to the sample's {{absorption}} coefficient [...] This is in contrast to bright or dark field microscopy, where the <b>image</b> <b>contrast</b> is due to transmittance or scattering. In principle, the contrast of fluorescence microscopy is proportional to the sample's absorption too.

The AFM tip is used to detect the ultrasonic waves and overcomes the limitation of wavelength that occurs in acoustic microscopy. By using the elastic changes under the AFM tip, an image of much greater detail than the AFM topography can be generated.|$|E

2500|$|A {{low-voltage}} {{electron microscope}} (LVEM) is operated at relatively low electron accelerating voltage between 5–25 kV. Some of {{these can be}} a [...] combination of SEM, TEM and STEM in a single compact instrument. Low voltage increases <b>image</b> <b>contrast</b> which {{is especially important for}} biological specimens. This increase in contrast significantly reduces, or even eliminates the need to stain. Resolutions of a few nm are possible in TEM, SEM and STEM modes. The low energy of the electron beam means that permanent magnets can be used as lenses and thus a miniature column that does not require cooling can be used.|$|E
2500|$|Visible {{light can}} be seen by the naked eye (and thus forms images that people can look at), but it does not {{penetrate}} most objects (only translucent ones). In contrast, X-rays can penetrate a wider variety of objects (such as the human body), but they are invisible to the naked eye. To take advantage of the penetration for image-forming purposes, one must somehow convert the X-rays' intensity variations (which correspond to material contrast and thus <b>image</b> <b>contrast)</b> into a form that is visible. Classic film-based radiography achieves this by the variable chemical changes that the X-rays induce in the film, and classic fluoroscopy achieves it by fluorescence, in which certain materials convert X-ray energy (or other parts of the spectrum) into visible light. This use of fluorescent materials to make a [...] is how fluoroscopy got its name.|$|E
2500|$|A key {{challenge}} for EUV is the counter-scaling {{behavior of the}} line tip-to-tip (T2T) distance [...] as half-pitch (hp) is scaled down. This is {{in part due to}} lower <b>image</b> <b>contrast</b> for the binary masks used in EUV lithography, which is not encountered with the use of phase shift masks in immersion lithography. The rounding of the corners of the line end leads to line end shortening, and this is worse for binary masks. The use of phase-shift masks in EUV lithography has been studied but encounters difficulties from phase control in thin layers as well as the bandwidth of the EUV light itself. More conventionally, optical proximity correction (OPC) is used to address the corner rounding and line-end shortening. In spite of this, {{it has been shown that}} the tip-to-tip resolution and the line tip printability are traded off against each other, being effectively CDs of opposite polarity. In addition, the effectiveness of optical corrections depends on other non-optical causes such as resist blur and diffusion effects, which may also include secondary electron blur (discussed in the section on photoresist exposure). Also, larger molecular weights and sizes appear to reduce corner rounding.|$|E

2500|$|The term {{infrared}} microscopy {{refers to}} microscopy performed at infrared wavelengths. In the typical instrument configuration a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) {{is combined with}} an optical microscope and an infrared detector. [...] The infrared detector can be a single point detector, a linear array or a 2D focal plane array. [...] The FTIR provides the ability to perform chemical analysis via infrared spectroscopy and the microscope and point or array detector enable this chemical analysis to be spatially resolved, i.e. performed at {{different regions of the}} sample. As such, the technique is also called infrared microspectroscopy [...] (an alternative architecture involves the combination of a tuneable infrared light source and single point detector on a flying objective). This technique is frequently used for infrared chemical imaging, where the <b>image</b> <b>contrast</b> is determined by the response of individual sample regions to particular IR wavelengths selected by the user, usually specific IR absorption bands and associated molecular resonances [...] A key limitation of conventional infrared microspectroscopy is that the spatial resolution is diffraction-limited. [...] Specifically the spatial resolution is limited to a figure related to the wavelength of the light. [...] For practical IR microscopes, the spatial resolution is limited to 1-3X the wavelength, depending on the specific technique and instrument used. [...] For mid-IR wavelengths, this sets a practical spatial resolution limit of ~3-30 μm.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{considering}} {{the resolution of}} the optics, one must also maximize visibility by maximizing <b>image</b> <b>contrast.</b> A microscope with excellent resolution {{may not be able to}} image a structure, that is there is no visibility, if <b>image</b> <b>contrast</b> is poor. <b>Image</b> <b>contrast</b> depends upon the quality of the optics, coatings on the lenses, and reduction of flare and glare; but, it also requires proper specimen preparation and good etching techniques. So, obtaining good images requires maximum resolution and <b>image</b> <b>contrast.</b>|$|E
50|$|This formula {{gives the}} best-case {{resolution}} performance and is valid only for perfect optical systems.
