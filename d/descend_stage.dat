Considering the {{confining}} {{mechanism in}} circular concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns, a volume-based method for dividing the effectively and ineffectively confined area of concrete core and calculating {{the value of}} effectively confined coefficient is presented. The constitutive relationship of concrete core is developed by means of modifying the expressions of effective lateral pressure and the <b>descending</b> <b>stage</b> in Mander’s confined concrete model. Numerical simulation of several circular CFST columns under axial load is carried out in ABAQUS.

40|$|A {{modified}} log-type creep model without hysteresis of {{the stack}} piezoelectric actuator is presented. For high-speed micro-/nanopositioning system, the time scale should be less than one second for creep modeling and control in the stack piezoelectric actuator. But creep effect was studied {{in the frame of}} minutes in previous works. Meanwhile, parameters of the classical creep models are hard to be determined. By the proposed model, the hysteresis and the creep effect can be separated. A series of experiments have been performed, where different staircase voltages have been applied to the actuator. There are two clear rules to follow in small duration and different heights to determine parameters. Firstly, L 0 starts from fixed point either in ascending <b>stage</b> or in <b>descending</b> <b>stage</b> and rotates clockwise.

30|$|We {{concentrate}} on the image formation during the missile <b>descending</b> <b>stage.</b> An image formation algorithm for the missile-borne circular-scanning SAR is proposed. A processed aperture time {{is defined as the}} time during which the antenna beam rotates 360 degrees. The processed aperture is divided into many subapertures, the signal of which is processed by using the principle of the polar format algorithm (PFA) [1, 2]. Each subaperture is used to form a SAR image, named subimage. The focus algorithm is generalized to form each subimage when the antenna beam scans at an arbitrary position. A geometric-distortion correction method is proposed. It corrects target locations by using 2 -D interpolation in image domain. This method can work even in the case of high maneuvering. The successive subimages are mosaicked together to form a circular image. Compared with the existing algorithms of the circular-scanning SAR, the proposed algorithm does not need to increase the sampling rate and memory storage when the squint angle increases. Meanwhile, there is no extra computation to motion compensation since it is included in the subimage focusing algorithm.|$|R

40|$|The Poly(vinylidene) {{fluoride}} (PVDF) {{thin films}} {{with a high}} content of β-phase were prepared by controlling heat-treatment temperature using casting from the poled solvents. The crystallite microstructure of thin films was depicted by the techniques of X-ray diffraction and FTIR. The results showed that heat treatment was favorable for inducing the β- and γ-phase formation of PVDF. The β phase films were obtained with heat treatment at temperatures ranging from 60 °C to 120 °C and annealing at 120 °C after casting from DMF. The thermo-optical effect of β phase PVDF films was investigated using a spectroscopic ellipsometer. At temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 100 °C, the refractive index of PVDF was negatively correlated with the temperature between 350 and 1500 nm. The value of the t. o. coefficient of PVDF films was calculated at all temperatures. The maximum value of the t. o. coefficient was about 3. 3 × 10 - 4 /°C at the ascending stage of temperature and 3. 0 × 10 - 4 /°C at the <b>descending</b> <b>stage</b> of temperature.

40|$|Patients with kidney {{replacement}} exhibit disrupted circadian rhythms. Most studies measuring {{blood pressure}} use the dipper/non-dipper classification, {{which does not}} consider analysis of transitional stages between low and high blood pressure, confidence intervals nor shifts {{in the time of}} peak, while assuming subjective onsets of night and day phases. In order to better understand the nature of daily variation of blood pressure in these patients, we analyzed 24 [*]h recordings from 41 renal transplant recipients using the non-symmetrical double-logistic fitting assessment which does not assume abruptness nor symmetry in ascending and <b>descending</b> <b>stages</b> of the blood pressure profile, and a cosine best-fitting regression method (Cosinor). Compared with matched controls, double-logistic fitting showed that the times for most transitional stages (ascending systolic and descending systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure) had a wider distribution along the 24 -h. The proportion of individuals without daily blood pressure rhythm in the transplanted group was larger only for systolic arterial pressure, and the amplitude showed no significant difference. Furthermore, the transplant recipient group had a less pronounced slope in descending systolic and ascending mean blood pressure. Cosinor analysis confirmed this phase-related changes, showing a wider distribution of times of peak (acrophases). We conclude that daily disruptions in renal transplant recipients can be explained not necessarily by an absence in diurnal variation, but also by changes in waveform-related parameters of the rhythm, and that alterations in the phase of the rhythm are the most consistent finding in these patients...|$|R

The article is devoted to the analysis of the features of an individual?s professional development {{in the process of}} professional training in higher educational establishments. As the main prerequisites for professional development we choose the following provisions: 1) all people differ according to psychological characteristics and qualities; 2) the success of professionalism is determined by the degree of conformity of individual and psychological characteristics of an individual to the requirements of the profession; 3) every person meets a number of profession?s requirements; 4) the measure of the correlation of individual characteristics and professional requirements determines the level of interest to the profession, satisfaction in the profession, commitment to professional development; 5) professionalization is implemented throughout the professional path of individual?s development; 6) professional development of an individual, its operational and psychological qualities and structures is uneven and different; 7) the character of leading activity and its change are determining in the professional development of an individual; 8) attitude to the profession, its development and employment are determined and corrected by professional, psychological, physiological and other factors that define the characteristics of life and labor activity of a man. Professional development of an individual (professional genesis) can be viewed as the integration of two processes: individual?s development in ontogenesis (through the whole life) and its professionalization (since the period of professional self-identification up to the end of active employment). Professional formation is rather a complex process, which is the cyclical in nature, the authors outline its progressive (rising) and regressive (<b>descending)</b> <b>stages.</b> Progressive stage of individual?s professional formation is associated primarily with the formation of motives of professional activity and the structure of professional abilities, knowledge and skills. Regressive stage of professional development is characterized by the display of negative impact of the profession on a person; there is a possibility of a variety of professional deformations or negative states. The driving force of individual?s professional development is crisis, the outputs of which allow you to match the opportunities, needs and requirements of a subject and the requirements of specific conditions of professional activity. ???????????????? ??????????? ????????????????? ??????????? ????????
