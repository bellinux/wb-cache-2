5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Data</b> Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Nolan Bushnell saw Spacewar {{running on a}} {{mainframe}} at the University of Utah {{where he was a}} student. Bushnell worked during the summer at Lagoon Amusement Park in Utah as a manager of the games department overseeing the arcade games, and when he saw Spacewar he believed that an arcade game version of the game would be very popular. The high price of computers capable of running the game, however, meant that any such arcade game would not be economically feasible. After graduating from college Bushnell worked as an engineer in California for Ampex, an electronics company that worked in audio and video recording technology. He also met researcher Jim Stein, who worked for Stanford University's Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project; he learned from him that Spacewar was running on the laboratory's PDP-6, and played the game against him there when visiting. Soon after, he saw an ad <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Data</b> General Nova computer, which cost only US$4,000, and thought again about his Spacewar arcade game idea; he believed that at that price, if he were able to connect four monitors and coin slots to allow multiple games to run simultaneously, the game would be economically viable. He showed his office mate and fellow Ampex engineer Ted Dabney Spacewar at the Stanford laboratory, and the two agreed to work together to try and design a prototype of the game; Bushnell was more experienced with computers and digital engineering, while Dabney was more experienced with analog and hardware engineering, as he had been working on designing video processing and control circuits and power supplies.|$|E

A study in 2007 demonstrates a technique that can use scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to identify key morphological features of eggs and maggots. Some of the morphological differences that can help identify the different species are the presence/absence of anastomosis, the presence/absence of holes, and the shape and length of the median area.|$|E

The second use <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> from his anthropometric laboratory is for statistical studies.

40|$|Objective To {{demonstrate}} the incremental benefit of using free text data {{in addition to}} vital sign and demographic data to identify patients with suspected infection in the emergency department. Methods This was a retrospective, observational cohort study performed at a tertiary academic teaching hospital. All consecutive ED patient visits between 12 / 17 / 08 and 2 / 17 / 13 were included. No patients were excluded. The primary outcome measure was infection diagnosed in the emergency department defined as a patient having an infection related ED ICD- 9 -CM discharge diagnosis. Patients were randomly allocated to train (64 %), validate (20 %), and test (16 %) data sets. After preprocessing the free text using bigram and negation detection, we built four models to predict infection, incrementally adding vital signs, chief complaint, and free text nursing assessment. We used two different methods to represent free text: a bag of words model and a topic model. We then used a support vector machine to build the prediction model. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to compare the discriminatory power of each model. Results A total of 230, 936 patient visits {{were included in the}} study. Approximately 14 % of patients had the primary outcome of diagnosed infection. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> vitals model, which used only vital signs and demographic data, was 0. 67 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training <b>data</b> set, 0. 67 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> validation <b>data</b> set, and 0. 67 (95 % CI 0. 65 – 0. 69) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test <b>data</b> set. <b>The</b> AUC <b>for</b> <b>the</b> chief complaint model which also included demographic and vital sign data was 0. 84 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training <b>data</b> set, 0. 83 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> validation <b>data</b> set, and 0. 83 (95 % CI 0. 81 – 0. 84) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test <b>data</b> set. <b>The</b> best performing methods made use of all of the free text. In particular, <b>the</b> AUC <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bag-of-words model was 0. 89 for training data set, 0. 86 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> validation <b>data</b> set, and 0. 86 (95 % CI 0. 85 – 0. 87) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test <b>data</b> set. <b>The</b> AUC <b>for</b> <b>the</b> topic model was 0. 86 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training <b>data</b> set, 0. 86 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> validation <b>data</b> set, and 0. 85 (95 % CI 0. 84 – 0. 86) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test <b>data</b> set.

25|$|The {{client-side}} (Web browser) technologies used in Web 2.0 development include Ajax and JavaScript frameworks. Ajax programming uses JavaScript and the Document Object Model {{to update}} selected {{regions of the}} page area without undergoing a full page reload. To allow users to continue {{to interact with the}} page, communications such as data requests going to the server are separated from data coming back to the page (asynchronously). Otherwise, the user would have to routinely wait <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> to come back before they can do anything else on that page, just as a user has to wait for a page to complete the reload. This also increases overall performance of the site, as the sending of requests can complete quicker independent of blocking and queueing required to send data back to the client. The data fetched by an Ajax request is typically formatted in XML or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, two widely used structured data formats. Since both of these formats are natively understood by JavaScript, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data in their Web application. When this data is received via Ajax, the JavaScript program then uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the Web page based on the new data, allowing for a rapid and interactive user experience. In short, using these techniques, Web designers can make their pages function like desktop applications. For example, Google Docs uses this technique to create a Web-based word processor.|$|E
