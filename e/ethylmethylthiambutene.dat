50|$|Notable {{compounds}} include dimethylthiambutene, diethylthiambutene, <b>ethylmethylthiambutene,</b> pyrrolidinylthiambutene and piperidylthiambutene. Of these, <b>ethylmethylthiambutene</b> is {{the most}} potent, with 1.3x the potency of morphine, pyrrolidinylthiambutene is the least potent at 0.7x, and the rest are all around the same potency as morphine. Diethylthiambutene {{has been the most}} widely used, mainly in veterinary medicine.|$|E
50|$|Three {{of these}} {{compounds}} are explicitly listed as illegal drugs under UN convention, diethylthiambutene, dimethylthiambutene and <b>ethylmethylthiambutene,</b> {{and so are}} illegal throughout the world, but the rest will only be illegal {{in countries such as}} the USA, Australia and New Zealand that have laws equivalent to the Federal Analog Act.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethylmethylthiambutene</b> (N-ethyl-N-methyl-1-methyl-3,3-di-2-thienylallylamine; Emethibutin) is an opioid {{analgesic}} drug from the thiambutene family, around 1.3x {{the potency of}} morphine. It is under international control under Schedule I of the UN Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs 1961, presumably due to high abuse potential. It is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States with a DEA ACSCN of 9623 and zero annual manufacturing quota as of 2013.|$|E
50|$|Dimethylthiambutene (N,N-Dimethyl-1-methyl-3,3-di-2-thienylallylamine, DMTB, {{trade names}} Ohton, Aminobutene, Dimethibutin, Kobaton, Takaton, Dimethibutin) is an opioid {{analgesic}} drug, {{most often used}} in veterinary medicine in Japan {{and to a lesser}} extent in other countries in the region and around the world. It is the most prominent and widely used of the thiambutenes, a series of open-chain opioids structurally related to methadone which are also called the thienyl derivative opioids which also includes diethylthiambutene and <b>ethylmethylthiambutene,</b> as well as the non-opioid cough suppressant tipepidine.|$|E
50|$|Diethylthiambutene (Thiambutene, Themalon, Diethibutin, N,N-Diethyl-1-methyl-3,3-di-2-thienylallylamine) is an opioid {{analgesic}} drug {{developed in the}} 1950s which was mainly used as an anesthetic in veterinary medicine and continues, {{along with the other}} two thiambutenes dimethylthiambutene and <b>ethylmethylthiambutene</b> to be used for this purpose, particularly in Japan. It is now under international control under Schedule I of the UN Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs 1961, presumably due to high abuse potential, although little more information is available. It is listed under Schedule I of the US Controlled Substances Act as a Narcotic and has an ACSCN of 9616 with zero annual manufacturing quota as of 2013.|$|E
