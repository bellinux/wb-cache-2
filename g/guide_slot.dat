50|$|The {{fixed jaw}} can {{withstand}} bending stress {{far better than}} can the movable jaw, because the latter is supported only by the flat surfaces {{on either side of}} the <b>guide</b> <b>slot,</b> not the full thickness of the tool. The tool is therefore usually angled so that the movable jaw's area of contact is closer to the body of the tool, which means less bending stress.|$|E
50|$|During {{the third}} day solo in lunar orbit, Worden began to have some {{problems}} with the Mass Spectrometer. This was located {{on the end of}} a boom that is deployed and retracted periodically throughout the mission. Frequently instruments in the CM were indicating that it had failed to retract. To get it to retract properly he had to cycle the retract/deploy switch several times. During the EVA on the return to Earth, he inspected the housing and found that guide pins were barely coming through the <b>guide</b> <b>slot.</b> Further it was found that the problems with retraction always occurred after the housing had been in the shadow of the spacecraft, but would retract fully after being in sunlight. This was caused by the motor stalling out, implying that the parts of the boom were being deformed by thermal expansion. To stop this occurring, several modifications were made to the instruments used on Apollo 16 and Apollo 17.|$|E
50|$|By {{adding a}} set of {{eccentrics}} and <b>guide</b> <b>slots</b> to the axle of the supercharger, the Powerplus actively controls the position of these vanes, such that they maintain a constant small clearance from {{the walls of the}} housing. This is enough spacing to avoid friction, but close enough to keep pumping efficient.|$|R
50|$|When {{carpenters}} used to {{make their}} own mitre boxes, it was common to use a mitre box until its <b>guide</b> <b>slots</b> became worn and then make a new one out of scrap timber. There is still a case to be made for making one today; for example, if an odd size (say, 175mm) cornice is to be fixed, then a custom mitre box with a bottom board that is 175mm wide would ensure that the cornice sits true while the cuts are being made to it. The three pieces of timber that form the mitre box are nailed together, and the top steadying pieces are fixed with smaller panel pins. The angles are marked (at any angle, not necessarily 45 degrees) and the <b>guide</b> <b>slots</b> are cut with the same saw that will be used {{for the rest of the}} cutting.|$|R

50|$|Minic Motorways was {{a system}} of HO-scale road {{vehicles}} that followed a slot in a plastic roadway. The system aimed {{as far as possible}} for realism, and therefore the slot was as narrow as possible (about 1/8 in) with brass conductors placed vertically at each side. The vehicles picked up power via a small wheel (called a Gimbal Wheel) on their underside, which was divided into two halves by an insulating flange. At some time in the 1960s this mechanism was replaced by a pair of vertically sprung sliding pickups. These differed from that of electric racing car systems such as the same company's Scalextric, in which the electrical conductors were spaced more widely apart {{on each side of the}} <b>guide</b> <b>slot,</b> and were hence more stable.There was a small removable peg at the back of the vehicles to stabilize it when in reverse.Vehicles were controlled by a hand-held controller, which had a thumb-operated speed control plus a rotating reversing switch.|$|E
50|$|The Karabiner Model 1931 feeds from a {{detachable}} box magazine machined {{to match}} the cartridge for which the rifle was being chambered, that can hold up to 6 rifle cartridges. The magazine release button {{is an integral part}} of the magazine.For reloading the K31 box magazine was normally not exchanged for another magazine but a unique formed phenolic resin embedded paper stripper clip with a tinned metal edge holding six rounds was used. Whereas most chargers or stripper clips only held the rounds at the end of the cartridge cases, the K31 charger nearly covers the entire cartridge. The charger has a <b>guide</b> <b>slot</b> wide enough for a gloved thumb to force rounds down and into the magazine in one smooth motion. The chargers or stripper clips have to be manually removed before the bolt can be closed.When the last cartridge from the magazine is fired, the follower comes up automatically during cycling locking the bolt open and preventing it from closing reminding the user the K31 needs to be reloaded.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Portland TV {{launched}} {{a series of}} UK-based pornographic TV channels called Red Hot. The various channels subsequently changed their names, closed and relaunched several times. During the 2000s Portland TV launched sister channels to Television X on the Sky UK satellite platform, known simply as Television X 2, Television X 3 and later on Television X 4. In 2009, Television X received a new logo and its sister channels changed their names to more descriptive ones. Television X 2 was renamed Television X Amateur (gaining a orange logo), Television X 3 was renamed Television X Brits (gaining a Union-Jack themed logo) and Television X 4 was renamed Television X FFWD (gaining a purple logo). TVX FFWD was closed in 2009 and replaced with Red Hot Mums, the Electronic program <b>guide</b> <b>slot</b> for TVX Amateur was sold to Red Hot in 2012, and TVX Brits was renamed TVXXX in 2016. Northern and Shell sold Portland TV in 2016. By 2017 only the original Television X and Television XXX channels remained.

50|$|The AKM’s barrel is {{installed}} in the forward trunnion and pinned (as opposed to the AK-47, which has a one piece receiver with integral trunnions and a barrel that is screwed-in). Additionally the barrel has horizontal <b>guide</b> <b>slots</b> that help align and secure the handguards in place. To increase the weapon’s accuracy during automatic fire, the AKM was fitted with a slant cut muzzle brake that helps redirect expanding propellant gases upward {{and to the right}} during firing, which mitigates the rise of the muzzle during an automatic burst when held by a right-handed firer. The muzzle brake is threaded on {{to the end of the}} barrel with a left-hand thread. Not all AKMs had slant muzzle brakes; some were also fitted with the older muzzle nut which came from the AK-47. Most AKMs with muzzle nuts were older production weapons. The AKM's slant brake can also be used on the AK-47, which had a simple nut to cover the threads.|$|R
5000|$|The SG 540 is an air-cooled, gas-operated, {{selective}} fire {{assault rifle}} that fires from a closed bolt position. SIG designers used a long-stroke piston-driven action (with the recoil spring {{wrapped around the}} piston rod itself) and an adjustable gas regulator with three settings: [...] "0"—used to launch rifle grenades, [...] "1"—used in normal operating conditions and [...] "2"—used in extreme environmental conditions or {{in the presence of}} heavy fouling. The firearm is locked into battery by means of a rotating bolt which features two heavy steel locking lugs. The bolt head is rotated by a control cam riding in a helical <b>guide</b> <b>slot</b> machined into the bolt carrier. When a shot is fired, propellant gases from the barrel are fed into the gas cylinder located above the barrel and impart rearward pressure on the piston rod, which drives the bolt carrier back. After a certain amount of free travel built into the system to allow the projectile to depart the barrel, residual gas pressures in the bore drop to a safe level, allowing the breech to be opened. The cam slot in the bolt carrier proceeds to actuate the camming stud in the bolt, rotating the bolt head out of engagement with the locking abutments in the receiver. The spent cartridge casing is extracted by a claw extractor contained in the bolt assembly while a protrusion on one of the internal bolt carrier guide rails in the upper receiver acts as the fixed ejector, removing the casing through a port {{on the right side of}} the receiver housing.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Underactuated finger {{mechanism}} is beneficial in the anthropomorphic applications {{in which it}} reduces the finger size, weight and power consumption due to the less number of actuators compared to its number of Degree Of Freedom (DOF). However, the currently existing underactuated finger is limited to grasping operations only and unable to pinch with the finger tip. Moreover, the behavior of such finger in achieving the desired configuration depends greatly on its geometric parameters. Therefore, this study presented a new bar linkage type underactuated finger mechanism with an optimized parameter set that resembled the human finger in performing both pinching and grasping operation. Approach: The existing seven bar linkage underactuated finger mechanism was modified by adding a <b>guiding</b> <b>slot</b> in the upper middle phalange link so that its length can be adjusted to achieve human fingers configuration during pinching and grasping. A multiobjective optimization problem subjected to parameter constraints was then formulated using the evaluation criteria for human finger kinematics during pinching and grasping. Results: The numerical result obtained gave an improved set of geometrical parameter to achieve these configurations as it provided less error than the initial guess. Conclusion: A new underactuated finger mechanism that resembled the human finger to perform both pinching and grasping operation was presented in this study. The hardware fabrication {{will be carried out}} in the future using the optimized lengths obtained...|$|R

40|$|Abstract* — Quality-of-Service (QoS) {{communication}} {{has been}} a key issue since the birth of Network-on-Chip (NoC). Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) techniques are well-recognized {{to be capable of}} providing guarantees in latency and bandwidth. However, current TDM VC proposals assume synchronous operation and use a costly slot allocation table to statically allocate bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a novel TDM VC implementation that releases the strict synchronous operation assumption and computes slot allocation fully dynamically. To promise VC contention-free, we use the Logical Network theory to <b>guide</b> the <b>slot</b> computation. The slot allocation information is computed once and propagated downstream. This enables adaptive VC configuration and also allows us to use smaller allocation tables in routers. We describe our dynamic TDM VC implementation mechanism, and detail the router design to support this mechanism. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Owing to its {{superior}} properties, such as fast iden-tification {{and relatively}} long interrogating range over barcode systems, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has promising application prospects in inventory management. This paper studies {{the problem of}} complete identification of missing RFID tag, which is important in practice. Time efficiency is the key performance metric of missing tag identification. However, the existing protocols are ineffective in terms of execution time and can hardly satisfy the requirements of real-time applications. In this paper, a Multi-hashing based Missing Tag Identification (MMTI) protocol is proposed, which achieves better time efficiency by improving the utilization of the time frame used for identification. Specifically, the reader recursively sends bitmaps that reflect the current slot occupation state to <b>guide</b> the <b>slot</b> selection of the next hashing process, thereby changing more empty or collision slots to the expected singleton slots. We investigate the optimal parameter settings to maximize {{the performance of the}} MMTI protocol. Furthermore, we discuss the case of channel error and propose the countermeasures to make the MMTI workable in the scenarios with imperfect communication channels.

40|$|Background: A {{reduction}} in orthodontic treatment {{time can be}} attained using corticotomies. The aggressive nature of corticotomy due to the elevation of muco-periosteal flaps and to {{the duration of the}} surgery raised reluctance for its employ among patients and dental community. This study aims to provide detailed information on the design and manufacture of a 3 D-printed CAD-CAM (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing) surgical guide which can aid the clinician in achieving a minimally-invasive, flapless corticotomy. Material and Methods: An impression of dental arches was created; the models were digitally-acquired using a 3 D scanner and saved as STereoLithography (STL) files. The patient underwent cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) : images of jaws and teeth were transformed into 3 D models and saved as an STL file. An acrylic template with the design of a surgical guide was manufactured and scanned. The STLs of jaws, scanned casts, and acrylic templates were matched. 3 D modeling software allowed the view of the 3 D models from different perspectives and planes with perfect rendering. The 3 D model of the acrylic template was transformed into a surgical <b>guide</b> with <b>slots</b> designed to <b>guide,</b> at first, a scalpel blade and then a piezoelectric cutting insert. The 3 D STL model of the surgical guide was printed. Results: This procedure allowed the manufacturing of a 3 D-printed CAD/CAM surgical guide, which overcomes the disadvantages of the corticotomy, removing the need for flap elevation. No discomfort, early surgical complications or unexpected events were observed. Conclusions: The effectiveness of this minimally-invasive surgical technique can offer the clinician a valid alternative to other methods currently in us...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} simple but {{efficient}} timing-driven placement algorithm for FPGAs. The algorithm computes forces acting on a logic block in the FPGA to determine its relative location with respect to other blocks. The forces depend on the criticality of nets shared between the two blocks. Unlike other net-based approaches, timing constraints are incorporated directly into the force equations to <b>guide</b> the placement. <b>Slot</b> assignment is then used to move the blocks into valid slot locations on the FPGA chip. The assignment algorithm also makes use of the delay information of nets so that the final placement is {{able to meet the}} timing criteria specified for the circuit. The novelty of the approach lies in the formulation of the force equations {{and the manner in which}} weights of the nets are dynamically altered to influence the placement.
