5000|$|<b>Fluroxypyr,</b> a systemic, {{selective}} herbicide, is {{used for}} the control of broad-leaved weeds in small grain cereals, maize, pastures, rangeland and turf. It is a synthetic auxin. In cereal growing, fluroxypyr's key importance is control of cleavers, Galium aparine. Other key broadleaf weeds are also controlled.|$|E
50|$|Aside from {{mechanical}} removal or borax treatment, {{the other}} alternative for Glechoma infestation is use of commercial herbicides. There is some disagreement over {{the effectiveness of}} various herbicides, with dicamba (Trimec and Weed-B-Gon) and 2,4-D being described variously as both effective and ineffective by different sources. Some {{or all of the}} disagreement {{may be due to the}} existence of subpopulations which have differing susceptibilities to different compounds, as well as to differing rates of application. To avoid generating herbicide resistance, the same product should not be used several years in succession; rather, various products should be used in rotation.Triclopyr has also been described as effective, and Clopyralid, MCPP, and quinclorac as ineffective. <b>Fluroxypyr</b> and Confront have also been described as effective, but sales of both are restricted to professionals. Two applications ten to fourteen days apart are necessary; also, the ability of the surviving plants to regenerate after 24 days can require a second treatment four or five weeks later, and even more followups.|$|E

30|$|Because <b>fluroxypyr</b> has {{no current}} {{recommendation}} {{for use with}} radiata pine or for control of broom (Young 2015), application rates used in this trial were based on other uses of this herbicide. The broom efficacy work showed that the medium rate selected was too low to give good control of broom (median injury ratings of only 6 or less), whereas the high rate (1.0  kg ae ha− 1) gave very good control of broom (median injury ratings of 10 for plants 3, 6 or 9  months old), similar to that obtained by the clopyralid/triclopyr mixtures. However, the phytotoxicity caused to radiata pine by the two higher rates of <b>fluroxypyr</b> showed it was not suitable for selective use in pines at these rates. This result was not surprising given the very similar nature of <b>fluroxypyr</b> to triclopyr, as triclopyr at 0.6  kg ae ha− 1 was shown by Rolando et al. (2011 b) to cause damage to 16 -month-old radiata pine plants. In contrast, triclopyr applied at 0.6  kg ae ha− 1 in the high clopyralid/triclopyr treatment {{in the current study}} did not cause the same decrease in tree growth as recorded by Rolando et al. (2011 b). <b>Fluroxypyr</b> did not appear suitable for controlling broom selectively in radiata pine based on this experiment. However, {{it would be interesting to}} compare a clopyralid/fluroxypyr mix with a clopyralid/triclopyr mix at comparable rates to determine whether any advantage (e.g. lower cost, better efficacy) would be provided by using <b>fluroxypyr</b> rather than triclopyr in combination with clopyralid.|$|E
30|$|Another {{pyridine}} herbicide {{available in}} New Zealand, and very similar in structure to triclopyr, is <b>fluroxypyr.</b> Although {{it is not}} registered in New Zealand for control of broom or use in pines (Young 2015), Cole and Newton (1988) found it less phytotoxic to ponderosa pine than triclopyr, while providing effective control of some weedy shrub species.

R. M. King & H. Rob. (Siam weed) seeds at three different stages of maturity. After foliar application of <b>fluroxypyr</b> germination of mature seeds was reduced by 88 % and intermediate and immature seeds were reduced by 100 %, compared to the control. <b>Fluroxypyr</b> also reduced the viability of mature, intermediate and immature seeds by 79, 89 and 67 % respectively, compared to the control. Metsulfuron-methyl reduced germination of intermediate and immature seeds by 53 and 99 % respectively compared to the control. Viability was also reduced by 74 and 96 % respectively, compared to the control. Mature seeds were not affected by metsulfuron-methyl as germination and viability increased by 2 % and 1 % respectively, as compared to the control. These results show that these herbicides are capable of reducing the amount of viable seed entering the seed bank. However depending on the treatment and stage of seed development a percentage of seeds on the plants will remain viable and contribute to the seed bank. This information is of value to Siam weed eradication teams as plants are most easily located and subsequently treated at the time of flowering. Knowledge of the impact of control methods on seeds at various stages of development will help determine the most suitable chemical control option for a given situation...|$|E
40|$|These {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on several central Texas agricultural producers?? properties, the Stiles Farm Foundation, the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, and the Texas A&M University campus. First, an experimental herbicide from Dow AgroSciences, GF- 884, was evaluated for effectiveness in controlling three annual and three perennial weed species in production pasture lands and hay meadows. Several rates of GF- 884 were examined and evaluated against three registered pasture products and one non-selective herbicide. Next, GF- 884 was assessed for tolerance on two common bermudagrass hybrids (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.) at three progressive rates with and without adjuvant. Finally, the herbicides, picloram and <b>fluroxypyr,</b> were applied to common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) to characterize their individual absorption and translocation and assess any influence one might have on the other. GF- 884 applied at rates of 0. 91 and 1. 14 kg a. e. /ha provided > 85 % and > 75 % control of the annual and perennial weed species evaluated, respectively. These same rates of GF- 884 consistently provided control that was equivalent or better than thatachieved with the registered products. No differences were observed among treatments when shoots from the perennial species were evaluated 12 months following treatment application. The tolerance experiments utilized GF- 884 at rates twice that used to evaluate weed control efficacy. These elevated rates {{did not result in}} discernable influences on yield or forage quality for either hybrid forage grass when compared to untreated areas. The efficacy and tolerance observations suggest that GF- 884 applied at the highest recommended weed control rate can effectively control several annual and perennial weed species without imparting detrimental effects to the hybrid bermudagrass being produced. Finally, in the presence of <b>fluroxypyr,</b> 14 C picloram absorption was maintained throughout all sampling intervals. Picloram applied alone, maximized 14 C absorption at 6 HAT then declined significantly. At the final sampling, 14 C from picloram applied alone was in greater concentration in the treated leaf and the root. Picloram significantly decreased absorption of 14 C <b>fluroxypyr.</b> <b>Fluroxypyr</b> alone maintained 14 C absorption throughout all samplings, whereas the combination maximized at 12 HAT.

Each treatment was replicated three times in a randomized complete block design with individual plot sizes of 3 x 3 m. Herbicides were applied with hand sprayers in 1017 L/ha solution. Visual evaluations of defoliation were made about 1 and 12 months after treatment (MAT) and mortality was estimated about 1 year after treatment (YAT). Defoliation 1 MAT varied among herbicides with significant location by year and herbicide by year interactions. Treatments providing greater than 70 % defoliation 12 MAT both years were triclopyr + 2, 4 -D (1. 12 + 1. 06 kg ae/ha), triclopyr + <b>fluroxypyr</b> (1. 83 + 0. 61 kg ae/ha), picloram + <b>fluroxypyr</b> (0. 41 + 0. 41 and 0. 82 + 0. 82 kg ae/ha), and picloram + 2, 4 -D + triclopyr (0. 66 + 2. 44 + 2. 44 kg ae/ha). Rough-leaved dogwood is difficult to control with a single herbicid...|$|E
40|$|Arylex™ active {{is a new}} auxinic {{herbicide}} for postemergence {{control of}} a range of important broadleaf weeds in cereals. It has been discovered and developed by Dow AgroSciences globally as a first member of the new ‘arylpicolinate‘ structural class. Arylex applied together with safener brings excellent crop safety and due to the rapid degradation in soil and plant tissue it does not limit the following crop choice. In Europe the first two herbicides containing this active are Zypar™ and Pixxaro™ EC. Zypar is a premix of Arylex and florasulam, delivering at the 1 L/ha maximum use rate 6 g ae/ha of Arylex and 5 g/ha of florasulam. It can be applied to all cereals, apart from oats, in autumn and spring. Spring application is allowed from BBCH 13 till BBCH 45, however the best performance is reached up to BBCH 32. Zypar’s spectrum of controlled weeds is very wide. Pixxaro EC is a combination of Arylex and <b>fluroxypyr</b> and at 0. 5 l/ha dose rate delivers 6 g ae/ha of Arylex and 140 g ae/ha of <b>fluroxypyr.</b> It can be applied in all cereals, apart from oats, in spring from BBCH 13 till BBCH 45, while the best performance is observed between BBCH 30 and 45. Pixxaro EC shows excellent efficacy against key weeds, especially Galium aparine and at all growth stages. This herbicide brings a novel non-ALS solution and will be a key component of anti-resistance strategies for broadleaf weeds in cereals...|$|E
30|$|The {{high rate}} of each {{treatment}} killed all the 3 -, 6 -, and 9 -month-old broom plants, but only the {{high rate of}} hexazinone or the clopyralid/triclopyr mixture killed the 12 -month-old broom plants. In addition, the medium rate of clopyralid/triclopyr, terbuthylazine or clopyralid/triclopyr/picloram/aminopyralid killed all 3 -, 6 -, and 9 -month-old broom plants. The remaining treatments were not completely effective (i.e. median injury rating was less than 10). All of the registered herbicides caused minimal damage to radiata pine, but the damage caused by <b>fluroxypyr</b> to radiata pine was considered too great to recommend operational use of this chemical on its own.|$|E
40|$|Large {{amounts of}} urea and various {{herbicides}} {{are applied to}} Chilean Andisols by farmers; however, how different herbicide types affect bacterial communities in urea-fertilized soils remains unknown. In this study, the effect of post-emergent herbicides (MCPA, flumetsulam, <b>fluroxypyr,</b> triclopyr, clopyralid and picloram) on total bacterial (TB) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities was investigated in a urea-fertilized soil microcosm using {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} at days 1 and 15 of incubation. The residual concentrations of herbicides in microcosm soils were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Differences in bacterial communities were analyzed and visualized with non-metric multidimensional scaling. All of the tested herbicides decreased in microcosm soils, reaching 46 – 98 % of dissipation at 15 days. Changes in the TB and AOB communities were variable, depending on the urea and herbicide dosage, herbicide type and sampling time. Under the recommended dose of urea (570 mg kg? 1 soil), soils that were treated with MCPA and triclopyr showed significant changes in TB and AOB community structures compared to control soils at both sampling times. When a 2 -fold-higher recommended dose of urea (1140 mg kg? 1 soil) was applied, the TB communities were mainly affected by flumetsulam and picloram at both sampling times. Changes in the AOB communities were mainly observed in soils that were treated with MCPA and <b>fluroxypyr</b> under both urea doses. This study determined which herbicides (and doses) significantly affect the bacterial communities in urea-fertilized soils. This evidence can be very useful when management practices are being designed, revised and/or established in Andisols...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of volunteer potato Solanum tuberosum L., cutleaf nightshade, S. triflorum N., and hairy nightshade, S. physalifolium Rusby (Solanales: Solanaceae), throughout potato crop rotations can diminish {{the effectiveness of}} crop rotations designed to control disease and pest problems associated with growing potatoes. In greenhouse bioassays, larvae of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) were placed in population densities of 0, 5, 10, and 40 per potato (cv. Russet Burbank) plant and 0, 5, 10, and 15 per cutleaf nightshade and hairy nightshade plant. Plants were treated with different rates of herbicides including <b>fluroxypyr,</b> prometryn, and mesotrione rates, and the physiological response on the potato plants was assessed by weighing shoot biomass 14 days after treatment. Consistently, across all bioassays, rate response functions were shifted as L. decemlineata density increased, such that less herbicide was required to achieve control. For instance, the herbicide rate needed to achieve 90 % reduction in potato biomass was reduced from 62 to 0 g <b>fluroxypyr</b> per hectare and 711 to 0 g prometryn per hectare as L. decemlineata density was increased to 40 larvae per plant. Herbivory at higher L. decemlineata population densities and herbicides above certain rates resulted in large reductions in cutleaf and hairy nightshade biomass. Differences in rate response functions among L. decemlineata population densities indicated that L. decemlineata contributed to weed suppression in combination with herbicides. These data suggest that integrated weed management systems targeting volunteer potato, cutleaf nightshade, and hairy nightshade can be more effective when herbicide applications are combined with herbivory by naturally occurring Colorado potato beetles...|$|E
40|$|Siam Weed (Chromoleana odorata) is {{the target}} of an {{eradication}} program in north Queensland; however some infestations occur on ground inaccessible to high volume, ground based herbicide spray equipment. Four foliar herbicides were applied to dense infestations of mature Siam Weed in March 2009, near Townsville, north Queensland. Low volume, high concentration solutions containing 40 g L- 1 a. i. glyphosate, 1. 2 g L- 1 a. i metsulfuron-methyl, 10 g L- 1 a. i. <b>fluroxypyr</b> + 0. 7 g L- 1 a. i. aminopyralid and 15 g L- 1 a. i. triclopyr + 5 g L- 1 a. i. picloram + 0. 4 g L- 1 a. i. aminopyralid were applied using a 5 L backpack and hand gun (or splatter gun). Relatively small amounts (approximately 24 - 28 mL) of the high concentration solutions were applied to each bush and assessments of the replicated treated and untreated control plots were conducted 76, 207 and 356 days after treatment. These assessments demonstrated that the <b>fluroxypyr</b> and triclopyr based herbicides controlled 96 to 100 % of plants. The metsulfuron-methyl and glyphosate based herbicides controlled 40 and 57 % of plants respectively 12 months after treatment, when 3 % of untreated control plants were dead. The trial demonstrated that this application method and either of two herbicides provides an additional tool for controlling Siam weed in remote areas, which are inaccessible to traditional higher volume foliar herbicide applications. Lower volume herbicide solutions reduce the volume of water and thus the effort needed to effectively treat less accessible infestations...|$|E
