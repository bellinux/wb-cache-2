25|$|At Kytmanovo in Russia between Mongolia and Kazakhstan, dated 1746–1626 BC, {{a strain}} of Yersinia pestis was {{extracted}} from a dead woman's tooth in a grave common to her and to two children. This strain's genes express <b>flagellin,</b> which triggers the human immune response. However, by contrast with other prehistoric Yersinia pestis bacteria, the strain does so weakly; later, historic plague does not express <b>flagellin</b> at all, accounting for its virulence. The Kytmanovo strain was therefore under selection toward becoming a plague (although {{it was not the}} plague). The three people in that grave all died at the same time, and the researcher believes that this para-plague is what killed them.|$|E

25|$|Plants are {{affected}} by multiple pathogens throughout their lifetime. In response {{to the presence of}} pathogens, plants have evolved receptors on the cell surface to detect and respond to pathogens. Arabidopsis Thaliana is a model organism used to determine specific defense mechanisms of plant-pathogen resistance. These plants have special receptors on their cell surfaces that allow for detection of pathogens and initiate mechanisms to inhibit pathogen growth. They contain two receptors, FLS2 (bacterial <b>flagellin</b> receptor) and EF-Tu (bacterial EF-Tu protein), which use signal transduction pathways to initiate the disease response pathway. The pathway leads to the recognition of the pathogen causing the infected cells to undergo cell death {{to stop the spread of}} the pathogen. Plants with FLS2 and EF-Tu receptors have shown to have increased fitness in the population. This has led to the belief that plant-pathogen resistance is an evolutionary mechanism that has built up over generations to respond to dynamic environments, such as increased predation and extreme temperatures.|$|E

We demonstrate that, in H. pylori, glycosylation extends to proteins other than <b>flagellins</b> and to sugars other than pseudaminic acid. Several candidate glycoproteins distinct from the <b>flagellins</b> were detected via ProQ-emerald staining and DIG- or biotin- hydrazide labeling of the soluble and outer membrane fractions of wild-type H. pylori, suggesting that protein glycosylation {{is not limited to}} the <b>flagellins.</b> DIG-hydrazide labeling of proteins from pseudaminic acid biosynthesis pathway mutants showed that the glycosylation of some glycoproteins is not dependent on the pseudaminic acid glycosylation pathway, indicating the existence of a novel glycosylation pathway. Fractions enriched in glycoprotein candidates by ion exchange chromatography were used to extract the sugars by acid hydrolysis. High performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection revealed characteristic monosaccharide peaks in these extracts. The monosaccharides were then identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS.

40|$|Although chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{infection}} {{is the major}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, there is no approved vaccine for human use against P. aeruginosa.

Intramuscular immunization with <b>flagellins</b> and OprI (separate) or OprI-flagellin fusion proteins generated significant antiflagellin immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses. However, only the fusions of OprI with type A and type B <b>flagellins</b> generated OprI-specific IgG. Immunization with a combination of OprF epitope 8 (OprF 311 - 341), OprI, and <b>flagellins</b> elicited high-affinity IgG antibodies specific to <b>flagellins,</b> OprI, and OprF that individually promoted extensive deposition of C 3 on P. aeruginosa. Although these antibodies exhibited potent antibody-dependent complement-mediated killing of nonmucoid bacteria, they were significantly less effective with mucoid isolates. Mice immunized with the OprF 311 - 341 -OprI-flagellin fusion had a significantly lower bacterial burden three days postchallenge and cleared the infection significantly faster than control mice. In addition, mice immunized with the OprF 311 - 341 -OprI-flagellin fusion had significantly less inflammation and lung damage throughout the infection than OprF-OprI-immunized mice. Based on our results, OprF 311 - 341 -OprI-flagellin fusion proteins have substantial potential as components of a vaccine against nonmucoid P. aeruginosa, which appears to be the phenotype of the bacterium that initially colonizes CF patients...|$|R

40|$|The archaeal {{flagellum}} is {{a unique}} motility organelle. While superficially similar to the bacterial flagellum, several similarities have been reported between the archaeal flagellum and the bacterial type IV pilus system. These include the multiflagellin nature of the flagellar filament, N-terminal sequence similarities between archaeal <b>flagellins</b> and bacterial type IV pilins, {{as well as the}} presence of homologous proteins in the two systems. Recent advances in archaeal flagella research add to the growing list of similarities. First, the preflagellin peptidase that is responsible for processing the N-terminal signal peptide in preflagellins has been identified. The preflagellin peptidase is a membrane-bound enzyme topologically similar to its counterpart in the type IV pilus system (prepilin peptidase); the two enzymes are demonstrated to utilize the same catalytic mechanism. Second, {{it has been suggested that}} the archaeal flagellum and the bacterial type IV pilus share a similar mode of assembly. While bacterial <b>flagellins</b> and type IV pilins can be modified with O-linked glycans, N-linked glycans have recently been reported on archaeal <b>flagellins.</b> This mode of glycosylation, as well as the observation that the archaeal flagellum lacks a central channel, are both consistent with the proposed assembly model. On the other hand, the failure to identify other genes involved in archaeal flagellation by homology searches likely implies a novel aspect of the archaeal flagellar system.

40|$|Mutants were isolated, {{mostly from}} strains of Salmonella, which possessed {{aberrant}} motility due to defects {{in the construction}} of the flagellar filament. These mutants were characterised by electron microscopy and the helical shape of the filament shown to exhibit abnormalities of pitch or amplitude, or both pitch and amplitude. Normally motile and partially motile revertants of non-motile mutants ("straight" or "curly" filaments) were also isolated and characterised. Recovery of motility was either due to full reversion to the normal waveform, possession of extra long but curly filaments, or possession of short filaments presumably of the normal waveform. In the latter two cases swarming through soft agar was slow. The variation in filament surface structure amongst strains of Escherichia coli (morphotypes) reported by Lawn, Orskov and Orskov (1977) was confirmed but no similar variations were found amongst a wide range of bacterial genera investigated. Attempts to "convert" one surface type of Escherichia coli to another by selection in media containing appropriate antisera were unsuccessful though mutants with considerably less specificity for the original antiserum were obtained.
