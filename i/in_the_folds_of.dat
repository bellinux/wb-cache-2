5|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater {{is centered}} {{on the front steps}} of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library {{in the center of the}} campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.|$|E

Their favoured prey are the black house spider (Badumna insignis) and the closely related brown house spider (Badumna longinqua), both of which are, like the whitetail, native to Australia but have been {{inadvertently}} introduced to New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|The {{human brain}} {{is not fully}} {{developed}} {{by the time a}} person reaches puberty. Between the ages of 10 and 25, the brain undergoes changes that have important implications for behavior (see Cognitive development below). The brain reaches 90% of its adult size by the time a person is six years of age. Thus, the brain does not grow in size much during adolescence. However, the creases in the brain continue to become more complex until the late teens. The biggest changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> the brain during this time occur in the parts of the cortex that process cognitive and emotional information.|$|E
25|$|All five {{versions}} of the picture are of roughly the same large size (2.6 x 2.2 m). Bonaparte appears mounted in the uniform of a general in chief, wearing a gold-trimmed bicorne, and armed with a Mamluk-style sabre. He is wreathed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> a large cloak which billows in the wind. His head is turned towards the viewer, and he gestures {{with his right hand}} toward the mountain summit. His left hand grips the reins of his steed. The horse rears up on its back legs, its mane and tail whipped against its body by the same wind that inflates Napoleon's cloak. In background a line of the soldiers interspersed with artillery make their way up the mountain. Dark clouds hang over the picture and in front of Bonaparte the mountains rise up sharply. In the foreground BONAPARTE, HANNIBAL and KAROLVS MAGNVS IMP. are engraved on rocks. On the breastplate yoke of the horse, the picture is signed and dated.|$|E
25|$|Columbanus did {{not lead}} a perfect life. According to Jonas and other sources, he could be impetuous and even headstrong, for by nature he was eager, passionate, and dauntless. These qualities were both {{the source of his}} power and the cause of his mistakes. His virtues, however, were quite remarkable. Like many saints, he had a great love for God's creatures. Stories claim that as he walked in the woods, it was not {{uncommon}} for birds to land on his shoulders to be caressed, or for squirrels to run down from the trees and nestle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> his cowl. Although a strong defender of Irish traditions, he never wavered in showing deep respect for the Holy See as the supreme authority. His influence in Europe was due to the conversions he effected and to the rule that he composed. It may be that the example and success of Saint Columba in Caledonia inspired him to similar exertions. The life of Columbanus stands as the prototype of missionary activity in Europe, followed by such men as Saint Kilian, Vergilius of Salzburg, Donatus of Fiesole, Wilfrid, Willibrord, Suitbert of Kaiserwerdt, Saint Boniface, and Ursicinus of Saint-Ursanne.|$|E

500|$|Male Lepidoptera possess special scales, called androconia (singular – androconium), {{which have}} evolved {{as a result}} of sexual {{selection}} for the purposes of disseminating pheromones for attracting suitable mates. Androconia may be dispersed on the wings, body, or legs or occur in patches, referred to as [...] "brands", [...] "sex brands" [...] or [...] "stigmata" [...] on the wings, usually in invaginations of the upper surface of the forewings, sometimes concealed by other scales. Androconia are also known to occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> wings. These brands sometimes consist of hairlike tufts which facilitate the diffusion of the pheromone. The role of androconia in the courtship of pierid and nymphalid butterflies, such as Pyronia tithonus, has been proven experimentally.|$|E

500|$|After Ivan Vladislav's {{death in}} February 1018, Diogenes {{was charged with}} mopping up the last {{remaining}} centres of Bulgarian resistance. He took Sirmium and was named its commander (archon); his authority extended over the vassal Serbian statelets of Raška. His title was possibly that of [...] "strategos of Serbia" [...] (Greek: στρατηγός Σερβίας), which is attested in a seal attributed to him. Diogenes was ordered by Basil II to subdue Sermon, the ruler of Sirmium, to consolidate Byzantine control of the northern Balkans. Consequently, Diogenes invited Sermon to {{a meeting at the}} estuary of the river Sava in the Danube, where each would only be accompanied by three attendants. Diogenes had hidden his sword <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> his clothes, and struck Sermon down. He then marched his army into Sirmium, taking possession of the town. Sermon's wife was sent as a captive to Constantinople.|$|E

2500|$|Owners of male horses, both geldings and stallions, need to {{occasionally}} {{check the}} horse's [...] "sheath," [...] {{the pocket of}} skin that protects the penis of the horse {{when it is not}} in use for urination (or, in the case of stallions, breeding). Geldings tend to accumulate smegma and other debris at a higher rate than stallions, probably because geldings rarely fully extrude the penis, and thus dirt and smegma build up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> skin.|$|E

2500|$|The altarpiece {{is unusual}} {{because of the}} degree to which Memling copied and {{repeated}} the composition's elements in other paintings. The same four saints are found in works executed between 1468 and 1489. The most similar is Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York. Except for the setting, which is a garden instead of a columned space, it is almost identical. [...] Ainsworth writes aside from differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> the saints' dresses they are [...] "virtually identical to type, costume and gesture". [...] Art historians are uncertain when the New York panel was painted; 1480 seems a probably date according to tree ring analysis.|$|E
2500|$|The Aquila was {{the eagle}} {{standard}} of a Roman legion, carried {{by a special}} grade legionary known as an Aquilifer. One eagle standard was carried by each legion. Pliny the Elder (H.N. x.16) enumerates five animals displayed on [...] Roman military ensigns: the eagle, the wolf, the minotaur, the horse, and the boar. In the second consulship of Gaius Marius (104 BC) the four quadrupeds were laid aside as standards, the eagle being alone retained. It was made of silver, or bronze, with outstretched wings, but was probably of a relatively small size, since a standard-bearer (signifer) under Julius Caesar is said in circumstances of danger to have wrenched the eagle from its staff and concealed it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> his girdle.|$|E

These two buckshot and two others penetrated his head and flattened against the posterior wall of the skull, and others penetrated the face and chest. He also noted {{that one of the}} grains had passed through two heavy wool shirts and a blanket-lined canvas coat and vest before coming to rest deep in his chest. But Goodfellow was fascinated to find <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> a Chinese silk handkerchief around Grounds' neck two shotgun pellets but no holes.
