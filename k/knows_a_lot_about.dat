40|$|In The Soul of Anime, Ian Condry {{seeks to}} explore the {{emergence}} of anime as a global cultural phenomenon. Drawing on ethnographic research including interviews with artists at some of Tokyo’s leading animation studios – such as Madhouse, Gonzo, Aniplex, and Studio Ghibli – Condry discusses how anime’s fictional characters and worlds become platforms for collaborative creativity. Casey Brienza finds {{that this is an}} excellent work which successfully negotiates that difficult proposition of holding onto the interest of readers who <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> anime but not <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> anthropology as well as readers who <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> anthropology but hardly anything at all about anime.
