500|$|The British re-located Bismarck at 10:30 on 26 May, when a Catalina {{flying boat}} of RAF Coastal Command sighted her, {{heading for the}} French port of Brest. Rodney and King George V were still about [...] away. The {{aircraft}} carrier [...] was ordered to launch an air attack, and at 22:25 her torpedo bombers, a flight of Fairey Swordfishes damaged Bismarck, slowing her down and jamming her rudder, <b>forcing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> {{back out into the}} Atlantic, away from the safety of port. At 15:00 Rodney joined King George V and they maintained 22 knots – which was nearly maximum speed for Rodney. King George V had only 32 percent of her fuel left while Rodney had only enough fuel to continue the chase at high speed until 8:00 the following day.|$|E
500|$|The year 1902 {{began with}} the same routine of {{training}} operations as in previous years for the ships of the I Squadron. The last ironclad finally left the squadron in February, having been replaced by Kaiser Friedrich IIIs newly commissioned sister ship [...] The squadron began a major training cruise on 25 April; that day, while the ships were passing through the Danish straits, a serious boiler accident occurred aboard Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, <b>forcing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> back for repairs. Kaiser Friedrich III {{and the rest of}} the squadron continued into the North Sea, toward Scotland. They passed through the Pentland Firth on 29 April before turning south toward Ireland. The ships stopped briefly in Lough Swilly on 1 May before proceeding to Bantry Bay, where they anchored off Berehaven five days later. There, Prince Heinrich visited his British cousin, Prince Arthur, and the ships were received by the British Channel Squadron. The German vessels then steamed to Dublin, and then to the Isles of Scilly, where Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse rejoined the squadron. They returned to Dublin, where they were visited by Gerald Cadogan, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The ships finally began their return voyage to Germany on 24 May, and reached Kiel four days later.|$|E
500|$|Upon Italy's {{entrance}} into the Second World War on 10 June 1940, Bolzano {{was assigned to the}} 2nd Division in the 2nd Squadron, along with the two Trento-class cruisers. On 9 July, the ship took part in the Battle of Calabria; there, she led the line of Italian heavy cruisers as they engaged their British counterparts. She was hit by a salvo of three [...] shells at 16:05 that jammed her rudder to port, <b>forcing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> in a tight circle. The shells also hit her forward superfiring gun turret, though it was still able to fire. The hits had come from the light cruiser [...] After the two fleets disengaged, Italian aircraft misidentified the ship as a British vessel and attacked her, though they failed to score any hits. She reached La Spezia on 12 June, where her battle damage was repaired. By the night of 1112 November, Bolzano had been moved to Taranto; she was present during the raid on Taranto that night, but was not attacked by the British torpedo bombers. A wave of horizontal bombers was tasked with attacking Bolzano and the two Trentos, but their captains decided to hold their fire; as a result, the British aircraft were unable to locate the three cruisers in the darkness and they attacked other vessels.|$|E

Tragedy struck Myrt & Marge first in 1933, Vail was injured seriously in an automobile accident, <b>forcing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the show's writing over to a colleague named Charles Thomas, who wrote a story line having Myrt kidnapped by gangsters, allowing Vail to recuperate completely. An even greater tragedy occurred when Donna Damerel died on February 15, 1941, aged 28, while giving birth to her third son. Donna had done a Myrt & Marge performance hours before going into labor.|$|E

50|$|Walter Terrace, a {{civilian}} engineer and seemingly the sole civilian {{survivor of the}} colony, wakes up with no memory and is contacted by AMI, the Artificial Intelligence system controlling the colony, who enlists Walter's help in {{finding a way to}} stop the infection. Throughout his journey, Walter is also frequently contacted by Betty, a violent and unstable fellow survivor who often contacts Walter to alternatingly cajole, mock, and threaten him or otherwise comment on the situation. Besides Walter and Betty, the only human survivors on the colony are 50 corporate mercenaries under the command of Gregory Hart, a special representative recently sent by Solarix to provide oversight {{on the development of the}} colony. Hart's mercenaries are desperate and paranoid due to the situation and will shoot Walter on sight. Hart, who was already distrustful of AMI due to her status as an A.I., believes that AMI is responsible for creating the infection out of jealously against her human masters, and is therefore refusing to cooperate with AMI, <b>forcing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> to Walter for help.|$|E

5000|$|Once the {{imperial}} train arrived at Yecheng, the situation {{became even more}} tense, as an associate of Yang's, Kezhuhun Tianhe, was convinced that Emperor Fei would not be safe in his reign unless his two uncles were killed, and alternatively, Yan Zixian considered putting Grand Empress Dowager Lou, who still wielded much power as the clan matriarch, under house arrest, and <b>forcing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> her authorities to Empress Dowager Li.

The officials who were hurt by Yang's actions became disaffected and largely hoped that Gao Yan and Gao Zhan would take action and began {{to encourage them to}} do so. Yang considered sending Gao Yan and Gao Zhan outside the capital to be provincial governors, but Emperor Fei initially disagreed. Yang wrote a submission to Empress Dowager Li to ask her to consider, and she consulted her lady in waiting Li Changyi, who leaked the news to Grand Empress Dowager Lou. She informed the two princes, and they set up an ambush, with Gao Guiyan and the generals Heba Ren and Hulü Jin, at a ceremony where Gao Yan was to be named to a ceremonial post. Yang, Kezhuhun, Yan, Zheng, and Song Qindao were all severely battered and captured.|$|E

5000|$|The {{only chance}} for {{survival}} of the little group of American [...] "Jeep" [...] carriers and [...] "tin cans" [...] lay in running to the east long enough to launch what aircraft could be readied before fleeing to the south hoping that aid would arrive before their complete destruction. While the carriers launched all available aircraft to attack their numerous Japanese adversaries and then formed a rough circle as they turned toward Leyte Gulf, Hoel and her fellow destroyers Johnston and Heermann, worked feverishly to lay down a smoke screen to hide their [...] "baby flattops" [...] from the overwhelmingly superior enemy ships. At 07:06, when a providential rain squall helped to hide his carriers, Admiral Clifton Sprague boldly ordered his destroyers to attack the Japanese with torpedoes. Hoel instantly obeyed this order by heading straight for the nearest enemy battleship, , then 18,000 yd away. When she had closed to 14,000 yd she opened fire as she continued her race toward Kongōs 14 in guns. A hit on her bridge which knocked out all voice radio communication did not deflect her from her course toward the enemy until she had launched a half salvo of torpedoes at a range of 9,000 yd. Although Hoels torpedoes all failed to strike their target, they caused Kongō to lose ground in her pursuit of the carriers by <b>forcing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> sharply left and to continue {{to move away from}} her quarry until they had run their course. Minutes later Hoel suffered hits which knocked out three of her guns, stopped her port engine, and deprived her of her Mark-37 fire control director, FD radar, and Bridge steering control.|$|E
