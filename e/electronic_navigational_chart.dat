40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the principles underlying the World <b>Electronic</b> <b>Navigational</b> <b>Chart</b> Database (WEND) has been brought into question by the less than optimal service delivery models existing in 2009. It is contended that the delays {{in the provision of}} comprehensive <b>Electronic</b> <b>Navigational</b> <b>Chart</b> (ENC) services, {{partly as a result of}} real world challenges in generating the required international production capacity, have been the major factor in the growth of a large market in unofficial data services. However, the future course of electronic charting is now clearly pointing towards a model, recognizable as a WEND, but modified according to regional requirements. This paper reviews the challenges in the delivery of an early official integrated vector chart service aspiring to world coverage, launched by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office. A number of separate strands are examined, including the significant technical challenges in the translation of historic charted data into the new format and the provision of a robust supply chain from data acquisition to the ultimate delivery of data to the end user...|$|E

If 2 D chart data is used to build up an interactive 3 D scene, the change of the perspective leads to over-crowded displays and many occlusions. We developed a data management concept by defining a hierarchical topology and semantic groupings within the 2 D chart data. The hierarchy can be stored permanently in the charts, and {{does not affect the}} standard. The structure can also be used in other 3 D scenarios like city models if vector-based modelling in the 2 D chart is available; application scenarios are reduction of the complexity, reduction of the scene to interesting regions and semantic clustering of objects. 1...|$|R
