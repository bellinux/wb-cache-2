25|$|Domestic {{immersion}} heaters, usually {{rated at}} 3 kilowatts {{and on a}} 1.5-inch British Standard Pipe screwplug in the UK, run on the normal domestic electricity supply, but users may also {{take advantage of a}} cheaper, off-peak electricity tariff such as Economy 7 (in the UK). In a typical off-peak installation, a lower immersion heater is connected to the separately switched off-peak heating circuit and an upper heater is connected to the normal circuit via its own switch. The consumer then has the option to top up the available <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> at any time, rather than waiting for the cheaper supply to turn on (typically after midnight). A poorly insulated hot water cylinder will increase running costs because a consumer must pay for electricity used to replace lost heat.|$|E
25|$|Heated {{water in}} the suit forms an active {{insulation}} barrier to heat loss, but the temperature must be regulated within fairly close limits. If the temperature falls below about 32°C, hypothermia can result, and temperatures above 45°C can cause burn injury to the diver. The diver may not notice a gradual change in inlet temperature, {{and in the early}} stages of hypo- or hyperthermia, may not notice the deteriorating condition. The suit is loose fitting to allow unimpeded water flow. This causes a large volume of water (13 to 22 litres) to be held in the suit, which can impede swimming due to the added inertia. When controlled correctly, the hot water suit is safe, comfortable and effective, and allows the diver adequate control of thermal protection, however <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> failure can be life-threatening.|$|E

Using a water-to-water heat pump or an air-to-water heat pump in retrofitting can be particularly effective in hotels in subtropical and tropical regions. Retrofitting of <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> can significantly increase energy efficiency because chilled water can be a free by-product of the process producing <b>hot</b> <b>water.</b> The use of heat pumps in retrofitting not only helps in reducing the total operating costs, but also helps in downsizing the total installed cooling capacity of the chillers used for space cooling.

When needed, a <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> line, helium reclaim line, and/or video camera and lighting cables may be included. These components are neatly twisted into a multistrand cable, and are deployed as a single unit. The diver's end has underwater connectors for the electrical cables, and the air hoses are usually connected to the helmet, band mask, or bailout block by JIC fittings. A screw-gate carabiner or similar connector is provided on the strength member for attachment to the diver's harness, and may be used to lift the diver in an emergency. Similar connections are provided for attachment to the diving bell, if used, or to the surface gas panel and communications equipment.|$|E

50|$|Originally {{built as}} a {{colliery}} village in the mid-1920s, New Ollerton was once acclaimed in the Spectator magazine as 'an admirable industrial housing scheme' - {{also known as a}} 'model village'.

40|$|Abstract. The current thesis {{proposed}} {{the integration of}} air conditioners that exhaust heat with solar energy to enhance the overall efficiency of thermal energy conversion. The analysis of thermal storage tanks of different volumes revealed that a two-ton air conditioner operating for an hour produced double energy than normal sunshine for a day. With thermal storage tanks of fixed volume, the integration of air conditioners of different tons with solar energy indicated that air conditioners of less tons produced faster and more efficient energy conversion. Therefore, the current thesis proposed that the modification of condenser in domestic air conditioner into water-cooled condenser not only enhanced the energy efficiency of air conditioners but also increased <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> since <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> from air conditioners could be integrated into solar water heaters. By doing so, energy conservation and carbon reduction could be achieved...|$|R
