5|$|The Yugoslav Navy was {{defeated}} and its ships did not sail {{north of the}} Split Entrance again. The battle was the largest engagement of the Croatian Navy during the war. Two Croatian anti-aircraft gunners were killed in action {{on the island of}} Brač. According to Mladenić, the Yugoslav Navy lost 22 seamenincluding three aboard Mukostwo minesweepers and a patrol craft. The Yugoslav Air Force lost two aircraft but the pilots were rescued by a helicopter that sortied from Vis and picked them up from the sea. Croatian Navy divers later raised Mukos and she was towed to Šibenik by a Brodospas-owned tug. She was repaired and turned over to the Croatian Navy as OB-62 Šolta. Two civilians were killed and nine were wounded in the naval bombardment of Split. The bombardment damaged the Archaeological Museum, Split Municipality Building, Arena <b>Gripe,</b> Public Sanitation Institute, the Technical School, and the ferries Bartol Kašić and Vladimir Nazor, which were moored in the Port of Split. The two civilian fatalities were crew members of Vladimir Nazor.|$|E

25|$|In {{the decades}} since 5/4 GR {{first arrived in}} Bakloh, in 1963, Bakloh has lost its sheen, and the officer and {{the men of the}} Regiment appear no longer as keen on Bakloh {{as they were in the}} fifties. They {{complain}} that it is on a limb, and small and boring. As a result of the constant <b>gripe</b> against Bakloh, it has lost its 'asterisk' status. This is a cause of big disappointment for the 4 GR pensioners in Bakloh. Many older officers, Junior Commissioned Officers(JCOs), and men, especially those who started their regimental careers in Bakloh, are unaffected by those who grumble about Bakloh, and remain fond and attachment to Bakloh; and committed to the idea that Bakloh should have a Battalion from the Regiment to sustain the Bakloh legacy and take care of the regimental properties, remains, and the sizeable population of regiment's pensioners, and widows.|$|E
25|$|Set in {{the parish}} of St Giles—a notorious slum {{district}} that Hogarth depicted in several works around this time—Gin Lane depicts the squalor and despair of a community raised on gin. Desperation, death and decay pervade the scene. The only businesses that flourish serve the gin industry: gin sellers; a distiller (the aptly named Kilman); the pawnbroker where the avaricious Mr. <b>Gripe</b> greedily takes the vital possessions (the carpenter offers his saw and the housewife her cooking utensils) of the alcoholic residents of the street {{in return for a}} few pennies to feed their habit; and the undertaker, for whom Hogarth implies at least a handful of new customers from this scene alone. Most shockingly, the focus of the picture is a woman in the foreground, who, addled by gin and driven to prostitution by her habit—as evidenced by the syphilitic sores on her legs—lets her baby slip unheeded from her arms and plunge to its death in the stairwell of the gin cellar below. Half-naked, she has no concern for anything other than a pinch of snuff. This mother was not such an exaggeration as she might appear: in 1734, Judith Dufour reclaimed her two-year-old child from the workhouse where it had been given a new set of clothes; she then strangled it and left the infant's body in a ditch so that she could sell the clothes (for 1s. 4d.) to buy gin. In another case, an elderly woman, Mary Estwick, let a toddler burn to death while she slept in a gin-induced stupor. Such cases provided a focus for anti-gin campaigners such as the indefatigable Thomas Wilson and the image of the neglectful and/or abusive mother became increasingly central to anti-gin propaganda. Sir John Gonson, whom Hogarth featured in his earlier A Harlot's Progress, turned his attention from prostitution to gin and began prosecuting gin-related crimes with severity.|$|E

500|$|In 2009 it {{appeared}} that the submarine would be given to the Technical Museum in Zagreb under an agreement between mayor Milan Bandić and the government agencies, but this project was canceled due to the difficulty of transporting the [...] tall submarine through the city center to the museum. The Croatian Maritime Museum in Split also expressed interest in obtaining Velebit as a part of its display, especially considering it was built in Split and homeported in the city throughout its service career. The main obstacle to this option is that the Maritime Museum is located in the <b>Gripe</b> fortress; because the plans for moving the Maritime Museum to the more spacious port of Split have been put on hold, a new option that includes moving Velebit to the Military Museum that's being created in Zagreb, has also appeared.

500|$|Chuck Taylor from Billboard also praised [...] "That's the Way It Is". He {{wrote that}} Dion at last [...] "ups the tempo with the irresistible" [...] first single.

500|$|Complaints {{were raised}} on the first-person perspective, with Ryan Scott of GameSpy {{considered}} it a [...] "weird forced handicap". Phil Kollar of Game Informer expressed disappointment that the game prevents the player from moving while in first person view. The A.V. Club David Wolinsky found the pixel hunting sequences irritating, while Official Nintendo Magazine Chris Scullion similarly described them as the [...] "only truly horrible moments" [...] in the game. Critics responded poorly to the mechanic of power-up restriction; they derided it as a deviation from the series' tradition of item discovery, and even more strongly criticized it as nonsensical and condescending in terms of story. GamesRadar derided the game's linearity in comparison with Metroid Fusion, a game which took a similar approach. The website also found the enemies to be [...] "a largely unimpressive collection", a <b>gripe</b> which Edge also had; it wrote that [...] "truly testing enemies are only found in the last stretch". Other Ms short length was criticized by reviewers, by critics such as GameTrailers, which writes that the bonuses such as art galleries were not stimulating enough to entice replay value.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{two-dimensional}} graphics {{were among}} its most panned feature, with GamePro commenting that the [...] "flat battle areas, wimpy spells, and itty-bitty enemies will assault your eyes", citing the in-game animated cut scenes {{as the only}} saving grace. [...] Game Informer conversely declared that the animated interludes were grainy and often would not display in true fullscreen, but remarked that it was [...] "really a small <b>gripe</b> because Lunar has an entertaining story filled with enjoyable quips". [...] Gamers' Republic recognized the inferiority of Lunars graphics to current role-playing games, but nonetheless found them [...] "charming". GameSpot simply described the graphics as [...] "truly dated", adding that many of Lunars aesthetic qualities could be re-created on a Super Nintendo. Technology magazine Silicon Mag called the game a [...] "masterpiece", awarding it a 95% rating and declared it an asset to the game industry, calling it [...] "a game that will sell systems, with gamers actually buying PlayStations just to play it." [...] In 2000, Silver Star Story Complete ranked 22nd in IGN's list of top PlayStation games of all time, while in 2001 Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked it 75th on its list of the top 100 games of all time.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Griper</b> {{was by far}} the {{inferior}} of the two ships, being described as [...] "one of these paltry Gunbrigs.....utterly unfit for this service!" [...] (A.Parry; Parry of the Arctic [...] ). Their departure had previously been delayed as the condition of the <b>Griper</b> was described as being [...] "so crank as to cause apprehensions to be entertained {{for the safety of the}} officers and crew". She was so slow that she had to be towed by the Hecla part of the way across the Atlantic.However, they successfully traveled further West along the Northwest Passage than any European had previously achieved.

500|$|After {{reprisal}} from death, Davies felt {{further development}} {{was necessary for}} the character to continue {{as part of the}} drama; one of the first decisions the production team made was that [...] "we can't make this guy look like a sap any longer. He's got to be made aware of what's going on." [...] The events of the episode [...] "Meat", in which Rhys learns the real nature of Gwen's job, are seen by Davies as a [...] "rite of passage" [...] for the couple. Director Colin Teague highlights Rhys' [...] patience in relation to Gwen noting that [...] "he puts up with an awful lot from his wife to be". The second series also explores Rhys's insecurities and jealousies towards series protagonist Captain Jack Harkness, for whom a mutual sexual tension with Gwen was evident in the first series. Both Stephen James Walker and episode writer Catherine Tregenna felt that [...] "the triangle of relationships between Rhys, Gwen and Jack" [...] comprise [...] "the most interesting narrative territory explored in 'Meat'". Although actor Kai Owen feels that [...] "Rhys will always {{have a little bit of}} a <b>gripe</b> about Jack", he concedes that [...] "he respects him and he'll like him for looking after Gwen". Walker comments favourably on the interaction between Jack and Rhys in [...] "Meat" [...] in both its antagonistic and comedic forms, citing the scene in the truck where Rhys questions Jack as particularly effective. The two function as unusual literary foils for one another, insofar as their relationships with Gwen are concerned. In her critical essay Gwen's Evil Stepmother: Concerning Gloves and Magic Slippers, Valerie Estelle Frankel compares Rhys to Jack, likening the former to a [...] "sweet, kind handsome prince" [...] and the latter to a [...] "compelling trickster." [...] Whilst Eve Myles feels that [...] "Jack highlights how ordinary Rhys is", she states that it is precisely this ordinariness which makes Rhys a benefit to Gwen's strength of character.|$|E

Industry and jollity go hand in hand". The only business that is in trouble is the pawnbroker: Mr Pinch lives in the one poorly maintained, crumbling building in the picture. In contrast to his Gin Lane counterpart, the prosperous <b>Gripe,</b> who displays expensive-looking cups in his upper window (a sign of his flourishing business), Pinch displays only a wooden contraption, perhaps a mousetrap, in his upper window, while he is forced to take his beer through a window in the door, which suggests his business is so unprofitable as to put the man in fear of being seized for debt.

[...] Irwin loosely based the character of Marguerite on his mother ("unabashed and delightfully inappropriate") and his maternal grandmother ("a genteel, bun-haired lady of means").
