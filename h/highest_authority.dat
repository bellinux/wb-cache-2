5|$|These speculations {{cannot be}} proven without doubt {{but as a}} governor, Odaenathus {{would have been the}} <b>highest</b> <b>authority</b> in the {{province}} and above any legionary commander and provincial officials; this would make him the commander of the Roman forces in the province. Whatever the case may be, starting from 258, Odaenathus strengthened his position and extended his political influence in the region. By 260, Odaenathus held the rank, credibility and power to pacify the Roman east following the Battle of Edessa.|$|E

5|$|The BJP is the world's largest {{political}} party by primary membership, having 100 million registered members as of April 2015. The organisation of the BJP is strictly hierarchical, {{with the president}} being the <b>highest</b> <b>authority</b> in the party. Until 2012, the BJP constitution mandated that any qualified member could be national or state president for a single three-year term. This was amended {{to a maximum of}} two consecutive terms. Below the president is the national executive, which contains a variable number of senior leaders from across the country. It is the higher decision making body of the party. Its members are several vice-presidents, general-secretaries, treasurers and secretaries, who work directly with the president. An identical structure, with an executive committee led by a president, exists at the state, regional, district and local level.|$|E
5|$|The lengthy German defence {{prevented}} a swift Soviet breakthrough into Estonia {{and gave the}} underground National Committee of the Republic of Estonia enough time to attempt to re-establish Estonian independence. On 1 August 1944, the national committee pronounced itself Estonia's <b>highest</b> <b>authority</b> and on 18 September 1944, acting head of state Uluots appointed a new government led by Otto Tief. Over the radio in English, the government declared its neutrality in the war. The government issued two editions of the Riigi Teataja (State Gazette) but {{did not have time}} to distribute them. On 21 September, the national forces seized the government buildings in Toompea, Tallinn and ordered the German forces to leave. The flag of Estonia was hoisted at the tower of Pikk Hermann, to be removed by the Soviets four days later. The Estonian Government in Exile served to carry the continuity of the Estonian state forward until 1992, when it handed its credentials over to the incoming President, Lennart Meri.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 309, Maximinus resumed {{persecution}} by issuing letters to provincial governors and his praetorian prefect, the <b>highest</b> <b>authority</b> in judicial proceedings after the emperor, demanding that Christians conform to pagan customs. His new legislation called for another general sacrifice, coupled with a general offering of libations. It was even more systematic than the first, allowing no exceptions for infants or servants. Logistai (curatores), strategoi, duumviri, and tabularii, who kept the records, {{saw to it that}} there were no evasions. Maximinus introduced some innovations to the process, making him the only known persecuting emperor to have done so. This edict now required food sold in the marketplaces to be covered in libation. Maximinus sent sentries to stand guard at bathhouses and city gates to ensure that all customers sacrificed. He issued copies of the fictitious Acts of Pilate to encourage popular hatred of Christ. Prostitutes confessed, under judicial torture, to having engaged in debaucheries with Christians. Bishops were reassigned to work as stable boys for the Imperial horse guard or keepers of the Imperial camels.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi allowed the {{emergence}} of the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi and Crown Prince Surendra onto the political stage. To consolidate her political influence and see her own son, rather than the heir apparent, Surendra, succeed on the throne, Rajya Laxmi had obtained pardon for Sherjung Thapa and other jailed members of Thapa family. It was only after this that Bhimsen Thapa managed to get a symbolic funeral rite in August 1841. Thus, the Nepalese court was split into three factions centered around the King, the Queen, and the Crown Prince. Fateh Jung and his administration supported the King, the Thapas supported the Junior Queen, while the Pandes supported the Crown Prince. The resurgent Thapa coalition succeeded in sowing animosity between Fateh Jung's ministry and the Pande coalition, who were swiftly imprisoned. During his two years in power, Fateh Jung was able to maintain a rule of law in the country; however, after the incarceration of the Pandes, nobody could rein in the worsening sadistic tendencies, sometimes with fatal consequences, of Surendra, who was then still a minor. Under immense pressure from the Queen and the nobility, along with the backing from army and the general populace, the King in January 1843 handed the <b>highest</b> <b>authority</b> of the state to his Junior Queen, Rajya Laxmi, curtailing both his own and his son's power.|$|E
5|$|With Max Capricorn dead, the Heavenly Host divert to {{the next}} <b>highest</b> <b>authority,</b> the Doctor, and aid him in quickly {{reaching}} the bridge. Together with Midshipman Frame, he uses {{the heat from the}} entry into the Earth's atmosphere to restart the ship's auxiliary engines. The ship stabilises and narrowly avoids a collision with Buckingham Palace. The Doctor then realizes that Astrid was wearing a teleport bracelet when she fell into the engine. In an emergency, the teleport bracelets were programmed to hold a person's molecular pattern in stasis until it can be recovered. The Doctor frantically attempts to retrieve Astrid's pattern, but the machine is too badly damaged. The Doctor reluctantly allows the ghostly remains of Astrid's atoms to dissipate into space. As the surviving passengers wait for rescue, the Doctor and Mr. Copper, who would otherwise be sent to prison for committing fraud {{in order to get a}} job with the company, teleport to Earth and find that the TARDIS has landed unharmed in an snowy field, thrown from the ship after the collision. Mr. Copper is left to live on Earth with a credit card preloaded with £1,000,000, thanks to the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|Organisationally, {{the commune}} of Pichilemu has a mayor–council form of government. This {{provides}} for a commune-wide elected mayor serving in an executive role, {{as well as a}} city council serving in a legislative role. The mayor, as the <b>highest</b> <b>authority</b> of the commune of Pichilemu, has the responsibility to direct, manage and supervise the work of the municipality, and legally represents the commune. The mayor is also responsible for administrating the commune's financial resources, and municipal and national goods of public use, presides the local city council, and has the power to delegate his work to other functionaries of the local government, which he may appoint. Additionally, the mayor may give a public account of his gesture to the city council every year, usually in April; an extract of his account may be published to the community. If the mayor dies in office, resigns, or is unable to carry out his/her duties, a councilor may be elected by the city council to replace the former mayor. In the meantime, the municipal secretary may take office as acting mayor. This has happened several times in Pichilemu: following the resignation of René Maturana Maldonado in April 1992, municipal secretary Gustavo Parraguez Galarce took over his office since, at the time, there were no councilors; in November 1998, mayor Jorge Vargas González was convicted of illegally giving a driver's license, and the city council chose councilor Carlos Leyton Labarca until Vargas González resumed his duties in November 1999.|$|E
