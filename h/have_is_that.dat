25|$|Some {{proteins}} perform largely structural roles. For instance, {{movements of}} the proteins actin and myosin ultimately {{are responsible for the}} contraction of skeletal muscle. One property many proteins <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they specifically bind to a certain molecule or class of moleculesthey may be extremely selective in what they bind. Antibodies are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule. In fact, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which uses antibodies, {{is one of the most}} sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various biomolecules. Probably the most important proteins, however, are the enzymes. Virtually every reaction in a living cell requires an enzyme to lower the activation energy of the reaction. These molecules recognize specific reactant molecules called substrates; they then catalyze the reaction between them. By lowering the activation energy, the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 1011 or more; a reaction that would normally take over 3,000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme. The enzyme itself is not used up in the process, and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates. Using various modifiers, the activity of the enzyme can be regulated, enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole.|$|E
500|$|The Confederate {{point of}} view for the battle was much {{different}} from the reports of the Union officers. Confederate General Jones reported [...] "The information I <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the expedition started from Kanawha 1,200 or 1,300 strong, and that when it reached Fayetteville, on the return, it numbered but 500, only 300 of whom were mounted. The commander (Colonel Toland) and several other officers were killed, the second in command, Colonel Powell, and other officers wounded and captured. They admit a loss of more than 60 killed and wounded; it was probably much greater. Their dead bodies were scattered along the roads and mountain paths. [...] Our loss, as reported to me, was 1 captain and 5 men killed, and about double that number wounded." [...] The Reverend J. M. Wharey, who fought as a citizen of Wytheville during the raid, wrote [...] "...there was no telling what damage they would have done. Had Colonel Toland lived, the lead mines, the salt works, and the railroad bridges near Wytheville would have been at their mercy. So our little battle disconcerted their plans and the raid was a complete failure." ...|$|E
500|$|Bain Capital's {{leveraged}} buyouts sometimes led to layoffs, either {{soon after}} acquisition or later after {{the firm had}} concluded its role. Exactly how many jobs Bain Capital added compared to those lost because of these investments and buyouts is unknown, owing {{to a lack of}} records and Bain Capital's penchant for privacy on behalf of itself and its investors. Maximizing the value of acquired companies and the return to Bain's investors, not job creation, was the firm's primary investment goal. Bain Capital's acquisition of Ampad exemplified a deal where it profited handsomely from early payments and management fees, even though the subject company itself later went into bankruptcy. Dade Behring was another case where Bain Capital received an eightfold return on its investment, but the company itself was saddled with debt and laid off over a thousand employees before Bain Capital exited (the company subsequently went into bankruptcy, with more layoffs, before recovering and prospering). Referring to the layoffs that sometimes occurred, Romney said in 2007: [...] "Sometimes the medicine is a little bitter but it is necessary {{to save the life of}} the patient. My job was to try and make the enterprise successful, and in my view the best security a family can <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the business they work for is strong." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{distinguishing}} feature is how {{males and females}} process information and then recall what was presented to them. Females tend to remember nonverbal cues and associate {{the meaning of a}} discussion with gestures. Since males follow verbal cues they react more to the facts and actual words within a discussion to recall what was said, but fluctuations in the speaker's voice helps them maintain the memories. Another difference that sets males and females apart is recalling someone's voice. [...] They tend to recall information they have read, for instance, lists of objects are better recalled for men than women. The only similarity they <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when emotional words are used or an emotional tone is produced, males and females tend to recall those changes.|$|E
2500|$|Tunstall's North American break {{came when}} American Idol {{contestant}} Katharine McPhee contacted her asking to use [...] "Black Horse and the Cherry Tree" [...] as her {{choice for a}} Billboard-themed week. At the time, the song was No. 79 on the Billboard charts. Tunstall had not been shy with her opinions regarding shows like Idol, saying [...] "The major problem I <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's completely controlled. They're told what to say. They're told how to sing." [...] She chose to license the song as she felt that [...] "no one on that show told Katharine McPhee to sing my song because no one knew it". Tunstall's belief was correct—the song was suggested to McPhee by Billboard columnist and author Fred Bronson.|$|E
2500|$|Musically, psychobilly {{is rooted}} {{primarily}} in two genres: late 1970s punk rock and 1950s American rockabilly. Tiger Army frontman Nick 13 explains: [...] "The number-one misconception people <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> psychobilly {{is the same}} thing as rockabilly. Rockabilly is on the family tree, but it's a totally different sound and attitude." [...] Psychobilly progenitors The Cramps acknowledge their music's deep roots in American blues, rhythm and blues, and traditional rock and roll. Alternative Press writer Ryan Downey notes that contemporary psychobilly also draws from other rock genres and subgenres: [...] "Driven by the rhythmic pounding of a stand-up bass, the music swings with the snarl of punk rock while sometimes thrashing alongside speed metal or crashing headlong into country icon Hank Williams." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pike {{are capable}} of [...] "fast start" [...] movements, which are sudden high-energy bursts of {{unsteady}} swimming. Many other fish exhibit this movement as well. Most fish use this mechanism to avoid life-threatening situations. For the pike, however, it is a tool used to capture prey from their sedentary positions. They flash out in such bursts and capture their prey. These fast starts terminate when the pike has reached terminal velocity. During such motions, pike make [...] "S" [...] conformations while swimming at high rates. To decelerate, they, simply make a [...] "C" [...] conformation, exponentially slowing down their speed {{so that they can}} [...] "stop". An interesting behavioral trait that pike <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they have short digestion times and long feeding periods. They can undergo many of these fast bursts to collect as much prey as they can. Pike are least active during the night.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{prominent}} area is Amberes Street, home to Mexico City’s gay community. [...] Homosexuality on {{this street}} {{and the rest of}} Zona Rosa is fairly open with hand holding and kissing among same-sex couples. [...] During Gay Pride, the nightclubs, discothèques and bars of Zona Rosa fill with members of the LGBT community starting at midday. [...] Many businesses, whether they cater to gay people or not, decorate with rainbow colored balloons, streamers and other items. Despite the crowds police presence is not significantly heightened. The parade marches along Paseo de la Reforma from Puerta de los Leones to the Glorieta de la Palma, with the entire stretch completely closed to traffic for the event. The city have even participated offering free AIDS tests to attendees. However, not all residents and business owners are happy with the area’s gay reputation. Some business owners complain that open displays of affection drives away tourists and other visitors. [...] While male and female prostitution exists in Zona Rosa, there have been complaints of the prostitution of minors, despite efforts since the 1990s to eradicate it. However, some in the gay community state that the prostitution of minors is not the issue that neighbors say it is, rather, the problem some <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is a gay community here.|$|E

2500|$|Singh, Booth and 5 other tenants from 4–5 Gray's Inn Square, {{together}} with 16 barristers from other chambers, set up Matrix Chambers in 2000. With {{the formation of}} Matrix, none of the five silks signed up to Matrix {{at the time was}} estimated to earn much more than £200,000 a year, Singh however was believed to be the biggest earner of them all. One senior clerk said: [...] "The problem they will <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Rabinder Singh is by far their biggest earner. He will be carrying the rent which could cause a lot of internal politics." [...] Singh has since gone on to be named the Barrister of the Year by the Lawyer Magazine. In 2001 and was appointed Queen's Counsel in 2002 earning him the professional title of 'Silk' and being styled with the suffix QC. He is acknowledged as a Leading Silk in Administrative and Public law; Singh is described by Chambers & Partners Legal 500 2006 as being [...] "known for his expertise in cross-disciplinary work" [...] and as [...] "one of the most impressive younger silks" [...] in the area of Administrative and Public laws.
