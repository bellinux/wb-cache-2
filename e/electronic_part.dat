50|$|CALCE {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of research in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). CALCE formed the first collaborative research effort to address PHM applications. Through the work of their PHM Consortium, CALCE has developed a new paradigm for reliability prediction based on prognostics whereby sensor data is integrated into models that enable in-situ assessment of the deviation of a product from its expected normal operating condition. Additionally, CALCE has developed a prognostics roadmap that will be included in the ITRI semiconductor roadmap. In the field of <b>Electronic</b> <b>Part</b> Supply Chain Management, CALCE is the preeminent technical organization for thermal up-rating, counterfeit <b>electronic</b> <b>part</b> management, and <b>electronic</b> <b>part</b> obsolescence forecasting and management. CALCE developed the concept of up-rating, a process that mitigates the risk associated with using semiconductor devices outside manufacturer specifications. CALCE also developed the first quantitative analysis of lifetime buy sizes for electronic parts, which has allowed electronics integrators to reduce their stock inventories and save money.|$|E

A load cell is an electronic device {{that is used to}} convert a force into an electrical signal. Through a mechanical arrangement, the force being sensed deforms a strain gauge. The strain gauge converts the deformation (strain) to electrical signals. The software and electronics of the force gauge convert the voltage of the load cell into a force value that is displayed on the instrument.|$|E
