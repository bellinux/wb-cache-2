Eventually, bassist Joshua Woodard and Westfall recruited drummer Alex Shelnutt only three days before going on tour. Upon being asked, Shelnutt's response was [...] "Ask my mom", as he was 15 at the time.

500|$|Ramsey {{remained}} {{his usual}} self during the celebrations: not joining in, but rather opting {{to let his}} players soak up their achievement. [...] He is the only England manager ever to have won the World Cup. [...] Bobby Charlton praised Ramsey and his approach to managing the England team to World Cup victory: [...] "He was professional to his fingertips and as popular with the players as any manager I've ever seen. He was a winner and without Alf Ramsey England would not have won the World Cup in 1966. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> our proudest moment." [...] Nobby Stiles agreed: [...] "You did it, Alf, we'd have been nothing without you." ...|$|E
500|$|The North County Times {{referred}} to him observing, [...] "Page {{is one of the}} most recognizable artists in the entertainment industry for his iconic designs." [...] Director of exhibitions and collections at the Oceanside Museum of Art, Teri Sowell, reflected of the exhibition featuring Page's work to The San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "These creatures are so embedded in our minds, we take them for granted. It's really handcrafted art." [...] Film director J. J.

500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that we would get together. We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something going on there. We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me."

2500|$|The episode {{received}} unanimous acclaim {{from television}} critics. The Futon Critic named it the second best episode of 2006, saying [...] "David Simon did it again. He made us think these four boys - Namond (Julito McCullum), Michael (Tristan Wilds), Randy (Maestro Harrell) and Duquan (Jermaine Crawford) - could {{have at the}} very least a future and ripped the rug out from under nearly all of them. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> a voice in Bodie (JD Williams), who rallied against the current state of [...] "the game," [...] only to silence it. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> a saintly mayor (Aidan Gillen) only to muzzle him with bureaucracy.

2500|$|Unlike President Reagan and Secretary of State Shultz, Weinberger did {{not regard}} any of Gorbachev's actions—whether it was perestroika or glasnost—as reassuring {{indicators}} of his stated intentions. [...] "Not only did Gorbachev {{give up all}} of the Soviet 'non-negotiable' demands , but <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> precisely the kind of treaty that the President had sought for seven years. That act of course does not mean—any more than does the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan—that the USSR has given up its long-term aggressive designs." [...] Initially, Reagan's views were in line with Weinberger's views, but he began to reevaluate his perception of Gorbachev's intentions in 1987, the year Gorbachev accepted the U.S. proposal on INF.|$|E
