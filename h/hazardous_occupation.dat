25|$|In 2003, 1,400 minors {{were arrested}} for prostitution, 14% of whom were younger than 14 years old. A study {{conducted}} by the International Labor Union indicated that boys are at a higher risk of being trafficked into agricultural work, the drug trade, and petty crime.

In 2004, the Department of Labor found 1,087 minors employed in situations that violated <b>hazardous</b> <b>occupation</b> standards.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, adult obesity has {{increased}} in the United States, especially among the Hispanic/Latino population. In 2010, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Environmental and Safety News, reported that younger workers, ages 18 to 19 years of age, worked in the most high-risk occupations such as agriculture, construction, fishing, and manufacturing. The reported fatality rates for these occupations were 5. 6 times greater for Hispanic workers compared to other race/ethnicity groups reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2013. This study determined whether obesity contributed to workplace injury or mortality in <b>hazardous</b> <b>occupations,</b> using federal, state, and independent national databases. The independent variable was obesity, the dependent variable was injury in <b>hazardous</b> <b>occupations.</b> In addition, age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic level, educational level, and cultural context were used as mediating variables. The target population included all workers ages 18 to 65 years of age in <b>hazardous</b> <b>occupations.</b> Analysis of databases from NHANES, BRFSS, NIOSH, OSHA, and the BLS was conducted using descriptive statistics for frequency of the mediating variables 2 ̆ 7 relationship to workplace injury. This study highlighted the prevalence of obesity in the Hispanic/Latino population and increased incidence of workplace injury in <b>hazardous</b> <b>occupations,</b> but found no significant relationship between the variables using the BFRSS Web Enabled Analysis Tool for linear regression and cross-tabulation. Establishing a relationship between obesity and increased injury for the Hispanic/Latino population in high-risk occupations for preventative measures will enhance positive social change within this underrepresented population in research...|$|R

50|$|The {{yard was}} set {{to the south of}} the main line from Doncaster and Barnsley.

50|$|The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) has {{different}} standards for children working in agriculture {{than in any}} other industry. The Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs estimates that there are between 400,000 and 500,000 children working in the farming industry. Children as young as 12 years of age work in the fields. There is no maximum number of hours worked a day, aside from being outside of school hours. They are exposed to the sun, harmful pesticides and hazardous conditions. Children are in up to three times greater danger of exposure to pesticides than adults due to their size and stage of development. The fatality rate is six times that in any other industry: children account for 20% of all deaths on farms. Although agriculture is a <b>hazardous</b> <b>occupation,</b> no statistics are maintained on child laborers and serious accidents.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional {{farming is}} a <b>hazardous</b> <b>occupation</b> with {{particular}} risks that often take {{their toll on}} the health of human laborers. Such risks include: exposure to infectious diseases such as malaria and schistosomes, exposure to toxic chemicals commonly used as pesticides and fungicides, confrontations with dangerous wildlife such as venomous snakes, and the severe injuries that can occur when using large industrial farming equipment. Whereas the traditional farming environment inevitably contains these risks (particularly in the farming practice known as [...] "slash and burn"), vertical farming - because the environment is strictly controlled and predictable - reduces some of these dangers. Currently, the American food system makes fast, unhealthy food cheap while fresh produce is less available and more expensive, encouraging poor eating habits. These poor eating habits lead to health problems such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. The increased availability and subsequent lower cost of fresh produce would encourage healthier eating.|$|E
5000|$|Pearl-shell diving was a <b>hazardous</b> <b>occupation</b> and {{fatalities}} were high. One source suggests over 1,000 divers {{lost their}} lives in Torres Strait to [...] "the bends", from drowning or through shark attack. Thursday Island Cemetery contains between 600 and 700 graves bearing Japanese names. One authority records that most Japanese divers professed to be Anglicans, so that they could be buried at the Divers' Cemetery within the Thursday Island Cemetery. Certainly there was a strong Japanese presence within the Anglican community on Thursday Island. A Japanese school had been established by the Japanese community on the Anglican church precinct in Douglas Street by 1900, and the Japanese contributed to fund-raising for building the Church of England Parish Institute (1902-03) and various additions to the Quetta Memorial Cathedral Church in the 1890s and early 1900s.In 1979, the Monument Building Committee of Japan erected a memorial/shrine in the Thursday Island Cemetery, to honour the hundreds of Japanese who worked, lived and died in the Torres Strait between 1878 and 1941. A resident of Japan established a trust of about $100,000 to ensure the future maintenance of the Japanese gravestones.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, one's {{cultural}} knowledge base, or lack thereof, can {{be detrimental}} {{to the effectiveness of}} communication, particularly when communicating warnings or risk factors. Considering how differing knowledge paradigms as a result of cultural factors can prompt people to respond {{in a variety of ways}} to different rhetorical strategies, particularly when communicating messages containing warnings of hazards or risks, understanding culture must be a priority in technical translation. One researcher found that a variance of definition of terms and inconsistent paradigms of cultural knowledge highlight the need for a new delineation of what technical writers consider as the target audience while communicating risk factors. What might be appropriate for one audience must be reconsidered for a culturally different audience. Looking at a specific example concerning the <b>hazardous</b> <b>occupation</b> of mining, one piece of research demonstrates how different cultures different perceptions about safety information. Comparing risk communication in mining in the United States and the United Kingdom, the researcher discovered variations among the perceptions of who is responsible for promoting safety in the workplace. While one culture felt that the user or worker was responsible for promoting his or her own safety in the workplace, another culture perceived the science behind the process or document to be responsible for the promotion of safety. As risks, warnings, or cautions are often important components of a technical document in need of translation, the technical translator will understand how such cultural differences can affect the effectiveness of the translated message. Avoiding assumptions about a culture and allowing one's own knowledge base to consider more diverse populations will create more effective cross-cultural communication not only when working with risky environments, but in general communication as well.|$|E
