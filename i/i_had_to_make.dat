25|$|Also in the 1230s, Barnim I {{had sold}} the {{southern}} Uckermark between Templin and Angermünde to the margraves, and renounced his claims on the Barnim and Teltow areas. In the subsequent Treaty of Landin (Hohenlandin) in 1250, Barnim I formally accepted Brandenburgian overlordship and ceded the northern Uckermark to Brandenburg, but in turn received Johann's part of Wolgast {{and managed to}} rescind the succession clause of Kremmen. Barnim <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> further territorial concessions when Brandenburg established her Neumark ("New March") along the Warthe (Warta) river {{in the second half}} of the 13th century, and in 1267 married Mechthild, daughter of Otto III of Brandenburg.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} in the German daily Die Welt on April 24, 2015, concerning the Fourteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Burke renewed his criticism on German Cardinal Walter Kasper, whose “merciful” solution for remarried divorcees who wish to receive communion was discussed at the 2014 Extraordinary Synod. “We are bound by the Magisterium. But some Synod Fathers, above all Cardinal Kasper, want to change it. So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> myself very clear. Clashes at Synods, incidentally, are nothing unusual. Think of the early Councils, the Arian heresy, for instance, when Athanasius even became physically aggressive”, Burke recalled. He also recalled that Pope John Paul II had ruled out women’s ordination “once and for all”.|$|E

All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this?

He continued there for 17 years. According to Crane's daughter, at Rochester's annual auto show his dealership's exhibit featured a pool table at which Crane would run balls while answering questions. [...] "Working" [...] for a living was purely a choice of survival. In an interview with Sports Illustrated in 1969, Crane said, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a choice between selling cars and playing pool, I'd choose pool...

500|$|After the 1983–84 season, Olajuwon {{debated whether}} {{to stay in}} college or declare early for the NBA draft. At that time (before the NBA Draft Lottery was {{introduced}} in 1985), the first pick was awarded by coin flip. Olajuwon recalled: [...] "I really believed that Houston {{was going to win}} the coin flip and pick the number 1 draft choice, and I really wanted to play in Houston so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> that decision (to leave early)." [...] His intuition proved correct, and a lucky toss placed Houston ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers. Olajuwon was considered the top amateur prospect in the summer of 1984 over fellow collegians and future NBA stars Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton, and was selected first overall by the Rockets in the 1984 NBA draft.|$|E

Grey told PopEater [...] "I wrote the demo initially for myself because I thought, ‘Oh, I have this big song, and now I {{have a little bit of}} a launching pad to put out my own stuff." [...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the decision if I was going to let them have it or not.

500|$|As a child, Fonda {{suffered}} from a poor self-image and {{lack of confidence in}} her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. On the subject, Fonda said [...] "I was raised in the ‘50s. I was taught by my father [...] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E

Clapton said he got [...] "a phone call on the day we were to leave and he said that someone had asked him to do that concert and it was that night! So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the airport in an hour." [...] The group had two rehearsals: one was during the transatlantic flight from London to Toronto, and the other shortly before appearing on stage at the actual festival. Lennon said the group [...] "didn't know what to play", as they had not previously performed together. Also on the flight, Lennon gained the confidence, that when he got back to England, to leave the Beatles. Lennon told this to Clapton, and shortly afterwards, to the Beatles' then-manager, Allen Klein.|$|E
500|$|American street artist Fairey guest {{starred in}} [...] "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] as himself.

Fairey has said that The Simpsons {{has been one of}} his favorite television shows since the early 1990s because of its [...] "blend of humor and social commentary", and he felt [...] "deeply honored" [...] to be included in an episode. Fairey wrote on his website that [...] "Part of being on The Simpsons, is you’re being honored as a reference point in culture." [...] He described the plot of the episode as [...] "great", adding that the staff members of the show [...] "were kind enough to indulge a couple of my dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed (even though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> fun of myself to do so)." [...] This was Fairey's first acting performance. Street artists English, Scharf, and Conal also guest starred in the episode as themselves.|$|E
500|$|Berry {{was famous}} for his {{attention}} to detail and preparation, which he used to overcome his physical limitations. Considered slow for a wide receiver, he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds. Rather than speed, he was renowned for his precise pass patterns and sure hands; he rarely dropped passes, and he fumbled only once in his career. He would squeeze Silly Putty constantly to strengthen his hands. He and Unitas regularly worked after practice and developed the timing and knowledge of each other's abilities that made each more effective. The reason for this, according to Berry, was that the two did not think on the same wavelength. [...] "Every season we had {{to start all over}} on our timing, especially the long ball," [...] said Berry. [...] "He knew he had to release the ball when I was eighteen yards from scrimmage for me to receive it thirty-eight yards out. I knew <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> my break in those first eighteen yards and get free within 2.8 seconds." [...] He also relied on shifty moves, and by his count, he had 88 different moves to get open, all of which he practiced every week.|$|E

[...] After Boddy began a crusade against crime and corruption, he weathered harassment by police and politicians, circulation rose, and the paper was soon showing a profit. Boddy also streamlined operations and stabilized the paper's management. During the first six years of Boddy's ownership, the Daily News maintained a conservative editorial policy. By 1932, Boddy had dropped the word [...] "Illustrated" [...] from the name of the paper. He was a personal supporter of Herbert Hoover's bid for reelection. Los Angeles newspaper owners met and decided that, with all newspaper owners supporting Hoover, one paper had to support Democratic candidate and New York governor Franklin Roosevelt, and Boddy and the Daily News volunteered for the job. The day after the election, which saw Roosevelt elected, Boddy turned to his city editor and said of the voters: [...] "They have made a terrible mistake. I helped them do it.

500|$|More {{than one}} scene proved {{problematic}} for Breezy {{during the filming}} of the episode, as the decontamination room set was an enclosed four wall set, meaning that in the scene where Archer rubs down Porthos with decontamination gel, Breezy's trainer Scott Rowe couldn't be on the set with her. Normally {{he would have been}} behind the camera assisting the director by ensuring the dog is looking wherever the scene required. He hoped that with him off the set, that Breezy would look where required and not directly at the camera. In order to prepare for the scene where Porthos leaps out of an immersion tank and into Archer's arms, Rowe had a mock-up created so he could practice it with Breezy. He said that [...] "By the time we went into it on that one day to prep on set with Scott, she was jumping out of it into my arms, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that she's going to jump out and do it into Scott's arms." [...] In the final scene, not only did Breezy leap into Bakula's arms, but she also licked him repeatedly on the face. This wasn't due to training, but because they wiped food on Bakula's face.|$|E

There were many times that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a film quickly. At those times, I kept entertainment-value in mind.

He filmed Ban Geum-ryeon in 1975, but it was banned at the time, and not released until 1981, with 40 minutes of footage censored. The government also coerced Kim into making an anti-Communist propaganda film. The resulting film, Love of Blood Relations (1976), transcended the bounds of propaganda by portraying the communist agent as one of Kim's typical femme fatale characters. Kim later commented, [...] "North or south, capitalist or communist, ideology is far less interesting to me than the things that divide the sexes." ...|$|E
