5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand for use <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> fruit market.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{the ecology}} of the Chittenango ovate amber snail are fairly recent. It is an herbivorous species which lives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> spray zone of the Chittenango Falls, in {{partially}} sunlit areas with lush herbaceous growth. Several parameters appear to be influential in its habitat selection, namely humidity, substrate, temperature, vegetation, and water quality. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is a hermaphroditic species, and its mating season is from May through July. It lays egg clusters, each one containing an average of 8 to 14 eggs, at the base of plants, under matted vegetation, or in loose, wet soil. Maturity is reached in five to eight months, and its life span is roughly 2.5 years. Some of its predators include insects, amphibians, mammals, birds, and occasionally other snails.|$|E

25|$|The {{offspring}} remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> {{water until}} {{they are ready to}} migrate to the ocean as smolts. In a few years, the surviving adults return, climb the fish ladder, and reach their spawning ground to continue the life cycle. Of the millions of young fish born, only a relative few survive to adulthood. Causes of death include natural predators, commercial and sport fishing, disease, low stream flows, poor water quality, flooding, and concentrated developments along streams and lakes.|$|E

25|$|There {{are other}} tactics. Dippers forage {{underwater}} in fast-moving streams. Common grackles {{have been observed}} to follow farmers’ plows to glean the grubs exposed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> soil. Similarly, {{on the island of}} Borneo, the Bornean ground-cuckoo will follow wild pigs and sun bears as they turn up soil while foraging in the forest. Brewer's blackbirds are often seen in parking lots, where they pick off dead insects from car grilles. Some hummingbirds are known to take prey items from spiderwebs.|$|E
25|$|In 1855 Osborn, who {{had been}} one of the charter {{officers}} of the Illinois Central two years earlier, visited the Highlands to take <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> air and scenic beauty of the area. He enjoyed his visit so much that he decided to buy the property where Castle Rock and its associated properties now stands. He and his family spent summers in Wing and Wing until the castle was completed the year before he retired from the railroad industry as president of the Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad. He lived there until his death in 1894, devoting his time and money to philanthropic activities in New York.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} be able to survive in both fresh and salt water also gives another benefit that has been driven by evolution. Because the {{majority}} of sharks are only able to survive in salt water, the bull shark has evolved to have their offspring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> water where other sharks cannot enter. The freshwater acts as a protective area where the young are able to grow and mature without the threat of larger sharks preying on the younger bull sharks. This is an explanation for the behavior that is observed from the Bull sharks as to why there would be any reason for the adult bull shark to ever travel into a freshwater area despite being able to tolerate the high salinity of marine water.|$|E

25|$|Until 1970, mercury was {{not listed}} as a harmful chemical, {{according}} to the United States Federal Water Quality Administration. Within {{the past ten years}} mercury has become more apparent in water tests. Mercury compounds have been used in paper mills to prevent slime from forming during their production, and chemical companies have used mercury to separate chlorine from brine solutions. Studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency have shown that when the mercury comes in contact with many of the bacteria and compounds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> water, it forms the compound methyl mercury, which has a much greater impact on human health than elemental mercury due to a higher propensity for absorption. This form of mercury is not detrimental to a majority of fish types, but is very detrimental to people and other wildlife animals who consume the fish. Mercury has been known for health related problems such as birth defects in humans and animals, and the near extinction of eagles in the Great Lakes region.|$|E

500|$|Some {{species of}} termite {{practice}} fungiculture. They maintain a [...] "garden" [...] of specialised fungi of genus Termitomyces, which are nourished by the excrement of the insects.

Molecular {{evidence suggests that the}} family Macrotermitinae developed agriculture about 31 million years ago. It is assumed that more than 90 percent of dry wood in the semiarid savannah ecosystems of Africa and Asia are reprocessed by these termites. Originally living in the rainforest, fungus farming allowed them to colonise the African savannah and other new environments, eventually expanding into Asia.|$|E

500|$|Eve drew {{criticism}} for its formulaic writing, and the lead's poor performance. The show was included {{on a list}} by Ebony's Kevin L.

Arianna Davis of Refinery29 negatively compared Eve to 1990s black sitcoms, and determined {{that it was a}} part of the [...] "rollout of campy shows [...] that felt less like purposeful programming and more like cheap attempts at copying a successful advertising model". The Los Angeles Times Mimi Avins felt that the show lacked the spark and the writing quality of Sex and the City, identifying Eve as its weakest link. She felt that Eve did not show [...] "the acting ability or high-voltage charisma that vaulted Will Smith from rapper to television star" [...] <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fresh</b> Prince of Bel-Air. During her review of the original pilot, Melanie McFarland wrote that the sitcom lacked any potential due to Eve's poor performance on top of the [...] "errible scenery, cheap costumes and a few glaring miscasts". Eve's decision to distance the series from her identity as a rapper was questioned by Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant, who felt that the character of Shelly could have used [...] "the personality charge" [...] from Eve's life. Despite finding Eve a charismatic presence, Catlin felt that her acting, along with that of Ali Landry, was poorly-developed. Echoing Catlin's assessment, the San Francisco Gates Tim Goodman was critical of Eve and Landry's performance. Goodman also wrote that the show was an example of [...] "the worst writing on television", citing its homophobic jokes and its reliance on clichés.|$|E
