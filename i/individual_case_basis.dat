40|$|Background: There is an {{increase}} in the incidence of traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) due to increasing urbanization and rapid spurt in the number of motor vehicles on the road. Despite early presentation and ease of diagnosis the visual outcomes in TON are still limited. There is also significant confusion about the timing, dose and efficacy of steroid treatment in its management. Purpose: To provide a clinical update of {{the pros and cons of}} steroid therapy for TON. Design: The paper is a retrospective review of the currently available literature in the English language indexed in PubMed. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted by the authors using the following terms: Traumatic optic neuropathy, megadose, steroids, methylprednisolone. Relevant original articles, review articles, and case reports related to the topic of discussion were evaluated and discussed in the paper. Results: There is no prospective randomized control trial evaluating the effect of steroids in TON. There are varying reports on the effect of steroid therapy from significant improvement to no difference compared to observation. Conclusion: The decision to give steroids to patients with TON has to be on an <b>individual</b> <b>case</b> to <b>case</b> <b>basis</b> and must involve informed consent from the patient. There are documented advantages and disadvantages of steroid therapy and a prospective, randomized, controlled trial is necessary comparing steroids, surgery and observation before definitive management can be evolved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{construct}} a nomogram based on preoperative variables to better predict {{the likelihood of}} complications occurring within 30 days of radical nephroureterectomy (RNU). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of 731 patients undergoing RNU at eight academic medical centres between 2002 and 2014 were reviewed. Preoperative clinical, demographic and comorbidity indices were collected. Complications occurring within 30 days of surgery were graded using the modified Clavien-Dindo scale. Multivariate logistic regression determined the association between preoperative variables and post-RNU complications. A nomogram was created from the reduced multivariate model with internal validation using the bootstrapping technique with 200 repetitions. RESULTS: A total of 408 men and 323 women with a median age of 70 years and a body mass index of 27 kg/m(2) were included. A total of 75 % of the cohort was white, 18 % had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥ 2, 20 % had a Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score > 5 and 50 % had baseline chronic kidney disease (CKD) ≥ stage III. Overall, 279 patients (38 %) experienced a complication, including 61 events (22 %) with Clavien grade ≥ III. A multivariate model identified five variables associated with complications, including patient age, race, ECOG performance status, CKD stage and CCI score. A preoperative nomogram incorporating these risk factors was constructed with an area under curve of 72. 2 %. CONCLUSIONS: Using standard preoperative variables from this multi-institutional RNU experience, we constructed and validated a nomogram for predicting peri-operative complications after RNU. Such information may permit more accurate risk stratification on an <b>individual</b> <b>cases</b> <b>basis</b> before major surgery...|$|R

Experiments which by their nature could result in domestic or foreign allegations {{that they might have}} such effects will be included in this category even though the sponsoring agency feels confident that such allegations would in fact prove to be unfounded.1. The head of any agency that proposes to undertake a large-scale scientific or technological experiment that might have significant or protracted effects on the physical or biological environment will call such proposals {{to the attention of the}} Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. Notification of such experiments will be given sufficiently in advance that they may be modified, postponed, or cancelled, if such action is judged necessary in the national interest.2. In support of proposals for such experiments, the sponsoring agency will prepare for the Special Assistant for Science and Technology a detailed evaluation of the importance of the particular experiment and the possible direct or indirect effects that might be associated with it.3. The Special Assistant for Science and Technology will review the proposals and supporting materials presented by the sponsoring agency in order to assure that the need for the experiment has been properly weighed against possible adverse environmental effects.4. On the basis of this review, the Special Assistant for Science and Technology will recommend to me what action should be taken on the proposed experiment. If the Special Assistant judges that inadequate information is available on which to make a judgment, he may request that additional studies be undertaken by the sponsoring agency or he may undertake an independent study of the problem.5. Any experiment that may involve significant or protracted adverse effects will not be conducted without my prior approval.6. In the case of experiments (such as atmospheric nuclear tests) that have major national security implications, the head of the sponsoring agency will notify the Special Assistant for National Security Affairs as well as the Special Assistant for Science and Technology and will supply both with an evaluation of the importance of the particular experiment and the possible direct or indirect effects that might be associated with it. The Special Assistant for National Security Affairs will determine on an <b>individual</b> <b>case</b> <b>basis</b> the procedure to be followed in reviewing these experiments in order to assure that the need for the experiment has been properly weighed against possible adverse environmental effects.7. To the extent that it is consistent with national security and subsequent to approval, there should be early and widespread dissemination of public information explaining experiments of this type.8. While the final decision to conduct such experiments must continue to reside with the government, the National Academy of Sciences and where appropriate international scientific bodies or intergovernmental organizations may be consulted in the case of those experiments that might have adverse environmental effects beyond the U.S. Recommendation on the advisability of this course of action will be made by the Special Assistant for Science and Technology in consultation with the sponsoring agency and the State Department.John F.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{describe}} the extracontractual referrals of {{residents of a}} health authority during a six month period in 1994, identifying the number and cost of emergency and non-emergency referrals, including {{the number of cases}} costing more than 20, 000 pounds and those cases when payment was refused. DESIGN [...] Descriptive analysis of all extracontractual referrals submitted to the health authority between 1 April and 30 September 1994. SETTING [...] A health authority covering a population of 614, 000. RESULTS [...] Payment of 2, 583, 693 pounds was made to 263 different providers for 2400 episodes of care, of which 1469 were emergencies and 931 were elective or tertiary referrals. Authorisation was granted for an additional 1376 referrals for future treatment but was refused in 713 instances, mostly for technical reasons. Sixteen extracontractual referrals together accounted for over a fifth of total expenditure during the study period. CONCLUSIONS [...] Handling large numbers of episodes of care on an <b>individual</b> cost per <b>case</b> <b>basis</b> imposes an enormous administrative burden on both purchasers and providers, diverting money away from patient care. Extracontractual referrals also expose health authorities to considerable financial risk and may undermine commissioning strategies.

[...] "Whites" [...] are legally protected by hate crimes laws both within the laws themselves, and within the constitution's requirement they receive equal protection of the laws. Therefore, it's a moot point to determine if racism is a factor in the case of [...] "black" [...] on [...] "white" [...] crime for prosecution, since racism alone is not the only factor needed for prosecution. What is relevant to determine prosecution for a hate crime is whether any race or some other [...] "protected characteristic" [...] not [...] "protected groups" [...] was a factor in why a person targeted that/those individual/s to be their victim. e.g. If a [...] "black" [...] person targets a [...] "white" [...] person to be their victim simply because of his/her race or perceived race, whatever their accompanying rationale, they would be subject to hate crime prosecution. However, it's not without merit to determine their rationale, because it's within their rationale that one may verify if a true hate crime has been committed. This is why hate crimes are difficult to prosecute, because they essentially involve prosecuting thoughts rather than physical crimes, which are easier to prove. Therefore, this individual approach has been preferred over a blanket broad brush approach of past perceived ancestral sufferings and feelings of inferiority and/or superiority of groups that encompass thousands of individuals over hundreds of years.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: When anticoagulation is {{contraindicated}} or ineffective, optional vena cava filters {{can be used}} {{to prevent}} pulmonary embolism. These devices can be removed within a defined period of time or can remain in the vena cava permanently. METHODS: The status of optional vena cava filters was studied by a review of the relevant literature found in a selective Medline search from 2000 to 2008, including a Cochrane review and published guidelines. RESULTS: Optional vena cava filter can be removed up to 20 weeks or even longer after insertion (depending on the filter model) in a small interventional radiological procedure if therapeutic anticoagulation has been achieved or the patient is no longer at risk for venous thromboembolism. Current studies show comparable results for optional filters and permanent filters, but there have not yet been any prospective studies comparing the two filter types. CONCLUSIONS: Optional vena cava filters are an important addition to the management of venous thromboembolic disease.

This study investigated whether spectacle-mounted Chromagen lenses would enhance colour perception in individuals with abnormal colour vision. Methods: The Ishihara colour {{test was used to}} test for colour vision deficiency (CVD) and also to evaluate the effect of the Chromagen spectacle lens on colour perception in 13 subjects. An Oculus Anomaloscope was used to confirm and sub-classify the types of CVD. Subjects comprised of school age children from the Riyadh area in Saudi Arabia.

The test compounds were DNA rabies vaccine {DRV (100 mu g) } and combination rabies vaccine (CRV (100 mu g DRV and 1 / 50 dose of cell culture vaccine)), intended for clinical use by intramuscular route on 1, 7, 14 and 28 day. As per the regular mandatory requirements, the study has been designed to undertake acute (single dose- 10 days), sub-chronic (repeat dose- 28 days) and chronic (intended clinical dose- 120 days) toxicity tests using three dose levels viz. therapeutic, average (2 x therapeutic dose) and highest dose (10 x therapeutic dose) exposure in Swiss Albino mice. The selection of the rodent model viz. Swiss Albino mice is based on affinity and rapid higher antibody response during the efficacy studies. Apart from physical, physiological, clinical, hematological and histopathology profiles of all target organs, the tier-I immunotoxicity parameters have also been monitored. There were no observational adverse effects even at levels of 10 x therapeutic dose administration of DRV and CRV.

50|$|After {{experiencing}} a rotator cuff tear, {{minimally invasive surgery}} is {{needed in order to}} repair the torn tendon. After surgery, the rehabilitation of the rotator cuff is necessary in order to regain maximum strength and range of motion within the shoulder joint. Physical therapy progresses through four stages, increasing movement throughout each phase. The tempo and intensity of the stages are solely reliant on the extent of the injury and the patient’s activity necessities. The first stage requires immobilization of the shoulder joint. The shoulder that is injured is placed in a sling and shoulder flexion or abduction of the arm is avoided for 4 to 6 weeks after surgery (Brewster, 1993). Avoiding movement of the shoulder joint allows the torn tendon to fully heal. Once the tendon is entirely recovered, passive exercises can be implemented. Passive exercises of the shoulder are movements in which a physical therapist maintains the arm in a particular position, manipulating the rotator cuff without any effort by the patient. These exercises are used to increase stability, strength and range of motion of the Subscapularis, Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, and Teres minor muscles within the rotator cuff. Passive exercises include internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, as well as flexion and extension of the shoulder.As progression increases after 4-6 weeks, active exercises are now implemented into the rehabilitation process. Active exercises allow an increase in strength and further range of motion by permitting the movement of the shoulder joint without the support of a physical therapist. Active exercises include the Pendulum exercise (as shown in Image 2), which is used to strengthen the Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, and Subscapularis. External rotation of the shoulder with the arm at a 90-degree angle is an additional exercise done to increase control and range of motion of the Infraspinatus and Teres minor muscles. Various active exercises are done for an additional 3-6 weeks as progress is based on an <b>individual</b> <b>case</b> by <b>case</b> <b>basis.</b> At 8-12 weeks, strength training intensity will increase as free-weights and resistance bands will be implemented within the exercise prescription.|$|R
