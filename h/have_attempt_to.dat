30|$|As current {{publications}} have {{address the}} toxicity issue of lead [23, 44, 45, 46, 47], {{increasing number of}} researchers <b>have</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> find suitable replacement of lead in PSC [48, 49, 50]. Most notably, Sn-based perovskite had been viewed as the most suitable replacement due to its similar chemical nature to Pb as group 14 metal. Nevertheless, the stability issues of Sn with self-doping had limits the development of Sn-based perovskite [51]. This issue can potentially be managed by adding SnF 2 as inhibitor towards the formation of Sn 4 + [51]. Additionally, encapsulation also improves the overall device stability which had been proven {{to be able to}} maintain 98 % of its power conversion efficiency over 100  days. Thus, there are huge potential for the development of other materials as replacement for the highly toxic lead to produce lead-free perovskite solar cells with high-efficiency.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The main {{objectives}} of the treatment plant are reducing pollutant substances and reusing them for various applications. Due to amount of inlet sewage, one can say that whatever volume of inlet sewage increases, the accuracy of calculations and designing rises and operation of it is done in best possible way. Hydraulic designing of each system has many advantages with minimum need to pumping systems and based on using natural slope of land and gravity motion of flow. The aim of providing hydraulic flow in wastewater treatment plants is evaluating speed, capacity and eventually height drops per unit and determining hydraulic profile of the sewage surface. The wastewater treatment plant of Urmia city is designed with Biolac system. This process is under monopoly of German companies. The initial and secondary sedimentation systems are designed seamlessly and rectangular which is separated by a polyethylene separator baffles each other. In this study we <b>have</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> reform the system of initial sedimentation and compare results with Biolac system...|$|E

40|$|Separation of {{concerns}} {{is at the}} heart of software development, and although its benefits have been well established, the core problem remains how to achieve it. For complex software sys-tems the solution is still debatable and it is a major research area. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) works well only if the problem at hand can be described with relatively simple interface among objects. Unfortunately, this is not the case when we move from sequential programming to concurrent and distributed programming. The September 1993 CACM issue was devoted to the problematic marriage between OOP and Concurrency [Cohen 93]. Since then, numerous work-shops, articles and books <b>have</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> tackle the problem. The core complexity is that concur-rent and distributed systems manifest over more than one dimension. Features such as scheduling, synchronization, fault tolerance, security, testing and verifications are all expressed in such a way that they tend to cut across different objects. Hence, simple object interfaces are violated and the traditional OOP benefits no longer hold. One of the current attempts to resolve this issue is the Aspect Oriented Software Architecture. To address this multi-dimensional structure of concurrent systems we distinguish between components and aspects. Aspects are defined as properties of...|$|E
40|$|Water is {{the primary}} medium through which climate change impacts the earth's {{ecosystem}} and people. Climate change is the fundamental driver {{of change in the}} world's water resources and adds additional stress through its effects on other externalities. The UN suggests that each person needs 20 - 50 liters of water a day to ensure their basic needs for drinking, cooking and cleaning. The world uses fresh water about 70 percent for irrigation, about 22 percent for industry and about 8 percent for domestic use. Another general perception of water quality is that of a simple property that tells whether water is polluted or not. In fact, water quality is a complex subject, in part because water is a complex medium intrinsically tied to the ecology of the Earth. Industrial and commercial activities (e. g. manufacturing, mining, construction, transport) are a major cause of water pollution as are runoff from agricultural areas, urban runoff and discharge of treated and untreated sewage. The quality of drinking-water is a powerful environmental determinant of health. Assurance of drinking-water safety is a foundation for the prevention and control of waterborne diseases.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{incidence}} of natural disasters {{as well as}} followed human beings' efforts for reestablishing life is considered as unavoidable essence of nature. Whilst, the interdisciplinary theme of post disaster recovery and reconstruction has been researched worldwide {{in order to examine}} its different aspects. And within architectural interests, evaluating the housing reconstruction programs would lead to beneficial clues through which useful lessons may be learnt in terms of reconstruction management while facing such unexpected challenges. Approach: This study aimed to present the visual results of the field work survey based on the mixed method research regarding post-Bam 2003 earthquake housing reconstruction efforts. In fact, the whole study was designed to find out the relation between the attitude of survived households toward their new built homes and the degree of their participation in housing reconstruction process. The focus was on analyzing the selected captured photographs provided to support the findings as documentation of research observations. Results: Accordingly, photographs were organized in to certain categories used as a mode of interpretation within the structure of visual research method analysis. The results indicated that despite different meanings of home to households, their active participation in new housing would accelerate the recovery process from sense of loss caused by catastrophes. Besides, hereby the visual and abstract tools and objectives used by households in order to express their feelings and attitude toward new built homes was addressed within defined method. Conclusion: The results indicated that despite various limitations causing change in local housing pattern following Bam earthquake, residents <b>have</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> express their cultural identity in some degrees as linkage to lost settings...|$|E
30|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of earthquake early warning (EEW) is to predict strong ground motion for a locality before seismic waves arrive {{on the basis of}} limited ground motion observation. Most existing EEW systems rely on rapid estimation of earthquake source parameters (origin time, latitude, longitude, depth, and magnitude) which are then fed to a ground motion prediction equation (GMPE). In these EEW systems summarized by Wenzel and Zschau (2014), two key issues are precise estimation of source parameters and the precision of the GMPE. For the first issue, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (M 9.0) showed that rapid estimation of source parameters is hampered by very large focal areas and the simultaneous occurrence of aftershocks (Hoshiba et al. 2011; Hoshiba and Ozaki 2013). Attempts {{to solve the problem of}} large focal areas have included analysis of real-time GNSS data (e.g., Colombelli et al. 2013; Grapenthin et al. 2014) and direct estimation of focal area and rupture direction directly from observed seismograms (Böse et al. 2012). Other ingenious methods have been proposed to distinguish simultaneous multiple earthquakes (e.g., Tamaribuchi et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2014). The second issue of precision of GMPEs depends strongly on the influence of site amplification (e.g., Midorikawa 2009). Because site amplification generally shows frequency dependency (e.g., Satoh and Kawase 2009), many studies <b>have</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> estimate frequency-dependent site amplification factors from observed waveforms (e.g., Phillips and Aki 1986; Kawase and Matsuo 2004; Ikeura and Kato 2011; Takemoto et al. 2012; Nakano et al. 2015). On the other hand, in many GMPEs, where the variable to be predicted is the peak ground acceleration or peak ground velocity, site amplification effects are corrected by a scalar value (e.g., Midorikawa 2009). Ground motion predictions with frequency-dependent site amplification have been made (e.g., Nozu et al. 2007; Hata et al. 2011); however, their use in real-time (EEW) system is rare.|$|E

40|$|Discovery Bay {{is one of}} nine {{sites around}} Jamaica’s coastline, soon to gain the {{legislative}} protection of Fish Sanctuary (and Scientific Reserve) status. Cumulative natural and anthropogenic impacts drove the 1980 ’s coral to algae phase shift. Discovery Bay CARICOMP data (1994 to 2007) showed an increase in coral cover from less than 5 % reported in the mid 1980 ’s to 11. 7 ± 0. 31 % (mean±SE) despite chronically high algal cover (61. 4 ± 2. 2 %) at 9 m. Coral cover has been sustained despite low urchin densities (0. 99 ± 0. 91 urchins m- 2), low juvenile coral abundance (2. 15 ± 0. 19 corals m- 2) and coral mortality from repeated bleaching events. Community metrics from the CARICOMP site were compared to an adjacent reef habitat which {{was found to have}} higher coral cover (16. 36 ± 3. 1 %), as well as higher urchin (13. 7 ± 0. 84 m- 2) and juvenile coral (9. 7 ± 1. 7 m- 2) densities. Large branching coral species were absent along the CARICOMP transects and sparse at the nearby shallow reef. Both sites continue to be heavily overfished. Local history records the use of spatially and temporally isolated management strategies which <b>have</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> rehabilitate various aspects of this area. This unique temporal data set (based on the CARICOMP Methods Manual 2000) provides a baseline for evaluating Government (in) action and is used to justify proposals for ecosystem management which could facilitate phase shift reversal in a coral dominated system. An ecosystem approach that implements several concurrent strategies within and adjacent to the Reserve could accelerate the recovery process. The long term viability and benefit of both old and new marine protected or reserve areas could be enhanced through coral gardening on artificial reef structures with a view to restoring the reefs’ three-dimensional complexity. Such actions could heoretically accelerate phase reversal to coral dominated reefs common in the area prior to the devastating impacts of the 1980 s. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58 (Suppl. 3) : 63 - 69.

40|$|The Ría of Vigo (Galicia, Spain) is an estuarine system {{modulated}} by fluctuating alongshore southward and northward winds (associated with downwelling and upwelling events respectively). This {{lead to a}} {{very productive}} ecosystem that supports an important artisanal fishery of Octopus vulgaris. Additionally, the Islas Cíes, an important spawning site for O. vulgaris, connect the Ría de Vigo with the ocean through two mouths (north and south) that determinate the inflow and outflow (depending on upwelling-downwelling events). Several researches <b>have</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> understand the ecology of O. vulgaris early stages (i. e. paralarvae) in the Ría, {{but there is still}} little knowledge about the vertical behavior of Octopus paralarvae, which may be modulated by this oceanographic variability. This work studies the distribution of the paralarvae at both mouths and inside the Ría in different upwelling and downwelling events. For this, we undertook 3 oceanographic cruises at night in early autumn in 2013 : One cruise to characterize distributions during an upwelling event, another during a downwelling event and a 24 hours cruise during a strong upwelling event to determinate day-night variation. Sampling strategy consisted on two transects intersecting the inflow and outflow at both mouths, and one transect following the water fluxes moving along the Ría. Sampling was performed with a multinet trawl gear from the bottom to the surface every 5 meters. Results show different patterns according to variation of oceanographic conditions: - Downwelling situation: Southerly winds push superficial waters (0 - 15 m) into the Ría through the southern mouth and are washed out through the northern mouth. Bottom waters leave the Ría through the southern mouth. The cruise was undertaken after a strong downwelling event during previous days, and showed that the highest abundance of paralarvae was at the southern mouth concentrated below superficial waters (10 - 25 m), rising to the surface (0 - 5 m) at the inner part of the Ría. - Upwelling situation: superficial waters (0 - 20 m) enter through the northern mouth of the Ría and are washed through the southern mouth. This water movement promotes the entrance of cold, bottom upwelled water through the southern mouth of the Ría. Under this scenario, Octopus paralarvae are concentrated at the surface (10 - 0 m), thus leaving the Ría. This difference is bigger after strong upwelling during the previous days. Abundances inside the Ría are the highest, maybe because it acts as a temporal retention area, or because cold upwelled waters might stimulate hatching inside the Ría. Day/night changes under strong upwelling conditions: paralarvae abundance in both mouths was quite similar, except that during the day they were in sub-surficial waters (10 - 5 m), while at night paralarvae were mainly found close to the surface (0 - 5 m). This vertical distribution during the day is remarkable because paralarvae may select offward surface waters...|$|E
40|$|Urban design, {{like any}} other branch of the social {{sciences}} and built-environment studies, has developed in relation with the contexts in which it has emerged. Built environments in Iran have been constructed in a different way compared to their European and American counterparts. Western urban environments and cultures are the main sources of urban design knowledge. In turn, the knowledge replicates such environments and advocates such values. Nevertheless, the differences between Iranian context and the Western one is the main reason necessitating the attempt to create vernacular knowledge for Iran. At this point after urban design being introduced, taught and researched in Iran for decades, it is significant to analyze {{the success or failure of}} vernacular theories. In this respect, this article first critically reviews the literature in order to make a framework to evaluate various urban design texts. Second it assesses the influential urban design texts that have attempted to adapt the Western knowledge to the context of Iranian cities. The assumption of this article is that vernacular theories are more capable of creating successful places and fulfilling needs and demands of the society. In this respect, criticizing and analyzing texts that aimed at making vernacular knowledge paves the way for further attempts in both theory and practice. The main references of this article are from two seemingly discrete domains. First the texts which discuss and introduce the characteristics of successful urban design theory. We assume that vernacular urban design theory is a kind of theory belonging to the broader domain of urban design thinking, it must meet the criteria of successful urban design theory. The second set of references are from texts that are particularly studying the characteristics of successful vernacular theory. Many studies, from countries that imported the knowledge, <b>have</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> clarify such characteristics under various titles. However, there is not any study on this topic in Iran. Therefore, this article offers contributions to the literature. The urban design texts that have vernacular aspects are being analyzed on the basis of three main criteria of analyzing theory and two specific criteria of analyzing vernacular theory. The main criteria of a good theory are: 1. The way of building a theory should be justifiable. Clarifying such processes would enable further revisions when required and justify the theory; 2. The theory should have practical applications; since the goal of urban design is making better places the theory within this field should ultimately have practical influences 3. A theory should learn from the past urban design experiences; Ignoring the existing body of knowledge is certainly a disadvantage for any research or theory. Two specific criteria of analyzing vernacular theory discussed in this article are that 1. The theory should respond to the specific problems of Iranian cities; meaning a so-called vernacular theory should aimed at solving vernacular problems. Inevitably such a theory, first of all, needs to have a good understanding of urban problems in Iran. The second requirement for its criterion is to have a realistic assessment of the potentials and abilities in Iran (including academic potentials) 2. The theory should consider the cultural and vernacular values and norms. This means that solutions suggested by the vernacular theories should be defined in a way to lessen the gap between culturally accepted values and the existing condition. This criterion develops the fact that urban design is always and necessarily value-laden and a good vernacular theory must represent local values. Therefore, three key urban design texts that are basically written for Iran and have been successfully received by the professionals are being examined against the mentioned criteria. These titles are achieved through a systematic review of the literature while it can be seen as representatives of successful urban design texts written by Iranian urban design scholars for the Iranian cities. The results of this article display that the Iranian theorists have paid attention to the necessity of vernacular theories as all the three writers touched upon this issue [...] The vague process of making vernacular theory, fails to take the local values into account, and the weak linkage between the available knowledge and case studies have deteriorated the effectiveness of the attempts of making vernacular urban design in Iran. This article adds that vernacularizing urban design must also be aware of similar attempts in different fields. This article makes the contribution to the literature by highlighting the importance of the topic for future research as well as offering the set of criteria for good vernacular urban design theory that can be used in order to systematically develop the knowledge. Moreover, the evaluation of the three influential texts in the final part of this article aims to find strengths and weaknesses of the existing literature.
