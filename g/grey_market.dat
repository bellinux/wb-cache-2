The keys are sold by third-party providers such as Humble Bundle (in which {{a portion of}} the sale is given back to the publisher or distributor), distributed as part of a physical release to redeem the game, or given to a user as part of promotions, often used to deliver Kickstarter and other crowd funding rewards. A <b>grey</b> <b>market</b> exists around Steam keys, where less reputable buyers purchase a large number of Steam keys for a game when it is offered for a low cost, and then resell these keys to users or other third-party sites at a higher price, generating profit for themselves. This caused some of these third-party sites, like G2A, to be embroiled in this <b>grey</b> <b>market.</b> It is possible for publishers to have Valve to track down where specific keys have been used and cancel them, removing the product from the user's libraries, leaving the user to seek any recourse with the third-party they purchased from. Other legitimate storefronts, like Humble Bundle, have set a minimum price that must be spent to obtain Steam keys as to discourage mass purchases that would enter the <b>grey</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E

Part I discusses the background of the grey goods controversy by examining the history of the controlling statutory and case law and the recent grey goods cases. Part II demonstrates that trademark owners are not significantly injured by the availability of grey goods, but actually gain windfall profits if there is an absolute bar on grey goods. Part III argues that preventing importation of grey goods injures international free trade.

In Mumbai alone, the most populous city in India of 30 million, {{more than half of}} its population lives in grey zones such as slums, with speculation that by 2025, they will pervade much of Mumbai’s urban landscape 1. Characteristic of slums are inhabitants sharing small spaces but paradoxically, such forced intimacies come with major social distance architected by caste, class, gender norms and even the color of one’s skin. In a contemporary urban culture where arranged marriages still dictate one’s social life and being ‘fair and lovely’ is a ticket to social mobility, the city can serve as a traditional and chronic entrapment...|$|R

The Nintendo 64 was first sold in North America on September 26, 1996, despite having been advertised for the 29th.

In 1994, prior to the launch, Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln emphasized the quality of first-party games, saying [...] "... we're convinced that a few great games at launch are more important than great games mixed in with a lot of dogs". The PAL version of the console was released in Europe on March 1, 1997. According to Nintendo of America representatives, Nintendo had been planning a simultaneous launch in Japan, North America, and Europe, but market studies indicated that worldwide demand for the system far exceeded the number of units they could have ready by launch, potentially leading to consumer and retailer frustration.|$|E

Next it introduces findings from engineering literature regarding the benefits and risks associated with this type of planning. Finally, it applies engineering knowledge to strategic decision-making in marketing. For example, engineering literature suggests that platform-based planning for global markets will allow firms to better balance the adaptation versus standardization decision but could lead to suboptimal designs and the emergence of <b>grey</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R
