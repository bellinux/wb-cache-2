5|$|<b>Flying</b> {{instruction}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World WarII, {{in response to a}} vast {{increase in the number of}} aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war pilot training facility, No.1 <b>Flying</b> Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, was supplanted in 1940–41 by twelve elementary <b>flying</b> training schools (EFTS) and eight service <b>flying</b> training schools (SFTS). The EFTS provided a twelve-week introductory <b>flying</b> course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF's initial training schools. <b>Flying</b> training was undertaken in two stages: the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of <b>flying)</b> to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including sixty-five hours of <b>flying)</b> at the EFTS. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{undertook}} {{his initial}} training with No.1 Elementary <b>Flying</b> Training School in Parafield, South Australia, <b>flying</b> De Havilland Tiger Moths, and with No.21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, <b>flying</b> CAC Wirraways. He was awarded his wings and commissioned {{as a pilot}} officer on 28June 1940. Following advanced training on Avro Ansons with No.1 Service <b>Flying</b> Training School at RAAF Point Cook in September, he was selected to become a flight instructor. He completed the requisite course at Central <b>Flying</b> School in Camden, New South Wales, and was promoted to <b>flying</b> officer on 28December. He subsequently began training students under the Empire Air Training Scheme at No.2 Service <b>Flying</b> Training School near Wagga Wagga, {{under the command of}} Group Captain Frederick Scherger.|$|E
5|$|No.1 Elementary <b>Flying</b> Training School {{was formed}} as No.2 <b>Flying</b> Training School in Melbourne on 6November 1939. Its inaugural {{commanding}} officer was Squadron Leader F.J.B. Wight. On 13December, the school moved to Parafield, South Australia, after building work was completed there. Parafield {{was home to}} the South Australian Aero Club, {{and it was the}} airfield's position as the hub of civilian flight instruction in the state that led to it becoming the base for the first <b>flying</b> school the RAAF raised during World WarII. The same principle was followed in establishing No.3 <b>Flying</b> Training School (later renamed No.2 Elementary <b>Flying</b> Training School) at Archerfield, Queensland, No.3 Elementary <b>Flying</b> Training School at Essendon, Victoria, and No.4 Elementary <b>Flying</b> Training School at Mascot, New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|No.2 Elementary <b>Flying</b> Training School {{was formed}} as No.3 <b>Flying</b> Training School at Archerfield, Queensland, on 6November 1939. Its inaugural {{commanding}} officer was Flight Lieutenant T.C. Curnow. Archerfield {{was home to}} private aviation clubs and schools including the Queensland Aero Club and Airwork Ltd, {{and it was the}} airfield's position as the hub of civilian flight instruction in the state that led to it becoming the base for the second <b>flying</b> school the RAAF raised during World WarII. The same principle was followed in establishing No.2 <b>Flying</b> Training School (later renamed No. 1 Elementary <b>Flying</b> Training School) at Parafield, South Australia, No.3 Elementary <b>Flying</b> Training School at Essendon, Victoria, and No. 4 Elementary <b>Flying</b> Training School at Mascot, New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|The {{course at}} SFTS {{typically}} {{consisted of two}} streams, intermediate and advanced, and included such techniques as instrument <b>flying,</b> night <b>flying,</b> advanced aerobatics, formation <b>flying,</b> dive bombing, and aerial gunnery. The total duration of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew fluctuated. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours <b>flying</b> time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours <b>flying</b> time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|The grey-headed <b>flying</b> fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) is a megabat {{native to}} Australia. The species shares {{mainland}} Australia {{with three other}} members of the genus Pteropus: the little red <b>flying</b> fox (P. scapulatus), the spectacled <b>flying</b> fox (P. conspicillatus), and the black <b>flying</b> fox (P. alecto).|$|E
5|$|A <b>flying</b> ace or fighter ace is a {{military}} aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat (The Germans traditionally set the threshold at 10 victories.). During World War II, hundreds of German Luftwaffe fighter pilots achieved this feat <b>flying</b> contemporary piston engine fighter aircraft. However, only 28 pilots are credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft while <b>flying</b> a jet-powered aircraft.|$|E
5|$|A ski <b>flying</b> event {{consists}} of several preliminary stages, {{culminating in a}} competition to decide a winner and subsequent order. Within an event there are up to three competitions – individual, and sometimes team – all taking place on separate days. These competitions are contested somewhat differently depending on whether an event is staged {{as part of the}} Ski <b>Flying</b> World Championships or Ski <b>Flying</b> World Cup. In both events, a 'training' round takes place on the opening day, as well as a 'trial' round before each competition; these non-scoring rounds are essentially practice or warm-up sessions, and athlete participation is optional.|$|E
5|$|According to Henderson, {{newspaper}} {{articles on the}} <b>Flying</b> Spaghetti Monster {{attracted the attention of}} book publishers; he said that at one point, there were six publishers interested in the <b>Flying</b> Spaghetti Monster. In November 2005, Henderson received an advance from Villard to write The Gospel of the <b>Flying</b> Spaghetti Monster.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Newkirk's {{body was}} disinterred by a joint Thai-American {{military}} team and reburied in Saint James the Less Cemetery, Scarsdale, Westchester County, New York on 11 May 1949. Newkirk {{was awarded the}} Distinguished <b>Flying</b> Cross, posthumously, in 2007, following the 1991 official recognition of the <b>Flying</b> Tigers as veterans of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere <b>flying</b> north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those <b>flying</b> south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while <b>flying</b> are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{official}} website of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats consider {{them as the}} same team, the Tiger-Cats, Hamilton Alerts, Hamilton Tigers and Hamilton <b>Flying</b> Wildcats are all listed separately because, when the latter three were active, the teams competed as separate franchises. The Tigers and <b>Flying</b> Wildcats merged in 1950 to create the Tiger-Cats.|$|E

5|$|Born in Andrews, South Carolina, Overton took {{an early}} {{interest}} in <b>flying,</b> and attended The Citadel {{for a year}} before enlisting in the United States Navy briefly during World War II. Afterward, Overton graduated from West Point and began a career <b>flying</b> the F-84 Thunderjet. In 1952, Overton volunteered to fly in the Korean War and flew 102 missions in an F-84 before transferring to the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and <b>flying</b> the F-86 Sabre. During a four-day time period in early 1953, Overton claimed five MiG-15 victories in MiG alley, certifying him as a <b>flying</b> ace. However, he was subsequently returned to the United States in shame after commanders charged him with insubordination for crossing the Yalu River into Manchuria for his victories.|$|E
5|$|Captain Michael Brezas, USAAF fighter ace, {{arrived in}} Lucera, Italy {{during the summer}} of 1944, joining the 48th Fighter Squadron of the 14th Fighter Group. <b>Flying</b> the P-38 aircraft, Lt. Brezas downed 12 enemy planes within two months. He {{received}} the Silver Star Medal, the Distinguished <b>Flying</b> Cross, and the Air Medal with eleven oak leaf clusters.|$|E
5|$|Captain Walter Lux, 53, {{had been}} <b>flying</b> the DC-10 since its {{introduction}} eight years earlier. He had logged around 22,000 <b>flying</b> hours, of which about 3,000 {{were in a}} DC-10. He was also qualified to pilot 17 other aircraft, including the DC-6, DC-7, and Boeing 727. First Officer James Dillard, 49, and Flight Engineer Alfred Udovich, 56, were also highly experienced: 9,275 hours and 15,000 hours respectively, and between them they had 1,830 hours <b>flying</b> experience in the DC-10.|$|E
5|$|Club <b>flying</b> {{started in}} November 1927 with the East Kent <b>Flying</b> Club and {{although}} membership reached 220 by 1931 {{the club was}} struggling financially. On 1 January 1932 it became part of Brooklands Aviation and was renamed as the Cinque Ports <b>Flying</b> Club. Lympne was visited by many aviation personalities. Ken Waller learnt to fly at Lympne and became a long-distance and race pilot. W. E. Davis was the secretary/manager of Cinque Ports <b>Flying</b> Club from 1932 {{until his death in}} 1938. His wife Ann took over the position in the 18 {{months leading up to the}} Second World War. On 22 May 1937 the Duke and Duchess of Kent visited Lympne in an Airspeed Envoy (G-AEXX) of the King's Flight while visiting Shorncliffe Barracks. From 1938 the club participated in the Civil Air Guard training programme, giving subsidised <b>flying</b> lessons. The Currie Wot was designed and built at Lympne. The Cinque Ports <b>Flying</b> Club restarted after the war but folded on 1 October 1948.|$|E

5|$|Dolphin D. Overton {{was born}} on 2 April 1926 in Andrews, South Carolina. He was {{interested}} in <b>flying</b> from an early age, and as a boy he flew with his father. He became an avid reader of stories from World War I <b>flying</b> aces. At age 16, Overton was <b>flying</b> solo in a Piper J-3 Cub.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Jones saw {{action as}} an infantryman in the Gallipoli Campaign of 1915, before {{transferring}} to the Australian <b>Flying</b> Corps a year later. Originally a mechanic, he undertook <b>flying</b> training in 1917 and was posted to a fighter squadron in France. He achieved seven victories {{to become an}} ace, and was awarded the Distinguished <b>Flying</b> Cross. After a short spell in civilian life following World WarI, he joined the newly formed RAAF in 1921, and rose steadily through training and personnel commands prior to World WarII.|$|E

5|$|Eaton was {{commissioned}} {{as a pilot}} officer upon graduation from <b>flying</b> school in January 1937, and posted to No.1 Squadron. Within six months {{he was promoted to}} <b>flying</b> officer and joined No.21 Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton. In 1938, he became an instructor at Point Cook's No.1 <b>Flying</b> Training School, where he also took part in the RAAF's early long navigation exercises. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1September 1939.|$|E
5|$|Events {{under the}} Ski <b>Flying</b> World Cup have several {{differences}} to the Ski <b>Flying</b> World Championships. The latter is an isolated tournament, or one-off event, {{in the same}} vein as the Ski Jumping World Championships and Winter Olympics, whereas the Ski <b>Flying</b> World Cup is part of the overall Ski Jumping World Cup season, and uses the same points system. These points contribute towards both Ski <b>Flying</b> and Ski Jumping World Cup standings; the former being effectively a 'mini season' within the latter. However, a feature shared with the Ski <b>Flying</b> World Championships is that the starting order switches over from the Ski Jumping World Cup standings to the Ski <b>Flying</b> World Cup standings after the first competition of the latter, and remains that way for all subsequent events.|$|E
5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent <b>flying</b> through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are <b>flying</b> overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's <b>flying</b> machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz <b>flying</b> off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E

5|$|Finucane was {{now one of}} the 45 {{pilots in}} his class to have {{completed}} 100 hours of piloting time on aircraft since he joined the RAF. After completing basic flight training on 28 October 1938, Finucane was classed as an average pilot, but deemed to be competent enough to be assigned to advanced <b>flying</b> school. With effect from the following day, he was granted a short-service commission as an acting pilot officer (on probation) and sent to 8 <b>Flying</b> Training School, RAF Montrose in Scotland. On 12 November, he left King's Cross railway station travelling on the <b>Flying</b> Scotsman to Glasgow, arriving at Montrose after a 10-hour journey.|$|E
