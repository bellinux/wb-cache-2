Nevertheless, Mengsk rebuilds and the Dominion remains the dominant Terran power. In Frontline, many of the stories in the anthology paint Mengsk and the Dominion overall as tyrannical and corrupt, no different from the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Robinson {{argues that}} the {{popularity}} of Musidora reflects a change in art buyers.

These new buyers lacked the classical education to understand the references in history paintings, but could appreciate Musidora as a skilful <b>execution</b> <b>and</b> as a work of beauty in its own right.|$|E

When Waltheof rebelled against William the Conqueror, however, the act led to his <b>execution</b> <b>and</b> to his subsequent veneration as a saint at Crowland Abbey. Waltheof's daughter married David I, King of the Scots, and through this connection Siward became one of the many ancestors of the later Scottish and British monarchs.|$|E

If captured, resistance members risked torture and <b>execution,</b> <b>and</b> around 17,000 were killed during the occupation.|$|E

The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the <b>execution</b> <b>and</b> exile of many communards to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.|$|E
5|$|The {{prints were}} {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London.

Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.|$|E

5|$|Following Temple's marriage, {{his father}} had {{invested}} in a farming venture by Edward Whalley who was the brother-in-law of Temple's stepsister - Mary Penistone. Sir Alexander apparently intended this to provide an inheritance for his grandchildren (the children of James Temple). As a younger son himself, Sir Alexander wanted to ensure suitable provision for his own younger son. This investment made by Temple's father {{for the benefit of}} his children had apparently become valueless when Edward Whalley fled to Scotland in the late 1630s. However, in the 1650s, Whalley had become a prominent and successful member of the Puritan establishment and there was a possibility of recovering some money. In the late 1650s, Temple and Whalley went to the Court of Chancery to determine what was due to Temple and his children. However, with the death of Oliver Cromwell and the subsequent restoration of Charles II, both regicides were faced with the possibility of <b>execution</b> <b>and</b> the case appears to have been unresolved.|$|E
