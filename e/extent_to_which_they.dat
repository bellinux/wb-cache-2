According to Maurice Rives, 10,000 Vietnamese troops were given transfers to different zones.

One possible rationale for this measure was to break up any undiscovered VNQDĐ cells and to sever personal ties, within units and between soldiers and civilians in their local district. The mass transfer of soldiers also had the effect of creating a state of constant mobilisation, denying troops the time and opportunity for anti-colonial organisation.|$|E

5|$|Raskolnikov's dreams have a {{symbolic}} meaning, which suggests a psychological view. The {{dream of the}} mare being whipped has been suggested as the fullest single expression of the whole novel, symbolizing gratification and punishment, contemptible motives and contemptible society, depicting the nihilistic destruction of an unfit mare, the gratification therein, and Rodion's disgust and horror, {{as an example of}} his conflicted character. Raskolnikov's disgust and horror is central to the theme of his conflicted character, his guilty conscience, his contempt for society, his rationality of himself as an extraordinary man above greater society, holding authority to kill, and his concept of justified murder. His reaction is pivotal, provoking his first taking of life toward the rationalization of himself as above greater society. The dream is later mentioned when Raskolnikov talks to Marmeladov. Marmeladov's daughter, morally chaste and devout Sonya, must earn a living as a prostitute for their impoverished family, the result of his alcoholism. The dream is also a warning, foreshadowing an impending murder and holds several comparisons to his murder of the pawnbroker. The dream occurs after Rodion crosses a bridge leading out of the oppressive heat and dust of Petersburg and into the fresh greenness of the islands. This symbolizes a corresponding mental crossing, suggesting that Raskolnikov is returning to a state of clarity when he has the dream. In it, he returns to the innocence of his childhood and watches as a group of peasants beat an old mare to death. After Raskolnikov awakes, he reflects on it as a “such a hideous dream,” the same term he earlier used to describe his plot to kill the old woman (62). This diction draws a parallel between the two, suggesting that the child represents the part of him that clings to morality and watches horrified as another facet, represented by the peasants, is driven by hardship and isolation to become cold and unfeeling. The constant laughing of the peasants in the face of brutal slaughter reveals the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> have been desensitized by their suffering, which is a reflection of Raskolnikov’s own condition. This interpretation is further supported by fact that the main peasant, Mikolka, feels that he has the right to kill the horse, linking his actions to Raskolnikov’s theory justifying murder for a select group of extraordinary men. The comparison between the cruel slaughter of the old mare and the plan to murder Alyona Ivanovna delineates the brutality of Raskolnikov’s crime, which is often downplayed by his habitual dehumanizing referral to the old woman as simply a “louse.” While awake, Raskolnikov’s view of the old woman is spiteful, defined by his tenacious belief in his extraordinary man theory. However, the dream acts as a conduit for Raskolnikov’s subconscious, and without the constraints of his theory the horrific nature of his crime becomes apparent. Therefore, in order for Raskolnikov to find redemption, he must ultimately renounce his theory.|$|E

Indicator species analysis finds both dominant and non-dominant species that have high specificity and fidelity to a given class using a permutation test to assign an indicator value and associated p-value to those species (Dufrene and Legendre 1997) and any set of alternative classifications can be compared based on those metrics (Dufrene and Legendre 1997). Classifications ranked highly by indicator species analysis will have at least one significant indicator species associated with each class, higher total numbers of indicator species overall, larger sums of all significant indicator values, and lower p-values on average. We used those metrics in our comparison of {{the classification}}s here. We standardized all indicator species metrics that were based on sums or counts by dividing by the number of classes in each classification.|$|R

In this study, we analyzed six chitin-binding lectins, DSA, LEL, PWM, STL, UDA, and WGA, by quantitative frontal affinity chromatography. Some novel features were evident: WGA showed almost comparable affinity for pyridylaminated chitotriose and chitotetraose, while LEL and UDA showed much weaker affinity, and DSA, PWM, and STL had no substantial affinity for the former. WGA showed selective affinity for hybrid-type N-glycans harboring a bisecting GlcNAc residue. UDA showed extensive binding to high-mannose type N-glycans, with affinity increasing with the number of Man residues. DSA showed the highest affinity for highly branched N-glycans consisting of type II LacNAc (N-acetyllactosamine). Further, multivalent features of these lectins were investigated by using glycoconjugate and lectin microarrays. The lectins showed substantial binding to immobilized LacNAc as well as chito-oligosaccharides, although the <b>extents</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> bound varied among them.

60|$|Such, then, are {{the points}} of analogy and {{the points of}} {{difference}}. May we not say that the points of difference serve but to bring into clearer light the points of analogy? While comparison makes definite the obvious contrasts between organisms commonly so called, and the social organism, it shows that even these contrasts are not so decided as was to be expected.

These are traits that societies have in common with organic bodies. And these traits in <b>which</b> <b>they</b> agree with organic bodies and disagree with all other things, entirely subordinate the minor distinctions: such distinctions being scarcely greater than those which separate one half of the organic kingdom from the other.

40|$|Background: Sorsby’s fundus {{dystrophy}} (SFD) {{is caused}} by mutations in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) - 3 and, {{with the exception of}} early onset, is similar to age-related macular degeneration. The pathological features of this condition relate to the accumulation of TIMP- 3 in Bruch’s membrane. Aims: To compare the extracellular membrane-binding characteristics of wild-type and four SFD-mutant TIMP- 3 s. Methods: COS- 7 cells were transfected with wild-type, Ser- 181, Gly- 167, Ser- 156 and Tyr- 168 SFD-mutant TIMP- 3 cDNA. The TIMP- 3 proteins subsequently synthesised were harvested, analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, semiquantified by ELISA and used in binding assays {{on the basis of the}} retention of the wild-type and SFD-mutant TIMP- 3 proteins by components of Bruch’s membrane. Results: SFD-mutant TIMP- 3 s could not be distinguished from wild-type TIMP- 3 by the <b>extents</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> aggregated or adhered to type-I collagen, type-IV collagen, fibronectin, laminin, elastin, chondroitin sulphates A, B and C, and heparin sulphate.

However, identical patterns of precipitin curves accompany very different sequences in CDR 3. Antibodies of group 1, which react only with class II dextrans, differ the most in primary sequence, a finding suggesting that subsites responsible for cross reactivity with class I dextrans may be blocked and that this may be effected by side chains of different amino acids.

40|$|What {{should an}} {{adequate}} representation of individuals (elements of {{the domain of}} discourse) be like, within vagueness models with degrees? This paper explores the hypothesis that individuals are distinguished by their property values, i. e. the <b>extents</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> satisfy gradable properties. First, as Lewis (1986) argues, cross-world identity is intuitively implausible between individuals differing in their property values, e. g., their height, weight, etc. ('intrinsic properties'). However, cross-world identity is intuitively plausible between individuals sharing the same property values (the same heights, weights, etc.), even if they differ along extrinsic, relational properties, e. g., if they are considered 'tall' in one world, but not in another, due to variance in the cutoff point of tall across the two worlds. A representation of individuals by their property values captures the intuitively sharp distinction between these two cases. Second, this proposal captures the intuitive difference between cases we tend to call 'ignorance' and cases we tend to call 'vagueness' (for Williamson 1994, cases of 'accidental' versus cases of 'inherent' ignorance), which are usually modeled with the same formal means. While vagueness/inherent ignorance (about the truth value of statements like Dan is tall) arises due to partial information regarding cutoff points of vague predicates like tall, accidental ignorance (say, about the truth value of statements like Dan is two meters tall or Dan is taller than Sam) arises due to partial information regarding property values (e. g., the height) of referents of arguments like Dan ('discourse entities'). A representation of individuals by their property values, then, captures the intuitive distinctions between both phenomena...|$|R
40|$|The {{functions}} of social learning concern {{the acquisition of}} skills and information that enable individuals to adjust competently to their environments. However, individuals differ in the <b>extents</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> cope with, maintain and create social and other environmental opportunities. Hence, it is relevant to consider dispositions of individuals interactively - as with emotion, attention and activity; to emphasise self regulatory behaviour, as with selective attention towards or away from environmental conditions. These propensities facilitate positive and negative responses {{that are associated with}} the uptake and use of skill and information from other individuals. In these regards, the study of temperament has fertile but mainly unexplored potential. Examples are given from studies of simian primates in which differences in temperament have predictive implications for social learning. When relatively fearful animals confront challenging situations, they are likely to avoid them and become physiologically disturbed. Less fearful and active animals interact more, and in emotionally more positive ways with other individuals. They are more likely to maintain closer physical proximity to others, to attend more to what they are doing and where. Hence, they have greater chances of facilitating advantageous responses - as in feeding strategies. In the acquisition of social skills, less fearful animals engage in play activities more than relatively fearful animals. Such interactions facilitate the development of information about other individuals, and the quality of social behaviour that is developed. These examples show the value of an integrative approach to behavioural studies - in which behaviour is considered with other biological systems...|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to gain a deeper {{understanding}} and extended knowledge about the multilingualism and language use of teenagers with Swedish backgrounds who live abroad and participate in Swedish instruction. This thesis is based on four empirical studies comprised {{of a total of}} 143 high school students. Three of the studies are based on data from a questionnaire and analyzed by means of descriptive and inferential statistics. The fourth study is based on a three-fold set of data, including self-recordings, interviews, and a questionnaire, that was analyzed by using nexus analysis. The results indicate that the multilingualism and language use of the participants are dynamic and complex. Although social domains (e. g. home, school, and social life with friends and peers) appear {{to have an impact on}} the participants’ language use, there is heterogeneity in the patterns of language use. These results are discussed in the light of domain theory and the dynamic perspective on multilingualism. According to the results, the language of instruction plays a vital role in their participants’ multilingualism regardless of whether it is a L 1, L 2 or foreign language. It is argued in the thesis that the conception of these linguistic terms becomes challenged by the language use in the international globalized society. The main principles of language choice among the participants in the fourth study are those of inclusion and, what I metaphorically define as, ‘the least common denominator’. The principles of language choice are discussed in the light of the multilingual educational environment that these teenagers are a part of. Methodologically, the fourth study illustrates the importance of triangulating data. The results show a discrepancy between the participants’ reported language use and the face-to-face interaction in the self-recordings.

Using equilibrium competition binding with [(3) H](1, 4, 5) IP(3) in Ca(2 +) -free cytosol-like medium, the relative affinities of the receptor subtypes for (1, 4, 5) IP(3) were type 3 (K(d) = 11 +/- 2 nM) >type 2 (K(d) = 17 +/- 2 nM) >type 1 (K(d) = 24 +/- 4 nM). (1, 4, 5) IP(3) binding was reversibly stimulated by increased pH, but the subtypes differed in their sensitivity to pH (type 1 >type 2 >type 3). For all three subtypes, the equatorial 6 -hydroxy group of (1, 4, 5) IP(3) was essential for high-affinity binding, the equatorial 3 -hydroxy group significantly improved affinity, and the axial 2 -hydroxy group was insignificant; a 1 -phosphate (or in its absence, a 2 -phosphate) improved binding affinity. The subtypes differed in the <b>extents</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> tolerated inversion of the 3 -hydroxy group of (1, 4, 5) IP(3) (type 1 >type 2 >type 3), and this probably accounts for the selectivity of (1, 4, 6) IP(3) for type 1 receptors. They also differed in their tolerance of inversion, removal or substitution (by phosphate) of the 2 -hydroxy group (types 2 and 3 >type 1), hence the selectivity of (1, 2, 4, 5) IP(4) for type 2 and 3 receptors. Removal of the 3 -hydroxy group or its replacement by fluorine or CH(2) OH was best tolerated by type 3 receptors, and accounts for the selectivity of 3 -deoxy(1, 4, 5) IP(3) for type 3 receptors.

The U. S. approach stands for a highly regulated, and partly bureaucratic, approach where the ethics review is modeled on the methodology of natural sciences. In the UK, in contrast, a social science research ethics framework has been developed that remedies some of these shortcomings. It is implemented through pressure from funding institutions and aims to respond to the needs of social science research. The German social science ethics framework consists of non-binding codes of conduct, guidelines about good scientific practice, and ethic codes of the German professional associations and funding institutions. We find that ethical behavior in Germany is most typically understood as ethical behavior towards the peers. We recommend the establishment of a new research ethics framework for the social sciences in Germany modeled on the UK's. " [author's abstract...|$|R
