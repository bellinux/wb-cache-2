40|$|Full duplex (FD) {{communications}} has {{the potential}} to double the capacity of a half duplex (HD) system at the link level. However, in a cellular network, FD operation is not a straightforward extension of half <b>duplex</b> <b>operations.</b> The increased interference due to a large number of simultaneous transmissions in FD operation and realtime traffic conditions limits the capacity improvement. Realizing the potential of FD requires careful coordination of resource allocation among the cells as well as within the cell. In this paper, we propose a distributed resource allocation, i. e., joint user selection and power allocation for a FD multi-cell system, assuming FD base stations (BSs) and HD user equipment (UEs). Due to the complexity of finding the globally optimum solution, a sub-optimal solution for UE selection, and a novel geometric programming based solution for power allocation, are proposed. The proposed distributed approach converges quickly and performs almost as well as a centralized solution, but with much lower signaling overhead. It provides a hybrid scheduling policy which allows FD operations whenever it is advantageous, but otherwise defaults to HD operation. We focus on small cell systems because they are more suitable for FD operation, given practical self-interference cancellation limits. With practical self-interference cancellation, it is shown that the proposed hybrid FD system achieves nearly two times throughput improvement for an indoor multi-cell scenario, and about 65 % improvement for an outdoor multi-cell scenario compared to the HD system.

We propose a blind algorithm to estimate the effective channel gain at each user, that does not require any downlink pilots. We derive a capacity lower bound of each user for our proposed scheme, applicable to any propagation channel. Compared to the case of no downlink pilots (relying on channel hardening), and compared to training-based estimation using downlink pilots, our blind algorithm performs significantly better.

In this paper, a throughput maximization problem for energy harvesting two-hop networks with decode-and-forward half-duplex relays is investigated.

Optimal transmission policies for one and two parallel relays are studied under the assumption of non-causal knowledge of energy arrivals and finite size relay data buffers. The problem is formulated using a convex optimization framework, which allows for efficient numerical solutions and helps identify important properties of optimal policies. Numerical results are presented to provide throughput comparisons and to investigate the impact of multiple relays, size of relay data buffers, transmission modes, and energy harvesting on the throughput.
