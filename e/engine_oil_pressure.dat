2500|$|A new [...] "E-stick" [...] option {{combined}} {{a manual}} 3-speed transmission {{with an automatic}} clutch as a low-cost alternative to the fully automatic transmission. The E-stick was also available in conjunction with an overdrive unit. The system cost $59.50, but offered stick-shift economy, performance, and driver control without a clutch pedal by using <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> and intake manifold vacuum to engage and disengage the clutch when shifting gears.|$|E
2500|$|During 1991, a 1.8L 16-valve engine {{producing}} [...] (also {{first seen}} in the Renault 19) capable of propelling the car to [...] {{was introduced to the}} Clio engine range, known simply as the Clio 16S in France (S for [...] "soupapes", the French word for valves), and Clio 16V in export markets. It was the successor to the Renault 5 GT Turbo, which was discontinued that year as the R5 range was pruned back. As well as having a higher top speed than a regular Clio, the 16S sports wider plastic front wings, an offset bonnet vent, wider rear arches and uprated suspension and brakes, and colour-coded front mirrors and bumpers. The RSi side skirts were omitted, however. Inside, the 16V model has an extended instrument panel that houses dials for <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> oil temperature, and oil level (which only indicates on engine start). The seats are also more supportive to match the sporting nature of the model. The non-catalyzed versions, still available in some markets, offer [...] and marginally higher performance with top speeds up to [...] and the 0â€“100km/h time dropping from 8 to 7.8seconds.|$|E
50|$|US patent US5375570 A of 1994 {{describes}} an automated compression release valve actuated by <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
50|$|Propeller Control - Used to set {{the desired}} {{propeller}} speed. Once the pilot has set the desired propeller speed, the propeller governor maintains that propeller speed by adjusting the {{pitch of the propeller}} blades, using the <b>engine's</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> to move a hydraulic piston in the propeller hub.|$|R
50|$|Some vehicle <b>engines</b> have an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> {{switch that}} {{switches}} a warning light on at low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> Some vehicles have an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> gauge in the dashboard or instrument cluster.|$|R
50|$|The {{oil pump}} in an {{internal}} combustion <b>engine</b> circulates <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> under <b>pressure</b> to the rotating bearings, the sliding pistons and the camshaft of the engine. This lubricates the bearings, allows {{the use of}} higher-capacity fluid bearings and also assists in cooling the engine.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, CAT {{introduced}} [...] "hydraulically actuated {{electronic unit}} injection" [...] (HEUI), where the injectors {{are no longer}} camshaft-operated. First available on Navistar's 7.3L /444 cubic-inch, V8 diesel engine, and later in Navistar DT466E, HEUI used <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> to power high-pressure fuel injection, {{in contrast to the}} traditional method of unit-injector operation via the engine camshaft.|$|E
5000|$|Despite being {{mechanically}} {{similar to}} the Aries and Reliant, its fascias closely resembled those of the larger E-body sedans. This generation featured Chrysler's Electronic Voice Alert, a computerized voice which warned drivers about various conditions with phrases such as [...] "Your door is ajar" [...] or [...] "Your <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is low".The LeBaron was facelifted for 1986 receiving rounder front and rear ends to improve aerodynamics.|$|E

5000|$|Many pilots {{suffered}} stomach cramps, or {{found themselves}} unable to eat. As combat wore on, {{the number of}} aircraft turning back to France owing to overheating <b>engines,</b> low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> or instrument failure steadily increased. Pilots suffered mysterious bouts of appendicitis, or found other means {{to make their way}} to the sick bay.|$|R
5000|$|Some older {{vehicles}} had {{a single}} indicator labeled [...] "trouble" [...] or [...] "engine"; {{this was not a}} MIL, but an [...] "idiot light" [...] meant to indicate serious trouble with the <b>engine</b> (low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> overheating, or charging system problems) and an imminent breakdown. This usage of the [...] "engine" [...] light was discontinued in the mid-1980s, to prevent confusion with the MIL.|$|R
50|$|During the {{stopover}} at Boise, Idaho, Edgar's pilot friend, Jerry Stiller (Scott Wilson) {{changes the}} <b>oil</b> in the <b>engine,</b> but neglects to tighten a hose. The tension between Edgar and Tillie continues to escalate, {{and when the}} flight resumes, Edgar decides to take a shortcut over the mountains, deviating from the normal route. However, the <b>engine</b> loses <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> and soon fails, causing Edgar to crash land on a remote ridge.|$|R
5000|$|VVT-i, {{introduced}} on the 1JZ-GTE/2JZ-GTE {{engine in}} 1996, varies {{the timing of}} the intake valves by adjusting the relationship between the camshaft drive (belt or chain) and intake camshaft. <b>Engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is applied to an actuator to adjust the camshaft position. Adjustments in the overlap time between the exhaust valve closing and intake valve opening result in improved engine efficiency. Variants of the system, including VVTL-i, Dual VVT-i, VVT-iE, [...] "VVT-iW" [...] and Valvematic, have followed.|$|E
5000|$|The monitor page 1 {{displays}} battery voltage, water temperature, <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> fuel level, vehicle speed, {{engine rotation}} speed, lock/no-lock {{condition of the}} automatic transmission torque converter, and on/off condition of the air conditioning clutch. All except the last two were incorporated with a [...] "buzzer" [...] alarm system that indicate malfunction. Another feature is the one-second-precision 24-hour clock. Estimated arrival time with 1s precision, distance traveled which is incremented every 80 meters and estimated distance to arrival that is also decremented with same value, 80 meters.|$|E
50|$|The cam lobes act {{directly}} on bucket type tappets, which are adjusted {{by means of}} shims between {{the underside of the}} bucket and the top of the valves. Two duplex chains drive the camshafts, one from the crankshaft to a sprocket {{at the level of the}} combustion chambers, and one from the sprocket to each camshaft. The original sprung slipper design of the lower cam chain tensioner proved to be too weak and after a couple of years was changed to an improved hydraulic design, using <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Further {{difficulties}} were encountered {{when the}} engine {{started to be}} used: power output {{was said to be}} only around [...] at around 13,000 rpm, while the novel method of drawing power from the centre of the <b>engine</b> led to <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> problems.|$|R
50|$|On lap 48, tyre {{problems}} struck Regazzoni {{and further}} problems ensued {{when he tried}} to leave the pits after his tyre change to find his <b>engine</b> had no <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> Schenken too dropped down the field with gearbox problems and retired completely when it jammed for good 4 laps from home.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic tappets are tappets {{that contain}} a small {{hydraulic}} piston, pressurised by the <b>engine's</b> lubricating <b>oil</b> supply. Although the piston {{does not move}} appreciably or frequently, it acts as a hydraulic spring that automatically adjusts the tappet clearance according to the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> This makes the valve actuation self-adjusting {{and there is no}} need to adjust the rockers. Hydraulic tappets depend on a supply of clean oil at the appropriate pressure. When starting a cold <b>engine,</b> with low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> hydraulic tappets are often noisy for a few seconds, until they position themselves correctly.|$|R
5000|$|The E-platform New Yorker {{came with}} {{state-of-the-art}} 1980s technology, including a digital dashboard and Electronic Voice Alert, which spoke notifications such as [...] "A door is ajar"; [...] "Please fasten your seat belts"; [...] "Don't forget your keys"; [...] "Thank you" [...] (after fastening seat belt, {{closing the door}} tightly or removing the key from the ignition switch); [...] "Your <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is low - prompt service is required". Also standard was a Landau vinyl roof with electroluminescent opera lamps. This was the only Chrysler New Yorker generation with an inline-four engine.|$|E
5000|$|On October 27, 2011, a Beechcraft King Air, {{serial number}} B-36, {{registered}} C-GXRX, crashed on Russ Baker Way next to Vancouver International Airport in Richmond, British Columbia {{as it was}} attempting to make a landing, killing the pilot, 44-year-old Luc Fortin. It had departed the airport earlier but turned around due to indications of an aircraft malfunction (the <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> indicator); it crashed about 900 metres short of the runway. Five of the nine passengers were seriously injured. On November 16, 2011, the co-pilot of the flight died as well.|$|E
50|$|Three {{methods are}} used to vary the pitch. <b>Engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is the usual {{mechanism}} used in commercial aircraft and the Continental and Lycoming engines fitted to light aircraft. Alternatively, or additionally, centrifugal weights may be attached directly to the propeller as in the Yakovlev Yak-52. Small, modern engines with a CSU, such as the Rotax 912, may use either the traditional hydraulic method or an electrical pitch control mechanism. A pilot requires some additional training and, in most jurisdictions, a formal signoff before being allowed to fly aircraft fitted with a CSU. CSUs {{are not allowed to}} be fitted to aircraft certified under light-sport aircraft regulations in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|The first Model 77 was a rigid-framed telescopic-forked Dominator {{version of}} 500 cc {{produced}} from 1950, and supplied to the Australian market only. This used the all-iron Dominator 500 cc twin <b>engine,</b> with an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> gauge in the ES2 style but flat-bottomed petrol tank. About 240 were made, from 1950 to 1952.|$|R
50|$|Engines with hydraulictappets (such as the Buick/RoverV8) {{often have}} {{in effect a}} rev limiter {{by virtue of their}} design. Thetappet {{clearances}} are maintained by the flow of the engine's lubricating oil.At high <b>engine</b> speeds, the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> rises {{to such an extent that}} thetappets 'pump up', causing valve float. This sharply reduces engine power,causing speed to drop.|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} 4 reasons for low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> 1) no <b>oil</b> or low <b>oil</b> in the <b>engine</b> 2) worn or {{defective}} oil pump or broken {{pressure relief valve}} spring 3) worn main bearings (big ends {{have nothing to do}} with <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> as most of the pressure to these are supplied by centrifugal force and 4) oil gallery fracture or blockage. Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> can cause <b>engine</b> damage. First thing to fail will be cam carrier bearings if vehicle is OHC as this is fed through a restrictor and low pressure will starve top of engine of lube.If pistons have crown jets eg scania,could cause piston/liner nip. Also the crankshaft and connecting rod bearings will seize. Indications of low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> may be that the warning light is on, a low pressure reading on the gauge, or clattering/clinking noises from the <b>engine.</b> Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is a problem that must be addressed immediately to prevent serious damage.|$|R
5000|$|The oil {{pressure}} idiot light lights when <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> drops below a predetermined level. The light normally appears when the vehicle ignition is turned on, but {{the engine is}} not running, as it detects no {{oil pressure}} due to the oil pump not operating (the oil pump is powered off the crankshaft, so only operates when the engine is running). It normally turns off a few seconds after engine start as the oil pump starts working and building up oil pressure. This tell-tale can bear the legend [...] or a pictogram of an oil can. Some cars illuminate the light red or yellow, depending on the action needed to be taken.|$|E
5000|$|On 25 June 2017 a Primera Air Boeing 737-800 {{operating}} Jet2 flight LS602 from Palma, Mallorca to East Midlands, UK, {{aborted take-off}} just {{before entering the}} runway. This was reported by the flight crew as [...] "due to an <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> light being illuminated" [...] resulting in the aircraft being returned to the stand. After diagnostic work by an engineer, during which time passengers were held on board, a second attempt for departure was made approximately one hour forty minutes late. Take-off was abandoned mid-runway during acceleration for take-off, the fault this time reported as an engine air valve. The flight was abandoned resulting in passengers eventually being dispersed to local hotels eight hours after the scheduled flight time.|$|E
5000|$|VEB The Volvo Engine Brake is a {{compression}} type {{engine brake}} first introduced on D12A and since used on later designed OHC engines from 9 to 16 litre displacement. The brake operates on a principle where exhaust valve cam followers acts on secondary cam profile when engine brake is activated. <b>Engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is used to}} eliminate extra valve clearance thus this action forces the follower against secondary lobes and unseating exhaust valves temporarily to achieve so-called compression bleeding as employed by similar systems from Jacobs, Cummins and Mack however Volvo system has an extra cam lobe thus giving two openings of the exhaust valves and is designed to work in conjunction with an exhaust brake so two of the engine's four strokes are used to raise engine braking effect - Exhaust and Compression strokes.|$|E
50|$|The JPS Team BMW M3 of Jim Richards and Tony Longhurst held {{second place}} {{late in the}} race and Richards was contesting the lead with Fury on the now damp track due to light rain until the 2.3 L <b>engine</b> lost <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> on lap 118. Just five laps earlier, the Holden VL Commodore of Peter Brock had been holding a strong third place comfortably in front of Perkins until his front brakes {{suddenly}} gave {{out at the end}} of pit straight. Brock slid sideways into the sandtrap and was lucky not to roll the Commodore after the driver's side wheels dug into the sand.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "idiot light" [...] {{terminology}} {{arises from}} popular frustration with automakers' use of lights for crucial functions which could previously be monitored by gauges, so a troublesome condition could be detected and corrected early. Such {{early detection of}} problems with, for example, <b>engine</b> temperature or <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> or charging system operation is not possible via an idiot light, which lights only when a fault has already occurred - thus providing no advance warnings or details of the malfunction's extent. The Hudson automobile company {{was the first to}} use lights instead of gauges for <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> and the voltmeter, starting in the mid-1930s.|$|R
50|$|It was {{an event}} to forget for {{defending}} champion Nasser Al-Attiyah. He lost nine minutes {{during the first}} stage after his Hummer's <b>engine</b> lost <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> The Qatari {{went on to win}} the second stage, but lost over half an hour to Peterhansel in the fourth stage; winning the seventh stage had seen Al-Attiyah recover to sixth place before engine and alternator problems during the ninth stage warranted his retirement. Teammate Robby Gordon was at this stage just five minutes behind Peterhansel with a win on the ninth stage, but the gap increased to 20 minutes when the American hit a rock on the tenth stage. An illegal modification to his Hummer's engine then saw Gordon disqualified, though he continued to compete under appeal for the remainder of the rally. He would have finished fifth in the overall classification with three further stage wins, Toyota driver Lucio Alvarez inheriting the position as a result of Gordon losing the appeal.|$|R
50|$|In {{most modern}} installations, an {{electronic}} device called a tachometric relay or safety switch {{is used to}} operate electrical shut-off solenoids. These work by sensing that the engine is running by detecting ignition pulses. Some systems use an <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor instead. In all installations, there is a filterlock (consisting of a filter assembly and a vacuum or electric solenoid operated shut-off valve) located at the input to the converter. In European converters, {{there is also a}} solenoid in the converter to shut off the idle circuit. These valves are usually both connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. Where solenoids are fitted to the outputs of fuel tanks, these are also connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. In installations with multiple tanks, a switch or changeover relay may be fitted to allow the driver to select which tank to use fuel from. On bi-fuel, the switch used to change between fuels is used to turn off the tachometric relay.|$|E
50|$|The Yuba City bus {{disaster}} {{occurred on}} May 21, 1976 in Martinez, California. A 1950 Crown bus operated by Student Transportation Lines, Inc. had been chartered {{to carry the}} Yuba City High School a cappella choir from Yuba City to Miramonte High School in Orinda for a friendship day involving the choirs of the two schools. The accident occurred at 10:55 a.m., as the driver took the Marina Vista (exit 56) off-ramp from I-680 southbound from the Benicia-Martinez Bridge. The driver was unfamiliar with this bus, and mistakenly thought the low air pressure warning (for the air brakes) was a warning of low <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> The driver left the freeway at the aforementioned off ramp, and the brakes failed {{due to lack of}} air pressure. The bus struck and mounted the bridge rail and left the elevated roadway, falling 21.6 feet. It landed upside down and crushed the roof {{to the bottom of the}} bus windows. Out of 52 passengers on board, twenty-eight students and an adult adviser were killed. All of the surviving passengers were injured, most critically. The driver survived the crash but was seriously hurt.|$|E
5000|$|A further engine {{problem was}} that of uncommanded opening of the {{variable}} thrust nozzle (usually through loss of <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> as the nozzles were actuated using engine oil as hydraulic fluid); although the engine would be running normally at high power, {{the opening of the}} nozzle resulted in a drastic loss of thrust. A modification program installed a manual nozzle closure control which reduced the problem. The engine was also known to suffer from afterburner blowout on takeoff, or even non-ignition, resulting in a major loss of thrust that could be detected by the pilot - the recommended action was to abandon the takeoff. The first fatal accident in German service was caused by this phenomenon. Some aircrews experienced uncommanded [...] "stick kicker" [...] activation at low level when flying straight and level, so F-104 crews often flew with the system deactivated. Asymmetric flap deployment was another common cause of accidents, as was a persistent problem with severe nose wheel [...] "shimmy" [...] on landing that usually resulted in the aircraft leaving the runway and in some cases even flipping over onto its back.|$|E
50|$|Ordered in February 1949, Labrador {{was built}} in the Marine Industries LTD yards at Sorel, Quebec with the yard number 187. The vessel was laid down on 18 November 1949 and {{launched}} on 14 December 1951, christened by Jeanne St. Laurent, the wife of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. The ship was commissioned on 8 July 1954. On 10 July 1954 Labrador departed Sorel, Quebec, en route to her new homeport in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. Whilst underway the vessel experienced <b>engine</b> troubles (lowered <b>oil</b> <b>pressure),</b> between Sorel and Quebec City, Quebec. Further difficulty was experienced in the Richelieu River, where she developed steering gear problems which were fixed. Labrador arrived at Halifax on 14 July 1954.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} entries by a 1959 Thunderbird and Pontiac would have its fastest vehicle finish in fourth place. The Dodge driven by Bobby Waddell would finish in 29th {{and be the}} only entry for that manufacturer. Most of the DNFs were caused by crashes (the rest were caused by <b>engines,</b> handling, and <b>oil</b> <b>pressure).</b> Richard Petty would be noted for {{finishing}} in last place. This would be {{one out of the}} fifteen times in his 35-year-long NASCAR Cup Series career that he would finish a race in last place. However, his final last place finish would be at the 1989 Holly Farms 400 race that took place at North Wilkesboro Speedway.|$|R
50|$|GS-T adds: {{turbocharged}} and intercooled <b>engine,</b> <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> cooler, air conditioning, cruise control, turbo boost and <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> gauges, Infinity 8-speaker AM/FM cassette/CD {{player with}} separate amplifier, anti-theft system and CD changer controls, power windows/door locks, sport-tuned shock absorbers, 16-inch alloy 5 spoke wheels, bright dual exhaust outlets.|$|R
