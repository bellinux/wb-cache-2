Science of accounting considers that the problematic of choosing <b>accounting</b> <b>systems</b> is a big question mark.

Neo-institutional theory {{has been used as a}} theoretical framework for connecting the objective and empirical data of the study to the analysis and conclusion. A qualitative study has been conducted on 15 chief financial officers in their respective municipalities.
