Company director José María González said {{that the company had}} received no such calls, and thought that callers might have <b>dialed</b> <b>the</b> 911 emergency number instead. Prosecutor Camporini reported at the trial that the building had experienced several gas leaks before the explosion.|$|E
25|$|The {{panel system}} was {{designed}} to interconnect the offices of a city or a local calling area. Each office was assigned a two- (later three) digit office code. Callers <b>dialed</b> <b>the</b> office code followed by the station number. In most situations this led to six-digit (later seven) numbers. But from the beginning the panel system handled seven-digit numbers (later eight), for two reasons. Party line numbers were listed {{with one of the}} letters J, M, R, and W following the line number. The caller <b>dialed</b> <b>the</b> office code, the line number, and the digit corresponding to the letter. The panel system {{was designed to}} work with manual offices of up to 10,500 lines. To call a line in a manual office, callers <b>dialed</b> <b>the</b> office code followed by the line number, just as they would when calling a number in a fully automatic office. For lines 10,000 and up, callers therefore <b>dialed</b> <b>the</b> office code and a five-digit line number.|$|E
25|$|The rotary dial is {{a device}} mounted on or in a {{telephone}} or switchboard {{that is designed to}} send electrical pulses, known as pulse dialing, corresponding to the number <b>dialed.</b> <b>The</b> early form of the rotary dial used lugs on a finger plate instead of holes. The rotary dial was invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891. Strowger filed U.S. patent#486,909 on December 21, 1891 that was later issued on November 29, 1892.|$|E
5000|$|A caller {{from outside}} Azerbaijan would <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> {{international}} access number (international call prefix) of the originating country (00 for many countries, 011 from NANP areas), then <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> country code (in this case 994), omit the trunk prefix, then <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> two-digit area code, {{and then the}} seven-digit local number.|$|R

25|$|Some {{wireless}} carriers such as Nextel {{have decided}} GPS {{was the best}} way to provide the mandated location data for wireless Enhanced 9-1-1. Newer Nextel radios have embedded GPS receivers which are polled if 9-1-1 is <b>dialed.</b> <b>The</b> 9-1-1 center is provided with latitude and longitude from the radio's GPS receiver. In centers with computer assisted dispatch, the system may assign an address to the call based on these coordinates or may project an icon depicting the caller's location onto a map of the area.|$|E
25|$|When a {{subscriber}} <b>dialed</b> <b>the</b> {{number of}} a manual station, an operator at the destination office answered the call {{after seeing the}} number on an indicator, and connected the call by plugging a cord into the outgoing circuit and ringing the destination station. For example, if a dial customer calling from TAylor 4725 dialed a number served by a manual exchange, e.g., ADams 1383-W, the call was completed, from the subscriber’s perspective, exactly as a call to LEnnox 5813, in an automated exchange. The party line letters W, R, J, and M were only used in manual exchanges with jack-per-line party lines.|$|E
25|$|For {{compatibility}} with manual offices, {{two types of}} signaling were supported. In areas with mostly machine switches and a few manual switchboards, Panel Call Indicator (PCI) signaling lit lamps on the B operator's desk at the terminating manual office. The lamps illuminated digits on a display panel corresponding to the number <b>dialed.</b> <b>The</b> manual operator connected the call to the appropriate jack, and then repeated the process for the next incoming call. In areas with mostly manual switches, the Call Annunciator signaling system was used to avoid installing lamp panels at every operator station. The Call Annunciator used speech recorded on strips of photographic film to verbally announce the called number to the answering operator.|$|E
50|$|In the 1940s, with <b>the</b> {{advent of}} <b>dial</b> pulse and {{multi-frequency}} operator <b>dialing,</b> <b>the</b> operator would plug into a tandem trunk and <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> NPA (area code) and operator code {{for the information}} operator in the distant city. For instance, the New York City information operator was 212-131. If the customer knew the number, and the point was direct-dialable, <b>the</b> operator would <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> call. If the distant city did not have dialable numbers, <b>the</b> operator would <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> code for the inward operator serving the called party, and ask her to ring the number.|$|R

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s, many local {{telephone}} companies, {{as well as}} the North American Numbering Plan of 1947, prescribed telephone number formats that included the name of the central office to which each telephone was connected. Traditionally, these names were often the names of towns, villages, other locally significant names, but larger communities that required more than one central office, may have used other names for each central office, such as Main, East, West, Central. Names were convenient to use and reduced errors when telephone numbers were exchanged verbally between subscribers and operators. When subscribers could dial themselves, the initial letters of the names were converted to digits as displayed on the rotary dial. Thus, telephone numbers contained one, two, or even three letters followed by up to five numerals. Such numbering plans are called 2L-4N, or simply 2-4, for example, as shown in the photo of a telephone dial of 1939 (right). In this example, LAkewood 2697, indicates that a subscriber <b>dialed</b> <b>the</b> letters L and A, then the digits 2, 6, 9, and 7 to reach this telephone in Lakewood, NJ (USA).|$|E
25|$|The {{investigators}} were thus able {{to recreate the}} bombers activities. Amrozi, Idris and Ali Imron had simply walked into a dealership and purchased a new Yamaha motorbike, after asking how much they could re-sell it for if they returned it in a few days. Imron used the motorbike to plant the small bomb outside the U.S. Consulate. Idris then rode the motorbike as Imron drove two suicide bombers in the Mitsubishi to the nightclub district in Kuta. He stopped near the Sari Club, instructed one suicide bomber {{to put on his}} explosives vest and the other to arm the vehicle bomb. The first bomber headed to Paddy's Pub. Idris then left the second bomber, who had only learned to drive in a straight line, to drive the minivan the short distance to the Sari Club. Idris picked up Imron on the Yamaha and the duo headed back into Denpasar. Idris <b>dialed</b> <b>the</b> number of the Nokia to detonate the bomb at the Consulate. The two suicide bombers exploded their devices. Imron and Idris dropped the motorbike at a place where it eventually attracted the attention of the caretaker.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{an address}} is <b>dialed,</b> <b>the</b> gate {{is said to}} have created a [...] "stable wormhole" [...] between itself and the gate <b>dialed.</b> <b>The</b> {{creation}} process is depicted with great consistency, and hence {{has become one of the}} defining motifs of Stargate, at times being central in both the SG-1 and Atlantis title sequences. It involves the generation of the [...] "puddle of water" [...] portal which lasts roughly 2 seconds, and is completed by the ejection of an unstable energy vortex resembling a surge of water or quicksilver. The vortex is portrayed as a symbol of the stargate's power, invariably causing characters to become affected by awe. Any matter which comes into contact with the vortex is annihilated on a molecular level, as is dramatically demonstrated by a pair of smoking shoes in the episode [...] "Prisoners". In season 9's [...] "Crusade", the unstable vortex was onomatopoeidiacally referred to by Col. Carter as the [...] "Kawoosh", emulating the sound of the initial vortex. This aspect has been used in some cases to dispose of highly hazardous materials. The vortex is also used on one occasion to dispose of a body in a formal funeral service - the body was placed on a pyre in front of the gate, which was then activated.|$|E
2500|$|The show is {{consistent}} with the mechanics of address-dialing.

The main [...] "address" [...] is invariably dialed first, and the last symbol is the [...] "point of origin", representing the gate being used, which acts as the final trigger for the completion of the address sequence. As each symbol is <b>dialed,</b> <b>the</b> chevron is said to [...] "engage" [...] or [...] "encode" [...] and usually responds by lighting up or moving. When the final symbol of an address is dialed, that chevron is said to [...] "lock" [...] and the wormhole opens (this terminology is arbitrary and often interchangeable, but preferred by the recurring character Walter Harriman). If the address is incorrect or does not correspond to an existing or otherwise functional stargate, the last chevron will not lock, and all of the chevrons will disengage.|$|E
