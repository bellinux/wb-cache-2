40|$|A {{data base}} {{describing}} {{the properties of}} the exhaust cloud produced by the launch of the Space Transportation System and the <b>acidic</b> <b>fallout</b> observed after each of the first four launches was assembled from a series of ground and aircraft based measurements made during the launches of STS 2, 3, and 4. Additional data were obtained from ground-based measurements during firings of the 6. 4 percent model of the Solid Rocket Booster at the Marshall Center. Analysis indicates that the <b>acidic</b> <b>fallout</b> is produced by atomization of the deluge water spray by the rocket exhaust on the pad followed by rapid scavening of hydrogen chloride gas aluminum oxide particles from the Solid Rocket Boosters. The atomized spray is carried aloft by updrafts created by the hot exhaust and deposited down wind. Aircraft measurements in the STS- 3 ground cloud showed an insignificant number of ice nuclei. Although no measurements were made in the column cloud, the possibility of inadvertent weather modification caused by the interaction of ice nuclei with natural clouds appears remote...|$|R

40|$|Acid rain is {{a general}} term used to {{describe}} either wet or <b>dry</b> <b>acidic</b> deposition. Wet acidic deposition is what is {{commonly referred to as}} acid rain {{as it is in the}} form of rain, snow or fog. Dry deposition can be equally as important as wet deposition, but is in the form of acidic gases and particles. Scientists prefer to use the term acid deposition in referring to acid rain, as it includes both wet and dry deposition. All rain is naturally acidic with a pH of around 5. 5. The majority of the acid rain that falls in the United States has a pH of 4. 3 (www. epa. gov/airmarkets/acidrain). It is difficult to measure the percentage of acid that is in the form of wet deposition, as when rain falls it can mix with dry deposition. Acid rain is formed mainly by the combustion of fossil fuels, specifically coal and oil and smelting of iron ores that release pollutants into the atmosphere. Acid rain is formed through two main sources. The sources are categorized as primary and secondary pollutants. Primary pollutants are from industrial and domestic human activities and include sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and nitric oxides (NOx). Secondary pollutants are formed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere with primary pollutants. The most importan...|$|R

Application of P and K fertilizer and addition of organic matter (ameliorant) are expected to overcome the problems. The objectives {{of this study was to}} investigate the application of ameliorant on growth and yield of four groundnut varieties on <b>acidic</b> <b>dry</b> land planted in Bengkulu. The experiment was carried out on <b>acidic</b> <b>dry</b> land in Central Bengkulu from June to September 2014 in the dry season.

The results showed that addition ameliorant was significantly different in plant height in early growth phase of peanut 28 and 42 days after planting (DAP) while for number of branch there is no significantly different.
