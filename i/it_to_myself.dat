Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, and you know {{it was kind of a}} moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout his life, Rudolph {{suffered}} from a gambling problem and was labeled a [...] "compulsive gambler". [...] He would often spend his leisure time placing bets at race tracks and Las Vegas, Nevada and Puerto Rico casinos. At that time, NBA referees were allowed to gamble, but this practice has since been prohibited. [...] As he incurred gambling losses, Rudolph was once offered by a Las Vegas gambler to erase his outstanding debt by participating in point shaving. [...] However, he {{refused to accept the}} offer and said to his wife, [...] "It goes against all my principles. I love the game too much, respect it too much. I couldn't do it to you. I couldn't do it to the memory of my father, and I couldn't do <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> If I have to go into bankruptcy, something I'd hate to do, I'd do it," [...] according to in a 1992 New York Times interview with Susan Rudolph. [...] Rudolph had cashed in his $60,000 pension fund to pay debts and he still owed an additional $100,000. [...] While he refused to seek professional help, Rudolph cut back on his gambling habit later in his life.|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, {{speculation}} arose that Walton {{had taken}} a medical leave; however, Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada reported {{that she had been}} asked to accept a salary cut and had decided to leave. The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as [...] "late '50s, Caucasian, female. This [...] woman is a smart and confident CEO of a successful company. She is a mother and grandmother who wants what is best for her family." [...] However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill. She later clarified her departure as having to do with [...] "family and this economy". She stated: [...] "I felt so bad that so many people have lost their jobs, that, all of a sudden, I thought: 'This is really silly. I have a wonderful job and I really think I owe <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> and my family to continue on.'" [...] In February 2012, Walton signed a new contract with the soap opera, which would continue her portrayal of the role for an unspecified amount of time. The actress was then announced to be taking a leave of absence beginning that April, slated to last six months. [...] She made her return on November 2, 2012. After her return, Walton confirmed in an interview with Soap Opera Digest that she had voluntarily dropped to recurring status to allow for more time with her family.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> sounded <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> {{a clumsy}} ruse. I {{wondered}} if she would suspect what was behind it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{must tell}} you something. I had meant <b>to</b> keep <b>it</b> entirely <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> but I know that you and Anundee will keep my secret." ...|$|R

2500|$|Conley {{said the}} album was [...] "more {{aggressive}} and more dark" [...] compared to In Reverie, and that paranoia was the main lyrical theme behind it. He described [...] "Head for the Hills" [...] as being [...] "thoughts that creep up and swallow you, and you can't ignore the negative, the hell inside". Conley said [...] "Don't Know Why [...] my blues. It's one of those songs that keeps me off the ledge personally. I sing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> {{all the time when}} I'm at home alone." [...] On the album's sound, Conley revealed that the group purposefully [...] "kept it simple," [...] relying solely on two guitars, bass and drums, attempting to create [...] "a raw album" [...] in the process. After finishing recording the material, Conley referred to it as [...] "quite different" [...] compared to In Reverie. The album's sound has been described as emo, pop, pop punk and power pop.|$|E
2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, that's what I {{tell your}} father. But when <b>it</b> comes <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> I see {{how hard it}} is for him to rest quiet. I'm afraid we shall all do {{something}} we'll repent of afterwards." ...|$|R
60|$|Such is {{the speech}} that I would make if it were possible. As it is, I can only rehearse <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I ever put <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> so distinctly, {{but it appears}} to me now that I must have reached some such conclusion." ...|$|E

6000|$|I had {{the road}} all <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> and I fairly flew--leastways, I had <b>it</b> all <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the buzzing of the rain, and the {{thrashing}} of the wind, and the splitting of the thunder; and sure {{as you are}} born I did clip it along! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma, I want to {{give some}} away to my friends, while I am able <b>to</b> give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> them <b>myself.</b> Won't you ask aunty to come and cut it for me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'None, sir,' {{answered}} Flora. 'I owe <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> to {{say that}} I never yet saw the person on whom I thought {{with reference to the}} present subject.' ...|$|E
60|$|The name so {{astonished}} me that I {{remained silent}} for quite two minutes during which I repeated <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> {{many times to}} fix it in my memory.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I haven't got it, Mr Pancks,' Defaulter would reply. 'I {{tell you}} the truth, sir, when I say I haven't got {{so much as a}} single sixpence of <b>it</b> <b>to</b> bless <b>myself</b> with.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{this house}} was blazing {{from the roof}} to the ground,' she returned, 'I would stay in <b>it</b> <b>to</b> justify <b>myself</b> against my righteous motives being classed with those of stabbers and thieves.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh--I don't know--I forgot! No, I didn't forget. I did <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{discipline}} <b>myself.</b> I have scrubbed {{the stairs}} since eight o'clock. I MUST practise myself in my household duties. I've shamefully neglected them!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I do. It was a deal {{too good}} to keep <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> 'American manners!'" [...] As he said this he almost succeeded in looking like Lady Clanfiddle.|$|E
6000|$|There was a moment's silence. I {{drew the}} piece of paper from my pocket, as though by accident, and read <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> There were only a few hastily scrawled lines:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only knew}} last night for certain. Thank God, I kept <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> He thinks himself safe as Mr. Marx--safer than flying {{the country as}} the Count de Cartienne--the villain!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'll swear I did! He didn't touch me. I did <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> in a passion, {{and threw}} myself down here. He wasn't near me. He never {{laid a hand}} upon me!" ...|$|E

60|$|So far, I listened quietly enough, {{naturally}} supposing that Mrs. Eyrecourt {{trusted to}} her own arguments and persuasions.

6000|$|... "If I {{find any}} little thing wants doing {{urgently}} when I get there," [...] David promised carelessly, [...] "I will have <b>it</b> seen <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> If the rent you ask is not prohibitive, {{it is exactly}} the place I should like to take for, say, a year, at any rate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly. However {{difficult}} I {{may find}} <b>it</b> <b>to</b> persuade <b>myself</b> that Miss Hawtrey {{is in any}} way the woman you picture her, I am as convinced as you are that it is absolutely necessary that the money should be paid.' ...|$|R
