50|$|In an {{isotonic}} contraction, tension {{remains the}} same, whilst the muscle's length changes. Isotonic contractions differ from <b>isokinetic</b> contractions in that in <b>isokinetic</b> contractions the muscle speed remains constant. While superficially identical, as the muscle's force changes via the length-tension relationship during a contraction, an isotonic contraction will keep force constant while velocity changes, but an <b>isokinetic</b> contraction will keep velocity constant while force changes.

50|$|There are few {{topics in}} {{chemistry}} in {{which so many}} misunderstandings and controversies have arisen as {{in connection with the}} so-called <b>isokinetic</b> relationship (IKR) or compensation law. Up to date, a great many chemists appear to be inclined to dismiss the IKR as being accidental. The crucial problem is that the activation parameters are mutually dependent because of their determination from the experimental data. Therefore, it has been stressed repeatedly, the <b>isokinetic</b> plot (i.e., ΔH‡ against ΔS‡) is unfit in principle to substantiate a claim of an <b>isokinetic</b> relationship. At the same time, however, it is a fatal error to dismiss the IKR because of that fallacy.|$|E

In addition, there are eleven more BMUs used to support more sophisticated experimental setups, including: spring, friction, additional moment of inertia or mass, pseudo-gravitational, position control, velocity control, torque/force control, power control, physical elements, extended torque or force control and quick release.|$|E

5000|$|Many of {{the more}} popular terms used in {{discussing}} the compensation effect are specific to their field or phenomena. In these contexts, the disambiguous terms are of course preferred. The misapplication of and frequent crosstalk between fields on this matter has, however, often led to the use of inappropriate terms and a confusing picture to be painted. For the purposes of this entry it is thus important to note that different terms may be used to refer to what may seem to be the same effect, but that either a term is being used as a shorthand (<b>isokinetic</b> and isoequilibrium relationships are different, yet are often grouped together synecdochically as <b>isokinetic</b> relationships for the sake of brevity) or is the correct term in context. This section should aid in resolving any uncertainties. (see Criticism section for more on the variety of terms) ...|$|E

50|$|A {{hand-held}} {{particle counter}} is a small, self-contained device that is easily transported and used, and {{designed for use}} with Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) investigations.

However longer sample times may be required when performing cleanroom certification and testing. (Hand-held counters are not recommended for cleanrooms). Most hand-held particle counters have direct mount <b>isokinetic</b> sampling probes. One may use a barbed probe on a short piece of sample tubing, but it is recommended that the length of the tubing not exceed 6 ft, due to loss of larger particles in the sample tubing.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Isokinetic</b> Cannon {{was seen}} in only one episode of Star Trek: Voyager, [...] "Retrospect". Voyager met with a weapons trader and {{designer}} known as Kovin. It destroyed a target buoy composed of 10 m thick solid monotanium with a chromoelectric forcefield in one shot, coring it cleanly through. However, Kovin was killed before {{the installation of the}} weapon. Though the weapon was never known to have been removed from Voyager, it was never seen in use nor referred to again. It is presumed that the diplomatic fallout that resulted from the circumstances surrounding Kovin's death led to the demo version being removed from Voyager and the deal to have it permanently installed being cancelled.|$|E
