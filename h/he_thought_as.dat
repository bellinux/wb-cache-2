5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse – {{a figure that}} <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> good as his sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It {{appears to be a}} {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E
25|$|Carleton {{had chosen}} a bleak {{site on the}} Pecos River for his {{reservation}}. This reservation was called Bosque Redondo (Round Grove). He chose this site for the Apaches and Navajos because {{it was far from}} white settlements. He also wanted these Apaches and Navajo to act as a buffer for any aggressive acts committed upon the white settlements from Kiowas and Comanches to the east of Bosque Redondo. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> well that the remoteness and desolation of the reservation would discourage white settlement.|$|E
500|$|Clinton Lawrence {{described}} the last Sector General book, Double Contact (1999), as [...] "in {{a very positive}} way, a throwback to an earlier era in science fiction" [...] since it is optimistic and depicts several advanced species working harmoniously. The struggle to build trust and produce a successful first contact is, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> exciting and suspenseful as one could wish for. However {{he noted that the}} level of characterization was the minimum required to support the plot.|$|E
60|$|It was strange, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> even <b>as</b> <b>he</b> said it, that {{he could}} bring his lips so glibly to utter words that his heart detested.|$|R
6000|$|If she {{realised}} who he was, quite probably {{she would}} not see him. 'By George!' <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> hardening <b>as</b> the tug came. 'It's a topsy-turvy affair!' ...|$|R
60|$|St. Vincent ground {{his teeth}} and pulled the trigger--at least <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> did, <b>as</b> men think they do things in dreams. He willed the deed, flashed the order forth; but the flutter of his soul stopped it.|$|R
500|$|III.1 {{opens with}} the Four Masters' ass narrating how <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> he was [...] "dropping asleep", {{he had heard}} and seen an {{apparition}} of Shaun the Post. As a result, Shaun re-awakens, and, floating down the Liffey in a barrel, is posed fourteen questions concerning the significance {{and content of the}} letter he is carrying. Shaun, [...] "apprehensive about being slighted, is on his guard, and the placating narrators never get a straight answer out of him." [...] Shaun's answers focus on his own boastful personality and his admonishment of the letter's author – his artist brother Shem. After the inquisition Shaun loses his balance and the barrel in which he has been floating careens over and he rolls backwards out of the narrator's earshot, before disappearing completely from view.|$|E
500|$|In October 2012, Brian Tyler {{signed on}} to score the film. According to Tyler, he was {{approached}} more for his [...] "thematic" [...] scores such as The Greatest Game Ever Played, Annapolis and Partition rather than his [...] "modern" [...] action scores such as The Fast and Furious films, with Kevin Feige asking a theme that was recognizable and featured those dramatic tones. To employ the [...] "deeply thematic component with a strong melody," [...] the score employs mostly orchestra sounds. The main theme for Iron Man focuses on horns and trumpets, to be [...] "both a march and anthem." [...] Tyler mentioned that John Williams' work in Raiders of the Lost Ark {{was the first thing}} <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> an influence, and the cue for the Well of Souls in Raiders influenced the Extremis motif, as Tyler felt it should enhance an spiritual side for having a [...] "technology so advanced that nears magic." [...] Echoing the Mandarin's amalgamated personality, his theme was religious music [...] "that borrows from many cultures," [...] from [...] "Monastic, Gothic, and Christian chants to music from the Middle-East." [...] The score was recorded with the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios. Tyler is the third primary composer to score an Iron Man film, following Ramin Djawadi of Iron Man and John Debney of Iron Man 2.|$|E
2500|$|After being discharged, it was {{recommended}} by doctors of Hazelden that Clapton not partake in any activities that {{would act as}} triggers for his alcoholism or stress. A few months after his discharge, Clapton began working on his next album, against the Hazelden doctors' orders. Working with Tom Dowd, Clapton produced what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> his [...] "most forced" [...] album to date, Money and Cigarettes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear, no! we've {{never been}} on any boat before." [...] She made a little petted mouth of deprecation, and added, simple-heartedly, [...] "My husband was going out on business, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> might <b>as</b> well take me along." ...|$|R

50|$|One of Man Ray's paintings, Hamlet, {{was based}} on a {{photograph}} he took of a Meissner tetrahedron, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>as</b> resembling both Yorick's skull and Ophelia's breast from Shakespeare's Hamlet.|$|R
2500|$|The parody {{generally}} {{follows the}} outline of The Lord of the Rings, including the preface, the prologue, poetry, and songs, while making light of what Tolkien made serious (e.g., [...] "He would have finished him off then and there, but pity stayed his hand. [...] It's a pity I've run out of bullets, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> he went back up the tunnel..."). Names and words in the various languages are parodied with brand names that mimic their sounds (for example, Moxie and Pepsi replace Merry and Pippin). There are many topical references, including once-popular brand names. It has the distinction for a parody of having been continuously in print since it was first published.|$|E
2500|$|John Calvin [...] "was less {{clear-cut}} than Luther on Mary's perpetual virginity but undoubtedly favored it". He {{cautioned against}} what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> [...] "impious speculation" [...] on the topic. In his commentary of Luke 1:34, he rejected as [...] "unfounded and altogether absurd" [...] {{the idea that}} Mary had made a vow of perpetual virginity, saying that [...] "She would, in that case, have committed treachery by allowing herself to be united to a husband, and would have poured contempt on the holy covenant of marriage; which {{could not have been}} done without mockery of God" [...] and adding that {{there is no evidence of}} the existence of such vows at the time. Though celibacy or abstinence within marriage life was not unknown in Jewish tradition in response to God's command and participation in His service. In the Commentary on a Harmony of Matthew, Mark & Luke, Calvin rejected the argument that Mary had other children due to the mention in Scripture of brothers of Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|Marston's brief {{career in}} {{literature}} {{began with a}} foray into the then-fashionable genres of erotic epyllion and satire. In 1598, he published The Metamorphosis of Pigmalion's Image and Certaine Satyres, a book of poetry in imitation of, on the one hand, Ovid, and, on the other, the Satires of Juvenal. [...] He also published another book of satires, The Scourge of Villanie, in 1598. (Marston issued these satires under the pseudonym [...] "W. Kinsayder.") [...] The satire in these books is even more savage and misanthropic than is normal for the decade's satirists. Marston's style is, moreover, in places contorted {{to the point of}} unintelligibility: he believed that satire should be rough and obscure, perhaps because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> (<b>as</b> did many other writers of the time) that the term 'satire' was derived from the Greek 'satyr plays'. Marston seems to have been enraged by Joseph Hall's claim to be the first satirist in English; Hall comes in for some indirect flyting in {{at least one of the}} satires. Some see William Shakespeare's Thersites and Iago, as well as the mad speeches of King Lear as influenced by The Scourge of Villanie. [...] Marston had, however, arrived on the literary scene as the fad for verse satire was to be checked by censors. The Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift and the Bishop of London Richard Bancroft banned the Scourge and had it publicly burned, along with copies of works by other satirists, on 4 June 1599.|$|E

6000|$|... "In {{what can}} one trust, then?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> he leant there. So feeble and insubstantial did he feel {{himself that he}} {{repeated}} the word aloud.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, that's quite evident," [...] the {{adjutant}} agreed. [...] "I {{dare say}} his friends {{gave him a}} hundred or two to start on a farm, and {{when he decided to}} join us <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> might <b>as</b> well spend it, and have a final piece of extravagance." ...|$|R
25|$|Besides {{teaching}} about Zen {{practice and the}} history of Zen (Chan) Buddhism, Suzuki was an expert scholar on the related philosophy called, in Japanese, Kegon, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>as</b> the intellectual explication of Zen experience.|$|R
60|$|The boy {{was rapidly}} {{changing}} to the man. His mother's words beating upon his brain aroused something in him {{which he had}} not hitherto acknowledged. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> deeply <b>as</b> <b>he</b> peered into her eyes, burning with resolution.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder how}} it {{happened}} that I didn't see that {{when they left the}} last camp?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> Tim put the bundle carefully in the inside pocket of his coat.|$|E
6000|$|Rufus {{noticed his}} hat and gloves on the table, and left him without saying more. [...] "The trouble with Amelius," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> he closed the cottage gate, [...] "is not over yet." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{gambling}} {{game with}} this name {{goes back to}} the 16th century, being known to Gerolamo Cardano <b>as</b> , which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>as</b> the noblest of all card games, to François Rabelais as , and to Shakespeare as primero.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who could foresee such a thing?" [...] the old {{man said}} plaintively. He might have added Major Clutterbuck's {{thousand}} pounds as another item to be cleared, but <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it <b>as</b> well to keep silent upon the point.|$|R
60|$|Harding nodded. Blake was {{not given}} to serious conversation; indeed, he was rather casual, as a rule, but Harding, who was shrewd, saw beneath the surface a love of order, and what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>as</b> {{constructive}} ability.|$|R
6000|$|... "Looking for {{the girl}} had brought him into trouble, more than likely," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> he rode away from Honnewell, taking a due south course. [...] "And what can have become of her?" ...|$|E

60|$|As he hesitated, the {{recollection}} of Monk's veiled threats {{came back to}} him, and he wavered no longer. He opened the box again, took out the contents, and dropped them into his pocket.

60|$|The {{whole scene}} was both {{beautiful}} and strange to Olaf, {{and would have}} filled him with intense delight, if he could only have got rid of that uncomfortable feeling about its being forbidden ground!
