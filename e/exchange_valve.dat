40|$|A mass {{spectrometer}} and computer system {{was developed for}} conducting a fundamental study on gas monitoring in a Controlled Ecological Life Support System. Respiration and metabolism of the hamster and photosynthesis of the Spirulina were measured in a combination system consisting of a hamster chamber and a Spirulina cultivator. They are connected through a membrane gas exchanger. Some technical problems were examined. In the mass spectrometric gas monitoring, a simultaneous multisample measurement was developed by employing a rotating <b>exchange</b> <b>valve.</b> Long term precise measurement was obtained by employing an automatic calibration system. The membrane gas sampling probe proved to be useful for long term measurement. The cultivation rate of the Spirulina was effectively changed by controlling CO 2 and light supply. The experimental results are helpful for improving the hamster-spirulina system...|$|E

40|$|A {{thermal cycling}} {{absorption}} process (TCAP) for hydrogen isotope separation {{has been in}} operation at Savannah River Site since 1994. The process uses a hot/cold nitrogen system to cycle {{the temperature of the}} separation column. The hot/cold nitrogen system requires the use of large compressors, heat <b>exchanges,</b> <b>valves</b> and piping that is bulky and maintenance intensive. A new compact thermal cycling (CTC) design has recently been developed. This new design uses liquid nitrogen tubes and electric heaters to heat and cool the column directly so that the bulky hot/cold nitrogen system can be eliminated. This CTC design is simple and is easy to implement, and will be the next generation TCAP system at SRS. A twelve-meter column has been fabricated and installed in the laboratory to demonstrate its performance. The design of the system and its test results to date is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This book {{reports on}} a novel {{approach}} for generating mechanical energy from different, external heat sources using {{the body of a}} typical piston engine with valves. By presenting simple yet effective numerical models, the authors show how this new approach, which combines existing internal combustion technology with a lubrication system, is able to offer an economic {{solution to the problem of}} mechanical energy generation in piston engines. Their results also show that a stable heat generation process can be guaranteed outside of the engine. The book offers a detailed report on physical and numerical models of 4 -stroke and 2 -stroke versions of the EHVE together with different models of heat <b>exchange,</b> <b>valves</b> and results of their simulations. It also delivers the test results of an engine prototype run in laboratory conditions. By presenting a novel theoretical framework and providing readers with extensive knowledge of both the advantages and challenges of the method, this book is expected to inspire academic researchers, advanced PhD students and professionals in their search for more effective solutions to the problem of renewable energy generation...|$|R
40|$|Mitral valve {{diseases}} and disorders affect {{tens of thousands}} of Americans each year, but understanding of the disease processes has yet to be fully developed. The behavior and characteristics of valve cells and tissue are highly dependent on their surrounding environment, including neighboring cells, extracellular matrix composition and 3 D structure, mechanical forces, and signaling molecules both in the tissue and the circulation. In order to study native valve behavior and responses, an ex vivo bioreactor system was developed to culture whole mitral valves. The organ culture system simulated a physiologically relevant mechanical environment and provided nutrients and gas <b>exchange.</b> <b>Valves</b> cultured in this dynamic system retained more native cell and tissue characteristics than valves cultured in a static environment. To utilize this novel tool, a study was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} Angiotensin II on mitral valves, alone and in combination with the statin drug, Simvastatin. Angiotensin II was found to alter the native valve composition. Simvastatin inhibited some of these alterations, but accentuated others and also affected separate valve characteristics. In conclusion, an organ culture system for mitral valves has been designed, characterized, validated, and effectively put to use in a novel study...|$|R

30|$|The Stark {{decelerator}} {{is loaded}} with a molecular beam that is produced in a relatively large source chamber, that is pumped by a 1200 l/s turbo pump. The molecular beams formed are thus not limited by interactions with the vacuum chambers walls, or by limited pumping capacity. A 3 mm diameter commercially available skimmer (Beam Dynamics, model 2) is positioned between the source chamber and the Stark decelerator. A unique feature of our apparatus is that this skimmer is mounted on a movable gate valve [34], such that the source chamber can be vented {{without the need for}} breaking the vacuum in the remainder of the apparatus. This ensures the fast <b>exchange</b> of <b>valves</b> or adjustment of valve-to-skimmer distance.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} the ultra-high vacuum system for the beam-line from the 160 -kV polarized-electron gun to the linac injector in the Stanfort Linear Collider (SLC). The polarized electron source IS a GaAs photocathode, requiring 10 -â€œ-Torr-range pressure- for adequate quantum efficiency and longevity. The photocathode is illuminated by 3 -nsec-long laser pulses. Photo cathode maintenance and improvements require occasional _. substitution of guns with rapid restoration of UHV conditions. Differential pumping is crucial since the pressure in the injector is more than 10 times greater than the pho [...] tocathode can tolerate, and since electron-stimulated gas desorption from beam loss in excess of 0. 1 % of the 20 -nC pulses may poison the photocathode. Our design for the. _ transport line contains a differential pumping region isoiated by a pair of <b>valves.</b> <b>Exchange</b> of guns requires venting only this isolated region which can be restored to UHV rapidly by baking.

5000|$|Even {{the design}} {{aspects of the}} rocker arm's {{geometry}} has been studied and changed to maximize the cam information <b>exchange</b> to the <b>valve</b> which the rocker arm imposes, as set forth by the Miller US Patent, #4,365,785, issued to James Miller on December 28, 1982, {{often referred to as}} the MID-LIFT Patent. Previously, the specific pivot points with rocker arm design was based on older and less efficient theories of over-arcing motion which increased wear on valve tips, valve guides and other valve train components, besides diluting the effective cam lobe information as it was transferred through the rocker arm's motion to the valve. Jim Miller's MID-LIFT Patent set a new standard of rocker arm geometrical precision which defined and duplicated each engine's specific push-rod to valve attack angles, then designing the rocker's pivot points so that an exact perpendicular relationship on both sides of the rocker arm was attained: with the valve and the pushrod, when the valve was at its [...] "mid-lift" [...] point of motion.|$|R
5000|$|One of the JERC's first {{decisions}} was {{to build}} an electronic exchange using the [...] "Switched Highways" [...] system, which employed time division multiplex techniques (TDM), {{while at the same}} time continuing research on alternative solutions to the problem of electronic switching. The [...] "Switched Highways" [...] system was invented by L.R.F Harris at Dollis Hill in 1952. It was also decided that the experimental equipment should provide the full service and maintenance facilities of a comparable electro-mechanical exchange. At the same time the techniques used had to be demonstrably capable of serving the largest existing exchanges. Moreover, the experiment was to be conducted in an exchange giving public service and therefore fully interconnected with the public network. This meant that it would need conversion equipment to enable it to inter-work with the existing system and to use the existing subscribers' apparatus and line plant. For these reasons the Highgate Wood installation was bigger than the small number of lines would have seemed to warrant and about 400,000 electronic components were fitted. Much of the control equipment could have served an exchange of about 7,000 lines. The <b>exchange</b> used both <b>valves</b> and transistors. There were approximately 5000 transistors and 500 valves. The valves were used in the more crucial areas, as the transistors of the day were not up to the required performance.|$|R

The concept is presented throughthe design of a robotic lab facility for automated and teleoperated inspection and maintenance operations by robot manipulators - ranging from simple inspection tasks to advanced maintenance operations. The lab facility is built around two cooperating robot manipulators equipped with sensors measuring temperature, vibrations, gas concentration and sound, and that automatically changes between tools to operate <b>valves,</b> <b>exchange</b> batteries in wireless sensors and to manipulate objects and the integrated process equipment. An interface allow users to startautomated inspection rounds where sensor data are collected, analyzed and compared to the normal operating conditions, and alarms are generated if deviations are detected.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} experimental {{study on the}} patterning of thin films and spin valve devices. Initially {{the change in the}} magnetisation reversal of ferromagnetic Ni 80 Fe 15 Mo 5 thin films was investigated as the shape anisotropy was increased using optical lithography to pattern wire arrays. These structures show a progressive increase in coercivity and a transition between single and two-stage reversal with increasing milling depth. A similar patterning technique was applied to unpinned (Ni 80 Fe 20 /Cu/Ni 80 Fe 20) pseudo spin valve (PSV) structures in order to enhance the coercivity of one of the ferromagnetic layers. The increased coercivity induced by micropatterning changed the natural similarity of the magnetic layers and the structure exhibited a small spin valve response. These initial measurements were carried out with separate milling and electrical characterisation steps. However, it was decided that it would be ideal to design a technique to do in-situ magnetoresistance measurements during milling. This meant that the samples could be milled and characterised in the same step, leading to a much cleaner and more efficient process. In-situ magnetoresistance measurements were carried out during micropatterning of PSV devices, and the measurements showed the evolution in the electrical response as wire structures were gradually milled through the thickness. Contrary to what was expected, the structures showed a maximum spin valve response when fully milled through. The effect of further increasing the shape anisotropy by reducing the wire width, and changing the material properties in the PSV structure has also been investigated. MR measurements were taken as the temperature was increased from 291 K to 493 K, and the results show that the patterned PSV structures have a better thermal stability than <b>exchange</b> biased spin <b>valves</b> with an IrMn pinning layer. The experiment was extended to the nanoscale, and the results show that a significant increase in MR is not observed {{despite the fact that the}} magnetic configuration tends more towards single domain. This is thought to be due to an increase in the initial resistance of the structures. A small increase in MR was observed as the wire width was decreased from 730 to 470 nm, although the spin valve response is heavily dependent on the gallium dosage density during patterning in the Focused Ion Beam (FIB). Micromagnetic simulations were carried out, which agree with the experimental results and showed the change in the magnetisation reversal from rotation to switching as the dimensions were reduced on the nanoscale.
