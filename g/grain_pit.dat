In July, Paddy was worried that Aaron and Robert were continuing their affair and found he was right when he caught them half dressed at the scrapyard. Paddy sent a note to Robert's wife, Chrissie White, telling her to 'rein her cheating husband in'. While helping out at the farm, Paddy fell into a <b>grain</b> <b>pit</b> and injured his leg. Robert then turned on the <b>grain</b> <b>pit</b> to scare Paddy after he discovered that Paddy sent the note to his wife. Paddy fell unconscious {{and was about to}} drown when Robert turned the machine off and went to help, only to be scared off by Andy Sugden's approach. Paddy spent a night in hospital. He suspected Robert of being responsible and this was confirmed when Robert threatened him and his family. A while later, Paddy told Aaron so Aaron planned a night at a lodge with Robert to get him to confess. Worried what Robert might do, Paddy went to the lodge and was shot by Robert. Paddy helped Robert stitch his wound and persuaded him to let him and Aaron leave but Aaron retaliated by telling Chrissie about his affair with Robert. Paddy demanded Aaron leave Robert alone, telling him that it'd be his fault if something happened to his family.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Pit {{morphology}} on sensitized 310 S {{stainless steel}} {{has been studied}} using an image processing method based on reflected light microscopy (profile and surface). Salt Spray test {{has been used to}} induce the pitting corrosion. Morphological pits character do not depend on sensitization heat treatments here applied. Nucleation rates and growth may be associated with quantity and distribution of chromium carbides. This being so, condition I (heating up to 1065 o C during 1 h and air cooling) and condition II (heating up to 1065 o C during 1 h and air cooling followed by reheating up to 670 oC during 5 h and again air cooling) are the most susceptible to pitting, in particular the first one. In these two conditions, pits are nucleated in grains and in grain boundaries, while in condition III (heating up to 1065 o C during 1 h and air cooling followed by reheating up to 620 o C during 24 h and again air cooling), pits are preferentially nucleated in boundaries of small <b>grains.</b> Thence, <b>pits</b> usually grow more rapidly in depth than in width, being able to occur partial or total <b>grains</b> separation. <b>Pits</b> are mainly hemispherical, near-hemispherical, near-conical and near-cylindrical without significant geometric transition associated with an increasing exposure period...|$|R

40|$|To whom does it {{interest}} the identity preservation and traceability of grains? Obviously to the processing industry {{and to the}} final consumer. It interests to the industry because it will process better quality grain with low contamination and at reduced costs. It also interests to the consumer because he will be taking safer and better quality food. Despite the difficulties of implementing identity preservation and traceability programs of grains in Brazil, there are some systems working satisfactorily for meat production, seeds and fruits. In the grain production chain this is the correct right way, technology is available; however, many problems need to be overcome from the field to storage and processing to succeed with quality preservation. There are limitations on storage infrastructures (<b>grain</b> <b>pits</b> and dryers), equipment for measuring quality, trained personnel and silos for segregation. A decision support system was developed {{with the objective of}} recording the procedures for wheat production from the field to the consumer. All the important steps for quality maintenance of stored wheat were evaluated for one year. Monitoring of insect pests and control measures, including application of diatomaceous earth and artificial grain cooling, was carried out during the storage phase. The treatments were evaluated by measuring the presence of insect fragments and determination of the wheat flour quality. Based on a detailed documentation of the procedures, a database was generated to recover information from the process. The decision support system created was a very simple tool, but valuable for traceability of grain quality, which added value to the grain and increased food safety.

40|$|Pitting {{involves}} localized corrosion {{of metals}} {{that can result}} in catastrophic events through crack initiation and failure. Beside the magnitude and mode of loading, the transition from pit to crack is also influenced by the pit shape, {{which in turn is}} affected by the microstructure of the corroding material. Thus, predicting the influence of microstructure on pit shape can assist in developing microstructures more resistant to stress corrosion cracking. This work presents numerical modeling of the stable pit growth based on direct incorporation of the actual microstructure in simulations. While many microstructural attributes can contribute towards corrosion, the current work focuses on the effects of the crystallographic orientation of the <b>grains</b> on <b>pit</b> growth through variation in corrosion potential with orientation. Two-dimensional simulation results show the strong influence of the crystallographic orientation on pit shapes and growth under the assumed 5 % and 10 % variation in corrosion potential, delineating the critical place of crystallographic orientation in pit growth to failure...|$|R
40|$|The Hadrianic Baths {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} archaeological sites in Leptis Magna- Libya. It was built at the command of Emperor Hadrian in the early 2 nd century CE; they represent some of the most lavish structures of Leptis Magna. It is unique in design and building technique. It was built of limestone, marble and brick. This paper mainly describes the deterioration of marble. The marble in the monuments can be classified into several types, based on its color, texture, chemical composition and the constituent mineral. The Hadrianic Baths is subjected to severe degradation, due to the climate, which is typically marine. This site suffered from different weathering forms, for example, disintegration of <b>grains,</b> <b>pitting,</b> chipping, frequent flaking, multiple-flaking, fissures and biodeterioration. These weathering forms were produced by many deterioration factors, such as moisture, salt weathering, biological and micro-biological factors, changes in temperature and wind erosion. The aim of this study is to characterize the building materials at the Hadrianic Baths, especially marble, and to evaluate the role of groundwater and sea weathering on the strength of the marble exposed to the coastline of the Mediterranean. Many samples were collected from limestone, marble, mortar, plaster and salts, for analysis and investigation. Several scientific techniques were used in the study of the morphology and texture. Those methods include microscopy, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), polarized light microscopy (PLM) and stereo microscopy. A qualitative identification of organic and inorganic chemical species was performed by using techniques such as energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and microbial investigation were also done. Our results indicated that the deterioration of marble was caused by the aggressive action of environmental agents. SEM observations indicated the occurrence of microcracks and particle aggregates in the samples. The study was also aimed to evaluate the efficiency of the various commercial silane-based and acrylic products in laboratory in order to recommend the protective treatment for the conservative treatment of the marble. To fulfill this goal a soaking characterization and accelerated ageing tests were performed. After artificial aging [included cycles of heating & cooling, salt weathering] proved that the [Rhdrosil or Tegvacon V] is the best material to consolidate the weakness of marble...|$|R

Consequently, the gold mineralogy of the soils is complex with residual and secondary gold grains exhibiting widely different textural and compositional characteristics. Residually enriched <b>grains</b> display <b>pitted,</b> rounded surfaces and have silver-depleted rims, while supergene gold grains are compositionally homogenous and have unpitted surfaces.

40|$|Weight loss, {{corrosion}} potential and EIS measurements {{were performed to}} understand the role of HCl in the pickling of oxidised 304 stainless steel in iron chloride-based electrolytes. The surface finish was analysed with SEM-EDX. The oxidised 304 stainless steel is active on immersion, resulting in a low {{corrosion potential}} and a high weight loss. After certain duration the stainless steel either remains active or becomes passive depending on HCl content. At low HCl contents, an ongoing active-to-passive transition results in localised corrosion at <b>pits,</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries and honeycombed recesses. The corrosion potential becomes high and the weight loss is suppressed. The weight loss decreases in the initial stage and rises on extended pickling with adding HCl. Because of anodic brightening, the 304 stainless steel is always active as HCl is concentrated. In contrast with the material that is passivated, the charge transfer resistance is considerably low and the double layer capacitance is large during that brightening. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It is concluded that a predominance of grain-rich samples is far more likely to be an indicator of the scale of production and consumption, than a means of distinguishing between the two.
