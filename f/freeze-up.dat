The newly overhauled BC Express pushed her back upstream through the Fort George Canyon and to the shipyard at Fort George. This would be the first time in the history of sternwheelers that one would push another upriver through a canyon.

25|$|The Dempster Highway {{provides}} {{access to}} Inuvik {{for the majority of}} the year. However, the highway relies on ferries and ice bridges to get across the rivers. It is thus closed during the time of <b>freeze-up</b> (roughly late-October to mid-December), for ice to form and allow ice bridges, and thaw (roughly mid-May to mid-June) to allow the ferry to run. At these times, there is air access only.|$|E
25|$|Lake <b>freeze-up</b> {{depends on}} the heat storage in the lake and {{therefore}} on its depth, the rate and temperature of any inflow, and water-air energy fluxes. Information on lake depth is often unavailable, although some indication of the depth of shallow lakes in the Arctic {{can be obtained from}} airborne radar imagery during late winter (Sellman et al. 1975) and spaceborne optical imagery during summer (Duguay and Lafleur 1997). The timing of breakup is modified by snow depth on the ice as well as by ice thickness and freshwater inflow.|$|E

40|$|Paleolimnological {{evidence}} from some Arctic lakes suggests that longer ice-free seasons have been experienced {{since the beginning}} of the nineteenth century. It has been inferred from some additional records that many Arctic lakes may have crossed an important ecological threshold as a result of recent warming. In the instrumental record, long-term trends exhibit increasingly later <b>freeze-ups</b> and earlier break-ups, closely corresponding to increasing air temperature trends, but with greater sensitivity at the more temperate latitudes. Broad spatial patterns in these trends are also related to major atmospheric circulation patterns. Future projections of lake ice indicate increasingly later <b>freeze-ups</b> and earlier break-ups, decreasing ice thickness, and changes in cover composition, particularly white-ice. For rivers, projected future decreases in south to north air-temperature gradients suggest that the severity of ice-jam flooding may be reduced but this could be mitigated by changes in the magnitude of spring snowmelt...|$|R
25|$|Echo Creek (occasionally {{known as}} Springbrook Creek) rises {{immediately}} {{to the north of}} Qu'Appelle and opens out into a broad coulee {{immediately to the}} south of the Qu'Appelle Valley. In the past it ran dry by late summer; global warming or other factors have caused it to run freely throughout the summer and to have fish swimming freely in it till the fall <b>freeze-up.</b> Beavers occasionally dam the creek in the spring using the poplars that line its coulee; at various points it opens up into ponds where in the past when the Qu'Appelle region was amply populated farm children swam.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the US Postal Service {{began using}} the British built Hoverwork AP1-88 to haul mail, freight, and {{passengers}} from Bethel, Alaska, {{to and from}} eight small villages along the Kuskokwim River. Bethel is {{far removed from the}} Alaska road system, thus making the hovercraft an attractive alternative to the air based delivery methods used prior to introduction of the hovercraft service. Hovercraft service is suspended for several weeks each year while the river is beginning to freeze to minimize damage to the river ice surface. The hovercraft is able to operate during the <b>freeze-up</b> period; however, this could potentially break the ice and create hazards for villagers using their snowmobiles along the river during the early winter.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Canadian Marine Drilling Ltd., a {{subsidiary}} of Dome Petroleum, brought a small armada to the Beaufort. It included three reinforced drillships and a support fleet of four supply boats, work and supply barges and a tugboat. This equipment expanded the explorable regions in the Beaufort Sea. Drillships, however, had their limitations for Beaufort work. Icebreakers {{and other forms of}} ice management could generally conquer the difficulties of the melting icecap in the summer. But after <b>freeze-up</b> began, the growing icecap would push the drill ship off location if it did not use icebreakers to keep the ice under control. CanMar's fleet eventually grew to include 5 drillships, the SSDC (Single Steel Drilling Caisson) and the Canmar Kigoriak, an Arctic Class 4 Icebreaker.|$|E

In this work, we propose a successive water-filling (SWaF) algorithm for the video transmission scheduling in P 2 P live streaming system, to minimize the playback <b>freeze-ups</b> among peers. SWaF algorithm only needs each peer to optimally transmit (within its uploading bandwidth) part of its available video segments in the buffer to other peers requiring the content and pass small amount message to some other peers.

This error was soon nicknamed the [...] "Red Ring of Death", echoing Windows' Blue Screen of Death error. Warning signs may include <b>freeze-ups,</b> graphical problems {{in the middle of}} gameplay, such as checkerboard or pinstripe patterns on the screen, and sound errors; mostly consisting of extremely loud noises that can be affected by the volume control, and the console only responds to pressing the power button to turn it off. These events may happen once or several times until the hardware failure occurs, or not at all. If the console freezes occasionally, the error will not necessarily follow. The technical problems seem to affect some generations of consoles more than others, e.g. Xenon or Zephyr. Those problems may also cause some freezing screens.|$|R

25|$|Ice {{forms on}} {{rivers and lakes}} in {{response}} to seasonal cooling. The sizes of the ice bodies involved {{are too small to}} exert other than localized climatic effects. However, the freeze-up/break-up processes respond to large-scale and local weather factors, such that considerable interannual variability exists in the dates of appearance and disappearance of the ice. Long series of lake-ice observations can serve as a proxy climate record, and the monitoring of <b>freeze-up</b> and break-up trends may provide a convenient integrated and seasonally specific index of climatic perturbations. Information on river-ice conditions is less useful as a climatic proxy because ice formation is strongly dependent on river-flow regime, which is affected by precipitation, snow melt, and watershed runoff as well as being subject to human interference that directly modifies channel flow, or that indirectly affects the runoff via land-use practices.|$|E
500|$|The Earps {{may have}} spent the winter in Wrangell before setting out for Dawson in the spring on board the Governor Pingree, {{but by the time}} they reached Rampart on the Yukon River, <b>freeze-up</b> has set in. The Earps rented a cabin from Rex Beach for $100 a month and spent the winter of 1898–1899 there. He managed a small store during the spring of 1899 in St. Michael on the Norton Sound, a major gateway to the Alaskan {{interior}} via the Yukon River. By this time, he decided the rush to stake a claim in the Klondike was over. Earp headed for Nome, Alaska, instead. In September, Earp and partner Charles E. Hoxie built the Dexter Saloon in Nome, the city's first two-story wooden building and its largest and most luxurious saloon. The second floor had 12 [...] "clubrooms" [...] upstairs decorated with fine mirrors, thick carpets, draperies, and sideboards. The building was used for a variety of purposes because it was so large: [...] with [...] ceilings. Earp used the club rooms upstairs as a brothel, another fact that Josephine worked hard to see was omitted from stories about him.|$|E
40|$|Research was {{performed}} to clarify {{the changes in the}} ice-cover ratio on a river, based on an ice cover surveys conducted in the 1981 / 82 winter at four observation points in Kitami City. The ice cover was categorized according to the maximum ice-cover ratio defined as the maximum percent of river width covered with ice, the cumulative numbers of <b>freeze-ups</b> and break-ups, and the completely ice covered period as a share of the observation period. To estimate the ice-cover ratio, multiple regression equations were obtained that use meteorological elements and water levels. It was found that daily average temperature and degree-days of frost had the most significant effect on the ice-cover ratio. Changes in the total heat balance of river water were also clarified from the measured heat balance. Several multiple regression models for the total heat balance were developed. Using the estimated total heat loss and surface flow velocity as parameters, a diagram was produced to show the relationship between the ice cover condition and the two parameters...|$|R
40|$|Winter roads have {{connected}} isolated northern {{communities for}} over 50 years. Originally, winter roads were constructed by private contractors. Since 1979, the Department of Transportation has been overseeing {{the construction and}} maintenance of winter roads through contracts with Indian Bands and other local groups. The winter road network in Manitoba spans a length of 2178 km and services 30 communities (approximately 29000 people). It is extremely important for the shipment of goods, employment of locals and travel between communities. With the certainty of climate change and expected temperature increases of 4 - 6 °C {{by the end of}} this century, there is a real threat to the seasonal operation of winter roads. The inevitable climate change from greenhouse gas emissions will result in later <b>freeze-ups,</b> earlier spring melts and more frost-free days. The implications of this climate change would be detrimental to the winter road network. An example of these implications was the airlifts required in 1998 to transport essential supplies to several communities as a result of drastic changes in the climate predominately due to El Nino. This shortened the winter road season and didn’t allow some of the routes to be constructed at all...|$|R
40|$|The Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) {{streaming}} {{has shown}} {{as an effective}} solution for wireline video applications, while for the wireless video streaming applications, the limited radio resource and battery energy are the main constraints on the way of P 2 P applications.

The problem we try to solve is how to utilize P 2 P schemes in video streaming and schedule the video transmission among peers to minimize the "freeze-ups" in playback caused by buffer underflow. In this work, we propose energy-efficient algorithm for the video transmission scheduling in wireless P 2 P live streaming system, to minimize the playback <b>freeze-ups</b> among peers. Further the algorithm is extended to two scenarios: peers' reluctance of consuming battery energy and allowing overhearing, with alternative energy-efficient algorithms proposed for the second scenario.

500|$|Many {{marine mammals}} {{seasonally}} migrate. Annual ice contains areas {{of water that}} appear and disappear throughout the year as the weather changes, and seals migrate {{in response to these}} changes. In turn, polar bears must follow their prey. In Hudson Bay, James Bay, and some other areas, the ice melts completely each summer (an event often referred to as [...] "ice-floe breakup"), forcing polar bears to go onto land and wait through the months until the next <b>freeze-up.</b> In the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, polar bears retreat each summer to the ice further north that remains frozen year-round. Seals may also migrate to other environmental changes, such as El Niño, and traveling seals may use various features of their environment to reach their destination including geomagnetic fields, water and wind currents, the position of the sun and moon and the taste and temperature of the water. Baleen whales famously migrate very long distances into tropical waters to give birth and raise young, possibly to prevent predation by killer whales. The gray whale has the longest recorded migration of any mammal, with one traveling [...] from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Baja Peninsula. During the winter, manatees living at the northern end of their range migrate to warmer waters.|$|E
60|$|Everywhere {{men were}} at work, and at work desperately, for the closing down of winter was so {{imminent}} {{that it was}} a gamble whether or not they would get across the great chain of lakes before the <b>freeze-up.</b> Yet, when Kit arrived at the tent of Messrs. Sprague and Stine, he did not find them stirring.|$|E
60|$|The {{next moment}} they were {{scrambling}} wildly {{out of the}} way of the hurtling bodies of those that followed. At the time of the <b>freeze-up,</b> a jam had occurred at this point, and cakes of ice were up-ended in snow-covered confusion. After several hard falls, Smoke drew out his candle and lighted it. Those in the rear hailed it with acclaim. In the windless air it burned easily, and he led the way more quickly.|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{impacting}} terrestrial ecosystems world-wide and the Arctic is particularly vulnerable {{as it is}} warming faster and with greater magnitude than other regions. Understanding the responses of arctic plants species to abiotic factors is crucial to predicting the impact climate change {{will have on the}} Arctic because plants play critical roles in carbon exchange, energy balance, and trophic interactions. Using data from long-term research sites in Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska, the purpose of this thesis was to investigate how arctic plants respond to 17 - 19 years of experimental warming, establish the relative strengths of various abiotic factors in predicting the response of plant traits over time, and examine evidence that climate change will significantly affect plants as the region continues to warm. Plants typically responded to longterm experimental warming with increased inflorescence heights, increased leaf lengths, and accelerated reproductive phenologies, while reproductive efforts responded less consistently. Further analysis revealed that responses to experimental warming tended to dampen during warmer years. Though mostly non-significant, several abiotic factors showed trends over time consistent with regional warming patterns observed in the Barrow area including increasing air and soil temperatures, earlier snowmelts, delayed <b>freeze-ups,</b> drier soils, and increasing thaw depths. Several plant species showed significant trends toward increasing inflorescence heights and reproductive efforts over the same time period. Of the abiotic factors examined, air and soil temperatures yielded the greatest predictive capabilities as these factors were consistently correlated with the greatest number of traits across sites. Unlike other traits, the reproductive efforts of many species were best predicted using temperatures during the year prior to flower burst. When we compared experimental warming responses with trends in abiotic factors and traits over time we found strong evidence that climate change will likely cause significant shifts 5 in the growth and reproductive efforts of at least seven plant species at these sites. This study illustrates the value of long-term monitoring coupled with experimentation and lays the groundwork for future studies examining the ecosystem consequences of climate change on the Barrow region...|$|R
60|$|But Rasmunsen {{was clean}} grit, and at fifty cents found takers, who, two days later, set his eggs down intact at Linderman. But fifty {{cents a pound}} is a {{thousand}} dollars a ton, and his fifteen hundred pounds had exhausted his emergency fund and left him stranded at the Tantalus point where each day he saw the fresh-whipsawed boats departing for Dawson. Further, a great anxiety brooded over the camp where the boats were built. Men worked frantically, early and late, {{at the height of}} their endurance, caulking, nailing, and pitching in a frenzy of haste for which adequate explanation was not far to seek. Each day the snow-line crept farther down the bleak, rock-shouldered peaks, and gale followed gale, with sleet and slush and snow, and in the eddies and quiet places young ice formed and thickened through the fleeting hours. And each morn, toil- stiffened men turned wan faces across the lake to see if the <b>freeze-up</b> had come. For the <b>freeze-up</b> heralded the death of their hope--the hope that they would be floating down the swift river ere navigation closed on the chain of lakes.|$|E
60|$|In the morning, as usual, {{they were}} among the last of the boats to start. Breck, despite his boating inefficiency, and with only his wife and nephew for crew, had broken camp, loaded his boat, and pulled out at the first streak of day. But there was no hurrying Stine and Sprague, who seemed {{incapable}} of realizing that the <b>freeze-up</b> might come at any time. They malingered, got in the way, delayed, and doubled the work of Kit and Shorty.|$|E
60|$|Each day {{for three}} days, beaten to helplessness, they turned tail {{on the battle}} and ran back into the {{sheltering}} river. By the fourth day, the hundred boats had increased to three hundred, and the two thousand argonauts on board knew that the great gale heralded the <b>freeze-up</b> of Le Barge. Beyond, the rapid rivers would continue to run for days, but unless they got beyond, and immediately, they were doomed to be frozen in for six months to come.|$|E

'Don't do it,' says I, when he ups with his rifle. 'You only got that one shot, an' it's too dark to see the sights.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right, Shorty," [...] replied Smoke. [...] "I'll {{make the}} round trip {{and be back}} in Dawson in six weeks. The Yukon trail is packed, and the first hundred miles {{or so of the}} Stewart ought to be packed. Old-timers from Henderson have told me a number of outfits went up last fall after the <b>freeze-up.</b> When I strike their trail I ought to hit her up forty or fifty miles a day.

60|$|Into {{the north}} they fought their way, {{although}} old-timers, coming out, {{shook their heads}} and prophesied they would be frozen in on the lakes. That the <b>freeze-up</b> might come any day was patent, and delays of safety were no longer considered. For this reason, Liverpool decided to shoot the rapid stream connecting Linderman to Lake Bennett with the fully loaded boat. It was the custom to line the empty boats down and to portage the cargoes across. Even then many empty boats had been wrecked. But the time was past for such precaution.|$|E
6000|$|All nodded. [...] "Well, then, I got a proposition, boys. You {{can take}} it or leave it, but just listen kindly to it.

If I do the cookin' for you, you all'll get on that much faster. Also, the cookin' 'll be better, and that'll make you pack better. And I can pack quite a bit myself in between times, quite a bit, yes, sir, quite a bit." ...|$|E
60|$|He lay on {{the sled}} at full length, face-down, holding on with both hands. Whenever the dogs slacked from topmost speed he rose to his knees, and, yelling and urging, {{clinging}} precariously with one hand, threw his whip into them. Poor team that it was, he passed two sleds before White River was reached. Here, at the <b>freeze-up,</b> a jam had piled a barrier, allowing the open water, that formed for half a mile below, to freeze smoothly. This smooth stretch enabled the racers to make flying exchanges of sleds, and down all the course they had placed their relays below the jams.|$|E
60|$|Here {{for a day}} he camped with Carmack, a squaw-man, and his Indian brother-in-law, Skookum Jim, {{bought a}} boat, and, with his dogs on board, drifted down the Yukon to Forty Mile. August was drawing to a close, the days were growing shorter, and winter was coming on. Still with {{unbounded}} faith in his hunch that a strike was coming in the Upper Country, his plan was to get together a party of four or five, and, if that was impossible, at least a partner, and to pole back up the river before the <b>freeze-up</b> to do winter prospecting. But the men of Forty Mile were without faith. The diggings to the westward were good enough for them.|$|E
60|$|At the end {{of three}} hours, Sprague pulled his oar in and said they would run back {{into the mouth of}} the river for shelter. Stine {{seconded}} him, and the several hard-won miles were lost. A second day, and a third, the same fruitless attempt was made. In the river mouth, the continually arriving boats from White Horse made a flotilla of over two hundred. Each day forty or fifty arrived, and only two or three won to the northwest shore of the lake and did not come back. Ice was now forming in the eddies, and connecting from eddy to eddy in thin lines around the points. The <b>freeze-up</b> was very imminent.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the weather}} grows cold, and a <b>freeze-up</b> covers all his feeding grounds. Under his {{beautiful}} feathers the bones project {{to spoil the}} contour of his round plump body. He is famished now; he watches the gulls {{to see what they}} eat. When he finds out, he forgets his caution, and roams about after stray mussels on the beach. In the spring hunger drives him into the ponds where food is plenty--but such food! In a week his flesh is so strong that a crow would hardly eat it. Altogether, it is small wonder that as soon as his instinct tells him the streams of the North are open and the trout running up, he is off to a land of happier memories.|$|E
60|$|The <b>freeze-up</b> came on {{when we were}} at {{the mouth}} of Henderson Creek, and we traded him off for two sacks of flour to an outfit that was bound up White River after copper. Now that whole outfit was lost. Never trace nor hide nor hair of men, dogs, sleds, or {{anything}} was ever found. They dropped clean out of sight. It became one of the mysteries of the country. Steve and I plugged away up the Stewart, and six weeks afterward that Spot crawled into camp. He was a perambulating skeleton, and could just drag along; but he got there. And what I want to know is who told him we were up the Stewart? We could have gone a thousand other places. How did he know? You tell me, and I'll tell you.|$|E
60|$|But of this Rasmunsen knew nothing. The {{day after}} the wreck he patched up the Alma and pulled out.

According to the custom of the country, he was driven ashore at Windy Arm; three times on Tagish saw him swamped and beached; and Lake Marsh held him at the <b>freeze-up.</b> The Alma was crushed in the jamming of the floes, but the eggs were intact. These he back-tripped two miles across the ice to the shore, where he built a cache, which stood for years after and was pointed out by men who knew.|$|E
60|$|What {{took them}} ten minutes by river, took Charles {{half an hour}} by land, and while they waited {{for him at the}} head of Lake Bennett they passed the time of day with several {{dilapidated}} old-timers on their way out. The famine news was graver than ever. The North- west Mounted Police, stationed at the foot of Lake Marsh where the gold-rushers entered Canadian territory, were refusing to let a man past who did not carry with him seven hundred pounds of grub. In Dawson City a thousand men, with dog-teams, were waiting the <b>freeze-up</b> to come out over the ice. The trading companies could not fill their grub-contracts, and partners were cutting the cards to see which should go and which should stay and work the claims.|$|E
