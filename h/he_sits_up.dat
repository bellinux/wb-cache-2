25|$|Max {{escapes from}} the JLI using an escape pod. Failing to capture Max, the JLI carried Jaime {{on the land}} surface where paramedics Rocket Red and Skeets try to {{resuscitate}} him. However their efforts fail as Jaime had already died. As the team deals with his loss, suddenly <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up,</b> healed, declaring he knows Max's ultimate plans {{and that they can}} stop him. Jaime reveals to them that his healing scarab armor is what protected him from the blaster. When the battle against the OMAC Prime goes nowhere, Blue Beetle attacks and OMAC Prime appears to take his power, but Blue Beetle mentions that it cannot take control with the Scarab's power. Blue Beetle attacks and blasts OMAC Prime.|$|E
60|$|You cannot {{imagine how}} pretty he is. His back {{has the most}} {{beautiful}} smooth shining stripes of reddish brown and black, his eyes shine like bright glass beads, and <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> jauntily on his hind quarters, with his little tail thrown over his back like a ruffle.|$|E
6000|$|... "That will tickle him immensely; and if you'd {{just let}} him put brown tops to my old boots, and stick a cockade in his hat when <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> behind the phaeton, he'd be a happy fellow," [...] laughed Thorny, who had {{discovered}} that one of Ben's ambitions {{was to be a}} tip-top groom.|$|E
6000|$|Will he {{kiss your}} hand {{when it is}} {{wrinkled}} and old? Will he call you pretty names when the baby is crying in the night, and you cannot keep it quiet--or, better still, will <b>he</b> <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> and take a turn with it? Will his arm be strong around you {{in the days of}} trouble? Will his eyes shine above you full of tenderness when yours are growing dim? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{the tree}} off!" [...] Such {{were the first}} words Captain Moore uttered when he {{returned}} to consciousness. It was some time before <b>he</b> could <b>sit</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|The botanist's face clouds. <b>He</b> rolls over, <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> {{abruptly}} {{and puts his}} lean hands about his knees.|$|R
60|$|It has {{not looked}} very long, when <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up,</b> chilled and shaking, slowly recovers {{consciousness}} {{of where he}} is, and makes himself ready to depart. The woman receives what he pays her with a grateful, ‘Bless ye, bless ye, deary!’ and seems, tired out, to begin making herself ready for sleep as he leaves the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then he's {{as good as}} gold," [...] {{said the}} little creature--Oh, in such a motherly, womanly way! [...] "And when Emma's tired, he puts her to bed. And when he's tired he goes to bed himself. And when I come home and light the candle and {{has a bit of}} supper, <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> again and has it with me. Don't you, Tom?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{we come to}} the handsomest {{member of}} the family, Longfoot the Kangaroo Rat, so called because of his long hind legs and tail {{and the way in which}} <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> and jumps. Really he is not a member of the Rat branch of the family, but closely related to the Pocket Mice. You see, he has pockets in his cheeks." ...|$|E
60|$|Nobody {{answered}} him, and now <b>he</b> essayed to <b>sit</b> <b>up.</b> <b>He</b> {{could not}} budge and consequently began to struggle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! who know, Major? Mind of man {{very strange}} and various thing; p'raps he no bear {{to see you}} and Miss Barbara together; p'raps he bolt coast, get ear of local {{magistrate}} before you; p'raps <b>he</b> <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> tree to shoot you; p'raps nasty temper make him mad. But he gone any way, and I hope he no meet Asiki, poor fellow, 'cause if so, who know? P'raps they knock him on head, or if they think him you, they make him prisoner and keep him quite long while before they let him go again." ...|$|R
60|$|He used {{to teach}} himself tricks, and go {{from room to room}} in the evening, {{performing}} them, and when he had completed his programme <b>he</b> would <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> and beg. All the fellows used to humour him. He must have made pounds {{in the course of the}} year.|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> or jumps {{he looks}} like a tiny Kangaroo. But that doesn't mean {{anything}} to you, and you are no wiser than before, for you never have seen a Kangaroo," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "In the first place he {{is about the size of}} Striped Chipmunk. That is, his body is about the size of Striped Chipmunk's; but his tail is longer than his head and body together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} what's wrong,' said the man. 'To start with, you can't {{get at the}} dog to fix him except by day, when they let him out. At night he's shut up inside the house. And suppose you do fix him during the day what happens then? Either the bloke gets another before night, or else <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> all night with a gun. It isn't like as if these blokes was {{ordinary}} blokes. They're down here {{to look after the}} house. That's their job, and they don't take any chances.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Under my uncle's hat? My uncle is a martyr, Foker, my boy. My uncle {{has been}} doing excruciating duties all night. He likes {{to go to bed}} rather early. He has a dreadful {{headache}} if <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> and touches supper. He always has the gout if he walks or stands much at a ball. He has been sitting up, and standing up, and supping. He has gone home to the gout and the headache, and for my sake. Shall I make fun of the old boy? no, not for Venice!" ...|$|E
60|$|Hendricks {{opened his}} eyes slowly. His body ached all over. <b>He</b> tried to <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> but needles of pain shot through his arm and shoulder. He gasped.|$|R
60|$|Dick was {{so tired}} <b>he</b> could {{scarcely}} <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> in the saddle. But he longed to see Sam rescued, and so rode along as best he could.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing ’ll ’urt ’im now" [...] {{whispered the}} widow, {{sniffing}} as she struck another match. [...] "Oh! if <b>he</b> could only <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> ’and speak to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{about as}} much as Johnny Chuck can," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "Sometimes he climbs up in low bushes or in small, low-branching trees to cut off tender shoots, but he doesn't do much of this sort of thing. His home is the ground. He is most active at night, but where undisturbed, is out more or less during the day. When he wants to cut off a twig <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> like a Squirrel and holds the twig in his hands while he bites it off with his sharp teeth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. He is single-mindedness itself. He gives away {{nearly all}} he has to the poor. He works among the sick, {{carrying}} them necessaries with his own hands. He teaches the ignorant men and lads of the village when he ought to be resting at home, till he is absolutely prostrate from exhaustion, and then <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> at night writing encouraging letters to those poor people who formerly belonged to his congregation in the village, and have now gone away. He always offends ladies, because he can't help speaking the truth as he believes it; but he hasn't offended me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{must tell}} you, then, {{as one of}} the first remarks on matters and things here in England, that [...] "robin redbreast" [...] is not at all the fellow we in America take him to be. The {{character}} who flourishes under that name among us is quite a different bird; he is twice as large, and has altogether a different air, and as <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> with military erectness on a rail fence or stump, shows not even a family likeness to his diminutive English namesake. Well, of course, robin over here will claim to have the real family estate and title, since he lives in a country where such matters are understood and looked into. Our robin is probably some fourth cousin, who, like others, has struck out a new course for himself in America, and thrives upon it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing 'll 'urt 'im now," [...] {{whispered the}} widow, {{sniffing}} as she struck another match. [...] "Oh! if <b>he</b> could only <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> {{and speak to}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{convalescence}} <b>he</b> would <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> in bed, see the fluffy horses feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay on the trodden yellow snow; {{watch the}} miners troop home--small, black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field. Then the night {{came up in}} dark blue vapour from the snow.|$|R
60|$|Little {{by little}} Whitefoot {{recovered}} his strength. At last <b>he</b> could <b>sit</b> <b>up,</b> and finally <b>he</b> {{began to move}} about a little, although he was still wobbly on his legs. Farmer Brown's boy put some bits of food where Whitefoot could get them, and as he ate, Whitefoot's beautiful soft eyes were filled with gratitude.|$|R
60|$|On his {{journeys}} {{through the}} woods Tookhees never forgets the dangerous possibilities. His progress {{is a series of}} jerks, and whisks, and jumps, and hidings. He leaves his doorway, after much watching, and shoots like a minnow across the moss to an upturned root. There <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> and listens, rubbing his whiskers nervously. Then he glides along the root for a couple of feet, drops to the ground and disappears. He is hiding there under a dead leaf. A moment of stillness and he jumps like a jack-in-abox. Now he is sitting on the leaf that covered him, rubbing his whiskers again, looking back over his trail as if he heard footsteps behind him. Then another nervous dash, a squeak which proclaims at once his escape, and his arrival, and he vanishes under the old moss-grown log where his fellows live, a whole colony of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{little fellow}} is {{a lover of}} the Green Forest, and he is quite as active by day as by night. He is pretty, {{especially}} when <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> to eat, holding his food in his paws as does Happy Jack Squirrel. He makes his home in a burrow, the entrance to which is under an old stump, a rock or the root of a tree. His nest is of soft grass or moss. Sometimes he makes it in a hollow log or stump instead of digging a bedroom under ground. He is thrifty and lays up a supply of food in underground rooms, hollow logs and similar places. He eats seeds, small fruits, roots and various plants. Because of his preference for the Green Forest {{and the fact that}} he lives as a rule far from the homes of men, he does little real damage.|$|E
60|$|The life of {{the poet}} is, not unnaturally, one long warfare with his dons. He cannot conform himself to pedantic rules, which demand his return to college before midnight. Though often the {{possessor}} of a sweet vein of clerical and Kebleian verse, the poet does not willingly attend chapel; for indeed, as <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> all night, it is cruel to expect him to arise before noon. About the poet's late habits a story is told, which seems authentic. A remarkable and famous contemporary singer was known to his fellow-undergraduates only by this circumstance, that his melodious voice was heard declaiming anapaests all through the ambrosial night. When {{the voice of the}} singer was lulled, three sharp taps were heard in the silence. This noise was produced by the bard's Scotch friend and critic in knocking the ashes out of his pipe. These feasts of reason are almost incompatible with the early devotion which, strangely enough, Shelley found time and inclination to attend.|$|E
60|$|They {{waited a}} long time, for the private was {{in no hurry to}} become an {{ornament}} and made his guesses very slowly. The Nome King, who seemed to know, by some magical power, all that took place in his beautiful rooms of his palace, grew impatient finally and declared <b>he</b> would <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> no longer.|$|R
60|$|Softly crooning {{to himself}} in his sorrow and loneliness, Nod lay long awake. Of a sudden <b>he</b> would <b>sit</b> <b>up,</b> trembling, to glance {{as if from a}} dream about him, then in a little while would lie down quiet again. At last, with hands over his face and feet curled up towards the fire, he fell fast asleep.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after he}} had begun to go to school his father died, and when he was fifteen the {{children}} lost their mother too. Keats was passionately devoted to his mother; during her last illness <b>he</b> would <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> all night with her, give her her medicine, and even cook her food himself. At her death he was brokenhearted.|$|R
60|$|It {{is a most}} {{interesting}} sight when it comes at last, and well repays the watching. The water is pouring through a five-foot break in the dam; {{the roof of a}} house is in ruins. You have rubbed yourself all over with fir boughs, to destroy some of the scent in your clothes, and hidden yourself in the top of a fallen tree. The twilight goes; the moon wheels over the eastern spruces, flooding the river with silver light. Still no sign of life. You are beginning to think of another disappointment; to think your toes cannot stand the cold another minute without stamping, which would spoil everything, when a ripple shoots swiftly across the pool, and a big beaver comes out on the bank. <b>He</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> a moment, looking, listening; then goes to the broken house and sits up again, looking it all over, estimating damages, making plans. There is a commotion in the water; three others join him--you are warm now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh punk. I don't see what's {{the use of}} law-school--or even {{finishing}} high school. I don't want to go {{to college}} 'specially. Honest, there's lot of fellows that have graduated from colleges that don't begin to make as much money as fellows that went to work early. Old Shimmy Peters, that teaches Latin in the High, he's a what-is-it from Columbia and <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> all night reading a lot of greasy books and he's always spieling about the 'value of languages,' and the poor soak doesn't make but eighteen hundred a year, and no traveling salesman would think of working for that. I know what I'd like to do. I'd like to be an aviator, or own a corking big garage, or else--a fellow was telling me about it yesterday--I'd like to be one of these fellows that the Standard Oil Company sends out to China, and you live in a compound and don't have to do any work, and you get to see the world and pagodas and the ocean and everything! And then I could take up correspondence-courses. That's the real stuff! You don't have to recite to some frosty-faced old dame that's trying to show off to the principal, and you can study any subject you want to. Just listen to these! I clipped out the ads of some swell courses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Happy Jack is {{more than}} twice as big as I, but at that, I'm not afraid of him," [...] said Chatterer and glared at Happy Jack. [...] "He is gray all over, except underneath, where he is white. He has a tremendously big tail and is so proud of it he shows it off {{whenever}} he has a chance. When <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> he has a way of folding his hands on his breast. I don't know what he does it for unless it is to keep them warm in cold weather. He builds a nest very much like mine. Sometimes it is in a hollow tree, but quite as often it is in the branches of a tree. He is a good traveler in the tree-tops, but he spends a good deal of his time on the ground. He likes open woodland best, especially where there are many nut trees. He has a storehouse where he stores up nuts for winter, but he buries in the ground and under the leaves more than he puts in his storehouse. In winter, when he is hungry, he hunts for those buried nuts, and somehow he manages to find them even when they are covered with snow. When he comes to stealing he is not better than I am. I have seen him steal birds' eggs, and I wouldn't trust him unwatched around one of my storehouses." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{they reached}} the patch of tender, sweet, young clover, Johnny Chuck would <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> very {{straight}} and still, watching as sharp as he knew how for the least sign of danger. When the three little stomachs were full of sweet, tender, young clover, he would proudly lead the way home again, and then as before <b>he</b> would <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> very straight and watch for danger, while the three baby Chucks sprawledout on the doorstep for a sun-nap.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} {{was having a hard}} time of it. He was going it blindly, and was so faint from want of sleep and {{something}} to eat that <b>he</b> could hardly <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> in the saddle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is the child?" [...] he asked, {{surprised}} at the penetrating chilliness {{of the air and}} the unwonted dimness of the lamp by which <b>he</b> used to <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> half the night with the open Bible before him.|$|R
