5|$|After his death, {{a legend}} arose {{that he had}} not <b>died,</b> <b>that</b> his funeral was staged, and that he had escaped to Hawaii, married a native woman, and fathered several {{children}} with her. Andrew Forest Muir, writing in 1956 in the Filson Club History Quarterly, debunked this legend. He documented that the first Deshas in Hawaii did not arrive until nearly two decades after Isaac Desha's death. At the time of Baker's murder, the progenitor of the Hawaiian Desha family had been four years old. That progenitor was John R. Langherne Desha, a grandson of Governor Joseph Desha and nephew of Isaac Desha. In Honolulu, he helped establish Queen's Hospital and worked there until his death.|$|E

5|$|Anderson's efforts helped spark renewed {{interest}} in the trail, and Avery (who led the charge after Perkins’ death in 1932) {{was able to bring}} other states on board.

He and MacKaye clashed over the ATC's response to a major commercial development along the trail's path; MacKaye left the organization, while Avery was willing to simply reroute the trail. Avery reigned as Chairman of the ATC from 1932 to 1952 (he <b>died</b> <b>that</b> same year).|$|E

Liszt was Smetana's principal teacher throughout the latter's creative life, and at this time was crucially able to revive his spirits and rescue him from the relative artistic isolation of Gothenburg.|$|E
