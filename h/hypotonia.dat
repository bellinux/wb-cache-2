5|$|Midazolam, {{when taken}} during the third {{trimester}} of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including <b>hypotonia,</b> apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of <b>hypotonia</b> and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth. Other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from <b>hypotonia,</b> hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E
25|$|Paternal {{inheritance}} of a deletion {{of this region}} is associated with Prader-Willi syndrome (characterised by <b>hypotonia,</b> obesity, and hypogonadism).|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypotonia</b> {{and motor}} {{difficulties}} often impact handwriting. Accommodations for lessening handwriting demands will improve performance and save long-term hand function.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{conditions}} include frequent ear infection, hearing loss, <b>hypotonia,</b> developmental problems, respiratory problems, eating difficulties, light sensitivity, and esophageal reflux.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of an overdose such as sleepiness, agitation and ataxia occur much more frequently and severely in children. <b>Hypotonia</b> may also occur in severe cases.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 study {{concluded}} that Peek probably had FG syndrome, a rare X chromosome–linked genetic syndrome that causes physical anomalies such as <b>hypotonia</b> (low muscle tone) and macrocephaly (abnormally large head).|$|E
25|$|The {{prognosis}} {{for individuals with}} severe LNS is poor. Death is usually due to renal failure or complications from <b>hypotonia,</b> in {{the first or second}} decade of life. Less severe forms have better prognoses.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of CNM include severe <b>hypotonia,</b> hypoxia-requiring {{breathing}} assistance, and scaphocephaly. Among centronuclear myopathies, the X-linked myotubular myopathy form typically presents at birth, {{and is thus}} {{considered a}} congenital myopathy. However, some centronuclear myopathies may present later in life.|$|E
25|$|Affected {{children}} may show red cheeks, nose and lips, loss of hair, teeth, and nails, transient rashes, <b>hypotonia</b> (muscle weakness), and increased sensitivity to light. Other symptoms may include kidney dysfunction (e.g. Fanconi syndrome) or neuropsychiatric {{symptoms such as}} emotional lability, memory impairment, or insomnia.|$|E
25|$|The periods {{before and}} {{surrounding}} birth are typically normal in individuals with LNS. The most common presenting features are abnormally decreased muscle tone (<b>hypotonia)</b> and developmental delay, which are evident by {{three to six}} months of age. Affected individuals are late in sitting up, while most never crawl or walk. Lack of speech is also a very common trait associated with LNS.|$|E
25|$|Inherited {{metabolic}} disorders {{characterized by}} deficient activities of biotin-dependent carboxylases are termed multiple carboxylase deficiency. These include {{deficiencies in the}} enzymes holocarboxylase synthetase or biotinidase. Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency prevents the body's cells from using biotin effectively, and thus interferes with multiple carboxylase reactions. Biochemical and clinical manifestations include: ketolactic acidosis, organic aciduria, hyperammonemia, skin rash, feeding problems, <b>hypotonia,</b> seizures, developmental delay, alopecia, and coma.|$|E
25|$|Vigabatrin is {{also used}} to treat {{seizures}} in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD), which is an inborn GABA metabolism defect that causes intellectual disability, <b>hypotonia,</b> seizures, speech disturbance, and ataxia through the accumulation of γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). Vigabatrin helps lower GHB levels through GABA transaminase inhibition. However, this is in the brain only; it has no effect on peripheral GABA transaminase, so the GHB keeps building up and eventually reaches the brain.|$|E
25|$|Oxazepam {{when taken}} during late in pregnancy, the third trimester, causes a {{definite}} {{risk to the}} neonate including a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome including <b>hypotonia,</b> and reluctance to suck, to apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Floppy infant syndrome and sedation in the newborn may also occur. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam is {{sometimes}} tried to treat epilepsy when other medications fail. It {{has been found}} to be more effective than clonazepam in the treatment of West syndrome, which is an age-dependent epilepsy, affecting the very young. In uncontrolled studies, nitrazepam has shown effectiveness in infantile spasms and {{is sometimes}} considered when other anti-seizure drugs have failed. However, drowsiness, <b>hypotonia,</b> and most significantly tolerance to anti-seizure effects typically develop with long term treatment, generally limiting Nitrazepam to acute seizure management.|$|E
25|$|The condition, whether {{resulting}} from cerebellar malformation or injury, results in incomplete cerebral development and no {{two people are}} affected in the same way. In general, cerebral palsy is a physical impairment that affects posture {{and the development of}} movement. Ataxic cerebral palsy in particular, is manifested in the performance of movements with abnormal force, rhythm, and accuracy. Patients have <b>hypotonia</b> (decreased muscle tone), signs of ataxia (loss of full control of bodily movement), impaired balance and coordination, intention tremors, and a wide-based gait (in walking patients).|$|E
25|$|There is {{some medical}} {{evidence}} of various malformations, e.g., cardiac or facial deformations {{when used in}} early pregnancy; however, the data is not conclusive. The data are also inconclusive on whether benzodiazepines such as clonazepam cause developmental deficits or decreases in IQ in the developing fetus when taken by the mother during pregnancy. Clonazepam, when used late in pregnancy, may result {{in the development of}} a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines in the neonate may include <b>hypotonia,</b> apnoeic spells, cyanosis and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines are {{lipophilic}} {{and rapidly}} penetrate membranes, so rapidly penetrate the placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam in late pregnancy in especially high doses {{may result in}} floppy infant syndrome. Use in the third trimester of pregnancy may result {{in the development of}} a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines in the neonate may include <b>hypotonia,</b> and reluctance to suckle, to apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. These symptoms may persist for hours or months after birth.|$|E
25|$|FHI is {{characterized}} by hypoglycemia that ranges from severe neonatal-onset, difficult-to-manage disease to childhood-onset disease with mild symptoms and difficult-to-diagnose hypoglycemia. Neonatal-onset disease manifests within hours to two days after birth. Childhood-onset disease manifests during the first months or years of life. In the newborn period, presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, including seizures, <b>hypotonia,</b> poor feeding, and apnea. In severe cases, serum glucose concentrations are typically extremely low and thus easily recognized, whereas in milder cases, variable and mild hypoglycemia may make the diagnosis more difficult. Even within the same family, disease manifestations can range from mild to severe.|$|E
25|$|The {{committee}} {{recommended that}} all benzodiazepine treatment be withdrawn gradually and recommended that benzodiazepine treatment {{be used only}} in carefully selected patients and that therapy be limited to short-term use only. It was noted in the review that alcohol can potentiate the central nervous system-depressant effects of benzodiazepines and should be avoided. The central nervous system-depressant effects of benzodiazepines may make driving or operating machinery dangerous, and the elderly {{are more prone to}} these adverse effects. High single doses or repeated low doses have been reported to produce <b>hypotonia,</b> poor sucking, and hypothermia in the neonate, and irregularities in the fetal heart. The committee recommended that benzodiazepines be avoided in lactation.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral {{development}} normally {{occurs in}} the first two years of life when the infant is acquiring new motor and adaptive skills, consequently signs and symptoms of ataxic cerebral palsy begin to manifest during this time period. Typically patients fail to reach motor milestones and show a qualitative difference in motor development. During the neonatal period (first 28 days of life), children are noted to be lethargic, relatively immobile, and floppy. Moreover, <b>hypotonia</b> is greatest during this period, even though muscle tone increases with age, it never reaches normal levels. The limbs show weakness, incoordination in voluntary movement, dysdiadochokinesis (in inability to perform rapidly alternating movements), and titubation.|$|E
25|$|Spastic {{cerebral}} palsy, or {{cerebral palsy}} where spasticity (muscle tightness) is the exclusive or almost exclusive impairment present, {{is by far}} the most common type of overall cerebral palsy, occurring in upwards of 70% of all cases. People with this type of CP are hypertonic and have what is essentially a neuromuscular mobility impairment (rather than <b>hypotonia</b> or paralysis) stemming from an upper motor neuron lesion in the brain as well as the corticospinal tract or the motor cortex. This damage impairs the ability of some nerve receptors in the spine to receive gamma-Aminobutyric acid properly, leading to hypertonia in the muscles signaled by those damaged nerves.|$|E
25|$|Athetoid {{cerebral}} palsy or dyskinetic {{cerebral palsy}} (sometimes abbreviated ADCP) {{is a type}} of cerebral palsy primarily associated with damage, like other forms of CP, to the basal ganglia in the form of lesions that occur during brain development due to bilirubin encephalopathy and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Unlike spastic or ataxic cerebral palsies, ADCP is characterized by both hypertonia and <b>hypotonia,</b> due to the affected individual's inability to control muscle tone. Clinical diagnosis of ADCP typically occurs within 18 months of birth and is primarily based upon motor function and neuroimaging techniques. While there are no cures for ADCP, some drug therapies as well as speech, occupational therapy, and physical therapy have shown capacity for treating the symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines such as {{diazepam}} are lipophilic {{and rapidly}} penetrate membranes, so rapidly cross {{over into the}} placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines including diazepam in late pregnancy, especially high doses, can result in floppy infant syndrome. Diazepam when taken late in pregnancy, during the third trimester, causes a definite risk of a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate with symptoms including <b>hypotonia,</b> and reluctance to suck, to apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Floppy infant syndrome and sedation in the newborn may also occur. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth.|$|E
25|$|Neurological {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} include cerebellar ataxia (unsteady walking with uncoordinated limb movements), dysarthria (slurred speech), dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), tremor, epilepsy (both partial and generalized), vertical supranuclear palsy (upgaze palsy, downgaze palsy, saccadic palsy or paralysis), sleep inversion, gelastic cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone or drop attacks), dystonia (abnormal movements or postures caused by contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles across joints), most commonly begins with in turning of one foot when walking (action dystonia) and may spread to become generalized, spasticity (velocity dependent increase in muscle tone), <b>hypotonia,</b> ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), microcephaly (abnormally small head), psychosis, progressive dementia, progressive hearing loss, bipolar disorder, major and psychotic depression that can include hallucinations, delusions, mutism, or stupor.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 2 years, a {{girl had}} an {{autonomic}} status epilepticus during sleep. This was characterized by pallor, progressive impairment of consciousness, and vomiting that lasted 45 minutes. A second episode occurred after 11 months, during sleep, and consisted of impairment of consciousness, <b>hypotonia,</b> deviation of the eyes to the right, hypersalivation, and right-sided clonic convulsions. It was terminated after 45 minutes with rectal diazepam. Treatment with carbamazepine was initiated. After 6 months, she had a third episode similar to the previous ones, but shorter. At the age of 4 years 9 months, during an ambulatory EEG, she had another autonomic seizure with marked ictal EEG abnormalities, but again, the interictal did not show any spikes. Carbamazepine was replaced with phenobarbital. All 12 interictal EEGs during the active seizure period, 6 of them during sleep, were normal. At last follow-up {{at the age of}} 16 years, she was well, a good student, unmedicated, and seizure-free for 11 years.|$|E
25|$|Athetosis {{can vary}} from mild to severe motor dysfunction; it is {{generally}} characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements of muscle and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture. The associated motor dysfunction can be restricted to a part of body or present throughout the body, depending on {{the individual and the}} severity of the symptom. One of the pronounced signs can be observed in the extremities in particular, as the writhing, convoluted movement of the digits. Athetosis can appear as early as 18 months from birth with first signs including difficulty feeding, <b>hypotonia,</b> spasm, and involuntary writhing movements of the hands, feet, and face, which progressively worsen through adolescence and at times of emotional distress. Athetosis is caused by lesions in several brain areas such as the hippocampus and the motor thalamus, as well as the corpus striatum; therefore children during the developmental age could possibly suffer from cognitive deficits such as speech impairment, hearing loss, and failed or delayed acquirement of sitting balance.|$|E
25|$|The {{severity}} of symptoms of idic(15) vary greatly between individuals. Individuals with idic(15) usually have delays in language development and motor {{skills such as}} walking or sitting up. Other traits may include low muscle tone (<b>hypotonia),</b> seizures (>50%), short stature, and intellectual disability. Distinctive facial features associated with idic(15), where present, are usually very subtle but may include epicanthal folds (skin folds at the inner corners of one or both eyes), broad forehead, a flattened nasal bridge, button nose, and a high arched palate (roof of the mouth). Many individuals with idic(15) display features of autism, such as problems with communication and social interactions, obsessional interests (often with interactive mechanisms like wheels, doors or switches), unpredictable sleep cycles (and a reduced need for sleep), and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (e.g., lining up toys, playing with a toy {{in the same manner}} over and over again, hand flapping, rocking back and forth). A high pain threshold is often observed. If speech develops, it is often echolalic but some individuals do grasp some language. With a severely affected person there may be an inability to walk or talk.|$|E
25|$|Familial hyperinsulinism, {{linked to}} {{mutations}} in GLUD1, {{is characterized by}} hypoglycemia that ranges from severe neonatal-onset, difficult-to-manage disease to childhood-onset disease with mild symptoms and difficult-to-diagnose hypoglycemia. Neonatal-onset disease manifests within hours to two days after birth. Childhood-onset disease manifests during the first months or years of life. In the newborn period, presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, including seizures, <b>hypotonia,</b> poor feeding, and apnea. In severe cases, serum glucose concentrations are typically extremely low and thus easily recognized, whereas in milder cases, variable and mild hypoglycemia may make the diagnosis more difficult. Even within the same family, disease manifestations can range from mild to severe. Individuals with autosomal recessive familial hyperinsulinism, caused by mutations in either ABCC8 or KCNJ11 (FHI-KATP), tend to be large for gestational age and usually present with severe refractory hypoglycemia in the first 48 hours of life; affected infants usually respond only partially to diet or medical management (i.e., diazoxide therapy) and thus may require pancreatic resection. Individuals with autosomal dominant FHI-KATP tend to be appropriate for gestational age at birth, to present at approximately age one year (range: 2 days - 30 years), and to respond to diet and diazoxide therapy. Exceptions to both of these generalities have been reported. FHI-GCK, caused by mutations in GCK, may be much milder than FHI-KATP; however, some persons have severe, diazoxide-unresponsive hypoglycemia. FHI-HADH, caused by mutations in HADH, tends to be relatively mild, although severe cases have been reported. Individuals with FHI-HNF4A, caused by mutations in HNF4A, are typically born large for gestational age and have mild features that respond to diazoxide treatment. FHI-UCP2, caused by mutations in UCP2, is a rare cause of diazoxide-responsive FH1. Hyperammonemia/hyperinsulinism (HA/HI) is associated with mild-to-moderate hyperammonemia and with relatively mild, late-onset hypoglycemia; most but not all affected individuals have mutations in GLUD1.|$|E
500|$|Damage to the {{cerebellum}} often causes motor-related symptoms, {{the details}} of which depend {{on the part of}} the cerebellum involved and how it is damaged. Damage to the [...] flocculonodular lobe may show up as a loss of equilibrium and in particular an altered, irregular walking gait, with a wide stance caused by difficulty in balancing. Damage to the lateral zone typically causes problems in skilled voluntary and planned movements which can cause errors in the force, direction, speed and amplitude of movements. Other manifestations include <b>hypotonia</b> (decreased muscle tone), dysarthria (problems with speech articulation), dysmetria (problems judging distances or ranges of movement), dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid alternating movements such as walking), impaired check reflex or rebound phenomenon, and intention tremor (involuntary movement caused by alternating contractions of opposing muscle groups). Damage to the midline portion may disrupt whole-body movements, whereas damage localized more laterally is more likely to disrupt fine movements of the hands or limbs. Damage to the upper part of the cerebellum tends to cause gait impairments and other problems with leg coordination; damage to the lower part is more likely to cause uncoordinated or poorly aimed movements of the arms and hands, as well as difficulties in speed. This complex of motor symptoms is called ataxia.|$|E
2500|$|Postural Kyphosis: Also called {{postural}} [...] "round back". This {{was found}} secondary to <b>hypotonia</b> in some children with 1p36.|$|E
2500|$|Ten (of 75) young {{patients}} had neurologic findings such as febrile seizures, single generalized seizures, mild ataxia, and muscular <b>hypotonia</b> with retarded motor development, but {{magnetic resonance imaging}} detected unilateral and bilateral T2-hyperintensive white-matter lesions in 15 patients (20%) ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, the reeler mutant mouse was {{described}} [...] by Falconer as a naturally occurring mutant. It exhibits some behavioral abnormalities, such as ataxia, tremor and <b>hypotonia,</b> which were discovered {{to be related}} to problems in neuronal migration and consequently, cytoarchitecture in the cerebellum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex.|$|E
2500|$|... 1p36 {{deletion}} syndrome (also {{known as}} monosomy 1p36) is a congenital genetic disorder characterized by {{moderate to severe}} intellectual disability, delayed growth, <b>hypotonia,</b> seizures, limited speech ability, malformations, hearing and vision impairment, and distinct facial features. The symptoms may vary, depending on {{the exact location of}} the chromosomal deletion.|$|E
2500|$|A {{neonatal}} withdrawal syndrome, sometimes severe, {{can occur}} when the mother had taken benzodiazepines, especially during the third trimester. [...] Symptoms include <b>hypotonia,</b> apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress and seizures. The neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{has been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{documented}} clinical {{interest in}} childhood cerebellar disorders {{was seen in}} 1861 when Friedreich published his paper titled “familial spino-cerebellar degeneration.” His further studies of the late 19th century noted symptoms including tremor, <b>hypotonia,</b> diminished or lost tendon jerks, and slurred speech. [...] It was in 1897 when Freud, having studied Friedreich’s work and other research of the time, suggested {{that there be a}} special category of cerebral palsy called ataxic cerebral palsy.|$|E
