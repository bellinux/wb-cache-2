5000|$|Occasionally, {{a housing}} black market develops, wherein landlords {{withdraw}} houses and apartments from the market, making them available only upon payment of additional key money, fees, or bribes—thus undermining the rent control law. Many such laws allow [...] "vacancy decontrol", releasing a dwelling from rent control upon the tenant's leaving—resulting in steady losses of rent-controlled housing, ultimately rendering rent control laws ineffective in communities {{with a high}} rate of resident turnover. In other cases social housing owned by local authorities may be sold to tenants and then sold on. Vacancy decontrol encourages landlords to find ways of shortening their residents' tenure, most aggressively through landlord harassment. To strengthen the <b>rent</b> control laws <b>of</b> New York City, housing advocates active in rent control in New York are attempting to repeal the vacancy <b>decontrol</b> clauses <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> control laws. The state <b>of</b> Massachusetts abolished <b>rent</b> control in 1994; afterwards, rents rose, accelerating the pace of Boston's gentrification; however, the laws protected few apartments, and confounding factors, such as a strong economy, had already been raising housing and rental prices.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{potential}} spillovers {{from the}} attributes {{and actions of}} neighborhood residents onto the value of surrounding properties and neighborhoods is central to both the theory of urban economics {{and the development of}} efficient housing policy. This paper measures the capitalization of housing market spillovers by studying the sudden and largely unanticipated 1995 elimination <b>of</b> stringent <b>rent</b> controls in Cambridge, Massachusetts that had previously muted landlords’ investment incentives and altered the assignment of residents to locations. Pooling administrative data on the assessed values of each residential property and the prices and characteristics of all residential transactions between 1988 and 2005, we find that rent control’s removal produced large, positive, and robust spillovers onto the price of never-controlled housing from nearby <b>decontrolled</b> units. Elimination <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> control added about $ 1. 8 billion to the value of Cambridge’s housing stock between 1994 and 2004, equal to nearly a quarter of total Cambridge residential price appreciation in this period. Positive spillovers to never-controlled properties account for more half of the induced price appreciation. Residential investments can explain {{only a small fraction of}} the total...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} forty years, rent control {{has been a}} feature of housing in Ghana. This study focusses on the housing market in Kumasi, the second largest city in Ghana. The authors examine the {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> the <b>rent</b> control regime in force there, and assess {{the costs and benefits}} <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> control, on landlords and on tenants, and its effect on the housing stock. Rent control has been successful in ensuring that housing is very inexpensive for most households, in both absolute terms and in the proportion of income devoted to rent. Thesecontrols have deprived landlords of economic returns on their property, causing them to withdraw stock from renting to use for their own family members and to reduce maintenance. However, rent control is not the only constraint on the housing market, in Kumasi or in Ghana. The paper also describes other supply side and regulatory constraints; such as those affecting land, finance, and choice of building design and materials. A number of options for relaxation/decontrol are studied {{with the aid of a}} simple present value model. Along with <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> new construction it is recommended that floating up and out of controls over a five year period should be considered, along with policy changes to ensure ready supplies of land, finance, and building materials. Such policies are essential, given that private housing investment provides the great majority of rooms in Ghanaian urban areas.

Rents are {{a significant part of the}} security for loans secured by income-producing properties such as office buildings, shopping centers, and apartments. Under present law in many states, the absolute assignment <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> is the only means by which lenders can create an effective security interest in <b>rents</b> <b>of</b> mortgaged property.

40|$|For {{the first}} time since the {{enactment}} of the windfall profit tax, quarterly liability per barrel has significantly decreased. The average windfall profit tax dropped from $ 9. 94 per barrel in the se-cond quarter of 1981 to $ 8. 55 for the third quarter, a decrease of almost 14 percent. This excise tax is generally levied on the "windfall profit " generated by the phased <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> oil prices. The windfall profit tax base is the removal price per barrel (generally the price the oil is sold for) less the adjusted base price (a set base price adjusted by a quarterly inflation factor) and the State severance tax adjustment. The windfall profit, and therefore the windfall profit tax liability, fluctuates largely with changes in oil prices. These fluctuations have been espe-cially apparent since the full <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> oil in January 1981. For the second quarter of 1981, the removal price rose 11 percent over the last quarter of 1980, the adjusted base price remained about the same, and the tax rose 43 percent. In contrast, the removal price dropped by almost $ 2. 00 per barrel from the second to the third quarter of 1981, a result of the excess supply of crude oil. Since the adjusted base price increased at the same time, the result was a significant decrease in the profit and tax. The windfall profit tax liability is also affected by adjustments made by the withholding agent. These adjustments can result from under- or over-withhold-ing or the net income limitation. Should any of these occur, the depositing or withholding agent i...|$|R

40|$|Urban {{land rent}} theory has both fascinated and {{repelled}} researchers. The fascination {{stems from the}} idea that rent holds the key to urban spatial structures and distributional conflicts. The repulsion is based on bemusement at the complexity and jargon <b>of</b> the <b>rent</b> literature and rejection <b>of</b> <b>rent's</b> assumed centrality. In this paper the author surveys the urban rent literature and presents an alternative interpretation of the role <b>of</b> urban <b>rent.</b> It is suggested that the ambiguous theoretical status <b>of</b> urban land <b>rent</b> stems from an overemphasis in the rent literature on the distributional implications <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> mechanisms {{at the expense of}} their potential influence on the social relations of building provision. The neoclassical economics model <b>of</b> urban <b>rent</b> and land use is critically evaluated and the extensive attempts to apply Marx's theory <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> to the urban situation are questioned. The ability to revive Marxist urban rent theory through the treatment <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> as a component of structures of building provision is then elaborated by reference to housing provision and office development. When placed in such a historical context, it is suggested, rent takes on a more meaningful, if less messianic, role. ...|$|R
