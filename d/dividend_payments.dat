25|$|Closely {{following}} the derivation of Black and Scholes, John Cox, Stephen Ross and Mark Rubinstein developed {{the original version}} of the binomial options pricing model. It models {{the dynamics of the}} option's theoretical value for discrete time intervals over the option's life. The model starts with a binomial tree of discrete future possible underlying stock prices. By constructing a riskless portfolio of an option and stock (as in the Black–Scholes model) a simple formula can be used to find the option price at each node in the tree. This value can approximate the theoretical value produced by Black Scholes, to the desired degree of precision. However, the binomial model is considered more accurate than Black–Scholes because it is more flexible; e.g., discrete future <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> can be modeled correctly at the proper forward time steps, and American options can be modeled as well as European ones. Binomial models are widely used by professional option traders. The Trinomial tree is a similar model, allowing for an up, down or stable path; although considered more accurate, particularly when fewer time-steps are modelled, it is less commonly used as its implementation is more complex.|$|E
500|$|The {{problem of}} declining {{revenues}} {{was not limited}} to the CLR; all of London's tube lines and the sub-surface DR and MR were affected by competition to some degree. The reduced income from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the companies to pay back borrowed capital, or to pay dividends to shareholders. The CLR's <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> fell to 3per cent from 1905, but those of the UERL's lines were as low as 0.75per cent. From 1907, the CLR, the UERL, the C, and the Great Northern & City Railway companies began to introduce fare agreements. From 1908, they began to present themselves through common branding as the Underground. In November 1912, after secret take-over talks, the UERL announced that it was purchasing the CLR, swapping one of its own shares for each of the CLR's. The take-over took effect on [...] 1913, although the CLR company remained legally separate from the UERL's other tube lines.|$|E

2500|$|A {{leveraged}} buyout (LBO) is a financial transaction {{in which a}} company is purchased {{with a combination of}} equity and debt, such that the company's cash flow is the collateral used to secure and repay the borrowed money. The use of debt, which has a lower cost of capital than equity, serves to reduce the overall cost of financing the acquisition. The cost of debt is lower because interest payments reduce corporate income tax liability, whereas <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> do not. [...] This reduced cost of financing allows greater gains to accrue to the equity, and, as a result, the debt serves as a lever to increase the returns to the equity.|$|E

30|$|As {{outlined}} above, each of {{the scenarios}} depicted a conflict between shareholding and non-shareholding stakeholders’ interests. To manipulate stakeholder management, this conflict was resolved by the airport operator deciding either in favor of shareholding stakeholders (by not fulfilling non-shareholding stakeholders’ claims and thereby prioritizing a <b>dividend</b> <b>payment</b> for shareholders over non-shareholding stakeholders’ interests) or in favor of non-shareholding stakeholders (by fulfilling non-shareholding stakeholders’ claims and thereby prioritizing non-shareholding stakeholders’ interests over a <b>dividend</b> <b>payment</b> for shareholders). In scenario 1, a decision in favor of non-shareholding stakeholders (i.e., the airport operator’s airline customers) would for example be phrased as follows: “The airport operator decides to fulfill the airline customers’ request, i.e., to clearly reduce airport fees, and thereby prioritizes the airline customers’ interests over a <b>dividend</b> <b>payment</b> for shareholders”.|$|R

40|$|Although much {{research}} on corporate dividend policy exists, {{the evidence is}} far from conclusive. Understanding how dividend taxes affect firm-level decisions is crucial to evaluating dividend imputation credits which provide shareholder-level tax credits for dividends received or decreased shareholder-level dividend tax rates, which reduce the double taxation of dividends. Using changes in New Zealand and Australia’s tax regimes, this dissertation provides new evidence {{on the relationship between}} tax incentives for R 2 ̆ 6 D investment and <b>dividend</b> <b>payment.</b> The results show that the theory that the tension between R 2 ̆ 6 D investment and <b>dividend</b> <b>payment</b> decreases when a country previously not offering tax incentives for R 2 ̆ 6 D investment or dividend payout, implements one, does not hold using New Zealand firms. Further, New Zealand dividend-paying firms with higher marginal tax rates behave in the manner predicted for firms moving from a tax regime offering a tax incentive for R 2 ̆ 6 D investment to a tax regime offering tax incentives for both R 2 ̆ 6 D investment and <b>dividend</b> <b>payment.</b> The results using Australian data, demonstrate that that the tension between R 2 ̆ 6 D investment and <b>dividend</b> <b>payment</b> increases when a country previously offering only a tax incentives for R 2 ̆ 6 D investment, offers one for both R 2 ̆ 6 D investment and <b>dividend</b> <b>payment.</b> This result is driven by firms with high marginal tax rates. These findings demonstrate that the relationship between tax incentives for R 2 ̆ 6 D investment and <b>dividend</b> <b>payment</b> varies according to firm marginal tax rates and typical <b>dividend</b> <b>payment</b> policies. It also reiterates the importance of considering firms’ abilities to use R 2 ̆ 6 D tax incentives, via their marginal tax rates, when contemplating the effects a shareholder-level dividend tax decrease will have on R 2 ̆ 6 D investment. This dissertation also provides new insight into the corporate dividend policy views. The results support the double taxation and tax irrelevance views in dividend-paying firms operating in a tax regime with dividend imputation and capital gains taxes. By documenting a significant decrease in R 2 ̆ 6 D investment after a change in dividend taxes, this dissertation also highlights a void in the current corporate dividend policy views and shows the need for the inclusion of R 2 ̆ 6 D investment...|$|R
