5|$|Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{introduces}} his illegitimate son, Donald (Michael Benjamin Washington), to the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff. Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{suspect that}} Donald is embezzling from Tracy {{as they do}} not believe that Donald is twenty-one years old, which Donald claims to be. Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), Liz's assistant, obtains Donald's birth certificate and gives it to Liz and Pete; the two learn that Donald is forty years of age, thus confirming their suspicions about him. Liz tells Tracy about this, but Tracy <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Donald's scam, explaining he decided {{to go along with it}} because Donald was putting all of the money into a dojo and doing good for the community.|$|E
25|$|Lanata also {{covered the}} fact that Báez, who was {{described}} as monopolizing all public works in Santa Cruz province, had bought several estates in Santa Cruz for US$28 million in 2007, allegedly having been informed that the province intended to build hydroelectric dams on the land. In addition, Lanata's program aired hidden-camera footage in which a Báez associate, Leonardo Fariña, admitted to involvement in a money-laundering network that handled proceeds from government corruption. Fariña had deposited 55 million euros of Báez's funds in Switzerland and said that Kirchner <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Báez's operations and was a partner in all of them.|$|E
25|$|His schoolbooks proved Macropedius to {{be a man}} {{of great}} humanist culture and {{follower}} of Erasmus. He <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the seven Free Arts and the Three Languages: Latin, Greek and Hebrew. He was very familiar with classic Greek and Roman literature, with the Bible and with the writings of the Fathers of the Church as well. Many reprints of his textbooks in the Netherlands, in Germany, in France and in England prove that Macropedius’ activities were highly esteemed by his contemporaries and by the next generation of humanists as well. By writing his books and his teachings, Macropedius contributed very much to the successful humanist educational reform {{in the first part of}} the sixteenth century. He indefatigably promoted Greek, not only the reading of the New Testament but also the study of the works of the classic Greek authors.|$|E

25|$|In 1524 conquistador Pedro de Alvarado {{arrived in}} Guatemala with 135 horsemen, 120 footsoldiers and 400 Aztec, Tlaxcaltecs and Cholultec allies. They were quickly promised {{military}} assistance by the Kaqchikels. The K'iche <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> {{the movements of}} the Spanish forces through their network of spies. When the army arrived at the K'iche' town of Xelajú Noj (Quetzaltenango) the K'iche' steward of the town sent word to Q'umarkaj. The K'iche' chose Tecún Umán, a lord from Totonicapán, as their commander against the Spanish, and he was ritually prepared for the battle. He and his 8,400 warriors met the Spanish/Aztec/Kaqchikel army outside of Pinal south of Quetzalteango and were defeated. After several more defeats the K'iche' offered the Spanish vassalage and invited them to Q'umarkaj. By way of deceit Alvarado then seized the lords of Q'umarkaj and burned them alive. He instated two lower K'iche leaders as his puppet rulers and continued to subdue the other K'iche' communities in the area. Q'umarkaj was razed and levelled to hinder the K'iche' in reestablishing themselves at the well-fortified site, and the community relocated to the nearby town of Santa Cruz del Quiché.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1938 memoirs, Dew recalled:"I {{had landed}} on July 29 by the liner Laurentic, {{arriving}} {{two days before}} the Montrose, which was already well out in the Atlantic when we first suspected that Crippen was aboard, but which was a much slower vessel than the mail steamer Laurentic. Old Crippen took it quite well. He always {{was a bit of a}} philosopher, though he could not have helped being astounded to see me on board the boat. He was quite a likeable chap in his way. Much of my time in Canada was spent evading reporters and cameramen, who <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> my arrival in spite of our efforts to keep it secret, and who frequently became personal when I did not give them a statement. As it happened, Crippen and his companion, Miss Ethel Le Neve, showed no desire to postpone our departure and waived their extradition rights, which enabled us to make the return journey after being only three weeks in Canada." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{authorities}} {{believed that}} suggestive remarks from his father, who <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> his son's crimes, {{had led him}} to commit violence. During the investigation, his father was arrested three times but released because close relatives could {{not be forced to}} testify against other family members. After Ion's last crime, when he robbed a cashier, his mother visited him and found the money under his pillow. His father made him go to the crime scene and showed him what he had done. He then took the money and placed it in his Caracal home, intending to use it to buy a new house. His father was first brought in to the police station during one of Ion's silent phases; the son merely gave his father an ugly look, prompting the latter to say [...] "How should I know what you did? How?" [...] But he had reason to suspect it, as he had been washing his son's bloody clothes after the attacks. After Ion robbed the cashier, Florea confiscated the ax and knife and it was with these that he was secretly returning when he was arrested.|$|E
