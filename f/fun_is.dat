500|$|ABC News's Allan Raible {{described}} the album as among his best work, writing, [...] "What makes this one sharp {{is that it}} really captures the current culture in a bubble {{in a way that}} is more pinpointed than on previous records." [...] Billboard considered the record's original songs its best material, and [...] "Word Crimes" [...] the best parody. Paste similarly agreed that Yankovic's original materials were the highlight of the album, and that as a whole, Mandatory <b>Fun</b> <b>is</b> [...] "a good, humorous album that shows that Yankovic is not slowing down in the slightest".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the game's level design was also widely positive. Game Informers Jon wrote that [...] "The tracks are imaginative with the hidden tokens, emeralds and alternate paths", while EGMs Dan called them [...] "some of the most well-designed tracks ever". Sackenheim, Kelly, EGMs John, and Game Informers Andy thought similarly. Nutter compared the level design {{to that of the}} 16-bit Sonic titles and Sonic Team's Nights into Dreams..., noting that [...] "far more <b>fun</b> <b>is</b> to be gleamed [...] from the exploration element" [...] than [...] "the temptation... to leg it through each of the levels in a time trial-like way". In a similar vein, Next Generation described Sonic R and Nintendo 64 contemporary Diddy Kong Racing as [...] "less of a racing title and more of a driving adventure game". Nutter commented on the replay value provided by alternate modes, such as [...] "Get 5 Balloons!", but conceded that [...] "five tracks don't really suffice, even with the reverse mode". MacDonald, Dan, and Jon also expressed disappointment with the limited selection of levels.|$|E
500|$|Mandatory Fun debuted {{atop the}} United States Billboard 200 on {{the week of}} August 2, 2014. This makes it Yankovic's first number one album on the chart in his more than 30-year career.

Mandatory <b>Fun</b> <b>is</b> also the first comedy album to reach the number one spot since Allan Sherman's My Son, the Nut in August 1963. It {{achieved}} the largest sales week for a comedy album since The Beavis and Butt-head Experience in 1994 after selling 104,700 copies during the sales week ending July 20, 2014.

500|$|Michael Gragg of MusicOMH {{wrote that}} [...] "Though the lyrics are daft [...] it's {{exuberance}} and {{general sense of}} <b>fun</b> <b>is</b> so infectious that when the chorus kicks in you barely notice what she's saying." [...] Jer Fairall of PopMatters wrote, [...] "Look {{no further than the}} wry chorus hook of “Fembot” for proof of Robyn’s deftly subversive sense of humor." [...] Fairall also pointed out that [...] " [...] might hint, at first, in the direction of some Blade Runner-esque sci-fi pathos, but Robyn turns it towards a canny meta-commentary on the fluid sense of authenticity that pervades 21st century pop stardom." [...] Fairall, however, thought that [...] "the verses are nothing more than an inventory of the titular ‘bot’s synthetic virtues." [...] Ben Norman of About.com selected the song as his favorite track on Body Talk Pt. 1, and wrote that [...] "'Fembot' is the incredibly quirky and well-written Robyn-rap track that needs to be heard to be believed." [...] Christopher Muther of The Boston Globe praised the song for having [...] "one of the most entertaining lyrics to emerge this year".|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, Kreisberg {{described}} the episodes as {{very important to}} both Barry and Oliver {{and what they are}} going thorough, while also promising [...] "one of the biggest surprises for Arrow of all time in The Flash episode". Guggenheim added, [...] "It's like the bomb underneath the table, and I think part of the <b>fun</b> <b>is</b> waiting to see when Oliver is going to learn what the audience learns on Flash." [...] It was later announced that another secret would be revealed in the final moments of The Flash episode that will help [...] "introduce the next phase of The Flash in a big way". In the episode, Oliver runs into an ex-girlfriend, last seen pregnant with his child in season two of Arrow and had been told by Oliver's mother Moira to tell him that she'd lost the baby and disappear. It is revealed to the viewers that she has a child and it's presumed to be Oliver's. After the airing of the episode, Guggenheim confirmed that indeed it was Oliver's child. At the end of the episode, Robbie Amell, who played Ronnie Raymond—Caitlin's former fiancée presumed dead after the particle accelerator explosion—appears as Firestorm using his powers.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive reviews. Chris Williams of Billboard {{said the}} song is [...] "Max Martin and Spears at their best: a stomping dance floor beat with building synths prodding the song along and the singer sounding like she's having a blast being the bad girl". Rolling Stone writer Caryn Ganz called the song one of the standout tracks of the album. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian commented that her stronger and confident delivery in the chorus was noticeably lacking {{in the rest of}} the album. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle also said that the [...] "more aggressive, pointed persona" [...] Spears adopts in {{the song is}} one of the high points of the album. The Emory Wheels writer Julia Cox called it [...] "the album's strongest and most unorthodox song". Ricardo Baca of The Denver Post named the song the most fascinating track of the album and commented on the euphemism, saying [...] "It's trashy and clever, and it's also quite fun. And <b>fun</b> <b>is</b> exactly what Spears should be aiming for". However, there were also some negative reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the song is [...] "a Katy Perry-styled exercise in crass commercial carnality that is at once the best and worst song here". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "" [...] and added that [...] "it'll be a middle-school sensation". NME named it one of the filthiest songs of all time.|$|E

500|$|The Punch {{serialisation}} attracted little critical comment; The Athenaeums {{literary critic}} thought the series [...] "may have escaped unnoticed amid better jokes". When the Diary was published as a book, Punch heralded {{it in its}} issue of 23 July 1892 as [...] "very funny", adding: [...] "not without a touch of pathos". However, apart from a warmly approving report in The Saturday Review, the book's initial critical reception was lukewarm. The Reviews critic thought the book [...] "admirable, and in some of its touches [...] goes close to genius", with a natural and irresistible appeal: [...] "The Diary has amused us from cover to cover". This contrasted with the negative judgement of The Athenaeum, which opined that [...] "the book has no merit to compensate for its hopeless vulgarity, not even that of being amusing". It questioned the tastefulness of jokes aimed almost exclusively at the poverty of underpaid city clerks, and concluded: [...] "Besides, it is all so dull". [...] The Speakers critic thought the book [...] "a study in vulgarity", while The New York Times, reviewing the first American edition, found the work largely incomprehensible: [...] "There {{is that kind of}} quiet, commonplace, everyday joking in it which we are to suppose is highly satisfactory to our cousins across the water... Our way of manufacturing <b>fun</b> <b>is</b> different". Although details of sales figures are not given, Arrowsmiths later acknowledged that the early editions of the book did not have a wide public impact.|$|E
500|$|GamesRadar {{offered some}} {{praise for the}} system and its library, stating, [...] "With its 8-bit {{processor}} and bright color screen, it was basically the Sega Master System in your hands. How many batteries did we suck dry playing Sonic, Madden and Road Rash on the bus or in the car, or in the dark when {{we were supposed to}} be sleeping? You couldn't do that on a Game Boy!" [...] By contrast, IGN reviewer Levi Buchanan noted the Game Gear's biggest fault was its game library when compared to the Game Boy, stating that [...] "the software was completely lacking compared to its chief rival, which was bathed in quality games. It didn't matter that the Game Gear was more powerful. The color screen did not reverse any fortunes. Content and innovation beat out technology, a formula that Nintendo is using right now with the continued ascendance of the DS and Wii." [...] Buchanan later went on to praise some parts of the Game Gear's library, however, stating [...] "Some of those Master System tweaks were very good games, and <b>fun</b> <b>is</b> resilient against time." [...] Retro Gamer praised Sega's accomplishment in surviving against the competition of Nintendo in the handheld console market with the Game Gear, noting that [...] "for all the handhelds that have gone up against the might of Nintendo and ultimately lost out, Sega's Game Gear managed to last the longest, only outdone in sales by the Sony PSP. [...] For its fans, it will remain a piece of classic gaming hardware whose legacy lives on forever." ...|$|E
500|$|Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger {{published}} a positive review {{for the complete}} anime series. He wrote that the premise presented many flaws but were balanced out by other aspects: Sora and Shiro's [...] "over-powered hero" [...] archetype is balanced out by their flawed lifestyles, motives, and their [...] "visible delight in crushing their enemies"; Stephanie Dola's mistreatment with gags and Sora and Shiro's growing respect towards her; and the harem aspect with Sora's apathy and interesting female characters. Regardless, Kimlinger praised the plot's [...] "big games", calling them the reason to watch the series and described them as [...] "steeped in trickery and strategy"; he added that despite knowing the protagonists would win, the <b>fun</b> <b>is</b> seeing how they do it. Kimlinger wrote the over-saturation art style will be an acquired taste for most viewers and praised how the animation really shines during the [...] "big games", calling it an impressive display of fluidity and timing. Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis was also positive towards the series, praising the protagonists' dynamic, echoed Kimlinger's sentiments about the games, liked the animation, but noted his dislike for fan service featuring Shiro. He also ranked the series {{as one of the}} top five anime series of 2014, and recommended it for viewers who like smart characters and gamer humor. Similarly, TAYKotaku also praised the dynamics, references to other anime and video games, and the art style; the reviewer had mixed feelings towards the harem aspect and sexual humor, and agreed with Kotaku's dislike for the fan service featuring Shiro. IGN echoed previous opinions, praising the character dynamics, and also questioned the amount of unnecessary fanservice.|$|E
