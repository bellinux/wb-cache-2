50|$|One {{contentious}} issue in debates about climate justice {{is the extent}} to which capitalism is viewed as its root cause. This question frequently leads to fundamental disagreements between, on the one hand, liberal and conservative environmental groups and, on the other, leftist and radical organizations.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{describe}} the enantioselective synthesis of mono- and di-ortho-substituted ferrocenyl diketones via our SAMP/RAMP-hydrazone method. Keystep is the stepwise diastereoselective ortho-metalation of 1, 1 '-bisbenzoylferrocene-bis-SAMP-hydrazone followed by trapping of various types of electrophiles. Within our studies we demonstrate the broad applicability of this method by using alkyl-, silyl-, phosphin- and sulfur electrophiles. We obtained the desired products in very good yields (85 - 100 %) and high diastereoselectivities (de >= 96 %). The monosubstituted bis-SAMP-hydrazones prepared, could either undergo a second diastereoselective ortho-substitution under the same conditions to lead to 2, 2 '-substituted bis-SAMP-hydrazones or could be cleaved to produce mono-substituted 1, 1 '-bisbenzoylferrocenes. In case of second substitutions we applied alkylation, silylation, phosphinylation, hydroxyalkylation and sulfenylation rections in good yields (45 - 89 %) and high diastereoselectivities (de >= 96 %). To obtain the disubstituted diketones, {{it was necessary to}} cleave the corresponding SAMP-hydrazones. We obtained the desired products in very good yields (28 - 98 %) and high diastereoselectivities (de >= 96 %). Furthermore we developed an efficient asymmetric synthesis of planar chiral monosubstituted diferrocenylketones in good yields and excellent enantiomeric <b>exesses</b> employing the SAMP/RAMP hydrazone methodology. These compounds are versatile starting materials for further synthetic transformations. A second diastereoselective ortho-metalation without a further chiral auxiliary led to the planar chiral disubstituted diferrocenyl ketones in moderate to very good yields and moderate to excellent diastereoselectivities. Reduction using a mixed hydride of LAH and AlCl 3 led to the mono- and disubstituted diferocenyl methanes without epimerisation in good to excellent yields. The application of these novel compounds as ligands in asymmetric catalysis was investigated in palladium catalyzed cross-coupling of 1 -phenylethyl magnesium chloride with vinyl bromide to give 3 -phenyl- 1 -butene in very good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Partly these are the best results in this reaction ever described in literature...|$|R
40|$|Banana is an {{important}} fruit crop of tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. It requires high quantity of nutrients that must be supplied through fertilization to obtain optimum yields. To diagnose nutrient deficiencies and <b>exesses</b> using plant analysis is appealing. The nutrient content of plants provides reliable information on their nutritional status at the date of sampling, thus giving a guide not only to any supplementary fertilizer needs of the current crop {{but also to the}} probable requirements of future crops. Although it is more costly than soil testing and needs more care in the handling of samples, this method is growing in importance. Interpretation is usually based on the total contents of nutrients in leaves, or other suitable plant parts, in comparison with critical nutrient concentrations or critical values. Another different and fairly new system of plant analysis interpretation is the Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) in which interpretation is based on a comparison of calculated elemental ratio indices with established norms. Since bananas are grown from between latitudes 33 Â° north and south and {{on a wide range of}} soils, the mineral nutrition of the crop has attracted much attention. The overall requirements of nutrients cab be estimated from analysis of the whole plant and estimated plant growth. The grower needs to know the ability of the soil to meet these requirements and whether supplementary fertilizer is needed. Two approaches have been adopted to solve this problem viz., field experiments and the analysis of plant and soil with the aim of estimating the amount of fertilizer required to optimize yields. Lots of researches have been done regarding banana nutrition management and on its related aspects. This paper encompasses the reviews on the use of plant analysis as a diagnostic tool for banana nutrition management, banana sampling for plant analysis, utilization of plant analysis data, plant analysis interpretation using critical level concept and DRIS norms and most importantly banana nutrition management with special reference to Pakistan...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{optimised}} a procedure to synthesize 1, 3 -amino alcohols and applied it {{to a wide}} range of substituted substrates. Starting from aldehyde SAMP-hydrazones we obtained beta-hydroxy SAMP-hydrazones in a titanium-mediated aza-analogous aldol reaction. After protection, 1, 2 -addition and cleavage of the chiral auxiliary the products could be isolated over five steps in 30 to 54 % overall yield and diastereomeric excesses of 78 to 84 % and enantiomeric excesses over 96 %. Furthermore we developed a hydrazone Strecker-method for the asymmetric synthesis of alpha-amino acids. The method was tested by the synthesis of six examples, including 2 -amino- 3 -phosphonopropionic acid. The first step was the addition of TMSCN to SAMP-hydrazones to obtain hydrazino nitriles. After protection with Moc-Cl and N-N-bound cleavage with MMPP the resulting protected amino nitriles were easily converted into alpha-amino acids by acidic hydrolysis of the nitrile group under concurrent deprotection. The alpha-amino acids were synthesized in four steps in 10 to 50 % overall yield. The enantiomeric excesses of 94 to 97 % were determined on the diasteriomeric excesses of the Mosher-amides. We established the absolute configuration by comparison of the NMR-spektra of the Mosher-amides with the spectra of the Mosher-amide of a 1 : 2 induced sample of the purchasable alpha-amino butanoic acid. The combination of several known methods and their optimisation gave us the possibility to synthesize gamma-hydroxy alpha-amino acids in a highly diastereo- und enantioselective manner. This pathway has only slight differences to that used for the synthesis of 1, 3 -amino alcolhols. In the 1, 2 -addition we added ceriumfuryl to the C=N-double bound of the hydrazones. After cleavage of the chiral auxiliary the following ozonolysis resulted in gamma-hydroxy alpha-amino acids after six steps in 21 to 27 % overall yield. The diastereo- und enantiomeric <b>exesses</b> were higher 96 %. 1, 3 -Amino alcohols and gamma-hydroxy alpha-amino acids are important building blocks in the synthesis of natural products with biological activity...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Environmental {{factors which}} {{have changed in}} {{the last decade or so}} appear to be largely {{responsible}} for the increase in the prevalence of asthma in affluent countries. It should, therefore, be possible to design interventions to reverse these recent trends and reduce the incidence of asthma. Primary preventive strate-gies have the potential not only to reduce acquisition of sensitization to common allergens and the risk that symptoms will develop subsequently, but also to reduce morbidity in those who already have persistent disease. There is accumulating epi-demiological evidence that a dietary <b>exess</b> of sodium and omega- 6 fatty acids, a dietary deficiency of antioxidant vitamins and omega- 3 fatty acids, reduced rates of breastfeeding and exposure to allergens and environmental tobacco smoke are all involved in the aetiology of asthma. The modification of these factors has the potential to reduce the incidence and thus the prevalence of this disease. Environmental intervention should be particularly effective in children who have inherited or acquired characteristics which put them at high risk of developing asthma. With the evidence now available, it seems reasonable to assume that interventions which are based on our current knowledge of risk factors could achieve a 50 % reduction in the prevalence of asthma in the next generation of children...|$|E

40|$|MasterThe {{catalysis}} {{of organic}} reactions mediated by transition metals {{has become an}} essential tool for chemical synthesis. But gold complexes have only recently been investigated as a catalyst. In the past 10 years, a number of gold catalysis have been published. Gold-catalyzed reactions have a unique feature. Unlike many Lewis acids, gold catalysts are exceptionally alkynophilic. The most fundamental reactivity pattern in gold-catalysed reactions is the activation of a C-C multiple bond, in most cases an alkyne, for the attack of a nucleophile. This special feature has occupied the attention of synthetic chemist. Of particular interest to organic chemists is methodology development towards the syntheses of carbocycles and heterocycles. Various synthetic methods to construct {{a wide range of}} carbocycles and hetereocycles using gold catalyst were reported in recent years. In these reports, cycles were made by intramoleculr addition of various carbon and heteroatom nucleophiles with activated alkyne by gold catalyst. A highly efficient gold(I) -catalyzed reaction initiated by the addition of silyl ethers to alkynes has been developed. This gold(I) -catalyzed transformations are accomplished under mild conditions and they showed substituent tolerance. This catalytic reaction has synthetic advantage in that it provides highly functionalized 2 -cyclopentenones possesing a quarternary carbon center. The 'herbertanes", a small group of sesquiterpenes was synthesized using gold(I) -catalyzed reaction. Herbetanes group is containing sterically crowded 1 -aryl- 1, 2, 2 -trimethyl-cyclopentane carbon framework with two vicinal quaternary carbon atoms on a cyclopentane ring. The herbertanes are interesting synthetic targets owing to the difficulty associated with the construction of vicinal quaternary carbon atoms on a framework. The interesting biological properties of the phenolic herbertanes make them important synthetic targets of current interest. The formal synthesis of (Î±) -herbertene, (Î±) -herbertenol, (Î²) -herbertenol and herbertenone A and B have been achieved. 5 -Siloxypent- 3 -en- 1 -ynes were synthesized from ace-tophenones possessing various substituent on phenyl ring. And then gold(I) -catalyzed reactions as key-step were operated under mild conditions to give cyclopentenones in moderate yield and tolerate all cases. So this result demonstretes that gold(I) -catalyzed synthesis of 2 -cyclopentenone {{can be applied to the}} synthesis of structural diverse and complex compound. To achieve an enantioselective synthesis of cuparene, isomer of herbertene, a gold(I) -catalyzed reaction was pursed. If the chirality is transferred to the product in gold(I) -catalyzed reaction, this catalyzed reaction can be applied to enantioselective synthesis. To examine the possibility of chirality transfer, 5 -siloxypent- 3 -en- 1 -yne having chirality was made by asymmetric dihydroxylation using AD-mix-Î±. And then this substrate was subjected to gold(I) -catalyzed synthesis of 2 -cyclopentenone. The enantiomeric <b>exess</b> of substrate was almost transfered to the product. The synthesis of chiral substrate with high eneantiomeric <b>exess</b> is need to see the degree of chirality transfer...|$|E

The reactor is then simulated using the MCNP code, and its reactivity variation due to adding a 1. 5 mm thick beryllium shim plate {{to the top of the}} reactor core, after 7 years of operation, is calculated. The results show good agreement with the available data collected at the revival time. <b>Exess</b> reactivity of the reactor at present time (after 14 years of operation and after 7 years of the the reactor revival time) is also determined both experimentally and by calculation, which show good agreement, and indicate that at the present time there is no need to add any further beryllium shim plate to the top of the reactor core. Furthermore, by adding more beryllium layers with various thicknesses to the top of the reactor core, in the input program of the MCNP program, reactivity value of these layers is calculated. From these results, one can predict the necessary beryllium thickness needed to reach a desired reactivity in the MNSR reactor...|$|E

Generally, layer manufacturing technology does not need any assistance devices neither cut appliances. In layer manufactunring proces, the product is unlimited by the level of geometri complexity, where as the conduction can not being done in conventional process (machining, casting, forming) so that significantly it will reduce the cycle time in production, increase the product quality and reduce the expense of engine treatment. 	In mechanical enginering scope, the component phisical model by manufacturing layer process is being succed if some aspect fulfilled, sucs as the appropriate form and dememsion also the enough streght. 	Generally, rapid prototyping applies deposition sytem which is being done with a single material. As the technology grows, it claims the rapid prototyping engine to have an <b>exess</b> that can work by applying the multi material (one material one device). 	One of the rapid prototyping engine is (MMD-IS), this kind of engine applies the movement coordinate X, Z axis for the movement system of solid object formation. That movement applies rails which has some balls as the movement support of pollen deposition process. The transmision system in this device applies timing belt, axis and timing gear.
