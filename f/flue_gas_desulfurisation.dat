It reports on the sulfate resistance of mortars containing a typical simulated desulfurised waste (SDW). Two binder systems were investigated: (a) cement and SDW with replacement levels of 0 to 70 % and (b) cement (10 %), slag (20 – 90 %) and SDW. The influence of SDW content (0 – 70 %) on sulfate resistance was evaluated. Specimens were exposed to 2 · 2 % sodium sulfate solution and 2 · 44 % magnesium sulfate solution. The results showed that replacing cement with increasing levels of SDW improved the sulfate resistance in each sulfate solution. This was attributed to the dilution of C 3 A and CH due to the reduction in cement, pore refinement and the formation of ettringite during early periods of hydration. Mortars containing cement, slag and SDW exhibited superior sulfate resistance in sodium sulfate solution. When immersed in magnesium sulfate solution, they underwent some deterioration due to the reaction with the C–S–H, CH and C–A–H phases.

Although the final aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the partitioning of boron in a (co-) combustion power plant, special attention was paid to the analytical procedure for boron determination. A sample preparation procedure was optimised for coal and combustion by-products to overcome some specific shortcomings of the currently used acid digestion methods. In addition boron mass balances and removal efficiencies in ESP and FGD devices were calculated. Mass balance closures between 83 and 149 % were obtained. During coal combustion, 95 % of the incoming boron was collected in the fly ashes. The use of petroleum coke as co-combustible produced a decrease in the removal efficiency of the ESP (87 %). Nevertheless, more than 90 % of the remaining gaseous boron was eliminated via the FGD in the wastewater discharged from the scrubber, thereby causing environmental problems.

40|$|International audienceConstant {{strengthening}} on the {{air pollution}} control regulations demands for new system designs and optimization of <b>Flue</b> <b>Gas</b> <b>Desulfurisation</b> (FGD) process, for the SO 2 emissions control. Effluents from waste incineration, fossil fuel‐fired boilers and biogas treatment have reported concentrations up to 10, 000 ppm on SO 2; instead current regulations demand it as low as 0. 044 ppm, depending on its source. High life‐cycle cost and permanent need of solid replacement from available dry FGD systems have made it unattractive for mid/small scale treatment units, as for the case of biogas. A system optimization for a dry FGD system using solid NaHCO 3 is proposed, in order to decompose the SO 2 into Na 2 SO 3, CO 2 and H 2 O by a reaction system. Numerical models accounting for different mechanical designs, gas regimes, mass transfer, pressure drop, and properties variations of the solid bed have been established. Obtained results have confirmed the strong dependence on the pressure drop calculations once designing this type of systems, {{as well as its}} enhancement due to multi‐furcation of the feed stream. Results have also shown that though solids in the powder size range (< 140 μm) may improve molecular diffusion and accelerate the reaction rate, the need for higher sorbent dispersion reducing the pressure drop of the solid bed trends to favor the use of granular size bicarbonate (aprox. 350 μm) for dry FGD systems. Experimental work is used to validate the calculations. Considering a conventional process for biogas treatment and based on the obtained results, process intensification has been developed to confirm the higher efficiency of the proposed system. Higher efficiency in terms of the available exergy of the system is estimated as compared to other available technologies for the desulfurization process. The major energy efficiency improvements in biogas units are expected to come from waste heat reuse and the avoidance of acid corrosion...|$|E
40|$|Air {{pollution}} by {{sulfur dioxide}} {{is of great}} concern due to its harmful effects on environment, human beings, fauna and flora. Fossil-fuel-fired power plants {{are one of the}} major sources of SO 2 emissions. Typically the concentration of SO 2 in the flue gases of these plants is in the range of 2000 to 20000 ppm. <b>Flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>desulfurisation</b> is one of the widely practiced strategies to control SO 2 emissions. Aqueous phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide catalysed by carbonaceous particles is an attractive alternative to the conventional processes for <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>desulfurisation</b> because, amongst other reasons, sulfuric acid, the product of aqueous phase oxidation, finds extensive application in industry. In the literature {{it has been reported that}} sulfuric acid affects the solubility of sulfur dioxide and that activated carbon catalyses aqueous phase oxidation. However there is hardly any report on the systematic evaluation of the mechanism of the heterogeneous aqueous phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide which takes into account among other factors, the effect of sulfuric acid on the solubility of SO 2 (particularly, at low levels of SO 2 and sulfuric acid concentrations). Therefore the objective of the present work is to evaluate systematically the aqueous phase oxidation of SO 2 in ppm levels with activated carbon as catalyst in a three-phase agitated slurry reactor and to model rigorously the solubility of SO 2 in ppm levels in dilute sulfuric acid solutions and to estimate the concerned parameters experimentally. Strong effect of dilute concentrations of sulfuric acid on the solubility of SO 2 is analyzed in terms of the influence of the acid on the equilibrium concentrations of the ionic species (HSO 3 ¯ and SO 4 ¯ 2 formed from the hydrolysis of SO 2 (aq) and the dissociation of H 2 SO 4 respectively) in SO 2 - dil. H 2 SO 4 systems. The analysis leads to a general expression relating the partial pressure of SO 2 in the gas phase to the concentration of total dissolved SO 2 and the concentration of sulfuric acid in the solution. Simple equations are obtained from the general expression for the cases of zero and high concentrations of sulfuric acid in the system, which in turn lead to direct experimental determination of the parameters, Henry's law constant and the equilibrium constant of hydrolysis of SO 2 (aq). The developed model predicts the present experimental data as well as the data reported in the literature very closely. The dissolution of SO 2, the hydrolysis of SO 2 (aq) and the dissociation of H 2 SO 4 are found to be instantaneous. From the dependency of the parameters on temperature, the heat of dissolution of SO 2 is determined to be - 31. 47 kJ mol" 1 and the heat of hydrolysis to be 15. 69 kJ mol" 1. The overall heat of solubility of sulfur dioxide is therefore - 15. 78 kJ mol" 1. Preliminary reaction experiments have clearly indicated that SO 2 (aq) does not react and HSO 3 ¯ is the only reactant for aqueous phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide catalysed by activated carbon. The non-reactant SO 2 (aq) deactivates the oxidation reaction by competing with HSO 3 ¯ for adsorption on the active sites of the catalyst particles. However the catalyst particles become saturated with SO 2 (aq) beyond a certain value of its concentration (saturation limit), which depends on temperature. A mechanism is proposed based on these observations to develop a rate model. The rate model also takes into account the effect of the concentration of the product sulfuric acid on the solubility of sulfur dioxide. The model predicts first order in HSO 3 ¯, half order in dissolved oxygen and a linear deactivation effect of 5 O 2 (ag). The oxidation reaction is evaluated experimentally at various levels of the operating variables such as temperature and the concentrations of sulfur dioxide and oxygen in the inlet gas. In all experiments a pseudo steady-state region is observed where the gas phase concentration of SO 2 reaches a steady value but the concentrations of HSO 3 ¯ and total S (VI) in the liquid phase continue to change. Pseudo steady-state considerations lead to the determination of the initial estimates of the parameters of the rate model namely, the rate constant and the deactivation constant. These parameters are estimated from the transient profiles of the product (sulfuric acid) by solving the model equations by Runge-Kutta method along with Marquardt's non-linear parameter estimation algorithm. The predictions of the model with the estimated parameters match very well with the experimentally observed concentration profiles of S(VI) and HSO 3 in the liquid phase and SO 2 in the gas phase. The deactivation constant in the saturation range is independent of temperature and is 0. 27, which indicates that the intrinsic rate constant is about four times greater than the observed rate constant. From Arrhenius equation-type dependency of the parameters on temperature, the activation energy for the oxidation reaction is determined to be 93. 55 kJ mol" 1 and for deactivation to be 21. 4 kJ mol" 1. The low value of activation energy for deactivation suggests a weak dependency of the deactivation on temperature, which perhaps is due to the weak nature of the chemisorption of SO 2 (aq) on carbon...|$|E
