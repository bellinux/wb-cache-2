2500|$|Rather than {{simultaneously}} superimposing successive {{images to}} depict motion, Metzinger represents {{the subject at}} rest from multiple angles. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>role</b> is played by the artist rather than the subject. By moving around the subject the artist captures several important features at once; such as the profile and frontal view. And because motion involves time, several intervals or moments are captured simultaneously (a process coined by Metzinger called simultaneity or multiplicity). Moods and expressions within each facet may be different, reflecting change over time. The result, according to Metzinger is a more complete representation {{of the subject matter}} (a 'total image') than would otherwise have resulted from one image taken at one instant. Each facet reveals something new and different about the subject. Sutured together, these facets would form a more complete image than an otherwise static representation seen from one point of view; what Metzinger called a [...] "total image".|$|E
2500|$|An Involved {{society is}} a highly {{advanced}} group that has achieved galaxy-wide involvement with other cultures or societies.

In the novels, the Culture might be considered the premier Involved society, or at least the most dynamic and energetic, especially given that the Culture itself is a growing multicultural fusion of Involved societies. The Involved are contrasted with the Sublimed, groups that have reached a high level of technical development and galactic influence but subsequently abandoned physical reality, ceasing to take serious interventionist interest in galactic civilization. They are also contrasted with what some Culture people loosely refer to as [...] "barbarians", societies of intelligent beings which lack the technical capacity to know about or take a serious role in their interstellar neighbourhood. There are also the elder civilisations, which are civilizations that reached the required level of technology for sublimation, but chose not to, and have retreated from the larger galactic meta-civilization.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} <b>dynamic</b> object <b>roles</b> as a facility for conceptual modeling and as a data structure to be implemented in object-oriented or object-relational database management systems. We show that the concept is useful for a real business case. We discuss advantages of the concept and known approaches to implement it. A new approach is proposed, which assumes that a role is a distinguished subobject of an object. A role inherits dynamically attribute values and methods of its parent object. Objects can be accessed by their names, {{as well as by}} the names of their roles. The role concept essentially changes the semantics of other notions of object-oriented models, such as classes, inheritance and substitutability.

40|$|Virtual teams allow {{individuals}} {{to cooperate with}} others across both space and time. However, {{in the absence of}} proximal presence, virtual teams encounter difficulty developing trust outside of specific circumstances. Its acquisition is contingent on individuals 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of others 2 ̆ 7 ability, benevolence, and integrity, and one 2 ̆ 7 s own tendency to engage in trusting behavior. In virtual settings, it is difficult to assess these qualities in others. Without trust, teams have difficulty engaging in tasks that do not have simple and finite solutions. When playing in virtual contexts where roles are in flux, individuals can experiment with the identity of others as well as their own. This experimentation may influence how individuals assess others 2 ̆ 7 ability, benevolence, and integrity, and the level of trust between teammates. Playing with perceptions of trust and its antecedents thereby determines whom individuals trust and to what degree. By placing a context for identity experimentation in parallel to a context for work, perceptions of trust and its antecedents can be ported from one domain to the other. To test this, eight virtual teams worked to complete three tasks in a quasi-experimental design. These teams were divided into two conditions: a chat-based work environment and a game-based work environment with <b>dynamic</b> <b>roles.</b> Analyses of survey data over three time intervals indicate that playing with <b>dynamic</b> <b>roles</b> enhances perceptions of trust, benevolence, and integrity among members of a virtual team. Qualitative analyses of chat transcripts indicate that role shifting, a non-restrictive swift trust framework, enjoyment, and other themes were integral to the development of trust in these teams. These findings suggest that a key factor in trust development in virtual teams is to provide them with a space distinct from the work environment in which members can experiment with a variety of roles in the presence of their teammates. Further, play featuring <b>dynamic</b> <b>roles</b> can foster trust development in virtual contexts, allowing individuals with limited proximal presence to engage in trusting behavior, consequently enhancing the ability to collaborate on complex tasks. These findings are discussed within the context of literature on virtual organizations, trust development, and cultural game studies. ...|$|R
