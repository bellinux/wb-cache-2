The diet in autumn, winter and early spring becomes mainly fruit, including berries such as the <b>European</b> <b>Hackberry</b> (Celtis australis) and Sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), rose hips, and domesticated crops such as apples, grapes and pears where available. It has been observed eating flowers of Crocus vernus albiflorus, including the pistils, perhaps {{as a source of}} carotenoids. The chough will readily supplement its winter diet with food provided by tourist activities in mountain regions, including ski resorts, refuse dumps and picnic areas. Where additional food is available, winter flocks are larger and contain a high proportion of immature birds. The young birds principally frequent the sites with the greatest food availability, such as refuse dumps. Both chough species will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E

40|$|Inonotus rickii is a {{basidiomycete}} {{that causes}} cankers and decay in several ornamental trees, {{and has been}} reported in Portugal since 2002. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the incidence of the disease caused by I. rickii on Celtis australis, in the community of Alcântara, Lisbon, where the <b>European</b> <b>hackberry</b> tree is the main sidewalk species. Disease incidence reached 19 %, and affected trees showed sparse foliage, death of branches and white rot of heartwood. In some cases, chlamydospores masses and basidiocarps occurred on trunks and branches, especially on trees with more than 40 cm of DBH. Considering the increasingly importance of I. rickii and being C. australis {{one of the most important}} ornamental species used in the green areas of Lisbon, morphological and cultural characteristics of the pathogen are presented and its impact as agent of decline of urban trees is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Rehabilitation {{of woody}} {{riparian}} galleries largely {{depends on the}} availability of seedlings or seeds of autochthonous species, which are usually difficult to obtain in Portugal. The cultural value of autochthonous seeds of several riparian woody species in nursery conditions was evaluated in order to assess seedling production feasibility. The choice of species was based on their occurrence in riparian habitats, even if not exclusive to such environments, and their suitability to establishment studies currently under way. The results indicate that seeds of Celtis australis, Fraxinus angustifolia, Quercus robur, Q. faginea and Platanus × hybrida obtained in Portugal were highly suited to seedling production. Germination of seeds of Acer pseudoplatanus and A. campestre was much more irregular and seeds from Alnus glutinosaand Crataegus monogyna exhibited a very low germination rate. We conclude that seedling production of <b>European</b> <b>hackberry,</b> oaks, narrow-leaved ash, and plane tree and, less clearly, maples, can be successfully carried out in nursery conditions using simple and unsophisticated sowing techniques. For common alder and whitethorn it is preferable to produce seedlings via vegetative propagation as an alternative to more sophisticated nursery pre-germination treatments...|$|E
