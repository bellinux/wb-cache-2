2500|$|Since {{at least}} the late-1890s, the only {{artifacts}} remaining from the original well were the <b>drilling</b> <b>tools</b> and drivepipe, much to the disappointment of visitors to Drake Well. In 1945, the Pennsylvania General Assembly appropriated $185,000 {{for the construction of}} a replica derrick and engine house, including pumping equipment. The [...] "board-for-board replica" [...] was duplicated from photographs of the well taken by John A. Mather from the 1860s. Drake Well was listed on National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark on November13, 1966 by the National Park Service. It was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in October1979. Authentic reproductions of the steam engine and boiler were purchased in Erie and installed in 1986. The American Chemical Society designated the Drake Well a National Historic Chemical Landmark on August27, 2009, the 150th anniversary of the strike.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an impact dynamic {{analysis of a}} percussive system based on rotary-percussive ultrasonic drill (RPUD). The RPUD employs vibrations on two sides of one single piezoelectric stack to achieve rotary-percussive motion, which improves drilling efficiency. The RPUD’s percussive system is composed of a percussive horn, a free mass, and a <b>drill</b> <b>tool.</b> The percussive horn enlarges longitudinal vibration from piezoelectric stack and delivers the vibration to the <b>drill</b> <b>tool</b> through the free mass, which forms the percussive motion. Based on the theory of conservation of momentum and Newton’s impact law, collision process of the percussive system under no-load condition is analyzed to establish the collision model between the percussive horn, the free mass, and the <b>drill</b> <b>tool.</b> The collision model shows that free mass transfers high-frequency small-amplitude vibration of percussive horn into low-frequency large-amplitude vibration of <b>drill</b> <b>tool</b> through impact. As an important parameter of free mass, the greater {{the weight of the}} free mass, the higher the kinetic energy obtained by <b>drill</b> <b>tool</b> after collision. High-speed camera system and drilling experiments are employed to validate the inference results of collision model by using a prototype of the RPUD...|$|R

It is shown experimentally that the efficiency of drilling by a multicutter <b>drilling</b> <b>tool</b> may be improved by using the interaction between crack systems from neighboring cuts. It was suggested to apply methods of the theory of information to model complex processes of rock destruction and rock/tool interaction.
