5|$|Brachytherapy {{for skin}} cancer {{may result in}} a {{shedding}} of the outer layers of skin (<b>desquamation)</b> around the area of treatment in the weeks following therapy, which typically heals in 5–8 weeks. If the cancer is located on the lip, ulceration may occur as a result of brachytherapy, but usually resolves after 4–6 weeks.|$|E
25|$|Common {{symptoms}} of mercury poisoning include peripheral neuropathy, presenting as paresthesia or itching, burning, pain, {{or even a}} sensation that resembles small insects crawling on or under the skin (formication); skin discoloration (pink cheeks, fingertips and toes); swelling; and <b>desquamation</b> (shedding or peeling of skin).|$|E
25|$|The dry {{gangrene}} is {{a result}} of vasoconstriction induced by the ergotamine-ergocristine alkaloids of the fungus. It affects the more poorly vascularized distal structures, such as the fingers and toes. Symptoms include <b>desquamation</b> or peeling, weak peripheral pulses, loss of peripheral sensation, edema and ultimately the death and loss of affected tissues. Vasoconstriction is treated with vasodilators.|$|E
25|$|High-frequency {{treatment}} uses low-current high-frequency alternating currents, delivered via a glass electrode. Because {{the high}} frequency current converts {{some of the}} oxygen in the air into ozone, the treatment has a germicidal action, and is also drying and warming. Consequently, the treatment is used to aid healing and also to help <b>desquamation</b> (the skin's natural exfoliation) and stimulate sweat and sebaceous glands.|$|E
25|$|New {{infectious}} progeny virus are {{assembled in}} the cell nucleus. Papillomaviruses have evolved a mechanism for releasing virions into the environment. Other kinds of non-enveloped animal viruses utilize an active lytic process to kill the host cell, allowing release of progeny virus particles. Often this lytic process is associated with inflammation, which might trigger immune attack against the virus. Papillomaviruses exploit <b>desquamation</b> as a stealthy, non-inflammatory release mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Keratinocytes in the stratum basale proliferate through mitosis and the {{daughter}} cells move up the strata changing shape and composition as they undergo multiple stages of cell differentiation to eventually become anucleated. During that process, keratinocytes will become highly organized, forming cellular junctions (desmosomes) between each other and secreting keratin proteins and lipids which contribute {{to the formation of}} an extracellular matrix and provide mechanical strength to the skin. Keratinocytes from the stratum corneum are eventually shed from the surface (<b>desquamation).</b>|$|E
25|$|Treatment is by reassurance, as the {{condition}} is benign, and then by correction of any predisposing factors. This may be cessation of smoking or cessation/substitution of implicated medications or mouthwashes. Generally direct measures to return the tongue to its normal appearance involve improving oral hygiene, especially scraping or brushing the tongue before sleep. This promotes <b>desquamation</b> of the hyperparakeratotic papillae. Keratolytic agents (chemicals to remove keratin) such as podophyllin are successful, but carry safety concerns. Other reported successful measures include sodium bicarbonate mouthrinses, eating pineapple, sucking on a peach stone and chewing gum.|$|E
25|$|Epithelial {{surfaces}} may sustain {{damage from}} radiation therapy. Depending {{on the area}} being treated, this may include the skin, oral mucosa, pharyngeal, bowel mucosa and ureter. The rates of onset of damage and recovery from it depend upon the turnover rate of epithelial cells. Typically the skin starts to become pink and sore several weeks into treatment. The reaction may become more severe during the treatment and {{for up to about}} one week following the end of radiation therapy, and the skin may break down. Although this moist <b>desquamation</b> is uncomfortable, recovery is usually quick. Skin reactions tend to be worse in areas where there are natural folds in the skin, such as underneath the female breast, behind the ear, and in the groin.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} uncertain, {{but it is}} thought to be caused by {{accumulation}} of epithelial squames and proliferation of chromogenic (i.e., color-producing) microorganisms. There may be an increase in keratin production or a decrease in normal <b>desquamation</b> (shedding of surface epithelial cells). Many people with BHT are heavy smokers. Other possible associated factors are poor oral hygiene, general debilitation, hyposalivation (i.e., decreased salivary flow rate), radiotherapy, overgrowth of fungal or bacterial organisms, and a soft diet. Occasionally, BHT may be caused by the use of antimicrobial medications (e.g., tetracyclines), or oxidizing mouthwashes or antacids. A soft diet may be involved as normally food has an abrasive action on the tongue, which keeps the filiform papillae short. Pellagra, a condition caused by a vitamin deficiency, may cause a thick greyish fur to develop on the dorsal tongue, along with other oral signs.|$|E
25|$|Anatomical {{barriers}} include physical, {{chemical and}} biological barriers. The epithelial surfaces form a physical barrier that is impermeable to most infectious agents, acting as {{the first line of}} defense against invading organisms. <b>Desquamation</b> (shedding) of skin epithelium also helps remove bacteria and other infectious agents that have adhered to the epithelial surfaces. Lack of blood vessels and inability of the epidermis to retain moisture, presence of sebaceous glands in the dermis provides an environment unsuitable for the survival of microbes. In the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract, movement due to peristalsis or cilia, respectively, helps remove infectious agents. Also, mucus traps infectious agents. The gut flora can prevent the colonization of pathogenic bacteria by secreting toxic substances or by competing with pathogenic bacteria for nutrients or attachment to cell surfaces. The flushing action of tears and saliva helps prevent infection of the eyes and mouth.|$|E
25|$|Cutaneous {{radiation}} syndrome (CRS) {{refers to the}} skin symptoms of radiation exposure. Within {{a few hours after}} irradiation, a transient and inconsistent redness (associated with itching) can occur. Then, a latent phase may occur and last from a few days up to several weeks, when intense reddening, blistering, and ulceration of the irradiated site are visible. In most cases, healing occurs by regenerative means; however, very large skin doses can cause permanent hair loss, damaged sebaceous and sweat glands, atrophy, fibrosis (mostly Keloids), decreased or increased skin pigmentation, and ulceration or necrosis of the exposed tissue. Notably, as seen at Chernobyl, when skin is irradiated with high energy beta particles, moist <b>desquamation</b> (peeling of skin) and similar early effects can heal, only to be followed by the collapse of the dermal vascular system after two months, resulting in the loss of the full thickness of the exposed skin. This effect had been demonstrated previously with pig skin using high energy beta sources at the Churchill Hospital Research Institute, in Oxford.|$|E

2500|$|The {{epidermis}} {{contains no}} blood vessels, and {{cells in the}} deepest layers are nourished almost exclusively by diffused oxygen from the surrounding air and to a far lesser degree by blood capillaries extending to the outer layers of the dermis. The main type of cells which make up the epidermis are Merkel cells, keratinocytes, with melanocytes and Langerhans cells also present. The epidermis can be further subdivided into the following strata (beginning with the outermost layer): corneum, lucidum (only in palms of hands and bottoms of feet), granulosum, spinosum, basale. Cells are formed through mitosis at the basale layer. The daughter cells (see cell division) move up the strata changing shape and composition as they die due to isolation from their blood source. The cytoplasm is released and the protein keratin is inserted. They eventually reach the corneum and slough off (<b>desquamation).</b> This process is called [...] "keratinization". This keratinized layer of skin is responsible for keeping water {{in the body and}} keeping other harmful chemicals and pathogens out, making skin a natural barrier to infection.|$|E
5000|$|Normal, nonpathologic <b>desquamation</b> of {{the skin}} occurs when keratinocytes, after moving {{typically}} over about 14 days, are individually shed unnoticeably. In pathologic <b>desquamation,</b> such as that seen in X-linked ichthyosis, the stratum corneum becomes thicker (hyperkeratosis), imparting a [...] "dry" [...] or scaly appearance to the skin, and instead of detaching as single cells, corneocytes are shed in clusters, forming visible scales. <b>Desquamation</b> of the epidermis may result from disease or injury {{of the skin}}. For example, once the rash of measles fades, there is <b>desquamation.</b> Skin peeling typically follows healing of a first degree burn or sunburn. Toxic shock syndrome, a potentially fatal immune system reaction to a bacterial infection such as Staphylococcus aureus, can cause severe desquamation; so can mercury poisoning. Other serious skin diseases involving extreme <b>desquamation</b> include Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Radiation can cause dry or moist <b>desquamation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Both KLK5 and KLK14, other skin-expressed proteases, also cleave corneodesmosomal proteins. KLK5 is able {{to undergo}} autoactivation, as well as {{activating}} KLK7 and KLK14, suggesting a KLK skin cascade is responsible for coordinating <b>desquamation.</b>|$|E
