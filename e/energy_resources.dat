40|$|Abstract. An {{investment}} {{model for}} <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> system of China is established in this paper. Through analyzing the dynamics behavior of this model, {{the relationship between}} the capital investment in <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> system and the <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> supply in China has been investigated. The model reveals that there are certain boundaries which restrict the capital investment in energy system, namely, too high investment will lead <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> supply to increase dramatically, too low investment will cause <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> supply shrink. In order to keep the energy system of China away from chaos, corresponding countermeasures for <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> development are also put forward in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The paper evaluates {{effects of}} <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> {{development}} within the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) on energy supply mix, energy system cost, energy security and environment during 2000 - 2035. A MARKAL-based {{integrated energy system}} model of the five GMS countries was developed to examine benefits of regional <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> development for meeting the energy demand of these countries. The study found that an unrestricted <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> development and trade within the region would reduce the total-regional energy systems cost by 18 % and would abate the total CO 2 emission by 5 % {{as compared to the}} base case. All the five countries except Myanmar would benefit from the expansion of regional <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> integration in terms of lower energy systems costs and better environmental qualities. An imposition of CO 2 emission reduction constraint by 5 % on each of the study countries from that of the corresponding emissions under the unrestricted <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> development in the GMS is found to improve energy security, reduce energy import and fossil fuels dependences and increase volume of power trade within the region. The total energy system cost under the joint CO 2 emission reduction strategy would be less costly than that under the individual emission targets set for each country.

40|$|Abstract—Real-time and {{decentralized}} <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> allocation {{has become}} the main feature to develop {{for the next generation}} energy management system (EMS). In this paper, a minority game (MG) -based EMS (MG-EMS) is proposed for smart buildings with hybrid energy sources: main <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> from electrical power-grid and renewable <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> from solar photovoltaic (PV) cells. Compared to the traditional static and centralized EMS (SC-EMS), and the recent multi-agent-based EMS (MA-EMS) based on price-demand competition, our proposed MG-EMS can achieve up to 51 x and 147 x utilization rate improvements respectively regarding to the fairness of solar <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> allocation. In addition, the proposed MG-EMS can also reduce peak energy demand for main power-grid by 30. 6 %. As such, one can significantly reduce the cost and improve the stability of micro-grid of smart buildings with a high utilization rate of solar energy. I...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Mainland, most of the islands are in two groups, the North and South Isles, {{all of which have}} an underlying geological base of Old Red Sandstone. The climate is mild and the soils are extremely fertile, most of the land being farmed. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy. The significant wind and marine <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> are of growing importance, and the island generates more than its total yearly electricity demand using renewables.

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{reserves}} of crude oil are non-commercial, Jordan has the 5th largest oil-shale reserves in the world, which could be commercially exploited in the central and northwestern regions of the country. Official figures estimate the kingdom's oil shale reserves at more than 70 billion tonnes. Attarat Power Plant, which will start construction in late 2017, is a $2.2 billion oil shale-dependent power plant that will be completed in 2020 with a total capacity of 470 megawatts. The project {{is part of the}} kingdom's visionary plan that aims to diversify its <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> by 2025.

5|$|In October 2005, Gordon and Levin {{met with}} Warner Bros. {{to develop the}} film there again. Impressed with Zack Snyder's work on 300, Warner Bros. {{approached}} him to direct an adaptation of Watchmen. Screenwriter Alex Tse drew from his favorite elements of Hayter's script, but also returned it to the original Cold War setting of the Watchmen comic. Similar to his approach to 300, Snyder used the comic book panel-grid as a storyboard and opted to shoot the entire film using live-action sets instead of green screens. He extended the fight scenes, and added a subplot about <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> to make the film more topical. Although he intended to stay faithful to {{the look of the}} characters in the comic, Snyder intended Nite Owl to look scarier, and made Ozymandias' armor into a parody of the rubber muscle suits from the 1997 superhero film Batman & Robin. After the trailer to the film premiered in July 2008, DC Comics president Paul Levitz said that the company had to print more than 900,000 copies of Watchmen trade collection to meet the additional demand for the book that the advertising campaign had generated, with the total annual print run expected to be over one million copies. While 20th Century Fox filed a lawsuit to block the film's release, the studios eventually settled, with Warner agreeing to give Fox 8.5 percent of the film's worldwide gross, including from sequels and spin-offs in return. The film was released to theaters in March 2009.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} {{to the position of}} Solow and Stiglitz, Georgescu argues that neoclassical economists generally fail to realise the important difference between material resources and <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> in the economic process. This is where his flow-fund model of production comes into play (see above). Georgescu's point is that only material resources can be transformed into man-made capital. <b>Energy</b> <b>resources,</b> on the other hand, cannot be so transformed, as it is physically impossible to turn energy into matter, and matter is what man-made capital is made up of physically. The only possible role to be performed by <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> is to assist — usually as fuel or electricity — in the process of transforming material resources into man-made capital. In Georgescu's own terminology, energy may have the form of either a stock factor (mineral deposits in nature), or a flow factor (resources transformed in the economy); but never that of a fund factor (man-made capital in the economy). Hence, substituting man-made capital for <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> is physically impossible.|$|E
