5|$|Giraffe groups {{tend to be}} sex-segregated {{although}} mixed-sex groups made {{of adult}} females and young males are known to occur. Particularity stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young, which can last weeks or months. Social cohesion in these groups is maintained by the bonds formed between calves. Female association appears {{to be based on}} space-use and individuals may be matrilineally related. In general, females are more selective than males <b>in</b> <b>who</b> they associate with in regards to individuals of the same sex. Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges. Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that they normally frequent.|$|E

5|$|In some instances, the {{automotive}} industry and others were directly responsible for the decline of public transportation. The Great American streetcar scandal saw GM, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, Mack Trucks and other companies purchase a number of streetcars and electric trains in the 1930s and 1940s, such that 90percent of city trolleys had been dismantled by 1950. It was argued {{that this was a}} deliberate destruction of streetcars {{as part of a larger}} strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency. In United States v. National City Lines, Inc., many were found guilty of antitrust violations. The story has been explored several times in print, film and other media, for example <b>in</b> <b>Who</b> Framed Roger Rabbit, Taken for a Ride and The End of Suburbia.|$|E

5|$|John's {{attempt to}} impose de Gray's {{election}} as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 {{was the beginning}} of the king's long quarrel with Pope Innocent III. After Hubert Walter's death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be, something that commonly happened with elections to Canterbury. John postponed a decision while delegations from the bishops of England and the monks of the cathedral chapter went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope. The bishops of the province of Canterbury claimed the right to a say <b>in</b> <b>who</b> was elected, as whoever was chosen would be their superior, but according to canon law the monks of the cathedral chapter had the right to elect the new archbishop. The king also had a say in the election, as the archbishop was a major tenant-in-chief and was traditionally one of the principal royal advisers.|$|E
5|$|Lauren is interrogated by Mulder and Scully, {{and the two}} unknown {{agents that}} called them <b>in,</b> <b>who</b> say they are {{involved}} because they believe Graves and Dorlund's company sold technology to the Isfahan. Lauren admits to Mulder and Scully that the sales did indeed take place and that she believes Dorlund had Graves killed. After hearing Lauren recount the eerie circumstances that she believes are being caused by Graves' spirit, Scully - the usually reserved skeptic - readily accepts her story. Mulder is confused but, after Lauren leaves, Scully admits she was just humoring her. The agents search the company's premises, but are unable to find any evidence. When Dorlund attacks Lauren with a letter opener Graves' spirit takes it and cuts open the wallpaper, revealing a disc with evidence. Weeks later, Lauren starts her new job, {{but it appears that}} Graves' spirit may have followed her there.|$|E

5|$|McCreary's senate {{term was}} set to expire in 1908, {{the same year as}} Beckham's second term as governor. Desiring {{election}} to the Senate following his gubernatorial term, Beckham persuaded his Democratic allies to choose the party's nominees for governor and senator by a primary election held in 1906 – a year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. This ensured that the primary would occur during his term as governor, when he still wielded significant influence within the party. McCreary now allied himself with J. C. S. Blackburn, Henry Watterson, and other Beckham opponents, and sought to defend his seat in the primary. During the primary campaign, he pointed to his record of dealing with national issues, contrasting it with Beckham's youth and inexperience at the national level. Beckham countered by citing his strong stand in favor of Prohibition, as opposed to McCreary's more moderate position, and by touting his support of a primary election instead of a nominating convention, which he said gave the voters a choice <b>in</b> <b>who</b> would represent them in the Senate. Ultimately, Beckham prevailed in the primary by an 11,000-vote margin, rendering McCreary a lame duck with two years still left in his term.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{is still}} in a dilemma <b>in</b> <b>who</b> to choose from between CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) and his high school {{sweetheart}} Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore). Avery decides not to be Jack's date to Cerie's wedding, and that while she is gone, Jack should think about whether or not he wants to be with her. As soon as Avery leaves, Nancy shows up at the 30 Rock building unannounced, and decides to spend the weekend with Jack. Liz tries {{to talk him out of}} going on a date with Nancy, after he asked her for advice. He decides to keep things platonic with Nancy, so that no problem ensues in his decision to choose between them, but Jack ends up sleeping with Nancy. The next morning, Nancy admits that the two spending the night together was a big deal, as Jack was the first man she slept with after her divorce. At Floyd's wedding, Jack tells Nancy about Avery, and as a result, Nancy threatens to leave him forever once the ceremony is over. While Liz gives a reading, Jack texts her to stall, resulting in Liz reading inappropriate scripture recitations at the wedding.|$|E
5|$|Urse {{arrived in}} England after Hastings, {{but it is}} unknown if his brother Robert arrived with him or separately. Urse was {{appointed}} Sheriff of Worcestershire some time after the Norman Conquest of England, probably in about 1069, part of the wholesale replacement of English royal officials with Norman and other immigrants {{that took place in}} the early part of William's reign. As sheriff, Urse was responsible for collecting taxes and forwarding them to the treasury, and was empowered to raise armies if rebellion or invasion threatened. The sheriff presided over the shire court, and was accountable for the shire's annual payments to the king. During the reigns of William the Conqueror and his sons, the office of sheriff was a powerful one, as it did not share power with any other official in the shire, unless there was an earl in overall control. Because of their control of the courts for the hundreds– which were subdivisions of the shire– sheriffs had opportunities for patronage and also had a large say <b>in</b> <b>who</b> became members of the hundred and shire court juries. The death of Edwin, Earl of Mercia, who held power in Worcestershire until his death in 1071 during a rebellion against William, allowed Urse to accumulate more authority in Worcestershire, as Edwin was the last Earl of Mercia.|$|E

The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky <b>in,</b> <b>who</b> will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.|$|E
5|$|With the {{emergence}} of trios (tag teams consisting of three people) such as Los Misioneros de la Muerte, Los Brazos and more, the six-man tag team match became increasingly popular in the early 1980s. Its popularity led to the trios format becoming the most prevalent match format in Lucha libre to this day. The popularity {{led to the creation}} of the first trios championship in Mexico when the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) created the UWA World Trios Championship in 1984. The Mexican National Trios Championship was created in 1985, at the request of Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL) and endorsed by the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission. The commission granted EMLL the rights to promote the championship, which meant that CMLL had control over the everyday use of the championship, determining which storylines the title wre being used <b>in,</b> <b>who</b> were allowed to challenge for the title and how to use it in a public relations sense. The Commission would oversee the rule and approves any championship change that EMLL proposed.|$|E
