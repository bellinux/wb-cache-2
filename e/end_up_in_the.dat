5|$|From 1964 to 1978, the Giants {{registered}} {{just two}} winning seasons and {{were unable to}} advance to the playoffs. During this period the team also traded away quarterback Fran Tarkenton, who would later lead the Minnesota Vikings to three Super Bowls and <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hall of Fame. This period was characterized by the front office's bad decisions in the college draft, several ill-advised trades, and the team's fans' growing disappointment. It was not until the 1980s that the Giants would develop a consistent playoff team.|$|E

5|$|Models by Julio Ángel Fernández {{suggest that}} the {{scattered}} disc, which is the main source for periodic comets in the Solar System, might also be the primary source for Oort cloud objects. According to the models, {{about half of the}} objects scattered travel outward toward the Oort cloud, whereas a quarter are shifted inward to Jupiter's orbit, and a quarter are ejected on hyperbolic orbits. The scattered disc might still be supplying the Oort cloud with material. A third of the scattered disc's population is likely to <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Oort cloud after 2.5billion years.|$|E

5|$|Several {{thousand}} years ago, the planet Cybertron was consumed by {{a civil war}} between the two Transformer factions, the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron. Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark, a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet, into space, but Megatron pursued it. Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle and froze, and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky. Witwicky inadvertently activated Megatron’s navigational system, which etched the AllSpark’s coordinates into his glasses. The glasses <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky. In the present, Sam buys his first car, a rusting Chevrolet Camaro, but discovers it has {{a life of its}} own.|$|E

5|$|In March 1979, when Gaven {{was twenty}} years old, {{she served as}} the {{replacement}} actress for the character Betty Rizzo in the original Broadway production of Grease. This was her Broadway debut. In late 1980, she was cast in the lead role of Janet in the musical The Rocky Horror Show that ran for six nights at Warner Theatre. It {{tells the story of}} a couple, Brad and Janet, who find themselves lost one night and <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory of an alien doctor. The cast, including Gaven, was praised by critics. In 1984, she played a Londoner in the revival of Oliver! at Broadway and was the understudy for the major role of Nancy. That same year, in the Broadway revival of Zorba, Gaven played the role of The Widow who is eventually stoned to death by the townspeople after being held responsible for the suicide of a young boy who fell in love with her. She then portrayed the character Luisa, the wife of an Italian film director, in a production of Nine at An Evening Dinner Theater in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Xander's dream {{begins when}} he wakes on Buffy's couch. After excusing himself {{to use the}} restroom, he finds himself the object of an {{attempted}} seduction by Joyce. In the restroom, he starts to unzip, then realizes that the bathroom {{is attached to a}} large white room with many men in white coats ready to observe and take notes on his performance. He then meets Buffy, Giles, and Spike in a playground; Spike – unaffected by daylight – tells him that Giles is going to teach him to be a Watcher, as Buffy plays in a sandbox. Xander then finds himself in an ice cream truck with Anya; Willow and Tara (wearing skimpy clothing and garish make-up) are in the back, and they invite him to join them. He tries to do so, only to <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basement where his parents allow him to live. He goes to the university and comes across Giles, who starts revealing the reason for the dream, but who suddenly switches to speaking in French. Xander next finds himself in a reenactment of the Apocalypse Now scene between a captive Captain Benjamin Willard and Colonel Walter Kurtz, with Principal Snyder as Kurtz. Throughout the sequence Xander finds himself in his basement again and again, chased by an unseen pursuer, who is revealed as the First Slayer when she tears his heart out.|$|E

25|$|Using PSORT II, {{there is}} a nuclear {{localization}} signal of PYKKKHL at 268aa.
