As the contending armies moved north into Flanders, the flat terrain and obstructed view, caused by the number of buildings, industrial concerns, tree foliage and field boundaries, forced changes in British artillery methods. Lack of observation was remedied in part by decentralising artillery to infantry brigades and by locating the guns in the front line but this made them more vulnerable and several batteries were overrun in the fighting between Arras and Ypres. Devolving control of the guns made concentrated artillery-fire difficult to arrange, because of a lack of field telephones and the obscuring of signal flags by mists and fog.|$|E

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen a virtual {{explosion}} of information about customers and their preferences. This information potentially allows companies to increase their revenues, in particular since modern technology enables price changes to be effected at minimal cost. At the same time, companies have taken major strides in understanding and managing {{the dynamics of the}} supply chain, both their internal operations and their relationships with supply chain partners. These two developments are narrowly intertwined. Pricing decisions have a direct <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>operations</b> and visa versa. Yet, the systematic integration of operational and marketing insights is in an emerging stage, both in academia and in business practice. This article reviews a number of key linkages between pricing and operations. In particular, it highlights different drivers for dynamic pricing strategies. Through the discussion of key references and related software developments we aim to provide a snapshot into a rich and evolving field. supply chain management;inventory;capacity;dynamic pricing;operations-marketing interface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Cloud {{computing}} infrastructures leverage fault-tolerant and geographically distributed {{services in}} order to meet the requirements of modern applications. Each service deals with a large number of clients that compete for the resources it offers. When the load increases, the service needs to scale. In this paper, we investigate a scalability solution which consists in partitioning the service state. We formulate specific conditions under which a service is partitionable. Then, we present a general algorithm to build a dependable and consistent partitioned service. To assess the practicability of our approach, we implement and evaluate the ZooFence coordination service. ZooFence orchestrates several instances of ZooKeeper and presents the exact same API and semantics to its clients. It automatically splits the coordination service state among ZooKeeper instances while being transparent to the application. By reducing the convoy <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>operations</b> and leveraging the workload locality, our approach allows propos-ing a coordination service with a greater scalability than with a single ZooKeeper instance. The evaluation of ZooFence assesses this claim for two benchmarks, a synthetic service of concurrent queues and the BookKeeper distributed logging engine. I...|$|E
40|$|A team of {{consultants}} undertook reengineering {{the delivery}} of compensation and benefits at a large quasi-governmental agency. Benefits included six programs which accounted for several time intensive processes such as “cafeteria plan ” options for individual and family health coverage, a health benefits open enrollment period where information is dispersed to assist employees in plan selection; thrift spending account; and retirement accounts. In addition to the benefits portion, a myriad of compensation programs existed. Many of these hadn't been used in years, although available to all employment levels in the agency. In all, thirteen programs were to be reengineered in a twelve week period. A complicating factor was {{the structure of the}} organization. The organization included five senior vice presidencies, ten area vice presidents, eighty-five district managers, and many more levels of functional managers. The many levels and sheer number of vice presidents created overlapping spans of control stretching across the agency’s domain with regard to people management, resulting in a negative <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>operations.</b> Notwithstanding some of these factors that were outside the dominion of the reengineering team, the team created its own set of obstacles.
