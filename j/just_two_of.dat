5|$|Gleason is {{also the}} namesake of the Gleason polynomials, a system of polynomials that {{generate}} the weight enumerators of linear codes. These polynomials take a particularly simple form for self-dual codes: in this case there are <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> them, the two bivariate polynomials x2+y2 and x8+14x2y2+y8. Gleason's student Jessie MacWilliams continued Gleason's work in this area, proving {{a relationship between the}} weight enumerators of codes and their duals that has become known as the MacWilliams identity.|$|E
5|$|Curling {{events at}} the 2010 Winter Olympics were {{in the form of}} a {{round-robin}} tournament; each nation played all others in a group stage with the top four qualifying for medal playoffs. The men's team, the reigning world champions, won group stage games against France, Denmark, China, United States and Germany. These five wins left them in a tie for the last semifinal place with Sweden, who beat them in their group game. A single tie-breaker match was played between the two sides which was won by the Swedes in the first extra end. The women's team, skippered by 19-year-old Eve Muirhead, entered the tournament ranked seventh in the world and beat world champions China in their opening match, but won <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> their remaining eight games to finish seventh in the group and miss out on the semifinals.|$|E

In September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire, initiating the Italo-Turkish War. At the start of the war, Muin-i Zafer was stationed as a guard ship in Beirut. She left shortly after the onset of hostilities, however, and on 30 September arrived in Port Said at the northern end of the Suez Canal. There, she was disarmed and her guns were taken ashore to strengthen the local defenses. By the start of the First Balkan War in October 1912, Muin-i Zafer had been moved back to İzmir. In 1913, she became a torpedo training ship based in Constantinople. The ship was converted into a floating barracks in 1920 stationed in İzmit. In 1928, the vessel was converted again, into a depot ship for submarines at Erdek. She served in that capacity for four years before being decommissioned in 1932; she was broken up for scrap in 1934.|$|E

25|$|The {{organisation}} commenced {{operations in}} approximately 1950 and was formed as {{an amalgam of}} a number of ex-servicemen's organisations which had sprung up after soldiers, sailors and airmen had been 'demobbed' following service during the Emergency. The emergency spanned the period 1939 to 1946 which was approximately the same period as the Second World War and over 140,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, police and red cross personnel served in the Irish Defence Forces at this time. The National Federation of Irish Ex-Servicemen and the Association of Regular Ex-Servicemen (Defence Forces) being <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the organisations that came together.

25|$|Brentford's form deserted them in {{the wake}} of the FA Cup exit, winning <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the {{remaining}} 14 league matches of the season. Centre half Ron Greenwood was bought from Bradford Park Avenue for £9,000 in February, with all of the money being recouped following the sale of captain Jack Chisholm to Sheffield United for £16,000 a month later. Advanced preparations for the 1949–50 season continued in April, with the £7,000 purchase of Jackie Goodwin and Wally Quinton from Birmingham City. Brentford slumped to an 18th-place finish, just one point above 21st-place Nottingham Forest. Young forward Billy Dare was blooded in the final two months of the season and showed promise for the future with four goals in the final six matches.|$|E

25|$|Production was {{intended}} to be on a very large scale – an initial order for 500 aircraft was placed with Sopwith on 18 June, followed by additional orders with Wolseley Motors, the Air Navigation Co., Glendower Aircraft, Palladium Motors and the National Aircraft Factory No. 1. A total of 1,400 Salamanders were ordered. Production was slowed, however, by problems producing the armour plate, this being prone to distortion during the hardening process, and shortages of the BR.2 engine. By the end of October 1918 only 37 Salamanders were on RAF charge, and <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> these were in France. The first Salamander-equipped squadron, 157 Squadron, was due to fly out to France with 24 aircraft on 21 November, with more squadrons in the process of forming in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The 2001–02 season saw {{continued}} investment: Robbie Fowler and Seth Johnson {{signed for}} a combined £20 million. Leeds began the season brightly, losing <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> their opening 21 matches, and they topped {{the table on}} New Year's Day 2002. However, they then failed to win a league match for two months, a run which included a dismal 4–0 home defeat to Liverpool, and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Second Division Cardiff City. Leeds ultimately finished 5th, thus missing out on qualification for the UEFA Champions League. O'Leary was sacked {{at the end of}} the season; the reasons given were that despite heavy investment in the squad, Leeds had failed to qualify for the Champions League for two consecutive seasons, and there were also reports that O'Leary had lost the confidence of some of the players. In four seasons as manager, O'Leary had guided Leeds to four consecutive top five finishes and two European semi-finals.|$|E
