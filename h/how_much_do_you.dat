[...] It is, rather, a matter of learning to listen– really, listen– to everyone in the circle of humanity, and to take their insights into account.

500|$|The {{ownership}} of Chelsea by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich also caused friction between both clubs. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger said in May 2005: [...] "They are a financially doped club. They have enhancement of performances through financial resources which are unlimited. For me, it's {{a kind of}} doping because it's {{not in any way}} linked to their resources. It puts pressure on the market that is not very healthy. They can go to Steven Gerrard or Rio Ferdinand and 'say <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> earn, we'll give you twice as much.'" [...] Wenger admitted this put Arsenal at a disadvantage in the transfer market; in the case of Shaun Wright-Phillips, a long-term target, Chelsea's interest meant Arsenal needed to wait before making a bid. The player eventually joined Chelsea from Manchester City for £21 million.|$|E

He said: [...] "At <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> sell that honey?" [...] (4) The seller said to him: [...] "Just taste it, and if it pleases you, you can make a bid."

When? Are you waiting for some miracle? The miracle will be when you demand of yourself everything you've got of yourself. That'll be the day.

You don't piddle with music—it's a good-time-Charlie business, and for me, the wonderful good times come out of hearing somebody play beautifully. I don't care if it's ‘Stars and Stripes,’ ‘The Victors’ or what it is. I mean, there's a pride. And this guy knows he's good! And nobody can take that away from him.
