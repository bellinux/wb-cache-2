5|$|Given Intel's {{history of}} {{disclosing}} details about Itanium microprocessors at ISSCC, this paper most likely refers to Poulson.

40|$|By {{analyzing}} {{the configuration of}} a 6 R manipulator based on global performance index, the problem is proposed in this paper. The performances of two configurations cannot be compared based on the global performance index, if the configurations have same index. To solve the problem, an <b>improved</b> <b>performance</b> index is proposed in this paper. Firstly, this paper points out the boundary distribution index (BDI) based {{on the distribution of}} the singular points in the workspace. Secondly, the effectiveness of BDI is verified by comparing with the existing performance index. In addition, an <b>improved</b> <b>performance</b> index is established with the combination of the existing performance index and BDI. Then, the effect of offset on the manipulator is analyzed based on the <b>improved</b> <b>performance</b> index. Finally, the optimized configuration is obtained by the <b>improved</b> <b>performance</b> index and contrasts with other configuration. Then, the effectiveness of the <b>improved</b> <b>performance</b> index is verified...|$|R

5|$|A popular {{approach}} to <b>improve</b> <b>performance</b> {{is to create}} a memory pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating memory every time an item is inserted or removed from a container, a large block of memory (the memory pool) is allocated beforehand, possibly at the startup of the program. The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer to memory from the pool. Actual deallocation of memory can be deferred until the lifetime of the memory pool ends. An example of memory pool-based allocators {{can be found in the}} Boost C++ Libraries.|$|E
5|$|The coil of the {{transducer}} adds some inductance on {{the electrical}} {{side of the}} filter. It is common practice to add a capacitor in parallel with the coil so that an additional resonator is formed which {{can be incorporated into}} the filter design. While this will not <b>improve</b> <b>performance</b> to the extent that an additional mechanical resonator would, there is some benefit and the coil has to be there in any case.|$|E
5|$|The {{technology}} utilized on Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie grid {{also came}} under fire from critics. It is claimed that this technology, used to <b>improve</b> <b>performance,</b> safety, and reliability, made people in Quebec over-dependent on the power grid for their energy needs, since electricity, especially hydroelectric power, makes up over 40% of Quebec's energy supply. This dependence, evidenced by the fact Ontario farmers had more backup generators than farmers in Quebec, can increase {{the severity of the}} consequences when the grid fails, as it did in January 1998.|$|E

5|$|As the {{aircraft}} aged, the avionics {{were viewed as}} lacking suitable components for the ground attack mission, such as terrain-following radar, GPS navigation or modern night-flight systems; consequently, several upgrades were {{carried out in the}} mid-1990s, including the addition of the Litening targeting pod. India placed an order for 17 additional upgraded Jaguar aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics in 1999 and a further 20 in 2001–2002. The Indian Air Force plans to upgrade up to 125 Jaguars starting in 2013 by upgrading the avionics (including multi mode radar, auto-pilot and other changes) as part of the DARIN III programme and is considering fitting more powerful engines, Honeywell F125IN to <b>improve</b> <b>performance,</b> particularly at medium altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{modified}} extensively {{in an attempt}} to rectify their machinery problems. All three ships had their propeller shafts lengthened, and their original bronze screws were replaced with larger steel propellers, though this did not <b>improve</b> <b>performance.</b> Sebenico received the most radical alteration; her stern was lengthened slightly to allow for finer hull lines, which would improve her hydrodynamic shape, though this too failed to provide a significantly higher speed. As a result of her different hull, Sebenico is sometimes not included in the Zara class. Between 1898 and 1901, all four ships were re-boilered.|$|E
5|$|R.C. Pro-Am is {{a racing}} video game {{developed}} by Rare. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) by Nintendo for North America in March 1988, {{and then in}} Europe on April 15 of the same year. Presented in an overhead isometric perspective, a single player races a radio-controlled car around a series of tracks. The objective of each track is {{to qualify for the}} next race by placing in the top three racers. Players collect items to <b>improve</b> <b>performance,</b> and they must avoid a variety of hazards such as rain puddles and oil slicks. It {{is an example of a}} racing game which features vehicular combat, in which racers can use missiles and bombs to temporarily disable opposing vehicles. Originally titled Pro Am Racing, R.C. Pro-Am was also ported to the Sega Genesis in 1992 as Championship Pro-Am, an enhanced remake with enhanced graphics and additional features. R.C. Pro-Am was followed by two sequels: Super R.C. Pro-Am in 1991, and R.C. Pro-Am II in 1992.|$|E
