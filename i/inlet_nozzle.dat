The gas release {{that led to}} the fire was caused by the failure of a heat exchanger (cold box) <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> in the liquids recovery plant. The failure of the <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> was due to liquid metal embrittlement of the train B aluminium cold box by elemental mercury.|$|E

The collection efficiency for small particles is correspondingly lower than in more energy-intensive devices.

40|$|The {{development}} of the swirling flame flow field and gasification/ combustion dynamics at thermo-chemical conversion of biomass pellets has experimentally been studied using a pilot device, which combines a biomass gasifier and combustor by varying the inlet conditions of the fuel-air mixture into the combustor. Experimental modelling {{of the formation of}} the cold nonreacting swirling airflow field above the <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> of the combustor and the upstream flow formation below the <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> has been carried out to assess the influence of the <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> diameter, as well primary and secondary air supply rates on the upstream flow formation and air swirl intensity, which is highly responsible for the formation of fuel-air mixture entering the combustor and the {{development of}} combustion dynamics downstream of the combustor. The research results demonstrate that at equal primary axial and secondary swirling air supply into the device a decrease in the <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> diameter enhances the upstream air swirl formation by increasing swirl intensity below the <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> of the combustor. This leads to the enhanced mixing of the combustible volatiles with the air swirl below the <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> of the combustor providing a more complete combustion of volatiles and an increase in the heat output of the device...|$|E

40|$|AbstractInlet {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{elements}} of squirrel cage fan that can have great effect on performance and losses, especially between <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> exit and first section of impeller width. But, enough research has not been done on its parameters. In this paper the effect of axial gap between <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> and impeller on performance and flow pattern is considered. Four <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> sizes with respect to impeller size (two smaller, nearly same and bigger than inner impeller diameter) and three axial gaps within the physical dimensions of the casing and impeller were chosen. Numerical simulations with different turbulence models, special geometry and mesh pattern were performed to find the effect of this axial gap on flow pattern, performance and efficiency. For the validation of numerical results, some experiments were done and all the performance parameters were compared with that of numerical simulations. These results show good matching between experimental and numerical results. From the simulation of each case study, flow pattern and its mechanism and the causes affecting the efficiency and performance due to axial gap are analyzed and presented...|$|E

The purpose of the analysis was {{to point out the}} impact on the metrological characteristics of the air gauge. In particular, attention was paid to the airflow through the measuring slot. Here, the complex phenomena take place, among others the supersonic areas and a “bubble ring,” which cause discontinuity and hysteresis in the static characteristic. On the other hand, the air stream expansion after the restriction (<b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle)</b> is observed in the measuring chamber.

Around this time, the Whittle W.2B was developing 1,600 lbf (7.11 kN). However, the F.2 engine suffered from a number of problems that cast doubts on its reliability. These were primarily due to hot spots building up on the turbine bearing and combustion chamber. The latter, in turn, caused warping and fractures of the turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzles.</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{is fixed}} at a tangent {{to the main}} tube which causes the {{entering}} air to acquire the vortical motion which gives the device its name. At {{one side of the}} <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> is a fixed flow restriction called the 'cold orifice,' and at the other of the main tube there is a variable flow restriction called the 'hot valve. ' These names derived from the essence of the Vortex tube, namely, that the air leaving the tube through the orifice is colder than the entering air while the air leaving through the valve is hotter. The degree of heating and cooling depends upon the relative amount of the air leaving each end of the tube. The Vortex tube was first discovered by G. J. Ranque, 1931. The following several years, the research was performed, but it was given up until Hilsch rediscovered it. Hilsch had begun his investigation on the Vortex tube 1944 after reading Ranques paper, Interest in the Vortex tube has increased high, and many researches have been done untill now. Recently...|$|E

40|$|The {{vortex tube}} or Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube is {{a device that}} enables the {{separation}} of hot and cold air as compressed air flows tangentially into the vortex chamber through <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Separating cold and hot airs by using {{the principles of the}} vortex tube can be applied to industrial applications such as cooling equipment in CNC machines, refrigerators, cooling suits, heating processes, etc. The vortex tube is well-suited for these applications because it is simple, compact, light, quiet, and does not use Freon or other refrigerants (CFCs/HCFCs). It has no moving parts and does not break or wear and therefore requires little maintenance. Thus, this paper presents an overview of the phenomena occurring inside the vortex tube during the temperature/energy separation on both the counter flow and parallel flow types. The paper also reviews the experiments and the calculations presented in previous studies on temperature separation in the vortex tube. The experiment consisted of two important parameters, the first is the geometrical characteristics of the vortex tube (for example, the diameter and length of the hot and cold tubes, the diameter of the cold orifice, shape of the hot (divergent) tube, number of <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzles,</b> shape of the <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzles,</b> and shape of the cone valve. The second is focused on the thermo-physical parameters such as inlet gas pressure, cold mass fraction, moisture of inlet gas, and type of gas (air, oxygen, helium, and methane). For each parameter, the temperature separation mechanism and the flow-field inside the vortex tubes is explored by measuring the pressure, velocity, and temperature fields. The computation review is concentrated on the quantitative, theoretical, analytical, and numerical (finite volume method) aspects of the study. Although many experimental and numerical studies on the vortex tubes have been made, the physical behaviour of the flow is not fully understood due to its complexity and the lack of consistency in the experimental findings. Furthermore, several different hypotheses based on experimental, analytical, and numerical studies have been put forward to describe the thermal separation phenomenon.

40|$|A {{circulating}} bed particulate reactor was designed, developed, {{and demonstrated}} to facilitate recovery of dilute dissolved platinum species from concentrated aqueous iodide solutions, {{an essential component}} for the overall process proposed for the recovery of Pt from secondary materials using benign conditions. A detailed design for the reactor was undertaken using the Fluent™ computational fluid dynamics software to predict electrolyte and particulate flows, and Maple™ for simulating the electrochemical performance. Insight was gained into the design features required for successful operation and demonstrated in the reactor design, including effects of electrolyte flow rate, additional <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> locations, bed depth {{in the direction of}} current flow, draft tube width, and its proximity to the <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Good agreement was found between the reactor model predictions and the results of the experimental matrix conducted to define the reactor performance. The electrodeposit produced by the reactor was found to be adherent even under transport controlled operation, supporting the assertion that mechanical interactions in a circulating particulate bed can improve deposit morphologies in transport and mixed controlled deposition regimes. The model predictions and the experimental results both showed that the reactor could be operated with charge yields of ca. 45 %, corresponding to specific electrical energy consumptions of ca. 1. 0 kWh kg− 1 Pt and hence negligible operating cost compared with the value of the product...|$|E

The flow is assumed as an incompressible turbulent flow; the gradient of temperature is required at all the points of the heat exchanger.
