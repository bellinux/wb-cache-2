Post food {{reviewer}} Tom Sietsema, however, had little <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the entrees (nearly all of which he found disappointing) and the service (which he found to be tardy and focused more on getting customers to buy more food). The busy atmosphere, he argued, was not conducive to a positive dining experience. By contrast, the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington gave Old Ebbitt Grill its Visitors' Choice Award in 2011.|$|E

Towers, a {{daughter}} of Oliver Bixby, told the Boston Herald that her grandmother had [...] "great sympathy for the South" [...] and that her mother recalled that Bixby had been [...] "highly indignant" [...] about the letter with [...] "little <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> of President Lincoln". In 1949, Towers' nephew, Arthur March Bixby, claimed that Lydia Bixby had moved to Massachusetts from Richmond, Virginia; though this assertion is contradicted by contemporary records that list her birthplace as Rhode Island.|$|E

500|$|... "Funeral" [...] was {{met with}} a wide range of reviews, from highly {{enthusiastic}} to harshly critical. Lisa Respers France of CNN said it was [...] "one of the best episodes ever", and MTV's Aly Semigran called it [...] "authentic" [...] and [...] "one of the very best" [...] of the season if not the series as a whole. Robert Canning of IGN wrote that it was [...] "a great episode that truly showcased the talents of Jane Lynch" [...] and rated it 8.5 out of 10. Rolling Stone Erica Futterman said that the episode [...] "felt like a recycled version of things we've seen previously" [...] and added that the show is [...] "not as entertaining when it's simply a showcase". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a [...] "C" [...] and characterized the funeral scene as [...] "the highlight of an uneven episode". The Atlantic Kevin Fallon wrote, [...] "Killing off Sue's sister seemed cruel, but ultimately paid off—it's too bad the episode completely derailed afterward, dying its own rapid death in turn." [...] Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times had little <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and singled out the writers for doing [...] "such a crappy job" [...] on the penultimate episode of the season.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the first}} {{minutes of the}} drama, {{reactions}} on Twitter were mixed. Nicole Golden from TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.5 stars out of 5.0. She found that [...] "overall, the concept worked since music really has always played {{a big part in}} the show. Some songs were more appropriate and/or better performed than others, though." [...] She also wrote the concept worked in part because it was new but noted [...] "the format would probably not have the same effect if used in future episodes." [...] Even though Boston Heralds critic Mark Perigard was not a fan of the concept, saying [...] "the Grey's Anatomy event proved how tricky it is for an established show, especially a drama, to pull off a musical episode," [...] he did like several actors's performances. He wrote: [...] "Chandra Wilson and Chyler Leigh (whom I never have anything <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about) delivered some impressive vocal work. Eric Dane did some of his best acting of his career last night as an anxious father-to-be terrified he would lose his best friend." [...] Lyneka Little of The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "If Glee and ER had a baby it would be tonight’s episode of the medical drama Grey’s Anatomy titled “Song Beneath the Song.”" [...] In his review of the episode Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote [...] "Like Grey's Anatomy as a whole, some parts were unintentionally silly, others were surprisingly powerful, and it was rarely dull, at least." ...|$|E
500|$|Under Idaho law, conspirators were {{considered}} to be legally present {{at the scene of the}} crime. Using this provision, the local county prosecutor in Idaho drew up extradition papers for Haywood, Moyer, and George Pettibone which described them as having been physically present in Idaho at the time of the murder, which they were not. [...] McParland arrived in Denver on Thursday, February 15, and presented the extradition papers to Colorado Governor McDonald, who, by prior arrangement with the governor of Idaho, accepted them immediately. But Denver sheriff's deputies waited until Saturday evening to arrest Haywood, Pettigrew, and Moyer, then held the three in the Denver Jail, and refused requests by the three to contact lawyers and family. When reporters began asking questions at the Denver Jail, the three prisoners were secretly taken to the Oxford Hotel, where they were held overnight. Early Sunday morning the prisoners were put on a special train, and guarded by Colorado militia, were sped to Idaho. Unionists regarded the incident to be a kidnapping, to extradite them to Idaho before the courts in Denver could intervene. The events were so extraordinary that even American Federation of Labor president Samuel Gompers, who had little <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the WFM, directed his union to raise funds for the defense. However, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a habeas corpus appeal (George Pettibone v. Jasper C Nichols), ruling that the arrest and extradition were legal, with only Justice Joseph McKenna dissenting.|$|E

500|$|Friedman {{defended his}} {{activity}} in Chile {{on the grounds}} that, in his opinion, the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but {{also contributed to the}} amelioration of Pinochet's rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990. That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom, in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom. In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose, he said the following: [...] "Chile is not a politically free system, and I do not condone the system. But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role. ...The conditions {{of the people in the}} past few years has been getting better and not worse. They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system." [...] In 1984, Friedman stated that he has [...] "never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile." [...] In 1991 he said: [...] "I have nothing <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the political regime that Pinochet imposed. It was a terrible political regime. The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market. [...] In Chile, the drive for political freedom, that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success, ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy. Now, at long last, Chile has all three things: political freedom, human freedom and economic freedom. Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether, now that it has political freedom, that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom." [...] He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other socialist states.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were clearly}} gaps in Bede's knowledge, but Bede also says little on some topics {{that he must}} have been {{familiar}} with. [...] For example, although Bede recounts Wilfrid's missionary activities, he does not give a full account of his conflict with Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury, or his ambition and aristocratic lifestyle. [...] Only the existence of other sources such as the Life of Wilfrid make it clear what Bede discreetly avoids saying. [...] The omissions are not restricted to Wilfrid; Bede makes no mention at all of Boniface, though it is unlikely he knew little of him; and the final book contains less information about the church in his own day than could be expected. [...] A possible explanation for Bede's discretion may be found in his comment that one should not make public accusations against church figures, no matter what their sins; Bede may have found little <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the church in his day and hence preferred to keep silent. [...] It is clear that he did have fault to find; his letter to Ecgberht contains several criticisms of the church.|$|E

Though the lead actor Hrithik Roshan along with wife Sussanne Khan attended the special screening, Aishwarya Rai and her family were conspicuous by their absence.

2500|$|The Connecticut Court {{found the}} {{argument}} of the defendant-respondent to be exceptionally weak {{in terms of the}} law. [...] The idea that horse droppings abandoned along the road became a part of the real estate in fee is an interesting argument. But it was soundly rejected by the court. [...] Even following this theory, the borough of Stamford, Connecticut would have been the new best owners of the manure. [...] When the plaintiff-appellate began to rake the manure into neat piles for reclamation, he did it in clear sight of {{one or more of the}} officials of Stamford. [...] Also, presumably, any citizen of the town could have observed him. [...] No one objected to his activity, or came forward to claim superior rights to the manure. [...] The plaintiff had [...] "improved" [...] what was otherwise a nuisance to the town. [...] In this act, he also had some legal standing to claim a superior ownership to anyone else. [...] The existing laws allowing persons who piled up seaweed to have a legitimate claim of possession for 24 hours was invoked. [...] The court had nothing <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the defendant-respondent, stating he had not placed himself in an enviable light.|$|E

[...] Sputnikmusic was more negative, stating that [...] "Similarly, there was a time when All Time Low were a genuinely exciting young pop punk band; when the songs were dynamic and Alex Fucking Gaskarth's vocals were merely double-tracked rather than layered and autotuned to fuck." [...] idobi Radio also gave a negative review stating, [...] "The band lost their way... This experiment went wildly out of control. The album lacks overall direction and cohesiveness." [...] Review Rinse Repeat's review was mixed, noting that the record [...] "Overproduced and emotionally flat, there just isn't much <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about this album. Strange enough, All Time Low seem to be in a completely different world this time around, as tracks like [...] "Forget About It", [...] "Under a Paper Moon" [...] and [...] "I Feel Like Dancin'" [...] show with unneeded slickness, out-of-body songwriting (not in a good way) and underachieving vocals." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 2002, it was {{reported}} that Lucy Benjamin had quit her role of Lisa. She commented, [...] "I’ve had a wonderful five years and I’m terribly excited by the [...] storyline.” EastEnders executive producer Louise Berridge added, “This {{is going to be a}} very demanding story to play but I know Lucy will do a fabulous job. She’s an actress with a terrific future.” Despite initial claims that the actress had decided to leave, she later admitted that the producers had axed the character. Discussing Lisa's exit, Lucy Benjamin's boyfriend of the time, actor Steve McFadden who plays Phil Mitchell, said, [...] "Lucy didn’t feel comfortable with lying. There’s a stigma attached to being given the boot but she felt stupid pretending she’d decided to pack in a great job. It was hard for her and she was very upset but she’s come through it. I felt for her but soaps are led by storylines and Lucy was told that the writers had come up with a brilliant plot that was too <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no to.I guess Lucy’s character was so central to the plot that eventually it blew up in her face. I’m proud of the fact that she was good enough to come to the forefront of the show. Lucy did so well to make her mark on EastEnders in the first place because Lisa arrived on the Square on her own. She wasn’t part of a family, which means she was more vulnerable to the chop. She was only on a three-month contract but she made it a success and ended up being part of the cast for four years. If you are part of a screen family on EastEnders you are practically bomb-proof, no matter what your ability is as an actor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. His first record, the self-penned [...] "No Money in This Deal", was {{recorded}} on January 19, and appeared in February on Starday Records, beginning the singer's association with producer and mentor H.W. [...] "Pappy" [...] Daily. The song was actually cut in Starday Records' co-founder Jack Starnes' {{living room and}} produced by Starnes. Jones also worked at KTRM (now KZZB) in Beaumont around this time. [...] Deejay Gordon Baxter told Nick Tosches that Jones acquired the nickname [...] "possum" [...] while working there: [...] "One of the deejays there, Slim Watts, took to calling him George P. Willicker Picklepuss Possum Jones. [...] For one thing, he cut his hair short, like a possum's belly. [...] He had a possum's nose and stupid eyes, like a possum." [...] During his early recording sessions, Daily admonished Jones for attempting to sound too much like his heroes Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell. [...] In later years, Jones would have little <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the music production at Starday, recalling to NPR in 1996 that [...] "it was a terrible sound. [...] We recorded in a small living room of a house on a highway near Beaumont. [...] You could hear the trucks. [...] We had to stop {{a lot of times}} because it wasn't soundproof, it was just egg crates nailed on the wall and the big old semi trucks would go by and make a lot of noise and we'd have to start over again." [...] Jones' first hit came with [...] "Why Baby Why" [...] in 1955. [...] That same year, while touring as a cast member of the Louisiana Hayride, Jones met and played shows with Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. [...] "I didn't get to know him that well," [...] Jones said of Presley to Nick Tosches in 1994. [...] "He stayed pretty much with his friends around him in his dressing room. [...] Nobody seemed to get around him much any length of time to talk to him." [...] Jones would, however, remain a lifelong friend of Johnny Cash. [...] Jones was invited to sing at the Grand Ole Opry in 1956.|$|E
