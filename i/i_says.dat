Hugh of Lincoln, a contemporary and later canonised, {{is said to have}} asked forgiveness of God for not having rebuked Walter as often as he probably should have. Modern historians tend not to share the older view that Walter was {{the driving force behind the}} administrative changes during Richard's reign, that Richard was uninterested in government, and that he left all decisions in the hands of his ministers, especially Longchamp and Walter. The studies of James Holt and others have shown that Richard was highly involved in government decisions, and that it was more a partnership between the king and his ministers. Walter was, however, very innovative in his approach to government. Walter continued to enjoy the support of Richard's brother John, and it was during John's reign that a number of Walter's administrative reforms took place, although how much royal initiative was behind the innovations is unknown, given John's interest in government and administration.|$|E

2500|$|Eusebius, {{writing in}} the reign of Constantine <b>I</b> <b>says</b> he himself saw a pair of statues in bronze in Panease or Caesarea Philippi (on the Golan Heights in modern terms) of Jesus and the haemorrhoissa, {{sculpture}} being at this time an unusual form for the depiction of Jesus. [...] By his description they resembled a sculptural version of the couple as they were shown {{in a number of}} paintings in the Catacombs of Rome (see illustration at top). [...] He sees this in terms of ancient traditions of commemorating local notables rather than newer ones of Early Christian art. [...] The statues were placed outside the house of the woman, who came from the city, and was called Veronica (meaning [...] "true image"), according to the apocrypha Acts of Pilate and later tradition, which gave other details of her life.|$|E
2500|$|Drews {{thinks that}} we can go farther and ascribe the change to Pope Gelasius I (492-96). A very old {{tradition}} connects his name with at any rate, some important work about the Canon. The second oldest Roman sacramentary known, although it is really later than St. Gregory, has been called the [...] "Sacramentarium Gelasianum" [...] since the 9th century (Duchesne, Origines, 120). Gennadius <b>I</b> <b>says</b> that he composed a sacramentary (De. vir. ill., c. xciv). Moreover, the Liber Pontificalis refers to his liturgical work (Origines, 122) and the Stowe Missal (7th century) puts {{at the head of the}} Canon the title: [...] "Canon dominicus Papæ Gelasi" [...] (ed. Warren, 234). Baumer has collected all the evidences for Gelasius's authorship of some important sacramentary (Histor. Jahrb., 1893, 244 sqq.). It is known that Gelasius did not compose the text of the Canon. Its component parts have been traced back to a far earlier date. But would not so vital a change in its arrangement best explain the tradition that persistently connects the recent Canon with the name of Gelasius? ...|$|E
