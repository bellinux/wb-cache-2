40|$|Ferrite {{have found}} a variety of uses in {{electronic}} and communication engineering. Mn-Zn ferrites (Mn 1 -XZnxFe 2 O 4) are widely used as <b>filter</b> <b>core</b> materials over a range of frequencies varying from several hundred Hz to several MHz. There are many other applications such as in television receivers as deflection yokes and E. H. T. cores etc. The development of a ferrite suitable for a particular application is an interesting scientific problem and technological challenge. The properties of ferrites are determined {{by a number of}} intrinsic properties and their interaction with the ceramic microstructure. Impurities, present in or added to the raw materials used for processing ferrites, {{play an important role in}} determining the properties of the ferrites. The cost of ferrites is very much related to the purity level of the raw materials used. It is, therefore, both scientifically and economically important that the behaviour of ferrites is studied with additions of controlled amounts of impurities commonly present in the raw materials cheaply available. Silica (Si 0 2) is commonly found in the raw materials and is also, to some extent, contributed by atmospheric dust. In order to determine the tolerance of SiO 2 as an impurity in the raw materials and during processing, a systematic study has been carried out to investigate the effect of SiO 2 addition in the raw materials. The effect of controlled additions of oxides of germanium and tin to the raw materials has also been studied since Si, Ge and Sn are all elements of the IV group in the periodic table. The studies have been presented in five chapters. Chapter I gives the background essential for the present study. This chapter deals with the important properties of ferrites. The properties of ferrites can be classified in two categories. Firstly intrinsic properties i. e. those properties which are decided by the basic composition of the ferrite. Secondly extrinsic properties i. e. those properties which depend upon the microstructure and processing parameters. The literature presently available with special reference to impurities and their effect on the magnetic properties has also been discussed. The effect of impurities on the magnetic properties of ferrites depends upon whether they go in solid solution with the ferrite or stay insoluble. The nature of the three impurities - SiO 2, GeO 2 and SnO 2 in the ferrite has been studied in chapter II by employing scanning electron microscopy, X-ray and Auger microprobe and X-ray diffraction (lattice parameter measurement) techniques. Both. Si 0 2 and Ge 20 have been found to have a limited solubility in the ferrite and tend to segregate at the grain boundaries, Si 02 has been found to form a compound at the grain boundaries.
