5|$|Throughout the universe, {{hydrogen}} is mostly {{found in the}} atomic and plasma states, with properties quite {{different from those of}} molecular hydrogen. As a plasma, hydrogen's electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity and <b>high</b> <b>emissivity</b> (producing the light from the Sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind they interact with the Earth's magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora. Hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the interstellar medium. The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the Universe up to redshift z=4.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{pyrotechnic}} compositions, {{for example}} MTV, give a great flame emission upon combustion and yield a temperature-dependent signature {{and can be}} understood as gray bodies of <b>high</b> <b>emissivity</b> (~0.95). Such payloads are called blackbody payloads. Other payloads, like iron/potassium perchlorate pellets, only yield a low flame emission but also show temperature-dependent signature. Nevertheless, the lower combustion temperature as compared to MTV results in a lower amount of energy released in the short-wavelength IR range. Other blackbody payloads include ammonium perchlorate/anthracene/magnesium and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) binder.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of bare, polished metals, {{the appearance of a}} surface to the eye is not a good guide to emissivities near room temperature. Thus white paint absorbs very little visible light. However, at an infrared wavelength of 10x10−6 meters, paint absorbs light very well, and has a <b>high</b> <b>emissivity.</b> Similarly, pure water absorbs very little visible light, but water is nonetheless a strong infrared absorber and has a correspondingly <b>high</b> <b>emissivity.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Materials with <b>higher</b> <b>emissivity</b> {{appear to}} be hotter. In this thermal image, the ceramic {{cylinder}} appears to be hotter than its cubic container (made of silicon carbide), while in fact {{they have the same}} temperature.|$|R
50|$|The emissivity, {{reflectivity}} and absorptivity of a floor surface {{are critical}} determinants of its heat exchange with the occupants and room. Unpolished flooring surface materials and treatments have very <b>high</b> <b>emissivity’s</b> (0.85 to 0.95) and therefore make good heat radiators.|$|R
5|$|Currently, {{ytterbium}} {{is being}} investigated as a possible replacement for magnesium in high density pyrotechnic payloads for kinematic infrared decoy flares. As ytterbium(III) oxide has a significantly <b>higher</b> <b>emissivity</b> in the infrared range than magnesium oxide, a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium-based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV).|$|R
50|$|As lots {{of carbon}} and much heat is {{released}} upon combustion of MTV the combustion flame {{can be described}} as a grey body of <b>high</b> <b>emissivity.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A material's {{emissivity}} {{can range}} from a theoretical 0.00 (completely not-emitting) to an equally theoretical 1.00 (completely emitting). An example of a substance with low emissivity would be silver, with an emissivity coefficient of [...]02. An example of a substance with <b>high</b> <b>emissivity</b> would be asphalt, with an emissivity coefficient of [...]98.|$|E
50|$|Most {{surfaces}} have <b>high</b> <b>emissivity</b> (over 0.9), {{and most}} IR thermometers rely on this simplifying assumption; however, reflective surfaces have lower emissivity than non-reflective surfaces. Some sensors have an adjustable emissivity setting, {{which can be}} set to measure the temperature of reflective and non-reflective surfaces. A non-adjustable thermometer {{may be used to}} measure the temperature of a reflective surface by applying a non-reflective paint or tape, with some loss of accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Although {{ordinary}} black paint {{has high}} solar absorption, {{it also has}} <b>high</b> thermal <b>emissivity,</b> and thus {{it is not a}} selective surface.|$|R
50|$|Cool roofs combine high optical {{reflectance}} with <b>high</b> infrared <b>emissivity,</b> thereby simultaneously reducing heat transfer {{from the sun}} and increasing heat removal through radiation.|$|R
40|$|Basalt fibres are {{emerging}} as a replacement to E-glass fibres in polymer matrix composites for selected applications. In this study, the fire structural resistance of a basalt fibre composite is determined experimentally and analytically, and it is compared against an equivalent laminate reinforced with E-glass fibres. When exposed to the same radiant heat flux, the basalt fibre composite heated up more rapidly and reached higher temperatures than the glass fibre laminate due to its <b>higher</b> thermal <b>emissivity.</b> The tensile structural survivability of the basalt fibre composite was inferior to the glass fibre laminate when exposed to the same radiant heat flux. Tensile softening of both materials occurred by thermal softening and decomposition of the polymer matrix and weakening of the fibre reinforcement, which occur at similar rates. The inferior fire resistance of the basalt fibre composite is due mainly to <b>higher</b> <b>emissivity,</b> which causes it to become hotter in fire...|$|R
50|$|The Warp 75 is an LED device {{designed}} by NASA, currently {{used to reduce}} the painful side effects resulting from chemotherapy and radiation treatment in bone marrow and stem cell transplant patients. It was initially used to grow plants in extraterrestrial environments. Glowing red light from <b>High</b> <b>Emissivity</b> Aluminiferous Luminescent Substrate, or HEALS technology has been proven {{to aid in the}} healing of human wounds, burns, diabetic skin ulcers and oral mucositis.|$|E
50|$|A perfect SRI is {{approximately}} 122, the value {{for a perfect}} mirror, which absorbs no sunlight and has very low emissivity. The only practical material which approaches this level is stainless steel with an SRI of 112. High-reflectivity, low-emissivity roofs maintain a temperature very close to ambient at all times preventing heat gains in hot climates and minimizing heat loss in cold climates. <b>High</b> <b>emissivity</b> roofs have much higher heat loss in cold climates for the same insulation values.|$|E
50|$|A perfect roof would absorb no heat in {{the summer}} and lose no {{heat in the}} winter. To do this it would need a very high SRI to {{eliminate}} all radiative heat gains in summer and losses in winter. High SRI roofs act as a radiant barrier, providing a thermos-bottle effect. <b>High</b> <b>emissivity</b> cool roofs carry a climate penalty due to winter radiative heat losses, which reflective bare metal roofs, such as stainless steel, do not.|$|E
40|$|The {{systematic}} optimizations to {{the microwave}} wide band blackbody calibration target {{applied for the}} microwave radiometer’s pre-launch calibrations are researched with its electromagnetic and thermal characteristics based on the Kirchhoff’s law, the sub-grid finite difference time domain（FDTD）method and the thermal analysis. Optimization results indict that round wedge {{is better than the}} square one, the best ratio for height to bottom radius is 4 : 1 for the wide band application, and the absorbing material’s gradual thickness coating and multilayer coating are helpful to guarantee the uniform distribution of surface temperature with a <b>higher</b> <b>emissivity.</b> 1...|$|R
50|$|Refractory metals {{can be used}} as {{selective}} emitters for burner TPVs. Tungsten is {{the most}} common choice. It has <b>higher</b> <b>emissivity</b> in the visible and near-IR range of 0.45 to 0.47 and a low emissivity of 0.1 to 0.2 in the IR region. The emitter is usually {{in the shape of a}} cylinder with a sealed bottom, which can be considered a cavity. The emitter is attached to the back of a thermal absorber such as SiC and maintains the same temperature. Emission occurs in the visible and near IR range, which can be readily converted by the PV to electrical energy.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{emissivity}} {{is important in}} understanding the infrared emissions of objects. This is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the ideal of a black body. To further explain, two objects at the same physical temperature will not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity. For example, for any pre-set emissivity value, objects with <b>higher</b> <b>emissivity</b> will appear hotter, and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler. For that reason, incorrect selection of emissivity will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometers.|$|R

50|$|Hafnium-free {{zirconium}} carbide and niobium carbide {{can be used}} as refractory coatings in nuclear reactors. Because of a low neutron absorption cross-section and weak damage sensitivity under irradiation, it finds use as the coating of uranium dioxide and thorium dioxide particles of nuclear fuel. The coating is usually deposited by thermal chemical vapor deposition in a fluidized bed reactor. It also has <b>high</b> <b>emissivity</b> and high current capacity at elevated temperatures rendering it as a promising material for use in thermo-photovoltaic radiators and field emitter tips and arrays.|$|E
5000|$|Fuels {{that have}} been used for primary firing include coal, {{petroleum}} coke, heavy fuel oil, natural gas, landfill off-gas and oil refinery flare gas. [...] High carbon fuels such as coal are preferred for kiln firing, because they yield a luminous flame. The clinker is brought to its peak temperature mainly by radiant heat transfer, and a bright (i.e. <b>high</b> <b>emissivity)</b> and hot flame is essential for this. In favorable circumstances, high-rank bituminous coal can produce a flame at 2050 °C. Natural gas can only produce a flame of, at best 1950 °C, and this is also less luminous, so it tends to result in lower kiln output.|$|E
40|$|Measurements of the {{microwave}} emission from Arctic Sea ice {{were made with}} aircraft at 8 wavelengths ranging from 0. 510 cm to 2. 81 cm. The expected contrast in emissivities between ice and water was observed at all wavelengths. Distributions of sea ice and open water were mapped from altitudes up to 11 km {{in the presence of}} dense cloud cover. Different forms of ice also exhibited strong contrasts in emissivity. Emissivity differences of up to 0. 2 were observed between two types of ice at 0. 811 cm wavelength.

40|$|Snow microstructure, {{measured}} by plane section analysis, and snow wetness, {{measured by}} the dilution method, are used to calculate input parameters for a microwave emission model that uses the radiative transfer method. The scattering and absorbing properties are calculated by Mie theory. The effects of different equivalent sphere conversions, adjustments for near-field interference, and different snow wetness characterizations are compared for various snow conditions. The concentric shell geometry of liquid water in snow yields <b>higher</b> <b>emissivities</b> and better model results than the separate-sphere configuration for liquid water contents greater than 0. 05, while at lower liquid water contents the separate-sphere treatment gives better results...|$|R

ESMR data on rainfall over the east coast of the United States and the Gulf of Mexico, on snowfall over the northeast coast of the United States, on frontal zones in the northwestern Pacific and on the tropical storm Leila in the South Indian Ocean are examined.

50|$|In {{order to}} get a more {{accurate}} temperature measurement, a thermographer may apply a standard material of known, <b>high</b> <b>emissivity</b> {{to the surface of the}} object. The standard material might be as complex as industrial emissivity spray produced specifically for the purpose, or as simple as standard black insulation tape, with an emissivity of about 0.97. The object's known temperature can then be measured using the standard emissivity. If desired, the object's actual emissivity (on a part of the object that is not covered by the standard material) can then be determined by adjusting the imager's setting to the known temperature. There are situations, however, when such an emissivity test is not possible due to dangerous or inaccessible conditions. In these situations, the thermographer must rely on tables.|$|E
50|$|When ACSR is new, the {{aluminium}} has a shiny surface {{which has}} a low emissivity for heat radiation and a low absorption of sunlight. As the conductor ages the color becomes dull gray due to the oxidation reaction of the aluminium strands. In high pollution environments, the color may almost turn black {{after many years of}} exposure to the elements and chemicals. For aged conductor, the emissivity for heat radiation and the absorption of sunlight increases. Conductor coatings are available that have a <b>high</b> <b>emissivity</b> for high heat radiation and a low absorption of sunlight. These coatings would be applied to new conductor during manufacture. These types of coatings have the ability to potentially increase the current rating of the ACSR conductor. For the same amount of amperage, the temperature of the same conductor will be lower due to the better heat dissipation of the higher emissivity coating.|$|E
50|$|Lighter {{colors and}} also whites and {{metallic}} substances absorb less illuminating light, and thus heat up less; but otherwise color makes small difference as regards heat transfer between an object at everyday temperatures and its surroundings, since the dominant emitted wavelengths are {{nowhere near the}} visible spectrum, but rather in the far infrared. Emissivities at those wavelengths {{have little to do}} with visual emissivities (visible colors); in the far infra-red, most objects have <b>high</b> <b>emissivities.</b> Thus, except in sunlight, the color of clothing makes little difference as regards warmth; likewise, paint color of houses makes little difference to warmth except when the painted part is sunlit.|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} modes of heat transfer. In this study, a simplifying approach for calculating the radiant energy is achieved using the concept of net radiation heat transfer and provides an easy way for solving a variety of situations. This method has been applied to calculate the net radiation heat transfer between two concentric hemispheres. Then this method used to calculate reduction heat transfer when radiation shields with temperature-dependent emissivity applied between these objects. Moreover, using this method the percentage reduction in heat transfer between two surfaces was calculated. The findings reveal that, one radiation shield with lower emissivity can reduce the net heat transfer even better than two radiation shields with <b>higher</b> <b>emissivity...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} of solar cells considerably increases under light-concentrating operations, and the conversion efficiency of solar cells decreases with increasing temperature. It {{is very important}} to reduce the cell temperature in concentrator photovoltaic modules. The thermal radiation layers with <b>high</b> thermal <b>emissivity</b> and thermal conductivity was coated on the aluminum samples which is used for the chassis of concentrator photovoltaic and the effect was evaluated under the conditions with wind.

5000|$|In {{contemporary}} terms, the [...] "emissivities" [...] {{of shiny}} metals are low. Isinglass is an organic glue, {{and has a}} much larger emissivity than the metals. Leslie's cube is still in use to demonstrate and measure the variations in emissivities for different materials. In the figure, the false color images ("thermographs") of a cube at about 55 °C were taken with an infrared camera; {{the black and white}} photographs are taken with an ordinary camera. The black face of the cube is highly emissive, as indicated by the reddish color of the thermograph. The mirror-like, polished face of the aluminum cube emits thermal radiation weakly, as indicated by the blue color. The reflection of the experimenter's hand is green, which corresponds to a <b>high</b> <b>emissivity</b> surface near body temperature (37 °C). The photographs also show that the white painted surface is nearly as emissive as a black surface.|$|E
5000|$|The mantle is {{a roughly}} pear-shaped fabric bag, made from silk, ramie-based {{artificial}} silk, or rayon. The fibers are impregnated with rare-earth metallic salts; when the mantle is heated in a flame, the fibers burn {{away and the}} metallic salts convert to solid oxides, forming a brittle ceramic shell {{in the shape of}} the original fabric. A mantle will glow brightly in the visible spectrum while emitting little infrared radiation. The rare earth oxides (cerium) and actinide (thorium) in the mantle have a low emissivity in the infrared (in comparison with an ideal black body) but have <b>high</b> <b>emissivity</b> in the visible spectrum. There is also some evidence that the emission is enhanced by candoluminescence, the emission of light from the combustion products before they reach thermal equilibrium. [...] The combination of these properties yields a mantle that, when heated by a kerosene or liquified petroleum gas flame, emits intense radiation that is mostly visible light, with relatively little energy in the unwanted infrared, increasing the luminous efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|The western {{portion of}} Lada Terra {{contains}} a large dome-shaped structure about 2000 km across termed, [...] "the Lada Rise," [...] {{which is the}} main highland of the region. It reaches an elevation of about 3 km and is dominated {{by one of the}} most massive corona in the solar system, the Quetzalpetlatl Corona, as well as two massive rift zones surround and partially intersect the rise. [...] The high rises of Venus generally fall into the corona-dominated or rift-dominated categories, but the Lada Rise is unique in that it contains both of these features in relatively equal amounts. [...] In 2007, data retrieved from the Venus Express mission using the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer revealed <b>high</b> <b>emissivity</b> anomalies which is interpreted by many scientists to be a hotspot analogous to the Hawaii hot spot on Earth. This, along with the positive gravity anomaly observed, implies a recently active region. Further evidence is observed in the Boala Corona (which lies inside, and postdates the Quetzalpetlatl Corona), where the grabens formed in the depression of the Corona are interpreted to be surface manifestations of terrestrial dikes. The mantle upwelling associated with hot spot tectonism appears to be the dominant process which formed and evolved the Lada Rise.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a set of {{numerical}} simulations aimed at studying reionization at galactic scale. We use a high resolution simulation of the formation of the Milky Way-M 31 system to simulate the reionization of the local group. The reionization calculation was performed with the post-processing radiative transfer code ATON and the underlying cosmological simulation was performed as part of the CLUES project. We vary the source models to bracket the range of source properties used in the literature. We investigate the structure and propagation of the galatic ionization fronts by a visual examination of our reionization maps. Within the progenitors we find that reionization is patchy, and proceeds locally inside out. The process becomes patchier with decreasing source photon output. It is generally dominated by one major HII region and 1 - 4 additional isolated smaller bubbles, which eventually overlap. <b>Higher</b> <b>emissivity</b> results in faster and earlier local reionization. In all models, the reionization of the Milky Way and M 31 are similar in duration, i. e. between 203 Myr and 22 Myr depending on the source model, placing their zreion between 8. 4 and 13. 7. In all models except the most extreme, the MW and M 31 progenitors reionize internally, ignoring each other, despite being relatively close to each other even during the epoch of reionization. Only in the case of strong supernova feedback suppressing star formation in haloes less massive than 10 ^ 9 M_sun, and using our <b>highest</b> <b>emissivity,</b> we find that the MW is reionized by M 31.
