5|$|Duncan's reign was not {{successful}} {{and he was}} killed by Macbeth on 15 August 1040. Although Shakespeare's Macbeth presents Malcolm as a <b>grown</b> <b>man</b> and his father as an old one, it appears that Duncan was still young in 1040, and Malcolm and his brother Donalbane were children. Malcolm's family did attempt to overthrow Macbeth in 1045, but Malcolm's grandfather Crínán of Dunkeld was killed in the attempt.|$|E
5|$|Henry was Catherine's {{favourite}} son. Unlike his brothers, {{he came to}} {{the throne}} as a <b>grown</b> <b>man.</b> He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as pilgrimages and flagellation.|$|E

25|$|Puzur-Ashur II (c. 1822 BC – c. 1814 BC), son and {{successor}} of Sargon I, {{was king}} of the Old Assyrian Empire for eight years. Due to his father's long reign {{he came to the}} throne at a late age since one of his sons, named Ili-bani, was a witness in a contract (and so already a <b>grown</b> <b>man)</b> eleven years before Puzur-Ashur II became ruler.|$|E
25|$|Port {{was born}} in Southend-on-Sea. When he was a year old, he moved to Dagenham, {{where he grew up}} and his parents still live. He was {{described}} as being a 'loner' at school. His neighbour, Ryan, described him as having a peculiar, childlike personality, exhibiting odd behaviour as a <b>grown</b> <b>man,</b> such as playing with children's toys. He came out as gay in the mid-2000s. He lived alone in a flat in Barking, London, and worked as a chef at a Stagecoach bus depot in West Ham.|$|E
25|$|Frederick {{arrived in}} England in 1728 as a <b>grown</b> <b>man,</b> {{the year after}} his father had become King George II. By then, George and Caroline had had several younger children, and Frederick, himself now Prince of Wales, was a high-spirited youth fond of drinking, {{gambling}} and women. The long separation damaged their relationship, and they would never be close. 1728 also saw the foundation of Fredericksburg, Virginia, which was named after him — his other namesakes are Prince Frederick, Maryland (1722), Fort Frederick, Maine (1729–30), Fort Frederick, South Carolina (1730–34), Fort Frederick, New York (completed 1735) and Fort Frederica, Georgia (founded 1736), while Fort Frederick, Maryland, Point Frederick, Ontario, Fort Frederick, Ontario and Fort Frederick, New Brunswick were also named after him posthumously.|$|E

25|$|Born in Regueiro, Ourense province, on 18 November 1809, Manuel Blanco Romasanta was {{originally}} named Manuela {{as it was}} initially {{thought that he was}} female. He was raised as a girl until the age of six when a doctor discovered his true sex. Because he could read and write, very rare for the time, it is believed his family was relatively wealthy. As a <b>grown</b> <b>man</b> he worked as a tailor and, according to various accounts, was of small stature, being between 1.37m (4'6") and 1.49m (4'11") in height. Following the death of his wife in 1833, Romasanta became a travelling salesman, initially in Esgos, then eventually throughout Galicia and Portugal. Romasanta was also known to act as a guide for travellers crossing the mountains to Castile, Asturias and Cantabria which gave him further opportunities for trade.|$|E

As an only child though, he spent much time alone.|$|E

As a <b>grown</b> <b>man,</b> he was considered very handsome, and usually dressed fashionably. Some accounts give him the title [...] "Colonel".|$|E

Laozi {{was said to have}} emerged as a <b>grown</b> <b>man</b> with a full grey beard and long earlobes, both symbols of wisdom and long life. Other myths state that he was reborn 13 times after his first life during the days of Fuxi. In his last incarnation as Laozi, he lived nine hundred and ninety years and spent his life traveling to reveal the Tao.|$|E
500|$|Author Mark Hertsgaard has {{commented that}} [...] "many of the song's lyrics do seem {{directed}} more at a <b>grown</b> <b>man</b> {{on the verge}} of a powerful new love, especially the lines 'you have found her now go and get her' and 'you're waiting for someone to perform with.'" [...] Music critic and author Tim Riley writes: [...] "If the song is about self-worth and self-consolation in the face of hardship, the vocal performance itself conveys much of the journey. He begins by singing to comfort someone else, finds himself weighing his own feelings in the process, and finally, in the repeated refrains that nurture his own approbation, he comes to believe in himself." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{winners of}} the prize have won other notable awards such as the Venice Biennale, and {{continue}} to present their works at various international exhibitions. [...] Winners' reactions to the award range from Damien Hirst's [...] "A media circus {{to raise money for}} the Tate and Channel 4" [...] to Jeremy Deller's [...] "It blew me away, people's hunger to see what I'd done". Auction prices for works by previous winners have generally increased. [...] The award has also seen some unexpected results: [...] Tracey Emin's My Bed, was overlooked in 1999 despite drawing large crowds to the Tate. [...] The Chapman brothers and Willie Doherty lost out to Grayson Perry in 2003– Perry accepted the award dressed as a girl while Jake Chapman described [...] "losing the Turner prize to a <b>grown</b> <b>man</b> dressed as a small girl" [...] as his [...] "most embarrassing moment".|$|E
500|$|Following the show's {{cancellation}} in 2002, Rogen did not {{get many}} auditions, which was not upsetting {{to him as he}} always thought he would achieve better success as a writer. He would soon be a part of Apatow's [...] "frat pack", a close-knit group that includes Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. Of the awkwardness of a <b>grown</b> <b>man</b> spending so much time with a teenaged Rogen, Apatow said: [...] "I'm such a comedy fan that, even though he's16, I know I'm hanging out with one of the guys who's {{going to be one of}} the great comics." [...] Around this time, Apatow would come up with odd requests for Rogen and Goldberg, such as turn an idea of his into a movie in 10 days and come up with 100 one-page ideas for films. Regarding Apatow's professional effect on Rogen, the actor said in 2009, [...] "Obviously, I can't stress how important Judd's been to my career".|$|E
500|$|Yeats had {{a life-long}} {{interest}} in mysticism, spiritualism, occultism and astrology. He read {{extensively on the}} subjects throughout his life, {{became a member of}} the paranormal research organisation [...] "The Ghost Club" [...] (in 1911) and was especially influenced by the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. As early as 1892, he wrote: [...] "If I had not made magic my constant study I could not have written a single word of my Blake book, nor would The Countess Kathleen ever have come to exist. The mystical life is the centre of all that I do and all that I think and all that I write." [...] His mystical interests—also inspired by a study of Hinduism, under the Theosophist Mohini Chatterjee, and the occult—formed much of the basis of his late poetry. Some critics disparaged this aspect of Yeats's work; W. H. Auden called it the [...] "deplorable spectacle of a <b>grown</b> <b>man</b> occupied with the mumbo-jumbo of magic and the nonsense of India." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Hans Bielenstein, the {{physical}} requirements of subsistence in grain {{can also be}} calculated from the Hanshu: [...] "a family consisting of an old woman, a <b>grown</b> <b>man,</b> a grown woman, an older child, and a younger child, annually consumed 127 hu of unhusked grain. This comes to about 10.5 hu per month." [...] (According to Swann, one hu 斛 equals 0.565 of a US bushel, which is about 5 gallons or 20 liters). Hsu puts the yearly subsistence figure at 140 hu. Bielenstein also examines salary tables given in both the Hanshu and the Houhan shu (Book of the Later Han) that list official salaries half in cash and half in unhusked grain. Based on these tables, he derives a conversion between cash and hu: a [...] "generally accepted average is 70 to 80 cash for Former Han and 100 cash for Later Han." [...] Based on this conversion, the cash value of the grain needed for subsistence was about 8,890 to 14,000 coins per year during the Han dynasty.|$|E

Collins required to get permission to stay outside the village for multiple nights in a row, and the committee stated he violated team discipline rules. On the issue of not being allowed to compete, Collins said [...] "I feel that I should stay in a hotel with my wife, with or without their permission, that’s the honest to God truth whether they like it or not." [...] He planned to never race for the country again, stating, [...] "This is how it ends, it ends on a really sad note. I should have been allowed to run.

[...] West is more desperate, transparent, awkward, vulnerable." [...] Music critic Nathan Rabin states that Jay-Z and West [...] "are a study in contrasts: the businessman and the bohemian, the faithful husband and the drugged-up playboy, the walking press release and the loose cannon. Jay-Z is tidy. Kanye is nothing but rough edges." [...] Jon Caramanica writes similarly, [...] "breaking [...] old barriers is a means to acceptance and stability" [...] for Jay-Z, while [...] "West sounds lonely" [...] with his fame, adding that [...] "For Mr. West every flash of Dionysian extreme is tempered by the realization of its hollowness."
