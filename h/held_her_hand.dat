500|$|There {{was this}} one time where I {{had to take a}} blind lady across the street and I’d never done that before. I took her hand which is so {{obviously}} wrong! You don’t take a stranger’s hand! Like a 45-year-old woman! But once you take someone’s hand you can’t just let go because then you’re admitting your own awkwardness. I just <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{and in the middle of}} the street she turns around and is like, ‘Do you mind if we don’t hold hands.’ ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1947 Ted Kavanagh, the {{scriptwriter}} of the BBC Home Service show It's That Man Again (ITMA), {{visited the}} Players' and invited Jacques {{to audition for}} the series, which she did on 18 September, for a fee of five guineas. She became so nervous during the audition that Tommy Handley, the show's star, <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> which she found made her more nervous. Jacques joined the cast of ITMA as the greedy schoolgirl Sophie Tuckshop, where she [...] "would regale listeners with terrifying accounts of epic binges", before finishing her stories with the catchphrase [...] "But I'm all right now". Jacques started her run in ITMA in September 1947, {{at the beginning of}} series eleven, which ran for 38 episodes, and was paid ten guineas per episode.|$|E
60|$|He seemed again {{unaware of}} her, though he <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> close.|$|E
60|$|She {{laughed and}} shook <b>her</b> head, and <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> up for inspection.|$|R
60|$|Virginia gave {{a little}} cry and started forward. But he <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R
60|$|He <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> tightly. A great {{pity for}} her filled his heart--pity for her, and for himself.|$|R
60|$|The {{last words}} were {{said in an}} undertone, as he <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|She seemed shy, at once {{very near}} and very remote. I <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> awkwardly until the {{carriage}} stopped.|$|E
60|$|He <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> for a moment. The fingers {{seemed to}} respond to his touch with a little thrill.|$|E
60|$|He still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> {{standing}} {{close to}} her, {{as though he}} had some special right to comfort her.|$|R
60|$|Betty bathed {{and cooled}} his heated brow. He caught and <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> looking wonderingly at her the while.|$|R
60|$|He stooped {{down and}} kissed the pale, {{trembling}} lips, and <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> tightly. <b>Her</b> breath was coming fast, and she spoke with difficulty.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{laid her}} head down again on the pillow and, {{kneeling}} beside her, <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in his.|$|E
60|$|She {{tried to}} leave him, and ring the bell. He <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> firmly, and drew her closer to him.|$|E
60|$|Venetia {{had drawn}} her chair {{close to that}} of her mother; she sat by her side and <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if it be a trouble, M. Adolphe;" [...] and {{the proud}} girl still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> upon <b>her</b> bosom, and still looked towards the mountain.|$|R
60|$|UNEASY and startled, Gale listened and, hearing nothing, {{wondered}} if Mercedes's fears had not worked upon her imagination. He felt a trembling seize <b>her,</b> and he <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> tightly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll try it!" [...] {{cried the}} boy, jumping up. [...] "But I wonder if I can {{remember}} the words old Mombi said, {{and the way she}} <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> up." ...|$|R
60|$|When she had kissed him, {{and he had}} <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> a minute, his {{thoughts}} {{went back to the}} money.|$|E
60|$|Carrie <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> to {{her face}} a moment, as if the fire were hot, and then smiled as she looked up.|$|E
60|$|He <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> for {{a moment}} and then turned away, and a few minutes later he and Carroll left the Dene.|$|E
60|$|They sank on the {{benching}} {{that ran}} round the wall; he <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> fast {{in one of}} his, and kept his other arm about her as they sat side by side.|$|R
6000|$|... “God sent me too, I think. I was ill when I came, but {{the sight}} of you does wonders.” He <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> which steadied and quickened him. “I’ve {{something}} to tell you.” ...|$|R
60|$|I obeyed, and {{bending down}} she <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> over {{me as though}} in blessing, then pointed towards the {{curtains}} which at this moment were drawn asunder, by whom I do not know.|$|R
6000|$|If he <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> another moment, she trembled, she'd {{be on his}} lap, in his arms--lost. And he {{was holding}} it. He was---- ...|$|E
60|$|He {{seemed a}} little dazed, even after he had saluted mechanically, <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{for a moment and}} sank into the place by her side.|$|E
60|$|Shirley, solicitous to soothe, <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> over Mr. Moore's as it {{lay on the}} arm of the chair. She just {{touched it}} lightly, scarce palpably.|$|E
60|$|She {{sank into}} a chair, as if utterly weary and exhausted, and he, forgetting his danger, forgetting {{the world and}} all else besides, knelt at <b>her</b> feet, and <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> in his.|$|R
60|$|Betty trembled. Something in his voice, a tone she {{had never}} heard before startled her. She looked up at him half {{unconscious}} that he still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> in his. Never had she appeared so lovely.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> [...] "It is Father Adrian who {{is sending}} you away," [...] I cried passionately. [...] "He is my enemy. I hate him! Why should you obey him? Stay with me! Do, do stay!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good night!' {{repeated}} Guy, as he <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> 'It is so {{long since}} I have had any one to wish me good night! Good night, mamma!' ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> She {{placed it}} in his unresistingly. All the lines in his face seemed {{smoothed}} out. The fire of youth was in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{crossed the}} log without a tremor and running to where Lawrence sat {{put her arm}} round him. Lawrence said nothing, but took and <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|Arnold <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> steadfastly {{and looked}} into her eyes. They were more {{beautiful}} than ever now with their mist of risen tears. But {{there were other things}} in her face, things less easy to understand. He turned away regretfully.|$|R
6000|$|Very {{slowly the}} sobbing died away, till {{it was just}} a long shivering, but still the girl <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> over <b>her</b> face and her face down. Gyp felt paralyzed. The unhappy girl, the red and green room, the smell of mutton--creeping! ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>held</b> out <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> which Featherstone kissed on his knee.|$|R
