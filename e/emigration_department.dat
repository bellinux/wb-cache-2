60|$|Colonel Lamb, {{the head}} of the Salvation Army <b>Emigration</b> <b>Department,</b> {{informed}} me that during the past seven years the Army has emigrated about 50,000 souls, of whom 10,000 were assisted out of its funds, the rest paying their own way or being paid for from one source or another. From 8,000 to 10,000 people have been sent during the present year, 1910, most of them to Canada, which is the Mecca of the Salvation Army Emigration policy. So carefully have all these people been selected, that not 1 per cent have ever been returned to this country by the Canadian Authorities as undesirable. The truth is that those Authorities have the greatest confidence in the discretion of the Army, and in its ability to handle this matter to the advantage of all concerned.|$|E

50|$|After World War Two, Malta's <b>Emigration</b> <b>Department</b> {{would assist}} emigrants {{with the cost}} of their travel. Between 1948 and 1967, 30 per cent of the {{population}} emigrated. After 1962, Maltese people required vouchers to migrate to the UK, but these were relatively easy to obtain from the <b>Emigration</b> <b>Department</b> until 1971. The <b>Emigration</b> <b>Department</b> would arrange for prospective migrants to be interviewed by British firms in order to allow their passage to the UK to fill labour shortages. At this time, it was also common for Maltese women to marry British military servicemen, and for Maltese to join British merchant ships. Migration statistics recorded in Malta and the UK differ {{in terms of the number}} of Maltese migrants recorded. Maltese statistics suggest that 8,282 people left Malta for the UK between 1963 and 1970 (inclusive), with 949 recorded as returning. British statistics, meanwhile, suggest that 8,110 Maltese migrants arrived in the same period, excluding students, diplomats, seamen, visitors and their families. Between 1946 and the late 1970s, over 140,000 people left Malta on the assisted passage scheme, with 57.6 per cent migrating to Australia, 22 per cent to the UK, 13 per cent to Canada and 7 per cent to the United States.|$|E

About 3,000 Roma live in Lithuania, mostly in Vilnius, Kaunas and Panevėžys; their organizations are supported by the National Minority and <b>Emigration</b> <b>Department.</b> For centuries a small Tatar community has flourished in Lithuania.|$|E
50|$|The Committee {{brokered}} {{with the}} Vreemdelingenpolitie (lit. Aliens Police) for entry visas for refugees. The Dutch government policy {{was aimed at}} minimizing the numbers of entry visas that were granted to refugees, with priority to those refugees whose further emigration looked likely. The promotion of emigration was therefore {{one of the main}} tasks of the Committee. Over the years, the <b>Emigration</b> <b>Department</b> helped more than 18,000 refugees emigrate from the Netherlands, as well as assisting the direct emigration of more than 3,000 people in other countries.|$|E

The Stolypin agrarian reforms included resettlement benefits for peasants who moved to Siberia. An <b>emigration</b> <b>department</b> was created in 1906 at the ministry of agriculture. It organized resettlement and assisted the settlers during their first years in the new settlements. The settlers received on average 16.5 hectares of land per man. The total area allocated was 21 million hectares. Migrants received a small state subsidy, exemption from some taxes, and advice from state agencies specifically developed to help with peasant resettlement.|$|E

Livingstone led the department for the British Commonwealth, Werner Hirschwald the Latin American section and Sylvia Wolff the Scandinavian. By October 1939 all offices of Grüber's Bureau moved to An der Stechbahn. A welfare department under Richard Kobrak supported the often impoverished victims of persecution and Margarete Draeger organised the Kindertransporte. Erwin Reisner served the victims as chaplain.

40|$|This {{collection}} primarily {{documents the}} professional {{life of the}} social worker Gertrude van Tijn, who worked with Jewish refugees in Amsterdam during the 1930 s- 1940 s. Much of the material focuses on the experiences of Dutch Jewry along with the German-Jewish refugees who had fled to Holland. About half the collection relates to the manual training farm Werkdorp Nieuwesluis. Some reports on the postwar refugee situation in Shanghai and Australia and biographical material are also present. The collection includes reports, correspondence, official documents, newspaper clippings and articles and a few photographs. digitizedOn July 4, 1891 Gertrude Francisca Cohn was born in Braunschweig, Germany. She studied social work under Alice Salomon at the Lotte-Verein in Berlin. In 1910 she went to England, where she had relatives. Made to leave due to her nationality, in 1915 {{she went to the}} neutral country of Holland, where she worked for a time for the banker C. E. ter Meulen. and became involved in the Zionist movement, attending meetings with Chaim Weizmann, Norman Bentwich and others. In 1919 Gertrude Cohn married the engineer and geologist Jan van Tijn. They lived a year in Switzerland, and in 1921 had a daughter. The family lived in South Africa, Holland, and Mexico, where their son was born. From 1925 until 1932 they lived in South Africa with explorations to various countries nearby. On their return to Holland in late 1932, where her husband had accepted a position as engineer, Gertrude van Tijn visited Palestine for the first time. In April 1933 she began to assist with the growing number of Jewish refugees from Germany. This assistance led to Gertrude van Tijn becoming the representative of the Joint Distribution Committee in Holland and a member of an advisory committee of the League of Nations' Commission for Refugees. She became head of the <b>Emigration</b> <b>Department</b> of the Dutch Refugee Committee and also the secretary of the Werkdorp Nieuwesluis, a farm founded in 1934 in the Wieringermeer polder in North Holland that trained refugees of varying ages and vocations in agricultural work as well as construction, the raising of cattle and poultry, domestic work, gardening, cabinetry, locksmithing, and other practical work. She also aided in organizing the trip of the Dora, a ship which in 1939 brought a number of refugees from Amsterdam to Palestine. Although she sent her children abroad, Gertrude van Tijn remained in Holland and chose not to go into hiding because of her work assisting refugees. In September 1943 she was sent to the concentration camp Westerbork and then to Bergen-Belsen. In July 1944 she was among those Jews in Bergen-Belsen, who were exchanged for Germans in Palestine, and the Dutch government in exile offered her a position in London to work with displaced Jews. In this capacity she traveled through liberated Europe and Switzerland {{until the end of the}} war. After reuniting with her children in New York the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration offered her a position working with refugees in China. She stayed in this role for a year then spent three months working with the Joint Distribution Committee in Australia before going to the United States, eventually settling in 1958 in Portland, Oregon. Gertrude van Tijn died in Portland in 1974. 16 catalogue cards. Photographs removed to Photograph CollectionProcesse...|$|E
