25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
500|$|Lennertz {{recorded}} the soundtrack at The Village recording studio in West Los Angeles and Capitol Records. Lennertz attempted to remain [...] "authentic" [...] to the characters' progression from average worker to calculated killer. To achieve this aim, he decided against recording digitally, instead recording the tracks on two-inch analog tape, intending each musical cue to {{sound as if}} it was emanating from a vinyl record. He explained, [...] "The idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album. It isn't over-produced or shiny and digital in any way. It's brash, noisy, and full of bravado and swagger. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we could harness some of this sonic magic in the score, then the toughness and confidence of the music would play against Bateman, Sudeikis, and Charlie Day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that transpire." [...] Lennertz continued, [...] "We tracked through tape before Pro Tools to get that fat sound, and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection. We even used the same Wurlitzer that Money Mark played on Beck's classic ‘Where It's At’. At the end of the day, Seth [...] and I wanted to produce a score that is as irreverent and full of attitude as the movie itself. I think we did it...and most of all, everyone had a blast in the process." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gilmour {{signed to}} play World Series Cricket. [...] "I {{had been in}} arid {{out of the side}} {{for a couple of years}} and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I signed for World Series Cricket I was going to get some {{monetary}} reward for all the hours I'd spent in the past six or seven years. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I kept playing for the board I wasn't guaranteed any financial reward at all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ellison recalls [...] "I {{had played}} in the winning tour to India of 1984–85 and bowled well, or so I thought. But I was injured for {{the early part of}} the 1985 season, which was {{incredibly}} frustrating. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> fit, I could make a compelling case for my inclusion in the Ashes team." [...] His determination to get back into the Test squad was not deterred by not being selected for the first three Tests, but he then had an opportunity to impress the then England captain, David Gower. Ellison's recollection is that [...] "Kent, my county, were playing a game against Leicestershire in July and I approached [...] David Gower and said: 'I'm going to make you pick [...] me.' I soon started to take wickets and was called into the squad for the fourth Test in Manchester." [...] Ellison took 3–58 in the first-class match, including Gower's wicket in the only innings in which he bowled.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchcock {{returned}} to the UK for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944. While there he made two short films in French for the British Ministry of Information: Bon Voyage and Aventure Malgache. The two British propaganda films made for the Free French were the only films that Hitchcock made in the French language, and they [...] "feature typical Hitchcockian touches". On his motivation for making the films, Hitchcock stated: [...] "I {{felt the need to}} make a little contribution to the war effort, and I was both overweight and over-age for military service. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I did nothing, I'd regret {{it for the rest of}} my life." [...] From late June to late July 1945, Hitchcock served as [...] "treatment advisor" [...] on a Holocaust documentary which used footage provided by the Allied Forces. It was produced by Sidney Bernstein of the British Ministry of Information, and was assembled in London. Bernstein brought his future 1948–49 production partner Hitchcock on board as a consultant for the film editing process for the British Ministry of Information and the American Office of War Information.|$|E
6000|$|It's {{all very}} fine to talk,' said Mrs Quilp with much simplicity, 'but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was to die to-morrow, Quilp could marry anybody he pleased--now that he could, I know!' ...|$|R

2500|$|Abe {{was arrested}} and interrogated over eight sessions. When asked why she had severed Ishida's genitalia, Abe replied, [...] "Because I couldn't take his head or body with me. I {{wanted to take the}} part of him that brought back to me the most vivid memories." [...] The {{interrogating}} officer was struck by Abe's demeanor when asked why she had killed Ishida. [...] "Immediately she became excited and her eyes sparkled in a strange way." [...] Her answer was: [...] "I loved him so much, I wanted him all to myself. But since we were not husband and wife, as long as he lived he could be embraced by other women. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I killed him no other woman could ever touch him again, so I killed him....." [...] In attempting to explain what distinguished Abe's case from over a dozen other similar cases in Japan, William Johnston suggests that it is this answer which captured the imagination of the nation. [...] "She had killed not out of jealousy but out of love." [...] Mark Schreiber notes that the Sada Abe incident occurred {{at a time when the}} Japanese media were preoccupied with extreme political and military troubles, including the Ni Ni Roku incident and a looming full-scale war in China. He suggests that a sensationalistic sex scandal such as this served as a welcome national release from the disturbing events of the time. The incident also struck a chord with the ero-guro-nansensu ("erotic-grotesque-nonsense") style popular at the time, and the Sada Abe Incident came to represent that genre for years to come.|$|E

6000|$|I was staggered, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{he wished}} to delay {{he had a good}} reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could, [...] "Don't wait more than need be. You know, I am sure, what torture I am in." ...|$|E
