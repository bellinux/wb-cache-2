25|$|Tobacco use leads most {{commonly}} to diseases affecting the heart, liver and lungs. Smoking {{is a major}} risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer). It also causes peripheral vascular disease and hypertension. The effects depend on the number of years that a person smokes and on how much the person smokes. Starting smoking earlier in life and smoking cigarettes higher in tar increases the risk of these diseases. Also, <b>environmental</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke,</b> or secondhand smoke, has been shown to cause adverse health effects in people of all ages. Tobacco use is a significant factor in miscarriages among pregnant smokers, and it contributes to a number of other health problems of the fetus such as premature birth, low birth weight, and increases by 1.4 to 3 times the chance of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Incidence of erectile dysfunction is approximately 85 percent higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers.|$|E

40|$|Current {{understanding}} of the pathogenesis of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), a source of substantial morbidity and mortality in the United States, suggests that chronic inflammation leads to the airways obstruction and parenchymal destruction that characterize this condition. <b>Environmental</b> factors, especially <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure, are known to accelerate longitudinal decline of lung function, and there is substantial evidence that upregulation of inflammatory pathways plays a vital role in this process.

30|$|Epigenetic {{mechanisms}} may {{be involved}} in the induction of asthma due to <b>environmental</b> <b>tobacco</b> exposure (ETS) or even worse, <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure in utero. ETS {{is the single most important}} environmental factor increasing asthma risk by approximately 20  % [15]. Unfortunately, millions of children are exposed to <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> from very early on and within families, and this pattern of exposure is present over generations. What this can induce was very impressively shown recently in a rat animal model [16], when pregnant mother animals (F 0 generation) were exposed to <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke.</b> Their offspring (F 1 generation) showed massively impaired lung function from early on and until adulthood, even though this F 1 generation was never exposed to <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke.</b> Even more astonishing, the next generation (F 2 generation) showed lung function alterations, although it was only their grandparent generation that was once exposed to <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke.</b> Lung function impairment was accompanied by epigenetic changes (a) in the lung and (b) in the germ line persisting over generations. In the lungs, differences in histone (H 3 and H 4) acetylation were found across generation and methylation signatures were changed in testis and ovaries. In humans, this smoking grandparent effect on asthma development in the offspring was also reported [17] but no epigenetic analyses were available in that study at the time. However, epigenetic effects of tobacco smoking are very well documented [18] and even after in utero tobacco exposure, massive changes in methylation signatures were found in newborns. However, for these children, data on disease development are not (yet) available [19].|$|R

The different extents of helix distortions, as well as differences in the overall binding of XPC/HR 23 B to double-stranded DNA containing either of the three stereoisomeric B[a]P-N 2 -dG lesions, are correlated with dual incisions catalyzed by a reconstituted incision system of six purified NER factors, and by the full NER apparatus in cell-free nuclear extracts...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{were the}} first to {{demonstrate}} that direct application of the <b>environmental</b> pollutant and <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> constituent dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DB[a,l]P) into the oral cavity of mice induced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in oral tissues but not in the tongue; however, the mechanisms that can account for the varied carcinogenicity remain to be determined. Furthermore, we also showed that not only dA adducts, but also dG adducts can account for the mutagenic activity of DB[a,l]P in the oral tissues in vivo. In this study, we initially focused on DB[a,l]P-induced genotoxic effects in both oral and tongue tissues. Therefore, to fully assess the contribution of these DNA adducts in the initiation stage of carcinogenesis induced by DB[a,l]P, an LC-MS/MS method to simultaneously detect and quantify DB[a,l]PDE-dG and-dA adducts was developed.

2500|$|Many {{governments are}} trying to deter people from smoking with anti-smoking campaigns in mass media {{stressing}} the harmful long-term effects of smoking. Passive smoking, or secondhand smoking, which affects people {{in the immediate vicinity}} of smokers, is a major reason for the enforcement of smoking bans. This is a law enforced to stop individuals smoking in indoor public places, such as bars, pubs and restaurants. The idea behind this is to discourage smoking by making it more inconvenient, and to stop harmful smoke being present in enclosed public spaces. A common concern among legislators is to discourage smoking among minors and many states have passed laws against selling tobacco products to underage customers (establishing a smoking age). Many developing countries have not adopted anti-smoking policies, leading some to call for anti-smoking campaigns and further education to explain the negative effects of ETS (<b>Environmental</b> <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Smoke)</b> in developing countries.

There have been few studies conducted on the correlation of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure to IQ. This is the first study of this type in Indonesia. Objectives To assess the correlation between <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure and IQ in preschool children and to assess the correlation between serum cotinine levels and IQ in preschool children exposed to <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke.</b> Methods A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} the Tuminting district, Manado in January - May 2011. Subjects were collected by random sampling of 3 - 5 year-old children. In our study, 35 children were deemed to have been exposed to <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> by serum cotinine ~ 0. 05 ng/ml and 25 children were deemed to not have been exposed to <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> (cotinine < 0. 05 ng/ml). Results were analyzed by t-test and simple correlation analysis using SPSS version 17 software with a significance level of P < 0. 05. Results There was a statistically significant difference in IQ between the two groups, with mean IQ of 106. 54 in the group exposed to <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> and mean IQ of 109. 36 in the group not exposed to <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> (P= 0. 01).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the location of hospitality venues considering; rurality, presence of local ordinances, and socioeconomic status, influenced the quantity of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> pollution in a predominantly rural state. The study built on current scientific literature in four aspects. First, it was the first U. S. statewide study on <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> pollution levels in hospitality venues. Second, it quantified indoor <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> pollution specifically in rural areas. Third, it used random sampling, a method rarely used in studying indoor <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> pollution. Fourth, it analyzed <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure as a function of socioeconomic status. A stratified random sample of 136 restaurant and bars were assessed, using a modification Roswell Cancer Park Institute’s method, for the indoor air quality indicator of particulate matter that was 2. 5 μm aerodynamic diameter or smaller (PM 2. 5). A unique partial mediation model found 69. 1 % of smoke-free policy’s impact on <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> pollution was mediated by observed smoking and 30. 9 % was the direct impact of policy on <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> pollution levels. A significant association (Welch’s F(2, 43. 63) = 9. 55, p <. 001) between rurality and <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> pollution in bars was also observed. A significant association (R 2 = 0. 51, F(3, 131) = 70. 47, p <. 001) between local smoke-free laws and <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> pollution depended upon the venue type. Compliance was significantly lower in venues in communities without local ordinances (Fisher’s Exact Test, p<. 01, 2 -tailed) and in co-located venues (Fisher’s Exact Test, p<. 01, 2 -tailed). 	In conclusion, smoke-free laws had an indirect and direct impact on <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> pollution. As rurality increased <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> pollution in bars significantly increased. The impact of local ordinances on <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> pollution levels depended on the venue type. Compliance with laws increased significantly in communities with a local ordinance and decreased significantly in co-located venues. Continued recognition of the disparities in exposure to <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> pollution in rural areas is needed. Future studies should determine if the mediation model can be replicated. Additional studies of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure and policy impact in rural areas are needed.
