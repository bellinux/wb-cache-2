50|$|Nystatin A1 (or {{referred}} to as nystatin) is biosynthesized by a bacterial strain, Streptomyces noursei. The structure of this active compound is characterized as a polyene macrolide with a <b>deoxysugar</b> D-mycosamine, an aminoglycoside. The genomic sequence of nystatin reveals {{the presence of the}} polyketide loading module (nysA), six polyketide synthases modules (nysB, nysC, nysI, nysJ, and nysK) and two thioesterase modules (nysK and nysE). It is evident that the biosynthesis of the macrolide functionality follows the polyketide synthase I pathway.|$|E
40|$|Doxorubicin, one of {{the most}} widely used anticancer drugs, is {{composed}} of a tetracyclic polyketide aglycone and l-daunosamine as a <b>deoxysugar</b> moiety, which acts as an important determinant of its biological activity. This is exemplified by the fewer side effects of semisynthetic epirubicin (4 ′-epi-doxorubicin). An efficient combinatorial biosynthetic system that can convert the exogenous aglycone ε-rhodomycinone into diverse glycosylated derivatives of doxorubicin or its biosynthetic intermediates, rhodomycin D and daunorubicin, was developed through the use of Streptomyces venezuelae mutants carrying plasmids that direct the biosynthesis of different nucleotide deoxysugars and their transfer onto aglycone, as well as the postglycosylation modifications. This system improved epirubicin production from ε-rhodomycinone by selecting a substrate flexible glycosyltransferase, AknS, which was able to transfer the unnatural sugar donors and a TDP- 4 -ketohexose reductase, AvrE, which efficiently supported the biosynthesis of TDP- 4 -epi-l-daunosamine. Furthermore, a range of doxorubicin analogs containing diverse <b>deoxysugar</b> moieties, seven of which are novel rhodomycin D derivatives, were generated. This provides new insights into the functions of <b>deoxysugar</b> biosynthetic enzymes and demonstrates the potential of the S. venezuelae-based combinatorial biosynthetic system as a simple biological tool for modifying structurally complex sugar moieties attached to anthracyclines as an alternative to chemical syntheses for improving anticancer agents...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA plasmid (pLN 2) was {{generated}} in which genes {{involved in the}} biosynthesis of L-oleandrose in the oleandomycin producer Streptomyces antibioticus ATCC 11891 were cloned. pLN 2 was used to direct the biosynthesis of different <b>deoxysugars</b> by exchanging and/or adding genes from other antibiotic biosynthetic clusters. Transfer of the synthesized <b>deoxysugars</b> to the tetracenomycin C aglycon, 8 -demethyl-tetracenomycin C, {{through the use of}} the “sugar flexible” glycosyltransferase ElmGT, validated the system. Several pLN 2 derivatives were constructed by replacement of the oleU 4 -ketoreductase gene by different 4 -ketoreductase genes. Some of them, such as EryBIV and UrdR, reduced the keto group of the 4 -keto intermediates, generating L-olivosyl and D-olivosyl derivatives, respectively. The system was also used to generate an L-rhamnosyl derivative (through a two-gene deletion) and an L-rhodinosyl derivative (through a combination of a gene replacement and a gene addition) ...|$|R

The analysis was carried out using liquid chromatography coupled with highly selective and sensitive tandem mass spectrometry. Polysaccharides were detected in all sizes ranging from 0. 035 to 10 μm in diameter with distinct features of heteropolysaccharides, enriched in xylose, glucose + mannose {{as well as a}} substantial fraction of <b>deoxysugars.</b> Polysaccharides containing <b>deoxysugars</b> showed a bimodal structure with about 60 % of their mass found in the Aitken mode over the pack ice area. Pentose (xylose) and hexose (glucose + mannose) showed a weaker bimodal character and were largely found in the coarse mode in addition to a minor fraction apportioned in the sub-micrometer size range. The concentration of total hydrolysable neutral sugars (THNS) in the samples collected varied over 3 orders of magnitude (1 to 692 pmol m − 3) in the super-micrometer size fraction {{and to a lesser extent}} in sub-micrometer particles (4 to 88 pmol m − 3). Lowest THNS concentrations were observed in air masses that had spent more than 5 days over the pack ice. Within the pack ice area, about 53 % (by mass) of the total mass of polysaccharides were found in sub-micrometer particles. The relative abundance of sub-micrometer polysaccharides was closely related to the length of time that the air mass spent over pack ice, with highest fraction (> 90 %) observed for > 7 days of advection. The ambient aerosol particles collected onboard ship showed similar monosaccharide composition, compared to particles generated experimentally in situ at the open lead site. This supports the existence of a primary source of particulate polysaccharides from open leads by bubble bursting at the air-sea interface. We speculate that the presence of biogenic polysaccharides, due to their surface active and hygroscopic nature, could play a potential role as cloud condensation nuclei in the pristine high Arctic...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: Streptomyces fradiae is the {{principal}} producer of urdamycin A. The antibiotic consists of a polyketide-derived aglycone, which is glycosylated with four sugar components, 2 × D-olivose (first and last sugar of a C-glycosidically bound trisaccharide chain at the 9 -position), and 2 × L-rhodinose (in {{the middle of the}} trisaccharide chain and at the 12 b-position). Limited information is available about both the biosynthesis of D-olivose and L-rhodinose and the influence of the concentration of both sugars on urdamycin biosynthesis. Results: To further investigate urdamycin biosynthesis, a 5. 4 kb section of the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster was sequenced. Five new open reading frames (ORFs) (urdZ 3, urdQ, urdR, urdS, urdT) could be identified each one showing significant homology to <b>deoxysugar</b> biosynthetic genes. We inactivated four of these newly allocated ORFs (urdZ 3, urdQ, urdR, urdS) as well as urdZ 1, a previously found putative <b>deoxysugar</b> biosynthetic gene. Inactivation of urdZ 3, urdQ and urdZ 1 prevented the mutant strains from producing L-rhodinose resulting in the accumulation of mainly urdamycinone B. Inactivation of urdR {{led to the formation of}} the novel urdamycin M, which carries a C-glycosidically attached D-rhodinose at the 9 -position. The novel urdamycins N and O were detected after overexpression of urdGT 1 c in two different chromosomal urdGT 1 c deletion mutants. The mutants lacking urdS and urdQ accumulated various known diketopiperazines. Conclusions: Analysis of <b>deoxysugar</b> biosynthetic genes of the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster revealed a widely common biosynthetic pathway leading to D-olivose and L-rhodinose. Several enzymes responsible for specific steps of this pathway could be assigned. The pathway had to be modified compared to earlier suggestions. Two glycosyltransferases normally involved in the C-glycosyltransfer of D-olivose at the 9 -position (UrdGT 2) and in conversion of 100 - 2 to urdamycin G (UrdGT 1 c) show relaxed substrate specificity for their activated <b>deoxysugar</b> co-substrate and their alcohol substrate, respectively. They can transfer activated D-rhodinose (instead of D-olivose) to the 9 -position, and attach L-rhodinose to the 4 A-position normally occupied by a D-olivose unit, respectively...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Combinatorial {{biosynthesis}} techniques using polyketide synthases (PKSs) in {{heterologous host}} organisms have enabled {{the production of}} macrolide aglycone libraries in which many positions of the macrolactone ring have been manipulated. However, the <b>deoxysugar</b> moieties of macrolides, absent in previous libraries, {{play a critical role}} in contributing to the antimicrobial properties exhibited by compounds such as erythromycin. Since the glycosidic components of polyketides dramatically alter their molecular binding properties, it would be useful to develop general expression hosts and vectors for synthesis and attachment of deoxysugars to expand the nature and size of such polyketide libraries. Results: A set of nine <b>deoxysugar</b> biosynthetic and auxiliary genes from the picromycin/methymycin (pik) cluster was integrated in the chromosome of Streptomyces lividans to create a host which synthesizes TDP-D-desosamine. The pik desosaminyl transferase was also included so that when the strain was transformed with a previously constructed library of expression plasmids encoding genetically modified PKSs that produce different macrolactones, the resulting strains produced desosaminylated derivatives. Although conversion of the macrolactones was generally low, bioassays revealed that, unlike their aglycone precursors, these novel macrolides possessed antibiotic activity. Conclusions: Based on the structural differences among the compounds that were glycosylated it appears that the desosaminyl transferase from the pik gene cluster is quite tolerant of changes in the macrolactone substrate. Since others have demonstrated tolerance towards modifications in the sugar substituent, one can imagine employing this approach to alter both polyketide and <b>deoxysugar</b> pathways to produce ‘unnatural’ natural product libraries...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{biological}} activity of many microbial products requires {{the presence of}} one or more <b>deoxysugar</b> molecules attached to agylcone. This is especially prevalent among polyketides and is an important reason that the antitumor anthracycline antibiotics are avid DNA-binding drugs. The ability to make different deoxyaminosugars and attach them to the same or different aglycones in vivo would facilitate the synthesis of new anthracyclines and the quest for antitumor drugs. This is feasible using the numerous bacterial genes for <b>deoxysugar</b> biosynthesis that are now available. Results: Production of thymidine diphospho (TDP) -l-daunosamine (dnm), the aminodeoxysugar present in the anthracycline antitumor drugs daunorubicin (DNR) and doxorubicin (DXR), and its attachment to ε-rhodomycinone to generate rhodomycin D has been achieved by bioconversion with a strain of Streptomyces lividans that bears two plasmids. One contained the Streptomyces peucetius dnmJVUZTQS genes plus dnmW (previously named dpsH and considered to be a polyketide cyclase gene), dnrH, which is not required for the formation of rhodomycin D, and dnrl, a regulatory gene required for expression of the dnm and drr genes. The other plasmid had genes encoding glucose- 1 -phosphate thymidylyltransferase and TDP-glucose- 4, 6 -dehydratase (dnmL and dnmM, respectively, or mtmDE, their homologs from Streptomyces agrillaceus) plus the drrAB DNR/DXR resistance genes. Conclusions: The high-yielding glycosylation of the aromatic polyketide ε-rhodomycinone using plasmid-borne <b>deoxysugar</b> biosynthesis genes proves that the minimal information for l-daunosamine biosynthesis and attachment in the heterologous host is encoded by the dnmLMJVUTS genes. This is a general approach to making both known and new glycosides of anthracyclines, several of which have medically important antitumor activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{unicellular}} acidophilic red alga Galdieria sulphuraria is a facultative heterotroph with {{a complex}} uptake system for sugars and polyols, consisting {{of at least}} 14 transporters. Upon transfer to heterotrophic conditions, these transporters were induced simultaneously. Once induced, transporters for common hexoses and pentoses are apparently not down-regulated under heterotrophic conditions. Uptake of <b>deoxysugars</b> (FUC/Rha), however, was repressed by substrates metabolized via gluco-, galacto-, glycero-, or hexokinase, whereas substrates phosphorylated by xylulokinase had no effect. This indicates that several sugar kinases {{play a key role}} in sugar sensing. In contrast, polyol transporters were repressed only by glucose or its analogs but not by other sugars. This repression does not involve the activity of kinases. Most likely this type of glucose sensing is independent of metabolism and takes place prior to or during uptake. In its natural environment, these two different sensing mechanisms would enable the alga to utilize a mixture of different substrates in a most economic way by repressing dispensible transporters...|$|R
40|$|The acidophilic and {{thermophilic}} red alga Galdieria sulphuraria {{is able to}} grow heterotrophically on {{at least}} six different pentoses. These pentoses are reduced in the cell to pentiols by an NADP-dependent aldose reductase.

The aldose reductase was purified 130 -fold to apparent homogeneity by column chromatography. The enzyme is a homodimer of about 80 kD, as estimated by size-exclusion chromatography and from the sedimentation behavior. The Michaelis constant values for D-xylose (27 mM), D-ribose (29 mM), D-lyxose (30 mM), and D-arabinose (38 mM) were about {{three to five times}} lower than for the L-forms of the sugars. The activity of the enzyme with hexoses, <b>deoxysugars,</b> and sugar phosphates was only about 5 to 10 % of the rate with pentoses.

Incubation of these recombinant strains with the erythromycin aglycon (erythronolide B) gave rise to two new glycosylated compounds, identified as l- 3 -O-olivosyl- and l- 3 -O-oleandrosyl-erythronolide B, indicating that pOLV and pOLE encode all enzyme activities required for the biosynthesis of these two 2, 6 -dideoxysugars.

In this work, the biosynthetic pathway of TDP-forosamine, which is a 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetradeoxy sugar component of the potent, and environmentally benign insecticide spinosyn, has been established without ambiguity. Five genes, spnO, spnN, spnQ, spnR, and spnS have been cloned from Saccharopolyspora spinosa chromosomal DNA and expressed in E. coli.

Results: A 60 -kb section of the S. viridochromogenes Tü 57 chromosome containing genes involved in avilamycin biosynthesis was sequenced. Analysis of the DNA sequence revealed 54 open reading frames. Based on the putative function of the gene products a model for avilamycin biosynthesis is proposed.

Spinosyns are macrolides with a 21 -carbon, tetracyclic lactone backbone to which the <b>deoxysugars</b> forosamine and tri-O-methylrhamnose are attached. Ac-cording to the pathway and regulation of spinosad biosynthesis, a rational selection procedure with u. v. mutation was performed to obtain high spinosad producing strain.

40|$|Significant {{achievements}} in polyketide gene expres-sion have made Escherichia coli {{one of the}} most promising hosts for the heterologous production of pharmacologically important polyketides. However, attempts to produce glycosylated polyketides, by the expression of heterologous sugar pathways, have been hampered until now by the low levels of glyco-sylated compounds produced by the recombinant hosts. By carrying out metabolic engineering of three endogenous pathways that lead to the synthesis of TDP sugars in E. coli, we have greatly improved the intracellular levels of the common <b>deoxysugar</b> intermediate TDP- 4 -keto- 6 -deoxyglucose resulting in increased production of the heterologous sugars TDP-L-mycarose and TDP-D-desosamine, both com-ponents of medically important polyketides. Bio-conversion experiments carried out by feeding 6 -deoxyerythronolide B (6 -dEB) or 3 -a-mycaro-sylerythronolide B (MEB) demonstrated that the genetically modified E. coli B strain was able to produce 60 - and 25 -fold more erythromycin D (EryD) than the original strain K 207 - 3, respectively. More-over, the additional knockout of the multidrug efflux pump AcrAB further improved the ability of the engi-neered strain to produce these glycosylated com-pounds. These results open the possibility of using E. coli as a generic host for the industrial scale produc-tion of glycosylated polyketides, and to combine the polyketide and <b>deoxysugar</b> combinatorial ap-proaches with suitable glycosyltransferases to yield massive libraries of novel compounds with variations in both the aglycone and the tailoring sugars...|$|E

Results: A DNA region of 123, 580 base pairs from the S. noursei ATCC 11455 genome was isolated, sequenced and shown by gene disruption to be involved in nystatin biosynthesis. Analysis of the DNA sequence resulted in identification of six genes encoding a modular polyketide synthase (PKS), genes for thioesterase, <b>deoxysugar</b> biosynthesis, modification, transport and regulatory proteins. One of the PKS-encoding genes, nysC, was found to encode the largest (11, 096 amino acids long) modular PKS described to date.

40|$|Crystal {{structures}} of complexes of D-xylose isomerase with <b>deoxysugars</b> have been determined. Deoxynojirimycin is a structural analogue of alpha-pyranose and mimics the binding of these aldose substrates. The structure of this complex supports {{the hypothesis that}} an imidazole group catalyzes ring opening of the pyranose. The steric restrictions in the active site of the enzyme prevent a beta-pyranose from binding in the same way. For the reverse reaction with ketoses, the anomeric specificity is less certain. Dideoxyimino-D-glucitol is a structural analogue of the ketose alpha-D-furanose. The binding of the inhibitor dideoxyimino-D-glucitol to the crystals of the enzyme does not mimic the binding of the reactive alpha-D-fructofuranose. Superposition of the nonphysiological substrate alpha-D-fructofuranose onto the atomic positions of dideoxyimino-D-glucitol is not possible due to the steric restrictions of the active site. However, by utilizing the approximate 2 -fold symmetry of the sugar, a stereochemically sensible model is produced {{which is consistent with}} other data. In addition to reaction with alpha-D-furanose, the enzyme probably reacts with open ring keto sugars which are present at significant concentrations.

Degenerate polyketide synthase (PKS) -specific primers were used to amplify DNA fragments from S. bikiniensis with very high identity to a unique ketosynthase domain of the tylosin PKS. The resulting amplimers were used to identify two overlapping cosmids encompassing the chm PKS. Sequencing revealed a contiguous segment of > 60 kb carrying 25 putative genes for biosynthesis of the polyketide backbone, the two <b>deoxysugars,</b> and enzymes involved in modification of precursors of chalcomycin or resistance to it. The chm PKS lacks the ketoreductase and dehydratase domains in the seventh module expected to produce the 2, 3 -double bond in chalcomycin. Expression of PKS in the heterologous host Streptomyces fradiae, from which the tyl genes encoding the PKS had been removed, resulted in production of at least one novel compound, characterized as a 3 -keto 16 -membered macrolactone in equilibrium with its 3 -trans enol tautomer and containing the sugar mycaminose at the C- 5 position, in agreement with the structure predicted {{on the basis of the}} domain organization of the chm PKS. The production of a 3 -keto macrolide from the chm PKS indicates that a discrete set of enzymes is responsible for the introduction of the 2, 3 -trans double bond in chalcomycin.

EiJacob 1 has five tandemly arrayed, six-Cys chitin-binding domains separated by low-complexity Ser- and Thr-rich spacers. E. histolytica also has numerous predicted Jessie lectins and chitinases, which contain a single, N-terminal eight-Cys chitin-binding domain. We hypothesized that E. invadens cyst walls are composed entirely of proteins with six-Cys or eight-Cys chitin-binding domains {{and that some of}} these proteins contain sugars. E. invadens genomic sequences predicted seven Jacob lectins, five Jessie lectins, and three chitinases. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that mRNAs encoding Jacobs, Jessies, and chitinases are increased during E. invadens encystation, while mass spectrometry showed that the cyst wall is composed of an ∼ 30 : 70 mix of Jacob lectins (cross-linking proteins) and Jessie and chitinase lectins (possible enzymes). Three Jacob lectins were cleaved prior to Lys at conserved sites (e. g., TPSVDK) in the Ser- and Thr-rich spacers between chitin-binding domains. A model peptide was cleaved at the same site by papain and E. invadens Cys proteases, suggesting that the latter cleave Jacob lectins in vivo. Some Jacob lectins had O-phosphodiester-linked carbohydrates, which were one to seven hexoses long and had <b>deoxysugars</b> at reducing ends. We concluded that the major protein components of the E. invadens cyst wall all contain chitin-binding domains (chitinases, Jessie lectins, and Jacob lectins) and that the Jacob lectins are differentially modified by site-specific Cys proteases and O-phosphodiester-linked glycans...|$|R

Modified versions of this minimal gene set produced novel mono- and disaccharide avermectins. The results provide further insight into the biosynthesis of L-oleandrose. Conclusions: The plasmid-based reconstruction of the avr <b>deoxysugar</b> genes for expression in a heterologous system combined with biotransformation has led to new information about the mechanism of 2, 6 -deoxysugar biosynthesis. The structures of the di-demethyldeoxysugar avermectins accumulated indicate that in the oleandrose pathway the stereochemistry at C- 3 is ultimately determined by the 3 -O-methyltransferase and not by the 3 -ketoreductase or a possible 3, 5 -epimerase. The AvrF protein is therefore a 5 -epimerase and not a 3, 5 -epimerase. The ability of the AvrB (mono-) glycosyltransferase to accommodate different <b>deoxysugar</b> intermediates {{is evident from the}} structures of the novel avermectins produced...|$|E
40|$|Die Aminocoumarin-Antibiotika Novobiocin, Clorobiocin und Coumermycin A 1 werden von verschiedenen Streptomycetenarten gebildet und sind Hemmstoffe der bakteriellen DNA-Gyrase. Ihre therapeutische Anwendung blieb jedoch durch ihre schlechte Wasserlöslichkeit, die geringe Aktivität gegenüber gram-negativen Bakterien und ihre relativ hohe Toxizität in Eukaryonten eingeschränkt. Für die Gewinnung neuer strukturell modifizierter Aminocoumarin-Antibiotika durch genetische Manipulation benötigt man genaue Informationen über die Biosynthese dieser Antibiotika. Die Biosynthesegencluster dieser drei Antibiotika sind bereits kloniert, sequenziert und die Funktion vieler Gene aufgeklärt. Dennoch bedarf es immer noch weiteren gezielten Untersuchungen, um die Biosynthese vollständig zu verstehen. Clorobiocin enthält einen Pyrrol- 2 -carboxylteil, der über eine Esterbindung mit dem Desoxyzucker verbunden ist. Dieser Pyrrolteil ist wichtig für die Bindung des Antibiotikums an sein biologisches Target. Die Gene, die an der Biosynthese dieser 5 -Methylpyrrol- 2 -carbonsäure-Einheit beteiligt sind sowie die für die Übertragung der Acylkomponente auf den Desoxyzucker und dessen Modifizierung verantwortlich sind, konnten bereits durch Geninaktivierung, Expression und biochemische Untersuchungen identifiziert werden. Dabei handelt es sich um cloN 2, cloN 3, cloN 4, cloN 5 und cloN 6. Im Cluster von Clorobiocin treten aber noch zwei weitere Gene cloN 1 und cloN 7 auf, die zu dieser Gengruppe gehören. Ein Ziel dieser Arbeit war die Funktion dieser beiden Gene durch Geninaktivierung aufzuklären. Beide Mutationen resultierten in der Akkumulation der gleichen Sekundärmetabolite: Novclobiocin 104 und Pyrrol- 2 -carbonsäure. Dieses Ergebnis zeigte, dass CloN 1 und CloN 7 zusammen mit CloN 2 für den Transfer des Pyrrol- 2 -carboxylteils von dem Acylcarrierprotein CloN 5 auf den Desoxyzucker des Clorobiocins verantwortlich sind. Clorobiocin, Novobiocin und Coumermycin A 1 enthalten als gemeinsames Strukturelement einen ungewöhnlichen Desoxyzucker mit einer 5, 5 -Dimethylstruktur. Die Biosynthese dieses Desoxyzuckers beinhaltet eine C-Methylierungsreaktion, die in anderen Desoxyzucker-Biosynthesewegen noch nicht beschrieben worden ist. Deshalb war eine weiterer Schwerpunkt dieser Arbeit diesen Methylierungsschritt näher zu charakterisieren. Die Inaktivierung des putativen C-Methyltransferasegens cloU im Clorobiocin-Cluster führte zu einem Verlust der axialen Methylgruppe an Position 5 des Desoxyzuckers. Somit konnte die Funktion von cloU als C-Methyltransferase nachgewiesen werden. Gleichzeitig beweist es aber auch, das die Biosynthese des Desoxyzuckerteils von Clorobiocin über eine 3, 5 -Epimerisierung des dTDP- 4 -Keto- 6 -Desoxyglucose-Intermediats verläuft. Die cloU-Defektmutante akkumulierte die Aminocoumarine jedoch vorwiegend in Form der Aglyka und nur geringe Mengen in Form der Glykoside. So war eine weitere Aufgabe, die Ursache für diese geringe Glykosylierungseffizienz zu finden. Eine heterologe Expression von einem Teil des Elloramycin-Biosynthesegenclustern in der cloU-Defektmutante zeigte, dass die Synthese der dTDP-L-Rhamnose der limitierende Faktor für die Aminocoumarin-glykosidbildung war, und nicht wie vorher erwartet der Glykosyltransfer. Um nun diese Limitation zu beheben, wurden Genkonstrukte, die verschiedene Desoxyzucker-biosynthesegene enthielten, in die cloU-Defektmutante eingebracht. Das Plasmid pRHAM, welches die Gene oleL, oleS, oleE und oleU vom Oleandomycin-Cluster enthält und zusammen dTDP-L-Rhamnose bilden, führte zu einer 26 -fachen Produktionssteigerung der glykosylierten Aminocoumarine. Eine Expression der 4 -Ketoreduktase OleU alleine resultierte mit einer 8 -fachen Steigerung. Diese Ergebnisse zeigten, dass die 4 -Ketoreduktase CloS eine hohe Spezifität für C- 5 -methylierte Intermediate aufweist. Des weiteren konnten die drei neuen Antibiotika Vanillobiocin, Isovanillobiocin und Declovanillobiocin aus dem Kulturmedium einer cloQ-Defektmutante von S. roseochromogenes DS 12. 976, die in der Biosynthese der prenylierten 4 -Hydroxybenzoesäure des Clorobiocins blockiert ist, isoliert werden. Spektroskopische Untersuchungen zeigten, dass die isolierten Verbindungen eine ähnliche Struktur wie Clorobiocin aufwiesen. Jedoch enthielten die neuen Verbindungen anstelle der prenylierten 4 -Hydroxybenzoesäure die Vanillinsäure als Acylkomponente. Außerdem wurde die Bildung der zentralen Pyrroleinheit, der 3 -Methylpyrrol- 2, 4 -dicarbonsäure, von Coumermycin A 1 untersucht. Inaktivierung der Gene couR 1 -couR 4 im Coumermycin A 1 -Produzenten S. rishiriensis führte zu Mutanten, die kein Coumermycin A 1 mehr produzierten. Jedoch konnte durch anschließende Fütterung der Mutanten mit 3, 5 -Dimethylpyrrol- 2, 4 -dicarbonsäure keine Wiederherstellung der Coumermycin A 1 -Produktion erzielt werden. Somit konnte die genaue Funktion der Gene couR 1 -couR 4 noch nicht nachgewiesen werden. The aminocoumarin {{antibiotics}} novobiocin, clorobiocin and coumermycin A 1 {{are produced}} by various Streptomyces strains and are inhibitors of the bacterial DNA-gyrase. Their therapeutic application has been limited, however, by the poor water solubility, low activity against gram-negative bacteria and toxicity in eukaryotes. More information on the biosynthesis is required to develop new, structurally modified aminocoumarin antibiotics by genetic manipulation. The biosynthetic gene clusters of these three antibiotics have already been cloned, sequenced and the function {{of most of the}} genes have been elucidated previously. Nevertheless, more investigation is necessary to understand their biosynthesis completely. Clorobiocin and coumermycin A 1 contain 5 -methylpyrrole- 2 -carboxyl moieties, attached to a <b>deoxysugar</b> via an ester bond. Correspondingly, seven genes clo/couN 1 to clo/couN 7 are located in the gene clusters of clorobiocin and coumermycin A 1, but not in the cluster of novobiocin. By gene inactivation experiments and biochemical investigations, it has been proven that the genes cloN 2, cloN 3, cloN 4, cloN 5 and cloN 6 are involved in the biosynthesis of the 5 -methylpyrrole unit and its transfer to the <b>deoxysugar</b> as well as its modification. However, the function of cloN 1 and cloN 7 in the clorobiocin cluster remained to be investigated. The aim of this work was the clarification of the function of these two genes by gene inactivation experiments. Both mutations resulted in the accumulation of the same secondary metabolites: novclobiocin 104 and pyrrole- 2 -carboxylic acid. The results proved that CloN 1 and CloN 7 - in addition to CloN 2 - are required for the transfer of the pyrrole- 2 -carboxyl moiety from the acyl carrier protein CloN 5 to the <b>deoxysugar</b> moiety of clorobiocin. Clorobiocin, novobiocin and coumermycin A 1 contain an unusual branched 5, 5 -gem-dimethyl <b>deoxysugar</b> with as a common structural element. The biosynthesis of this <b>deoxysugar</b> includes a C-methylation reaction which has not yet been described in other <b>deoxysugar</b> biosynthesis. Therefore a further aim of this work was a more detailed investigation of this methylation step. The inactivation of the putative C-methyltransferase gene cloU in the clorobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster led to the loss of the axial methyl group at C- 5 of the <b>deoxysugar</b> moiety of clorobiocin. This proved that the function of the cloU gene product is a C-methyltransferase in the biosynthesis of this antibiotic. At the same time it proves that the biosynthesis of the <b>deoxysugar</b> moiety of clorobiocin proceeds via a 3, 5 -epimerization of the dTDP- 4 -keto- 6 -deoxyglucose intermediate. Aminocoumarins accumulated in cloU-defective mutants predominantly in the aglyca form and only small amounts in the glycoside form. Investigation on the reason of the low glycosylation effiency in the mutant was a further aim of the project. Heterologous expression of a partial elloramycin biosynthetic gene cluster indicated that the rate of dTDP-L-rhamnose synthesis, rather than the rate of glycosyl transfer, was limiting for glycoside formation in this strain. To circumvent this limitation, gene constructs containing various <b>deoxysugar</b> biosynthesis genes were introduced into the cloU-defective mutant. Introduction of the the plasmid pRHAM containing the genes oleL, oleS, oleE and oleU the biosynthesis of dTDP-L-rhamnose from the oleandomycin biosynthetic gene cluster led to a 26 -fold increase of the production of glycosylated aminocoumarins. Expression of the 4 -ketoreductase OleU alone resulted in an 8 -fold increase. These results indicated that the 4 -ketoreductase CloS is quite specific for the 5 -C-methylated intermediate. In addition, three new antibiotics, vanillobiocin, isovanillobiocin and declovanillobiocin, could be isolated from the culture broth of a cloQ-defective mutant of the clorobiocin producer S. roseochromogenes DS 12. 976 which is blocked in the biosynthesis of the prenylated 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid moiety of clorobiocin. Spectroscopic analysis showed that the isolated compounds are structurally similar to clorobiocin but contain vanillic acid as the acyl component instead of the prenylated 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid present in clorobiocin. Furthermore the formation of the central pyrrole unit, the 3 -methylpyrrole- 2, 4 -dicarboxylic acid, of coumermycin A 1 was investigated. Inactivation of the genes couR 1 -couR 4 in the coumermycin A 1 producer S. rishiriensis led to mutants which do not produce coumermycin A 1. However, the coumermycin A 1 production could not be regenerated by supplementing the mutant with 3, 5 -dimethylpyrrole- 2, 4 -dicarboxylic acid. Consequently, the exact function of the couR 1 -couR 4 genes could not yet be demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Tetrocarcin A (TCA), {{produced}} by Micromonospora chalcea NRRL 11289, is a spirotetronate antibiotic with potent antitumor activity and versatile modes of action. In this study, the biosynthetic gene cluster of TCA was cloned and localized to a 108 -kb contiguous DNA region. In silico sequence analysis revealed 36 putative genes that constitute this cluster (including 11 for unusual sugar biosynthesis, 13 for aglycone formation, and 4 for glycosylations) and {{allowed us to}} propose the biosynthetic pathway of TCA. The formation of d-tetronitrose, l-amicetose, and l-digitoxose may begin with d-glucose- 1 -phosphate, share early enzymatic steps, and branch into different pathways by competitive actions of specific enzymes. Tetronolide biosynthesis involves the incorporation of a 3 -C unit with a polyketide intermediate to form the characteristic spirotetronate moiety and trans-decalin system. Further substitution of tetronolide with five <b>deoxysugars</b> (one being a deoxynitrosugar) was likely due to the activities of four glycosyltransferases. In vitro characterization of the first enzymatic step by utilization of 1, 3 -biphosphoglycerate as the substrate and in vivo cross-complementation of the bifunctional fused gene tcaD 3 (with the functions of chlD 3 and chlD 4) to ΔchlD 3 and ΔchlD 4 in chlorothricin biosynthesis supported the highly conserved tetronate biosynthetic strategy in the spirotetronate family. Deletion of a large DNA fragment encoding polyketide synthases resulted in a non-TCA-producing strain, providing a clear background for the identification of novel analogs. These findings provide insights into spirotetronate biosynthesis and demonstrate that combinatorial-biosynthesis methods {{can be applied to}} the TCA biosynthetic machinery to generate structural diversity...|$|R
40|$|The {{cyanobacterium}} Gloeothece sp. strain PCC 6909 and its sheathless mutant {{were tested}} for {{their abilities to}} remove copper ions from aqueous solutions, {{with the aim of}} defining the role of the various outermost polysaccharidic investments in the removal of the metal ions. Microscopy studies and chemical analyses revealed that, although the mutant does not possess a sheath, it releases large amounts of polysaccharidic material (released exocellular polysaccharides [RPS]) into the culture medium. The RPS of the wild type and the mutant are composed of the same 11 sugars, although they are present in different amounts, and the RPS of the mutant possesses a larger amount of acidic sugars and a smaller amount of <b>deoxysugars</b> than the wild type. Unexpectedly, whole cultures of the mutant were more effective in the removal of the heavy metal than the wild type (46. 3 ± 3. 1 and 26. 7 ± 1. 5 mg of Cu 2 + removed per g of dry weight, respectively). Moreover, we demonstrated that the contribution of the sheath to the metal-removal capacity of the wild type is scarce and that the RPS of the mutant is more efficient in removing copper. This suggests that the metal ions are preferably bound to the cell wall and to RPS functional groups rather than to the sheath. Therefore, the increased copper binding efficiency observed with the sheathless mutant {{can be attributed to the}} release of a polysaccharide containing larger amounts and/or more accessible functional groups (e. g., carboxyl and amide groups) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Coxiella burnetii is Gram-negative {{bacterium}} {{responsible for}} the zoonosis Q-fever. While it has an obligate intracellular growth habit, {{it is able to}} persist for extended periods outside of a host cell and can resist environmental conditions that would be lethal to most prokaryotes. It is these extracellular bacteria that are the infectious stage encountered by eukaryotic hosts. The intracellular form has evolved to grow and replicate within acidified parasitophorous vacuoles. The outer coat of C. burnetii comprises a complex lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component that includes the unique methylated- 6 -deoxyhexose, virenose. Although potentially important as a biomarker for C. burnetii, the pathway for its biosynthesis remains obscure. Results The 6 -deoxyhexoses constitute a large family integral to the LPS of many eubacteria. It is believed that precursors of the methylated-deoxyhexoses traverse common early biosynthetic steps as nucleotide-monosaccharides. As a prelude to a full biosynthetic characterization, we present herein the results from bioinformatics-based, proteomics-supported predictions of the pathway for virenose synthesis. Alternative possibilities are considered which include both GDP-mannose and TDP-glucose as precursors. Conclusion We propose that biosynthesis of the unique C. burnetii biomarker, virenose, involves an early pathway similar to that of other C- 3 ’-methylated <b>deoxysugars</b> which then diverges depending upon the nucleotide-carrier involved. The alternatives yield either the D- or L-enantiomers of virenose. Both pathways require five enzymatic steps, beginning with either glucose- 6 -phosphate or mannose- 6 -phosphate. Our in silico results comprise a model for virenose biosynthesis that can be directly tested. Definition of this pathway should facilitate the development of therapeutic agents useful for treatment of Q fever, as well as allowing improvements in the methods for diagnosing this highly infectious disease. </p...|$|R

Involvement of the cluster in chromomycin A 3 biosynthesis was demonstrated by disrupting the cmmWI gene encoding a polyketide reductase involved in side chain reduction.

An insertional inactivation experiment with a dNDP-glucose 4, 6 -dehydratase fragment resulted in abolishment of novobiocin production, since biosynthesis of the <b>deoxysugar</b> moiety of novobiocin was blocked.

40|$|In recent years, the {{glycopeptide}} antibiotics {{have emerged}} as the drugs of choice {{in the treatment of}} potentially life-threatening infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococi faeium. However, with the global emergence of glycopeptide-resistant bacteria over the past decade, there are few effective antibiotic treatments remaining and the development of novel therapeutic agents it vital. As a result of the structural complexity of glycopeptide antibiotics, chemical modification often proves difficult, and consequently their biosynthesis is of great interest. Characterisation of the biosynthetic pathways producing these antibiotics could form the basis for the design and synthesis of novel antibiotics with potentially increased antibacterial activity. Chloroeremomycin is comprised of a core, which consists of mainly non-proteinogenic amino acids. The heptapeptide backbone is further modified by cross-linking, chlorination and glycosylation. The work presented in this thesis describes the study of proteins putatively involved in the biosynthesis of the unusual amino acid b-hydroxytyrosine and the 4 - epi -vancosamine <b>deoxysugar</b> components of chloroeremomycin. The investigation of the function of a putative peptide synthetase potentially involved in the biosynthesis of b-hydroxytyrosine is described. Mass spectrometry was used to detect and assign peptide fragments generated by the digestion of the peptide synthetase in an effort to identify the peptide loaded with the 4 ’-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group and subsequently L-tyrosine. In addition, analysis of the function of a putative cytochrome P- 450 monooxygenase as the enzyme responsible for catalysing the β-hydroxylation of L-tyrosine whilst it is covalently-bound to the peptide synthetase is described. Lastly, the function of an enzyme responsible for catalysing the 2, 3 -dehydration of TDP- 4 -keto- 6 -deoxyglucose, {{the first step in the}} biosynthetic pathway producing the <b>deoxysugar</b> 4 - epi -vancosamine, is confirmed.

40|$|BackgroundMithramycin is {{a member}} of the {{clinically}} important aureolic acid group of antitumor drugs that interact with GC-rich regions of DNA nonintercalatively. These drugs contain a chromophore aglycon that is derived from condensation of ten acetate units (catalyzed by a type II polyketide synthase). The aglycones are glycosylated at two positions with different chain length deoxyoligosaccharides, which are essential for the antitumor activity. During the early stages of mithramycin biosynthesis, tetracyclic intermediates of the tetracycline-type occur, which must be converted at later stages into the tricyclic glycosylated molecule, presumably through oxidative breakage of the fourth ring. ResultsTwo intermediates in the mithramycin biosynthetic pathway, 4 -demethylpremithramycinone and premithramycin B, were identified in a mutant lacking the mithramycin glycosyltransferase and methyltransferase genes and in the same mutant complemented with the deleted genes, respectively. Premithramycin B contains five <b>deoxysugars</b> moieties (like mithramycin), but contains a tetracyclic aglycon moiety instead of a tricyclic aglycon. We hypothesized that transcription of mtmOIV (encoding an oxygenase) was impaired in this strain, preventing oxidative breakage of the fourth ring of premithramycin B. Inactivating mtmOIV generated a mithramycin nonproducing mutant that accumulated premithramycin B instead of mithramycin. In vitro assays demonstrated that MtmOIV converted premithramycin B into a tricyclic compound. ConclusionsIn the late stages of mithramycin biosynthesis by Strepyomyces argillaceus, a fully glycosylated tetracyclic tetracycline-like intermediate (premithramycin B) is converted into a tricyclic compound by the oxygenase MtmOIV. This oxygenase inserts an oxygen (Baeyer-Villiger oxidation) and opens the resulting lactone. The following decarboxylation and ketoreduction steps lead to mithramycin. Opening of the fourth ring represents one of the last steps in mithramycin biosynthesis. Jürgen Rohr (chemical communications; please use US address 3) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Spinosad is {{a mixture}} of novel {{macrolide}} secondary metabolites produced by Saccharopolyspora spinosa. It is used in agriculture as a potent insect control agent with exceptional safety to non-target organisms. The cloning of the spinosyn biosynthetic gene cluster provides the starting materials for the molecular genetic manipulation of spinosad yields, and for the production of novel derivatives containing alterations in the polyketide core or in the attached sugars. Results: We cloned the spinosad biosynthetic genes by molecular probing, complementation of blocked mutants, and cosmid walking, and sequenced an 80 kb region. We carried out gene disruptions of some of the genes and analyzed the mutants for product formation and for the bioconversion of intermediates in the spinosyn pathway. The spinosyn gene cluster contains five large open reading frames that encode a multifunctional, multi-subunit type I polyketide synthase (PKS). The PKS cluster is flanked on one side by genes involved in the biosynthesis of the amino sugar forosamine, in O-methylations of rhamnose, in sugar attachment to the polyketide, and in polyketide cross-bridging. Genes involved in the early common steps in the biosynthesis of forosamine and rhamnose, and genes dedicated to rhamnose biosynthesis, were not located in the 80 kb cluster. Conclusions: Most of the S. spinosa genes involved in spinosyn biosynthesis are found in one 74 kb cluster, though it does not contain all of the genes required for the essential <b>deoxysugars.</b> Characterization of the clustered genes suggests that the spinosyns are synthesized largely by mechanisms similar to those used to assemble complex macrolides in other actinomycetes. However, there are several unusual genes in the spinosyn cluster that could encode enzymes that generate the most striking structural feature of these compounds, a tetracyclic polyketide aglycone nucleus...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{characterization of}} dissolved carbohydrates in the Siberian rivers and shelf areas, the Kara and Laptev Seas, the central Arctic Ocean, Fram Strait, and Greenland Sea is presented. Highest concentrations of total carbohydrates (25 mM C on average) were {{measured in the}} samples of the Russian rivers. A strong decrease of the concentrations occurred during the transition into the marine environment (5. 3 mM C on average). In deep waters, the total carbohydrate concentrations were below 2 mM C. The main component of dissolved carbohydrates was glucose, which was well suited for the characterization of the diagenetic state of DOM. Terrigenous and diagenetic old marine DOM had very low glucose proportions between 20 and 28 % of total carbohydrates. In contrast, freshly produced DOM was characterized by high glucose proportions of up to 86 %. Indicators for diagenetic modifications were also fucose, rhamnose, and arabinose, whose proportions increased with increasing diagenetic degree to approx. 40 %. The composition of refractory carbohydrates was determined by extraction of recalcitrant organic matter from the seawater {{using a combination of}} XAD- 2 and - 4 adsorption resins. With increasing age of DOM, the proportion of the humic substances of the total DOC and of the total carbohydrates increased from 45 % in surface samples to 67 % in the deep sea. Part of refractory carbohydrates may be composed of chemically modified carbohydrates, which are not accessible with the chromatographic method. More than the half of the XAD-extractable sugars of surface samples and more than 70 % of deep sea samples were found in the unpolar fraction. It was concluded that the majority of refractory carbohydrates were bound or associated to unpolar compounds of small molecular size.
