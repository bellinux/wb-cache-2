40|$|M. Ed. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the management of school <b>fees</b> <b>exemptions</b> by school principals. Due to the current financial climate in South Africa, the responsibility for financing education is shifting increasingly from the government to the private sector and the parent community in particular. Consequently schools have to generate more funds to supplement state resources. These funds are administered and managed by school-based managers. Furthermore, this concept enhances the aspect of school fees management. The first chapter of this research provided a comprehensive orientation and background of the research problem. The aim of the research was presented and the method of research was discussed. In chapter two, the researcher concentrated on a focused literature study. The literature study explored the concept of the budget; legislation and policy on school <b>fees</b> <b>exemptions,</b> accountability and transparency of principals. The research design and qualitative methodology was the subject of discussion in chapter three. An interview as a research instrument was explained. Therefore, various aspects of an interview as a research instrument were discussed. Findings of this research, which emanated both from the literature review on school <b>fees</b> <b>exemptions</b> and empirical research, revealed that poverty and unemployment are the main cause of non-payment of school fees. It was also revealed that parents are not aware of the school <b>fees</b> <b>exemptions</b> policy and that they do not apply for school <b>fees</b> <b>exemptions.</b> Another reason for non payment of school fees is the mismanagement of school fees.

40|$|User fee removal {{has been}} put forward as an {{approach}} to increasing priority health service utilization, re-ducing impoverishment, and ultimately reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. However, user fees {{are a source of}} facility revenue in many low-income countries, often used for purchasing drugs and supplies and paying incentives to health workers. This paper reviews evidence on the effects of user <b>fee</b> <b>exemptions</b> on maternal health service utilization, service provision, and outcomes, including both supply-side and demand-side effects. We reviewed 19 peer-reviewed research articles addressing user <b>fee</b> <b>exemptions</b> and maternal health services or outcomes published since 1990. Studies were identified through a USAID-commissioned call for evidence, key word search, and screening process. Teams of reviewers assigned crite-ria-based quality scores to each paper and prepared structured narrative reviews. The grade of the evidence was found to be relatively weak, mainly from short-term, non-controlled studies. The introduction of user <b>fee</b> <b>exemptions</b> appears to have resulted in increased rates of facility-based deliveries and caesarean sections in some contexts. Impacts on maternal and neonatal mortality have not been conclusively demonstrated; exemptions for delivery care may contribute to modest reductions in institutional maternal mortality but the evidence is very weak.

40|$|Abstract Background While {{more and}} more West African {{countries}} are implementing public user <b>fees</b> <b>exemption</b> policies, there is still little knowledge available on this topic. The long time required for scientific production, combined {{with the needs of}} decision-makers, led to the creation in 2010 of a project to support implementers in aggregating knowledge on their experiences. This article presents a transversal analysis of user <b>fees</b> <b>exemption</b> policies implemented in Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Togo and Senegal. Methods This was a multiple case study with several embedded levels of analysis. The cases were public user <b>fees</b> <b>exemption</b> policies selected by the participants because of their instructive value. The data used in the countries were taken from documentary analysis, interviews and questionnaires. The transversal analysis was based on a framework for studying five implementation components and five actors’ attitudes usually encountered in these policies. Results The analysis of the implementation components revealed: a majority of State financing; maintenance of centrally organized financing; a multiplicity of reimbursement methods; reimbursement delays and/or stock shortages; almost no implementation guides; a lack of support measures; communication plans that were rarely carried out, funded or renewed; health workers who were given general information but not details; poorly informed populations; almost no evaluation systems; ineffective and poorly funded coordination systems; low levels of community involvement; and incomplete referral-evacuation systems. With regard to actors’ attitudes, the analysis revealed: objectives that were appreciated by everyone; dissatisfaction with the implementation; specific tensions between healthcare providers and patients; overall satisfaction among patients, but still some problems; the perception that while the financial barrier has been removed, other barriers persist; occasionally a reorganization of practices, service rationing due to lack of reimbursement, and some overcharging or shifting of resources. Conclusions This transversal analysis confirms the need to assign a great deal of importance to the implementation of user <b>fees</b> <b>exemption</b> policies once these decisions have been taken. It also highlights some practices that suggest avenues of future research. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Antique vehicle {{registration}} may provide certain benefits, {{such as a}} reduced or waived registration <b>fee,</b> <b>exemption</b> from vehicle inspection, and/or distinctive {{vehicle registration}} plates. However, the owner's privilege of driving the vehicle may be significantly curtailed. For example, in Virginia, {{the use of a}} car registered as an antique is limited to participation in car club activities, parades, and the like, driving to and from such events, testing, obtaining maintenance and repairs, and occasional pleasure driving within 250 mi of one's residence. [...] Commuting to and from work is specifically forbidden in Virginia. While having similar rules to the Virginia example above, Tennessee does not allow transfer of antique license plates between owners when a vehicle is sold so the original owner must surrender the antique plate and the new owner must apply for a new one. As of 2009, Tennessee allows transfer of an existing antique tag from a sold vehicle by the selling owner to another antique vehicle owned by the same owner. Connecticut has no driving or registration restrictions on autos so registered. Also as of 2009 Tennessee now requires special verification by a law enforcement agency person (police officer or state trooper) {{to the fact that the}} vehicle is antique and non-modified but does require owner affidafit of same and continues prior restrictions on vehicle use by the owner. In Sweden there are no specific limits and the requirement for a yearly vehicle inspection is reduced to a bi-annual.|$|E
40|$|Financial {{barriers}} {{are an important}} obstacle for access to emergency obstetric care and a contributing factor to too slow {{a reduction in the}} level of maternal mortality. In Morocco, in 2009, a <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policy for delivery and caesarean section was implemented in public maternity hospitals. As in most countries where a <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policy has been implemented, <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> is considered synonym to free care. However, other direct costs may subsist. The objective {{of this study was to}} get an estimate of the actual cost of caesarean sections from the patients ’ perspective. This study was carried out in April 2010 in the three public hospitals in Fez. We carried out semi-structured interviews among a sample of 100 women who gave birth by caesarian section in the public hospitals in Fez. The results showed that households paid between US$ 169 (95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 153, 185) at the provincial and regional hospitals, and US$ 291 (95 % CI: 224 - 359) at the university hospital (UH) where the <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> was not applied. The direct cost of a caesarean was mainly influenced by the price of the drugs the families bought, the invoice paid at UH, and the transport. Finally, although the <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policy for caesareans has probably reduced the total cost for households who did not have access to a poverty card, it has not led to ‘truly ’ free caesarean deliveries...|$|E
40|$|Education {{policies}} {{remain a}} contested terrain {{in both the}} social and political environments. They are not neutral instruments and are used both to maintain the existing social order and also to promote varying kinds of change or mobility. The South African Schools Act, 1996 (Act 84 of 1996) hereafter SASA, which is the source of all policies that regulate school issues in South Africa promotes democratic methods of school governing and education provisioning that favours the previously disadvantaged groups. The NNSSF is one of the policies of SASA that makes schooling accessible to the poor through school <b>fee</b> <b>exemptions</b> while attempting to close the gap between {{the rich and the poor}} through differentiated school funding created according to researched poverty levels and standardized target lists. This has been designed to fulfil one of the essential human rights of man- education that has been entrenched in the Bill of Rights of the Republic of South Africa Constitution, 1996 (Act 108 of 1996) hereafter, Constitution. Thus, the study’s objective is to evaluate the implementation of the NNSSF policy in public schools focussing on school <b>fee</b> <b>exemptions.</b> The extent to which poor parents and learners are given school <b>fee</b> <b>exemptions</b> as they are supposed to according to the policy will be indicators of whether the NNSSF is justly or unjustly implemented in public schools. Learners are the recipients of the right to education. Parents are given the responsibility to fund the education of their children. However, for poor parents to fulfil that they need advice and assistance from the teachers and SGBs to be able to access the school <b>fee</b> <b>exemptions</b> while they have a right to just administrative action and to human dignity in dealing with them. SGBs and teachers have to create a favourable environment for the just implementation of the NNSSF by advising and xiii assisting deserving parents and learners to access school <b>fee</b> <b>exemptions</b> so that the right to education is fulfilled. The duty of in loco parentis and acting in the best interest of the child enforce teachers to do everything possible to ensure that learners access education. EDOs are supposed to guide, monitor and supervise the implementation of the policy while legal bodies should assist parents and learners to demand their right when it is violated through litigation. The study used the method of survey which is quantitative and interviews which are qualitative. Questionnaires and interview schedules were tools used to collect data that was analysed through statistical methods and represented in the form of tables and pie-charts. Various significant findings were made that had a bearing on the implementation of the NNSSF policy in public schools, most important to note is that some learners who have the right to education are aware of this right but do not know how to ensure that it is not violated. Parents are not given the opportunity to decide whether school fees should be charged in their schools. Above that they are not given the advice they need to be able to access school <b>fee</b> <b>exemptions.</b> Some teachers think that by advising and assisting learners and parents they will be buying cheap popularity- showing ignorance. EDOs do not know how schools implement the NNSSF, they are not involved in anyway. Thus the study views the implementation of NNSSF policy in public schools as unjust and recommends that SGBs and teachers need to be educated, guided and monitored by the EDOs on the policy and its implementation. They in turn will have to educate parents and learners so that they are able to access school <b>fee</b> <b>exemptions</b> thereby receiving education – their right...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Several {{countries}} have instituted <b>fee</b> <b>exemptions</b> for caesareans to reduce maternal and newborn mortality. Objectives: To evaluate {{the effect of}} <b>fee</b> <b>exemptions</b> for caesareans on population caesarean rates taking into account different levels of accessibility. Methods: The observation period was from January 2003 to May 2012 in one Region and covered 11. 7 million person-years. <b>Exemption</b> <b>fees</b> for caesareans were adopted on June 26, 2005. Data were obtained from a registration system implemented in 2003 that tracks all obstetrical emergencies and interventions including caesareans. The pre-intervention period was 30 months and the post-intervention period was 83 months. We used an interrupted time series to evaluate the trend {{before and after the}} policy adoption and the overall tendency. Findings: During the study period, the caesarean rate increased from 0. 25 to 1. 5 % for the entire population. For women living in cities with district hospitals that provided caesareans, the rate increased from 1. 7 % before the policy was enforced to 5. 7 % 83 months later. No significant change in trends was observed among women living in villages with a healthcare centre or those in villages with no healthcare facility. For the latter, the caesarean rate increased from 0. 4 to 1 %. Conclusions: After nine years of implementation policy in Mali, the caesarean rate achieved in cities with a district hospital reached the full beneficial effect of this measure, whereas for women living elsewhere this policy did not increase the caesarean rate to a level that could contribute effectively to reduce their risk of maternal death. Only universal access to this essential intervention could reduce the inequities and increase the effectiveness of this policy...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{importance}} of complexity {{in health care}} policy-making and interventions, as well as research and evaluation is now widely acknowledged, but conceptual confusion reigns and few applications of complexity concepts in research design have been published. Taking user <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policies as an entry point, we explore the methodological consequences of ‘complexity’ for health policy research and evaluation. We first discuss the difference between simple, complicated and complex and introduce key concepts of complex adaptive systems theory. We then apply these to <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policies. Design We describe how the FEMHealth research project attempts to address the challenges of complexity in its evaluation of <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policies for maternal care. We present how {{the development of a}} programme theory for <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policies was used to structure the overall design. This allowed for structured discussions on the hypotheses held by theresearchers and helped to structure, integrate and monitor the sub-studies. We then show how the choice of data collection methods and tools for each sub-study was informed by the overall design. Discussion Applying key concepts from complexity theory proved useful in broadening our view on <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policies and in developing the overall research design. However, we encountered a number of challenges, including maintaining adaptiveness of the design during the evaluation, and ensuring cohesion in the disciplinary diversity of the research teams. Whether the programme theory can fulfil its claimed potential to help making sense of the findings is yet to be tested. Experience from other studies allows for some moderate optimism. However, the biggest challenge complexity throws at health system researchers may be to deal with the unknown unknowns and the consequence that complex issues can only be understood in retrospect. From a complexity theory point of view, only plausible explanations can be developed, not predictive theories. Yet here, theory-driven approaches may help...|$|E
40|$|Background Four {{years prior}} to the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) deadline, low- and middle-income {{countries}} and international stakeholders are looking for evidence-based policies to improve access to healthcare for the most vulnerable populations. User <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policies are one of the potential solutions. However, the evidence is disparate, and systematic reviews have failed to provide valuable lessons. The authors propose to produce an innovative synthesis of the available evidence on user <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policies in Africa to feed the policy-making process. Methods The authors will carry out a realist review to answer the following research question: what are the outcomes of user <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policies implemented in Africa? why do they produce such outcomes? and what contextual elements come into play? This type of review aims to understand how contextual elements influence the production of outcomes through the activation of specific mechanisms, in the form of context-mechanism-outcome configurations. The review will be conducted in five steps: (1) identifying with key stakeholders the mechanisms underlying user <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policies to develop the analytical framework, (2) searching for and selecting primary data, (3) assessing the quality of evidence using the Mixed-Method Appraisal Tool, (4) extracting the data using the analytical framework and (5) synthesising the data in the form of context-mechanism-outcomes configurations. The output will be a middle-range theory specifying how user <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policies work, for what populations and under what circumstances. Ethics and dissemination The two main target audiences are researchers who are looking for examples to implement a realist review, and policy-makers and international stakeholders looking for lessons learnt on user <b>fee</b> <b>exemption.</b> For the latter, a knowledge-sharing strategy involving local scientific and policy networks will be implemented.

40|$|This paper uses a {{regression}} discontinuity design {{to measure the}} impact of exemptions from school fees on the desegregation of formerly white and coloured schools in post-apartheid South Africa. Schools which were designated for whites under apartheid often charge high fees, equal to {{a substantial portion of}} average black and coloured households' income. Consequently, policy makers have worried that fees act as a mechanism for de facto racial segregation in schools, and have created income-tested <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policies to counteract this effect. However, I find no evidence that eligibility for a <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> increases the probability that a black student will attend a formerly coloured or white school, or that a coloured student will attend a formerly white school. I also find no statistically significant relationship between income and school choice for black students, and a small, significant relationship for coloured students. The results of this analysis show that income and fees, contrary to conventional wisdom, may not be key factors in the choice between racially defined school categories. This finding calls into question the relevance of the current <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policy, and suggests that we need to develop a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics of race and inequality in South African schools...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Although many {{developing}} countries have developed user <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policies to move towards universal health coverage as a priority, very few studies have attempted to measure the quality of care. The present paper aims at assessing whether women’s satisfaction with delivery care is maintained with a total <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> in Burkina Faso. Methods A quasi-experimental design with both intervention and control groups was carried out. Six health centres were selected in rural health districts with limited resources. In the intervention group, delivery care is free of charge at health centres while in the control district women have to pay 900 West African CFA francs (U$ 2). A total of 870 women who delivered at the health centre were interviewed at home after their visit over a 60 -day range. A series of principal component analyses (PCA) were carried out to identify the dimension of patients’ satisfaction. Results Women’s satisfaction loaded satisfactorily on a three-dimension principal component analysis (PCA) : 1 -provider-patient interaction; 2 -nursing care services; 3 -environment. Women in both the intervention and control groups were satisfied or very satisfied in 90 % of cases (in 31 of 34 items). For each dimension, average satisfaction was similar between the two groups, even after controlling for socio-demographic factors (p[*]=[*] 0. 436, p[*]=[*] 0. 506, p[*]=[*] 0. 310, respectively). The effects of total <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> on satisfaction were similar for any women without reinforcing inequalities between very poor and wealthy women (p[*]≥[*] 0. 05). Although the wealthiest women were more dissatisfied with the delivery environment (p[*]=[*] 0. 017), the poorest were more highly satisfied with nursing care services (p[*]=[*] 0. 009). Conclusion Contrary to our expectations, total <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> {{at the point of}} service did not seem to {{have a negative impact on}} quality of care, and women’s perceptions remained very positive. This paper shows that the policy of completely abolishing user fees with organized implementation is certainly a way for developing countries to engage in universal coverage while maintaining the quality of care...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Little {{rigorous}} {{evidence exists}} on how health service utilization varies across socioeconomic groups after a user <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> {{policy has been}} implemented, and the evidence that does exist is mixed. In this paper, we estimate the distribution of caesarean section deliveries across socioeconomic groups following Mali’s implementation of a <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policy for caesareans in 2005. Methods We conducted a patient survey in 2010 to collect socioeconomic data from 2, 477 women who had caesareans in {{a representative sample of}} 25 facilities across all regions of Mali. We used these data along with data from the most recent Demographic and Health Survey to construct a wealth index and classify women into population-based wealth groupings. We compared the wealth distribution of women delivering via caesarean section to that of a nationally representative sample of women giving birth. Results We found that wealthier women make up a disproportionate share of those having free caesareans, five years after implementation of the <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policy. Women in the richest two quintiles accounted for 58 percent of all caesareans, while women in the poorest two quintiles accounted for 27 percent of all caesareans. Fewer women in the poorest two-fifths of the population are receiving caesareans than what we would expect given their share in the population of women giving birth. Conclusions While fee exemptions remove important financial barriers to accessing priority maternal health services, they are insufficient to ensure equal access among wealth groups. </p...|$|E
40|$|Many {{developing}} countries are considering or {{in the process of}} implementing user fees for government health care services. These fees have the benefit of generating much needed revenue and discouraging unnecessary utilization, but have the potential negative effect of excluding low income individuals from necessary medical care. In 1989, the Ministry of Health of the Government of Kenya briefly implemented user fees for government facilities which included a system for waiving fees for low income patients. This paper examines how that system might have worked in theory and how it worked in practice. Survey data from three districts in Kenya are used to estimate the percentage of health center outpatient fees that may need to be waived to avoid undue burden on low income households. The percentage of outpatient <b>fee</b> <b>exemptions</b> range from 11 to 34 % depending on the district and the criterion used to determine ability to pay. This paper then assesses the extent to which ability to pay can be determined by readily obtainable information on patients' socio-economic characteristics. It is shown that these characteristics do predict ability to pay, but not with the degree of accuracy necessary to use as the sole criteria for granting exemptions. Thus, although the evidence from Kenya indicates that the level of outpatient fees could be paid by {{the majority of the population}} without undue burden, a minority would require <b>fee</b> <b>exemptions.</b> The main obstacle to implementing a system of exemptions is the inability to easily identify those unable to pay. user fees cost-sharing ability to pay access to care...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{acknowledged}} gap in {{the literature}} on the impact of <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policies on health staff, and, conversely, the implications of staffing for <b>fee</b> <b>exemption.</b> This article draws from five research tools used to analyse changing health worker policies and incentives in post-war Sierra Leone to document the effects of the Free Health Care Initiative (FHCI) of 2010 on health workers. Data were collected through document review (57 documents fully reviewed, published and grey); key informant interviews (23 with government, donors, NGO staff and consultants); analysis of human resource data held by the MoHS; in-depth interviews with health workers (23 doctors, nurses, mid-wives and community health officers); and a health worker survey (312 participants, including all main cadres). The article traces the HR reforms which were triggered by the FHCI and evidence of their effects, which include substantial increases in number and pay (particularly for higher cadres), as well as a reported reduction in absenteeism and attrition, and an increase (at least for some areas, where data is available) in outputs per health worker. The findings high-light how a flagship policy, combined with high profile support and financial and technical resour-ces, can galvanize systemic changes. In this regard, the story of Sierra Leone differs from man...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} maternity-related fee payment policies on the uptake of skilled birth care amongst the poor in Ghana. Methods: Population data representing 12, 288 births between November 1990 and October 2008 from four consecutive rounds of the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys were {{used to examine the}} impact of four major maternity-related payment policies: the full-cost recovery cash and carry scheme; antenatal care fee exemption; delivery care <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> and the National Health Insurance Scheme. Concentration curves were used to analyse the rich-poor gap in the use of skilled birth care by the four policy interventions. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the effect of the policies on the uptake of skilled birth care, adjusting for relevant predictors and clustering within communities and districts. Findings: The uptake of skilled birth care over the policy periods for the poorest women was trivial when compared to their non-poor counterparts. The rich-poor gap in skilled birth care use was highly pronounced during the ?cash and carry ?and free antenatal care policies period. The benefits during the free delivery care and ?National ?Health Insurance Scheme policy periods accrued more for the rich than the poor. ?There exist significant differences in skilled birth care use between and within communities and districts, even after adjusting for policy effects and other relevant predictors. Conclusion: The maternal care <b>fee</b> <b>exemption</b> policies specifically targeted towards the poorest women had limited impact on the uptake of skilled birth care. <br/...|$|E
