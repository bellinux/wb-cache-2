5|$|Cortinarius violaceus {{mushrooms}} are considered edible, {{but they are}} not choice; instead, the primary appeal of the species to mushroom hunters, according to Arora, is <b>its</b> <b>beauty.</b> Its similarity to some other (inedible or toxic) webcaps renders it risky to eat.

5|$|At night, {{small groups}} of bluespotted ribbontail rays follow the rising tide onto sandy flats to root for small benthic {{invertebrates}} and bony fishes in the sediment. When the tide recedes, the rays separate and withdraw to shelters on the reef. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with females giving birth to litters of up to seven young. This ray is capable of injuring humans with its venomous tail spines, though it prefers to flee if threatened. Because of <b>its</b> <b>beauty</b> and size, the bluespotted ribbontail ray is popular with private aquarists despite being poorly suited to captivity. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as it faces widespread habitat degradation and intensive fishing pressure throughout its range.|$|E
