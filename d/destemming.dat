50|$|BN <b>DeStem</b> is a {{regional}} Dutch newspaper. It {{focuses on the}} Western part of North Brabant and Zeeland, and originated in 1998 through the merger of the Brabants Nieuwsblad (located in Roosendaal) and De Stem (located in Breda). BN <b>DeStem</b> {{is part of the}} Wegener group {{and is a member of}} the GPD news agency. The circulation is 114,479 copies (2009). The editor-in-chief is Johan Uffelen (since 1 May 2001).|$|R
50|$|<b>Destemming</b> is {{the process}} of {{separating}} stems from the grapes. Depending on the winemaking procedure, this process may be undertaken before crushing with the purpose of lowering the development of tannins and vegetal flavors in the resulting wine. Single berry harvesting, as is done with some German Trockenbeerenauslese, avoids this step altogether with the grapes being individually selected.|$|E
50|$|Colombo is {{an outspoken}} {{advocate}} of organic viticultural practices {{as well as}} green harvesting and extended hang-time for more physiological ripeness. He also believes firming in <b>destemming</b> clusters prior to fermentation with the must going through an extended maceration on the skins. Colombo wines are typically aged 12-14 months in large foudres oak barrels that hold up to 120 hectoliters before spending an additional 1-3 years in standard 225-228 liter barriques of neutral oak.|$|E
5000|$|Crushing is {{the process}} when gently {{squeezing}} the berries and breaking the skins to start to liberate {{the contents of the}} berries. <b>Destemming</b> {{is the process}} of removing the grapes from the rachis (the stem which holds the grapes). In traditional and smaller-scale wine making, the harvested grapes are sometimes crushed by trampling them barefoot or by the use of inexpensive small scale crushers. These can also destem at the same time. However, in larger wineries, a mechanical crusher/destemmer is used.The decision about <b>destemming</b> is different for red and white wine making. Generally when making white wine the fruit is only crushed, the stems are then placed in the press with the berries. The presence of stems in the mix facilitates pressing by allowing juice to flow past flattened skins. These accumulate {{at the edge of the}} press.For red winemaking, stems of the grapes are usually removed before fermentation since the stems have a relatively high tannin content; in addition to tannin they can also give the wine a vegetal aroma (due to extraction of 2-methoxy-3-isopropylpyrazine which has an aroma reminiscent of green bell peppers.) On occasion, the winemaker may decide to leave them in if the grapes themselves contain less tannin than desired. This is more acceptable if the stems have 'ripened' and started to turn brown.If increased skin extraction is desired, a winemaker might choose to crush the grapes after <b>destemming.</b> Removal of stems first means no stem tannin can be extracted. In these cases the grapes pass between two rollers which squeeze the grapes enough to separate the skin and pulp, but not so much as to cause excessive shearing or tearing of the skin tissues. In some cases, notably with [...] "delicate" [...] red varietals such as Pinot noir or Syrah, all or part of the grapes might be left uncrushed (called [...] "whole berry") to encourage the retention of fruity aromas through partial carbonic maceration.|$|E

50|$|On {{arrival at}} the winery there is usually a mixture of {{individual}} berries, whole bunches (particularly with hand-picked grapes), stems, and leaves. The presence of stems during fermentation {{can lead to a}} bitter taste in the wine, and the purpose of <b>destemming</b> is to separate grapes from the stems and leaves. Mechanical de-stemmers usually consist of a rotating cage perforated with grape-sized holes. Within this cage is a concentric axle with arms radiating towards the inner surface of the cage. Grapes pass through the holes in the cage, while stems and leaves are expelled through the open end of the cage.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} Benovia’s Pinot noir wines begins with handpicking the fruit during harvest. Workers clip the grapes from the vines in bunches, collect the grape clusters in bins, and transport the fruit to a sorting table. Each cluster is inspected by hand at the sorting table prior to the automated <b>destemming</b> process which separates the berries from the stems. A second sorting area following <b>destemming</b> allows workers to inspect the individual berries and discard unsuitable fruit. The grapes are then transferred to small, open-top fermentors as gently as possible to minimize fruit damage. After a pre-fermentation maceration of five to eight days, the indigenous yeast encourages the longer process of malolactic fermentation. The wines then spend 14 to 16 months aging in French oak barrels before being transferred to the bottling line at Benovia. The winery's Chardonnay grapes follow a similar process. After hand-sorting, the whole clusters are transferred directly to the wine press. Whole cluster pressing helps minimize the amount of malic acid and tannins that naturally exist in the skins, seeds and stems from entering the wine. After settling, the resulting juice (called “must”) is moved to French oak barrels to ferment at a cool temperature for approximately four to six weeks. The barrels are inoculated for malolactic fermentation, and the lees are stirred weekly until the process is complete. This method helps the malolactic fermentation, integrates the new oak, and builds body and structure in the wine.|$|E
5000|$|Most red wines {{derive their}} color from grape skins (the {{exception}} being varieties or hybrids of non-vinifera vines which contain juice pigmented {{with the dark}} Malvidin 3,5-diglucoside anthocyanin) and therefore contact between the juice and skins is essential for color extraction.Red wines are produced by <b>destemming</b> and crushing the grapes into a tank and leaving the skins {{in contact with the}} juice throughout the fermentation (maceration). It is possible to produce white (colorless) wines from red grapes by the fastidious pressing of uncrushed fruit. This minimizes contact between grape juice and skins (as in the making of Blanc de noirs sparkling wine, which is derived from Pinot noir, a red vinifera grape.) ...|$|E

5000|$|Jayer opposed {{extensive}} use of chemicals in vineyards and advocated plowing to control weeds. Jayer believed that low yields were the foundation of truly great wines. Jayer was noted for his refusal to filter his wines and known to always <b>destemming</b> his grapes in contrast to habits of other growers in Burgundy that even today let stems go through the crusher when vintages does not provide enough tannins. This has the side effect of adding tannins with more green and bitter character. Jayer also invented a new technique called cold soak that is a pre-maceration avoiding spontaneous fermentation at temperature of about 10 oC for 1-4 days. The method aims to extract more apples, complex aromas, color, less harsh tannins and add more nose to wines.|$|E
50|$|Most white {{wines are}} {{processed}} without <b>destemming</b> or crushing and are transferred from picking bins {{directly to the}} press. This is to avoid any extraction of tannin from either the skins or grapeseeds, as well as maintaining proper juice flow through a matrix of grape clusters rather than loose berries. In some circumstances winemakers choose to crush white grapes {{for a short period}} of skin contact, usually for three to 24 hours. This serves to extract flavor and tannin from the skins (the tannin being extracted to encourage protein precipitation without excessive Bentonite addition) as well as Potassium ions, which participate in bitartrate precipitation (cream of tartar). It also results in an increase in the pH of the juice which may be desirable for overly acidic grapes. This was a practice more common in the 1970s than today, though still practiced by some Sauvignon blanc and Chardonnay producers in California.|$|E
5000|$|As soon as {{the grapes}} arrive at the winery, they are sorted and destemmed. After <b>destemming,</b> the grapes are then delicately pressed, just to break the skins, and this must be {{immediately}} transferred to temperature-controlled, stainless-steel vats that hold between 1,585 and 3,170 gallons. These specialized vats are divided into two separate tanks stacked {{on top of one}} another. The top tank is the first stop for the grapes - they are chilled down to [...] for a two-day cold soak, and natural fermentation begins gently, as the temperatures rise after the cold soak. The gradual increase in temperature results in more complex flavors in the finished wine. This top tank is also equipped with pistons to gently punch down the cap from above. Once enough color and flavor have been extracted, the juice is separated from the must, by gravity, and goes to the bottom tank to finish fermentation.|$|E

This work focused on the study of the effects of a electroporation treatment (0. 5 kV/cm, 5 ms, 0, 56 kJ/kg) over grapes after <b>destemming</b> and crushing to increase the extraction of phenolic compounds during vinification process until obtaining the final wine. The results point to an higher permeability of the plasmic membrane of the grapes caused by the treatment, which influences the release kinetics of existing phenolic compounds in grapes during maceration and its contents on the final wine. Thus, from the electroporation treatment were recorded, on the final wine, significant increases in colour intensity, in concentration of anthocyanins, in concentration of coloured anthocyanins, in polymeric pigments and in the tanning power.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Although sensory {{description}} of wines in scientific literature is very large, {{there is an}} evident lack of studies describing wines from a dynamic approach. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe the evolution of the sensations perceived in red wines from Rioja Alavesa by using Temporal Dominance of Sensations (TDS) and also to compare wines made with the two winemaking procedures used in Rioja Alavesa: carbonic maceration (CM) and <b>destemming</b> (DS). RESULTS: Ten sensory attributes were evaluated in eight wines (four CM and four DS wines) in triplicate by a panel of 16 trained assessors. Red/black berry and woody aromas were dominant firstly, whereas heat, astringent, bitter and pungent sensations were dominant later. CM wines showed higher dominance for woody, spicy, pungent and acid sensations and lower dominance for red/black berry aroma and astringency than DS wines. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to describe Rioja wines from a dynamic approach and it also provides information about the dynamic sensory differences between wines made by CM or by DS. In this sense, this work shows the usefulness of TDS to describe and differentiate wines and to provide additional information to the conventional static descriptive analysis.
