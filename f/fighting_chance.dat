Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation.

Brock also began seeking out First Nations leaders, such as the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, to build alliances with him against the Americans in the event of war. Although the conventional wisdom of the day was that Canada would fall quickly {{in the event of an}} invasion, Brock pursued these strategies to give the colony a <b>fighting</b> <b>chance.</b>|$|E

5|$|As a child, Morrissey {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in film, television and Gene Kelly musicals. After seeing a broadcast of Kes on television, {{he decided to}} become an actor. At his primary school, St Margaret Mary's School, he was encouraged by a teacher named Miss Keller, who cast him as the Scarecrow in a school production adapted from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz when he was 11 years old. Keller left the school soon after, leaving Morrissey without encouragement. His secondary school, De La Salle School, had no drama classes and {{was the sort of}} place where Morrissey thought the fear of bullying dissuaded pupils from participating in lessons. On the advice of a cousin, Morrissey joined the Everyman Youth Theatre. For the first couple of weeks, he was quite shy and did not join in the workshops. When he eventually participated, he appeared in the youth theatre's production of <b>Fighting</b> <b>Chance,</b> a play about the riots in Liverpool. He went to the theatre on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{conditions}} were deteriorating on Königsberg. There were shortages of coal, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Although {{safe from the}} British, the crew was ravaged by malaria and other tropical ailments. Generally {{cut off from the}} outside world, the morale of the sailors fell. However, the situation was marginally improved with a scheme to resupply the ship and give her a <b>fighting</b> <b>chance</b> to return home. A captured British merchant ship, Rubens, was renamed Kronborg. It was given a Danish flag, papers, and a crew of German sailors selected for their ability to speak Danish. It was then packed with coal, field guns, ammunition, small arms, and various supplies. As the freighter approached East Africa, Königsberg prepared to sortie to meet the ship and attempt to break out and return to Germany. Instead, Königsberg was trapped in the river by two cruisers and several smaller vessels. Hyacinth intercepted Kronborg as she approached, and chased her to Manza Bay. The trapped ship was forced aground and set on fire, but the Germans salvaged much of her cargo and put it to use later in the East Africa Campaign.|$|E

They help Scotty (voiced by Simon Pegg) and Keenser reactivate the warp core, and restore power to sickbay so McCoy can replicate more of the antidote for airborne dispersal. The duo head to the bridge where the Henchman is holding Uhura (voiced by Zoe Saldana) hostage, demanding Kirk give them control of the ship. Kirk responds by directing their shuttle to crash into the view-screen, decompressing the Gorn into space. With only an hour before the Rip closes, Kirk and Spock space dive to the Gorn Commander's ship, where they disable the targeting platform to give Enterprise a <b>fighting</b> <b>chance,</b> and enter the core where T'Mar and the device are being held. Kirk and Spock destroy the device, defeat the Commander, and are beamed back to Enterprise with T'Mar. Enterprise warps back to the Milky Way Galaxy before the Rip closes; in their closing logs, Kirk and Spock state T'Mar has recovered enough to continue working on New Vulcan, and that they have been ordered to Nibiru.|$|E

500|$|Macaulay's bowling {{action was}} relaxed and effortless, being admired by his contemporaries. Kilburn wrote: [...] "His run-up was half-shambling, his steps short and his {{shoulders}} swaying, but {{his feet were}} faultlessly placed and his aim was high at the instant of delivery". However, critics and team-mates more widely knew him as passionate, hostile and fiery when bowling. Kilburn said that batsmen were Macaulay's [...] "mortal enemies". He knew many tricks to dismiss or unsettle them, including the tactic of bowling the ball straight at their head without pitching, which was usually considered dangerous and unfair. Kilburn observed that [...] "should the batsman survive he would be rewarded with a glare of concentrated venom calculated to stagger any but the stoutest heart... Every scrap of his heart and soul went into every ball he bowled. He never gave up and his persistence was invariably triumphant sooner or later". The Yorkshire Post, after his death, observed: [...] "Macaulay will always be remembered for the fierceness of his enthusiasm {{when there was a}} <b>fighting</b> <b>chance</b> of victory".|$|E

5000|$|The {{sociology}} of gender {{is an important}} theme in Cherryh's writing, but perhaps more subtly so than in that of some other female authors such as Marion Zimmer Bradley or Jean M. Auel. For example, {{over the course of}} her first series (the Morgaine cycle), a subordinate warrior, Nhi Vanye, gradually achieves equal status and responsibility with his liege lady Morgaine Angharan. In her most overtly feminist series, the Chanur novels, Cherryh addresses gender equality in two subplots: first, a male human, Tully, struggles to achieve respect within the strongly matriarchal hani society, a society in which men are assumed to be irrational and violent; and second, a male hani, Khym Mahn, inspires men's liberation when he becomes the first male starship crew member of his species. Cherryh continues this theme through the last novel in the series, in which a young male hani follows Mahn's example rather than taking his <b>chances</b> <b>fighting</b> other males in the [...] "outback".|$|R
500|$|Achtung Baby {{received}} acclaim from critics. Elysa Gardner of Rolling Stone said U2 had [...] "proven {{that the}} same penchant for epic musical and verbal gestures that leads many artists to self-parody can, in more inspired hands, fuel the unforgettable fire that defines great rock & roll." [...] The review said that the album, like its predecessor Rattle and Hum, was {{an attempt by the}} band to [...] "broaden its musical palette, but this time its ambitions are realized". Bill Wyman from Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "pristinely produced and surprisingly unpretentious return by one of the most impressive bands in the world". Steve Morse of The Boston Globe echoed these sentiments, stating that the album [...] "not only reinvigorates their sound, but drops any self-righteousness. The songs focus on personal relationships, not on saving the world." [...] Morse commended the album's [...] "clanging, knob-twisting sound effects" [...] and the Edge's [...] "metallic, head-snapping guitar". In the Los Angeles Times, Robert Hilburn stated, [...] "the arty, guitar-driven textures are among the band's most confident and vigorous ever". He said the album is a difficult one for listeners because of the dark, introspective nature of the songs, which contrasts with the group's uplifting songs of the past. Jon Pareles of The New York Times lauded the record not only for featuring [...] "noisy, vertiginous arrangements", but also for the group's ability to [...] "maintain its pop skills". The review concluded, [...] "Stripped-down and defying its old formulas, U2 has given itself a <b>fighting</b> <b>chance</b> for the 1990s." ...|$|E
500|$|When Swift {{was first}} signed to Big Machine Records, {{it was a}} new and {{extremely}} small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an [...] "uphill climb" [...] and said, [...] "There was this moment where I sat there and was like, ‘When {{are we going to get}} a <b>fighting</b> <b>chance?</b> We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" [...] After reassuring to herself that it would be different in the future, she wrote the beginning of [...] "Change". She let the track sit for a while, waiting for a remarkable event to trigger its completion. She then completed the track the day after she won the Horizon Award at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards and saw Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine Records, crying. [...] "That’s when I finished , because I knew I couldn’t finish it until something like that happened.

In this way, and by selling pardons at a dear rate and by varieties of avarice and oppression, he scraped together a large treasure. He then appointed two Bishops {{to take care of his}} kingdom in his absence, and gave great powers and possessions to his brother John, to secure his friendship.
