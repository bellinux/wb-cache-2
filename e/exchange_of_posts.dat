40|$|A travers l’analyse des {{interactions}} entre hommes politiques et internautes sur Facebook après les élections présidentielles de 2007 en France, cet article vise à montrer comment les réseaux sociaux sont exploités par les deux parties. Au départ un réseau décentralisé qui lie les gens sans intervention politico-hiérarchique, Facebook est mobilisé par {{les hommes}} politiques au service de leur besoins. Quelles en sont les conséquences pour la sphère publique : s’agit-il d’un outil qui permet à l’internaute de déjouer les usages de marketing politique qu’en fait l’homme politique ? The {{purpose of this}} article is to show how social networks, and more specifically Facebook, are used by politicians and their supporters. This is achieved through a detailed analysis of <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> between politicians and surfers in the period following the presidential election campaigns in France of 2007. It is shown how politicians take advantage of Facebook, despite its initially being a decentralized social network, connecting people without a political or hierarchic purpose. The article attempts to show some of the consequences of such an exploitation of a public network for the public sphere and asks how much leverage there is for the surfers/citizens in moderating political marketing on Facebook...|$|E

Avoiding a civil war, the revolutionaries agreed to Yuan's plan of the unified China under Yuan's government. On March 8, 1912 the Provisional Senate passed the Provisional Constitution to limit Yuan's power in the future. On March 10, the Senate elected Yuan as the second Provisional President of the Republic. The power of the Nanking Government and the Provisional Senate hence transitioned to the Beiyang Government in Peking, which signified {{the dissolution of the}} Provisional Government.

50|$|The demonetization of postage {{and revenue}} stamps {{is the process}} by which the stamps are {{rendered}} no longer valid. In general, stamp demonetization is a rare event, since any unused stamp is effectively equivalent to its face value, and there is no financial disadvantage if postal customers use old stamps on their mail. Demonetization chiefly occurs in connection with major upheavals in the postal system, such as a transfer from one country to another, or currency changes, such as decimalisation, or a change of government. The process <b>of</b> <b>exchanging</b> millions or billions of stamps in the public's hands, plus that <b>of</b> <b>exchanging</b> <b>post</b> office stock, is usually complicated and difficult, and offers much interest for students of postal history.|$|R
40|$|Since most {{conventional}} {{classroom learning}} in which English is a Foreign Language (EFL) is still characterized by learners‟ traditional roles and lacks such dynamic collaboration and interaction, EFL learners are increasingly using Social Network Sites (SNSs) as online Communities of Practice (CoPs) in adopting collaborative learning and transforming the EFL pedagogical approach {{as a new}} strategy towards achieving success in the modern digital age. Based on the theoretical background of CoPs, the current study aims to investigate the application of SNSs as a CoP in providing EFL students {{with the opportunity to}} use English, and to improve their learning through collaborative interaction in the language. The subjects of this study were 24 active and regular members of the Only for English Learning Facebook (FB) Community– a group developed and maintained by the researchers – for EFL learners coming from different countries. As to gain further information and understanding from the participants of how such EFL learning practice could be improved, online questionnaire, semi-structure interview and commentary <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> interaction <b>posts</b> were used for data collection and analysis. The findings proved that such online CoPwas perceived as an effective learning environment conducive to promoting the EFL learners‟ writing, grammar, reading andpersonal and socio- cultural skills and domains. Their perception of this CoP significantly increased during the period of collaborative learning...|$|R

He {{went on to become the}} MP for Ayr at the 1710 General election, and became one of the Gentleman of the bedchamber to George II, when Prince of Wales. John Montgomerie seems to have been totally uninterested in the affairs of the mint and his personal finances were in some disarray. He at one point proposed an <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> his <b>post</b> at the mint for a commission in the Foot Guards and ended up with both. He fought in the war against France and was at the disastrous battle of Almanza in Spain. In June 1717 he assigned his salary to a third party, having withdrawn from any active involvement. In 1727 he was appointed as Governor of New York, where he remained until his death on 1 July 1731. He had a daughter Elizabeth, and upon his death the line of the Montgomerie of Giffen became extinct. He had been forced to sell his estates and it was Sir John Anstruther of the Balcaskie family, who purchased Giffen in 1722, under the burden of liferent as Francis was still living. As Fullarton puts it the large and valuable estate of Giffen, is now broken down into a multitude of inglorious fragments, with scarcely a possibility of its ever again being restored and cemented into its original dignity and beneficial condition.|$|R

40|$|What are {{economic}} exchanges? The received {{view has}} it that exchanges are mutual transfers of goods motivated by inverse valuations thereof. As a corollary, the standard approach treats <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> services as a subspecies <b>of</b> <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> goods. We raise two objections against this standard approach. First, it is incomplete, as it fails to take into account, among other things, the offers and acceptances that lie {{at the core of}} even the simplest cases <b>of</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Second, it ultimately fails to generalize to <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> services, in which neither inverse preferences nor mutual transfers hold true. We propose an alternative definition <b>of</b> <b>exchanges,</b> which treats <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> goods as a special case <b>of</b> <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> services and which builds in offers and acceptances. According to this theory: (i) The valuations motivating exchanges are propositional and convergent rather than objectual and inverse; (ii) All <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> goods involve <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> services/actions, but not the reverse; (iii) Offers and acceptances, together with the contractual obligations and claims they bring about, {{lie at the heart of}} all cases <b>of</b> <b>exchange...</b>|$|R
