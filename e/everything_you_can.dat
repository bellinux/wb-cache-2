You have the fastest rhythms, the more danceable ones, you have <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> expect from an Anthrax record."

500|$|In May 2000, Aronofsky {{was briefly}} {{attached}} {{to make an}} adaptation of David Wiesner's 1999 children's book Sector 7 for Nickelodeon Movies, the project remains unmade. In mid-2000, Warner Bros. hired Aronofsky to write and direct Batman: Year One, {{which was to be}} the fifth film in the Batman franchise. Aronofsky, who collaborated with Frank Miller on an unproduced script for Ronin, brought Miller to co-write Year One with him, intending to reboot the series. [...] "It's somewhat based on the comic book", Aronofsky later said. [...] "Toss out <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> imagine about Batman! Everything! We're starting completely anew". Regular Aronofsky collaborator Matthew Libatique was set as cinematographer, and Aronofsky had also approached Christian Bale for the role of Batman. Bale later would be cast in the role for Batman Begins. After that project failed to develop, Aronofsky declined the opportunity to direct an entry in the Batman franchise.|$|E

500|$|The New Yorker Anthony Lane {{criticized the}} plot, saying [...] "toss <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find, {{starting}} with roughly diced plots, into the blender: such {{appears to be}} the method behind Tower Heist." [...] Lane called the characters [...] "unlikable people" [...] but offered praise to Broderick, saying he [...] "underplays [...] so well." [...] Lane lamented that [...] "the notion of a theft from the thieves from those who are lapped in lofty, screw-you wealth is a tempting one right now, but Tower Heist passes the buck." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge was also critical, saying the film [...] "goes wonky {{on the way to the}} bank, due to its lackluster pacing and shortage of the qualities that typically earn stars Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy their paychecks – namely, laughs." [...] Debruge felt that the opening 40 minutes were [...] "a dull blue-collar drama populated entirely by stereotypes," [...] and while the film [...] "picks up some much-needed momentum" [...] with the actual heist, the [...] "resolution feels rushed." [...] However, Debruge echoed praise for Murphy, calling his performance [...] "a welcome return to the comic's irreverent, '80s-era persona," [...] and lamenting his limited screen-time.|$|E
500|$|By September 2000 Warner Bros. was {{developing}} a live action screen adaptation of Batman Beyond, written by Paul Dini, Neal Stephenson and Boaz Yakin, {{with the possibility}} of Yakin directing, as well as an adaptation of Frank Miller's 1987 comic book story arc [...] Despite interest from Schumacher, Darren Aronofsky was hired to direct and co-write with Miller, whom he previously collaborated with on an unproduced script for Ronin. Yakin developed one draft of the Batman Beyond screenplay with the writers but soon lost interest, and Warner Bros. abandoned Batman Beyond almost instantly in favor of Batman: Year One. Aronofsky and Miller intended to reboot the Batman franchise, [...] "it's somewhat based on the comic book," [...] Aronofsky said. [...] "Toss out <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> imagine about Batman! Everything! We're starting completely anew." [...] Regular Aronofsky collaborator, Matthew Libatique, was set as cinematographer, and Christian Bale had been approached for the role of Batman. Coincidentally, Bale would be cast in the role for Batman Begins. At the same time, Warner Bros. was moving forward on a Catwoman spin-off. Around 2001, Warner commissioned the rewriting of the film's script to The Matrix directors The Wachowskis, but The Wachowskis' script didn't convince Warner. Joss Whedon was later hired to rewrite the script, but like happened with The Wachowskis' script, Warner didn't like his script- In June 2002, the studio decided to move forward on Batman vs. Superman and abandon Year One.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the CD-ROM based Saturn port, EGM {{commented that}} the {{graphics}} are identical to the arcade version but that there are missing sound effects and [...] "unbearable" [...] slowdown when first performing a special move. They rated it the best home version of the game to date but felt that with Mortal Kombat II having considerably aged by this point, any port needed to be near arcade perfect to stand out. Next Generation felt that the Saturn version was arcade perfect, but that the Mortal Kombat series {{as a whole was}} grossly overrated and lacked any gameplay innovations to make it stand out from other fighting games. They summarized that [...] "if you are a fan of the game (and you know who you are), then the Saturn version is <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hope for - an arcade-perfect translation - and yet, there is nothing outside of a flashy presentation and a little gore to recommend this game over a million others just like it." [...] Scary Larry of GamePro agreed that the Saturn port [...] "duplicates the arcade version perfectly", but argued that the slowdown and load times make the game frustrating to play. He concluded that the conversion would make a decent holdover until Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 hit the Saturn, but fails to measure up to Mortal Kombat 3 on the PlayStation. Sega Saturn Magazine was extremely disappointed with {{the final version of the}} Saturn port, calling it [...] "much worse than any of the versions seen on the cartridge format," [...] as opposed to the vastly superior pre-release version they had reviewed five months earlier.|$|E

2500|$|During his 10 {{years in}} Buffalo, Zelen helped the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) — {{one of several}} {{regional}} organizations established by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to test experimental cancer treatments — with its studies. In an American University alumni magazine article in 2008, Zelen said those early studies were “terrible.” He said the studies were “poorly thought out; the data was wrong; they had poor quality control, not enough patients — <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> think of that was antiscientific.” [...] He urged biomedical researchers {{in charge of the}} studies to begin from scratch because they had learned relatively little because of study design flaws. They agreed with Zelen, and along with his longtime collaborator Paul Carbone, he established research standards and practice now used in clinical trials for many infectious diseases. [...] During that period, Zelen formed the Statistical Laboratory at the University of Buffalo, which focused on overseeing and improving statistical aspects of large, complex drug trials. [...] ECOG would later become one of the world's largest programs for testing and evaluating various cancer treatments.|$|E
