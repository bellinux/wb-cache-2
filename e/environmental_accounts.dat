40|$|Abstract: The {{implementation}} of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> in a Natural Reserve produced some significant results {{in terms of}} restrictions. First of all, <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> introduced a limitation in scale, which was inapplicable on a micro scale. A second restriction concerned the physical unit measure that was used instead of a monetary unit measure. Finally, a third limitation {{was related to the}} fact that <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> only takes costs into <b>account,</b> and not <b>environmental</b> benefits. These three limitations led us to develop an <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> model that considered both consumed and produced resources in the Natural Reserve. The model aimed at supplementing monetary accounting (based on cost and revenue) with <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting,</b> which not only reflects environmental cost, but also environmental revenue; i. e. environmental benefit.

5000|$|This {{method of}} accounting, which makes {{adjustments}} to the existing national account indicators, found traction in the System of Integrated Economic and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Accounts</b> (SEEA), published by the United Nations as an appendix to the 1993 SNA. The report offered five approaches, or versions, to developing <b>environmental</b> <b>accounts.</b> Over the years, the SEEA has been expanded and revised {{in view of the}} increased sophistication of accounting methodologies and technology. This revision will be explored in greater detail in the [...] "Global Initiatives" [...] section. Ultimately, the importance of the SEEA with respect to the green GDP is {{that it is possible to}} create full-sequence accounts from which aggregates such as green GDP can be derived and compared internationally, and many countries have begun this process.|$|E
50|$|The UK {{produces}} <b>Environmental</b> <b>Accounts,</b> {{consistent with}} the SEEA framework, that are separated into three dimensions: natural resource accounts, physical flows and monetary accounts. The majority of the data is measured in physical units; monetary units are used where relevant, and if the necessary data is available.|$|E
50|$|Many {{countries}} are undertaking projects to develop <b>environmental</b> <b>accounts,</b> to integrate them with national accounts or to create environmentally-adjusted macroeconomic indicators, including Green GDP. Early adopters of integrated environmental-economic accounts include the Netherlands, France, and the Philippines.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the extent to which Portuguese local {{entities}} have implemented a set of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices, and to analyse some potential determining factors of their use. Design/methodology/approach – The data were collected by sending a postal questionnaire to a sample of medium-sized and large city councils and the municipal companies belonging to those municipalities. Three variables were considered as possible factors that drive the development of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices in the local public sector. Findings – The degree of development of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices in Portuguese local entities is low. Organisational size and the degree of development of environmental management practices are positively and statistically related to the level of development of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices. However, the findings suggest that the existence of compulsory <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> standards is not positively associated with the development of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices by Portuguese local entities. Research limitations/implications – The study limits itself to Portugal and, therefore, its results could not be applicable in other settings. Practical implications – Portugal is experiencing a phase of development of regulatory environmental disclosure requirements. Understanding the <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> and reporting practices currently developed by Portuguese local entities, as well as their drivers, may help regulators to develop more suitable standards for the sector. Originality/value – The majority of empirical studies on <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices in public organisations are focused largely on an Anglo-Saxon context. This paper attempts to address this gap in the literature by providing a snapshot of the <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices developed by Portuguese local entities. <b>Accounting,</b> <b>Environmental</b> management, Local government, Portugal...|$|R
