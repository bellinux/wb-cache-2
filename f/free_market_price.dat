25|$|This {{agreement}} did {{not affect}} the independent global or regional markets in which gold was traded as a precious metal commodity. There was still an open gold market. For the Bretton Woods system to remain effective, the fix of the dollar to gold would have to be adjustable, or the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> <b>price</b> of gold would have to be maintained near the $35 official foreign exchange price.

The Kennedy administration drafted a radical change of the tax system to spur more production capacity and thus encourage exports.

25|$|The {{government}} undertook several {{reforms to}} stem excess liquidity, increase labor incentives and alleviate serious shortages of food, consumer goods and services. To alleviate the economic crisis, the government introduced a few market-oriented reforms including opening to tourism, allowing foreign investment, legalizing the U.S. dollar and authorizing self-employment for some 150 occupations. (This policy was later partially reversed, so {{that while the}} U.S. dollar is no longer accepted in businesses, it remains legal for Cubans to hold the currency.) These measures resulted in modest economic growth.

25|$|The {{design of}} the Bretton Woods System was that nations could only enforce gold {{convertibility}} on the anchor currency—the United States' dollar. Gold convertibility enforcement was not required, but instead, allowed. Nations could forgo converting dollars to gold, and instead hold dollars. Rather than full convertibility, it provided a fixed price for sales between central banks. However, there was still an open gold market.

25|$|In March 1968, {{the effort}} to control the private market price of gold was abandoned. A two-tier system began. In this system all central-bank {{transactions}} in gold were insulated from the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> <b>price.</b> Central banks would trade gold among themselves at $35 per troy ounce (112.53 ¢/g) but would not trade with the private market. The private market could trade at the equilibrium market price {{and there would be}} no official intervention. The price immediately jumped to $43 per troy ounce (138.25 ¢/g). The price of gold touched briefly back at $35 (112.53 ¢/g) near the end of 1969 before beginning a steady price increase. This gold price increase turned steep through 1972 and hit a high that year of over $70 (2.25 $/g). By that time floating exchange rates had also begun to emerge, which indicated the de facto dissolution of the Bretton Woods system. The two-tier system was abandoned in November 1973. By then the price of gold had reached $100 per troy ounce (3.22 $/g).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{develop a}} model of trade with {{endogeneity}} in key features of industry structure linked to heterogeneous cost structures under Cournot competition. As such we address firm heterogeneity in international trade in a setting with strategic interaction between firms as opposed to existing models where firms are atomistic. Entry/exit dynamics are therefore more complex but also richer. The equilibrium value of the main variables like <b>market</b> <b>price</b> and total sales wander around as firms enter and exit. The model nests two workhorse trade models, the Brander & Krugman reciprocal dumping model and the Ricardian technology-based trade model, as special cases. We examine both free entry and limited entry (free exit) cases. The model generates testable predictions on the probability of zero trade flows and the pattern of export prices and generates endogenous moves from zero to non-zero trade flows due to entry and exit. As two countries move from autarky to <b>free</b> trade, <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> fall, but along the path from autarky to <b>free</b> trade, <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> might increase at certain points. Also with lower trade costs the least productive firms get squeezed out of the market, exporting firms gain market share, and more firms become trade oriented...|$|R

The results show that there is clear evidence of volatility persistence between precious metals returns. In terms of volatility spillovers effects, the main findings are that there is evidence of volatility spillovers running in a bidirectional way in almost all the cases, with the exception of gold, that tend to generate effects in all the markets, but with little evidence {{in the case of the}} other precious metals influencing the gold market.

40|$|In {{the light}} of {{persistently}} low prices for allowances, there is much debate about reforming the EU emissions trading system. Based on a proposal of the European Commission, the EU plans to introduce the so called Market Stability Reserve in 2019 : a mechanism that regulates the amount of allowances within the market by temporarily taking some of the allowances into a reserve. The Commission thereby aims at reducing the surplus and securing a higher <b>market</b> <b>price</b> for allowances. An alternative reform proposal is {{the introduction of a}} minimum price. This RWI position puts forward a third alternative: retaining the emissions trading system in its original form and reducing the surplus by a one-time adjustment. In 2014, 900 million allowances from the years 2014 to 2016 were back-loaded to be auctioned in the years 2019 and 2020. Instead, these allowances should be deleted. Furthermore, if necessary, the amount of allowances could be constantly decreased by reducing the cap more strongly than planned. Compared with the other reform options, retaining the emissions trading system in its original form has two major advantages: first, politically driven interventions are minimized and, second, <b>free</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> exhibit a stabilizing effect for fluctuations caused by the business cycle...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{develop a}} model with {{endogeneity}} in key features of industry structure linked to cross-firm variations in costs under Cournot competition. In {{contrast to the}} literature with cost heterogeneity and atomistic firms, our approach allows us to explore firm heterogeneity in international trade in a setting with strategic interaction between potentially large firms. Entry/exit dynamics are therefore more complex but also richer. The market exhibits churn in key variables, meaning variables like <b>market</b> <b>price</b> and total sales vary over time as firms enter and exit. We also offer a solution for the integer problem inherent in small group models, based on stochastic dominance. We examine both free entry and limited entry (free exit) cases. The model generates testable predictions on the probability of zero trade flows and the pattern of export prices and is consistent with endogenous moves between zero and non-zero trade flows due to entry and exit. In a two country setting, moving from autarky to <b>free</b> trade means <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> fall, though along the path from autarky to <b>free</b> trade <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> might increase at certain points.
