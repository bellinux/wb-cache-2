30|$|Prof. Sharifian: Of {{course it}} does! In recent decades we have {{witnessed}} significant geographical, demographic, and structural changes to the English language, and this requires us to revisit notions such as ‘language proficiency’.

Some scholars, including James Dean Brown, have recently written on this topic, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of actual language testing, {{we have a long way}} to go. Whenever we raise an issue about testing, some people raise concerns such as ‘ease of administration’.

[...] Tobin Bell, the actor who plays Jigsaw, describes his character's role as being more of a scientist or engineer and [...] "he thinks very specifically and very pragmatically". About Jigsaw's games being detail-oriented, Bell said: [...] "My sense is that Jigsaw is so detail oriented that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he <b>thinks</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of worst case scenario. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he's a very good judge of character, so his sense that, for example, that Detective Matthews {{was going to play}} right into his trap, which he did, was right on.

Speaking about playing the character, Bell stated that [...] "you have to think of someone like Jigsaw from a very specific point of view. He doesn't view himself as some kind of diabolical psychotic. You know there's a little bit of evil in everyone. It just gets carried further.

40|$|The {{premise of}} my {{investigation}} {{is that a}} perceptual break takes place between driving along the highway, experiencing the landscape at high speed and then stopping to experience the highway outside the enclosure and protection of the vehicle. Landscape exists {{in a state of}} flux defined and augmented by changing relationships between nature, technology and perceptions of place in the universe. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of landscape imagery — particularly the picturesque — when I view natural environments. The roadside environment was selected as the site for this investigation because of its metaphorical capacity to represent a perceptual break in experiencing the environment. As a space it is littered with animal carcasses and roadside detritus, which when passed at close range during highway travel is easily overlooked. In this project I interrupt drives to look at what animal has fallen victim to traffic. In doing so I experience different perspectives on car travel and the roadside environment as well as temporarily providing a remedy for the apathy that the modern car interior induces. In recognising, dissecting and exploring the various tropes of landscape painting, I have attempted to interrogate the way cultural conventions shape our capacity to see and imagine the environment. By choosing the roadside as the place for this break, I provide a catalyst for revitalising the way that I see and think about the natural world and introduce my own comment on the language of landscape. The idea of a break in perception is explored in three parts in the exegesis which establishes a narrative from which the central ideas can be explored. These are: the specific links between car travel and picturesque landscape imagery; the break in perception and the many objects discovered on the roadside through reference to Vanitas (a reminder of the transience of life and the certainty of death encouraging a somber world view) and the allegorical possibilities that the roadside elements might hold for a personal visual language; and the alienating character of many roadside spaces lending itself to Surreal readings and illusionism. The work consists of a tripartite exploration using drawing, pinhole photography and the integration of these media to inform the paintings that represent the visual outcome of the investigation...|$|E
40|$|I am {{not going}} to talk about the past history of bird {{problems}} and the aviation industry; we 2 ̆ 7 re pretty well aware of what has happened. It was in 1960 that the U. S. really got some awareness because of the crash at Boston 2 ̆ 7 s Logan Airport. Following that was the first Fish and Wildlife Service involvement in bird problems at airports. For a number of years thereafter, the Fish and Wildlife Service Center at Laurel, Maryland had at least one staff biologist working with the FAA and specific airports to try and resolve their problems. Following the 1975 Canada incident with a DC- 10 and gulls, the FAA came to the Service and said, 2 ̆ 2 Don 2 ̆ 7 t you think it is about time that we formalize the arrangement we had for your providing assistance upon request? 2 ̆ 2 This was culminated by the signing of an agreement. It was a very simple, two-page brief, which says that the Service will provide assistance to the FAA upon request. That means that we are not going to go out and solicit work. There has been a lot of discussion within the Fish and Wildlife Service itself. The question that is always raised by our field people is, 2 ̆ 2 What happens if I am driving by this airport and I see 350 seagulls sitting at the end of the runway, and I do not go in and say something to the area manager? Am I liable? 2 ̆ 2 I do not know whether he is liable, but he sure is derelict in his duty if he does not go in there and tell the airport manager that he has a problem. Most of them go out and say, 2 ̆ 2 Hey, that is not my problem. 2 ̆ 2 OK, there is another way. Get hold of the FAA regional office and tell them of the situation. Hopefully, they will suggest to the airport and the airport management that something be done. People ask how big a problem this is. Let us talk about airports in the U. S. There are 14, 000 airports in the U. S. Of this approximately 900 are certified airports; that means they have an air carrier section. The rest of them are general aviation airports, and I am not counting the military airports here. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of financial loss to birds and other vertebrate pest problems: in the U. S., at the very minimum, 20, 000, 000 annually. I suspect it is closer to one hundred million dollars, if the truth be known. Why is not the truth known? We have already discussed that.

40|$|I {{would like}} to thank the {{organizers}} for inviting me to deliver some remarks this morning. By way of background, I am not a historian or genocide scholar, but a law professor with an interest in comparative law and religion. Comparative law and religion is a relatively new field. It explores how different legal regimes reflect, and influence, the relationships that religious communities have with the state and with each other. My recent work compares Islamic and Christian conceptions of law, a subject that has engaged Muslims and Christians since their first encounters in the seventh century. When I approach the Armenian Genocide as a scholar, then, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of Ottoman law and the status of religious communities in that law. These topics may not seem directly relevant at first, but they are. Changes in the legal status of Ottoman Christians—including, of course, Armenians—in the nineteenth century had a significant impact on the events of 1915. The seeds of the Genocide were sown a generation earlier, in the Hamidian massacres of the 1890 s, in which hundreds of thousands of Armenians died. And the Hamidian massacres themselves were influenced by dramatic changes in the classical Islamic legal system that had existed in the Ottoman Empire for centuries. The Tanzimat, or 2 ̆ 2 reorganization, 2 ̆ 2 granted legal equality, in theory, for the first time to the Empire 2 ̆ 7 s Christian subjects. Legal equality, even in theory, subverted the classical Islamic hierarchy and shocked Muslim opinion. In classical jurisprudence, Christians had been dhimmis (in Turkish, zimmis), parties to a notional contract, known as the dhimma, which granted them protection in exchange for a promise to accept subordination. For Armenians to seek, or even accept, legal equality was to repudiate the dhimma. This repudiation caused deep resentment among Ottoman Muslims—so deep, in fact, that the Tanzimat reforms were never fully implemented. The Tanizmat 2 ̆ 7 s failure, and, in particular, the bitterness created by Armenians 2 ̆ 7 attempt to assert equality, forms a significant part of the background of the Hamidian massacres and, ultimately, the Genocide itself. I am dealing with emotional subjects this morning, and some clarifications may be necessary. First, I am not arguing that efforts at legal reform caused the Armenian Genocide. Like all major historical events, the Genocide resulted from many factors—cultural, economic, military, political, and religious. If one is to understand genocidal conflict, though, one must appreciate the history of the relationship between perpetrator and victim, and the Tanzimat—in fact, the classical Ottoman legal system itself—is an important part of the history that Turks and Armenians shared. Second, I am not suggesting that Armenians and other Christians brought their troubles on themselves by seeking equality. That would be to blame the victims. Unless one believes that minorities must accept whatever oppressive treatment the majority metes out, Armenians and other Christians had a right to seek justice in Ottoman society. Third, I understand that the classical Sunni paradigm does not constitute the whole of Islam. Some contemporary Muslim thinkers critique the centrality of law in the classical model, which exists, with the possible exception of Saudi Arabia, nowhere today. I do not mean to suggest that classical Islam represents the religion 2 ̆ 7 s only expression or its 2 ̆ 2 true 2 ̆ 2 essence. I simply describe what that model was, in the context of the Ottoman Empire, and in doing so I rely on a standard account. Finally, in short remarks like these, I must leave out many details. Even in outline, though, an understanding of the Tanzimat, and the classical Islamic legal regime it tried to replace, can illuminate the crisis that Ottoman Armenians endured at the start of the twentieth century...|$|E

Finally, in order to illustrate the interpretation of some of the criteria of just war, and to show how these develop upon encounter with particular circumstances, I consider three topical cases: Britain’s belligerency against Germany in 1914, the Syrian rebellion against the Assad regime in 2011, and Israel’s Operation Protective Edge against Hamas in Gaza in 2014...|$|R
40|$|Diversifying crops {{for food}} and trade Suggested introduction: Across the Caribbean {{it is clear that}} {{agriculture}} needs to diversify. The loss of preferences in EU markets, for example, threatens the economic viability of traditional export crops such as sugar and bananas, and if farmers are to survive they will need to change what they grow, and how they grow it. So what are the options? One basic question is whether countries that traditionally import most of their food should be looking to increase the amount and variety of food crops grown on their own soil. Or should they simply grow other cash crops with strong export potential and sell these to fund continuing food imports? It?s a question that came under discussion at a recent conference focussing on food and nutrition security held in Belize. Susanna Thorp spoke to several participants about their vision of the future of agricultural diversity and trade, and how these link to the nutrition and food security of Caribbean people. In this report she begins by asking extension agent and agronomist, Richard Allport, about the situation regarding food, nutrition and trade, in his home country of Dominica. IN:		?Generally Dominica has always been considered [...] ? OUT:		? themselves as well as trade internationally. ? DUR?N		 8 ? 58 ? Back announcement: Sandra Plummer of the FAO ending that report on the links between crop diversification, income generation and supply of food in the Caribbean. Transcript Allport	Generally Dominica has always been considered as a food secure nation in terms of its food balance. Generally we have exported more food than we have imported in terms of value. However {{over the last few years}} we have seen some deterioration in the food and nutrition situation because we have seen some declines in the economy. Thorp	So why in particular has there been an impact on the economy, why has that been declining in the last couple of years? Allport	I think the major reason has been the decline of the banana industry and the whole question of the WTO negotiations and the impact on our economy. We now have a very open economy and many times we have been flooded with cheaper imports. That has caused a decline in incomes to farmers and as a result it has caused us to have less disposable income. Thorp	So what are you trying to do as an extension department to try and support farmers in this serious situation? Allport	The most effect that we can have is to try to raise productivity among farmers so that they can increase incomes. But we also would like our production to be consumed locally and many times we bring up issues of protection. Under our WTO obligations we cannot protect but there still is a reason why we need to protect our farmers. Furthermore I think that if our farmers are not protected it means that our country?s ability to even purchase from outside in the long run is affected. So if the economy is totally destroyed our ability to import is also destroyed or compromised. Thorp	And what about trying to diversify? If farmers have relied heavily on growing bananas in the past but this is not going to be a viable option in the future, what other options for growing other crops, perhaps more nutritional crops are there? Allport	Well the options are always there in terms of diversifying to feed our population. That is why I consider us still food secure. But then our ability to export agricultural produce is always compromised. So I think that is where the resources have to be put. Do we really have a comparative advantage in terms of exporting to other countries out there? So I think those are the real issues, it is not just the ability to feed ourselves but can we diversify into other crops that we can export like we did bananas for so many years. Thorp	And what about the issues of raising productivity, I mean how feasible is it to raise productivity beyond what you are doing already? Allport	I think it is feasible. We really have to embrace science and technology. But sometimes - even under our WTO obligations - raising productivity requires infrastructure and sometimes people see the required infrastructure as subsidies and they ask us not to subsidise. When the developed world?s agriculture is highly subsidised both in the EU and in the US. So those are other concerns of ours. Thorp	What about with policymakers, do you feel that they are doing enough to resolve the situation? Allport	I think our policymakers see it, but I think many times our hands are tied in terms of the kind of resources that we can generate to make those changes. I mean we are a poor underdeveloped country striving to compete in the developed world. NARR	In St Kitts and Nevis the government is already in the process of planning which crops it should prioritise, as it reduces its dependence on sugar exports. Jeffrey Berry, an extension officer with the Department of Agriculture, is concerned that this process is ignoring the capacity that the country?s own farmers have, to contribute to the national food supplies. Berry	Yes we have to feed a nation, but are the people, the population, the farmers benefiting from feeding ourselves? Thorp		Presumably they are not? Berry	They are not because what is really happening is that when we set out to look what crops should we produce we are looking from a marketing point of view as to what crops can we produce competitively, not necessarily to feed our nation. So I think somewhere along the line we have to draw the line and to break a kind of equilibrium as to production first of all in feeding yourself, feeding up to at least certain basic commodities. Thorp	Is there a possibility of being able to diversify so that farmers can grow some competitive crops but they can also be encouraged to grow nutritionally valuable crops too? Berry	That is the approach we are trying to do because St Kitts is moving out of sugar right now. I think this year is the last year that we are producing sugar for export. So we are looking at a diversification programme. And I think this is the downfall of the whole thing: we are going about it kind of one sided in the sense that we are just looking at it from a marketing point of view as to what kinds of crops we can produce competitively. I think we have to look at producing other crops that are nutritionally beneficial for the nation, on a smaller scale, but I think that is an integral part that we have to look at apart from the crops that we are producing to be competitive. NARR	While Jeffrey Berry stresses the importance of farmers growing at least some of their crops for domestic consumption, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation is currently running a pilot project to support farmers in production of some alternative cash crops. Sandra Plummer, a food security specialist with the project, which is operating in the 15 member states of CARICOM plus the Dominican Republic, explained how it is working. Plummer	You know that we have a lot of problems in terms of especially sugar and banana because of the erosion of the preferences with the European Union. I think countries are now in transition, in terms of where they should go where they would not be so dependent upon those preferences. Thorp	So what is the FAO pilot project doing to support farmers in this transition phase? Plummer	The project actually is attempting to improve the productivity of these selected crops and it is basically cash crops with the potential for trade in what we call the non-traditional commodities which find markets in places like Canada, the United States. Especially in those areas where you have the West Indian diaspora who are accustomed to eating a particular type of food and they are willing to buy it. So there is a kind of niche market there. Thorp	So what sort of interventions or technologies are you putting into place in order to support the growing of those crops? Plummer	The technology that is being used is drip irrigation because in many countries they have a problem of water and the management of the water. Thorp	So with having irrigation does this allow farmers to grow crops outside the traditional seasons? Plummer	That is exactly the whole point because what happens is that I can give you an example of one village in a country where everybody grew the same kind of crop. So you had a glut during the actual reaping season and then between seasons you had a deficit in terms of availability of food as well as availability of income. So the drip irrigation actually helps to stagger the production throughout the year so that the troughs and the heights of the cycle will actually be reduced. So you get little blips instead of huge hills and valleys. Thorp	So are there countries where there are particular lessons that would be valuable do you think that are already coming out of the project? Plummer	The country which has gone the furthest and has actually started to reap the first crop cycle is Belize. And I think Belize has the advantage and it is probably the reason why they were one of the first countries to actually start the production, in that they already have an intersectoral Animal Health and Food Safety Agency which co-ordinates all the requirements from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture and Trade. And hence it makes it easier for persons who are wishing to export crops. They do not need to go to eight different departments. They can go to one agency and get all the paperwork and documentation done. Thorp		So how do you see the way forward for the future? Plummer	<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of regional development, as in Caribbean region, we hope to get a framework of food and nutrition security strategy for the region, which would then be able to advise programmes and plans of action of the different CARICOM and CARIFORUM member states. I think part of the process is the establishment of, for example, regional databases, regional marketing intelligence, so countries can all access it and be able to trade amongst themselves as well as trade internationally.

In this chapter though, I focus on what this concept might imply for both Henri Bergson - in the context of his broader conception of philosophy as involving an extension of the faculties of perception – and for the (un-) artist Allan Kaprow, particularly in relation to the 1970 s participatory events he referred to as his ‘Activities’ (as distinct from his better known ‘Happenings’). <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> of the book's theme of ‘visual learning’, the chapter reflects on both Bergson and Kaprow’s discussions of the relationship between seeing and doing, juxtaposing Bergson’s concern for the utilitarian and limited nature of a perception bound up with action, with Kaprow’s attempt to think beyond a spectator/participant binary in his evaluation of the specificity of ‘watching in the midst of doing’. Throughout though, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> less <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the visual as a discrete realm, and more <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of attention and learning as fundamentally embodied activities.

He defends the right to have an approach to cooking and eating that does not fit in with conventional distinctions and barriers: [...] "You can be vegetarian and eat fish ... there are no hard core divisions any more". This remark led to controversy within the vegetarian community encouraging Ottolenghi to later recant via Twitter: [...] "To all, fish eaters are NOT vegetarians". Author of [...] "The New Vegetarian" [...] column in The Guardian magazine from 1996 to 2010, his weekly recipe contributions were, at first, exclusively vegetarian although, again, he courted controversy by mentioning where a particular dish would work well with a cut of meat or fish. Maintaining his position against the traditional distinctions and barriers between meat and vegetables - [...] "I'm not burdened by rules, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of ideology" [...] - his relationship with vegetables is to [...] "celebrate vegetables or pulses without making them taste like meat, or as complements to meat, but to be what they are. It does no favour to vegetarians, making vegetables second best. Meat should be a celebration, not everyday. There is so much else out there". The recipes in his column in The Guardian have been expanded to include meat since 2010. Plenty and Plenty More, Ottolenghi's sole-authored recipe collections, are entirely vegetarian. His two books co-authored with Sami Tamimi, Ottolenghi and Jerusalem, include meat and fish dishes.|$|R
