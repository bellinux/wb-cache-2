50|$|The League Against Cruel Sports {{estimates}} some 12,300 wild {{mammals and}} birds are killed on UK shooting estates {{every day and}} sees <b>gamekeepers</b> as playing {{a key role in}} the destruction of wildlife. On the other hand, the shooting industry says that <b>gamekeepers</b> are vital wildlife conservation workers in the countryside. The National <b>Gamekeeper's</b> Organisation (NGO) claims that nine times as much of the British countryside is looked after by <b>gamekeepers</b> as is in nature reserves and National Parks.|$|R
50|$|The book The Long Affray {{describes}} 38 violent {{fights in}} the 19th century and 3 in the 18th century, some with shooting and/or death, of <b>gamekeepers</b> plus their helpers versus poachers. Between 1833 and 1843 42 British <b>gamekeepers</b> {{lost their lives}} in such incidents. Between autumn 1860 and the end of 1861, over 40 <b>gamekeepers</b> were injured in Staffordshire, some grievously, in fights involving nearly 100 poachers.|$|R
5|$|At last, on Monday, 28 June 1841 {{the curtain}} rose on Giselle at the Salle Le Peletier. Grisi danced Giselle with Lucien Petipa as her lover Albrecht, Jean Coralli as the <b>gamekeeper</b> Hilarion, and Adèle Dumilâtre as Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis. Typical of the {{theatrical}} {{practices of the}} time, Giselle was preceded by an excerpt from another production—in this case, the third act of Rossini's opera, Mosè in Egitto.|$|E
5|$|Hilarion, a local <b>gamekeeper,</b> {{is also in}} {{love with}} Giselle and is highly {{suspicious}} of the newcomer who has won Giselle's affections. He tries to convince the naive Giselle that her beau cannot be trusted, but she ignores his warnings. Giselle's mother, Berthe, is very protective of her daughter, as Giselle has a weak heart that leaves her in delicate health. She discourages a relationship between Giselle and Loys, and disapproves of Giselle's fondness for dancing.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} years saw several improvements on Swan's record, {{but the first}} competitive race was held on 3 June 1898 under Scottish Amateur Athletic Association rules. Ten competitors ran the course, which started at the Lochiel Arms Hotel in Banavie and was thus longer than the route from Fort William; the winner was 21-year-old Hugh Kennedy, a <b>gamekeeper</b> at Tor Castle, who finished (coincidentally with Swan's original run) in 2hours 41minutes.|$|E
50|$|Bullmastiffs {{are a large}} working breed {{originating}} in Britain in the mid 1800s as estate guardians to ward off poachers. They were bred by <b>gamekeepers</b> for strength, size and speed using a cross of the tough, heavy and aggressive Bulldog of the 19th century with the large, strong, less aggressive Mastiff. As a result, the Bullmastiff {{is known as the}} <b>Gamekeeper's</b> Night Dog. The preferred color, by <b>gamekeepers,</b> was brindle, as this color works as a more effective camouflage, especially at night.|$|R

5|$|The {{stretch of}} {{causeway}} on Wheeldale Moor was cleared of vegetation and excavated {{in the early}} twentieth century by a local <b>gamekeeper</b> with an interest in archaeology. Historian Ivan Margary agreed with its identification as a Roman road, and assigned it the catalogue number 81b in the first edition of his Roman Roads In Britain (1957). The causeway was further excavated and studied by archaeologist Raymond Hayes in the 1950s and 1960s, partially funded by the Council for British Archaeology. The results of his investigation, which concluded that the structure was a Roman road, were published in 1964 by the Scarborough Archaeological and Historical Society.|$|E
5|$|In {{the land}} {{adjacent}} to Carthy's Castle is Orlagh House {{which has been}} owned by the Augustinian Order since the mid-nineteenth century and is a retreat and conference centre run by the friars. It was built in 1790 by Mr Lundy Foot, a wealthy snuff merchant, who named the house Footmount. He was also a magistrate and was instrumental in condemning {{three members of the}} Kearney family to death for the murder of John Kinlan, the <b>gamekeeper</b> at Friarstown, near Bohernabreena, in 1816. Foot was subsequently murdered in 1835, an act that was attributed to relatives of the Kearneys. In fact, Foot was killed by James Murphy, the son of an evicted tenant farmer whose land Foot had bought following the eviction.|$|E
5|$|While {{living in}} exile in Switzerland, after being forced to flee Nazi-occupied Austria, Salten wrote a sequel to Bambi that follows the birth and lives of Bambi's twin offspring, Geno and Gurri. The young fawns {{interact}} with various deer, and are educated and watched over by Bambi and Faline as they grow. They also {{learn more about the}} ways of man, including both hunters and the <b>gamekeeper</b> seeking to protect the deer. Due to Salten's exiled status — he had lost his Austrian publisher Paul Zsolnay Verlag — the English translation of the novel was published first, in the United States in 1939 by Bobbs-Merrill, but it would take a year before the sequel was published in the original German language in Switzerland by his new publisher.|$|E

He is greeted {{by his friend}} Octave (Jean Renoir), who tells André that Christine (Nora Gregor)the Austrian-French noblewoman André loveshas not come to greet him. André is heartbroken. When a radio {{reporter}} comes to broadcast André's first words upon landing, he explains his sorrow and denounces Christine. She is listening to the broadcast in her Paris apartment; she is attended by her maid, Lisette (Paulette Dubost). Christine has been married to Robert, Marquis de la Chesnaye (Marcel Dalio) for three years. For two years, Lisette has been married to Schumacher (Gaston Modot)the <b>gamekeeper</b> at Robert's country estatebut she is more devoted to Christine. Christine's past relationship with André is openly known by her husband, her maid and their friend Octave. After Christine and Robert playfully discuss André's emotional display and pledge devotion to each another, Robert excuses himself to make a telephone call. He arranges to meet his mistress Geneviève (Mila Parély) the next morning.|$|E
5|$|This sparks the rumour mill yet again, as {{students}} {{around the school}} suspect Harry of being the Heir of Slytherin (as Slytherin was also a parselmouth), and circumstantial evidence to support this theory arrives {{in the form of}} another attack, this time on Hufflepuff second-year Justin Finch Fletchley and the Gryffindor ghost. Harry, Ron, and Hermione begin to suspect that Draco is behind the attacks, given his family history of remaining well within Slytherin ranks and open hostility toward Muggle-born students, and so Hermione concocts Polyjuice potion, which allows them to become Draco’s boorish lackeys, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, for an hour to interrogate him. This comes to nothing, as Draco’s father only told his son the general facts of the previous opening of the Chamber and that it occurred fifty years previously. Meanwhile, Myrtle Warren, an existentially mopey ghost that haunts a bathroom, unwittingly provides a new clue {{in the form of a}} diary deposited in her stall—a diary, moreover, that belonged to Tom Riddle, a student who knows all too well about the Chamber, having been witness to a fellow student’s death fifty years ago. The culprit, he reveals to Harry, was none other than Rubeus Hagrid, now <b>gamekeeper</b> for Hogwarts School; when Hermione is attacked next, alongside a Ravenclaw prefect, the school is put on lockdown, and Dumbledore and Hagrid are forced to leave the premises.|$|E

5000|$|A {{dominant}} feature of Redstone is Cleveholm Manor, commonly called [...] "Redstone Castle," [...] an opulent 42-room Tudor-style mansion that Osgood built {{for his second}} wife, Swedish Countess Alma Regina Shelgrem. Construction of Cleveholm Manor, which was designed by New York architects Boal and Harnois, began in 1897 and was completed in 1901. The Castle {{was part of a}} 72 acre estate that also included servants' quarters, a <b>gamekeeper's</b> lodge, a carriage house, and a greenhouse. Cleveholm Manor and the <b>gamekeeper's</b> cottage are both independently listed on the National Register as Osgood Castle and Osgood <b>Gamekeeper's</b> Lodge, respectively. As of 2004, the Castle still contained 75 percent of its original furnishings.|$|R

50|$|Symptoms of <b>gamekeeper's</b> thumb are {{instability}} of the MCP joint of the thumb, accompanied by pain and {{weakness of the}} pinch grasp.

50|$|<b>Gamekeeper's</b> {{thumb and}} skier's thumb are two similar conditions, {{both of which}} involve {{insufficiency}} of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the thumb. The chief {{difference between these two}} conditions is that Skier's thumb is generally considered to be an acute condition acquired after a fall or similar abduction injury to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the thumb, whereas <b>gamekeeper's</b> thumb typically refers to a chronic condition which has developed as a result of repeated episodes of lower-grade hyperabduction over a period of time. <b>Gamekeeper's</b> thumb is more difficult to treat because the UCL has lengthened and become thinner as a result of repeated injury. It is moderately painful compared to similar injuries.|$|R
