5|$|After Actium and {{the defeat}} of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a {{position}} to rule the entire Republic under an unofficial principate—but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> by courting the Senate and the people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, appearing that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy. Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the Senate.|$|E

5|$|Did Harrison {{deliberately}} use {{the music}} of He's So Fine? I do not believe <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> deliberately.

This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished.|$|E

Having adopted a pay-as-you-go {{program for the}} state, {{he was forced to}} raise additional revenue after the war ended. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> by imposing sin taxes on cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, and parimutuel betting, but he was unable to convince the General Assembly to adopt a sales tax.|$|E

5|$|While the {{procession}} was an actual historic event, Matejko took many artistic liberties, such as including persons {{who were not}} in fact present or had died earlier. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> because he intended the painting to be a synthesis of {{the final years of}} the Commonwealth. He also felt that there was no real historic moment or location that fully captured the spirit of the Constitution, and so he, the artist, needed to create such a moment.|$|E

5|$|Another {{attempt was}} made to collect a {{specimen}} by Lord Crawford on his yacht Valhalla in 1905. A final {{attempt was made}} during the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, which passed by in April 1922 on its way back to Britain. This visit also failed, but members of the expedition left collecting material with a Rev. H. M. C. Rogers, then chaplain on Tristan da Cunha. The following year two study skins arrived in the Natural History Museum, London, followed soon after by another skin and a specimen in spirits. Physician Percy Lowe was then able to use the skins to describe the species. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>so,</b> briefly, {{at a meeting of the}} British Ornithologists' Club, in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Colorado, McDonald {{found himself}} at the centre of another power struggle.

But <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> without gaining the approval of general manager Ray Miron, who disagreed frequently with Cherry and fired him following the season. On the ice, McDonald scored 35goals with the Rockies and finished with a total of 40 between the two teams.|$|E
5|$|As local {{hostilities}} {{between the}} loyalists and revolutionaries escalated in the build-up to the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), Crèvecœur {{decided to return}} to France; scholars have suggested that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> in order to secure his legal claim to his patrimony. Upon his arrival in New York City in 1778, Crèvecœur found himself under suspicion of being a Revolutionary spy and was detained; whilst in detention, he suffered a nervous collapse. He was released to travel in September 1780, and traveled to London after landing in Ireland. There, he sold the manuscript of Letters to publishers Davies & Davis before leaving for France.|$|E

5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out on the train from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E

He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by his father on his deathbed always to heed the welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military, and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> with generous pay raises and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.|$|E
5|$|Following the season, the Rangers did not {{exercise}} their option, and traded Fleury's playing {{rights to the}} San Jose Sharks, which entitled the Sharks to a compensatory draft pick if Fleury signed elsewhere. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> with a two-year, $8.5million contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. Two days prior {{to the opening of}} the 2002–03 season, he was suspended by the NHL for violating the terms of the league's substance abuse program. The Blackhawks hired one of Fleury's friends, also a recovering alcoholic, to ensure that he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and abided by the terms of the NHL's aftercare program.|$|E
