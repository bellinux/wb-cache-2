5|$|Governors who had {{previously}} been legislators have generally <b>had</b> <b>greater</b> success in achieving their legislative goals while governor. Three speakers of the house have become governor. Governor Joseph A. Wright had the worst relations of any governor with the assembly. He twice delivered speeches to a joint session where he harangued them for what he perceived to be corruption, accusing them of taking bribes from the Bank of Indiana. The legislature responded by overriding all his anti-banking vetoes. He was so disliked by his own party that he was expelled from it after his term.|$|E

Using gender schema and social power theories, we posit that female faculty members will be perceived by students as <b>having</b> <b>greater</b> referent power and that male faculty members will be perceived by students as <b>having</b> <b>greater</b> expert, legitimate, reward and coercive power. Results of a survey involving 892 students at two universities indicate that male faculty members are perceived as <b>having</b> <b>greater</b> expert power, while no gender differences exist on referent, reward and coercive power. Contrary to our hypotheses, female faculty members are perceived as <b>having</b> <b>greater</b> legitimate power...|$|R

5|$|In Britain the Scottish Crop Research Institute was {{tasked with}} {{developing}} new varieties suitable for {{growing in the}} north of the country. They produced new cultivars that <b>had</b> <b>greater</b> cold tolerance, especially in the spring, ripened earlier and more evenly and <b>had</b> <b>greater</b> fungal disease resistance. Frost tolerance was improved by selecting for late flowering and genetic research identified genes involved in resistance to gall mite and the blackcurrant reversion virus. 'Ben Lomond' {{was the first of the}} 'Ben' varieties and was released in 1975. This was followed by several other cultivars for the juicing industry such as 'Ben Alder' and 'Ben Tirran'. The cultivar 'Ben Hope' was released in 1998 with increased tolerance to gall mite, and in the same year, 'Ben Gairn' became available. It shows resistance to the reversion virus. For gardeners and the pick-your-own market, 'Ben Sarek', 'Ben Connan' and 'Big Ben' were introduced and have large, sweet berries. The cultivars 'Ben Connan', 'Ben Lomond' and 'Ben Sarek' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost tolerance, disease resistance, machine harvesting, fruit quality, nutritional content and fruit flavour.|$|E

Fighter Command had <b>had</b> <b>greater</b> success against the afternoon attack rather than the morning assault, which it out numbered 2:1. The ratio of German fighters to bombers had been 3:1 in the morning but 5:1 in the afternoon, so there were more targets. The more bombers Kesselring sent, the more were lost.|$|E

He scored 1,137 runs {{at an average of}} 27.73. He made centuries in the two matches against Northamptonshire, sharing big partnerships in both games: 276 with Rhodes in the first and 299 with Percy Holmes in the second. His overall performance left him sixth in the Yorkshire batting averages, and fourth in the bowling averages. Through the winter, he continued to develop his bowling.|$|E

5|$|Prey {{mobility}} {{could also}} explain the initial development of aposematic signaling. If prey have characteristics {{that make them}} more exposed to predators, such as when some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, then they have more reason to develop aposematism. After the switch, the frogs <b>had</b> <b>greater</b> ecological opportunities, causing dietary specialization to arise. Thus, aposematism {{is not merely a}} signaling system, but a way for organisms to gain greater access to resources and increase their reproductive success.|$|E
5|$|The HVO, {{supported}} by Croatian Army artillery deployed {{north of the}} river, managed to withstand the offensive and the front line remained unchanged from the commencement of the battle.

5|$|The Wild Weasels {{also carried}} {{electronic}} countermeasures (ECM) equipment to protect themselves.

A sophisticated cat and mouse game then ensued between North Vietnamese radar operators and the Wild Weasel pilots.|$|E

5|$|A small navy had {{operated}} at {{a fairly}} low level after the Second Samnite War, {{but it was}} massively upgraded during this period, expanding from a few primarily river- and coastal-based patrol craft to a full maritime unit. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the Carthaginian pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size. This was partially because a pacified Roman Mediterranean called for little naval policing, and partially because the Romans chose to rely during this period on ships provided by Greek cities, whose peoples <b>had</b> <b>greater</b> maritime experience.|$|E
5|$|Altrincham has two theatres, the Altrincham Garrick Playhouse and the Club Theatre (latterly {{known as}} the Altrincham Little Theatre). The Altrincham Garrick group was formed in 1913. The Garrick held the world stage premier of Psycho in 1982. In 1998, it {{received}} a grant of £675,000 from the National Lottery {{as part of a}} £900,000 redevelopment of the theatre, which was completed in 1999. The Club Theatre group began in 1896, as the St Margaret's Church Institute Amateur Dramatics Society. It provides a venue for the Trafford Youth Theatre production each year, and it runs the Hale One Act Festival, an annual week-long event started in 1972. The club has received awards from both the Greater Manchester Drama Federation and the Cheshire Theatre Guild. Altrincham also <b>had</b> <b>Greater</b> Manchester's only Michelin starred restaurant, the Juniper.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham still flew on operations. Flying the new Beaufighter II {{powered by}} Merlin engines on an {{interception}} in July, {{he was hit}} by return fire from a He 111. The engines spluttered and one caught fire. Already far out to sea he flew back to base, extinguished the fire and made a wheels-down landing. The following month he <b>had</b> <b>greater</b> success. On the night of the 22 August 1941 he intercepted two He 111s. One was claimed as damaged but the second was confirmed. The Heinkel He 111, an H-5 model, Werknummer 4081, coded F8+BS belonging to 8./Kampfgeschwader 40 (KG 40), fell into the sea north-west of Wells, Somerset at 22.05. Gefreiter G. Dohmen, H. Hädrich, and K. Dändel were never found. The body of Rudolf Faath was washed ashore at Burnham Overy on 31 August. On 1 September Cunningham caught and downed a Ju 88—his 15th victory. He was awarded a bar to his DFC on 19 September, by which time he was an acting wing commander.|$|E
5|$|Eastern Air Lines {{operated}} {{the first commercial}} 757 flight on January 1, 1983, on the Atlanta-to-Tampa route. On February 9, 1983, British Airways began using the aircraft for London-to-Belfast shuttle services, where it replaced Hawker Siddeley Trident 3B trijets. Charter carriers Monarch Airlines and Air Europe also began 757 operations later that year. Early operators noted improved reliability and quieter performance compared with previous jetliners. Transition courses eased pilots' introduction to the new CRT-based cockpit, and no major technical issues arose. Eastern Air Lines, the first 727 operator to take delivery of 757s, confirmed that the aircraft <b>had</b> <b>greater</b> payload capability than its predecessor, along with lower operating costs through improved fuel burn {{and the use of}} a two-crew member flight deck. Compared with the 707 and 727, the new twinjet consumed 42 and 40percent less fuel per seat, respectively, on typical medium-haul flights.|$|E
5|$|Grant's policy <b>had</b> <b>greater</b> {{success in}} the Southwest. General Oliver Otis Howard {{negotiated}} peace with the Apache in 1872, convincing their leader, Cochise, to move the tribe to a new reservation, and ending a war started the year before. In Oregon, relations were less peaceful, as war with the Modocs erupted in April 1873. The Modocs refused {{to move to a}} reservation and killed the local army commander, Major General Edward Canby. Grant ordered restraint after Canby's death, disregarding Sherman's advice to seek revenge or exterminate the tribe. The army captured, tried, and executed the four Modoc warriors responsible for Canby's murder, and Grant ordered the rest of the Modoc tribe relocated to the Indian Territory. In 1874, the army defeated the Comanche Indians at the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon. Their villages were burned and horses slaughtered, eventually forcing them to finally settle at the Fort Sill reservation in 1875. Grant pocket-vetoed a bill in 1874 protecting bison and supporting Interior Secretary Columbus Delano, who believed the killing of bison would force Plains Indians to abandon their nomadic lifestyle.|$|E
