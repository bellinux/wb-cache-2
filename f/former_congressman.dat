Although Goebel's allies attempted to defend him against the charges, Stone's story was soon corroborated by <b>former</b> <b>congressman</b> W. C. Owens. Owens called on Democrats to vote for the Republican candidate, and to do so in such large numbers that no amount of political wrangling by Goebel could give him the governorship.|$|E

5|$|Desha's {{trial began}} January 17, 1825, in Cynthiana. William K.

Barry, <b>former</b> <b>Congressman</b> William Brown, T. P. Taul, and James Crawford. It took two days to empanel a jury. Witness testimony consumed the next week, and Governor Desha attended each day of the trial. The closing statements of Rowan and Barry, both known as outstanding orators, took several days, and Chambers spoke last.|$|E
5|$|Despite his proclaimed lack of {{interest}} in the gubernatorial nomination, Brown's name was entered as a candidate on the first ballot, along with Parker Watkins Hardin, <b>former</b> <b>Congressman</b> William J. Stone, and William Goebel, President Pro Tempore of the state senate. The convention was thrown into chaos when a widely known agreement between Stone and Goebel – designed to get Hardin out of the race – broke down. As balloting continued over the next four days (Sunday excepted) with no candidate receiving a majority, Brown continued to receive a few votes on each ballot. Finally, the convention delegates decided to drop the candidate with the lowest vote total until one candidate received a majority; this resulted in the nomination of Goebel a few ballots later.|$|E
