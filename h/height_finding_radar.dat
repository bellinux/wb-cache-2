25|$|Following a month's stay at {{her home}} port, the {{aircraft}} carrier headed for New York and a major overhaul. Shangri-La was modified extensively during her stay in the yard. Four of her 5in (127mm) mounts were removed, but she received a new air search and <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radar</b> and a new arrester system. In addition, much of her electrical and engineering equipment was renovated. After sea trials and visits to Bayonne and Norfolk, Shangri-La returned to Mayport for a week in late March 1963; then put to sea for operations in the Caribbean. Eight months of similar duty followed before Shangri-La weighed anchor for another deployment. On 1 October 1963, she {{headed back to the}} 6th Fleet for a seven-month tour.|$|E

50|$|The {{information}} provided by 3D radar has long been required, particularly for air defence and interception. Interceptors must be told the altitude to climb to before making an intercept. Before the advent of single unit 3D radars, this was achieved with separate search radars (giving range and azimuth) and separate <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radars</b> that could examine a target to determine altitude. These had little search capability, so were directed to a particular azimuth first found by the primary search radar.|$|R
5000|$|The JLP-40 is a {{tactical}} air defense radar designed {{to use with}} <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radars</b> such as the JLG-43 Radar. It is similar in design to the Russian [...] "Bar Lock" [...] series radar {{and may have been}} derived from it as part of the sale of the SA-2 system from the Former Soviet Union in the early 1960s. It features the same arrangement of the two large scanners attached to front and ear sides of a rotating cabin that houses the transmitter/receivers.|$|R
5000|$|The Fort Heath {{radar station}} was a USAF radar site and US Army Missile Master {{installation}} of the joint-use site system (JUSS) for North American Air Defense. The Cold War radar station had 2 USAF AN/FPS-6B <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radars,</b> 2 Army AN/FPS-6A height finders, an FAA ARSR-1 radar emplaced 1958-9, and an Army nuclear bunker. Arctic Towers were the pedestals for the FPS antennas and radomes, while the Air Route Surveillance Radar was on a 50-foot extension temperate tower adjacent to the Federal Aviation Administration building.|$|R

5000|$|An E-scope is {{essentially}} a B-scope displaying range vs. elevation, rather than range vs. azimuth. They are identical in operation to the B-scope, the name simply indicating [...] "elevation". E-scopes are typically used with <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radars,</b> which are similar to airborne radars but turned to scan vertically instead of horizontally, they are also {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "nodding radars" [...] due to their antenna's motion. The display tube was generally rotated 90 degrees to put the elevation axis vertical in order to provide a more obvious correlation between the display and the [...] "real world". These displays are also referred to as a Range-Height Indicator, or RHI, but were also commonly referred to (confusingly) as a B-scope as well.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operator}} slews {{the antenna}} toward a desired bearing, identifies a target echo at a desired range on the RHI display (RHI = range height indicator), then bisects the target with a cursor that is scaled {{to indicate the}} approximate altitude of the target. [...] Such systems often complement 2-dimensional radars which find distance and direction (search radar); thus using two 2-dimensional systems to obtain a 3-dimensional aerial picture. <b>Height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radars</b> of the 1960s and 70s were distinguished by their antenna being tall, but narrow. As beam shape {{is a function of}} antenna shape, the height finder beam was flat and wide horizontally (i.e., not very good at determining bearing to the target), but very thin vertically, allowing accurate measurement of elevation angle, thus altitude.|$|R
2500|$|Symmetric {{parabolic}} antennas {{produce a}} narrow [...] "pencil" [...] beam {{in both the}} X and Y dimensions and consequently have a higher gain. The NEXRAD Pulse-Doppler weather radar uses a symmetric antenna to perform detailed volumetric scans of the atmosphere. Spoiled parabolic antennas produce a narrow beam in one dimension and a relatively wide beam in the other. This feature is useful if target detection {{over a wide range}} of angles is more important than target location in three dimensions. [...] Most 2D surveillance radars use a spoiled parabolic antenna with a narrow azimuthal beamwidth and wide vertical beamwidth. This beam configuration allows the radar operator to detect an aircraft at a specific azimuth but at an indeterminate height. Conversely, so-called [...] "nodder" [...] <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radars</b> use a dish with a narrow vertical beamwidth and wide azimuthal beamwidth to detect an aircraft at a specific height but with low azimuthal precision.|$|R

50|$|Basis {{equipment}} of {{the unit}} includes search radar, {{the only one of}} its particular type in the Bangor Sector; an unmanned search radar at Topsfield, Maine, 90 miles northeast of the squadron site; a <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radar</b> complex; a digital data transmitted and data-link transmitter.|$|E
50|$|As it {{was growing}} into its role, St Sylvestre hosted a {{training}} detachment of No. 1 Radar and Communications School, (RCAF Station Clinton), from May 1954 until May 1955.

5000|$|The {{advent of}} the kamikaze {{demonstrated}} {{the need for a}} long range radar umbrella around the fleet. Radar picket destroyers and destroyer escorts were put into service, but they proved vulnerable in this role as they could be attacked as well, leaving the fleet blind. A submarine, though, could dive and escape aerial attack. Ten fleet submarines were converted for this role 1946-53 and redesignated SSR as radar picket submarines. Three Tench-class boats ( [...] , , and [...] ) were among those converted; the latter two prototyped the concept in 1946. Eventually, the radar pickets were lengthened by 24 feet to provide additional space for an air control center and had powerful air search and <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radars</b> installed, with the after torpedo room converted into an electronics space with torpedoes and tubes removed. They also received a streamlined sail in place of the traditional conning tower fairwater. The most extensive SSR conversion was the [...] "Migraine III" [...] configuration.|$|R

5000|$|The {{advent of}} the Kamikaze {{demonstrated}} {{the need for a}} long-range radar umbrella around the fleet. Surface ships refitted with powerful radar suites were put into service, but they proved vulnerable in this role as they could be attacked as well, leaving the fleet blind. A submarine, though, could dive and escape aerial attack. After experimenting with the concept on several Balao and Tench-class boats, and realizing that a deep diving depth was not overly important in this role, six Gatos were taken in hand ( [...] , , , , , and [...] ) for conversion. They were lengthened by 24 ft to provide additional space for an air control center and had powerful air search and <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radars</b> installed, with the after torpedo room converted into an electronics space with torpedoes and tubes removed. They also received a streamlined [...] "sail" [...] in place of the traditional conning tower fairwater. Redesignated SSR and called the [...] "Migraine III" [...] conversion, these boats were only moderately successful in this role as the radars themselves proved troublesome and somewhat unreliable. The radars were removed and the boats temporarily reverted to general-purpose submarines after 1959.|$|R
5000|$|As converted, each ship {{carried an}} AN/SPS-8 <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radar,</b> AN/SPS-12 air/surface search radar, AN/SPS-17 long range air search radar, and AN/UPA-22 IFF sensor. The AN/SPS-8 was later {{replaced}} on some ships by the AN/SPS-30. The AN/SPS-17, purpose {{built for the}} Guardian class, could detect large aircraft such as bombers up to [...] away and small aircraft up to [...] away.|$|E
5000|$|The JLG-43 radar is a nodding <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radar,</b> a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) radar which only provides azimuth and height data and is normally paired with other air search radars which provides the range {{to complete the}} picture. It {{is very similar to}} the well-known Russian PRV-9 [...] "Thin Skin" [...] and PRV-11 [...] "Side Net" [...] series heightfinding radars. It is a fully mobile system which can be towed and is air transportable.|$|E
50|$|Independence {{was built}} with an angled flight deck with four C-7 steam catapults, {{two on the}} bow and two on the angled deck. She was fitted with AN/SPS-37 {{long-range}} search radar and AN/SPS-8B <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radar.</b> Defensive armament consisted of eight 5"/54 caliber Mark 42 guns mounted on sponsons jutting out {{from the sides of}} the ship so they did not interfere with the flight deck. The initial air wing of the Forrestal-class carriers was about 90 aircraft, although this varied with the composition of the airwing.|$|E
50|$|In 1947 the {{regiment}} was reformed as 428 The Princess Beatrice's (Isle of Wight Rifles) Coast Regiment, RA, but in 1949 it was converted as 428 The Princess Beatrice's (Isle of Wight Rifles) (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, with three batteries based at Ryde, Newport and Cowes with RHQ at Newport. They were armed with 3.7 HAA Guns and associated radars and predictors. The term 'Mixed' {{in the title}} indicated {{that members of the}} Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit. They were briefly responsible for the manning of the 5.25 gun sites on the Island. After the demise of Anti-Aircraft Command and the reduction in air defence units in 1955, the Rifles were once again renamed, now becoming P (Princess Beatrice's IoW Rifles) Battery in 457 (Wessex) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, equipped with mobile 3.7 guns. When {{the regiment}} te-equipped with Thunderbird SAMs the battery became P HQ Bty 457 Heavy Air Defence Regt RA TA (The IoW Rifles) The Hampshire Caribineers Yeomanry. The main element of the battery was the Regimental Surveillance Troop with 4 mk 7 & <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radars.</b> They had received two Distinguished Service Orders, a Distinguished Conduct Medal, four Military Crosses, seven Military Medals and various mentions in despatches during their wartime service.|$|R

5000|$|Experiments in {{addressing}} this problem started with manually directed radars {{being used as}} a sort of radio-searchlight, but this proved too difficult to use in practice. Another attempt was made by using a <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radar</b> turned on its side in order to scan an arc in front of the station. This proved very workable, and was soon extended to covering a full 360 degrees by making minor changes to the support and bearing systems. Making a display system, the [...] "Plan Position Indicator" [...] (PPI), that displayed a 360 degree pattern proved surprisingly easy, and test systems were available by late 1940.|$|E
50|$|The AN/FPS-6 Radar was a {{long-range}} <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radar</b> {{used by the}} United States Air Force's Air Defense Command. The AN/FPS-6 radar was introduced into service in the late 1950s and served as the principal height-finder radar for the United States for several decades thereafter. It was also used by the Royal Air Force alongside their Type 80 radars. Built by General Electric, the S-band radar operated on a frequency of 2700 to 2900 MHz. Between 1953 and 1960, about 450 units of the AN/FPS-6 and the mobile AN/MPS-14 version were produced. The AN/FPS-90 and AN/FPS-116 radars were identical to the AN/FPS-6 except for receiver modifications.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} overcoming much of the computational expense of <b>finding</b> <b>radar</b> altitude and determining lines of sight in flight simulations over databases built from polygons.

50|$|There {{were three}} <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> {{facilities}} within the Linesman system. One was {{built into the}} Type 85 radar, the second was a stand-alone system using the HF200 radar and the third {{was based on the}} SSR interrogating the aircraft's systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{system is}} {{designed}} {{to make use of}} amplitude comparison for <b>height</b> <b>finding.</b> With the aid of two computers, it is able to provide automatically accurate real-time 3D information on targets.

5000|$|The next {{design was}} for an unarmored cruiser of {{displacement}} similar to Italian s {{to carry the}} new 5 inch/54 caliber Mark 42 gun. Each of the four [...] ships received somewhat different experimental propulsion machinery powered by [...] (8.3 MPa) Combustion Engineering forced-circulation boilers in DL-2 and DL-3; and Foster Wheeler boilers in DL-4 and DL-5. DL-2 and DL-3 had General Electric turbines while DL-4 and DL-5 had Westinghouse turbines. All four ships began operations in the Atlantic. DL-3 and DL-5 were transferred to the Pacific in 1956. DL-3 made routine deployments to the western Pacific {{for as long as}} she remained in commission, but DL-5 was transferred back to the Atlantic in 1963 after making a few western Pacific deployments. DL-2 and DL-4 made routine deployments to the Mediterranean Sea. The ships were built with AN/SPS-6 air search radar, AN/SPS-8 <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radar,</b> AN/QHBa scanning sonar and AN/SQG-1 attack sonar. During their first refit in the mid-1950s the AN/SQG-1 and AN/QHBa were replaced by AN/SQS-4 sonar and the secondary open 3 inch/50 caliber guns were replaced by 3 inch/70 Mark 26 guns. Later refits removed the unsatisfactory 3 inch/70 guns and Weapon Alpha. After experimental flight operations with the Bell HUL-1 and Kaman HTK-1 aboard Mitscher in 1957, helicopter decks and hangars for the Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH were installed where the aft 3 inch guns had been. DL-2 and DL-3 underwent major overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard beginning in 1966 including new Foster Wheeler boilers, AN/SQS-23 sonar, AN/SPS-37 air search radar, AN/SPS-48 <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radar,</b> and the Tartar Guided Missile Fire Control System for RIM-24 Tartar missiles. DL-4 and DL-5 had earlier received a new 70-foot bow section mounting the AN/SQS-26 sonar and spent the remainder of their service lives testing these prototypes until retirement, when their sisters emerged from overhaul at Philadelphia in 1968 for another decade of service as guided missile destroyers.|$|E
5000|$|Roosevelt was {{the first}} of her class to undergo the SCB-110 reconstruction, at a cost of $48 million. She {{received}} an enclosed [...] "hurricane bow," [...] one C-11-2 and two C-11-1 steam catapults, strengthened arresting gear, an enlarged bridge, a mirror landing system, and a 482 ft angled flight deck. SPS-8 <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> <b>radar</b> and SPS-12 air search radar were mounted on a new tubular mast. The aft elevator was relocated to the starboard deck edge, the forward elevator was enlarged, and all elevators were uprated to 75,000 lb capacity. Aviation fuel bunkerage was increased from 350,000 to 450,000 gallons (1,320,000 to 1,700,000 L). Standard displacement rose to 51,000 tons, while deep load displacement rose to 63,400 tons. As weight compensation, several of the 5 in Mark 16 anti-aircraft guns were landed, leaving only 10, and the 3,200-ton armor belt was removed. Hull blisters were also added to cope with the increased weight. Roosevelt recommissioned on 6 April 1956.|$|E
50|$|Studied in 1979 by Sims & O'Brien K., a {{study of}} 1992 found that many suicidal acts of falling from height were done by young males that were {{unemployed}} and single.

50|$|Sir Robert Alexander Watson-Watt, KCB, FRS, FRAeS (13 April 1892 - 5 December 1973) was a Scottish {{pioneer of}} radio {{direction}} <b>finding</b> and <b>radar</b> technology.|$|R
50|$|The core to {{the system}} were the Type 84 & 85 primary <b>radars.</b> <b>Height</b> <b>finding</b> {{capability}} {{was provided by the}} Type 85 (one of the first 3D radars) and the HF200 Height Finders. As Linesman progressed additional systems were introduced to aid ECCM capability and communications. Each primary radar had an associated secondary radar (IFF), SSR 750, with the smaller secondary radar mounted on the main primary radar aerial.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmitter}} was a British MB3 model {{which put}} out 250 Kw of power at 42.5 MHz. The frequency {{was in the}} VHF band which would later become common for use in television transmission, but in 1943 this short wavelength was unfamiliar technology. The transmitter aerial system was in two parts set at different heights (at 37.2 and 14.3 metres high) to enable <b>height</b> <b>finding</b> using the floodlit system. Each part had four elements to cover four sectors of 120 degrees.|$|R
