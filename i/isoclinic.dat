50|$|The basic {{advantage}} of a circular polariscope over a plane polariscope {{is that in a}} circular polariscope setup we only get the isochromatics and not the <b>isoclinics.</b> This eliminates the problem of differentiating between the <b>isoclinics</b> and the isochromatics.|$|R
40|$|A {{photoelastic}} {{image processing}} method which analyzes simultaneously the isochromatics and the <b>isoclinics</b> is presented. The photoelastic images are obtained by an infrared vidicon tube having unstable sensitivity. The values of the isochromatics and the <b>isoclinics</b> in the whole region are determined {{by means of a}} least-squares method from some photoelastic image data obtained under the plane polarized light. For this determination, it is required that the values of the isochromatics and the <b>isoclinics</b> at two reference points be known.

40|$|These authors {{published}} theoretical results {{upon the}} stress state induced in an elastic half-plane containing a circular hole by a point force applied on its boundary. The solutions {{were found in}} bipolar co-ordinates and by expansion of potential functions in Fourier series. The drawback is a weak convergence of stress function on the straight boundary and in its neighbourhood. This paper aims to validate the theoretical results by means of photo-elasticity. The theoretic fields of isoclinicsand of isochromatics are compared with those experimentally found. This comparison reveals an excellent agreement {{in the case of}} iso-chromatics. The analysis of <b>isoclinics</b> is more difficult because they loose sharpness as the observed point departures from load point. In exchange, it is easier to identify the singular points of <b>isoclinics.</b> Theoretically, it is difficult to identify all singular points because of the weak convergence of stress function. The authors found these points by a bi-univocal correspondence between a half-plane containing a circular hole and a circular annulus. This correspondence preserves the connection order. Because the singular points for a circular annulus are determined theoretically and experimentally, all singular points in the holed elastic half-plane are found by correspondence. These results are experimentally confirmed...|$|R

The method {{is based on the}} integration of two difference equations by use of a multigrid algorithm, using a quality map obtained from experimental data by checking the consistency of the generated experimental differences. So-called isostatic sulfaces are determined and, from them, the isostatics net can be drawn with any prescribed density and resolution. The algorithm is very robust and fast and has proven very efficient for working with real photoelastic fringe patterns...|$|R

The trajectory is valid only in the elastic region {{at the tip of the}} crack and not in cases where plasticity exists. It would be relatively easy to check that the predicted stress trajectories correspond to the true trajectories by deriving them from <b>isoclinics</b> determined in a photoelastic model.

40|$|Abstract. A {{multi-purpose}} polariscope {{was developed}} by applying an electro-mechanical control system to a diffused transmission-type circular polariscope. A conventional polariscope is only good for manual control of optical elements. The new polariscope system was devised to be controlled through two stepping motors and two magnetic clutches. The new polariscope can be used {{not only for the}} point-wise measurement using Tardy compensation technique but also for the full-field fringe analysis using conventional and/or phase measuring techniques, if applicable. The distributions of digitally determined unwrapped <b>isoclinics</b> and isochromatics using the digitized images obtained from the developed polariscope were in close agreement to manual measurements...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method of error {{analysis}} {{that can be applied}} for phase-measuring algorithms applied to photoelasticity. We calculate the contributions to the measurement error of the different elements of a circular polariscope as perturbations of the Jones matrices associated with each element. The Jones matrix of the real polariscope can then be calculated as a sum of the nominal matrix and a series of contributions that depend on the errors associated with each element separately. We apply this method to the analysis of phase-measuring algorithms for the determination of <b>isoclinics</b> and isochromatics, including comparisons with real measurements. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{research}} of photoelasticity, photoelastic fringe patterns are obtained through a circular polariscope with different optical arrangements {{and they are}} processed with image processing techniques in a personal computer. Image processing techniques are reviewed and discussed for stress analysis of the photoelastic fringes in this paper. The image processing techniques include fringe sharpening, fringe multiplication, and 8 -step phase measuring technique. Gradient descent process is used for fringe sharpening. In fringe multiplication, fringes are multiplied twice for limited fringe order. 8 -step phase measuring technique is used to separate <b>isoclinics</b> and isochromatics.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{application}} of a regularization algorithm to the processing of photoelastic fringe patterns. The method used is a modified regularized phase-tracking (RPT) algorithm applied to phase-shifted images. In particular, we present an algorithm for isoclinic-isochromatic separation that uses only five images. In the case of <b>isoclinics</b> the method can deal with problems associated with modulation of isochromatics and with isotropic points by means of a modified cost functional. With respect to the isochromatics the problems associated with regions of high fringe density are solved in a robust way by the unmodified RPT algorithm by use of the modulation information. The performance of the method is discussed, and experimental results are presented...|$|R

Some singular points are observed in an U notch type, and double notch type has one more singular point compare with a single notch type.

The easiest way to build the combined system is to employ a laser light source. However, coherent illumination introduces a signal-dependent speckle noise which worsens the accurate phase estimation and unwrapping. To {{answer the question of}} how it affects the phase retrieval of isochromatics, <b>isoclinics</b> and isopachics, we modeled in the present paper the phase-shifting photoelastic measurement in the presence of speckle noise through the calculation of the complex amplitudes in a Mach-Zender interferometer combined with a circular polariscope and made denoising of simulated and experimental fringe patterns.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{two-dimensional}} photoelastic stress analyses on circular and oval {{toroidal magnetic field}} coils for fusion reactors were made. The circumferential variation of the coil's magnetic force was simulated by applying different pressures to sixteen segmented regions of the inner surface of the models.
