5|$|Tornado myths are <b>incorrect</b> {{beliefs about}} tornadoes, {{which can be}} {{attributed}} to many factors, including stories and news reports told by people unfamiliar with tornadoes, sensationalism by news media, and the presentation of <b>incorrect</b> information in popular entertainment. Common myths cover various aspects of the tornado, and include ideas about tornado safety, the minimization of tornado damage, and false assumptions about the size, shape, power, and path of the tornado itself.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, best linear {{unbiased}} prediction (BLUP) {{techniques used}} to estimate the genetic merit of stud cattle (for example, estimated breeding values (EBVs) and expected progeny differences (EPDs)) will be <b>incorrect</b> because they assume that no dominant genes contribute to modelled traits.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Dudley {{hypothesized}} that the excitation of neon, {{at the time a}} recently discovered noble gas, was responsible for the appearance of the aurora borealis. While this was <b>incorrect,</b> his suggestion was widely reported by the media at the time.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} reported {{that some of}} the attackers were British citizens, but the Indian government later stated that there was no evidence to confirm this. Similarly, early reports of 12 gunmen were also later shown to be <b>incorrect.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 2010, {{five months}} after the Court of Inquiry was constituted, it {{submitted}} its report with input from the NTSB and Boeing, and stated that pilot error was the cause of the accident since the flight path was <b>incorrect.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other sounds {{attributed}} to this rail, such as loud screams, may be <b>incorrect,</b> {{since they are}} like those produced by the pale-vented bush-hen (Amaurornis moluccana).|$|E
5|$|The {{multiple}} choice section is scored {{immediately after the}} exam by computer. One point is awarded for each correct answer, no points are credited or deducted for unanswered questions, and points are no longer deducted for having an <b>incorrect</b> answer.|$|E
5|$|The referee's {{decision}} in all on-pitch matters is considered final. The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later {{evidence shows that}} decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were <b>incorrect.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{principle}} distilled {{the essence}} of Einstein's objection to quantum mechanics. As a physical principle, it was shown to be <b>incorrect</b> when the Aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed Bell's theorem, which had been promulgated in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{receivers}} {{assuming that}} year 00 is a leap year (correct for year 2000) will be <b>incorrect</b> {{in the year}} 2100.|$|E
5|$|While {{many books}} and {{articles}} were written during the Turk's life about how it worked, most were inaccurate, drawing <b>incorrect</b> inferences from external observation.|$|E
5|$|Academic reviewers {{were mostly}} positive, but several raised {{concerns}} over Berger's <b>incorrect</b> use of terminology. Reviewers noted the study's importance in developing Pagan studies {{as an academic}} discipline and helping further the wider sociological investigation into new religious movements in the United States. In the years following the study's publication, Berger continued to investigate the Pagan community, focusing her interest on the popularity of Wicca among teenagers.|$|E
5|$|After a {{long and}} zealously pious life, Cædmon died like a saint: {{receiving}} a premonition of death, he asked to be moved to the abbey's hospice for the terminally ill where, having gathered his friends around him, he died after receiving the Holy Eucharist, just before nocturns. Although he is often listed as a saint, this is not confirmed by Bede and it has recently been argued that such assertions are <b>incorrect.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{selecting}} the landing site for Apollo 16, sampling the Descartes and Cayley formations, two geologic {{units of the}} lunar highlands, was determined by mission planners {{to be the primary}} sampling interest of the mission. It was these formations that the scientific community widely suspected were formed by lunar volcanism, but this hypothesis was proven <b>incorrect</b> by the composition of lunar samples from the mission.|$|E
5|$|At that time, many in Britain {{worried that}} coal {{reserves}} were rapidly dwindling, {{but some experts}} opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption. Jevons argued that this view was <b>incorrect,</b> as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal. Hence, improving technology would tend to increase {{the rate at which}} England's coal deposits were being depleted, and could not be relied upon to solve the problem.|$|E
5|$|Atoms {{are small}} enough that {{attempting}} to predict their behavior using classical physics – {{as if they}} were billiard balls, for example – gives noticeably <b>incorrect</b> predictions due to quantum effects. Through the development of physics, atomic models have incorporated quantum principles to better explain and predict the behavior.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1998 {{release of}} Tony Fletcher's Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon, Moon's {{date of birth}} was presumed to be 23 August 1947. This {{erroneous}} date appeared in several otherwise-reliable sources, including the Townshend-authorised biography Before I Get Old: The Story of The Who. The <b>incorrect</b> date had been supplied by Moon in interviews before it was corrected by Fletcher to 1946.|$|E
5|$|Before the flyby of Voyager 2, astronomers {{suspected}} that Triton might have liquid nitrogen seas and a nitrogen/methane atmosphere with a density {{as much as}} 30% that of Earth. Like the famous overestimates of the atmospheric density of Mars, this proved <b>incorrect.</b> As with Mars, a denser atmosphere is postulated for its early history.|$|E
5|$|Cartman is {{considered}} to be the most popular character on South Park. Parker and Stone state that he is their favorite character, and the one with whom they most identify. South Park has received both praise and criticism for Cartman's politically <b>incorrect</b> behavior. Prominent publications and television channels have included Cartman on their lists {{as one of the most}} iconic television and cartoon characters of all time.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosauroides {{has been}} {{considered}} an indeterminate dromaeosaur by some scientists. Bonde responded that since the teeth {{differ from those of}} other dromaeosaurs from the Early Cretaceous (and later members of the group, including Dromaeosaurus), it should be considered valid. He also said that these scientists had provided <b>incorrect</b> information about the location, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were no different from those of other tooth-based taxa.|$|E
5|$|Each round {{began with}} a toss-up {{physical}} challenge in which both teams competed, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host began asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct answer earned a monetary award, and allowed the team to maintain control, while an <b>incorrect</b> answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turned control over to the opponents. However, the team could dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents could double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control was challenged to a double dare, they had to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. An <b>incorrect</b> answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awarded both control and the appropriate {{amount of money to}} the team that issued it. The second round played the same as the first, with question values doubled. On Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, a question was initially worth $10. On Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000, a question was initially worth $25.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Debra's {{development}} {{near the}} coast was unusual, complicating forecasting {{in addition to}} its rapid intensification and abnormal direction. The lack of ship reports and <b>incorrect</b> information received from those that were received further complicated Debra's forecasts. However, due to its formation close to the coast, Debra had inadequate time to cause a greater storm surge. Debra's floods accounted for most of the month's rainfall.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, {{an amateur}} American {{mathematician}} attempted {{to persuade the}} Indiana legislature to pass the Indiana Pi Bill, which described a method to square the circle and contained text that implied various <b>incorrect</b> values for , including 3.2. The bill is notorious {{as an attempt to}} establish a value of scientific constant by legislative fiat. The bill was passed by the Indiana House of Representatives, but rejected by the Senate, meaning it did not become a law.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Danish Bacon and Meat Council {{commissioned}} {{research at}} Leeds University into what features make a perfect bacon butty (the researchers refused {{to use the}} term sandwich deeming this to be <b>incorrect</b> terminology). Among the findings were that texture and crispiness of the bacon were just as important as taste.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Minnesota Majority, a {{conservative}} watchdog group, {{conducted a study}} in which they flagged 2,803 voters for examination, including some 1,359 they suspected were ineligible convicted felons in the largely Democratic Minneapolis–St. Paul area who voted illegally in the Senate race. Subsequent investigations of Minnesota Majority's claims by election officials found that many of their allegations were <b>incorrect.</b>|$|E
5|$|In cladistics, a homoplasy is a trait {{shared by}} two or more taxa for any reason other than that they share a common ancestry. Taxa which do share ancestry {{are part of the}} same clade; cladistics seeks to arrange them {{according}} to their degree of relatedness to describe their phylogeny. Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, {{from the point of view}} of cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an <b>incorrect</b> analysis.|$|E
5|$|In the past, it {{was thought}} that {{consumption}} of protein even at normal levels increased the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This {{has been shown to be}} <b>incorrect.</b> Furthermore, many people with chronic liver disease are malnourished and require adequate protein to maintain a stable body weight. A diet with adequate protein and energy is therefore recommended.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventh}} episode, Paul Kallipolitis is murdered {{in his home}} by Andrew Veniamin, and in the {{following}} episode, Victor Peirce is murdered outside of his home. While both murders occurred in 2002, the series timeline is <b>incorrect,</b> as Peirce was murdered on 1 May, and Kallipolitis was murdered on 15 October.|$|E
5|$|<b>Incorrect</b> {{unloading}} sequences and ballasting {{which resulted}} in the buoyancy of the hull becoming uneven and the hull therefore strained: Lack of crew training or knowing malpractice were possible explanations. Total was held largely to blame for this. However, given that all the personnel involved in the unloading had died in the explosion, it was difficult to be certain as to what had happened.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the attribution to book three was simply <b>incorrect,</b> and Atalante's Ehoie came within the family of Athamas in books one or two. Another possibility is that she was introduced in the context of her mother's family. Her identity in the Catalogue is unknown, but this hypothesis could allow for Atalanta to appear within the Inachid stemma, following the Danae-Ehoie within the extended family of Belus.|$|E
5|$|It seems {{curious that}} a text so {{obviously}} written {{with the expectation}} that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft. Treharne has taken this as suggesting that it is not only modern readers who have found the work tedious (Treharne 2000, p.273). Orm, however, says in the preface that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or <b>incorrect</b> (quoted in Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.175–76).|$|E
5|$|Lyons' admissions {{during the}} first {{interview}} were not very detailed, {{and many of the}} details provided did not match the evidence. Lyons gave <b>incorrect</b> information about the precise location of the killings and about the number of weapons used. During the interview, he was confused about {{the number of people that}} had been killed, and he thought that the women were awake, and moving about the house at the time, which conflicted with the forensic evidence.|$|E
5|$|McDonald {{was later}} {{appointed}} by Washington {{to serve as}} a lieutenant colonel in command of Virginia revolutionary militia forces during the American Revolutionary War. He also served on various revolutionary committees throughout the war. McDonald died on August 19, 1778, at his home Glengarry near Winchester after receiving an <b>incorrect</b> dosage of the medication potassium antimonyl tartrate.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{proponents of}} social trinitarianism often {{claim to have}} been {{influenced}} by the Cappadocians' dynamic picture of the Trinity. However, it would be fundamentally <b>incorrect</b> to identify Gregory as a social Trinitarian, as his theology emphasises the unity of God's will, and he clearly believes that the identities of the Trinity are the three persons, not the relations between them.|$|E
5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{before the storm}} struck. This was later determined to be because of missing atmospheric sounding data, {{as well as an}} <b>incorrect</b> assessment of the height of the tropopause, which led to an underestimation of the strength of the thunderstorm which produced the tornado. Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} episode of Jeopardy! season 31, which aired on September 15, 2014, Jeopardy! {{champion}} Elizabeth Williams echoed Cliff Clavin's answer in her response to the Final Jeopardy clue. Williams's $600 wager combined with her opponents' <b>incorrect</b> responses allowed Williams to triumph that day, nonetheless.|$|E
