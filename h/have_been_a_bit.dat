500|$|Sheridan's {{performance}} was generally well received. Entertainment Weekly’s Ken Tucker {{wrote that the}} best acting came from Sheridan, who gave the character a [...] "grim intensity". He commented that Sheridan had [...] "leading-man looks" [...] with the hair of a [...] "dissolute heavy metal star", making him [...] "unsettling" [...] even when not wearing makeup that makes {{him look like a}} devil. Douglas E. Winter of Fangoria magazine believed that Sheridan might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> young and [...] "zany" [...] for the part, but gave a credible performance; he said that Sheridan attacked the role [...] "with the swagger of Elvis, the sway of David Koresh and as much craziness as your heart desires (and network TV allows)".|$|E
500|$|Lana was {{introduced}} as Neighbours first lesbian character. Neval revealed that while Lana would fuel a storyline for established character Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh), she would also go through her own journey. A representative from Grundy Television {{explained that the}} storyline would be [...] "a relationship story of a close female friendship, made compelling by {{the complexity of the}} feelings involved." [...] The representative believed the storyline would [...] "strike a chord" [...] with teenage viewers, who could relate to Sky and Lana's feelings. Scriptwriter Helen MacWhirter also stated that Lana's story is [...] "multi-faceted", saying, [...] "On one level it's about a young girl coming to terms with her sexuality, which on its own might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> boring and gratuitous, but it also brought into play other story strands which added depth and dimension." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{noted that}} there was a greater focus on Moore's {{keyboards}} than Matheos' guitar riffs. Blogcritics said that [...] "Free focuses a lot on the keyboards and programming of Kevin Moore", although Matheos' [...] "heavy guitar riffs, while not as frequent on this disc, have an even harder edge. They have an energy, and urgency, and serious metal crunch to them that will make any rocker sit up and pay attention." [...] Chad Bower of About.com noted that Free [...] "isn't one of those metal albums that hypes you up and makes you want to break stuff. It's one where you have to sit back, throw on the headphones, and appreciate the complexity and musicianship." [...] Olav Björnsen of Prog4you.com stated that [...] "layers upon layers of electronic sounds, that fill out the soundscapes of the songs, create nuances and subtle moods as well as walls of sound and tension." [...] He said that Matheos used acoustic and electric guitars [...] "to fill out the soundscapes even more, and is at the most effective when playing the acoustic guitar, giving life and warmth to songs that would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> cold sounding without that input." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film 2.5 out of 4, saying [...] "This isn't a great heist movie {{for a lot}} of reasons, {{beginning}} with the stupidity of its heist plan and the impossibility of these characters ever being successful at anything more complex than standing in line," [...] but appreciated that the comedy did not [...] "go heavy on the excremental, the masturbatory and symphonies of four-letter words", calling it [...] "funny in an innocent screwball kind of way." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum called the film [...] "overblinged, eye-catching, and essentially tacky," [...] and praised Murphy, saying [...] "when Murphy is on screen, his comedic vigor... gooses the movie's energy level... but whenever Murphy wanders off, the movie's pulse rate drops. Tower Heist is in effect two movies: One belongs to Murphy, the other {{to the rest of the}} cast." [...] Time Out Londons Trevor Johnston said that [...] "though it's hard to get excited by this amiable potboiler, Tower Heist is so at home with its limitations it's equally hard to dislike," [...] but criticized the finale [...] "which might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more tense had we been able to take it remotely seriously." [...] Conversely, Time Out New Yorks David Fear gave it 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "one nail-biting moment and some much-missed Murphy mouthiness won't keep you from feeling like you're the one being ripped off." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Guilty" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by most television commentators, who praised its storylines. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a complimentary review. He {{claimed that the}} episode [...] "effectively ramped up the tension". Fowler thought that it [...] "might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too much to accept that poor Rex had to suffer through yet another near-death ordeal", and that [...] "the episode itself was able to provide genuine thrills mixed with some incredible moments of tenderness". Fowler noted that Michael fully took [...] "advantage of his unique, tragic, situation by having him purposefully use one world {{as a source of}} information to help him solve a case". Stating that the episode had [...] "top-tier entertainment", Fowler concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "9 out of 10", classifying it as [...] "great". Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic mainly enjoyed this episode. McHatton claimed that Rex's current behaviour and thoughts are [...] "understandable" [...] and [...] "heart-renching". He concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "4.7 out of 5" [...] score. Caroline Preece from Den of Geek gave praise in the episode. He thought the episode was [...] "built around a gripping premise". Preece wrote that the series is [...] "still very odd" [...] after the episode. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall noted many parts of the episode. Sepinwall stated that there was a [...] "notable change in feel or style" [...] from other episodes, because of different writers for the episode. He noted that [...] "the idea of the loved one getting kidnapped feels like a very big card to play this early", and that [...] "it does fit in with the theme of the show". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave less praise and enjoyment in the episode. In his [...] "B-" [...] review, he noted that the [...] "premise has been established". He stated that it is [...] "a clever device". He argued that the [...] "plotting isn't helping" [...] the episode. The Voice of TV's Mary Powers gave the episode a [...] "A-" [...] grade. She called the episode [...] "fabulous". Carl Cortez from Assignment X gave much praise in the episode. He called it a [...] "twisty/turny adventure". Cortez claimed that it [...] "feels too early and convenient" [...] for Rex to get kidnapped.|$|E
2500|$|Wall's {{approach}} to business has sometimes caused conflict. He reportedly admitted, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> impulsive {{at times and}} I do {{want to be more}} respectful of my fellow man".

According to an anecdote reported in The Vancouver Sun, in 2002 he gave a [...] Rolls Royce convertible to a friend to save him from having to walk to a meeting.|$|E

The signal in Albuquerque <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> weak there during daytime hours and was even harder (but not impossible) to hear at night due to its transmitter being located near Belen about 40 miles south of Albuquerque and using low levels of power.

2500|$|Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly {{compared}} Peter Pan to King Joffrey from Game of Thrones, saying [...] "It's a shame Storybrooke doesn't get HBO.

[...] Not all reviews were as positive, however; Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- rating, signaling mixed reviews. She said [...] "On the way to Neverland, unfortunately, OUAT's season-three premiere gets immediately bogged down in family issues, an area where these Storybrookers have loads of problems." ...|$|E

According to the authors of the book,Yesterday's Tomorrows: Past Visions of the American Future, Teague {{was one of the people}} that [...] "helped to transport us into the future." [...] While serving as the chief stylist, Teague was called by Popular Mechanics to predict the design trends for automobiles in the 1960s. Together with Brooks Stevens, Teague presented ideas about future cars and vehicle technologies at the 1963 SAE congress in Detroit. Teague, [...] "who is generally considered to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a maverick" [...] predicted an evolutionary process for automobiles that turned out to be right. Teague foretold improvements in conventional gasoline engines, while cars [...] "would have greater variety of style now that glass could be shaped, and better suspension systems" [...] In contrast to Stevens, Teague believed that the automobiles of 1970 would still be built to provide basic transportation, and not be [...] "a home on wheels" [...] powered by an advanced power plant “the size of a breadbox.” ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} issue in Blind Source Separation (BSS) {{is how to}} measure the similarity between a true source and its estimate. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> simple but not completely trivial topic that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> overlooked in the literature. Special problems arise when the source signals are sparse and the BSS problem is degenerate (i. e. we have more sources than observed mixtures). In this paper we review the most popular distortion measures that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{used to assess the}} performance of different BSS algorithms. We show that the common distortion measures are not suitable for the degenerate blind separation of sparse sources. Finally we propose a class of alternative distortion measures for sparse sources...|$|R
