25|$|Three subtypes of CDG I (a,b,d) {{can cause}} {{congenital}} <b>hyperinsulinism</b> with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in infancy.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} {{congenital}} <b>hyperinsulinism</b> {{has been linked}} to anomalies in nine different genes. The diffuse form of this condition is inherited via the autosomal recessive manner(though sometimes in autosomal dominant).|$|E
25|$|As of 2004, 5 {{mutations}} {{have been}} found to enhance insulin secretion. Heterozygosity for gain of function mutations reduces the threshold glucose that triggers insulin release. This creates hypoglycemia of varying patterns, including transient or persistent congenital <b>hyperinsulinism,</b> or fasting or reactive hypoglycemia appearing at an older age.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} the {{mechanism}} of congenital <b>hyperinsulinism</b> one sees that channel trafficking requires KATP channels need the shielding of ER retention signal.E282K prevents the KATP channel surface expression, the C-terminus (SUR1 subunit) is needed in KATP channel mechanism.R1215Q mutations (ABCC8 gene) affect ADP gating which in turn inhibits KATP channel.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{people who}} do not have {{diabetes}} may periodically have hypoglycemic symptoms but may also have a much higher rate of false positives to true, and a meter is not accurate enough to base a diagnosis of hypoglycemia upon. A meter can occasionally be useful in the monitoring of severe types of hypoglycemia (e.g., congenital <b>hyperinsulinism)</b> to ensure that the average glucose when fasting remains above 70mg/dl (3.9mmol/l).|$|E
25|$|Diagnostic efforts then {{shift to}} {{determining}} the type- elevated ammonia levels or abnormal organic acids can indicate specific, rare types. Intrauterine growth retardation and other perinatal problems raise {{the possibility of}} transience, while large birthweight suggests {{one of the more}} persistent conditions. Genetic screening is now available within a useful time frame for some of the specific conditions.It is worthwhile to identify the minority of severe cases with focal forms of <b>hyperinsulinism</b> because these can be completely cured by partial pancreatectomy. A variety of pre-operative diagnostic procedures have been investigated but none has been established as infallibly reliable. Positron emission tomography is becoming the most useful imaging technique.|$|E
25|$|Familial <b>hyperinsulinism,</b> {{linked to}} {{mutations}} in GLUD1, {{is characterized by}} hypoglycemia that ranges from severe neonatal-onset, difficult-to-manage disease to childhood-onset disease with mild symptoms and difficult-to-diagnose hypoglycemia. Neonatal-onset disease manifests within hours to two days after birth. Childhood-onset disease manifests during the first months or years of life. In the newborn period, presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, including seizures, hypotonia, poor feeding, and apnea. In severe cases, serum glucose concentrations are typically extremely low and thus easily recognized, whereas in milder cases, variable and mild hypoglycemia may make the diagnosis more difficult. Even within the same family, disease manifestations can range from mild to severe. Individuals with autosomal recessive familial <b>hyperinsulinism,</b> caused by mutations in either ABCC8 or KCNJ11 (FHI-KATP), tend to be large for gestational age and usually present with severe refractory hypoglycemia in the first 48 hours of life; affected infants usually respond only partially to diet or medical management (i.e., diazoxide therapy) and thus may require pancreatic resection. Individuals with autosomal dominant FHI-KATP tend to be appropriate for gestational age at birth, to present at approximately age one year (range: 2 days - 30 years), and to respond to diet and diazoxide therapy. Exceptions to both of these generalities have been reported. FHI-GCK, caused by mutations in GCK, may be much milder than FHI-KATP; however, some persons have severe, diazoxide-unresponsive hypoglycemia. FHI-HADH, caused by mutations in HADH, tends to be relatively mild, although severe cases have been reported. Individuals with FHI-HNF4A, caused by mutations in HNF4A, are typically born large for gestational age and have mild features that respond to diazoxide treatment. FHI-UCP2, caused by mutations in UCP2, is a rare cause of diazoxide-responsive FH1. Hyperammonemia/hyperinsulinism (HA/HI) is associated with mild-to-moderate hyperammonemia and with relatively mild, late-onset hypoglycemia; most but not all affected individuals have mutations in GLUD1.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{recognition}} of PanNETs, the possibility of cancer of the islet cells was initially suggested in 1888. The first case of <b>hyperinsulinism</b> due to a tumor of this type was reported in 1927. Recognition of a non-insulin-secreting type of PanNET is generally ascribed to the American surgeons, [...] R.M. Zollinger and E.H. Ellison, who gave their names to Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, after postulating {{the existence of a}} gastrin-secreting pancreatic tumor in a report of two cases of unusually severe peptic ulcers published in 1955. In 2010, the WHO recommended that PanNETs be referred to as [...] "neuroendocrine" [...] rather than [...] "endocrine" [...] tumors.|$|E

2500|$|Congenital <b>hyperinsulinism</b> is {{a medical}} term {{referring}} {{to a variety of}} congenital disorders in which hypoglycemia is caused by excessive insulin secretion.

2500|$|Hypoglycemia {{in early}} infancy can cause jitteriness, lethargy, unresponsiveness, or seizures. The most severe forms may cause macrosomia in utero, {{producing}} a large birth weight, {{often accompanied by}} abnormality of the pancreas. Milder hypoglycemia in infancy causes hunger every few hours, with increasing jitteriness or lethargy.

2500|$|GLUD1 catalyses the {{oxidative}} deamination of Glu to 2-oxoglutarate {{and free}} NH4+ using either NAD+ or NADP+ as a co-factor. The reaction occurs with {{the transfer of}} a hydride ion from Glu's Cα to NAD(P)+, thereby forming 2-iminoglutarate, which is hydrolyzed to 2-oxoglutarate and NH4+. The reaction's equilibrium under standard circumstances greatly favors Glu formation over NH4+ (Go' ~ 30 kJ.mol-1) formation. For this reason, {{it was thought that}} the enzyme {{played an important role in}} ammonia detoxification, because since high [...] are toxic, this equilibrium position would be physiologically important; it would help to maintain low [...] However, in individuals with a certain form of hyperammonemia resulting from a form of <b>hyperinsulinism,</b> the enzyme's activity is increased due to decreased GTP sensitivy, a negative regulator.

50|$|Insulin levels above 3 μU/mL are {{inappropriate}} when the glucose level is below 50 mg/dL (2.8 mM), and may indicate <b>hyperinsulinism</b> {{as the cause}} of the hypoglycemia. The treatment of this form of <b>hyperinsulinism</b> depends on the cause and the severity of the <b>hyperinsulinism,</b> and may include surgical removal of the source of insulin, or a drug such as diazoxide or octreotide that reduces insulin secretion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperinsulinism</b> due {{to diffuse}} overactivity of beta cells, {{such as in}} many of the forms of {{congenital}} <b>hyperinsulinism,</b> and more rarely in adults, can often be treated with diazoxide or a somatostatin analog called octreotide. Diazoxide is given by mouth, octreotide by injection or continuous subcutaneous pump infusion. When congenital <b>hyperinsulinism</b> is due to focal defects of the insulin-secretion mechanism, surgical removal of that part of the pancreas may cure the problem. In more severe cases of persistent congenital <b>hyperinsulinism</b> unresponsive to drugs, a near-total pancreatectomy may be needed to prevent continuing hypoglycemia. Even after pancreatectomy, continuous glucose may be needed in the form of gastric infusion of formula or dextrose.|$|E
50|$|Several {{treatments}} {{are used for}} hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, depending on the exact form and severity. Some forms of congenital <b>hyperinsulinism</b> respond to diazoxide or octreotide. Surgical removal of the overactive part of the pancreas is curative with minimal risk when <b>hyperinsulinism</b> is focal or due to a benign insulin-producing tumor of the pancreas. When congenital <b>hyperinsulinism</b> is diffuse and refractory to medications, near-total pancreatectomy may be the treatment of last resort, but in this condition is less consistently effective and fraught with more complications.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hyperinsulinism</b> {{may also}} refer to forms of {{hypoglycemia}} caused by excessive insulin secretion.

Some of those that occur in infants and young children are termed congenital <b>hyperinsulinism.</b> In adults, severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is often due to an insulinoma, an insulin-secreting tumor of the pancreas.|$|E
