40|$|In {{the paper}} is {{described}} an investigation carried out to determine the elastic distribution of stress in rings and flanges using the <b>frozen</b> <b>stress</b> photoelastic <b>method.</b> Preliminary tests on rings and flanges showed linear load-residual deflection relationships over the main test ranges. A series of tests was performed on plain rings of different thicknesses loaded uniformly round the inner edge and round a diameter corresponding to the pitch circle. Three series of tests, namely to investigate the influence of flange thickness, number of bolt holes and length of hub, were performed on model flanges subjected to simulated bolt loading. A further series of tests was performed on flanges integral with a short length of pipe and subjected to internal pressure. The complete distributions of tangential and radial contour stresses were obtained over the whole free surface of the rings and over the free surface at both types of radial section of symmetry in the flanges. The axial deflections were also measured. The test results are compared with those computed from the various theoretical solutions...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} {{in order to develop}} test methods and procedures for measuring the variation of the stress intensity factor through the thickness in bimaterial specimens containing cracks within and parallel to the bond line using the <b>frozen</b> <b>stress</b> photoelastic <b>method.</b> Since <b>stress</b> freezing materials are incompressible above critical temperature, and since thick plates are to be employed which tend to produce a state of plane strain near the crack tip, the interface near tip fracture equations reduce to the classic form for homogeneous materials. Moreover, zero thickness interfaces do not exist when materials are bonded together. It was decided early on that it would be important to insure a uniform straight and accurate crack tip region through the thickness of the body to reduce scatter in the SIF distribution through the thickness. It was also observed that rubberlike materials which were desired to be modeled exhibited significant tip blunting prior to crack extension and that some blunting of the tip would provide a more realistic model. It should be noted that, in normal stress freezing photoelastic work, it is considered good practice to avoid utilizing data near bond lines in photoelastic models due to the bond line stresses which inevitably develop when two parts are bonded together. Thus, the present study involves certain exploratory aspects in deviating from standard practice in stress freezing work. With the above ideas in mind, several different test methods were investigated and are described in the following sections and appendices. The geometry selected for the program was a thick, edge cracked specimen containing a bond line...|$|R

However, most fatigue assessments {{in the field}} of civil engineering are mainly based on nominal stress or hot spot stress theories, which has the disadvantage of dependence on the meshing styles and massive curves selected. To address this problem, in this paper, the equivalent structural <b>stress</b> <b>method</b> with advantages of mesh-insensitive quality and capability of unifying different stress-life curves (S-N curves) into one is introduced to the wind-induced fatigue assessment of a large-scale complicated high-rise steel structure.

Fatigue life assessments using equivalent structural <b>stress</b> <b>method,</b> hot spot <b>stress</b> <b>method</b> and nominal <b>stress</b> <b>method</b> are performed, and the results are verified and comparisons are made. The mesh-insensitive quality is also verified. The results show that the lateral weld toe of the butt weld connecting the beam flange plate and the column is the location where fatigue damage most likely happens.

40|$|Abstract. The stress {{analysis}} for a model with initial stresses, which we term a residual stress model, is performed by digital photoelasticity. The stresses applied on the residual stress model are obtained by analyzing both the initial stresses {{and the resultant}} <b>stresses.</b> The <b>method</b> used for analyzing the stresses applies the principle of superposition of the stress to photoelasticity, which is a well-known technique {{in the field of}} elasticity. In the digital photoelasticity technique used, the principal stress direction and the relative phase retardation are analyzed by photoelastic techniques using linearly polarized light. This technique overcomes the phase difference error associated with a quarter-wave plate by employing incident light at three different wavelengths, and using an unwrapping technique that allows and to be determined using the arctangent function. A residual stress model produced by a disk containing <b>frozen</b> <b>stresses</b> that was subjected to a diametral compressive load at an angle of 31 was used to experimentally test this method.

Fatigue {{strength}} assessments {{with two}} types of load carrying fillet weldment under out-of-plane bending load {{have been carried out}} by using both hot spot stress and structural <b>stress</b> <b>methods.</b> Basis for the derivation of structural <b>stress</b> <b>method</b> is discussed in detail.

40|$|Local fatigue {{assessment}} methods like the structural hot spot stress and effective notch <b>stress</b> <b>methods</b> {{as defined by}} the International Institute of Welding are widely used by design engineers and researchers to assess the fatigue strength of welded components. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of published data for welded joints which had been improved using high frequency mechanical impact (HFMI) treatment. All of the published data for HFMI-treated welds are presented in terms of nominal stress. The goal of the current paper is to establish local {{fatigue assessment}} procedures for improved fillet welds. In total, 160 published experimental results for longitudinal and cruciform welds subjected to R = 0. 1 axial loading are evaluated. Local stress quantities for each joint were assessed based on the finite element analyses and reported nominal stress values. A correction procedure for yield strength that was previously verified for nominal stress-based fatigue assessment is also applied to the local <b>stress</b> <b>methods</b> studied in this paper. For both the structural hot spot stress and effective notch <b>stress</b> <b>methods,</b> sets of characteristic fatigue strength curves as functions of yield strength are proposed and verified. The structural hot spot <b>stress</b> <b>method</b> includes one set of fatigue strength curves for load-carrying welds and a second set for non-load carrying welds.

Recently, due to the strategies for minimizing the fuel consumption and vehicle emissions, more and more applications of lightweight materials, such as aluminum (Al) alloys, are employed in spot-welded joints. Hence, a universal and simple fatigue life prediction method is needed for conventional steel spot-welded joints as well as mixed materials spot-welded joints. In this study, a new notch stress approach is developed for fatigue life evaluation of the spot-welded joint. The idea of this method originates from Rupp’s structural <b>stress</b> <b>method,</b> which has been successfully used in automotive industry.
