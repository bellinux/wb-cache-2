50|$|The Sungri Motor Plant {{was founded}} in November 1950 as the Tokchon Motor Plant (덕천자동차공장). It {{produced}} its first vehicle, a Sungri-58 truck, in 1958. In 1975, the plant was renamed Sungri Motor Plant (sungri meaning victory in Korean). In 1980, annual production was reported {{by the government to}} be 20,000 units per year, however the rate was more likely between 6,000 and 7,000 units per year. In 1996 production was crippled due to the country's economic difficulties, with approximately 150 units produced. The Sungri ZR 5000 Giant <b>Dumping</b> <b>Truck,</b> is powered by a W shaped 4 cylinder engine producing 1000 hp, and a claimed speed of 200 km/h.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to reduce idle times of mining trucks and shovels in an open-pit coal mine. A {{heuristic}} algorithm for making dispatching decisions in conditions of dynamic allocation of trucks is developed. Priority parameters for choosing the shovel after the end-of-truck unloading are introduced. Also, an algorithm for searching for the optimal priority parameters to satisfy the required efficiency criterion is developed. This algorithm is based on a simulation model of a shovel-truck system. The proposed approach is applicable in terms of the group of shovels with a common dump point in various open-pit coal mines. The importance of this work {{lies in the fact that}} the proposed model takes into account the random factors related with the duration of loading and <b>dumping,</b> <b>truck</b> movement, repair of shovels and haul trucks, as well as the duration of periods between repairs. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{differential}} {{control strategy}} based on equal slip rates is introduced {{to improve the}} steering stability of an all-wheelelectric-drive underground articulated <b>dumping</b> <b>truck.</b> Steering kinematic and dynamic models of the truck are derived to describe the movement relationship and force of the driving wheels. In consideration {{of the difficulty of}} obtaining the absolute velocity for an all-wheel-drive truck, an acceleration sensor was set on a test truck, and a kalman filter was applied to obtain the actual value for the truck body. Simulation results for an equal-slip control strategy were compared with experimental results for an equal-torque control strategy. In the simulation, the four-wheel slip rate was 0. 08 and the steering system of the truck was stable. The results verify that the equal-slip control strategy makes better use of the ground adhesion coefficient, is able to reasonably distribute drive power, notably reduces tire wear, and improves the use of driving power...|$|E
40|$|The {{earth-moving}} {{machines are}} used in many industries such as mining, construction,forestry, agriculture and cleaning. In underground mines, wheel loadersor LHD machines are used to move the blasted rock to a dumping site oronto a dumper truck. In presence of a nearby <b>dumping</b> <b>truck,</b> the wheel loaderis said to be operating in a short loading cycle. This research work concernswith moving of fragmented rock by a wheel loader in a short loading cycle. Three decades of research efforts in automation for bucket loading operationhas not yet yielded in any commercial fully autonomous system for this applicationdue {{to the complexity of}} bucket-environment interactions. In this report,the challenges in automation and remote-operation of earth-moving machineshave been highlighted. A survey in different areas of research within the scopeof the project is conducted and knowledge gaps have been identified to give thedirection to future work. A plan of actions is made to conduct the proposedresearch starting from a basic remote control setup to a more advanced assistedremote control operation for a wheel loader in short loading cycle.

The next version, an articulated <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> driven by a Scania diesel engine, D20, was also finished in 1970. The first prototypes were built in Molde, but then the company moved to Varhol by Elnesvågen in Fræna municipality, where a new factory was built. About the same time Moxy acquired Gjøvik based company Øveraasen Motorfabrikk & Mekaniske Verksted, which provided Moxy with useful engineering technology.|$|R

From our analysis, we proposed methods based on inverse valley feature of mechanical arm and spatial-temporal reasoning for hydraulic excavator detection. In addition, we explored <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> detection strategies that combine structured component projection with the spatial relationship. Experiments on real-monitoring sites demonstrated the promising performance of our system...|$|R
