40|$|Using {{a direct}} {{enrichment}} and screening procedure, mutants of Escherichia coli have been isolated in which recombination frequencies for several intragenic Hfr x F- crosses are significantly higher (twofold to sixfold) {{than in the}} parental strains. These hyper-recombination mutations comprised five new mutS- and one new mutL- allele. Together with other known mut - alleles, they were analyzed for effects on intragenic recombination using several types of crosses. Hyper-recombination was found for mutS -, mutL-, mutH (= mutR) - and mutU (=uvrD) -, with the largest effects seen for certain alleles of uvrD; these resulted in over 20 -fold excesses in recombinant production for Hfr x F- crosses and F'-chromosome <b>homogenotization.</b> Spontaneous mutator ability was not always correlated with degree of hyper-recombination...|$|E
40|$|The Rhizobium phaseoli recA gene {{has been}} cloned by {{interspecific}} complementation of the Fec phenotype of bacteriophage lambda. The cloned gene restored the recombination proficiency and conferred resistance to DNA-damaging agents (methyl methanesulfonate and nitrofurantoin) to an Escherichia coli recA mutant. The direction of transcription and the localization of the recA gene {{were determined by}} mutagenesis with phage MudIIPR 13 and heterologous hybridization with an E. coli recA probe. An R. phaseoli recA::Spcr mutation was introduced in two R. phaseoli strains by <b>homogenotization.</b> The R. phaseoli recA mutants were more sensitive to DNA-damaging agents and exhibited a 100 -fold reduction in recombination frequency as compared with their parental strains. A deletion of the symbiotic plasmid abolishing nodulation was found at high frequency (10 (- 2)) in R. phaseoli CNF 42. This event was recA dependent. In R. phaseoli CFN 285, two events of symbiotic instability were found at high frequency (10 (- 3]: one was a deletion in the symbiotic plasmid, {{and the other was}} the loss of whole symbiotic plasmid. In the CFN 285 recA::Spcr mutant, only the loss of the symbiotic plasmid was observed...|$|E
40|$|NIPP 1 (nuclear {{inhibitor}} {{of protein}} phosphatase 1) is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear scaffold protein {{that has been}} implicated in both transcription and RNA processing. Among its protein ligands are a protein kinase, a protein phosphatase, two splicing factors, and a transcriptional regulator, and the binding of these proteins to NIPP 1 is tightly regulated by phosphorylation. To study the function of NIPP 1 in vivo, we have used homologous recombination to generate mice that are deficient in NIPP 1. NIPP 1 (-/+) mice developed normally. However, NIPP 1 (-/-) embryos showed severely retarded growth at embryonic day 6. 5 (E 6. 5) and were resorbed by E 8. 5. This early embryonic lethality {{was not associated with}} increased apoptosis but correlated with impaired cell proliferation. Blastocyst outgrowth experiments and the RNA interference-mediated knockdown of NIPP 1 in cultured cells also revealed an essential role for NIPP 1 in cell proliferation. In further agreement with this function, no viable NIPP 1 (-/-) cell lines were obtained by derivation of embryonic stem (ES) cells from blastocysts of NIPP 1 (-/+) intercrosses or by forced <b>homogenotization</b> of heterozygous ES cells at high concentrations of Geneticin. We conclude that NIPP 1 is indispensable for early embryonic development and cell proliferation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Transposon Tn 5 {{mutagenesis}} {{was used}} to isolate mutants of Rhodospirillum rubrum which lack uptake hydrogenase (Hup) activity. Three Tn 5 insertions mapped at different positions within the same 13 -kb EcoRI fragment (fragment E 1). Hybridization experiments revealed homology to the structural hydrogenase genes hupSLM from Rhodobacter capsulatus and hupSL from Bradyrhizobium japonicum in a 3. 8 -kb EcoRI-ClaI subfragment of fragment E 1. It is suggested that this region contains {{at least some of}} the structural genes encoding the nickel-dependent uptake hydrogenase of R. rubrum. At a distance of about 4. 5 kb from the fragment homologous to hupSLM, a region with homology to a DNA fragment carrying hypDE and hoxXA from B. japonicum was identified. Stable insertion and deletion mutations were generated in vitro and introduced into R. rubrum by <b>homogenotization.</b> In comparison with the wild type, the resulting hup mutants showed increased nitrogenase-dependent H 2 photoproduction. However, a mutation in a structural hup gene did not result in maximum H 2 production rates, indicating that the capacity to recycle H 2 was not completely lost. Highest H 2 production rates were obtained with a mutant carrying an insertion in a nonstructural hup-specific sequence and with a deletion mutant affected in both structural and nonstructural hup genes. Thus, besides the known Hup activity, a second, previously unknown Hup activity seems to be involved in H 2 recycling. A single regulatory or accessory gene might be responsible for both enzymes. In contrast to the nickel-dependent uptake hydrogenase, the second Hup activity seems to be resistant to the metal chelator EDTA...|$|E
