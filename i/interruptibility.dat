40|$|Abstract—Assessing the {{presence}} and availability of a remote colleague is key in coordination in global software development but is not easily done using existing computer-mediated chan-nels. Previous {{research has shown that}} automated estimation of <b>interruptibility</b> is feasible and can achieve a precision closer to, or even better than, human judgment. However, existing approaches to assess <b>interruptibility</b> have been designed to rely on external sensors. In this paper, we present Approximator, a system that estimates the <b>interruptibility</b> of a user based exclusively on the sensing ability of commodity laptops. Experimental results show that the information aggregated from several activity monitors (i. e., key-logger, mouse-logger, and face-detection) provide useful data, which, once combined with machine learning techniques, can automatically estimate the <b>interruptibility</b> of users with a 78 % accuracy. These early but promising results represent a starting point for designing tools with support for <b>interruptibility</b> capable of improving distributed awareness and cooperation to be used in global software development.

40|$|In {{reinforcement}} learning, agents {{learn by}} performing actions and observing their outcomes. Sometimes, {{it is desirable}} for a human operator to interrupt an agent {{in order to prevent}} dangerous situations from happening. Yet, as part of their learning process, agents may link these interruptions, that impact their reward, to specific states and deliberately avoid them. The situation is particularly challenging in a multi-agent context because agents might not only learn from their own past interruptions, but also from those of other agents. Orseau and Armstrong defined safe <b>interruptibility</b> for one learner, but their work does not naturally extend to multi-agent systems. This paper introduces dynamic safe <b>interruptibility,</b> an alternative definition more suited to decentralized learning problems, and studies this notion in two learning frameworks: joint action learners and independent learners. We give realistic sufficient conditions on the learning algorithm to enable dynamic safe <b>interruptibility</b> in the case of joint action learners, yet show that these conditions are not sufficient for independent learners. We show however that if agents can detect interruptions, it is possible to prune the observations to ensure dynamic safe <b>interruptibility</b> even for independent learners...|$|E
40|$|The {{computer}} and communication systems that office workers currently use tend to interrupt at inappropriate times or unduly demand attention {{because they have}} no way to determine when an interruption is appropriate. Sensor-based statistical models of human <b>interruptibility</b> offer a potential solution to this problem. Prior work to examine such models has primarily reported results related to social engagement, but it seems that task engagement is also important. Using an approach developed in our prior work on sensor-based statistical models of human <b>interruptibility,</b> we examine task engagement by studying programmers working on a realistic programming task. After examining many potential sensors, we implement a system to log low-level input events in a development environment. We then automatically extract features from these low-level event logs and build a statistical model of <b>interruptibility.</b> By correctly identifying situations in which programmers are non-interruptible and minimizing cases where the model incorrectly estimates that a programmer is non-interruptible, we can support a reduction in costly interruptions while still allowing systems to convey notifications in a timely manner.

40|$|Smartphone {{notifications}} {{are often}} delivered without considering user <b>interruptibility,</b> potentially causing frustration for the recipient. Therefore {{research in this}} area has concerned finding contexts where interruptions are better received. The typical convention for monitoring interruption behaviour assumes binary actions, where a response is either completed or not at all. However, in reality a user may partially respond to an interruption, such as reacting to an audible alert or exploring which application caused it. Consequently we present a multi-step model of <b>interruptibility</b> that allows assessment of both partial and complete notification responses. Through a 6 -month in-the-wild case study of 11, 346 to-do list reminders from 93 users, we find support for reducing false-negative classification of <b>interruptibility.</b> Additionally, we find that different response behaviour is correlated with different contexts and that these behaviours are predictable with similar accuracy to complete responses...|$|E

In a real-world study we collect around 70, 000 in-stances of notifications from 35 users. We group notifications according to the applications that initiated them, and the so-cial relationship between the sender and the receiver. Then, by considering both content and context information, such as the current activity of a user, we discuss the design of classi-fiers for learning the most opportune moment for the delivery of a notification carrying a specific type of information.

40|$|Notifications from mobile devices {{frequently}} prompt us with information, {{either to}} merely inform us or to elicit a reaction. This {{has led to}} increasing research interest in considering an individual’s <b>interruptibility</b> prior to issuing notifications, {{in order for them}} to be positively received. To achieve this, predictive models need to be built from previous response behaviour where the individual’s <b>interruptibility</b> is known. However, there are several degrees of freedom in achieving this, from different definitions in what it means to be interruptible and a notification to be successful, to various methods for collecting data, and building predictive models. The primary focus of this thesis is to improve upon the typical convention used for labelling <b>interruptibility,</b> an area which has had limited direct attention. This includes the proposal of a flexible framework, called the decision-on-information-gain model, which passively observes response behaviour in order to support various <b>interruptibility</b> definitions. In contrast, previous studies have largely surrounded the investigation of influential contextual factors on predicting <b>interruptibility,</b> using a broad labelling convention that relies on notifications being responded to fully and potentially a survey needing to be completed. The approach is supported through two in-the-wild studies of Android notifications, one with 11, 000 notifications across 90 users, and another with 32, 000, 000 across 3000 users. Analysis of these datasets shows that: a) responses to notifications is a decisionmaking process, whereby individuals can be reachable but not receptive to their content, supporting the premise of the approach; b) the approach is implementable on typical Android devices and capable of adapting to different notification designs and user preferences; and c) the different labels produced by the model are predictable using data sources that do not require invasive permissions or persistent background monitoring; however there are notable performance differences between different machine learning strategies for training and evaluation...|$|E

40|$|Human-machine teaming aims to meld human {{cognitive}} {{strengths and}} the unique capabilities of smart machines to create intelligent teams adaptive to rapidly changing circumstances. One {{major contributor to}} the problem of human-machine teaming is a lack of communication skills {{on the part of the}} machine. The primary objective of this research is focused on a machine’s interruption timings or when a machine should share and communicate information with human teammates within human-machine teaming interactions. Previous work addresses interruption timings from the perspective of single human, multitasking and multiple human, single task interactions. The primary aim of this dissertation is to augment this area by approaching the same problem from the perspective of a multiple human, multitasking interaction. The proposed machine is the Collaborative Communication Interruption Management System (C-CIMS) which is tasked with leveraging speech information from a human-human task and making inferences on when to interrupt with information related to an orthogonal human-machine task. This study and previous literature both suggest monitoring task boundaries and engagement as candidate moments of <b>interruptibility</b> within multiple human, multitasking interactions. The goal then becomes designing an intermediate step between human teammate communication and points of <b>interruptibility</b> within these interactions. The proposed intermediate step is the mapping of low-level speech information such as prosodic and lexical information onto higher constructs indicative of <b>interruptibility.</b> C-CIMS is composed of a Task Boundary Prosody Model, a Task Boundary Topic Model, and finally a Task Engagement Topic Model. Each of these components are evaluated separately in terms of how they perform within two different simulated human-machine teaming scenarios and the speed vs. accuracy tradeoffs as well as other limitations of each module. Overall the Task Boundary Prosody Model is tractable within a real-time system because of the low-latency in processing prosodic information, but is less accurate at predicting task boundaries even within human-machine interactions with simple dialogue. Conversely, the Task Boundary and Task Engagement Topic Models do well inferring task boundaries and engagement respectively, but are intractable in a real-time system because of the bottleneck in producing automatic speech recognition transcriptions to make interruption decisions. The overall contribution of this work is a novel approach to predicting <b>interruptibility</b> within human-machine teams by modeling higher constructs indicative of <b>interruptibility</b> using low-level speech information...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{aspect of}} {{handling}} interruption plays {{a vital role}} in human computer interaction. Interruptions become disruptive when they occur at inappropriate times. This is the reason that researchers are paying more attention towards predicting interruptions and their effects over the past few decades. We came up with an idea of finding self-initiated intermission to realize fewer distraction in human-computer interaction. Self-initiated intermission is an initiation to report oneself as being available for interaction. It gives the privilege of choosing appropriate time to handle interruptions, so that it would not hamper the current active tasks. Along with self-initiated intermission, <b>interruptibility</b> levels at the time of application switching and at regular intervals are studied. Then, the <b>interruptibility</b> levels in these three conditions are compared to find the most appropriate moment for handling interrupting events. The study shows that self-initiated intermission is the best moment for interrupting user which is less annoying than at the time of application switching and at regular intervals.
