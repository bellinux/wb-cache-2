60|$|The {{emotional}} {{appeal of}} those yells grew upon me steadily, grew {{at last to}} such an exquisite expression of suffering that I could stand it in that confined room no longer. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the door into the}} slumberous heat of the late afternoon, and walking past the main entrance--locked again, I noticed--turned the corner of the wall.|$|E

60|$|I {{disengaged}} {{myself from}} Sally, who was clinging to my hands, and <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> forward <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the corner. Steele had been running. Why did he hold his coat like that? I sensed action, {{and the cold}} thrill animated me.|$|R
60|$|But {{nothing in}} my manner, as <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the {{carriage}} under {{the porch of the}} house which loomed dark and massive out of the surrounding gloom, betrayed anything of what I felt.

60|$|Just {{then from}} the French ships in the harbour there came a great blaring of {{trumpets}} giving some alarm, and the Frenchmen of a sudden, ceasing from their attack, turned and ran towards the shore. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cave with William and looked. There on the sea, drawing near from the east before a good wind, I saw ships, and saw, too, that from their masts flew the pennons of England, for the golden leopards gleamed in the sun.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had been}} indebted to Maria {{for my first}} taste of Paradise. I was {{recalled}} by Maria {{to the world that}} I had been accustomed to live in; the world that was beginning to fade away in my memory already. She had been sent to the garden in search of me; and she had a word of advice to offer, after noticing my face when <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the shadow of the tree: [...] "Try to look more like yourself, miss, before you let them see you at the tea-table." ...|$|E
60|$|My spirits {{were high}} as I left {{the shores of}} England. I had a young man's hearty and natural {{enjoyment}} of change. Besides, it flattered my self-esteem to feel that I was my aunt's business-representative; and I was almost equally proud to be Fritz's confidential friend. Never could any poor human creature have been a more innocent instrument of mischief {{in the hands of}} Destiny than I was, on that fatal journey. The day was dark, when the old weary way of traveling brought me at last to Frankfort.

Sometimes <b>I</b> must <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the comfort of}} my {{clinical}} role and into that of patient or family caregiver.

6000|$|There {{are some}} of the grandest natural {{prospects}} on the face of creation in America. There is also to be found in certain States of the Union, by way of wholesome contrast, scenery as flat, as monotonous, and as uninteresting to the traveler, as any that the earth can show. The part of the country in which M. Meadowcroft's farm was situated fell within this latter category. I looked round me when <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the railway-carriage on the platform at Morwick Station; and I said to myself, [...] "If to be cured means, in my case, to be dull, I have accurately picked out the very place for the purpose." ...|$|E

Then at last the opportunity came, following on terrible provocation. That dark, foggy November night that you all remember so well! I was to meet my tyrant at the Veterans' Club at nine o'clock. I drove up there and as <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cab I {{came face to face}} with Luke. Something in the boy's manner told me what had happened.

The boat was all pearly like the inside of the mussel shells, and her sail was like moonshine. Well, I sailed right across to the sunset. Think of that--I've been in the sunset! And what do you suppose it is? The sunset is a land all flowers, like a great garden, and the clouds are beds of flowers. We sailed into a great big harbour, a {{thousand}} times bigger than the harbour over there at your hotel, and <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the boat on a 'normous meadow all roses. I stayed there for ever so long. It seemed almost a year, but the Youngest Twin Sailor says I was only away a few hours or so. You see, in Sunset Land the time is ever so much longer than it is here.

50|$|The role {{ultimately}} went to Shaleen Bhanot. Being a non-Sikh and Punjabi, Shaleen was in {{a cultural}} shock when the creative team of the show approached him. He researched {{for a period of}} six months to make sure his depiction of Maha Singh is impeccable. “I had to hire a Punjabi teacher which was another task living in Mumbai. For nine days <b>I</b> didn’t <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my home. <b>I</b> watched Punjabi movies and listened to Punjabi folk music. Now I think I am quite good at it,” Shaleen said.|$|R

6000|$|Next morning, {{after the}} cows had been milked and the cattle loosed from their kraals, he came accordingly, with a guard of about thirty men, {{all of them}} {{soldiers}} who had survived the great fight of the Amawombe. These warriors, {{some of whom had}} wounds that were scarcely healed, saluted me with loud cries of [...] "Inkoosi!" [...] and [...] "Baba" [...] as <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the wagon, where I had spent a wretched night of unpleasant anticipation, showing me that there were at least some Zulus with whom I remained popular. Indeed, their delight at seeing me, whom they looked upon as a comrade {{and one of the few}} survivors of the great adventure, was quite touching. As we went, which we did slowly, their captain told me of their fears that I had been killed with the others, and how rejoiced they were when they learned that I was safe. He told me also that, after the third regiment had attacked them and broken up their ring, a small body of them, from eighty to a hundred only, managed to cut a way through and escape, running, not towards the Tugela, where so many thousands had perished, but up to Nodwengu, where they reported themselves to Panda as the only survivors of the Amawombe.|$|E
60|$|It was {{my first}} idea to light up and be getting homeward; for the {{darkness}} and the glimmer of the dead wood and {{the shadows of the}} lantern made me lonely. But I knew where one of the harps hung; it seemed a pity it shouldn't go with the rest; {{and at the same time}} I couldn't help letting on to myself that I was mortal tired of my employment, and would like best to be at home and have the door shut. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cellar and argued it fore and back. There was a sound of the sea far down below me on the coast; nearer hand not a leaf stirred; I might have been the only living creature this side of Cape Horn. Well, as I stood there thinking, it seemed the bush woke and became full of little noises. Little noises they were, and nothing to hurt--a bit of a crackle, a bit of a rush--but the breath jumped right out of me and my throat went as dry as a biscuit. It wasn't Case I was afraid of, which would have been common-sense; I never thought of Case; what took me, as sharp as the colic, was the old wives' tales, the devil-women and the man-pigs. It was the toss of a penny whether I should run: but I got a purchase on myself, and stepped out, and held up the lantern (like a fool) and looked all round.|$|E
60|$|I was {{lighting}} my pipe as <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the inn at Cockermouth, and did {{not raise}} my head until I was fairly in the street. When I did so, it flashed upon me that I was in England; the evening sunlight lit up English houses, English faces, an English conformation of street,--as it were, an English atmosphere blew against my face. There is nothing perhaps more puzzling (if one thing in sociology can ever really be more unaccountable than another) than the great gulf that is set between England and Scotland--a gulf so easy in appearance, in reality so difficult to traverse. Here are two people almost identical in blood; pent up together on one small island, so that their intercourse (one would have thought) must be as close as that of prisoners who shared one cell of the Bastille; the same in language and religion; and yet {{a few years of}} quarrelsome isolation--a mere forenoon's tiff, as one may call it, in comparison with the great historical cycles--has so separated their thoughts and ways that not unions, not mutual dangers, nor steamers, nor railways, nor all the king's horses and all the king's men, seem able to obliterate the broad distinction. In the trituration of another century or so the corners may disappear; but in the meantime, in the year of grace 1871, I was as much in a new country as if I had been walking out of the Hotel St. Antoine at Antwerp.|$|E

40|$|To {{begin to}} {{understand}} our experience, {{as well as the}} experience of others, we first need to nurture our abilities to remain authentically present. Presence is a fundamental component to a rich and vibrant life, as well as a deeply influential aspect to the process of psychotherapy. In this account, I will elucidate an experience of attempting to remain present to my own existential processes and the experiential ramifications of such an activity. I will also expand on the importance of engaged presence in the psychotherapeutic process.

There is something different about today. The sun is out, the breeze is chilly but a nice relief, and the air smells like freshly fallen rain. I take all of this in—I allow myself to absorb the entire experience. Then a feeling begins to creep in. A slow churning in my stomach, a distant rumbling from somewhere right on the outskirts of my consciousness, a pause, and then a thought: What makes me...|$|R

60|$|Watts, {{after some}} weeks, {{desiring}} {{to have me}} in the composing-room, I left the pressmen; a new bien venu for drink (being five shillings) was demanded of me by the compositors. I thought it an imposition, as I had paid one to the pressmen; the master thought so too, and forbade my paying it. I stood out two or three weeks, was accordingly considered as an excommunicate, and had so many little pieces of private malice practised on me, by mixing my sorts, transposing and breaking my matter, &c., &c., if ever <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room, and all ascribed to the chapel ghost, which they said ever haunted those not regularly admitted, that, notwithstanding the master's protection, I found myself obliged to comply and pay the money, convinced of the folly of being on ill terms with those one is to live with continually. I was now on a fair footing with them, and soon acquired considerable influence. I proposed some reasonable alterations in their chapel[8] laws, and carried them against all opposition. From my example {{a great many of}} them left their muddling breakfast of beer, bread and cheese, finding they could with me be supplied from a neighbouring house with a large porringer of hot water-gruel, sprinkled with pepper, crumbled with bread, and a bit of butter in it, {{for the price of a}} pint of beer, viz., three halfpence. This was a more comfortable as well as a cheaper breakfast, and kept their heads clearer. Those who continued sotting with their beer all day, were often, by not paying, out of credit at the alehouse, and used to make interest with me to get beer, their light, as they phrased it, being out. I watched the pay-table on Saturday night, and collected what I stood engaged for them, having to pay sometimes near thirty shillings a week on their accounts. This, and my being esteemed a pretty good rig-ite, that is, a jocular verbal satirist, supported my consequence in the society. My constant attendance (I never making a St. Monday) recommended me to the master; and my uncommon quickness at composing occasioned my being put upon work of despatch, which was generally better paid; so I went on now very agreeably.|$|E
