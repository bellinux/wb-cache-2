5|$|Players can utilize Kinect to {{look into}} a corner using a new <b>head</b> <b>tracking</b> feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The {{controller}} or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing {{a modified version of}} the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.|$|E
