50|$|The Phrygian Kingdom {{essentially}} {{came into}} being after the fragmentation of the Hittite Empire during the 12th century BCE, and existed independently until the 7th century BCE. Possibly from the region of Thrace, the Phrygians eventually established their capital of Gordium (now Yazılıkaya).

5|$|In {{addition}} to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At {{the very end of}} the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is <b>held</b> <b>onto</b> a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.|$|E

25|$|The west-central area of Anatolia {{became the}} domain of the Phrygian Kingdom {{following}} the fragmentation of the Hittite Empire during the 12th century BCE, existing independently until the 7th century BCE, and strongly featured in Greek mythology. Although their origin is disputed, their language more resembled Greek (Dorian) than the Hittites whom they succeeded.

Attalus I, successor of Eumenes I, remained active outside of the boundaries of Pergamon. He refused protection payment to the Galatians and won a fight against them in 230 BCE, and then defeated Antiochus Hierax three years later {{in order to secure}} nominal control over Anatolia under the Seleucids. The victory was not to last as Seleucus III reestablished control of his empire, but Attalus was allowed to retain control of former territories of Pergamon.|$|R

There {{were many}} consecutive matches during the tour with no rest day in between, so Bradman ensured Miller and Lindwall remained fresh {{for the new}} ball bursts in the Tests by giving them a lighter workload during the tour matches. During all first-class matches, Johnston bowled 851.1 overs, Johnson 668, Lindwall 573.4, Toshack 502, while Miller bowled only 429.4 overs. Outside the Tests, Lindwall bowled 349.3 overs, only the fifth heaviest workload among the Australians in those matches.|$|E

5000|$|The {{construction}} {{method was}} to lay [...] "parallel lines of mud sills (ballast), {{eight or ten}} inches square, under where the rails would come", in places {{that did not have}} a firm foundation. On top of these sills were laid 4-by-6-inch or 4-by-8-inch oak [...] "stringers" [...] notched and pinned together. The rails were flat iron straps (section of rail) 12 to 15 feet long, two-and-a-half inches wide, and only five-eighths of an inch thick. Spikes <b>held</b> them <b>onto</b> the stringers, and their ends were mitered.

A technique is described for “spilling ” the display of a hand <b>held</b> computer <b>onto</b> a much larger table top display surface. Because our model of nomadic computing frequently {{involves the use of}} untrusted display services we restrict interactive input to the hand held. Navigation techniques such as scrolling or turning the display can be expressed through the table top. The orientation and position of the hand held on the table top is detected using three conductive feet that appear to the touch table like three finger touches. An algorithm is given for detecting the three touch positions from the table’s sensing mechanism. 1...|$|R

5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock <b>held</b> <b>onto</b> the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
5|$|Among African slaves, Catholicism was the {{religion}} of the majority. Most slaves came originally from the midwestern and southwestern portions of the African coast. For over four centuries this region had been the subject of Christian mission activities. Some Africans and their descendants, however, <b>held</b> <b>onto</b> elements of polytheistic religious traditions by merging them with Catholicism. This resulted in the creation of syncretic creeds such as Candomblé. Islam was also practiced among a small minority of African slaves, although it was harshly repressed {{and by the end of}} the 19th century had been completely extinguished. By the beginning of the 19th century, the Indians in most of eastern Brazil had been either assimilated or decimated. Some tribes resisted assimilation and either fled farther west, where they were able to maintain their diverse polytheistic beliefs, or were restricted to aldeamentos (reservations), where they eventually converted to Catholicism.|$|E

However an extra match was arranged when the second Test had to be abandoned {{after only a few}} overs play because the ground was unfit. England regained the trophy in May 2009, winning a two Test series 2–0.

He skied as fast as he could to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope.

Hope changed positions several times in this role, but he <b>held</b> <b>onto</b> the position for twenty years as a political favourite, a status maintained by being almost totally politically inactive.
