40|$|How {{does the}} {{structure}} of the economy affect the possibility for societal stability? This paper employs a cooperative game theory lens to explore possibilities for cooperation and chaos under various growth scenarios and assumptions of distributional equality in a hypothetical 2 -sector economy (industrialists and agriculturalists). It suggests that maintaining distributional equality amongst agriculturalists is only undesirable under the assumption that the manufacturing sector exhibits positive and decreasing returns to scale; if increasing or negative manufacturing returns are the case, agricultural equality becomes an important policy goal in maintaining stability. In the particular case of a shrinking economy, peace can be preserved given (a) fairly equitable land distribution, and (b) a healthy industrial sector serving agriculture. In terms of aid policy, I suggest that, under decreasing <b>industrial</b> <b>returns,</b> more resources available to an economy can promote cooperative frameworks, but that such boosts will entail a switch to economies structured around the industrial sector. I conclude with a suggestion for testing the model...|$|R

Also this article discussed the <b>industrial</b> <b>return</b> to the various member states. There were a few or no publications about the financing of ESA.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of the size factor for {{constructing}} investment portfolios and proposes a dynamic extension that accommodates the risk-free asset and time-varying weights. These weights are determined by a set of state variables given by the term structure of sovereign interest rates, variables describing market risk aversion such as the VIX index and the CRB <b>Industrial</b> <b>return,</b> and indexes reflecting investor sentiment towards the economic outlook. The empirical section explores the suitability of these state variables and analyses the out-of-sample performance of size factors idiosyncratic to the U. S., U. K. and European financial markets that are compared against the dynamic version that optimizes the weights in each period. The results provide support to the different size factors except for periods of economic distress in which the optimal dynamic strategies are clearly superior...|$|E

One example is the Sentinels constellation where five satellites will cover {{the full spectrum of}} Earth Observation tasks: all-weather imagery (Sentinel 1), land observation (Sentinel 2), marine services (Sentinels 3), weather forecast (Sentinel 4), and atmospheric chemistry (Sentinel 5). The synergic operation of this constellation will constitute an important element of the European system “Global Monitoring for Environment and Security”. A co-operation between ESA and NSO has been set to deploy a precursor of the Sentinel- 5 mission. The satellite will embark TROPOMI an instrument designed to reach the goal of boosting performance two orders of magnitude with respect to missions in operation.

40|$|The {{time-varying}} {{correlation between}} oil prices <b>returns</b> and European <b>industrial</b> sector indices <b>returns,</b> considering {{the origin of}} the oil price shock, is investigated. A time-varying multivariate heteroskedastic framework is employed to test the above hypothesis based on data from 10 European sectors. The contemporaneous correlations suggest that the relationship between sector indices and oil prices change over time and they are industry specific. In addition, the supply-side oil price shocks result in low to moderate positive correlation levels, the precautionary demand oil price shocks lead to almost zero correlation levels, whereas the aggregate demand oil price shocks generate significant changes in the correlation levels (either positive or negative). Both {{the origin of the}} oil price shock and the type of industry are important determinants of the correlation level between <b>industrial</b> sectors’ <b>returns</b> and oil prices.
