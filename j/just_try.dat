The next six hymns deal with Christian duties and are followed by ten hymns on the Gospels. The final works introduce the miscellaneous Christian virtues that were necessary to complete Christopher's original self-proclaimed [...] "plan to make good girls and boys." ...|$|E

[...] A sound recordist commented: [...] "I've seen screen kisses before but this was the best. They really went at it." [...] Roberts thought her appearance on the show was [...] "the most nerve-wracking thing" [...] she had done since auditioning for Pretty Woman. [...] "I wanted to be the best I could be.
