5000|$|Search {{neutrality}} is {{a principle}} that search engines {{should have no}} editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance.

[...] Search neutrality is related to network neutrality in that they both aim to keep any one organization from limiting or altering a user's access to services on the <b>Internet.</b> Search <b>neutrality</b> aims to keep the organic search results (results returned because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to results sponsored by advertising) of a search engine free from any manipulation, while network neutrality aims to keep those who provide and govern access to the Internet from limiting the availability of resources to access any given content.|$|R

There is none; it’s all anecdote, hypothesis, and hysteria. A small ISP in North Carolina allegedly blocked VoIP calls a decade ago. Comcast capped BitTorrent traffic to ease upload congestion eight years ago. Apple introduced Facetime over Wi-Fi first, cellular networks later.

There is not a shred of evidence that any aspect of this structure is necessary. The D.C. Circuit called the prior, scaled-down version a ‘prophylactic’ approach. I call it guilt by imagination." [...] In a Chicago Tribune article, FCC Commissioner Pai and Joshua Wright of the Federal Trade Commission argue that [...] "the Internet isn't broken, and we don't need the president's plan to 'fix' it.

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{provides}} an overview of the debate surrounding the issue of “network neutrality, ” which has vaulted to the forefront of telecommunications policy in the U. S., {{and to a lesser extent}} Canada, and considers its implications in the context of the deployment and delivery of broadband as an essential service in Ontario. Although the precise meaning of network neutrality is contested, it is typically defined as the principle that all traffic on the public internet be treated equally and without discrimination, regardless of source, ownership, or destination. At issue in the current debate are business and technological practices increasingly being adopted by broadband network owners and service providers – such as traffic shaping, content blocking and “bandwidth throttling ” for applications like VOIP and P 2 P networking – that deviate from network neutrality. The owners and operators of broadband network infrastructure and services argue that such discriminatory practices – dubbed by industry as “network diversity ”- are necessary to recoup investments, meet customer demand, and enhance user experience in a broadband world. Opponents of “network diversity ” argue that such discrimination violates the fundamental operating principle of the <b>internet</b> (net <b>neutrality)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Under strict net <b>neutrality</b> <b>Internet</b> service {{providers}} (ISPs) {{are required to}} carry data without any differentiation and {{at no cost to}} the content provider. We provide a simple framework with a monopoly ISP to evaluate different net neutrality rules. Content differs in its sensitivity to delay. Content providers can use congestion control techniques to reduce delay for their content, but do {{not take into account the}} effect of their decisions on the aggregate volume of traffic. As a result, strict net neutrality often leads to socially inefficient allocation of traffic and traffic inflation. We show that piece-meal departures from net neutrality, such as transmission fees or prioritization based on sensitivity to delay, do not necessarily improve efficiency. However, the ISP implements the efficient allocation when allowed to introduce bandwidth tiering and charge for prioritized delivery...|$|R
40|$|When {{they look}} at Internet policy, EU policymakers seem mesmerised, if not bewitched, by the word ‘neutrality’. Originally {{confined}} to the infrastructure layer, today the neutrality rhetoric is being expanded to multi-sided platforms such as search engines and more generally online intermediaries. Policies for search neutrality and platform neutrality are invoked to pursue a variety of policy objectives, encompassing competition, consumer protection, privacy and media pluralism. This paper analyses this emerging debate and comes {{to a number of}} conclusions. First, mandating net neutrality at the infrastructure layer might have some merit, but it certainly would not make the Internet neutral. Second, since most of the objectives initially associated with network neutrality cannot be realistically achieved by such a rule, the case for network neutrality legislation would have to stand on different grounds. Third, the fact that the Internet is not neutral is mostly a good thing for end users, who benefit from intermediaries that provide them with a selection of the over-abundant information available on the Web. Fourth, search neutrality and platform neutrality are fundamentally flawed principles that contradict the economics of the <b>Internet.</b> Fifth, <b>neutrality</b> is a very poor and ineffective recipe for media pluralism, and as such should not be invoked as the basis of future media policy. All these conclusions have important consequences for the debate on the future EU policy for the Digital Single Market...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} ethical issues {{surrounding}} {{the concept of}} <b>Internet</b> <b>neutrality</b> focusing specifically on the correlation between neutrality and fairness. Moving from {{an analysis of the}} many available definitions of <b>Internet</b> <b>neutrality</b> and the heterogeneity of the Internet infrastructure, the common assumption that a neutral Internet is also a fair Internet is challenged. It is argued that a properly neutral Internet supports undesirable situations in which few users can exhaust the majority of the available resources or in which specific types of applications and services cannot be developed or properly deployed. The solution offered to these shortcomings is based on (1) an environmental approach to the Internet, (2) the four guiding principles of Floridi???s Information Ethics and (3) a principle called ???Information Diversity???. The paper is divided into six sections. Section 1 briefly presents the debate concerning the concepts of network and <b>Internet</b> <b>neutrality.</b> Section 2 poses a general and unifying definition of <b>Internet</b> <b>neutrality</b> based on the critical assessment of several domain-specific approaches to the problem of neutrality. Section 3 is dedicated to the analysis of the relationship between <b>Internet</b> <b>neutrality</b> and the ethical principle of fairness. Section 4 introduces Floridi???s Information Ethics, the definition of Information Diversity and an analysis of how they can be used to address the limitations of <b>Internet</b> <b>neutrality.</b> Section 5 summarises the ethics of <b>Internet</b> <b>neutrality</b> and Information Diversity defining their relationship.
