He appeared to be much exhausted; but {{when he came to}} the thick black hedge he went through it as if it were made of spiders' webs;--or rather (for I heard the strong branches breaking and snapping like bayonets) as if he himself were made of stone.

Traditionally, U.S. radio stations (particularly those with such formats as adult contemporary, adult standards, easy listening, oldies, or beautiful music) began adding some Christmas-themed selections to their regular playlists shortly after Thanksgiving each year, typically culminating in 36–48 hours of continuous Christmas music between December 24–25.

The fair usually starts around three weeks before Holi and ends on the previous evening of the festival. Apart from usual trading and amusement facilities, municipality arranges for a special event in the evening. The trend so far has been that the last night of fair gets an orchestra.

The {{aim of the research}} was to investigate the low proficiency in English of the prospective teachers. This is in line with the move towards English as Medium of Instruction in the Curriculum of Teacher Education. The move is {{in view of the fact}} that all teachers, whether they teach History, Geography or Biology, must remember that they are also language teachers. All teachers must be able to speak and write English proficiently in order to address and solve the problem of transition of medium of instruction, that is from vernacular to English in Grade 5 and <b>earlier.</b> <b>This</b> could <b>even</b> be worse if we think in terms of the communication learning area in OBE where English could start in the lowest grade as medium of instruction.
