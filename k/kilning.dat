25|$|In general, none {{of these}} early malts would have been well {{shielded}} from the smoke involved in the <b>kilning</b> process, and consequently, early beers {{would have had a}} smoky component to their flavors; evidence indicates that maltsters and brewers constantly tried to minimize the smokiness of the finished beer.|$|E
25|$|An oast, oast {{house or}} hop kiln is a {{building}} designed for <b>kilning</b> (drying) hops {{as part of}} the brewing process. They can be found in most hop-growing (and former hop-growing) areas and are often good examples of vernacular architecture. Many redundant oasts have been converted into houses. The names oast and oast house are used interchangeably in Kent and East Sussex. In Surrey, Hampshire, Hereford and Worcester they are always called hop kilns.|$|E
500|$|The grain used in Grodziskie is malted wheat. [...] During the malting process, {{the wheat}} is dried in kilns that are heated by oak-burning {{furnaces}}. [...] Instead {{of using the}} furnaces to heat air which is then used to dry the wheat, the hot smoke from the kilns is forced directly through the grain bed. [...] The smoke dries the grain, and imparts a light color and an intense, pleasant, smoky flavor. [...] This [...] process {{would not be possible}} in the type of kilns that were more common in the past, that burned coal or coke as fuel because the soot in the smoke would cause the grain to become discolored and contribute undesirable harsh flavors. [...] The exact degree of smokiness that resulted from the oak <b>kilning</b> in historical times is not known. [...] The smoke from the malting process also adds chemical components to the finished product that help preserve it, giving it a long shelf life despite its low alcohol content. [...] One story is told of a box of Grodziskie being found in the 1950s, buried in the sands of North Africa, that was left behind by German soldiers during World War II. [...] The beer was opened and found to be as fresh as the day it was made. [...] In addition to wheat, there were periods when the beer also included malted barley in various proportions, but for most of its history, it was made entirely from wheat.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967, <b>Kiln</b> 5 (...) was installed. This was a {{much more}} {{efficient}} dry process <b>kiln.</b> The wet process <b>kilns</b> were decommissioned in 1974, and <b>Kiln</b> 6 - also a dry <b>kiln</b> - (...) was started in 1975. <b>Kiln</b> 6 remains in operation today.|$|R
25|$|Conventional wood dry <b>kilns</b> (Rasmussen, 1988) {{are either}} package-type (sideloader) or track-type (tram) construction. Most {{hardwood}} lumber <b>kilns</b> are sideloader <b>kilns</b> in which fork trucks {{are used to}} load lumber packages into the <b>kiln.</b> Most softwood lumber <b>kilns</b> are track types in which lumber packages are loaded on kiln/track cars for loading the <b>kiln.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Griggsville Landing Lime <b>Kiln</b> {{is one of}} only a few old lime <b>kilns</b> {{preserved}} {{across the}} state of Illinois. Some examples can be found in such places as, Maeystown, where a periodic vertical <b>kiln</b> remains, Kankakee River State Park in Will County, where pieces of an old lime <b>kiln</b> lie in an old limestone quarry. Other <b>kilns</b> can be found in Ogle County, near Polo, where a stone <b>kiln</b> remains, a poorly preserved vertical <b>kiln</b> in Port Byron and a well-preserved <b>kiln</b> in Cordova, Illinois.|$|R
2500|$|Malt {{is often}} {{divided into two}} {{categories}} by brewers: base malts and specialty malts; base malts have enough diastatic power to convert their own starch and usually that of some amount of starch from unmalted grain, called adjuncts, while specialty malts have little diastatic power, but provide flavor, color, or [...] "body" [...] (viscosity) to the finished beer. Specialty caramel or crystal malts {{have been subjected to}} heat treatment to convert their starches to sugars nonenzymatically. Within these categories is a variety of types distinguished largely by the <b>kilning</b> temperature (see mash ingredients).|$|E
50|$|The high {{temperatures}} of <b>kilning</b> also produce the colour in the malt through the Maillard reaction.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{intermittent}} <b>kiln.</b> the ware to {{be fired}} is placed into the <b>kiln.</b> The <b>kiln</b> is closed, and the internal temperature increased according to a schedule. After the firing is completed, both the <b>kiln</b> and the ware are cooled. The ware is removed, the <b>kiln</b> is cleaned and the next cycle begins. <b>Kilns</b> in this type include: ...|$|R
50|$|Shuttle Kilns: {{this is a}} car-bottom <b>kiln</b> with a door on one or both ends. Burners are {{positioned}} top and bottom on each side, creating a turbulent circular air flow. This type of <b>kiln</b> is generally a multi-car design and is used for processing whitewares, technical ceramics and refractories in batches. Depending upon size and mass of ware, shuttle <b>kilns</b> may be equipped with car moving devices to transfer fired and unfired ware {{in and out of}} the <b>kiln.</b> Shuttle <b>kilns</b> can be either updraft or downdraft in design. A Shuttle <b>Kiln</b> derives its name from the fact that <b>kiln</b> cars can enter a shuttle <b>kiln</b> from either end of the <b>kiln</b> for processing, whereas a tunnel <b>kiln</b> has flow in only one direction.|$|R
50|$|Other {{historic}} charcoal <b>kilns</b> in the United States {{include the}} Cottonwood Charcoal <b>Kilns</b> at Owens Lake, the Piedmont Charcoal <b>Kilns</b> in Wyoming, and the Walker Charcoal <b>Kiln</b> in Arizona.|$|R
5000|$|One notable {{aspect of}} this city {{includes}} Shōdai ware, an art form almost completely exclusive to Arao, involving slow <b>kilning</b> and under glazing.|$|E
50|$|The {{wet process}} begins with {{steeping}} to get germination started {{and ends with}} <b>kilning</b> which removes the moisture and produces a stable final product.|$|E
50|$|S-Methylmethionine {{is found}} in barley and during the malting process, {{particularly}} the curing stage in <b>kilning,</b> heat causes it to break down to form dimethyl sulfide (DMS).|$|E
50|$|The {{type and}} the size of <b>kilns</b> that are used in raku are crucial in the outcome. One aspect that can affect the results is the use of {{electric}} versus gas <b>kilns.</b> Electric <b>kilns</b> allow easy temperature control. Gas <b>kilns,</b> which comprise brick or ceramic fibers, can be used in either oxidation or reduction firing and use propane or natural gas. Gas <b>kilns</b> also heat more quickly than electric <b>kilns,</b> but it is more difficult to maintain temperature control. There is a note-worthy difference when using an updraft <b>kiln</b> rather than a downdraft <b>kiln.</b> An updraft <b>kiln</b> has shelves that trap heat. This effect creates uneven temperatures throughout the <b>kiln.</b> Conversely, a downdraft <b>kiln</b> pulls air down a separate stack on the side and allows a more even temperature throughout and allows the work to be layered on shelves.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>kiln</b> at the Coplay Cement Company was a dome <b>kiln.</b> Dome <b>kilns</b> were inefficient; {{they had}} to shut down often. In 1893 Coplay Cement built Mill B, {{containing}} the Schoefer <b>kilns</b> standing today. Originally enclosed in a large building, Schoefer <b>kilns</b> could run continuously. Soon, however, the even more efficient rotary <b>kilns</b> came into use. Mill B’s outdated Schoefer <b>kilns</b> shut down in 1904, and Coplay Cement later used Mill B’s buildings for storage.|$|R
50|$|Buffalo Grove Lime <b>Kiln</b> {{is one of}} two old lime <b>kilns</b> in Illinois {{listed on}} the National Register of Historic Places. The other is the Griggsville Landing Lime <b>Kiln</b> in Pike County. Buffalo Grove Lime <b>Kiln</b> is located near the Ogle County city of Polo. When in use, the <b>kiln</b> would have {{produced}} raw quicklime. The lime <b>kiln</b> was added to the National Register in 2002.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Kilning</b> thus {{reduces the}} grain {{moisture}} content and stops the germination process. In the first stage, the free drying stage the air temperatures are kept cool to dry the grain without causing the enzymes to denature.|$|E
50|$|Modern methods employ {{retorting}} technology, {{in which}} process heat is recovered from, and solely provided by, the combustion of gas released during carbonisation. (Illustration:). Yields of retorting are considerably {{higher than those}} of <b>kilning,</b> and may reach 35%-40%.|$|E
50|$|Crystal malts, or caramel malts are {{prepared}} separately from pale malts. They are high-nitrogen malts that are wetted and roasted in a rotating drum before <b>kilning.</b> They produce strongly sweet toffee-like flavors and are sufficiently converted {{that they can}} be steeped without mashing to extract their flavor. Crystal malts are available in a range of colors, with darker-colored crystal malts kilned at higher temperatures producing stronger, more caramel-like overtones. Some of the sugars in crystal malts caramelize during <b>kilning</b> and become unfermentable. Hence, adding crystal malt increases the final sweetness of a beer. They contain no enzymes. ASBC 50-165/EBC 90-320; the typical British crystal malt used in pale ale and bitter is around ASBC 70-80.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 18th to early 19th century, white {{porcelain}} clay {{was discovered in}} other areas of Japan (e.g., Amakusa) and was traded domestically, and potters were allowed to move more freely. Local lords and merchants established many new <b>kilns</b> (e.g., Kameyama <b>kiln</b> and Tobe <b>kiln)</b> for economic profit, and old <b>kilns</b> such as Seto restarted as porcelain <b>kilns.</b> These many <b>kilns</b> are called [...] "New Kilns" [...] and they popularized porcelain {{in the style of the}} Arita <b>kilns</b> among the common folk.|$|R
50|$|The heap <b>kiln</b> went by {{the wayside}} as the {{periodic}} <b>kiln</b> came into vogue. Periodic <b>kilns</b> are much more efficient than the log heap <b>kiln</b> that preceded them. The most efficient type of periodic <b>kiln</b> is a stone or brick walled vertical <b>kiln.</b> This walled vertical <b>kiln</b> is what appears at Griggsville Landing. The specific <b>kiln</b> at Griggsville has an opening at the base and at the top, with walls nearly three feet thick. The appearance of {{the walls of the}} Griggsville Landing <b>Kiln</b> suggests that they were either dry laid or laid with a mud mortar that has since been dusted away by time. The walls of the vertical <b>kiln</b> at Griggsville Landing rise 17 feet above the forest floor and the inside has a diameter of 13 feet.|$|R
5000|$|The Hoffmann <b>kiln</b> is {{a series}} of batch process <b>kilns.</b> Hoffmann <b>kilns</b> are the most common <b>kiln</b> used in {{production}} of bricks and some other ceramic products. Patented by German Friedrich Hoffmann for brickmaking in 1858, it was later used for lime-burning, and was known as the Hoffmann continuous <b>kiln.</b>|$|R
50|$|Similarly to crystal malts in Britain, central Europe {{makes use}} of caramel malts, which are {{moistened}} and kilned at temperatures around 55-65 °C in a rotating drum before being heated to higher temperatures for browning. The lower-temperature moistened <b>kilning</b> causes conversion and mashing {{to take place in}} the oven, resulting in a grain's starches becoming mostly or entirely converted to sugar before darkening. Caramel malts are produced in color grades analogous to other lager malts: carapils for pilsener malt, caravienne or carahell for Vienna malt, and caramunch for Munich malt. Color and final <b>kilning</b> temperature are comparable to non-caramel analog malts; there is no diastatic activity. Carapils malt is sometimes also called dextrin malt. 10-120 °L.|$|E
50|$|Pale malt in Belgium is {{generally}} darker than British pale malt. <b>Kilning</b> {{takes place at}} temperatures five to ten °C lower than for British pale malt, but for longer periods; diastatic power is {{comparable to that of}} British pale malt. ASBC 4/EBC 7.|$|E
50|$|The new recipe of the {{improved}} lager beer spread quickly over Europe. In particular Sedlmayr's friend Anton Dreher adopted new <b>kilning</b> techniques that enabled {{the use of}} lighter malts to improve the Viennese beer in 1840-1841, creating a rich amber-red coloured Vienna-style lager.|$|E
5000|$|Research by Kara {{estimates}} {{there to}} be between 55,000 and 65,000 brick <b>kilns</b> in South Asia with 70% of them in India. Other research estimates 6,000 <b>kilns</b> in Pakistan alone. Total revenue from brick <b>kilns</b> in South Asia is estimated by Kara to be $13.3 to $15.2 billion. Many of the brick <b>kiln</b> workers are migrants and travel between brick <b>kiln</b> locations every few months. <b>Kiln</b> workers often live in extreme poverty and many began work at <b>kilns</b> through repayment of a starting loan averaging $150 to $200. <b>Kiln</b> owners offer laborers [...] "friendly loans" [...] to avoid being criminalized in breaking bonded labor laws. Bonded brick <b>kiln</b> laborers, including children, work in harsh and unsafe conditions as {{the heat from the}} <b>kiln</b> may cause heat stroke {{and a number of other}} medical conditions. Although these laborers do have the option to default on loans, there is fear of death and violence by brick <b>kiln</b> owners if they choose to do so.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the centre}} of the works is the bank of eight lime <b>kilns.</b> The {{original}} six <b>kilns</b> were draw <b>kilns</b> with a continuous retaining wall 6.3 m high along the front, with concrete buttresses between each <b>kiln.</b> The <b>kilns</b> extend to a further 2.9 m above the retaining wall. The <b>kiln</b> pots are about 3.0 m in diameter at the top and taper down to rectangular draw holes at the bottom which are 1.6 m x 0.8 m in dimension. The draw hole grates support raking irons in the bottom of each <b>kiln.</b> At the front of each <b>kiln,</b> there are semi-circular draw arches.|$|R
5000|$|A {{continuous}} <b>kiln,</b> {{sometimes called}} a tunnel <b>kiln,</b> {{is a long}} structure in which only the central portion is directly heated. From the cool entrance, ware is slowly transported through the <b>kiln,</b> and its temperature is increased steadily as it approaches the central, hottest part of the <b>kiln.</b> From there, it continues through the <b>kiln,</b> and the surrounding temperature is reduced until it exits the <b>kiln</b> nearly at room temperature. A continuous <b>kiln</b> is energy-efficient, because heat given off during cooling is recycled to pre-heat the incoming ware. In some designs, the ware is left in one place, while the heating zone moves across it. <b>Kilns</b> in this type include: ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the last}} few hours of <b>kilning</b> the air on {{temperature}} is raised to above 80 °C (the curing stage) to break SMM down to DMS to reduce the DMS potential of the malt. DMS is an off flavour that tastes like sweetcorn in the final beer.|$|E
50|$|British brewing {{makes use}} {{of a wide variety}} of malts, with {{considerable}} stylistic freedom for the brewer to blend them. Many British malts were developed only as recently as the Industrial Revolution, as improvements in temperature-controlled <b>kilning</b> allowed finer control over the drying and toasting of the malted grains.|$|E
50|$|In general, none {{of these}} early malts would have been well {{shielded}} from the smoke involved in the <b>kilning</b> process, and consequently, early beers {{would have had a}} smoky component to their flavors; evidence indicates that maltsters and brewers constantly tried to minimize the smokiness of the finished beer.|$|E
5000|$|The Fuel Efficient <b>Kiln</b> {{project was}} begun when {{volunteer}} Manny Hernandez designed a <b>kiln</b> that uses 50% less firewood to fire pottery. These <b>kilns,</b> called [...] "Mani" [...] <b>kilns,</b> {{have been built}} worldwide, totaling at least 60 so far.|$|R
50|$|The 75 <b>kilns</b> in Yongunni are in {{generally}} {{in good condition}} and {{are some of the}} earliest dated. These <b>kilns</b> are dated to the 10th and 11th centuries. These <b>kilns</b> provide clues for scholars interested in discovering the origins and <b>kiln</b> characteristics of the first Korean celadons manufactured. Fragments of ancient Chinese <b>kiln</b> products have also been uncovered in this region.|$|R
50|$|<b>Kiln</b> No. 2 {{was built}} {{adjacent}} to <b>Kiln</b> No. 1 and {{immediately to the}} north, similarly facing west towards the creek. It consisted of limestone laid in lime mortar probably produced by <b>Kiln</b> No. 1. It was larger, being oval in vertical section, nine feet in diameter side to side and nine feet ten inches in diameter front to rear. It was lined entirely with fireclay applied like plaster. This <b>kiln</b> sat farther forward than the other two, its front face extending seven feet beyond <b>Kiln</b> 1 and four feet beyond the front face of <b>Kiln</b> 3. A large Douglas fir, which according to tree ring dating sprouted after 1870, grew from the rubble between <b>Kiln</b> 1 and <b>Kiln</b> 2, severely damaging both <b>kilns.</b> <b>Kiln</b> No. 2 still has a well-preserved front arched entrance, measuring six feet {{from side to side}} at the base and two feet six inches wide {{at the entrance to the}} barrel, tapering inward.|$|R
