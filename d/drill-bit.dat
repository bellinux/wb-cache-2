40|$|Abstract — Despite {{considerable}} advances {{over the}} last few decades in sensing instrumentation and information technology infrastructure, monitoring and diagnostics technology has not yet found its place in health management of mainstream machinery and equipment. The fundamental reason for this being the mismatch between the growing diversity and complexity of machinery and equipment employed in industry and the historical reliance on “point-solution ” diagnostic systems that necessitate extensive characterization of the failure modes and mechanisms (something very expensive and tedious). While these point solutions have a role to play, in particular for monitoring highly-critical assets, generic yet adaptive solutions, meaning solutions that are flexible and able to learn on-line, could facilitate large-scale deployment of diagnostic and prognostic technology. We present a novel approach for autonomous diagnostics that employs model-based sequential clustering with hidden-Markov models as a means for measuring similarity of time-series sensor signals. The proposed method has been tested on a CNC machining test-bed outfitted with thrust-force and torque sensors for monitoring <b>drill-bits.</b> Preliminary results revealed the competitive performance of the method.

40|$|Failure {{mechanisms}} of electromechanical systems usually involve several degraded health-states. Tracking and forecasting {{the evolution of}} health-states and impending failures, {{in the form of}} remaining-useful-life (RUL), is a critical challenge and regarded as the Achilles' heel of condition-based-maintenance (CBM). This paper demonstrates how this difficult problem can be addressed through Hidden Markov models (HMMs) that are able to estimate unobservable health-states using observable sensor signals. In particular, implementation of HMM based models as dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) facilitates compact representation as well as additional flexibility with regard to model structure. Both regular HMM pools and hierarchical HMMs are employed here to estimate online the health-state of <b>drill-bits</b> as they deteriorate with use on a CNC drilling machine. Hierarchical HMM is composed of sub-HMMs in a pyramid structure, providing functionality beyond an HMM for modeling complex systems. In the case of regular HMMs, each HMM within the pool competes to represent a distinct health-state and adapts through competitive learning. In the case of hierarchical HMMs, health-states are represented as distinct nodes {{at the top of the}} hierarchy. Monte Carlo simulation, with state transition probabilities derived from a hierarchical HMM, is employed for RUL estimation. Detailed results on health-state and RUL estimation are very promising and are reported in this paper. Hierarchical HMMs seem to be particularly effective and efficient and outperform other HMM methods from literature...|$|R

In {{three years of the}} program, we designed and built several laboratory scale microwave sintering systems for conducting experiments on Tungsten carbide (WC) based composites in controlled atmosphere. The processing conditions were optimized and various properties were measured. The design of the system was then modified to enable it to process large commercial parts of WC/Co and in large quantities. Two high power (3 - 6 kW) microwave systems of 2. 45 GHz were built for multi samples runs in a batch process. Once the process was optimized for best results, the technology was successfully transferred to our industrial partner, Dennis Tool Co. We helped them to built couple of prototype microwave sintering systems for carbide tool manufacturing. It was found that the microwave processed WC/Co tools are not only cost effective but also exhibited much better overall performance than the standard tools. The results of the field tests performed by Dennis Tool Co. showed remarkable advantage and improvement in their overall performance. For example: wear test shows an increase of 20 - 30 %, corrosion test showed much higher resistance to the acid attack, erosion test exhibited about 15 % better resistance than standard sinter-HIP parts.

40|$|In {{the field}} of seismic interferometry, {{researchers}} have retrieved surface waves and body waves by cross-correlating recordings of uncorrelated noise sources to extract useful subsurface information. The retrieved wavefields in most applications are between receivers. When {{the positions of the}} noise sources are known, inter-source interferometry can be applied to retrieve the wavefields between sources, thus turning sources into virtual receivers. Previous applications of this form of interferometry assume impulsive point sources or transient sources with similar signatures. We investigate the requirements of applying inter-source seismic interferometry using non-transient noise sources with known positions to retrieve reflection responses at those positions and show the results using synthetic drilling noise as source. We show that, if pilot signals (estimates of the <b>drill-bit</b> signals) are not available, it is required that the <b>drill-bit</b> signals are the same and that the phases of the virtual reflections at <b>drill-bit</b> positions can be retrieved by deconvolution interferometry or by cross-coherence interferometry. Further, for this case, classic interferometry by cross-correlation can be used if the source power spectrum can be estimated. If pilot signals are available, virtual reflection responses can be obtained by first using standard seismic-while-drilling processing techniques such as pilot cross-correlation and pilot deconvolution to remove the <b>drill-bit</b> signatures in the data and then applying cross-correlation interferometry. Therefore, provided that pilot signals are reliable, <b>drill-bit</b> data can be redatumed from surface to borehole depths using this inter-source interferometry approach without any velocity information of the medium, and we show that a well-positioned image below the borehole can be obtained using interferometrically redatumed reflection responses with just a simple velocity model.

Here, the data are recorded on the earth’s free surface while a tri-cone <b>drill-bit</b> and down hole motor were used to drill along a horizontal trajectory {{at a depth of}} 9188 ft in the Austin Chalk formation. Crosscorrelogram and autocorrelogram time migration is implemented with a ghost reflection-imaging condi-tion. Both methods do not require the pilot signal and wavelet history.

40|$|In {{drilling}} for oil, we occasionally encounter overpressured shale zones {{which can be}} disastrous to drilling. The overpressured zones usually exhibit lower electrical resistivity. Electromagnetic methods are therefore proposed to predict the location and intensity of the overpressured zones at tens of meters ahead of a <b>drill-bit.</b> The existing methods in petroleum well logging {{are sensitive to the}} formation volume up to 3 meters lateral to the borehole. To predict the formation ahead of <b>drill-bit,</b> it is essential to use a time-domain or a wide-band frequency domain approach. In a conductive medium, the high frequency fields are more confined to the volume around the source while the low frequency components reach larger volume of formation. In the time-domain situation, early time response is closely related to the formation property near the sensor while later time measurement is more sensitive to the property of the far away formation. It is found that the presence of an overpressured zone at 10 's of meters ahead of a <b>drill-bit</b> can be detected.

Three laboratory and one full–scale drilling tests were performed using nine CC grades with different binder contents, binder chemical compositions, mean tungsten carbide (WC) grain sizes, and grain size distributions. Wear traces found on the <b>drill–bit</b> inserts after the full–scale drilling test show noticeable differences depending on their position on the <b>drill–bit.</b> Tensile forces present on {{the leading edge of the}} inserts due to the sliding contact with rock are suspected to play a significant role. Laboratory tests performed include: (i) single impact tests using a modified Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) apparatus, (ii) Abrasion Value (AV) rotating disk tests, and (iii) impact abrasion (LCPC) tests. Volume loss and shape change were used as macroscopic measures of wear. Greater volume losses were found for the grades with nickel–based binders compared to those with pure cobalt binder. The use of a narrower WC grain size distribution leads to lesser volume loss in drilling and AV tests. Surface analysis of the damaged microstructure was performed using scanning electron microscope. Distinct meso–scale (few dozens of WC grain sizes) patterns of damaged microstructure zones surrounded by the intact surface were found on the surfaces of specimens after single impact test. The pattern indicates the potential influence of a non–uniform contact due to the rock roughness and internal rock heterogeneities, which is supported by the study of the rock crater roughness. Size of such zones could be seen as a certain length–scale, which determines the insert–rock contact behaviour.

40|$|Seismic {{interferometry}} is a {{field of}} growing interest in exploration seismology. In this paper we provide the theoretical basis for performing interferometry by deconvolution. We argue that for arbitrarily complicated models, deconvolution interferometry gives the causal scattering response between any two receivers. Interferometry by cross-correlation, on the other hand, gives both causal and acausal scattering responses. Even with a closed surface of integration, deconvolution interferometry also gives rise to spurious events not present in its cross-correlation counterpart. These events arise from an extra boundary condition which is imposed by the deconvolution method in interferometry. We demonstrate the feasibility of deconvolution interferometry with numerical examples with impulsive sources, and show that the deconvolution interferometry artifacts typically are not mapped onto the image space.

40|$|Traditional rotary {{drilling}} for planetary rock sampling, in situ analysis, and sample return are challenging because {{the axial force}} and holding torque requirements are not necessarily compatible with lightweight spacecraft architectures in low-gravity environments. This paper seeks to optimize an ultrasonic percussive drill tool to achieve rock penetration with lower reacted force requirements, with a strategic view toward building an ultrasonic planetary core drill (UPCD) device. The UPCD is a descendant of the ultrasonic/sonic driller/corer technique. In these concepts, a transducer and horn (typically resonant at around 20 kHz) are used to excite a toroidal free mass that oscillates chaotically between the horn tip and drill base at lower frequencies (generally between 10 Hz and 1 kHz). This creates a series of stress pulses that is transferred through the drill bit to the rock surface, and while the stress at the <b>drill-bit</b> tip/rock interface exceeds the compressive strength of the rock, it causes fractures that result in fragmentation of the rock. This facilitates augering and downward progress. In {{order to ensure that}} the <b>drill-bit</b> tip delivers the greatest effective impulse (the time integral of the <b>drill-bit</b> tip/rock pressure curve exceeding the strength of the rock), parameters such as the spring rates and the mass of the free mass, the drill bit and transducer have been varied and compared in both computer simulation and practical experiment.
