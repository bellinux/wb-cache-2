500|$|Season 16 {{featured}} {{one of the}} {{few major}} character developments since the show's inception. It was reported a long time in advance of the airing of the episode [...] "There's Something About Marrying" [...] that a major character would come out as gay during the episode. At the San Diego Comic-Con International convention in July 2004, Al Jean revealed: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> where, to raise money, Springfield legalises gay marriage. Homer becomes a minister by going on the internet and filling out a form. A long-time character comes out of the closet, but I'm not saying who." [...] This led to much media speculation and publicity in the press for the episode. Many fans correctly guessed that it would be one of Homer's sisters-in-law, either Patty or Selma, while others believed it to be Waylon Smithers.|$|E
500|$|To {{celebrate}} the 20th {{anniversary of the}} premiere of The Simpsons, Fox announced a year-long celebration of the show titled [...] "Best. 20 Years. Ever.", which ran from January 14, 2009 to January 14, 2010. Morgan Spurlock, an Academy Award nominated documentary filmmaker (Best Documentary Feature for Super Size Me in 2004) and fan of The Simpsons since his college days, was asked to direct the special The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special – In 3-D! On Ice! in February 2009. Spurlock believes [...] "the reason [...] called [...] to begin with was to not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> {{that would be a}} glad-hand, pat-everyone-on-the-back special, that's why rooting it in the people who kept this show on the air for the last 20 years is important." [...] It was shown on January 10, 2010 alongside [...] "Once Upon a Time in Springfield", which was promoted as the 450th episode of the series.|$|E

500|$|Each episode took {{approximately}} {{two months to}} edit, and editing usually began as the episodes were still being shot. The editors would work on two episodes simultaneously. Following {{the completion of the}} episodes, Muskett added the score for them. The episodes include split screen sequences. Although the sequences were presented in a similar vein to the American action series 24, the split screen idea did not come from the show itself; Nalluri thought of it independently after visiting a pub one night after filming wrapped up. The series also introduced the premise of not including any production credits. The producers agreed that adding credits would be a waste of time, and that the viewers would pay no attention to them. However, they also saw this as an opportunity; as Spooks is a spy show, Wolstencroft had the idea that it would be [...] "cool" [...] to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> that was anonymous, and it would fit the spirit of the series.|$|E
500|$|The first UK Kennel Club {{registered}} American Cocker Spaniel was Aramingo Argonaught, born 17 January 1956 {{and bred}} by Herbert L. Steinberg. Two judges {{confirmed that the}} dog was an American Cocker and not an English Cocker before the Kennel Club permitted the dog to be shown. In the 1960s they were shown as a rare breed, which meant {{that they did not}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> class of their own and could only be shown in variety classes. This included Aramingo Argonaught, who was the first American Cocker Spaniel to be shown at Crufts in 1960 in a class entitled [...] "Any variety not classified at this show". In 1968, the KC agreed to have the breed shown in the category [...] "Any variety gundog other than Cocker" [...] and stated that the American Cocker was not a variety of [...] "Spaniel (Cocker)". There were around 100 registrations between 1966 and 1968.|$|E
500|$|Josh Jackson of Paste Magazine {{disliked the}} [...] "deus ex machina" [...] aspects that [...] "neatly solved the puzzles {{of the first}} two episodes", and also criticized {{perceived}} [...] "plot contrivances" [...] like how the serial murderer immediately began aging once interrupted from killing his last victim. Despite these flaws, Jackson said he would tune in next week because he would [...] "rather <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> {{err on the side of}} unbelievable than unremarkable, and I'm interested to see if Abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve". Erin Fox of TV Guide also liked [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] better than the pilot because she thought that it [...] "had really cool special effects, awesome Walter-isms, and actual chemistry forming between Olivia and Peter", and [...] "we also got to delve more into the connections between Walter, Nina Sharp, Massive Dynamic and the government and the experiments they conducted before Walter was institutionalized".|$|E

500|$|Nine actors had star billing in the show's first season. Series creator Shonda Rhimes {{wanted a}} diverse cast, and so created {{characters}} without pre-specified races. Determined not to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> in which [...] "all the extras are white, except the lone janitor", she has created what The New York Times has called [...] "one {{of the most}} colorful backgrounds in television". Rhimes used a [...] "blind-casting" [...] technique, which resulted in several roles going to actors of different racial backgrounds than first envisioned. Isaiah Washington, eventually cast as Preston Burke, was originally considered {{for the role of}} Derek Shepherd, while Burke was initially to be played by a white actor who dropped out at the last moment. Chandra Wilson was cast in the role of Miranda Bailey, who Rhimes had imagined as a blonde until auditioning Wilson. The Campus have observed that the Grey's Anatomy cast is actually more diverse than the city it emulates, noting that Seattle is actually 70% Caucasian.|$|E
500|$|... "There's Something About Marrying" [...] was {{originally}} broadcast on February 20, 2005 in the United States. It was reported {{a long time}} in advance of the episode's airing that a major character would come out as gay during the episode. At the Comic-Con convention in July 2004, Al Jean revealed: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> where, to raise money, Springfield legalises gay marriage. Homer becomes a minister by going on the internet and filling out a form. A long-time character comes out of the closet, but I'm not saying who." [...] This led to much media speculation and publicity in the press for the episode. The last such [...] "mystery Simpsons storyline", as BBC News called it, occurred with the [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily" [...] episode in which it was announced prior to the broadcast that a character would be killed in the episode, leading to weeks of speculation before the revelation that it was Maude Flanders.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} characters graduated from McKinley High {{at the end of}} the third season. Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When I read that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." [...] He then continued: [...] "They're all coming back. Anyone who is a regular is coming back. Everyone said yes." ...|$|E

500|$|The main cast of {{the season}} {{consisted}} of Dan Castellaneta (Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, among others), Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson), Nancy Cartwright (Bart Simpson, Ralph Wiggum, Nelson Muntz), Yeardley Smith (Lisa Simpson), Hank Azaria (Moe Szyslak, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Chief Wiggum, among others) and Harry Shearer (Ned Flanders, Mr. Burns, Principal Skinner, among others). Up until the production of season ten in 1998, these six main voice actors were paid $30,000 per episode. In 1998, a salary dispute {{between them and the}} Fox Broadcasting Company (which airs The Simpsons) arose, with the actors threatening to go on a strike. Fox went as far as preparing for casting of new voices, but an agreement was soon made and the actors' salaries were raised to $125,000 per episode. Groening expressed his sympathy for the cast members in an issue of Mother Jones a while after the salary dispute had been settled. He told the magazine: [...] "They are incredibly talented, and they deserve a chance to be as rich and miserable as anyone else in Hollywood. It looked for a while there like we might not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>show,</b> because everyone was holding firm on all sides. That's still my attitude: Hold out for as much money as you can get, but do make the deal." ...|$|E
