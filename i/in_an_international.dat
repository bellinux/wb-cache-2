5|$|Apart from team records, {{individual}} records were also broken in the match. Australia's Archie Thompson, who only had two international caps and one international goal {{prior to the}} match, scored 13 goals in the match and broke the record for most goals scored <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>international</b> match. David Zdrilic scored 8 goals and was widely reported as having recorded the second most goals scored <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>international</b> match, after Thompson's 13 goals. In fact, his figure was less than the previous record of 10 goals, which was achieved by Denmark's Sophus Nielsen at the 1908 Olympics and Germany's Gottfried Fuchs at the 1912 Olympics. Nevertheless, this made Zdrilic's total the second highest in almost 90 years. Thompson also equalled the world record for most goals scored in a recognized senior match, set in 1885 when John Petrie scored 13 goals in Arbroath's 36–0 win over Bon Accord in a Scottish Cup tournament. The previous record in a World Cup qualifying match was seven goals and was jointly held by another Australian, Gary Cole, against Fiji in the 1982 World Cup qualification on 14 August 1981, and Iranian Karim Bagheri, against Maldives in the 1998 World Cup qualification on 2 June 1997.|$|E
