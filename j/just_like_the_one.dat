Dazed, Barton wanders onto a beach, still carrying the package. He meets a woman who looks <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> in the picture on his wall at the Earle, and she asks about the box.

500|$|The Shakti {{panel in}} the east shrine is unusual in that {{counting}} Parvati, it features eight mothers (Asta matrikas) {{in an era when}} Sapta matrikas were more common such as at Samalaji and Jogeswari caves. Additionally, the mothers are flanked on one side with Ganesha and the other with Skanda (Kartikeya) when typical artwork from mid 1st millennium show the Shakta mothers with Ganesha and Shiva. According to Sara L. Schastok, the Skanda in the east shrine of Elephanta Cave 1 is significant, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> found in Deogarh Hindu temple site, because he is depicted with regalia, weapons and icons similar to Shiva and because he is surrounded by gods and goddeses. By portraying Skanda with Matrikas, he is equated with the Krittikas legend and thereby Kartikeya, and by showing him so prominently centered the artists are likely communicating the unity of Skanda-Shiva, that all these divinities are in essence the same spiritual concept, [...] "all emanations of the lingam {{at the very heart of}} Elephanta", according to Schastok.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Raúl and Carlos de la Fuente Marcos {{included}} a thirteenth minor planet {{and noted that}} all have their argument of perihelion close to 0°. In a further analysis, Carlos and Raúl de la Fuente Marcos with Sverre J. Aarseth confirmed that the only known way that the observed alignment of the arguments of perihelion can be explained is by an undetected planet. They also theorized that a set of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs) are kept bunched together by a Kozai mechanism {{similar to the one}} between Comet 96P/Machholz and Jupiter. They speculated that it would have a mass between that of Mars and Saturn and would orbit at some [...] from the Sun. However, they also struggled to explain the orbital alignment using a model with only one unknown planet. They therefore suggested that this planet is itself in resonance with a more-massive world about [...] from the Sun, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> predicted in the work by Trujillo and Sheppard. They also did not {{rule out the possibility that}} the planet could have to be much farther away but much more massive in order to have the same effect and admitted the hypothesis needed more work. They also did not rule out other explanations and expected more clarity as researchers study orbits of more such distant objects. A later analysis of the distributions of the directions of perihelia and orbital poles of the ETNOs also suggests that one additional planet may not be sufficient to explain the observed clustering.|$|E

500|$|Kaoru's Reflection OVA series {{version was}} criticized; Efrain Diaz, Jr. of IGN wrote that {{although}} some of Kenshin and Kaoru's private moments are touching, others are depressing. According to Anime News Network's Mike Crandol, Kaoru is the least visually successful character redesign in the Reflection OVA. Citing the manga version's [...] "distinctive girlish charm", Crandol said that the staff members tried too hard to make her look like Yukishiro Tomoe. [...] Don Houston from DVD Talk noted the controversy between the fandom as they refrained from treating Reflection as canon due to how tragic the life of Kaoru and Kenshin's family became. About.com's Serdar Yegulalp felt the romance between Kaoru and Kenshin was entertaining to watch {{but at the same}} time criticized they often acted out of character, commenting on how Kaoru lets her husband leave the house in contrast to how in the original series, Kenshin left Tokyo while still not married with her. Ridwan Khan from Animefringe praised the romance between Kaoru and Kenshin, feeling it was well developed in the OVAs and served as a fitting finale to the series. ABC CBN's Karen Flores praised Emi Takei's portrayal of the character in the first live-action film, stating the actress played her character <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> from the manga and anime. However, she was criticized for lacking her tomboyish traits when interacting with the young Myojin Yahiko. The lack of the love triangle between Kaoru, Kenshin and Takani Megumi was crticized by Ko Ransom from Anime News Network, as the writer noted the first film covered too many subplots. David West from Neo lamented Kaoru had few appearances in the final film, citing her role in the previous ones appealing.|$|E

60|$|It {{was better}} next day, for after walking {{two or three}} hours he came to the end of that yellow plain to higher ground, where the earth was sandy and barren, with a few {{scattered}} bushes growing on it--dark, prickly bushes like butcher's broom. When he got to the highest part of this barren ground he saw a green valley beyond, stretching away {{as far as he could}} see on either hand. But it was nice to see a green place again, and going down into the valley he managed to find some sweet roots to stay his hunger and thirst; then, after a rest, he went on again, and when he got to the top of the high ground beyond the valley, he saw another valley before him, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> he had left behind. Again he rested in that green place, and then slowly went up the high land beyond, where it was barren and sandy with the dark stiff prickly bushes growing here and there, and when he got to the top he looked down, and behold! there was yet another green valley stretching away to the right and left as far as he could see.|$|E
60|$|The {{other day}} he was sent down on an errand to the German Firm {{where many of the}} black boys live. It was very late when he came home on a bright {{moonlight}} night. He had a white bandage round his head, his eyes shone, and he could scarcely speak for excitement. It seems some of the black boys who were his enemies at home had attacked him, and one with a knife. By his own account he had fought very well, but the odds were heavy; the man with the knife had cut him both in the head and back, he had been struck down, and if some of the black boys of his own side had not come to the rescue, he must certainly have been killed. I am sure no Christmas-box could make any of you children so happy as this fight made Arick. A great part of the next day he neglected his work to play upon the one-stringed harp and sing songs about his great victory. And to-day, when he is gone upon his holiday, he has announced that he is going back to the German Firm to have another battle and another triumph. I do not think he will go all the same, or I should be more uneasy, for I do not want to have my Arick killed; and {{there is no doubt that}} if he begins to fight again, he will be likely to go on with it very far. For I have seen him once when he saw, or thought he saw, an enemy. It was one of our dreadful days of rain, the sound of it like a great waterfall or like a tempest of wind blowing in the forest; and there came to our door two runaway black boys seeking work.

60|$|Can {{we get it}} {{from the}} air? Well, {{there are some very}} {{complicated}} and difficult processes by which we can get it from the air; but we have better processes. There is a substance called the black oxide of manganese: it is a very black-looking mineral, but very useful, and when made red-hot it gives out oxygen. Here is an iron bottle which has had some of this substance put into it, and there is a tube fixed to it, and a fire ready made, and Mr. Anderson will put that retort into the fire, for it is made of iron, and can stand the heat. Here is a salt called chlorate of potassa, which is now made in large quantities for bleaching, and chemical and medical uses, and for pyrotechnic and other purposes. I will take some and mix it with some of the oxide of manganese (oxide of copper, or oxide of iron would do as well); and if I put these together in a retort, far less than a red heat is sufficient to evolve this oxygen from the mixture. I am not preparing to make much, because we only want sufficient for our experiments; only, as you will see immediately, if I use too small a charge, the first portion of the gas will be mixed with the air already in the retort, and I should be obliged to sacrifice the first portion of the gas, because it would be so much diluted with air; the first portion must therefore be thrown away. You will find in this case, that a common spirit-lamp is quite sufficient for me to get the oxygen, and so we shall have two processes going on for its preparation. See how freely the gas is coming over from that small portion of the mixture. We will examine it, and see what are its properties. Now, in this way we are producing, as you will observe, a gas <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> we had in the experiment with the battery, transparent, undissolved by water, and presenting the ordinary visible properties of the atmosphere. (As this first jar contains the air, together with the first portions of the oxygen set free during the preparation, we will carry it out of the way, and be prepared to make our experiments in a regular, dignified manner.) And, inasmuch as that power of making wood, wax, or other things burn, was so marked in the oxygen we obtained by means of the voltaic battery from water, we may expect to find the same property here. We will try it You see there is the combustion of a lighted taper in air, and here is its combustion in this gas [lowering the taper into the jar]. See how brightly and how beautifully it burns! You can also see more than this,--you will perceive it is a heavy gas, whilst the hydrogen would go up like a balloon, or even faster than a balloon, when not encumbered with the weight of the envelope.|$|E
