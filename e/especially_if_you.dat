25|$|There {{are limits}} to electrophoretic techniques. Since passing current through a gel causes heating, gels may melt during electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is {{performed}} in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. There are also limitations in determining the molecular weight by SDS-PAGE, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{are trying to find}} the MW of an unknown protein. There are certain biological variables that are difficult or impossible to minimize and can affect the electrophoretic migration. Such factors include protein structure, post-translational modifications, and amino acid composition. For example, tropomyosin is an acidic protein that migrates abnormally on SDS-PAGE gels. This is because the acidic residues are repelled by the negatively charged SDS, leading to an inaccurate mass-to-charge ratio and migration. Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.|$|E

[...] The consideration coming in at close second is your intended quarry. To snipe, dove, quail and open-country sparrows, merlins are best suited. For most blackbirds (Icteridea), either falcon can prove effective. Starlings in close are extremely vulnerable to kestrels; but in the open are best prey for merlins.

The game launched in Japan with 145,000 copies {{sold in the}} first week across both platforms but dropped off Media Create's top 30 list within a month. Critics were most vocal in their praise of the gameplay and battle system. Eurogamer called its innovative design [...] "one of the most inspired approaches to the role-playing video game seen in a decade." [...] IGN stated that [...] "the battle system in Resonance of Fate is strong enough to hold everything together" [...] and added [...] "the unique combat system steps up to be the star of the show." [...] GameSpot noted that [...] "the cinematography used during hero actions is so over-the-top and exciting to watch that it makes battles a joy to take part in." [...] USgamer also lauded the faster pace of the combat system and its emphasis on teamwork to win battles.

500|$|Positive reviews {{praised the}} film for {{presenting}} {{a more realistic}} approach to the Boogeyman and eschewing CGI, {{both of which were}} considered improvements over its predecessor. Its death scenes were highly praised for being extremely violent and gory. Many reviewers also recognized that the film exceeded their expectations despite its direct-to-video status and low budget. Shawn Lealos of CHUD.com gave the film a score of 6.8 out of ten, stating that it was [...] "a very solid little horror flick that forgoes the ridiculous CGI and hokum supernatural aspects of the first movie, as well as the restraints of PG-13." [...] In a similar review, Matthew Stern of PopMatters praised the film in comparison to its predecessor, giving it eight stars out of ten, with a consensus reading: [...] "A film that bucks the stigma of direct-to-DVD sequels, this unyieldingly dark and bloody feature will surprise you, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were unfortunate enough to catch the first one." [...] David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews also praised Boogeyman 2 over the first film, particularly for its [...] "satisfying kill sequences" [...] and an entertaining supporting cast. While he criticized the middle half as [...] "uneventful," [...] he felt that the film [...] "recovers nicely for a surprisingly enthralling third act" [...] and gave it 2.5/4 stars.|$|E

Michael Nelson of Stereogum commented, [...] "This {{is just a}} haunting, hypnotic piece of music that sends chills {{up and down my}} entire skeleton, especially when the tempo shifts downward on the chorus". Nylon writer Liza Darwin deemed the track [...] "silky-smooth" [...] and [...] "total ear candy". Lauren Valenti of Marie Claire lauded the song as [...] "a slice of retro heaven". The track was noted by Stern to be [...] "revolutionary" [...] {{in the sense that it}} sounded [...] "entirely different from anything being offered in pop music at the moment" [...] and deemed it [...] "the very antithesis of everything radio in 2014". Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club named [...] "West Coast" [...] as the album's most accomplished track and [...] "the one song on Ultraviolence that gets the formula of Lana Del Rey right". AltSounds deemed the track as one of Del Rey's best works and one of the best singles released in 2014. The publication went on to opine, [...] "when songs defy descriptions, and artists defy expectation, they tend to stick around long after the 'pop hits' and divas have suck back into obscurity". Oyster journalist Jerico Mandybur commented, [...] "there's no denying that the song has excellent aural pulling power, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like your odes to LA mysterious, darkly surfy and dripping in femme fatale".|$|E
