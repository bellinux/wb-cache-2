40|$|Pyruvate {{carboxylase}} (PC) {{has been}} quantified in rat {{liver and kidney}} cortex under experimental conditions that modify the <b>gluconeogenic</b> <b>response</b> in both organs: fasting, carbon tetrachloride-induced liver degeneration and alloxan-induced diabetes. Enzymatic activity has been assayed by a 14 CO 2 -fixation method. The amount of enzyme has been determined by competitive ELISA using antibodies raised against the purified rat kidney cortex enzyme. Purified fractions of rat-liver and rat-kidney cortex PC {{have been used as}} standards. Fasting and carbon tetrachloride administration induced a significant increase (25 % to 30 %) in the amount of enzyme in liver and kidney cortex. Alloxan-induced diabetes produced a nearly two-fold increase in the hepatic levels of enzyme without a significant modification in the content of the renal enzyme. These results are discussed {{on the basis of the}} different metabolic implications of both organs during the physiological or toxic treatments...|$|E
40|$|Cortisol is a {{steroid hormone}} {{essential}} {{to the maintenance of}} homeostasis that is released in response to stress and low blood glucose concentration. Cortisol is converted from cortisone by 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD 11 B 1). It has been reported that too much cortisol or overexpression of HSD 11 B 1 induces obesity and the insulin resistance that accompanies metabolic syndrome in rodent adipose tissue. In our previous study, HSD 11 B 1 -transgenic (TG) fibroblasts were established, and a porcine model was generated by SCNT using those fibroblasts. Hepatocytes overexpressing HSD 11 B 1 were obtained from livers of this porcine model and cultured in vitro. However, the primary hepatocytes were found to have a short life span or low proliferation rate. To overcome these problems, the SV 40 large T antigen was transduced into primary HSD 11 B 1 -TG hepatocytes, and those cells were immortalized. Immortalized HSD 11 B 1 -TG hepatocytes showed restored morphology, more rapid proliferation rate, and more expression of HSD 11 B 1 than primary hepatocytes. As well, these cells kept the hepatic characteristics such as <b>gluconeogenic</b> <b>response</b> to cortisone and increased expression of hepatic makers. The immortalized HSD 11 B 1 -TG hepatocytes may be useful for studying traits and potential therapeutic drugs for treatment of metabolic disorders induced by overexpression of HSD 11 B 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Hepatic gluconeogenesis tightly {{controls}} {{blood glucose}} levels in healthy individuals, yet disorders of fatty acids (FAs) oxidation {{are characterized by}} hypoglycemia. We studied the ability of free-FAs to directly inhibit gluconeogenesis, as a novel mechanism that elucidates the hypoglycemic effect of FAs oxidation defects. Methods Primary rat hepatocytes were pre-treated with FAs prior to gluconeogenic stimuli with glucagon or dexamethasone and cAMP. Results Pre-treatment with 1 [*]mM FAs (mixture of 2 : 1 oleate:palmitate) for 1 hour prior to gluconeogenic induction, significantly decreases the induced expression of the gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose- 6 -phosphatase (G 6 pase) {{as well as the}} induced glucose production by the cells. The inhibitory effect of FAs upon gluconeogenesis is abolished when pre-treatment is elongated to 18 hours, allowing clearance of FAs into triglycerides by the cells. Replacement of palmitate with the non-metabolic fatty acid 2 -bromopalmitate inhibits esterification of FAs into triglycerides. Accordingly, the increased exposure to unesterified-FAs allows their inhibitory effect to be extended even when pre-treatment is elongated to 18 hours. Similar changes were caused by FAs to the induction of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1 α (PGC 1 α) expression, indicating this transcriptional coactivator as the mediating link of the effect. This inhibitory effect of FAs upon gluconeogenic induction is shown to involve reduced activation of cAMP response element-binding (CREB) transcription factor. Conclusions The present results demonstrate that free-FAs directly inhibit the induced <b>gluconeogenic</b> <b>response</b> in hepatocytes. Hence, high levels of free-FAs may attenuate hepatic gluconeogenesis, and liver glucose output. </p...|$|E
40|$|Iron plays a {{critical}} role as an oxygen carrier in hemoglobin {{as well as a}} constituent of iron-sulfur clusters. Increasing evidence suggests that mechanisms maintaining iron homeostasis cross-talk to intermediary metabolism. The liver hormone hepcidin is the key regulator of systemic iron metabolism. Hepcidin transcriptional control is linked to the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway, proliferative signals, <b>gluconeogenic</b> <b>responses</b> during starvation and hormones that modulate energy metabolism. The aim of my PhD project was to investigate links between hepcidin regulation and cellular metabolism. My work describes {{for the first time that}} citrate metabolism controls hepcidin expression. A previously reported genome-wide RNAi screen generated a first comprehensive atlas of hepatocytic hepcidin regulators. To study metabolic signals that control hepcidin expression, I selected putative hepcidin regulators from the screening data, noting that several are specifically involved in citrate metabolism. I show that the siRNA-mediated knockdown of the enzymes that catalyze citrateconsuming reactions ACO 1 (cytosolic aconitase), ACO 2 (mitochondrial aconitase) and ACLY (ATP citrate lyase), as well as the inhibition of their enzymatic activities by small molecules, increases hepcidin mRNA expression in primary murine hepatocytes (PMH). Treatment of PMH with citrate furthermore results in the increase of citrate in cells and increased hepcidin expression. I further demonstrate that citrate acts intracellularly to regulate hepcidin via the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway. Injection of citrate into the tail vein of mice supports my findings that citrate increase in the liver augments hepcidin expression as well as the activity of BMP/SMAD signaling also in vivo. All together, my results uncover the cross-talk between iron homeostasis and intermediary metabolism, and may help to explain why iron levels are altered in several metabolic disorders...|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the acute effect of the thyroid hormone 3, 5, 3 '-tri-iodo-L-thyronine (T 3) in regulating the hepatic metabolism either directly or by controlling the responsiveness to Ca 2 +-mobilizing agonists. We did not detect any acute metabolic effect of T 3 either in perfused liver or in isolated liver cells. However, T 3 exerted a powerful inhibitory effect on the alpha 1 -adrenoreceptor-mediated responses. The promptness of this T 3 effect rules {{out that it was}} the result of rate changes in gene(s) transcription. T 3 inhibited the alpha 1 -adrenoreceptor-mediated sustained stimulation of respiration and release of Ca 2 + and H+, but not the glycogenolytic or <b>gluconeogenic</b> <b>responses,</b> in perfused liver. In isolated liver cells, T 3 enhanced the alpha 1 -agonist-induced increase in cytosolic free Ca 2 + and impeded the intracellular alkalinization. Since T 3 also prevented the alpha 1 -adrenoreceptor-mediated activation of protein kinase C, its effects on pH seem {{to be the result of}} a lack of activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger. The failure of T 3 to prevent the alpha 1 -adrenergic stimulation of gluconeogenesis despite the inhibition of protein kinase C activation indicates that the elevation of cytosolic free Ca 2 + is a sufficient signal to elicit that response. T 3 also impaired some of the angiotensin-II-mediated responses, but did not alter the effects of PMA on hepatic metabolism, indicating, therefore, that some postreceptor event is the target for T 3 actions. The differential effect of T 3 in enhancing the alpha 1 -adrenoreceptor-mediated increase in cytosolic free Ca 2 + and preventing the activation of protein kinase C, provides a unique tool for further investigating the role of each branch of the signalling pathway in controlling the hepatic functions. Moreover, the low effective concentrations of T 3 (<= 10 nM) in perturbing the alpha 1 -adrenoreceptor-mediated response suggests its physiological significance...|$|R
40|$|Many guanide-containing {{drugs are}} antihyperglycaemic but most exhibit toxicity, {{to the extent}} that only the {{biguanide}} metformin has enjoyed sustained clinical use. Here, we have isolated unique mitochondrial redox control properties of metformin that are likely to account for this difference. In primary hepatocytes and H 4 IIE hepatoma cells we found that antihyperglycaemic diguanides DG 5 -DG 10 and the biguanide phenformin were up to 1000 -fold more potent than metformin on cell signalling <b>responses,</b> <b>gluconeogenic</b> promoter expression and hepatocyte glucose production. Each drug inhibited cellular oxygen consumption similarly but there were marked differences in other respects. All diguanides and phenformin but not metformin inhibited NADH oxidation in submitochondrial particles, indicative of complex I inhibition, which also corresponded closely with dehydrogenase activity in living cells measured by WST- 1. Consistent with these findings, in isolated mitochondria, DG 8 but not metformin caused the NADH/NAD+ couple to become more reduced over time and mitochondrial deterioration ensued, suggesting direct inhibition of complex I and mitochondrial toxicity of DG 8. In contrast, metformin exerted a selective oxidation of the mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ couple, without triggering mitochondrial deterioration. Together, our results suggest that metformin suppresses energy transduction by selectively inducing a state in complex I where redox and proton transfer domains are no longer efficiently coupled.

40|$|While {{the natural}} niches {{of the soil}} {{bacterium}} Pseudomonas putida are unlikely to include significant amounts of free glycerol as a growth substrate, this bacterium is genetically equipped with the functions required for its metabolism. We have resorted to deep sequencing of the transcripts in glycerol-grown P. putidaKT 2440 cells to gain an insight into the biochemical and regulatory components involved in the shift between customary C sources (e. g. glucose or succinate) to the polyol. Transcriptomic results were contrasted with key enzymatic activities under the same culture conditions. Cognate expression profiles revealed that genes encoding enzymes of the Entner-Doudoroff route and other catabolic pathways, e. g. the gluconate and 2 -ketogluconate loops, were significantly downregulated on glycerol. Yet, the compound simultaneously elicited a <b>gluconeogenic</b> <b>response</b> that indicated an efficient channelling of C skeletons back to biomass build-up through the glyoxylate shunt rather than energization of the cells through downwards pathways, i. e. tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The simultaneous glycolytic and gluconeogenic metabolic regimes on glycerol, paradoxical as they seem, make sense from an ecological point of view by favouring prevalence versus exploration. This metabolic situation {{was accompanied by a}} considerably low expression of stress markers as compared with other C sources. © 2013 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

40|$|In {{a series}} of four experiments, {{asparaginase}} and glutaminase activity was measured in liver and kidney tissue of 7 - to 19 -day-old male broiler chicks. In Experiment 1, chicks were fed purified amino acid diets with 14. 8 and 44. 6 % protein equivalents (PE) with 1, 3, or 5 % added sodium bicarbonate. In Experiments 2, 3, and 4 the chicks were fed a 23 % protein basal control diet, basal diet containing 5 % ammonium chloride, and basal diet containing 5 % ammonium chloride with 5 or 10 % sodium bicarbonate, asparagine, or glutamine. In Experiments 2 and 4 the chicks were also fed 25, 50, or 75 % protein-isolated soy-purified diets. The 44. 6 % PE diet increased liver and kidney asparaginase activity in chicks as compared to chicks fed a 14. 8 % PE diet. The addition of sodium bicarbonate to the 44. 6 % PE amino acid diet decreased the kidney asparaginase activity equivalent to kidney asparaginase activity of chicks fed the 14. 8 % PE diet. Asparaginase activity increased 4 -fold in the kidneys of chicks fed the 23 % protein basal diet containing 5 % ammonium chloride and the pH of the urine from the chicks was 4. 9. Chicks fed basal diets with 5 % ammonium chloride plus 10 % sodium bicarbonate or asparagine had the same kidney asparaginase activity and urine pH as chicks fed the 23 % protein basal control diet. Glutamine added to chick diets containing 5 % ammonium chloride did not decrease the kidney asparaginase activity or the urine acidity. Liver asparaginase activity was not increased in acidotic chicks fed diets with 5 % ammonium chloride. The asparaginase activity of liver and kidney tissue were both significantly increased in chicks fed 75 % protein-isolated soy purified diets and the pH of their urine was 5. 6. The increase in liver asparaginase of chicks fed 75 % protein or 44. 5 % PE diets was probably due to an endocrine <b>gluconeogenic</b> <b>response</b> producing increased catabolism {{of the majority of}} amino acids. The increase in kidney asparaginase of chicks fed 75 % protein, 44. 5 % PE diets, and 23 % protein basal diets with 5 % ammonium chloride was primarily related to metabolic acidosis. Phosphate-dependent glutaminase (PDG) activity was localized in chick kidney mitochondria and was heat sensitive (55 C for 30 sec). The phosphate-independent glutaminase (PIG) activity was primarily localized in chick kidney mitochondria but was stable to a temperature of 55 C for 30 sec. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{molecular}} mechanisms that determine the beneficial metabolic response to physical exercise may open up new therapeutic options {{to prevent and}} improve Type 2 Diabetes and related metabolic disorders. The focus of this thesis was on the liver as the main regulator of energy homeostasis and on interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) because it is released from the working muscle and could signal directly to the liver. A single bout of non-exhaustive endurance exercise caused a rapid and strong transcriptional response of several key regulators of glucose and fatty acid {{metabolism in the liver}} of mice that was more pronounced than in the working muscle at this early time point. The amount of insulin receptor substrate- 2 protein was increased and insulin signalling, induced by glucose-stimulated endogenous insulin secretion, was amplified. Different stress-responsive pathways were transiently activated in the liver, most notably, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling, as evidenced by the increased phosphorylation of c-Jun terminal kinase and an extracellular signal related kinase isoform and induction of MAPK target genes. IL- 6 -type cytokine signalling and p 53 were also activated. Exercise-induced oxidative stress was not the stimulus for the hepatic stress response, because it could not be blocked by an antioxidant-enriched diet. It could, however, be linked directly or indirectly to the fall in plasma glucose, since the levels of hepatic gene expression correlated to glucose concentrations after the bout of exercise. Activation of AMPK and the depletion of hepatic glycogen confirmed that the exercising liver experienced acute energetic stress. IL- 6 -deficient (IL- 6 -/-) mice showed reduced endurance capacity, which might be caused by impaired activation of IL- 6 -dependent pathways resulting in reduced energy supply during exercise. However, plasma glucose, insulin and free fatty acid (FFA) levels and the decrease of hepatic glycogen were similar in exercised IL- 6 -/- and wildtype mice and the induction of gluconeogenic enzymes and other metabolic regulators studied was not impaired. The <b>gluconeogenic</b> <b>response</b> to fasting was also intact in IL- 6 -/- mice. Training-associated adaptations to regular physical activity, the improvement of glucose disposal and the relative increase in exercise endurance by four weeks of training, were also similar in the IL- 6 -/- mice. In contrast, IL- 6 -/- mice had a mild metabolic phenotype in the sedentary, fed state. The lack of IL- 6 in the liver appeared to cause a weaker suppression of glucose production in response to insulin, leading to higher glucose and insulin and lower FFA levels. On the other hand, the IL- 6 -/- mice in our study had a persistently lower weight gain, accompanied by a slightly improved glucose tolerance. To conclude, the results from this thesis reveal that the liver responds intensely and acutely to physical exercise and that IL- 6 is not essential for this acute metabolic response of the liver. Ein besseres Verständnis der molekularen Mechanismen, welche die positive metabolische Anpassung an Sport vermitteln, kann dazu beitragen, neue therapeutische Optionen zur Prävention und Therapie von Typ- 2 -Diabetes zu entwickeln.

40|$|Following {{hepatic injury}} or stress, <b>gluconeogenic</b> and acute-phase <b>response</b> genes are rapidly {{upregulated}} to restore metabolic homeostasis and limit tissue damage. Regulation of the liver-restricted insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP- 1) gene is dramatically altered {{by changes in}} the metabolic state and hepatectomy, and thus it provided an appropriate reporter to assess the transcriptional milieu in the liver during repair and regeneration. The cytokine interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) is required for liver regeneration and repair, and it transcriptionally upregulates {{a vast array of}} genes during liver growth by unknown mechanisms. Evidence for a biologic role of IL- 6 in IGFBP- 1 upregulation was demonstrated by increased expression of hepatic IGFBP- 1 in IL- 6 transgenic and following injection of IL- 6 into nonfasting animals and its reduced expression in IL- 6 −/− livers posthepatectomy. In both hepatic and nonhepatic cells, IL- 6 -mediated IGFBP- 1 promoter activation was via an intact hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF- 1) site and was dependent on the presence of endogenous liver factor HNF- 1 and induced factors STAT 3 and AP- 1 (c-Fos/c-Jun). IL- 6 acted through the STAT 3 pathway, as dominant negative STAT 3 completely blocked IL- 6 -mediated stimulation of the IGFBP- 1 promoter via the HNF- 1 site. HNF- 1 /c-Fos and HNF- 1 /STAT 3 protein complexes were detected in mouse livers and in hepatic and nonhepatic cell lines overexpressing STAT 3 /c-Fos/HNF- 1. Similar regulation was demonstrated using glucose- 6 -phosphatase and α-fibrinogen promoters, indicating that HNF- 1 /IL- 6 /STAT 3 /AP- 1 -mediated transactivation of hepatic gene expression is a general phenomenon after liver injury. These results demonstrate that the two classes of transcription factors, growth induced (STAT 3 and AP- 1) and tissue specific (HNF- 1), can interact as an adaptive response to liver injury to amplify expression of hepatic genes important for the homeostatic response during organ repair...|$|R
40|$|Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is {{a heterogeneous}} disorder encompassing reproductive and metabolic phenotypes. Genetic analysis, targeting candidate genes has to date proven unsuccessful {{in the search}} for a truly dominant genetic link. Another hypothesis to explain the etiology of PCOS is that of fetal programming in the context of developmental origins of health and disease. Extensive animal studies, validated by human data, support the fetal origins hypothesis of PCOS and highlight that PCOS may arise due to excess androgen exposure in fetal life. Previous reports from our laboratory found metabolic dysfunction in 11 month old prenatally androgenised females (d 62 - 102 of fetal life), which included pancreatic and hepatic alterations. The pancreatic alterations seemed to result from gene expression changes induced in fetal life. Therefore, chapter 3 focuses on the <b>gluconeogenic</b> <b>response</b> in the day 90 fetus following maternal androgenisation from day 62 of gestation. Interestingly hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes, specifically phosphoenolpyruvate caboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose 6 phosphatase (G 6 PC), were not altered. However they were decreased in the kidney, in a sex specific manner with PEPCK significantly decreased (P< 0. 01) and G 6 PC showing a strong trend toward reduction (P= 0. 056) in females only. This chapter progresses to explore regulatory pathways involved in gluconeogenic regulation. It seems probable that the female specific increase in circulating testosterone (P< 0. 001), with increased renal androgen reception (P< 0. 01), may be accountable for the altered expression of gluconeogenic enzymes in the kidney. Chapter 4 investigates why testosterone concentrations were not increased in the male fetus, after maternal androgenisation, by focusing on the site of testosterone production, the fetal testis. Results demonstrate that the day 90 fetus is capable of responding to prenatal androgenisation by decreasing luteinising hormone (P< 0. 01) and thus testicular testosterone production, such that there was a global down regulation in steroidogenic enzyme expression, in vivo testosterone production (P< 0. 001) and Leydig cell morphology was altered (P< 0. 001). As prenatal androgenisation is administered through the maternal route and placental aromatisation may occur, a novel method whereby the fetus was directly injected was utilised to assess the effects of control oil (C), testosterone (TP) or diethylstilboestrol (DES) on the fetal testis. Unlike DES, direct fetal injection with TP mimics the results found from maternal androgenisation. When the testis are examined at a later date, day 112, ten days after androgen treatment ceases, Leydig cell morphology and steroidogenic gene expression return to control values, although fascinatingly, an overshoot of in vivo testosterone production (P< 0. 01) was observed. When the maternal androgenisation window is extended to begin at day 30 of fetal life, further changes are noted including increased circulating testosterone (P< 0. 01), a strong trend toward decreased testis weight (P= 0. 0519) and altered expression of Sertoli and germ cell specific markers. These studies are followed up by assessing the legacy effect of testosterone on the peripubertal male testis in Chapter 5. At ten weeks of postnatal life, males, exposed to androgens from day 62 - 102 of fetal life had reduced testis weight (P< 0. 05). However, functional or cellular alterations were not observed and by 12 weeks of age, when LH had normalised, testicular weight and stimulated testosterone secretion of prenatally TP-treated males was comparable to controls. This highlights the remarkable plasticity of the testis and the unremarkable legacy of altered prenatal androgen exposure. The legacy effect of testosterone on the fetal ovary is examined in Chapter 6. Previous studies from our laboratory found minor functional alterations but no structural alterations in the fetal ovary at day 90 following androgenisation from day 62. However, as this was at a time of a highly androgenic environment we assessed the function and morphology of the ovary ten days after the removal of testosterone at day 112. In marked contrast to the normalisation of the male gonad, we observe structural changes with an increase in recruited follicles from the primordial to primary stage in the testosterone treated group (P< 0. 01). The chapter continues with an investigation of pathways involved in the altered follicular dynamics that may account for the change in follicular recruitment. Furthermore, the functional changes which were previously noted in the day 90 ovary were also examined in response to direct exogenous steroid treatment including, C, TP, DES and dexamethasone (DEX) and also when the window of maternal androgenisation was extended to begin at day 30. Interesting changes are observed such that the direct fetal injection treatments induce similar changes to each other, regardless of the steroid, whilst maternal androgenisation induces a different response. This highlights the complexity of the pathways involved in female gonadal development...|$|E
