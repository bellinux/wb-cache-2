40|$|The faxes sent and {{received}} during one week {{by a small}} Finnish company involved in international operations were analyzed {{to determine whether or}} not the business fax contains distinct features that warrant classifying it as a genre.

Five specific subgenres of the business fax &mdash; identified as specific information, specific requests, "for your information, " first contact, and order &mdash; were also found.
