500|$|Blink-182 was the band's first {{release on}} Geffen, which absorbed sister label MCA Records in 2003. Prior to it dissolving, MCA had {{attempted}} to penalize the band for breaking stipulations in their contract {{that they would have}} an album out by a specific quarter. MCA had previously rushed the band into recording Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, but the band had much more freedom with Geffen. [...] "Geffen came down and heard three songs and they said, 'This is the best record you've ever done, this is the record of your career, take as much time as you want, call us when it's done.' It just completely outlined the perspective of putting accounting before creative, and when you're in the entertainment business, you've got to put creative first. It's an art, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it like an art, treat it like an art, and then you'll get the best product in the long run." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wow! but {{it feels}} good to know I haven't <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a grammar or an algebra for the next few weeks," [...] cried Randy, with satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} I should 'ave such a thing, upon my word I don't. I've never 'ad a day's illness in my life. You've only <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{me to know}} that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{lay still}} afterward, and I thought he'd gone to sleep. Then the cabin {{seemed to grow}} strangely quiet, and when I <b>got</b> up <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him I {{saw that he was}} dead." ...|$|R
60|$|But my eyes fell on a {{calabash}} {{that hung}} {{against the wall}} over the table, and I <b>got</b> up <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. I had been hunting for an old one and this was better than any I had seen outside the museum.|$|R
50|$|And {{before the}} {{lightning}} fades and you surrender,:You've <b>got</b> a second <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the dark side}} of the man.|$|R
6000|$|Dane laughed softly. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "tastes differ, and {{the girl}} is pretty, while you know, after all, they're very much the same. We have, however, <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the thing sensibly, and you admit you can't deny it." ...|$|E
60|$|By restoration--judicious restoration, as Mr. Murray usually {{calls it}} --there is no saying {{how much you}} have lost, Putting the {{question}} of restoration out of your mind, however, for a while, think where you are, {{and what you have}} <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{all very}} well," [...] he said, [...] "but I {{think you really}} have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your children's future from a larger point of view. You don't surely want them to fly out against things before they've {{had a chance to}} see life for themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"No matter," [...] he said. [...] "I am {{satisfied}} [...] . nearly. I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> only <b>at</b> {{the face}} of the first man that comes along, to regain my confidence. They can't be made to understand {{what is going on in}} me. What of that? Come! I haven't done so badly." ...|$|R
6000|$|As Sissy said it, {{her eyes}} were {{attracted}} by another of those rotten fragments of fence upon the ground. She <b>got</b> up <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. 'And yet I don't know. This has not been broken very long. The wood is quite fresh where it gave way. Here are footsteps too. - O Rachael!' ...|$|R
60|$|One morning, a {{few weeks}} after the night of the storm, Maggot the smith turned himself in his bed at an early hour, and, feeling disinclined <b>to</b> slumber, <b>got</b> up <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the state of the weather. The sun was just rising, and there was an {{inviting}} look about the morning which induced the man to dress hastily and go out.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{looked at}} the revolver,' said Joe, telling me; 'it was about {{eighteen}} inches off my nose; and then I {{looked at the}} gal. There's lots of 'em will threaten to blow your brains out for you, but you've only <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> 'em to know they won't.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{regard it}} in that light, Sarah, she'll {{get the better of}} you. If she marries him she will be lost; that is the way you have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. It is her future {{happiness}} you must think of--and respectability. She is a headstrong young woman, and has to be treated accordingly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was those}} Kay's men," [...] he said. [...] "What {{does it matter}} about {{evidence}}? You've only <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> 'em. That's all the evidence you want. The only thing that makes it at all puzzling is that they did nothing worse. You'd naturally expect them to slay the sentry, at any rate." ...|$|E
6000|$|The little priest bounded like {{a rabbit}} shot. [...] "Come on!" [...] he cried in quite unusual excitement. [...] "Come on! We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that policeman!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'When {{we are at}} work at a distance, {{dinner is}} brought out, {{and there is an}} hour and a half of rest; and on Sunday we may walk about the yards. You should have seen one of our gang, when I <b>got</b> him <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the chevaux de frise round a bud, how he owned it was a regular patent invention; it just {{answered}} to Paley's illustration.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I knowed the parting {{would come}} hard, children—I knowed it would!” said Natty, “and so I <b>got</b> aside <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the graves by myself, and thought if I left ye the keep sake which the Major gave me, {{when we first}} parted in the woods, ye wouldn’t take it unkind, but would know that, let the old man’s body go where it might, his {{feelings}} stayed behind him.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "People like Sam Clark and Harry Haydock aren't earnest {{about music}} and {{pictures}} and eloquent sermons and really refined movies, but then, {{on the other}} hand, people like Carol Kennicott put too much stress on all this art. Folks ought to appreciate lovely things, but just the same, they got to be practical and--they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> things in a practical way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Horrible as you please, {{but less}} so than {{going on in}} this way; I haven't told you the fiftieth part--you will easily {{understand}} that I can't. They are not nice things to say to a girl like you--especially about Deepmere, if you didn't know it. But when they happen you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them, haven't you? That's the way I look at it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{you never}} been in love?" [...] Evelyn asked. [...] "Oh no--one's only <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you to see that," [...] she added. She considered. [...] "I really was in love once," [...] she said. She fell into reflection, her eyes losing their bright {{vitality}} and approaching something like an expression of tenderness. [...] "It was heavenly!--while it lasted. The worst of it is it don't last, not with me. That's the bother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh. This was curious: When I {{took off}} my dress last night--it was a darling dress, I loved it so, {{but of course the}} mud had spoiled it. I cried over it and----No matter. But my white silk {{stockings}} were all torn, and the strange thing is, I don't know whether I caught my legs in the briers when I <b>got</b> out <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the sign-post, or whether Cy scratched me when I was fighting him off." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{carried him}} in and warmed him at the fire, {{but it was too}} late. He had been drunk once too often. When I saw that he was dead, I stowed him away in the nest he had been seeking when he fell out into the snow. I tried to read; but the book seemed dull. Every little while I <b>got</b> up <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, lying there with his little pointed face, still dead. At last I wrapped him up, and pushed him farther in, out of sight.|$|R
60|$|The Picture, elegantly framed, came {{safely to}} hand soon after Mr. Elton's return, and being {{hung over the}} mantelpiece of the common sitting-room, he <b>got</b> up <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, and sighed out his half {{sentences}} of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, boys," [...] Harry Wade {{began after}} they had smoked for some time in silence, [...] "we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this matter squarely. So far we have got out of a mighty tight place better than we expected. Yesterday it seemed to us that there weren't much chance of our {{carrying}} our hair away, but now {{we are out of}} that scrape. But we are in another pretty nigh as bad, though there ain't much chance of the red-skins getting at us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't wonder you're {{afraid of}} the women after that," [...] said the major, laughing. [...] "There are plenty of good women in the world, though, {{if you have the}} luck to come across them. D'ye know a young fellow called Dimsdale--? Ah, you wouldn't, but I've met him lately at the club. He's got a girl who's the adopted {{daughter}} of that same ould Girdlestone that we talk about. I saw the two of them togither one day as happy as a pair of young love birds. Sure, you've only <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her face to see that she's as good as gold. I'll bet that that woman over the strate there is another of the right sort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you know, Mr. Mawmsey, {{you would}} find it {{the right thing to}} put {{yourself}} on our side. This Reform will touch everybody by-and-by--a thoroughly popular measure--a sort of A, B, C, you know, that must come first before the rest can follow. I quite agree with you that you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the thing in a family light: but public spirit, now. We're all one family, you know--it's all one cupboard. Such a thing as a vote, now: why, it may help to make men's fortunes at the Cape--there's no knowing what may be the effect of a vote," [...] Mr. Brooke ended, with a sense of being a little out at sea, though finding it still enjoyable. But Mr. Mawmsey answered in a tone of decisive check.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{head of the}} {{bedstead}} was {{set against}} the wall which divided his room from mine. From <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the bedstead I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the wall next. Then to wondering what it was made of. Then to rapping against it with my knuckles. The sound told me {{there was nothing but}} lath and plaster under the paper. It was the same as the wall we had been at work on down stairs. We had cleared our way so far through this last--in certain places where the repairs were most needed--that we had {{to be careful not to}} burst through the paper in the room on the other side. I found myself calling to mind the caution my husband had given me while we were at this part of the work, word for word as he had spoken it. 'Take care you don't find your hands in the next room.' That was what he had said down in the parlor. Up in his bedroom I kept on repeating it in my own mind--with my eyes all the while on the key, which he had moved to the inner side of the door to lock himself in--till the knowledge of what it meant burst on me like a flash of light. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the wall, at the bedhead, at my own two hands--and I shivered as if it was winter time.|$|R
50|$|The {{summer after}} their second year, she and two classmates <b>got</b> a {{fellowship}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the World Bank's presence in Thailand and Burma. But Ka Hsaw Wa {{told them the}} real story was the Yadana Pipeline, being built by French company Total S.A. and Unocal, which is headquartered in El Segundo, CA. The 39-mile natural gas line cuts through the Burmese jungle to the Thai border.|$|R
60|$|Of course I hated and dreaded it all, and it {{was only}} by that power which made it so hard to say nay to Harold, that he <b>got</b> me down <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the very lair of the Hydriot Company. It was a melancholy place; the {{buildings}} were so much larger, and the apparatus so much more elaborate than there was any use for; and there were so few workmen, and those so unhealthy and sinister-looking.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are right}} there, lad. You see I {{was brought up}} a Jacobite, and I have been a soldier all my life, {{accustomed}} to charge when I was told to charge and to kill those I was told to kill; but I own that since I have been out now I have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> matters differently. The sight of all these poor Highland bodies blindly following their chiefs and risking life and all for a cause {{in which they have}} no shadow of interest has made me think. A soldier is a soldier, and if he were to sit down to argue about the justice of every cause in which he is ordered to fight there would be an end to all discipline. But these poor fellows are not soldiers, and so I say to myself, What concern have they in this matter? Their chiefs would gain honours and rewards, patents of high nobility, and additions to their estates if the Stuarts conquered, but their followers would gain nothing whatever. No, lad, if we get over this scrape I have done with fighting; and I hope that no Stuart will ever again succeed in getting Scotland to take up his cause. I shall go on fighting for Prince Charles {{as long as there is}} a man left with him; but after that there is an end of it as far as I am concerned, and I hope as far as Scotland is concerned." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 30 June Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn {{wrote to}} Theresa May {{to say that}} the inquiry's terms should be broad, because the fire had [...] "much wider {{implications}} for national policy issues".Former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said that [...] "The inquiry has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> how regulatory regime developed, or I think the residents would feel they were let down." ...|$|E
5000|$|McCosker {{was unsure}} whether to keep playing. [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the {{business}} scene {{and the home}} front before I tell the selectors I'm available to play and perhaps take on the leadership again," [...] he said in June 1983. [...] "Leadership is a demanding task {{and the amount of}} time spent away from home and business at this time of my life can present long term problems." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2012, TTC CEO Andy Byford stated {{there is}} great need for {{additional}} subway capacity with the increasing population of Toronto, and capacity issues along Line 1 Yonge–University: [...] "The downtown relief line has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> and has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be talked about right now." [...] Metrolinx officials stated that capacity issues may allow the DRL to be given higher priority in the regional transportation plan, The Big Move. Metrolinx CEO Bruce McCuaig stressed that the Downtown Relief Line should be prioritized and completed in 15 years, as part of Metrolinx's [...] "next wave" [...] of projects in The Big Move transit expansion plan. In February 2013, the Metrolinx Board approved changes to The Big Move that re-prioritized the eastern segment of the Relief Line to the 15-year plan, and made {{it one of the}} 15 top priority projects in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area.|$|R
