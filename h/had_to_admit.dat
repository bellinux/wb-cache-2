5|$|During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia {{responded to}} this by {{suggesting}} that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> to that there was no case law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal to do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E

Six {{out of his}} 17 Test hundreds, and four out of his six ODI hundreds came against Australia. He has two double-centuries in Tests, both against Australia: his personal best of 281 at Kolkata in 2000–01, and 200 not out at Feroz Shah Kotla in 2008–09. and The Australians <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> {{that they did not}} know where to bowl to him.|$|E

25|$|A {{feature film}} version of the serial was shot in eleven days in December 1973 in colour on 16mm film and then blown up to 35mm. The film {{features}} nearly all the show's regular cast {{as well as more}} revealing nudity than was allowed on TV at the time. A gay kiss between Don and Simon was mysteriously cut from the movie after its Sydney season. Critics were not kind but even Mike Harris from The Australian <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> he had never been in a cinema before where every character's first appearance got a roar of approval from the crowd.|$|E
25|$|Peters was {{recalled}} to Berlin {{and employed}} in the Imperial Colonial Office from 1893 to 1895, while official accusations were brought against him of excesses in regard to his treatment of the native population. In a session of the Reichstag on 13 March 1896 August Bebel, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, finally made the killings public, citing from a self-exculpatory letter by Peters to Bishop Alfred Tucker. Peters denied {{the authenticity of the}} letter but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the executions. After three investigations he was, during 1897, dishonorably deprived of his commission for misuse of official power, losing all his pension benefits.|$|E

25|$|In 1917 Switzerland's {{neutrality}} {{came into}} question when the Grimm–Hoffmann Affair erupted. Robert Grimm, a Swiss socialist politician, travelled to Russia as an activist {{to negotiate a}} separate peace between Russia and Germany, in order {{to end the war}} on the Eastern Front in the interests of socialism and pacifism. Misrepresenting himself as a diplomat and an actual representative of the Swiss government, he made progress but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> to fraud and return home when the Allies found out about the proposed peace deal. Neutrality was restored by the resignation of Arthur Hoffmann, the Swiss Federal Councillor who had supported Grimm but had not consulted his colleagues on the initiative.|$|E
25|$|Morpurgo {{tried to}} adapt the book into a film screenplay, working for over five years with Simon Channing-Williams, {{but in the end}} they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> defeat. The book was {{successfully}} adapted for a stage play by Nick Stafford in 2007. To work dramatically, the story could not be told solely through the horse's viewpoint (as it was in the book), and so the film version with a screenplay by Richard Curtis and Lee Hall is based on the narrative approach of the stage play more than that of the book. Unlike the play, which used puppet horses, the film uses a combination of real horses, animatronic horses and computer-generated imagery.|$|E
25|$|On 8 August 1940, during another dogfight, 14 Gladiators of 80 Squadron took 16 Fiat CR.42s from 9° and 10° Gruppi of 4° Stormo (a Regia Aeronautica elite unit) by {{surprise}} over Gabr Saleh, well inside Italian territory. British pilots claimed 13 to 16 confirmed victories {{and one to}} seven probables, while losing two Gladiators. That battle highlighted the strong points of the Gladiator over the CR.42, especially the radio equipment, which had permitted a coordinated attack, being also crucial for obtaining the initial surprise, and the Gladiator's superior low-altitude overall performance, including speed and a markedly superior horizontal manoeuvrability over its Italian opponent. The British celebrated the victory, while the Italians <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> a hard defeat.|$|E

25|$|Heinz Heydrich {{had five}} children. His oldest, Peter Thomas Heydrich (1931–2000), was a {{well-known}} German cabaret singer, {{and wrote a}} book about his childhood, father, and uncle. In the book, Peter Heydrich describes how, as a youth, he enjoyed the fame of being a “crown prince,” the nephew of Reinhard Heydrich. During boyhood, he thought of his uncle as a successful sportsman and a sensitive musician. In Prague, Peter observed that his uncle had become a “high animal.” Peter derived many privileges from being Reinhard Heydrich’s nephew. Even after the war, Peter still felt some pride in the familial relationship, if not so openly. But finally, Peter Heydrich <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that Reinhard Heydrich was a protean schemer, who planned and executed the Holocaust and other crimes. Peter died on 22 November 2000, after a long illness.|$|E
25|$|Initially it {{was thought}} by Siemens and VAG that development, testing and {{certification}} of the ATC components could be conducted during those 3 years in parallel {{to the construction of}} the line, at first in simulations and, after the first DT3 units had been delivered, on a test track at the Langwasser Depot, and that the new line could enter service immediately after the tunnels and stations were built. However, in 2005 news was published that ATC development was not progressing as planned and that the opening would have to be postponed by one year to late 2006 or early 2007. In fall 2006 the responsible parties <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that the ATC system would still not be ready by the already postponed date at the end of 2006 and that the opening of the line would have to be postponed again. At that point, Siemens appointed a new project manager. The new U3 line finally opened on June 14, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Five {{days after}} the wedding, Jim {{received}} his draft notice. He was sent to France and became part of a military touring group that entertained the armed forces after World War I. When Jim came home from France, he and Marian decided to try their luck with a vaudeville act. They had two children, Kathryn Therese Jordan (1920–2007) and James Carroll Jordan (1923–1998), both born in Peoria. Marian returned home {{for the birth of}} Kathryn but went back to performing with Jim, leaving her daughter with Jim's parents. After Jim Jr. was born in 1923, Marian stayed with the children for a time, while Jim performed as a solo act. Marian and the children joined him on the road for a short time, but the couple <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> defeat when they found themselves in Lincoln, Illinois in 1923 with two small children and no funds. The couple's parents had to wire them money for their return to Peoria. Jim went to work at a local department store but still felt the attraction of being in show business. He and Marian went back into vaudeville.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{preserving}} the sites of the Pajarito Plateau proved difficult and time-consuming, partly because interactions among the affected parties were complex, and partly because when Roosevelt passed the reins of government to William Howard Taft, enthusiasm in the White House for preserving such sites was diminished. Another factor {{had to do with}} Hewett's own personality. He had many supporters, but also many critics, and some of the latter complained that his real goal was to ensure that he, Edgar L. Hewett, D.Sc., Director of the School of American Research, would have access to, and control of, the Plateau's sites—while his rivals would not. Negotiations over a new monument were long and contentious, but finally, on February 11, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the new Bandelier National Monument, naming it for Adolph Bandelier who had died recently. The monument was rather smaller than Hewett had hoped, covering only Frijoles Canyon, some comparatively empty land to the southwest, and an outlier (now Tsankawi), and omitting among others the very significant Puye Cliff Dwellings near Santa Clara Pueblo. However, even the most ardent preservationists <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that, from the standpoint of protecting Puebloan sites, Bandelier was much better than nothing.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the Ottoman {{invasion}} was {{not considered}} as a significant threat by both Bulgarians and Byzantines. For only one decade between 1354 and 1364 the Ottomans conquered virtually the whole of Thrace seizing large cities such as Plovdiv, Beroia, Dianopolis (Yambol) and Adrianople and defeating several small Bulgarian forces. The centuries-old mistrust between Bulgarians and Byzantines spoiled the negotiations between the two empires for an alliance and even led to the last Byzantine-Bulgarian war in 1364. In 1371 a large Bulgarian-Serb army under Vukašin Mrnjavčević and Jovan Uglješa, two feudal lords in Macedonia, was annihilated by the Ottomans under Lala Shahin Pasha at Chernomen and soon the Bulgarian Emperor <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the defeat and became a vassal to the invaders. Numerous Bulgarian fortresses in the Rhodope mountains, Sofia valley and eastern Bulgaria were captured one by one over the next twenty years. In 1393 the capital Tarnovo was besieged and seized by the Ottoman Turks and three years later fell Vidin - the last major Bulgarian city. Resistance to the invaders continued until 1422 when the country was fully conquered. The Ottoman invasion was {{a disaster for the}} Bulgarian army— the nobility and the leaders of the nation were killed or emigrated and civilians were not allowed to have weapons until the 19th century.|$|E

[...] A few days later, on the 26March, Quiney appeared before the Bawdy Court, which dealt, among other things, with [...] "whoredom and uncleanliness." [...] Confessing in open court to [...] "carnal copulation" [...] with Margaret Wheeler, he submitted himself for correction {{and was sentenced to}} open penance [...] "in a white sheet (according to custom)" [...] before the [...] on three Sundays.

If the opponent had partaken in a similar action he was forced to drink a shot. Storm was the victor of this round. The second round was contested with both participants having beer bottles taped to their hands and neither being allowed to go to the bathroom. Young won after Storm wet himself, which was confirmed by Ms. Jackie, now named Jackie Moore. The third round involved the two drinking shots; it was won by Storm after Young passed out because Storm had drugged him. With Storm winning two contests to one, he earned the ability to determine their match at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008. At Against All Odds, Young defeated Storm to retain the TNA World Beer Drinking Championship after Rhino interfered attacking Storm. On the February 28, 2008 episode of Impact!, a Ladder match for the World Beer Drinking Championship was held between Storm and Young. Storm won the bout after Moore climbed a ladder and retrieved the championship for Storm without the referee seeing. On the March 6, 2008 episode of Impact!, Rhino stole the title belt from Storm and bashed the belt across a ring post, thus destroying it and ending the storyline surrounding it.|$|E
