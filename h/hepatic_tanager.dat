50|$|The <b>hepatic</b> <b>tanager</b> (Piranga flava) is a {{medium-sized}} American songbird. Formerly {{placed in the}} tanager family (Thraupidae), it {{and other members of}} its genus are now classified in the cardinal family (Cardinalidae). The species's plumage and vocalizations are similar to other members of the cardinal family.|$|E

Between autumn and spring, the <b>hepatic</b> <b>tanager</b> and chipping sparrow are also evident.

Winter {{visitors}} include the <b>hepatic</b> <b>tanager</b> and chipping sparrow. Orange-breasted falcons {{are more common}} in the area than elsewhere in Belize. Other fauna present in the reserve are the frog species Rana juliani (which is restricted to the Maya Mountains) and Eleutherodactylus sandersoni, and the fish species Poecilia teresae. The pine forest has been seriously damaged by the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis, with 80% of the trees showing signs of attack.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Hepatic</b> <b>Tanager</b> Piranga flava (Vieillot, 1822) is {{considered}} rare in southern Brazil and its occurrence in southeastern Rio Grande do Sul is controversial. Here, our aims were {{to investigate and}} compile the historical and recent evidences of the species in this region by consulting museums, literature and providing documented recent records. We confirmed the origins of two old specimens and provided nineteen recent records obtained in five sites between 2008 and 2010. Our results show that Piranga flava occurs in southeastern of Rio Grande do Sul since the late 1800 s and currently may be found all year long in this region...|$|E
