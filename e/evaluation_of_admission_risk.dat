40|$|Summary: Pain control {{measures}} in sickle cell diseases are not uniform. Most clinicians use parenteral morphine or meperidine for severe pain. Reports of seizures associated with meperidine {{have led to}} a growing reliance on intravenous morphine, usually with patient-controlled devices. Acceptance of morphine has been poor among patients, and many prefer meperidine. The aim of this retrospective {{study was to determine the}} incidence of meperidine-associated seizures in a large, mostly pediatric population with sickling disorders. The results suggest that the incidence of seizures with meperidine is extremely small (0. 4 % of patients; 0. 06 % <b>of</b> <b>admissions).</b> The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> seizures should not dissuade clinicians from using this drug.

40|$|Background This thesis {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} if adverse health outcomes in older community-dwelling {{people can be}} predicted, {{through the application of}} measures of prescribing, multimorbidity and emergency <b>admission</b> <b>risk</b> models. There were five objectives: 1) to determine if there is a longitudinal association between potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) and future adverse drug events (ADEs), reduced health related quality of life (HRQOL) and increased use of Accident 2 ̆ 6 Emergency (A 2 ̆ 6 E) and emergency admissions; 2) to assess the performance of different measures of multimorbidity and vulnerability in predicting emergency hospital attendance and functional decline; 3) to conduct a systematic review <b>of</b> emergency <b>admission</b> <b>risk</b> prediction models developed for use in community-dwelling adults; 4) to systematically review and meta-analyse the validation studies of the Probability <b>of</b> repeated <b>admissions</b> (Pra) <b>risk</b> model; and, 5) to externally validate the Pra risk model in predicting emergency hospital admission over the following year. Methods A prospective cohort study with two year follow-up was conducted linked to the national Health Services Executive Primary Care Reimbursement Services (HSE-PCRS) pharmacy claims database (2010 - 2012). At baseline a total of 904 older (≥ 70 years) community-dwelling people were recruited from 15 general practices. The Screening Tool of Older Persons Prescriptions (STOPP) and Beers 2012 prescribing indicator sets were applied to the pharmacy data to elicit PIP.

40|$|AbstractThe {{prevalence}} of patients colonized with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) -producing bacteria increases, especially in long-term-care facilities (LTCFs). Identification of ESBL carriers at hospital admission is relevant for infection control measures and antibiotic therapy for nosocomial infections. We {{aimed to develop}} a prediction rule for ESBL carriage at hospital admission for patients admitted from home and LTCFs, and to quantify incidences of nosocomial infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria. The ESBL-carrier status was determined of patients admitted from LTCFs and from home settings in four hospitals in the Netherlands using perianal swabs obtained within 48 hours <b>of</b> <b>admission.</b> <b>Risk</b> factors for ESBL carriage were assessed. Infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria were identified retrospectively. Among 1351 patients, 111 (8. 2 %) were ESBL carriers at admission: 50 / 579 (8. 6 %) admitted from LTCFs and 61 / 772 (7. 9 %) from home settings (p 0. 63). Previous ESBL carriage and previous hospital <b>admission</b> were <b>risk</b> factors for ESBL carriage in multivariable analysis. The area under {{the curve of the}} receiver operating characteristic curve of the model was 0. 64 (95 % CI 0. 58 – 0. 71). Presence of ≥ 1 risk factor (n =  803; 59 %) had sensitivity of 72 %. Incidences of nosocomial infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria were 45. 5 / 10 000 and 2. 1 / 10 000 admission days for ESBL carriers and non-carriers, respectively (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, {{prevalence of}} ESBL carriage at hospital admission was 8. 2 %, and was comparable among patients admitted from LTCF and home. A clinically useful prediction rule for ESBL carriage at admission could not be developed. The absolute incidence of nosocomial infections by ESBL-producing bacteria was low, but higher among patients carrying ESBL-producing bacteria at the time <b>of</b> hospital <b>admission...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{factors associated}} with unscheduled admission following presentation to emergency departments (EDs) at three hospitals in England. Design and setting Cross-sectional analysis of attendance data for patients from three urban EDs in England: a large teaching hospital and major trauma centre (site 1) and two district general hospitals (sites 2 and 3). Variables included patient age, gender, ethnicity, deprivation score, arrival date and time, arrival by ambulance or otherwise, a variety of ED workload measures, inpatient bed occupancy rates and admission outcome. Coding inconsistencies in routine ED data {{used for this study}} meant that diagnosis could not be included. Outcome measure The primary outcome for the study was unscheduled admission. Participants All adults aged 16 and older attending the three inner London EDs in December 2013. Data on 19 734 unique patient attendances were gathered. Results Outcome data were available for 19 721 attendances (> 99 %), of whom 6263 (32 %) were admitted to hospital. Site 1 was set as the baseline site for analysis <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> <b>risk.</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> was significantly greater at sites 2 and 3 (adjusted OR (AOR) relative to site 1 for site 2 was 1. 89, 95 % CI 1. 74 to 2. 05, p< 0. 001) and for patients of black or black British ethnicity (AOR 1. 29, 1. 16 to 1. 44, p< 0. 001). Deprivation was strongly associated with <b>admission.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> departmental and hospital-wide workload pressures gave conflicting results, but proximity to the “ 4 -hour target” (a rule that limits patient stays in EDs to 4 hours in the National Health Service in England) emerged as a strong driver for admission in this analysis (AOR 3. 61, 95 % CI 3. 30 to 3. 95, p< 0. 001).

40|$|Objective: Venous tromboembolism is an {{important}} factor of morbidity and mortality for hospitalized patients. Recently, despite the progression on diagnosis and treatment, diciplinary approaches to prophylaxis, consisting of a consensus cannot be applied. In this study, our aim was to determine the level of risk for DVT and PE who were operated in our clinic and to indicate the prevention by appropriate prophylaxis. Material and Methods: 432 patients, who were admitted to our clinic and underwent oncologic or laparoscopic operations between Jan. 2007 and Jan. 2010 were included in this study. The age, sex, duration <b>of</b> <b>admission,</b> <b>risk</b> levels for VTE, risk factors and results of prophylaxis were determined. Results: 214 patients were female and 218 were male. Mean age was 48 (24 - 80). The mean lenght of stay was 6 (2 - 25) days. Very-high-risk group included 19 patients (4, 4 %), whereas high-risk group included 49 (11, 3 %), medium-risk group included 71 (16, 4 %) and low-risk group included 293 (67, 9 %) patients. Prophylaxis included early mobilization for low-risk group, 2 doses of LMWH in 24 hours for medium-risk group, LMWH for 7 - 10 days for high-risk group and LMWH, antiembolic socks, early mobilization and IPC (intermittant pneumotic compression) for very-high risk group. 2 patients had DVT and 1 had PE under appropriate prophylaxis.

40|$|A {{few studies}} have {{assessed}} {{the effects of the}} current levels of air quality in relation to stationary and indoor emission sources, monitoring sites and susceptible populations. To address this issue, first, an ecological <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> the elderly aged ≥ 65 years and the PM 10 for the period 1995 - 2000 was carried out to assess vulnerability of this population. Secondly, a longitudinal study was conducted during the period of May 2003 to May 2004 among adults aged 50 to 79 years who had a cardiopulmonary diagnosis and resided in Allegheny County. Each participant maintained a diary of symptoms, peak expiratory flow rates and daily activities for up to two months. The ecological data showed high rates <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> among the elderly. Individuals admitted multiple times often had a diagnosis related to acute conditions compared to the chronic diagnoses among those admitted only one-time. The <b>admission</b> category <b>of</b> whether an individual was admitted multiple times or one-time appeared to be significantly related to the PM 10. The longitudinal study included a total of 32 participants, mean age 66. The average 24 -hr PM 10 level was 24. 36 µg/m 3. The results showed an association between PM 10 and the cardiopulmonary symptoms suggesting a possible effect of air pollution. Additionally, the results of the continuous monitoring sites were highly correlated during both study periods. This finding proposes a review of the current federal and county air pollution monitoring strategies. Efforts should be re-directed at appropriate apportionment of individuals' exposure levels and examining possible sources of emissions that impact the living environments. This can be achieved through personal monitoring in conjunction with physiological assessments for improved exposure-outcome extrapolation. The public health significance {{of this study is that}} the less severe incidences reported by participants do not often require urgent medical support, but can eventually burden the body's physiological mechanism leading to hospitalization or death. The implication of the results is that the current ambient air quality standards do not appear to be entirely protective of all different population groups.

METHODS: We investigated hospital admissions during the first 3 years of life for all singleton children born in Western Australia between 1994 and 2000 [1328 ART, 162 350 spontaneously conceived (SC) ]. RESULTS: ART infants had a significantly longer birth admission and were {{four times more likely}} to be admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) than SC infants. ART children had a 60 % greater risk of one or more admissions in their first year and an equal <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> in their second and third years.

MethodThis is a retrospective <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> all <b>admissions</b> with severe sepsis and septic shock to a general intensive care unit {{over a period of}} six months. ResultsA total number of 96 patients were included, which represented 15 % of the total number <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> during the study period. The mean age was 57. 4 (SD 21). Sixty percent of cases were due to hospital-acquired infections, and 40 % were community-acquired. The majority of the infections acquired in the hospital occurred in medical wards and intensive care units (27 % and 21 %, respectively). At least one co-morbid condition was present in 94 % of the sample patients, with cardiovascular disease and diabetes being the most frequently encountered disorders (58 %). Both community and hospital-acquired severe sepsis and septic shock carry very high mortality (58 %). The ICU length of stay was significantly longer for hospital and ICU acquired infections.

On a national level, three factors have signalled a timeous <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> practices at HE institutions. Firstly, changes in the school curriculum and the new format of the National Senior Certificate (NSC) have impacted on the <b>admissions</b> criteria <b>of</b> HE institutions. Secondly, with the merging of HE institutions an alignment in admissions practices between the institutions involved were necessitated. Thirdly, South Africa has embarked on the development of National Benchmark Tests (NBTs). The primary aim of this research study was to develop a set of recommendations to guide admissions testing practices in the South African HE context. These recommendations had to place special emphasis on the multicultural and multilingual context of this country. To achieve this aim a systematic review was conducted on HE admissions testing in Israel, as it was identified as a multicultural and multilingual country that had successfully implemented national HE admissions testing. More specifically, a retrospective systematic review was performed on research regarding the national HE admissions test, the Psychometric Entrance Test (PET), used in Israel. The systematic review also contained a narrative overview on the educational landscape in Israel and the specifications of the PET, from which themes were also extracted. Eight broad themes emerged through the systematic review and narrative overview as being of critical importance to an effective national HE admissions test. These were the components of the test, the implementation of the testing programme, the method in which the test results are used to make HE admission decisions, the reliability xi of the test, the validity of the test, bias inherent in the test, other psychometric aspects related to the admissions test, and the effect of coaching or specialized preparation on test results. These themes, together with their sub-components, were used to develop eight recommendations that can guide {{the development and implementation of}} the National Benchmark Test (NBTs) in South Africa.

40|$|The use of {{adaptive}} techniques in mobile networks permits scalable resource allocation policies to meet varying demand {{as well as}} Quality of Service (QoS) performance objectives. As these algorithms operate at multiple layers of the communications architecture, <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> such techniques {{must take into account}} a variety of scenarios, which are in turn parameterized by a large number of variables. The need to monitor algorithm behavior in real time results in a data explosion. In this work, we propose new real-time metrics to characterize and identify the critical states of a mobile network in the wake of channel failures, congestion, signal degradation, etc. We use these metrics to define a survivability index, a measure of mobile network performance in the wake of failures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of information visu-alization techniques in understanding the complex spatial and temporal relationships between perfor-mance and cost metrics that influence adaptive algo-rithms. Our visualization system is highly scalable and interactive, permitting multiple algorithms to be simultaneously evaluated. We demonstrate applica-tions to network monitoring and to the design and <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> adaptive <b>admission</b> control algorithms...|$|R

Introduction: The {{relationship}} between pancreatitis and dyslipidaemia is unclear {{and has never}} been studied in a South African context. Patients and methods: A prospective <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> all <b>admissions</b> with acute pancreatitis to a regional hospital general surgical service was performed to ascertain its relationship to dyslipidaemia. Aetiology was determined by history and ultrasound assessment. Disease severity was assessed using a modified Imrie score and an organ failure score. Body mass index was calculated. A lipid profile was obtained. Abnormal profiles were repeated. Secondary causes of dyslipidaemia were noted. A comparison of the demographic profile, aetiology, disease severity scores, complications and deaths were made in relationship to the lipid profiles. Results: From June 2001 to May 2005, there were 230 <b>admissions,</b> <b>of</b> whom 31 % were women and 69 % men. The median age was 38 years(range 13 - 73). The pancreatitis was associated with alcohol in 146 (63 %), gallstones in 42 (19 %) and idiopathic in 27 (12 %). The amylase was significantly higher with a gallstone aetiology (...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{complementary}} {{characteristics of}} cellular systems and wireless local area networks (WLANs) make them attractive candidates to jointly offer a seamless wireless solution. In an integrated cellular/WLAN system, {{the quality of}} service (QoS) requirements for different services (e. g., voice and realtime video) require adequate admission control policies {{to limit the number}} of connections in each network. In this paper, we analytically develop a comprehensive model to facilitate the optimal <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> different <b>admission</b> control policies in a multi-service integrated cellular/WLAN system. Given the model, we formulate two optimization problems to adjust admission control parameters. The first problem is to maximize the network revenue while the second problem is to minimize the required network resources subject to QoS constraints. We evaluate each problem when different combinations of cutoff priority and fractional guard channel admission control policies are being used. We show that a combination of two cutoff priority policies achieves the best solution for both problems. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a simulation {{analysis for the}} <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>admission</b> region <b>of</b> a IEEE 802. 11 e network adopting the EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access) mechanism. In particular, this study gives {{an estimate of the}} number of QoS-aware applications, namely videoconference and Voice over IP (VoIP), that can be admitted to the transport service offered by the EDCA while satisfying their QoS require-ments. The traffic sources adopted for the simulation are obtained from measurement campaigns led on the emulation of VoIP and videoconfer-ence services based respectively on the G. 723. 1 and the H. 263 codecs. The results emphasize the bottleneck role played by the Access Point when services producing symmetrical traffic are conveyed over an 802. 11 e ac-cess network. Furthermore, the QoS parameters experienced in a mix of VoIP, videoconference and TCP traffic under EDCA are compared with those obtained when the DCF mechanism is adopted. This comparison clearly highlights the efficiency in traffic differentiation of the EDCA algorithm. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{complementary}} {{characteristics of}} wireless cellular networks and wireless local area networks (WLANs) make them suitable to jointly offer seamless wireless access services to mobile users. In an integrated cellular/WLAN system, {{the quality of}} service (QoS) requirements for different services (e. g., voice, real-time video) require admission control {{to limit the number}} of connections in each access network. In this paper, we first develop an analytical model to facilitate the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> different <b>admission</b> control policies in a multi-service integrated cellular/WLAN system. We then formulate two different revenue maximization problems. Each problem takes different QoS requirements into account. By solving the equivalent cost minimization problems, we evaluate the system performance when different combinations of cutoff priority and fractional guard channel admission control policies are being used. Results show that using cutoff priority policy in both wireless access networks can achieve the optimal solution for the two optimization problems under a wide range of network conditions...|$|R
40|$|Objective: It {{has been}} {{reported}} that polypharmacy was frequent and increased lately. In our study, our purpose was to define the prevalence of polypharmacy and the level of polypharmacy according to the specified diagnostic groups. Method: The files of 201 inpatients admitted between January 2010 and January 2011 were evaluated retrospectively. For every patient’s last admission, prescribed drugs at that <b>admission,</b> time period <b>of</b> that <b>admission,</b> the number <b>of</b> past <b>admissions</b> and demographic data were evaluated and statistical analysis was performed. Results: In the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the last <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> 201 inpatients, it was detected that 145 (72. 1 %) patients had been given polypharmacy at discharge. Polypharmacy was mostly used in psychotic patients (60 %) and number of drugs used per patient was 2. 2. Polypharmacy was significantly more frequent in patients living in cities, with a longer hospital stay and in patients with higher number <b>of</b> past <b>admissions.</b> Conclusion: Our finding of high percentage of polypharmacy shows that treatment algorithms are not followed as much as expected. With the development of the evidence based psychiatry, it is necessary to define ratios of benefits and harms while using polypharmacy. Only by this way, questions about if polypharmacy is a suitable approach or if the treatment algorithms can be changed accordingly may be answered...|$|R
