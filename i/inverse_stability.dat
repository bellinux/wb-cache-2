40|$|In modern power systems, the {{operating}} point, {{at which the}} demand and supply are balanced, may take different values due to changes in loads and renewable generation levels. Understanding the dynamics of stressed power systems {{with a range of}} operating points would be essential to assuring their reliable operation, and possibly allow higher integration of renewable resources. This letter introduces a non-traditional way to think about the stability assessment problem of power systems. Instead of estimating the set of initial states leading to a given operating condition, we characterize the set of operating conditions that a power grid converges to from a given initial state under changes in power injections and lines. We term this problem as "inverse stability", a problem which is rarely addressed in the control and systems literature, and hence, poorly understood. Exploiting quadratic approximations of the system's energy function, we introduce an estimate of the <b>inverse</b> <b>stability</b> region. Also, we briefly describe three important applications of the <b>inverse</b> <b>stability</b> notion: (i) robust stability assessment of power systems w. r. t. different renewable generation levels, (ii) stability-constrained optimal power flow (sOPF), and (iii) stability-guaranteed corrective action design...|$|E

This study investigates the influence of social inhibition on the <b>inverse</b> emotional <b>stability</b> (neuroticism) and depressive symptoms found in elderly Thai people. Methods In total, 123 elderly Thais aged 60 [*]years of age or older were tested using the 64 -item Inventory of Interpersonal Problems, Symptom Checklist- 90, and the 16 Personality Factors Questionnaire. Hierarchical regression and path analyses were performed in order to identify the relationships among these variables. Results The age of the participants ranged from 60 to 93 [*]years old (mean[*]=[*] 71. 7; SD[*]=[*] 6. 2), and out of the group, 51. 2 % were male, 56. 1 % were married and 61. 8 % were on a low income. The average number of years spent in education among the participants was 7. 6 (SD[*]=[*] 5. 1). The variables found to be significantly associated with depression were age, intellect, social inhibition and possession of <b>inverse</b> emotional <b>stability</b> (neuroticism). Low levels of emotional stability were most strongly associated with depressive symptoms (standardized regression coefficients − 0. 29), but this effect was found to be reduced (mediated, to − 0. 26) by social inhibition. In total, 30 % of the total variance could be explained by this model, and there was an excellent statistical fit. Conclusions The variables found to be significantly associated with depression were a younger age, as well as lower levels of intellectual skill, social inhibition and <b>inversed</b> emotional <b>stability</b> (neuroticism). It was found that a lack of emotional stability is, along with a younger age, the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms, but can be mediated by social inhibition. </p...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{admitted that the}} classical conditioning technique is restricted to some application conditions like the bi-property of the controller and its <b>inverse</b> <b>stability.</b> Some extensions to overcome these restrictions are recalled in the paper. The conditioning technique has been conceived and must always be considered as an a posteriori anti-windup method (the a priori knowledge of the non-linearity acting on the desired control variable has not to be known, provided a post-measurement of the actual control variable is available). Hence, this kind of "feedback" anti-windup should always be used because it is never possible to prejudge of any non-linearity that could appear. However, when an a priori knowledge of some non-linearities is available, {{it is possible to}} include this knowledge either in the synthesis of the controller or in the design of a "feedforward" anti-windup. Two methods of feedforward anti-windup are given in the paper, namely the optimal conditioning and the predictive conditioning techniques. We propose to keep the term conditioning for these last anti-windup schemes, because as in the classical conditioning technique, we try to "condition" the controller to be able to carry on, as soon as possible, {{in the same way as}} in the linear case. © 2000 EUCA.

40|$|The {{thermally}} driven wind over mountainous terrains challenges {{the estimation of}} CO 2 exchange between forests and the atmosphere when using the eddy covariance technique. In this study, the wind regimes were investigated in a temperate deciduous forested valley at the Maoershan site, Northeast China. The wind direction above the canopy was preferentially up-valley in the daytime and down-valley in the nighttime, corresponding to the diurnal patterns of above-canopy temperature gradient and stability parameter. In both leaf-on and -off nighttime, a down-valley flow with a maximum velocity of 1 ~ 3 m∙s− 1 was often developed at 42 m above the ground (2. 3 -fold of the canopy height). However, the below-canopy prevailing wind was down-slope in the night, contrast to the below-canopy temperature lapse and unstable conditions. This substantial directional shear illustrated shallow slope winds were superimposed on larger-scale valley winds. As a consequence, the valley-wind component becomes stronger with increasing height, indicating a clear confluence of drainage flow to the valley center. In the daytime, the below-canopy wind was predominated down-slope due to the temperature inversion and stable conditions in the leaf-on season, and was mainly up-valley or down-slope in the leaf-off season. The isolation of momentum flux and radiation by the dense canopy {{played a key role}} in the formation of the below-canopy unaligned wind and <b>inverse</b> <b>stability.</b> Significant lateral kinematic momentum fluxes were detected due to the directional shear.

Over and above its simplicity and efficiency, the algorithm could test for the existence of the inverse such that prior check was not necessary. Massey and Sain [18] in the same period discussed the existence, properties and the development scheme of inverses of linear systems.

Intensification of agroforests did not significantly affect species richness of hosts or enemies or their relation to parasitism and its temporal variability.
