500|$|Dinklage has {{received}} widespread praise for his performance, with Matthew Gilbert from The Boston Globe saying that Dinklage [...] "gives a winning performance that is charming, morally ambiguous, and self-aware". Dan Kois of The New York Times noted that Dinklage's performance {{has made the}} character [...] "all the more popular". The Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "In many ways, Game of Thrones belongs to Dinklage". Tyrion {{has been called the}} [...] "most quotable" [...] character and [...] "one of the most beloved characters" [...] of the series. For his performance, he has gone on to win a Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2011 and 2015, as well as the 2012 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. As a result of his performance and increased screen time, Dinklage was given top billing starting in the series' second season. In 2014, he said on The Late Show with David Letterman that he had once tried to read the books the show is based upon, but had found them confusing. He joked, [...] "George Martin, our author, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill my character soon because I mentioned that." [...] In 2014, Dinklage and four of his Game of Thrones co-stars became some of the highest paid actors on television, although sources differ on the actors' per-episode salaries as of 2017. In 2015, Dinklage lent his voice for the role of Tyrion in , an episodic graphic adventure video game based on the show.|$|E

FiveThirtyEight {{projected}} a {{much higher}} probability of Donald Trump winning the presidency than other pollsters, a projection which was criticized by Ryan Grim of the Huffington Post as [...] "unskewing" [...] too {{much in favor of}} Trump. And while FiveThirtyEight expressed that [...] "nonetheless, Clinton <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win, and she could win by a big margin", the forecaster also made a point about the unreliability of poll trackers in some cases, about a considerable number of undecided voters and about the unpredictable outcome in traditional swing states.|$|E

2500|$|The {{psychedelic}} frogfish {{is relatively}} defenseless, but by hiding in these tight passages {{it is highly}} unlikely that any fish capable of swallowing it will be able to reach it. [...] The combination of camouflage and the tight cavities in which it might hide makes it virtually impossible to find a psychedelic frogfish without overturning rocks and coral. [...] According to Andy Shorten, co-owner of the Maluku Divers diving facility where the fish was discovered, [...] "Seeking out these fish <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be like the Holy Grail of divers for a while." ...|$|E
2500|$|The use {{of amber}} lights to alert drivers that a spotter vehicle is parked is controversial. Light bars and strobe lights have been {{becoming}} increasingly popular with storm spotters and storm chasers since, proponents claim, both groups often travel {{in less than}} ideal weather conditions where visibility may be limited. However, in recent years, some spotters and chasers have been seen using red, blue, white, and/or green lighting devices, apparently imitating emergency vehicles. Such actions are illegal in most areas and are highly condemned by both the spotter and storm chaser communities. Said Chuck Doswell, [...] "flashing light bars added to your chase vehicle (similar to those used by law enforcement) may be illegal in some places and their use to imply some sort of official status to your chasing <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get you in trouble". Chris Novy, a trainer of storm spotters throughout the US and a veteran storm chaser, also notes that lights distract and can even unconsciously attract other drivers and that lights may encourage people to drive aggressively or to park in situations they would otherwise avoid and thus increase danger to themselves and to other drivers.|$|E

I feel sorry sometimes after I have sent them, I have said so much about hospitals, and so mournful. O mother, {{the young man in}} Armory-square, Dennis Barrett, in the 169th N. Y., I mentioned before, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get up after all; he is like one saved from the grave. Saturday last I saw him and talked with him and gave him something to eat, and he was much better--it is the most unexpected recovery I have yet seen. Mother, I see Jeff says in the letter you don't hear from me very often--I will write oftener, especially to Jeff. Dear brother, I hope you are getting along good, and in good spirits; you must not mind the failure of the sewer bills, etc. It don't seem to me it makes so much difference about worldly successes (beyond just enough to eat and drink and shelter, in the moderatest limits) any more, since the last four months of my life especially, and that merely to live, and have one fair meal a day, is enough--but then you have a family, and that makes a difference.|$|E

50|$|The {{future of}} Saudi Arabian oil is {{complicated}} by the fact that the major Saudi oil fields are extremely old and have been producing oil for decades.

Such increased difficulty and expense may indicate that Saudi Arabian oil fields have already peaked.|$|E

Despite Jamie's (Eric Ladin) insistence, Richmond refuses to negotiate with Jackson, saying that she only serves herself.
