These theories axiomatize standard data-types such bit-vectors and {{have proved to}} be quite useful for, e. g., hardware verification. Elimination of trivial sequents often reduces to the problem of proving the unsatisfiability of conjunctions of literals modulo a background theory, which is the problem we shall consider here. We show how a superposition-based inference system for first-order equational logic can be used almost directly as a satisfiability procedure for various theories including lists, arrays, extensional arrays and combinations of them.

40|$|Colloque sans acte à <b>diffusion</b> <b>restreinte.</b> internationale. International audienceDefining the {{behaviour}} {{of a set}} of situated agents, {{such that}} a collaborative problem can be solved is a key issue in multi-agent systems. In this paper, we formulate this problem from the decision theoretic perspective using the framework of Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (DEC-POMDP). Formulating the coordination problem in this way provides a formal foundation for study of cooperation activities. But, as it has been recently shown solving DEC-POMDP is NEXP-complete and thus it is not a realistic approach for the design of agent cooperation policies. However, we demonstrate in this paper that it is not completely desperate. Indeed, we propose an heuristic approach for solving DEC-POMDP when agents are memoryless and when the global reward function can be broken up into a sum of local reward functions. We demonstrate experimentally on an example (the so-called pursuit problem) that this heuristic is efficient within a few iteration steps...|$|E

The protocol relies on a contract between the operator who ensures a minimum rate and the source who must respect a rate that is dynamically allocated to him, according to the resources available in the networks. An ABR conformance algorithm for controlling the source rates through an interface has been defined by ATM Forum. A more efficient version of this algorithm has been designed rk 97. We present in this work the first complete mechanical verification of the equivalence between these two algorithms. The proof is rather involved and has been supported by the PVS theorem-prover. It has required many lemmas, case analysis and induction reasoning for the manipulation of non bounded scheduling lists. Some ABR conformance protocols have been automatically verified in previous works. However these protocols are approximations of the one we consider here...|$|E
40|$|Colloque sans acte à <b>diffusion</b> <b>restreinte.</b> The {{study of}} congruences in topological spaces {{is a very}} old and {{difficult}} problem (McKinsey, Tarski 1942). It has been re-discovered recently in connection to a rough equality of sets (Pawlak 1989). The rough equality is a congruence with respect to rough operations of lower and upper approximation and a set complement, but fails to be the congruence with respect to set union and intersection. We define here new operators corresponding to the union and intersection of sets so that rough equality becomes a congruence with respect to them. In order to motivate their definition we introduce a new technique called Rough Diagrams. Rough Diagrams correspond to classical notion of Ven Diagrams and can {{also serve as a}} new and very intuitive way of contructing counter models for formulas that are not tautologies of modal logic S 5. Finally, we use an automated theorem proving system daTac, to prove that the quotient algebra with respect to the rough congruence is a topological quasi-Boolean algebra...|$|E
40|$|<b>Diffusion</b> <b>restreinte</b> 1 The {{paradigm}} of query directed learning, introduced by Angluin [Ang 87], {{has received a}} great deal of attention in the literature [Ang 90, AFP 92, AP 95, AKST 97, GST 02, GKS 03, KA 06]. In the standard concept learning framework, the learner is given a set of examples, the so-called training set, which is used to extrapolate an hypothesis that accurately approximates the target concept. By contrast, in the query directed learning model, the learner has access to an oracle that will answer specific kinds of queries about the target concept. From a cognitive viewpoint, the oracle can be thought as an ideal expert who is capable of helping the learner on identifying the target concept. The purpose of the present note is to provide a general overview of the query-directed learning model. We begin to examine the formal ingredients of the model. Next, we illustrate an application of this model in the setting of monotone DNF formulas. Finally, we conclude this note by discussing about several extensions of the model. 1 The Model The query directed learning model can be viewed as a repeated game between the learne...|$|E
40|$|Colloque sans acte à <b>diffusion</b> <b>restreinte.</b> internationale. International audienceIn {{the last}} decades the {{automation}} of reasoning by mathematical induction has been thoroughly investigated and several powerful techniques and heuristics have been put forward. However, when applied to proof obligations arising in practical applications, the level of automation achieved by existing induction provers is still unsatisfactory. As shown by Boyer and Moore, {{a higher level of}} automation can be achieved by the incorporation of decision procedures into induction provers. Yet in Boyer and Moore's approach the role of the decision procedure is confined to the simplification engine and this limits the possible usage of the decision procedure by the prover. In this paper we present an extension to Boyer and Moore's integration schema that enables the decision procedure to use suitably selected instances of the induction hypotheses. The induction proof method we consider is based on and combines Cover Set Induction and Constraint Contextual Rewriting and has been implemented in the SPIKE prover. Computer experiments on non-trivial verification problems give evidence of the effectiveness of our approach: the proof of the MJRTY algorithm does not need anymore user-defined tactics as it is the case with STeP and Nuprl. Moreover, we show that a reasoning specialist for non-linear arithmetic theory can be easily integrated. ...|$|E

International audienceIntonation, {{including}} {{details of}} tonal alignment [i. e., the synchronization of tones and segments (d'Imperio, 2000) ], has been {{claimed to be}} part of the phonological knowledge of native speakers. This linguistic knowledge can be assumed to influence the perception of tonal contrasts. Both American English and Neapolitan Italian have two rising pitch accents (L+H* and L*+H) whose alignment is contrastive, although details of their implementation differ. The accents also cue different pragmatic functions (e. g., cuing the question/statement contrast only in Neapolitan) and are subject to different syntagmatic constraints in the two languages. This study tested the hypotheses that the American listeners would be able to perceive the contrast between the two Neapolitan accents, despite the aforementioned differences, and that they would respond similarly to a linguistic (question/statement) and a psychoacoustic (early/late peak) identification task. The stimuli were constructed by manipulating the alignment of a Neapolitan utterance through PSOLA. These stimuli were employed in a linguistic task for both language groups and a psychoacoustic task for the Americans only. Although the Americans could perform the linguistic task, scoring similarly to the Neapolitans, they could not perform the categorization in the psychoacoustic task. The results bear upon the ``universality'' of tonal perception...|$|E

International audienceAlternative {{splicing}} is {{a biological}} process occurring in post-transcriptional regulation of RNA. Through {{the elimination of}} selected introns, alternative splicing allows the generation of several kinds of mature RNA from the same premessenger RNA. The resulting combinatorial complexity contributes to biological diversity, {{especially in the case}} of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV- 1). Recent biological studies show the impact that SR proteins have on the dynamics of post-transcriptional regulation via the control of the splicing process. Constraint programming seems well-suited for modeling alternative splicing regulation because it allows one to handle partial or incomplete information. Each constraint gives one piece of information on the system that is studied. The overall knowledge is accumulated in the constraint store. Using a hybrid constraint programming (hybrid cc) approach, we develop a model of the alternative splicing regulation in HIV- 1. Our model integrates different scales (single splicing site vs. multiple splicing sites), and thus allows us to exploit several types of experimental data available to us. The ultimate goal is to obtain a model that can be validated qualitatively both on the scale of a single splicing site and on the scale of the whole HIV- 1, in order to represent the global effect of alternative splicing in the HIV- 1 cycle...|$|E

International audienceTransition {{systems has}} been intensively {{applied to the}} {{modeling}} of complex systems, for example they {{have been used for}} giving semantics to synchronous languages such as Lustre or Signal, or to hybrid automata. Properties of their behavior can be verified using model checking procedures, which rely on an iterative computation of least or greatest fixed points. For instance, safety properties can be proved by a fixed point computation of the set of all the states that can access to the forbidden states and verifying that it does not contain an initial state. This approach has to face two main difficulties : the complexity of the data types domain and the termination of the iterative algorithm. They are solved by approximation heuristics such as abstract interpretations and widening operators. However, in many cases, a sharper analysis of the transition system can be exploited to speed up the calculus. Consequently, we propose an other algorithm to compute this fixed point taking advantage of the decomposition of the relation in an union of simpler relations. If the transition system is deterministic, then our algorithm computes the exact fixed point, otherwise it computes an over approximation. We have implemented this algorithm on top of a linear constraint solver over real number and applied it to the proof of a safety property of a reactive system and we compare with the model checker Hytech...|$|E
