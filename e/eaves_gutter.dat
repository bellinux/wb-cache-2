5000|$|Water from a {{pitched roof}} flows {{down into a}} valley gutter, a parapet gutter or an <b>eaves</b> <b>gutter.</b> An <b>eaves</b> <b>gutter</b> {{is also known as}} an eavestrough (especially in Canada), eaves channel, dripster, {{guttering}} or simply as a gutter. The word gutter derives from Latin gutta(noun), meaning [...] "a drop, spot or mark".|$|E
50|$|On the {{northern}} elevation the hipped roof {{extends beyond the}} wall to an ogee profile metal <b>eaves</b> <b>gutter.</b> The roof shades a secondary entrance which leads via concrete formed steps onto a small porch. Details {{are similar to the}} main elevation with arched openings and diamond-shaped infills repeated. A s bathroom building has been constructed immediately in front of the remainder of the elevation. It is a simple, timber-framed structure clad in profiled fibre-cement sheeting and supported on concrete stumps.|$|E
50|$|The {{eastern and}} western {{elevations}} have similar details to the front elevation. Parapet walls with decorative brackets extend half-way {{along the length of}} the building. Verandah openings have been enclosed with aluminium windows which are covered with a metal awning. For the remainder of these elevations the hipped roof and recent metal square- profile eaves gutters are exposed. On the northern (rear) elevation exterior walls end at the soffit line where the hipped roof extends to the <b>eaves</b> <b>gutter.</b> Openings on this elevation appear to have been altered and recent steps and ramps added. A recent projection has been built in the north-west corner of the verandah.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eaves</b> <b>gutters</b> can be {{made from}} a variety of {{materials}} such as cast iron, lead, zinc, galvanised steel, painted steel, copper, painted aluminium, PVC (and other plastics) and occasionally from concrete, stone, and wood.|$|R
50|$|The {{observatory}} {{building is}} a single-storey timber-framed structure set on low timber stumps. It is rectangular in plan with verandahs {{to the north and}} east which have been enclosed with weatherboard cladding and casement windows. It has a hipped roof with louvred gablets to the north, east and west and a small gable over the entry. The roof is clad in corrugated fibre-cement sheeting and has no <b>eaves</b> <b>gutters.</b> Cladding to all elevations is weatherboard. A shed-like structure has been added to south-west corner of the building.|$|R
50|$|The {{ambulance}} station, a timber-framed and clad building, is sheltered by a {{gabled roof}} with a lean-to the south. A large street awning shelters the wide entry doors facing the street. A concrete driveway slightly {{wider than the}} front of the building extends to the road crossover. The ambulance station is planned around a large garage space facing Crown Road with smaller scale rooms to the south and rear. A lean-to roofed annex runs along the southern side of the building. The roofs are clad in recent corrugated metal sheeting. Eaves are unlined and <b>eaves</b> <b>gutters</b> are quad-profile.|$|R
5000|$|A roof must be {{designed}} with a suitable fall {{to allow the}} rainwater to discharge. The water drains into a gutter that is fed into a downpipe. A flat roof will have a watertight surface with a fall of 1 in 60, or 1 {{in the case of}} lead. They can drain internally or to an <b>eaves</b> <b>gutter,</b> which has a minimum 1 in 360 fall towards the downpipe. [...] The pitch of a pitched roof is determined by the construction material of the covering. For slate this will be at 25%, for machine made tiles it will be 35%. Water falls towards a parapet gutter, a valley gutter or an <b>eaves</b> <b>gutter.</b> [...] When two pitched roofs meet at an angle, they also form a pitched valley gutter: the join is sealed with valley flashing. Parapet gutters and valley gutters discharge into internal rainwater pipes or directly into external down pipes {{at the end of the}} run. The capacity of the gutter is a significant design consideration. The area of the roof is calculated (metres) and this is multiplied by rainfall (litres/sec/metres²) which is assumed to be 0.0208. This gives a required discharge outfall capacity. (litres/sec) [...] Rainfall intensity, the amount of water likely to generated in a two-minute rainstorm is more important that average rainfall, the British Standards Institute notes that an indicative storm in Essex, (annual rainfall 500mm per annum) delivers 0.022 l/s/m²- while one in Cumbria (annual rainfall 1800mm per annum) delivers 0.014 l/s/m².|$|E
5000|$|The former Burns Philp {{building}} is a large timber-framed structure elevated on masonry and timber stumps and clad in vertically fixed corrugated iron sheeting. Behind a distinctive curved triple-fronted parapet facing south-east to Landsborough Street, the {{building is}} divided into three bays of varying width, each with a gabled roof and valley gutters running the length of the building. Two roof ventilators are positioned along the ridge of the middle bay. A timber-framed corrugated iron clad awning with ogee <b>eaves</b> <b>gutter</b> supported on posts (one early timber post survives) extends over each footpath. Two entrances are located on Caroline Street accessed by stairs and a connecting ramp. The kerbing to both streets is made from local stone and cast iron gutter covers inscribed with the words [...] "Normanton Municipal Council" [...] span the channel between the asphalt concrete road surface and concrete path to the footpath.|$|E
50|$|A {{rain gutter}} (also known as eavestrough (especially in Canada), <b>eaves</b> channel <b>guttering</b> or {{simply as a}} gutter) is a narrow channel, or trough, forming the {{component}} of a roof system which collects and diverts rainwater from the roof.|$|R
50|$|Cast iron gutters were {{introduced}} in the late 18th century {{as an alternative to}} lead. Cast iron enabled <b>eaves</b> <b>gutters</b> to be mass-produced: they were rigid and non-porous while lead could only be used as a liner within timber gutters. Installation was a single process and didn't require heat. They could be attached directly to the fascia board. Cast iron gutters are still specified for restoration work in conservation areas, but are usually replaced with cast aluminium made to the same profile. Extruded aluminium gutters can be made to a variety of profiles from a roll of aluminium sheet on site in lengths of up to 30m. They feature internal brackets at 400mm spacing.|$|R
5000|$|Their {{most notable}} {{project is the}} Harvey Graham Beach House, built in 1953. It {{was seen as a}} vanguard of post-war {{residential}} architecture. The design itself was in typical Hayes & Scott style with a slab-on-ground construction, flat roof and floor-to-ceiling glazing. The project was influenced by architects such as Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Due to similar characteristics, it has also been said that the design of the Beach House was strongly influenced by the drawings of the Case Study House by Charles Eames. Along with the modernist design came the murals which portrayed the partnership’s developmental approach to colour. Their love of using black on everything [...] "against the sky" [...] (e.g. <b>eaves,</b> <b>gutters,</b> chimney caps, etc.) is also seen.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevation}} facing west to Mellor Street {{has similar}} detailing {{to the main}} elevation. It is symmetrical in layout with stucco quoins emphasizing the corners while horizontal banding visually distinguishes the building's two floor levels. A false balcony runs along the upper floor level with decorative wrought iron balustrading and art nouveau style lights at each end. A large arched window framed with ruled stucco reveals, lintel and keystone rises from the lower level and is finished with a shallow awning formed from masonry supported on oversized decorative brackets. On the upper floor three tall rectangular windows with timber-framed double-hung sashes are sheltered by a timber framed window awning supported on pairs of carved timber brackets. <b>Eaves</b> <b>gutters</b> to the main roof and the upper window awning are formed from metal and are quad-profiled.|$|R
50|$|This {{building}} is located {{to the west}} of the 1991 extension. It is of similar construction to the s buildings but has simpler detailing and little decoration. It has a hipped roof clad in corrugated metal sheeting and external walls of rendered reinforced concrete which extend to ground level. Rectangular ventilation slots mark the sub- floor area. <b>Eaves</b> <b>gutters</b> are recent and square in profile. External windows are aluminium framed glass louvres with recent security grilles fixed to the exterior to the western and eastern elevations with some sliding windows on the western and northern elevations. The entrance area is located on the western elevation and is accessed by a concrete-formed ramp. The entrance door has sidelights of timber lattice. Some early fixed timber louvres are located on the eastern elevation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{function}} of the projecting cornice of a building is to throw rainwater free of the building’s walls. In residential building practice, this function is handled by projecting gable ends, roof <b>eaves,</b> and <b>gutters.</b> However, house <b>eaves</b> may also be called [...] "cornices" [...] if they are finished with decorative molding. In this sense, while most cornices are also eaves (in that they overhang {{the sides of the}} building), not all eaves are usually considered cornices - eaves are primarily functional and not necessarily decorative, and a cornice has a decorative aspect to it.|$|R
50|$|Runoff into storm sewers can be {{minimized}} by including sustainable urban drainage systems (UK term) or low impact development or green infrastructure practices (US terms) into municipal plans. To reduce stormwater from rooftops, flows from <b>eaves</b> troughs (rain <b>gutters</b> and downspouts) may be infiltrated into adjacent soil, rather than discharged into the storm sewer system. Storm water runoff from paved surfaces can {{be directed to}} unlined ditches (sometimes called swales or bioswales) before flowing into the storm sewers, again to allow the runoff to soak into the ground. Permeable paving materials {{can be used in}} building sidewalks, driveways and in some cases, parking lots, to infiltrate a portion of the stormwater volume.|$|R
