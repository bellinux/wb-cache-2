25|$|The {{origin of}} the Martian moons is still controversial. Phobos and Deimos both {{have much in common}} with {{carbonaceous}} C-type asteroids, with spectra, albedo, and density very similar to those of C- or D-type asteroids. Based on their similarity, one hypothesis is that both moons may be captured main-belt asteroids. Both moons have very circular orbits which lie almost exactly in Mars's equatorial plane, and hence a capture origin requires a mechanism for circularizing the initially highly eccentric orbit, and adjusting its inclination into the equatorial plane, most probably by a combination of atmospheric drag and tidal forces, although {{it is not clear that}} sufficient time is available for this to occur for Deimos. Capture also requires <b>dissipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> The current Martian atmosphere is too thin to capture a Phobos-sized object by atmospheric braking. Geoffrey Landis has pointed out that the capture could have occurred if the original body was a binary asteroid that separated under tidal forces.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The viscous {{coefficient}} of a homogeneous ER fluid {{can be changed}} by the application of an electric field. However, the ER effect of the fluid is easily varied by temperature variation. Therefore, an envelopment and time in which the fluid is applied is limited. In this paper, we examine {{the influence of the}} thermal effects induced on the fluid by the device, in order to construct more reliable homogeneous ER devices. We discuss two kinds of thermal effects caused by joule heat and the <b>dissipation</b> <b>of</b> viscous <b>energy.</b> The results <b>of</b> simulations and experiments suggest that most of the exothermic elements of the homogeneous ER fluid are caused by the <b>dissipation</b> <b>of</b> viscosity <b>energy</b> in the fluid. Therefore, it seems reasonable to drive the clutch at a low rotating speed for short periods. We think that a robot arm for impedance control is more effective than a damper for vibration control.

2500|$|What is the {{explanation}} for this phenomenon? A large Reynolds number indicates that viscous forces are not important at large scales of the flow. With a strong predominance of inertial forces over viscous forces, the largest scales of fluid motion are undamped—there is not enough viscosity to dissipate their motions. The kinetic energy must [...] "cascade" [...] from these large scales to progressively smaller scales until a level is reached for which the scale is small enough for viscosity to become important (that is, viscous forces become {{of the order of}} inertial ones). It is at these small scales where the <b>dissipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> by viscous action finally takes place. The Reynolds number indicates at what scale this viscous dissipation occurs.|$|E
2500|$|The vortex {{model of}} 1944, {{formulated}} by German physicist and philosopher Baron Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, which harkens {{back to the}} Cartesian model, [...] involved a pattern of turbulence-induced eddies in a Laplacian nebular disc. In it a suitable combination of clockwise rotation of each vortex and anti-clockwise rotation of the whole system can lead to individual elements moving around the central mass in Keplerian orbits {{so there would be}} little <b>dissipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> due to the overall motion of the system but material would be colliding at high relative velocity in the inter-vortex boundaries and in these regions small roller-bearing eddies would coalesce to give annular condensations. It was much criticized as turbulence is a phenomenon associated with disorder and would not spontaneously produce the highly ordered structure required by the hypothesis. As well, it does not provide a solution to the angular momentum problem and does not explain lunar formation nor other very basic characteristics of the Solar System.|$|E
2500|$|Nanoconcrete {{is created}} by high-energy mixing (HEM) of cement, sand and water. To ensure the mixing is {{thorough}} enough to create nano-concrete, the mixer must apply a total mixing power to the mixture of 30 - 600 watts per kilogram of the mix. [...] This mixing must continue long enough to yield a net specific energy expended upon the mix of at least 5000 joules per kilogram of the mix. A plasticizer or a superplasticizer is then added to the activated mixture which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional concrete mixer. In the HEM process, the intense mixing of cement and water with sand provides <b>dissipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and increases shear stresses {{on the surface of}} cement particles. This intense mixing serves to divide the cement particles into extremely fine nanometer scale sizes, which provides for extremely thorough mixing. [...] This results in the increased volume of water interacting with cement and acceleration of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) colloid creation.|$|E

2500|$|The atomic {{theory of}} matter had been {{proposed}} {{again in the}} early 19th century by the chemist John Dalton {{and became one of}} the hypotheses of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases developed by Clausius and James Clerk Maxwell to explain the laws of thermodynamics. The kinetic theory in turn led to the statistical mechanics of Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) and Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839–1903), which held that energy (including heat) was a measure of the speed of particles. [...] Interrelating the statistical likelihood of certain states of organization of these particles with the energy of those states, Clausius reinterpreted the <b>dissipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> to be the statistical tendency of molecular configurations to pass toward increasingly likely, increasingly disorganized states (coining the term [...] "entropy" [...] to describe the disorganization of a state). The statistical versus absolute interpretations of the second law of thermodynamics set up a dispute that would last for several decades (producing arguments such as [...] "Maxwell's demon"), and that would not be held to be definitively resolved until the behavior of atoms was firmly established in the early 20th century. In 1902, James Jeans found the length scale required for gravitational perturbations to grow in a static nearly homogeneous medium.|$|E
60|$|It {{should be}} noted, too, that while to us who come after, the great complex {{evolutionary}} {{movement of the}} two last centuries justly reveals itself as one and indivisible, a single grand cosmical drama, having many acts and many scenes, but all alike inspired by one informing and pervading unity, yet to those whose half unconscious co-operation slowly built it up by episodes, piecemeal, each act and each scene unrolled itself separately {{as an end in}} itself, to be then and there attained and proved, quite apart from the conception of its analytic value as a part in a great harmonious natural poem of the constitution of things. Though evolution appears to us now as a single grand continuous process, a phase of the universe dependent upon a preponderating aggregation of matter and <b>dissipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> yet to Kant and Laplace it was the astronomical aspect alone that proved attractive, to Darwin it was the biological aspect alone, and to many of the modern workers in the minor fields it is the human and sociological aspect that almost monopolises the whole wide mental horizon. No greater proof can be given of the subjective distinctness of parts in what was objectively and fundamentally a single broad psychological revolution of the human mind, than the fact that Lyell himself, who more than any one man had introduced the evolutionary conception into the treatment of geology, should have stood out so long and fought so blindly against the evolutionary conception in the organic world. Indeed, {{it was not until the}} various scattered and many-coloured strands of evolutionary thought had been gathered together and woven into one by the vast catholic and synthetic intelligence of Herbert Spencer that the idea of evolution as a whole, as a single continuous cosmical process, began to be apprehended and gradually assimilated by the picked intelligences of the several distinct scientific departments.|$|E
