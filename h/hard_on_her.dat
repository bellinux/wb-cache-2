In September 2000, she underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum in her hip. She said her hip problem had been misdiagnosed for several years. Lipinski suffered another hip injury in 2002 during a Stars on Ice show in St. Louis, when she fell <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> right hip during a jump, and then tore muscles around the bruised area the next day.|$|E
25|$|Sparhawk-Jones {{struggled}} with depression, like her father, {{and when she}} was not well she burned her paintings, which reduced the number of works available for sale. In 1913, Sparhawk-Jones had a mental breakdown and lived in the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane for three years. The experience was <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> and she was forever changed. Sparhawk-Jones was terrified and lonely at the asylum, and may have been subject to opium or sedative drugs. She moved in with her mother after she was released from the hospital in 1916. Sparhawk-Jones dealt with the losses of her teacher William Merritt Chase, who died in 1916, and Morton Shamburg, who died in 1918. She said that she did not work as an artist for about 12 years.|$|E

After spotting Kapoor at a party organised by Bombay Times, Karan decided to cast her immediately {{for the role of}} the glamorous diva, Poo. Kapoor stated that in her opinion, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... was primarily Kajol's film, and that her own character was a supporting one. In order to prepare for her role, she worked <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> dancing skills, as she did not want audiences to know that she could not dance well.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the singer}} has never {{mentioned}} physical abuse in her family, she had mentioned {{that her father}} was a disciplinarian and her stepmother was <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> Author Lucy O'Brien wrote in her book Madonna: Like an Icon that the song stemmed more from the emotional neglect that Madonna faced, with her father locked up in grief after Mrs. Ciccone died. When he married again, his new wife was wrapped up with her own children, so the older kids were often left to their own devices. O'Brien believed that for this reason, Madonna's girlhood would have been without much joy, and that [...] "Oh Father" [...] was a potent example of the singer using her imagination to escape from her troubled childhood, while blaming it on her father. Tony later said, [...] "Maybe I'm not the greatest father in the world, but life wasn't easy for us, and Nonni [...] knows all of this." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the light}} of the {{physical}} demands of performing in theatre Paige has said [...] "Musical theatre is the hardest thing any actor will ever do. [...] You become obsessive about sleeping, eating the right food, not speaking and giving yourself vocal rest and keeping exercised". Regarding the pressure of having to be in a fit condition to perform in theatre each night, she remarked [...] "you wouldn't want to read the letters people write when you're off and they're disappointed – it's so awful, the guilt one feels for not being there". As part of a rigorous routine before musical roles to look after her voice, Paige stops eating dairy products and drinking alcohol and works <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> fitness. After about three months into the production when her voice is tiring from performing, she withdraws from her normal social life, sometimes only communicating by notepad and fax. She never reads her reviews, finding that it is not helpful to hear too many opinions of her work.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Stan herself, Șerban Cazan, LeAnna James, and Naz Tokio; the {{production}} was made by Cazan. It was composed during FonoCamp 2013, the first international songwriting camp in Romania which was organized by both Fonogram and HaHaHa Studios and held in Azuga. Fellow Romanian and international singers were also present at the two-weeks event, such as Delia Matache, Mohombi, Smiley and Deepcentral. The track was mixed for HaHaHa Production and recorded at Fonogram Studios and HaHaHa Studios. In an interview in Barcelona, Spain, Stan described the song as [...] "more oriental, {{with a lot of}} spiritual meaning". She continued to explain that [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] was written as a present for her Arabic and Asian fans due to the song's vibe. According to Pop Shock, the track is a Caucasian-flavoured mid-tempo ballad. Lyrically, Stan tells her unidentified boyfriend not to be so <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> and if he really loves her, he needs to give her his everything. The chorus of [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] consists solely of the phrase [...] "Don't you be so hard on me / If you love me, come and give me your everything".|$|E

500|$|Further success came to Adams {{when she}} reteamed with David O. Russell {{in the crime}} film American Hustle, co-starring Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, and Jennifer Lawrence. Inspired by the 1970s Abscam scandal, the film {{featured}} Adams in the rare glamorous part of a seductive con artist, though she played it so that [...] "everything felt justified and it didn't feel like {{she was just a}} sexy sociopath". She collaborated closely with Bale to build their characters and made off-screen suggestions to Russell, including for a scene in which she is aggressively kissed on the lips by her lover's wife (played by Lawrence). The experience was grueling for Adams, who later admitted that Russell had been too <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> and had made her cry frequently; she said that she regretted bringing such a negative experience home to her daughter. American Hustle was acclaimed by critics; Manohla Dargis of The New York Times believed that Adams [...] "goes deeper here than she's ever been allowed to" [...] and wrote that she had successfully [...] "turn an unpredictable character into a thrillingly wild one". She won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical and received her fifth Oscar nomination (her first for Best Actress). Her and American Hustle were deemed by critics to be among the best films of 2013, and they were both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E
2500|$|After {{learning}} that Penthouse would be publishing these photos, the Miss America Organization responded by giving Williams 72 hours to resign. Williams later stated that [...] "the heightened spectacle and circus {{of it all}} was kind of crazy. I had people saying 'Fight for the crown! Fight for the crown!' and people chanting 'Don't give it up! Don't secede!' [...] " [...] Williams also later noted that the situation was particularly <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> mother Helen, who felt that she should not resign as Williams had performed her [...] "duties and excelled at everything I was asked to do plus doing 50% more of appearances that were not scheduled because I was the first African American Miss America." [...] Helen was also upset that [...] "the pageant {{did not come to}} my support, they felt I needed to resign." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{appeared}} on The Lucy Show from 1962 to 1965, as Vivian Bagley, a divorced {{mother of one}} son, sharing a house with Ball's character. The character was the first divorcee ever on a weekly American television series. The strain of commuting {{from her home in}} Connecticut to Hollywood was too <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> In the third season, Vance did not appear in seven of the season's 26 episodes. In 1965, after completing her third year on the series, Vance decided to leave. At the start of the 1965–66 season, the format of the sitcom had changed. The [...] "Lucy" [...] character moved out to Los Angeles. Vivian Bagley remarried and her son, her new husband, and she remained in Danfield. Before she departed the show, Vance was offered a new contract with Desilu Studios, giving her the opportunity to direct. This never came to fruition as Vance could not reach an agreement on salary. She made only three more guest appearances on the remaining seasons of The Lucy Show.|$|E
50|$|Unlike Jim, she {{was much}} <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> now-deceased {{daughter}} Amanda, but more gentle and tactful with Wyatt, though she will not tolerate his more extreme behaviors. Because of her position in high society and connections with people in power, Katheryn is more than able to help friends in need, such as her best friend Hanna. Almost two years after losing Amanda to suicide, Katheryn had almost lost Wyatt to his own demons. In this case, he was presumed dead after a drug overdose, but was later revealed to still be alive and was only unconscious for 32 hours.|$|R
5000|$|In modern novels, popular hero archetypes are Arab sheikhs, Italian billionaires, Greek tycoons, and princes. According to Mills & Boon author Sharon Kendrick, [...] "the sheikh {{represents}} the ultimate female fantasy-dark, autocratic, completely powerful, outrageously chauvinistic." [...] Penny Jordan {{adds that the}} hero often has a softer side, which the heroine will discover {{during the course of}} the novel: [...] "He's often damaged by something that's happened in his life, often to do with money. He will be more outrageous to the heroine, and <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> He realises he is beginning to feel, he has to resolve that conflict." ...|$|R

2500|$|Smailey {{says he has}} {{no desire}} to be <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> but that [...] "it is a fraud". Ruth points out he was guilty of fraud, and she has {{evidence}} to prove it. Smailey tries to buy it from her, but she's respectable now: She won't take his money, though she keeps the papers as she [...] "ain't a fool"; Smailey leaves. Fitz-Partington interviews Ruth, to her confusion. Mrs. Van Brugh re-enters, and Fitz-Partington warns her about Smailey, explaining that his detective agency was called on to find out about Smailey's fraud, but as Smailey then hired him to investigate Mrs. Van Brugh, they had combined the cases. However, Fitz-Partington goes on to ask several further questions about Mrs. Van Brugh's marriage, and she begins to realise what Smailey is looking for: if Mrs. Van Brugh's godfather had called her Captain Van Brugh's wife in his will, her secret might be revealed. Smailey returns with the will, and reads out the relevant section about the farm, ending with the section referring to her as [...] "Catherine Ellen, wife of Captain Richard Van Brugh." [...] She faints into a chair.|$|E
2500|$|Fitz-Partington {{arrives with}} news of a new plan by Smailey: he plans to prosecute Mrs. Van Brugh for bigamy, having refused to believe her, and, to that end, has advertised for Captain Van Brugh's first wife's burial certificate. Mrs. Van Brugh is roused to anger by this, and {{declares}} that she will [...] "be punished no further". [...] Fitz-Partington leaves. Dr. Athelney announces the imminent arrival of his son and Fred, and Eve runs to Fred, crying that {{she knew he would}} come. He declares himself unable to control his father. He says he had lain awake all night, trying to think of how to lighten the burden on Eve and, finally, came to realise what he must do: Release her from her engagement to {{a member of the family}} that has been so <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> Eve faints. Dr. Athelney begins berating him and declares that [...] "I have been a clergyman of the Church of England for five and forty years, and, until today, I have never regretted the restrictions that my calling has imposed upon me. [...] My hands, sir, are tied. Ted, my boy, these remarks do not apply to you." [...] Ted seizes Fred and berates him. Mrs. Van Brugh asks Dr. Athenley to stop Ted, but Dr. Athelney is [...] "too fond of plain truth, and hears it far too seldom to stop it when he does hear it." ...|$|E

50|$|Once in Spain Jane {{became a}} {{lightning}} rod for exiled English Catholics. Jane kept up her correspondence with Elizabeth, but she also received letters from four popes and maintained numerous other contacts sympathetic to the Roman Catholic cause in England, and within Spain she was a champion of exiled English fallen <b>on</b> <b>hard</b> times. <b>On</b> <b>her</b> husband's death in 1571 she took over the management of his estates. The Spanish respected her for her political understanding, and 1592 she was a strong candidate to take up the governorship of Flanders.|$|R

Father and mother saw with sad dismay The meaning of their riches melt away; For without Lisa what would sequins buy? What wish were left if Lisa were to die? Through her they cared for summers still to come, Else they would be as ghosts without a home In any flesh that could feel glad desire. They pay the best physicians, never tire Of seeking what will soothe her, promising That aught she longed for, {{though it were a}} thing Hard to be come at as the Indian snow, Or roses that on Alpine summits blow, It should be hers. She answers with low voice, She longs for death alone--death is her choice; Death is the king who never did think scorn, But rescues every meanest soul to sorrow born.|$|R
