25|$|Also {{known as}} Generation 3 Omni VII and Generation 3+, {{following}} the issues experienced with generation IV technology, Thin Film technology became {{the standard for}} current image intensifier technology. In Thin <b>Film</b> <b>image</b> intensifiers, {{the thickness of the}} film is reduced from around 30 Angstrom (standard) to around 10 Angstrom and the photocathode voltage is lowered. This causes fewer electrons to be stopped than with third generation tubes, while providing the benefits of a filmed tube.|$|E
500|$|About the {{background}} score, Kukunoor said that [...] "to put soaring music {{to give it}} a larger-than-life <b>film</b> <b>image</b> was pretty difficult". Despite this worry, with Salim-Sulaiman composing the music, he was happy with the way it was composed according to the sequence. Karsan Saquria, Sunidhi Chauhan and a Pakistani singer, Shafqat Amanat Ali Khan were among those who sang the songs. While releasing the soundtrack, Kukunoor said that Salim-Sulaiman and he tried make songs that [...] "stood out from the clutter and something that was different from the item numbers or the boring love ballads." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{create the}} Mummy, Berton used a {{combination}} of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, [...] "When you see his <b>film</b> <b>image,</b> that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing {{and you can see}} right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it was so hard to do." [...] Vosloo described the filming as a [...] "whole new thing" [...] for him; [...] "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree." [...] Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.|$|E

2500|$|The broad term [...] "special effects" [...] {{includes}} all the techniques here, but more commonly {{there are two}} categories of effects. Visual effects ("VFX") involve photographic or digital manipulation of the onscreen image, usually done in post-production. Mechanical or physical effects involve props, pyrotechnics, and other physical methods used during principal photography itself. Some effects involved a combination of techniques; a ray gun might require a pyrotechnic during filming, and then an optical glowing line added to the <b>film</b> <b>image</b> in post-production. Stunts are another important category of physical effects. In general, all kinds of special effects must be carefully planned during pre-production.|$|E

2500|$|When Luis Buñuel {{died at age}} 83, his {{obituary}} in the New York Times {{called him}} [...] "an iconoclast, moralist, and revolutionary who was a leader of avant-garde surrealism in his youth and a dominant international movie director half a century later". [...] His first picture, Un Chien Andalou—made in the silent era—was called [...] "the most famous short film ever made" [...] by critic Roger Ebert, and his last film, That Obscure Object of Desire—made 48 years later—won him Best Director awards from the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics. [...] Writer Octavio Paz called Buñuel's work [...] "the marriage of the <b>film</b> <b>image</b> to the poetic image, creating a new reality...scandalous and subversive".|$|E
2500|$|Jeffreys {{says he had}} a [...] "eureka moment" [...] in his lab in Leicester {{after looking}} at the X-ray <b>film</b> <b>image</b> of a DNA {{experiment}} on 10 September 1984, which unexpectedly showed both {{similarities and differences between}} the DNA of different members of his technician's family. Within about half an hour, he continued, he realized the possible scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the genetic code to identify individuals. The method has become important in forensic science to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes. The method can also be applied to non-human species, for example in wildlife population genetics studies. Before his methods were commercialised in 1987, his laboratory was the only centre in the world that carried out DNA fingerprinting, and was consequently very busy, receiving inquiries from all over the globe.|$|E
2500|$|... "Full-frame" [...] is {{the same}} size as 35mm film (135 <b>film,</b> <b>image</b> format 24×36mm); these sensors are used in DSLRs such as the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II, 5DS/5DSR, 5D Mark IV and 6D Mark II, and the Nikon D5, D810, D750, D610 and Df. Most modern DSLRs use a smaller sensor that is APS-C sized, which is {{approximately}} 22×15mm, slightly smaller than the size of an APS-C film frame, or about 40% of the area of a full-frame sensor. Other sensor sizes found in DSLRs include the Four Thirds System sensor at 26% of full frame, APS-H sensors (used, for example, in the Canon EOS-1D Mark III) at around 61% of full frame, and the original Foveon X3 sensor at 33% of full frame (although Foveon sensors since 2013 have been APS-C sized). Leica offers an [...] "S-System" [...] DSLR with a 30×45mm array containing 37 million pixels. This sensor is 56% larger than a full-frame sensor.|$|E

2500|$|The sensors used {{in current}} DSLRs ("Full-frame" [...] {{which is the}} same size as 35mm film (135 <b>film,</b> <b>image</b> format 24×36mm), APS-C sized, which is {{approximately}} 22×15mm, and Four Thirds System) are typically much larger than the sensors found in other types of digital cameras. Entry-level compact cameras typically use sensors known as 1/2.5″, which is 3% the size of a full frame sensor. There are bridge cameras (also known as premium compact cameras or enthusiast point-and-shoot cameras) that offer sensors larger than 1/2.5″ but most still fall short of the larger sizes widely found on DSLR. Examples include the Sigma DP1, which uses a Foveon X3 sensor; the Leica X1; the Canon PowerShot G1 X, which uses a 1.5″ (18.7×14mm) sensor that is slightly larger than the Four Thirds standard and is 30% of a full-frame sensor; the Nikon Coolpix A, which uses an APS-C sensor of the same size as those found in the company's DX-format DSLRs; and two models from Sony, the RX100 with a 1″-type (13.2×8.8mm) sensor with about half the area of Four Thirds and the full-frame Sony RX1. These premium compacts are often comparable to entry-level DSLRs in price, with the smaller size and weight being a tradeoff for the smaller sensor.|$|E
