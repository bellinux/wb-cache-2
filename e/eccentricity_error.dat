Experimental testing of the computing method of clamping eccentric parameters proves that the computing method of clamping eccentric parameters is correct and feasible when the clamping eccentric value is within {{three quarters of the}} measurement range of the probe. The results of the clamping <b>eccentricity</b> <b>error</b> compensation experiment show that the clamping eccentric error compensation model can compensate measurement results to the results attained under operating conditions, and achieve precision measurement of involute profiles.

Radiographic measurement of wear {{is used to}} identify patients at risk and to assess prosthesis designs. This paper focuses on analysis of prostheses with cemented acetabular cups from anteroposterior radiographs. The articular surface of the femoral head and the acetabular rim marker are modelled as spherical and circular respectively, resulting in elliptical image projections. Methods for automatically localising these structures in radiographs are presented using robust ellipse fitting and various error functions. Special {{attention is paid to}} the acetabular marker since this often projects as a highly eccentric ellipse. Robust fitting enables successful localisation in the presence of clutter without the need for user interaction. Finally, the use of these ellipses as reference structures for wear estimation is investigated and the effect of <b>eccentricity</b> <b>errors</b> is highlighted. ...|$|R

An object circle is projected on to the image plane as an ellipse if the object plane and the image plane are not parallel to each other.

These co-ordinates are then used as observations for a subsequent reconstruction of the three dimensional object point.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a non-linear dynamic {{model for the}} study of the vibration signals generated by gear transmissions. The developed model considers both the parametric excitations due to the variable compliance of bearings and gears, can handle changes in the transmitted torque and allows the integration of the dynamic equations quickly and accurately. This model has been developed previously by the authors to assess the profile deviations on the dynamic behavior of gear transmissions and its influence on the transmitted torque. It also includes the presence of gear defects as cracks and pitting during the calculation of meshing forces. In this paper, the model has been enhanced in order to include two common defects such as index errors and run out or <b>eccentricity</b> <b>errors.</b> Index errors occur as a result of a non-uniform angular distribution of the tooth profiles along the pitch circle. Run out appears due to the displacement of the geometric center of the gear with respect to the center of rotation of the shaft on which it is mounted. Although both errors are caused by different reasons, sometimes they have been confused because of their similitudes. The procedure for including both kinds of errors in the model is described and simulations under several transmitted torques are presented. The results are assessed and compared focusing the attention on certain transmission parameters and magnitudes as transmission error, load forces in the tooth flanks and demodulation techniques on the resulting vibratory signals.

However, few studies have focused on the investigation of the position drift of the axis average line (AAL). In the present study, the AAL of the aerostatic bearing spindle is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. An error model is developed to analyze the errors which contribute to the error of depth of cut in slow tool servo assisted turning. Moreover, an experiment of microstructure fabrication is conducted to investigate the amplitude error of microstructures along both axial and radial direction of the cylindrical workpiece. The effects of spindle error motion, spindle unbalance induced <b>eccentricity,</b> thermal <b>error</b> and position drift of AAL are analyzed.

The new system can be easily built into a compact engineered version for applications in the industrial harsh environments of tube production. This system solves in a remarkable way the problem of measuring the eccentricity of a tube directly along the production line, without the need of machining it at the cut ends, and therefore reducing the amount of waste by means of the reduction in the time required to correct the process as a consequence of an <b>eccentricity</b> <b>error...</b>|$|E

Orbital elements {{for some of these}} objects have been derived using star [...] companion astrometry, and several of these appear to have eccentricities significantly greater than zero.

The magnitude of this effect is quantified in several regimes and we derive the maximum <b>eccentricity</b> <b>error</b> a third body could introduce in a general form, which may be easily applied to any imaged system. Criteria for identifying systems potentially susceptible to this scenario are presented, and we find that around half of the planets/companion brown dwarfs currently imaged could be liable to these errors when their orbital elements are derived.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The work of the author {{was to investigate the}} static, dynamic and machining behaviour of some new designs of slug damped boring bars with a 10 to 1 overhang ratio. The bars were mounted on a centre lathe. The static behaviour of a boring bar in relation to the geometric form errors that might be produced during boring was studied both analytically and experimentally. Specifically, two types of errors were considered, namely, a) errors that arise on entry of the boring tool into the workpiece) known as the "bell-mouth" errors; and b) reproducibility of <b>eccentricity</b> <b>errors,</b> known as the "copying" errors. The theory for "bell-mouth" errors did not seem to fit the results well; however, the theory did prove that such errors could exist. The theory for “copying” errors agreed remarkably well with the results provided that the initial eccentricity was small compared with the depth of cut. The dynamical behaviour of the slug damped boring bar was modelled by a mathematical analogue. Despite its inability to properly account for the compressibility effect of the gaseous damping fluid, the model revealed the possibility of design improvements. In consequence, the optimally-tuned slug-damped tungsten-bunged bar was conceived, Manufactured and tested along with a solid bar for comparison purposes, a slug-damped recessed bar and a slug-damped steel-bunged bar. The machining behaviour of a boring bar was studied in terms of the maximum depth of cut that it could cope before the occurrence of chatter. At first, a stability model was developed based on the mathematical analogue formulated {{in the study of the}} dynamical behaviour. But since this analogue did not fit the results accurately, a second and more precise model was set up using the frequency response obtained from dynamic experiments instead. The concept of negative damping coefficient was used; and a one-to-one correspondence between the asymptotic value of the negative damping coefficient and the limiting depth of cut was found to exist. By virtue of this, it is in principle possible to predict the limiting depth of cut of any machine tool system whose frequency response characteristics are known. Compared with other bars tested, the optimally-tuned tungsten-bunged bar was found to have the best dynamic and machining characteristics as reflected in the limiting depth of cut of 0. 10511 (2. 67 mm) to 0. 110 " (2. 79 mm) at the feed of 0. 0065 "/rev (0. 165 mm/rev) and the speed of 500 rprn on a 3. 5 " dia. bore (140 m/min) of EN 8 steel.

40|$|AbstractThe {{electric}} potential recorded {{on the brain}} cortex results from the generation of sources of current. However, {{it depends on the}} reference electrode chosen and devices used.

Another way of avoiding the reference dependence is to compute the scalp current density as surface Laplacian of the electroencephalogram. In practice, the value of the potential is known in a given number of electrodes, but the information about the density is not explicit. By using different interpolation methods by multivariate splines, formulae for the approximation of the density are obtained. These procedures are tested on a theoretical model of brain electrical potential given by the current of a single dipole inside the skull.

These errors are studied by performing dipole source localisation for simulated electrode potentials in a spherical head model, for a range of different dipole locations and for two different numbers (27 and 148) of electrodes. Dipole source localisation is performed by iteratively minimising the residual energy (RE), using the simplex algorithm. The ratio of the dipole localisation error (cm) to the noise level (%) of Gaussian measurement noise amounts to 0. 15 cm/% and 0. 047 cm/% for the 27 and 148 electrode configurations, respectively, for a radial dipole with 40 % <b>eccentricity</b> The localisation <b>error</b> due to noise can be reduced by taking into account multiple time instants of the measured potentials.

40|$|There is {{no simple}} and perfect way to measure {{residual}} stresses in metal parts that have been welded or deformed to make complex structures such as pressure vessels and aircraft, yet these locked-in stresses can contribute to structural failure by fatigue and fracture. However, one proven and tested technique for determining the internal stress of a metal part is to drill a test hole while measuring the relieved strains around the hole, such as the hole-drilling strain gage method described in ASTM E 837. The program HOLEGAGE processes strain gage data and provides additional calculations of internal stress variations that are not obtained with standard E 837 analysis methods. The typical application of the technique uses a three gage rosette with a special hole-drilling fixture for drilling a hole {{through the center of}} the rosette to produce a hole with very small gage pattern <b>eccentricity</b> <b>error.</b> Another device is used to control the drilling and halt the drill at controlled depth steps. At each step, strains from all three strain gages are recorded. The influence coefficients used by HOLEGAGE to compute stresses from relieved hole strains were developed by published finite element method studies of thick plates for specific hole sizes and depths. The program uses a parabolic fit and an interpolating scheme to project the coefficients to other hole sizes and depths. Additionally, published experimental data are used to extend the coefficients to relatively thin plates. These influence coefficients are used to compute the stresses in the original part from the strain data. HOLEGAGE will compute interior planar stresses using strain data from each drilled hole depth layer. Planar stresses may be computed in three ways including: a least squares fit for a linear variation with depth, an integral method to give incremental stress data for each layer, or by a linear fit to the integral data (with some surface data points omitted) to predict surface stresses before strain gage sanding preparations introduced additional residual stresses. Options are included for estimating the effect of hole eccentricity on calculations, smoothing noise from the strain data, and inputting the program data either interactively or from a data file. HOLEGAGE was written in FORTRAN 77 for DEC VAX computers under VMS, and is transportable except for system-unique TIME and DATE system calls. The program requires 54 K of main memory and was developed in 1990. The program is available on a 9 -track 1600 BPI VAX BACKUP format magnetic tape (standard media) or a TK 50 tape cartridge.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{infinite}} impulse response adaptive notch filtering and {{its application to}} the industrial problem of roll eccentricity signal estimation and retrieval. A minimal notch filter parametization is examined {{and a number of}} modifications are proposed which serve to enhance the notch filter characteristics and hence its usefulness. Firstly, a special constraint is introduced which allows the notch filter to be converted into a line enhancer without requiring structural changes. A further advantage associated with this modification is that the notch filter becomes a minimum phase filter. Secondly, a normalizing gain factor is introduced which ensures unity gain everywhere except at the notch frequency even for wide bandwidths. Thirdly, a design procedure together with design graphs are developed to assist in the design of notch filters. Estimation accuracy of the modified adaptive notch filter is analysed by deriving the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for the multiple cascaded notch filter model. Theoretical values are obtained for the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound and verified by extensive simulation results. A performance comparison of three adaptive algorithms (proposed by previous researchers) is carried out under the same conditions to establish the merits of each algorithm. The thesis then considers a simpler class of adaptive algorithms and applies these to notch filtering for the first time. The algorithms of interest are in fact gradient-based algorithms. Two novel notch filter model structures are synthesized which have special applicability to the roll <b>eccentricity</b> problem. The <b>error</b> surfaces associated with these model structures are analysed and Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to ascertain their performance. Results show that gradient-based adaptive notch filtering offers a number of distinct advantages including simplicity and robustness over other methods. Finally, the roll eccentricity problem is examined in detail and a new software sensor is proposed as a solution. The sensor is made up of a gradient-based adaptive comb filter which is constructed from 2 nd order notch filter modules. The comb filter estimates and tracks the harmonic series characterizing the roll eccentricity phenomenon. Once the harmonic series is retrieved a standard recursive least squares algorithm is implemented to estimate the amplitude and phase of each harmonic component. The sensor is subjected to extensive simulation trials with typical data being obtained from an operational plant. Results are conclusive and indicate that the proposed sensor offers an excellent {{solution to the problem of}} roll eccentricity signal retrieval...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the {{determination}} of the gravitational-waves signal emitted by binary neutron stars when they finally merge to form either a Black Hole or a remnant neutron star that will, likely, eventually also collapse to Black Hole. This research is based on the use of general relativistic numerical simulations that are the only tool available to study the evolution of a binary neutron star system through its coalescent, merger and post-merger phase. In particular, the gravitational signal emitted by different initial binary neutron star configurations has been analysed, evaluating the effects on the signal due to the total mass, the mass ratio, the equation of state and the initial stellar separation. The research focused on the post-merger phase, were analytical descriptions of the GW signal are still absent, both in the case when a (hyper) massive neutron star or a black hole surrounded by an accretion disk is formed. The gravitational waves phase evolution, the radiated energy and angular momentum and the post-merger gravitational waves spectrum have been determined. In particular, {{in the case of the}} post-merger gravitational signal, various possible interpretation of its spectral features have been analysed performing a close comparison with the recent literature. Emphasis has been given to analysing some sources of systematic errors, such as the initial data, the orbital <b>eccentricity,</b> the finite-resolution <b>errors</b> in the time evolution determined by the choice of different numerical methods, and the gravitational waves extraction methodology. For the latter, several data analysis techniques were developed, applied and extensively tested on the simulation data. The main interest for this research topic comes from the fact that binary neutron star mergers are the main target for Earth-based gravitational waves interferometric detectors, after the recent first detection of a gravitational signal from binary black hole mergers. They are characterized by a rich phenomenology, which includes microphysical effects and electromagnetic emissions. In particular, the most interesting challenge is to constraint the equation of state of the nuclear matter inside the neutron star core, which is still unknown from a theoretical point of view. In order to recognize a GW signal inside the detectors noise and perform source parameters estimation from it, the comparison with theoretical models coming from numerical simulations is a necessary and essential tool. This work has a central point on the study of binary neutron star simulations with public codes, in particular the The Einstein Toolkit and the LORENE library. All the code enhancements for the binary initial data and evolution, the parameter files, and the post-processing scripts developed for this work have been made publicly available, making all the results presented here reproducible, following the simple instructions described in the appendix...|$|R
