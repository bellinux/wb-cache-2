6000|$|... "Just so. The {{conditions}} are very hard, Mr. Wharton. <b>It</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> {{that such a}} one as you should think it right to separate a husband from his wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{how would}} you have me take <b>it?</b> Should <b>it</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> to {{discover}} that I had a mother? After all, a mother is an indispensable necessity to getting one's self born." ...|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE (solemnly). She will recover. May I say, ma'am, <b>it</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> {{that any}} one should see much {{resemblance}} {{between you and your}} Aunt Phoebe. Miss Phoebe is decidedly shorter and more thick-set.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, papa! <b>It</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> very much. Even Mr. Parsons {{knew nothing}} of his plans, Robert only wrote to me when it was done, that now he hoped to save {{a few of the}} {{children}} that are turned out in the streets to steal.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> to {{hear him}} speak so, for the {{virulence}} of feeling against the new French Emperor in England exceeded all belief, and high and low were united in their hatred of him; but the sailor soon gave me a clue to his politics.|$|E

"Spring {{advanced}} rapidly; {{the weather}} became fine and the skies cloudless. <b>It</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom {{with the most}} beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty.|$|E
60|$|DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 15th is just received. <b>It</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> {{that you}} have written twice, without {{receiving}} an answer. I have answered all I ever received from you; and certainly one since my return from the East.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> that {{in none of}} the philosophic {{writings}} of the learned scholars of antiquity can I find that this matter of names has been touched upon, much less {{given the importance of}} which I account it to be deserving.|$|R
6000|$|... "True, boy, yet <b>it</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> {{that they}} succeeded in {{breaking}} into my cache, {{for it was}} made of heavy masses of stone, many of which required two and three men to lift them, even with the aid of handspikes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A plot, Mary! Oh, what {{a mistake}} you are making! I {{have not seen}} Captain Horton for weeks, and {{had no idea that}} he meant to call on me here. Your visit was also unexpected, Mary, and <b>it</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> when I came in and found you here a few minutes ago." ...|$|E
60|$|Master {{began to}} talk about me. <b>It</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me,</b> the way he praised me. I hadn't a {{suspicion}} he admired me so much. From what he said you would have thought I had won prizes and ribbons at the Crystal Palace. But the man didn't seem to be impressed. He kept on saying nothing.|$|E
60|$|I confess I {{took this}} ill. It was a rude awakening. I {{had begun to}} regard myself as the special {{favourite}} of a fairy godmother; <b>it</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> to find that any undertaking of mine did not succeed immediately. However, reflecting that my fairy godmother's name was really Enterprise, I recalled Mr. Cyrus W. Hitchcock's advice, and advertised.|$|E

6000|$|... "I fancy you are depreciating {{yourself}} too much. But <b>it</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> to {{hear that}} you don't sing. I always fancy that I can distinguish a musical person in a crowd, and you, in the expression of your face, in your movements, {{and most of all}} in your voice, seemed to reveal the musical soul." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> that Jacob was not utterly cast {{down by the}} {{possibility}} {{that his father had}} already been carried to the Indian village, for once there we could not hope to effect a rescue; but since this thought had, apparently, never come into his mind, it was not for me to add to his distress by suggesting it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where {{did they}} see him?" [...] says the old man; and when I {{looked up to}} see how HE come to take an intrust in a little thing like that, his eyes was just burning into me, he was that eager. <b>It</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> so it kind of throwed me off, but I pulled myself {{together}} again and says: ...|$|E
6000|$|Now he'll flare up, said I to myself; he's so confoundedly {{independent}} and touchy {{no one can}} say a word to him. <b>It</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> when he answered quietly, [...] "Yes, mother, I know, but I must finish this book now; it will be the last novel I shall read for some years." [...] And so it was, I believe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps two {{or three}} weeks, {{certainly}} not more. After the Easter recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, {{will have to go}} up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will accompany him: <b>it</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> that he has already made so protracted a stay at Thornfield." ...|$|R
3000|$|... ‘I really don’t {{know what}} to make of these,’ said Norman as he sorted through his Christmas post. ‘It seems what I get more letters and parcels than what I know people, <b>it</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> more and more each year, as more of these parcels keep coming. I really don’t know who-all they bloody are—sending me all these.’ [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "That man," [...] {{explained}} Chatterton, [...] "is, I blush to say, {{a relative}} of my own, and given to complaining that times are bad. <b>It</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> {{that he does not}} find them ruinous, if this is a sample of his enterprise. I'm almost as much cut up as you are about this affair; and I'm sorry for you, Maxwell." ...|$|R
60|$|The Sand Lady and Walkirk went in {{the boat}} to fish. The latter had been very prompt to accept the invitation. I {{do not know whether}} the Shell Man went with them or not.

6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said Junius. [...] "I had no {{difficulty}} in understanding it, although I {{must say that}} <b>it</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> But I came because I am {{not satisfied with the}} condition of things here, and I wish to be on the spot. I do not understand why you and Miss March should be invited here during my absence." ...|$|E
6000|$|I am {{very glad}} {{of what you}} tell me about the certain [...] gentleman, because I don't think I could have been happy [...] at Stalham if he had been there. <b>It</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> so much [...] that I could not think that he meant it in earnest. We [...] never hardly spoke to each other {{when we were in the}} house [...] together.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So Jerry and me pikes off, {{and once}} more we prepares to settle down around the board. I hadn't noticed Jerry particular, but just now I catches sight of {{his face in the}} light of the lamp. Ever see one of those fighters when he's sitting in his corner before a fight, waiting for the gong to go? Well, Jerry looks like that; and <b>it</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R

"Smith," [...] said he, with a grave smile, [...] "if you {{cannot be}} happy {{unless you are}} laboring in the forest with your ax you must proceed with your wood-cutting; but I confess <b>it</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> as much to see you {{going to work on}} a day like this, as it would to see you walking {{inverted}} on your hands, and dangling your heels in the air." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{received}} {{me with a}} great shout of laughter. He {{seemed to}} think my joining as an officer the greatest joke in the world. There was a difference of ten years between us, and I suppose he remembered me best in pinafores. I was a kid of four when he first went to sea. <b>It</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> to find how boisterous he could be.|$|E
60|$|To {{the reply}} that the rats were {{slaughtered}} {{and the wind}} stopped out, Jane returned a look of compassion; but the subject was dropped, as {{it was supposed to}} be the right thing to hush up, instead of fostering, any popular superstition; but <b>it</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> that, as all our servants were fresh importations, they should so soon have become imbued with these undefined alarms.|$|E
60|$|I {{watched a}} man tearing down {{the brick wall}} of a house that did not appear very old; but <b>it</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> to see how crumbly the brick-work was, one stroke of his pick often {{loosening}} several bricks in a row. It is my opinion that brick houses, after a moderate term of years, stand more by habit and courtesy than through any adhesive force of the old mortar.|$|E
5000|$|It's hard {{to break}} the {{patterns}} in my workspace, where the TV presenters need to be direct, and neutral in some topics. <b>It</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> when people say we are opinion leaders, but actually we the opinion leaders can't say anything but sillinesses, unrelated to deeper issues which interest the country. I have not rebelled, I just think that a presenterI have to change my mind. Felipe Camiroaga ...|$|R
