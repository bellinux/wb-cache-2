On the other hand, bio-fuels are getting impetus today as renewable substitutes for conventional fuels, especially in the transport sector. In the present work, experimental tests were conducted all the authors' laboratory on a bus/truck, turbocharged diesel engine in order to investigate the formation mechanisms of nitric oxide (NO), smoke, and combustion noise radiation during <b>hot</b> <b>starting</b> for various alternative fuel blends. To this aim, a fully instrumented test bed was set up, using ultra-fast response analyzers capable of capturing the instantaneous development of emissions as well as various other key engine and turbocharger parameters. The experimental test matrix included three different fuels, namely neat diesel fuel and two blends of diesel fuel with either bio-diesel (30 % by vol.) or n-butanol (25 % by vol.). With reference to the neat diesel fuel case during the starting event, the bio-diesel blend resulted in deterioration of both pollutant emissions as well as increased combustion instability, while the n-butanol (normal butanol) blend decreased significantly exhaust gas opacity but increased notably NO emission.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if radar data assimilation might be able to aid in the prediction of flash flood events before the corresponding heavy rain events occur. Twelve heavy rainfall events that occurred over the state of Iowa during the warm season between 2001 and 2011 were simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Two 24 -hour high resolution (4 km) WRF simulations were run for each heavy rainfall event, one where radar data was not assimilated (cold start) and one where radar data was assimilated at the time of model initialization (<b>hot</b> <b>start).</b> In order to get a measure of the forecast accuracy, equitable threat scores (ETS) and bias were calculated for the <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> and the cold start rainfall forecasts for each case. The ETS and bias were calculated for several different rainfall thresholds in order to see if forecasting skill might differ between the different rainfall thresholds. Other statistics such as rainfall volume, rate, and areal coverage were analyzed along with plots of the rainfall amounts and post processed reflectivity. The degree of accuracy present in the cold <b>start</b> and <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> model quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) was discussed along with some problems that were consistently present in the model simulation for all of the heavy rain events. Then Plots of a Flood Severity Index (showing areas where flash flooding would be predicted) were created for the heavy rainfall cases using a hydrology model forced with Stage IV rainfall (high resolution rainfall analysis), <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> run QPF, and cold start run QPF for comparison and analysis. Additionally, <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> and cold start WRF simulations (these were only 12 -hours simulations) were run for two more heavy rain cases that occurred in the warm season of 2010. A probability matched mean rainfall forecast was also produced from a mixed physics model and compared with QPFs from <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> and cold start model runs for these two additional heavy rain cases in order to see if one method provided greater improvement in forecast skill. Overall, the radar data assimilation resulted in increased accuracy in model QPF for the initial 12 heavy rainfall cases simulated. As a result the rainfall forecasts from the <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> runs yielded higher ETSs than for the cold start runs, although the heaviest rainfall areas generally saw less of an increase in ETS from cold <b>start</b> to <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> and had fairly low ETSs for most cases. A couple significant problems were noted in the <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> runs, one being that the runs were far too wet in the first hour or two for each case and another being that thunderstorms/rain areas created from radar-assimilation and not present in the cold start simulation tend to dissipate too soon. Analyzing the hydrology model-predicted flash flooding for all 12 cases revealed that as one might expect the rainfall from the <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> runs yielded fairly accurate flash flood predictions (in terms of general placement and intensity) for a few of the better forecasted (in terms of rainfall) cases, while placement and intensity discrepancies existed for many of the cases when compared with the flash flooding produced via the Stage IV rainfall. One encouraging finding regarding the hydrology model runs forced with the <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> rainfall was that they predicted flash flooding at some point during the 24 -hour simulations in all 12 cases, and this was also true when the Stage IV rainfall was used. Implying that one might be able to say with fairly good certainty that a rain event will produce flash flooding (even if location and intensity isn 2 ̆ 7 t known) based on the <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> runs, whereas the same can 2 ̆ 7 t be said for the cold <b>start.</b> Comparison of <b>hot</b> <b>start,</b> cold start and PM rainfall forecasts for the additional two heavy rain cases revealed that the <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> and PM rainfall forecasts both had a greater level of skill and were more accurate than the cold start rainfall forecasts for the two events. The <b>hot</b> <b>start</b> rainfall forecasts did a better job of placement and areal coverage (and had higher ETSs) for the entire precipitating region (lower rainfall thresholds), while the PM forecasts generally was more skillful (higher ETSs) in placement of the heaviest rainfall areas (highest rainfall thresholds). This is an important finding since it implies that the PM approach may be better than radar data assimilation alone for forecasting the heavy rainfall areas that are usually the most important when it comes to the potential for flash flooding...|$|R

40|$|We compute grids of radiative-convective model atmospheres for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune over a {{range of}} {{intrinsic}} fluxes and surface gravities. The atmosphere grids serve as an upper boundary condition for models of the thermal evolution of the planets. Unlike previous work, we customize these grids for the specific properties of each planet, including the appropriate chemical abundances and incident fluxes {{as a function of}} solar system age. Using these grids, we compute new models of the thermal evolution of the major planets in an attempt to match their measured luminosities at their known ages. Compared to previous work, we find longer cooling times, predominantly due to higher atmospheric opacity at young ages. For all planets, we employ simple "standard" cooling models that feature adiabatic temperature gradients in the interior H/He and water layers, and an initially <b>hot</b> <b>starting</b> point for the calculation of subsequent cooling. For Jupiter we find a model cooling age 10 % longer than previous work, a modest quantitative difference. This may indicate that the hydrogen equation of state used here overestimates the temperatures in the deep interior of the planet. For Saturn we find a model cooling age 20 % longer than previous work. However, an additional energy source, such as that due to helium phase separation, is still clearly needed. For Neptune, unlike in work from the 1980 s and 1990 s, we match the measured Teff of the planet with a model that also matches the planet's current gravity field. This is predominantly due to advances in the equation of state of water. This may indicate that the planet possesses no barriers to efficient convection in its deep interior. However, for Uranus, our models exacerbate the well-known problem that Uranus is far cooler than calculations predict, which could imply strong barriers to interior convective cooling.

40|$|PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars) is a {{proposal}} submitted {{in response to}} the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015 - 2025 announcement of opportunity. Its objective is to detect and characterize exoplanets by means of their transit signature in front of a large sample of bright stars, and measure the seismic oscillations of their parent stars. In order to achieve the science goals, very stringent requirements on the pointing error must be met. This precise and stable pointing requires an accurate estimation of the spacecraft attitude. This estimation is based on different onboard attitude sensors which are subject to measurement noise and bias. Some sensors, e. g. sun sensors and magnetometers, provide only vector observations and the estimation of the spacecraft attitude is further complicated by the nonlinear spacecraft dynamics and quaternion kinematics. This paper presents the moving horizon estimation of the spacecraft state, and shows that it outperforms the extended and unscented Kalman filters, which are the current workhorse filters in the space industry. A moving horizon estimator determines the current state by solving a constrained numerical optimization problem considering a finite sequence of current and past measurement data, an available spacecraft dynamics model and quaternion kinematics constraints. A symplectic integrator is developed to preserve the quaternion norm over the estimation horizon. The onboard sensors run at different sampling rates. This can be dealt with in a natural way in the moving horizon estimator. The objective function to be minimized is typically a trade-off between minimizing measurement noise and process noise. In order to solve this constrained optimization problem in real-time, an efficient numerical solution method based on the iterative Gauss-Newton scheme has been implemented and specific measures are taken to speed up the calculations such as <b>hot</b> <b>starting</b> from previous solutions and exploiting the sparsity and band structure of matrices to be inverted. A technology demonstration for this attitude estimation algorithm is planned on one of the QB 50 cubesats, to be launched in 2013. This will be used to verify on-orbit performance before implementation in the PLATO flight software. Pre-launch performance validation of the technique has been carried out in a simulation environment for both missions. Efficient C++ code for implementation in the onboard attitude control software is developed and current research is aimed towards adaptive estimation of the external disturbance level. status: publishe...|$|E
