40|$|Standard {{approaches}} to designing a futures hedge often suffer from two major problems. First, they {{focus only on}} minimizing risk, so no account is taken of the impact on expected return. Second, in estima ting the hedge ratio, no allowance is made for time variation {{in the distribution of}} cash and futures price changes. This paper describes a technique for estimating the optimal futures hedge that corrects these problems and illustrates its use in <b>hedging</b> <b>Treasury</b> bonds with T-bond futures.

40|$|The Global Financial Stability Map was {{developed}} {{as a tool to}} interpret the risks and conditions that impact financial stability in a graphical manner. It complements other existing tools for assessing financial stability, and seeks to overcome some of the drawbacks of earlier approaches. This paper provides the motivation for the tool, a detailed discussion of its construction, including the choice of risk factors and conditions, a description of the underlying indicators, and a discussion on how the final assessment is determined. When applied to past events of financial instability, the Global Financial Stability Map performs reasonably well in signaling risks to stability, as well as in characterizing the depth of crisis episodes.

40|$|We develop {{alternative}} {{models for}} hedging yield curve risk and test them by <b>hedging</b> US <b>Treasury</b> bond portfolios through note/bond futures. We show that traditional implementations of models based on principal component analysis, duration vectors and key rate duration lead to high exposure to model errors and to sizable transaction costs, thus lowering the hedging quality. Also, this quality varies from one test {{case to the}} other, so that a clear ranking of the models is not possible. We show that accounting for the variance of modeling errors substantially reduces both hedging errors and transaction costs for all considered models.

40|$|We test {{alternative}} {{models of}} yield curve risk by <b>hedging</b> US <b>Treasury</b> bond portfolios through note/bond futures. We show that traditional implementations of models based on principal component analysis, duration vectors and key rate duration lead to high exposure to model errors and to sizable transaction costs, thus lowering the hedging quality. Also, this quality randomly varies from one model and hedging {{problem to the}} other. We show that accounting for the variance of modeling errors substantially reduces both hedging errors and transaction costs for all considered models. Additionally, it leads to much more stable weights in the hedging portfolios and - as a result - to more homogeneous hedging quality. On this basis, error-adjusted principal component analysis is found to systematically and significantly outperform alternative models. Yield curve risk Interest rate risk Immunization Hedging...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} settlement-date {{accounting}} for equity share options {{can be seen}} as an accounting method which implements a shareholder focused residually rewarded partners’ equity view. This equity view represents a simple, natural extension of the shareholder proprietary view. It implicates an equity and income sharing model for accounting which is characterized by specification of both shareholders’ and non-shareholders’ parts of total equity and income. When using this equity and income sharing model, the remeasurements of equity share option obligations made by settlement-date accounting are fully conceptually valid. They represent measurements of one partner group’s share of total equity with effect for another group’s share of total equity and income: the shareholders’ part. Partially, this equity and income sharing model is already the basis for existing accounting standards. It is shown that an intriguing implication of the equity and income sharing model is the fact that <b>treasury</b> shares can <b>hedge</b> present shareholders’ share price risk from the obligation to holders of equity share options. A special hedge accounting construct is needed to account for this hedge effect, and the construct of this model is shown. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the long run expense effects for shareholders from equity share options by settlement-date accounting both when the expense effects are unhedged and when they are <b>hedged</b> with <b>treasury</b> share holdings. The results demonstrate that the expenses resulting from settlement-date accounting for equity share option awards are significantly higher on average than the expenses resulting from grant-date accounting. And they show that the cost of equity, the share price volatility and the lifetime of the equity share options are important determinants for the size of the differences in total expenses, which in a long run perspective is to be expected from the use of these two alternative accounting models for equity share options. The simulation results demonstrate that <b>hedging</b> with <b>treasury</b> share holdings is very effective to stabilize expenses resulting from options granted to employeesNo keywords;...|$|R

Advanced treasury management examines liquidity management using various cash forecasting techniques, including cash budgeting, the distribution method, and cash modeling. The movement toward formalizing investment policies and credit decisions requires active participation by senior management and the treasurer, given the choices of lines of credit, commercial paper, asset-based lending and asset-based securities. The complexities of international treasury management, bank compensation and risk management are managed by such specialized tools as pooling, netting, and various <b>hedging</b> instruments. <b>Treasury</b> information systems provide extensive module choices, including basic treasury activities and such advanced functionality as debt and investment management, and the capability for automated intra-company data transfer. Bank relationship management uses a comprehensive approach to the bank-corporate partnership, including requests-for-proposals which are increasingly used to bid treasury services. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|We propose using {{model-free}} yield quadratic variation measures {{computed from}} intraday data {{as a tool}} for specification testing and selection of dynamic term structure models. We find that the yield curve fails to span realized yield volatility in the U. S. Treasury market, as the systematic volatility factors are largely unrelated to the cross-section of yields. We conclude that a broad class of affine diffusive, quadratic Gaussian, and affine jump-diffusive models cannot accommodate the observed yield volatility dynamics. Hence, the Treasury market per se is incomplete, as yield volatility risk cannot be <b>hedged</b> solely through <b>Treasury</b> securities.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} made of three {{articles}} dealing with two main subjects: the so called "Kernel Puzzle" {{and the problem of}} immunization of portfolio of treasury and corporate bonds. For the first topic, we provide a new method to derive the state price density per unit probability based on option prices and GARCH model. We derive the risk neutral distribution using the result in Breeden and Litzenberger (1978) and the historical density adapting the GARCH model of Barone-Adesi, Engle, and Mancini (2008). For the second topic, the first article deals with the immunization of a portfolio of treasury bonds against interest rate risk and in particular we test alternative models of yield curve risk by <b>hedging</b> US <b>Treasury</b> bond portfolios through note/bond futures. The last article deals with the problem of immunization of a portfolio of corporate bonds. We test here alternative strategies for hedging a portfolio composed from BBB-rated corporate bonds. Our results highlight a change of regime. From 2000 to 2007, a hedging strategy based only on T-bond futures would have reduced the variance of the portfolio by circa 83. 5 %. This compares well to the maximum variance reduction of 50 % reported by previous studies hedging corporate bonds through T-bond and S&P 500 futures...|$|R
40|$|Pronounced upward {{movements}} {{in interest rates}} can result in substantial losses for financial institutions which hold fixed interest rate assets. The {{purpose of this study}} is to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of alternative <b>hedging</b> strategies using <b>Treasury</b> bond futures and futures options in reducing the risk of holding mortgage positions;A simulation of Treasury bond futures options prices is undertaken using the Black model for pricing call options and the put-call parity equation for pricing put options. The estimated put prices are then used to estimate the risk-return distributions of put and call hedged positions. Alternative strategies which are evaluated in this study are hedging the cash position with Treasury bond futures contracts and the risk minimizing hedge ratio, hedging with futures contracts and stop orders on the contracts, hedging with futures contracts and buying call options on the contracts, and hedging with put options on the futures contracts. For each of the alternative options hedges the risk-return distributions are determined for different exercise prices of the options. The alternative strategies are then evaluated by comparing their respective risk-return distributions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{sheds light}} on the {{attractiveness}} of U. S. assets by studying dollar risk premiums, calculated using Consensus exchange rate forecasts, and linking them to bilateral capital flows. The paper finds {{that the presence of}} negative dollar risk premiums (i. e. expectations of a dollar depreciation net of interest rate effects) amid record capital inflows could suggest that investors may favor U. S. assets for structural reasons. One possible explanation could be that the Asian crisis created a large pool of savings searching for relatively riskless investment opportunities, which were provided by deep, liquid, and innovative U. S. financial markets with robust investor protection. Moreover, the continued attractiveness of U. S. financial markets to European investors suggests that they offer a large array of assets, with different risk/return characteristics, that facilitate the structuring of diversified investment portfolios. Looking forward, this suggests that the allocative efficiency of U. S. financial markets could mitigate risks of a disorderly unwinding of global current account imbalances.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters on mortgage funding and risk management. The U. S mortgage market is very concentrated. In 2006, the top 40 lenders were responsiblefor the origination of 96 percent of all mortgages (Stanton et al. (2014)). These large lendersoriginated about 60 percent of the mortgages through the wholesale channel, delegating partsof the origination process to third party agents such as mortgage brokers and correspondentlenders. I show {{that the type of}} agent selected by the wholesale lender could crowd outlocal banks, who often act as correspondents and rely on these wholesale lenders for funding. I also show that this crowding out has spillover eects. As local banks decreased theirpresence in the county, they have also reduced other types of lending. As a result, their localcommunities showed less growth in small businesses. The second chapter discusses the perils of warehouse lending. Warehouse lending is animportant part of the U. S. mortgage market because a large fraction of mortgage origination,both pre-crisis and currently, is carried out by non-depositories who are reliant on warehousefacilities to fund their mortgage origination activity. After the passage of The BankruptcyAbuse Prevention Act (BAPCPA), in April 2005, most warehouse facilities were structuredas Master Repurchase Agreements (MRAs). BAPCPA re-dened the mortgage loans heldas collateral on the warehouse lines (the newly originated mortgages) as repo thus exemptingthem from automatic stay upon the bankruptcy of the mortgage originator (the reposeller). We consider the eect of the growth of MRAs for funding mortgage originations onthe performance of the mortgage originators (repo sellers) and warehouse lenders (repo buyers). We nd that mortgage originators (repo sellers), that used MRAs to fund their loans,originated mortgages of lower quality and that these originators were more likely to declarebankruptcy. Symmetrically, we nd that the warehouse lenders (repo buyers) experienced asharper increase in mortgage charge-os and non-performing mortgages than non-warehouselenders, even though the quality of the retail and wholesale mortgages that they originatedwere comparable to the quality of mortgages originated by non warehouse lenders. Thisnegative outcome for warehouse lenders arose from the exemption of the mortgage repocollateral from automatic stay, since under BAPCPA the poor quality assets of bankrupt counter parties, the mortgage originators, became consolidated on the warehouse lender balancesheets. Thus, the consolidated loans from the bankrupt counter parties generated animportant component of the deterioration in the warehouse lenders' mortgageIn the third chapter, we propose an empirical duration measure for the stock of U. S. Agency MBS that appears to be less prone to model risk than measures such as the BarclaysEective Duration measure. We nd that this measure {{does not appear to have}} a strongeect on the 12 -month excess returns of ten-year Treasuries as would be expected if shocksto MBS duration lead to commensurate shocks to the quantity of interest rate risk borneby professional bond investors (see, Hanson, 2014; Malkhozov et al., 2016). Given thisnegative reduced form result, we then explore the mortgage and <b>treasury</b> <b>hedging</b> activitiesof the primary MBS investors such as commercial banks, insurance companies, the agencies,the Federal Reserve Bank, Mutual Funds, and foreign investors. We nd that the onlyinvestors that may follow the models of Hanson (2014) and Malkhozov et al. (2016) areforeign investors in Switzerland and the United Kingdom and life insurance rms. Lifeinsurance rm market share has declined over the period, dropping below 10 % since 1996 and reaching 4 % in 2016. Furthermore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom are not majorparticipants in the US Treasury market. Of the investors we are not able to study, hedgefunds and pensions/retirement funds are the two investor groups that may trade along theHanson (2014) and Malkhozov et al. (2016) models. However, although these two investorgroups held almost 25 % of the Agency MBS market (including households and non protorganizations) in the late 1990 s, post crisis their share has fallen below 10...|$|R
