5000|$|Virtuality's release {{surprised}} the existing VR industry. Despite crude graphics, it offered what Computer Gaming World in 1992 described as [...] "all the necessary hallmarks of a fully <b>immersive</b> <b>system</b> at what, to many, is a cheap price.

There is no hidden agenda by which teachers attempt to coerce or trick students into doing something. Students still make autonomous choices to participate in learning activities. The progress mechanics used in the gamified system {{can be thought of as}} lighting the way for learners as they progress, and the other game mechanics and elements of game design are set up as an <b>immersive</b> <b>system</b> to support and maximize students' learning.|$|E
5000|$|The first CAVE {{was invented}} by Carolina Cruz-Neira, Daniel J. Sandin, and Thomas A. DeFanti in 1992. This is an <b>immersive</b> <b>system</b> that became the {{standard}} for rear projection-based Virtual Reality systems. The normal full system consists of projections screens along the front, side and floor axes, and a tracking system for the [...] "user". Although they used the recursive acronym Cave Automatic Virtual Environment for the CAVE system, the name also refers to Plato's [...] "Republic" [...] and [...] "The Allegory of the Cave" [...] where he explored the concepts of reality and human perception.|$|E

50|$|On September 18, 2013, the new Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX officially opened. Airlines {{started to}} use the new, smarter gates that can handle larger aircraft, with {{multiple}} gates configured for the Airbus A380. Inside, Southern California scenes and eccentric videos are played on seven huge multimedia screens. It is the largest <b>immersive</b> <b>system</b> in an airport and the most advanced multimedia environment in a North American airport. This system was created by Moment Factory. Lounge-like seating for relaxation, and the 25,000-square-foot duty-free shopping area {{are located in the}} Great Hall. Many restaurants and high-end shops are located there, such as Chloé, Burberry, Fred Segal, and Porsche amongst others.

50|$|Participants in {{immersive}} constructs {{are typically}} {{represented in the}} form of a digital avatar, which can move freely through the virtually recreated scenario that represents the news story. This animated 3D digital representation allows them to see the world from the first-person perspective of that avatar. In an <b>immersive</b> <b>system</b> such as a Cave, individuals may see their own real body, with their avatar established through shadows and reflections in the environment (though other online people could also see the avatar directly.) In a system such as an HMD the participant will see their avatar as if it were actually their own body and they will be offered a first-person point of view. Ideally, depending on the extent of body tracking, the movements of the virtual body will match those of the movements on the person’s real body. The news story can be constructed to control how the participant may enter the story: as oneself, a visitor gaining first-hand access to a virtual version of the location where the story is occurring, or through the perspective of a character depicted in the story.|$|E

In this paper, we present a discussion of proxemics and kinesics to support based on observation of physical collaboration. We present our research agenda to investigate low-cost multi-sensory output cues to communicate proxemics and kinesics aspects cross-surface.

40|$|An {{immersive}} whiteboard {{system is}} presented in a networked collaborative environment where users at multiple locations can communicate with each other. The <b>immersive</b> <b>system</b> consists of five major components: the network, the virtual environment, the avatar representation, the multimedia objects, and the shared whiteboards. The virtual environment is shared among multiple networked users and allows each user to interact independently with the world. The avatar is used to represent each user in the immersive environment and conveys its user identity and facial expressions to the world. The shared whiteboards provide a medium for communication using handwritten inputs, {{as well as a}} desirable interface for navigation and mouse control. The goal of this <b>immersive</b> <b>system</b> is to provide a convenient environment for participants to interact with each other. The system is suitable for distance learning and conferencing applications because it uses the whiteboard interface and provides a user avatar representation for any virtual environment. 1...|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{applications}} are currently envisioned for <b>immersive</b> audio <b>systems.</b> The principal function of such systems is to synthesize, manipulate, and render sound fields in real time. In this paper, we examine several fundamental and technological limitations that impede {{the development of}} seamless <b>immersive</b> audio <b>systems.</b> Such limitations stem from signal-processing requirements, acoustical considerations, human listening characteristics, and listener movement.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} an {{approach}} that uses both two force sensitive handles (FSH) and a flexible capacitive touch sensor (FCTS) to drive a haptic-based <b>immersive</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>immersive</b> <b>system</b> has been developed {{as part of a}} multimodal interface for product design. The haptic interface consists of a strip that can be used by product designers to evaluate the quality of a 3 D virtual shape by using touch, vision and hearing and, also, to interactively change the shape of the virtual object. Specifically, the user interacts with the FSH to move the virtual object and to appropriately position the haptic interface for retrieving the six degrees of freedom required for both manipulation and modification modalities. The FCTS allows the system to track the movement and position of the user’s fingers on the strip, which is used for rendering visual and sound feedback. Two evaluation experiments are described, which involve both the evaluation and the modification of a 3 D shape. Results show that the use of the haptic strip for the evaluation of aesthetic shapes is effective and supports product designers in the appreciation of the aesthetic qualities of the shape...|$|E

Only three studies (17.6 %) used an <b>immersive</b> VR <b>system.</b> Participants interacted with the VR environment using input devices in many studies (e.g., zooming in and out, rotating, clicking, etc.). Regardless of the VR system type, all studies had their participants seated in a chair (either {{in front of a computer}} monitor in non-immersive systems or in a room wearing a headset in <b>immersive</b> <b>systems).</b> Therefore, the participants did not change their location physically when they interacted with the VR environments.|$|R

40|$|Athletes' {{performances}} {{are influenced by}} internal and external factors, including their psychological state and environmental factors, especially during competition. As a consequence, current training programs include stress management. In this paper, we explore whether highly <b>immersive</b> <b>systems</b> {{can be used for}} such training programs. First, we propose methodological guidelines to design sport training scenarios both on considering the elements that a training routine must have, and how external factors might influence the participant. The proposed guidelines are based on Flow and social-evaluative threat theories. Second, to illustrate and validate our methodology, we designed an experimental setup reproducing a ten meter Olympic pistol shooting. We analyzed whether changes in the environment are able to induce changes in user performance, physiological responses and the subjective perception of the task. The simulation included stressors in order to raise a social-evaluative threat, such as aggressive public behavior or unforced errors, increasing the pressure while performing the task. The results showed significant differences in their subjective impressions, trends in the behavioral and physiological data were also observed. Taken together, our results suggest that highly <b>immersive</b> <b>systems</b> could be further used for training in sports...|$|R
