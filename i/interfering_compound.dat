40|$|A {{mass spectrometric}} (MS) method for the {{identification}} of iron protoporphyrin (IX) (FePTP, heme b) in marine particulate material and phytoplankton is described. Electrospray ionisation of FePTP produced the molecular Fe(III) PTP+ ion (m/z = 616) or the pseudomolecular [Fe(II) PTP + H]+ ion (m/z = 617), depending on the oxidation state of the central iron ion. Collision induced dissociation (CID) in the ion trap mass spectrometer resulted in a single detected product ion (m/z = 557) indicative of loss of ethanoic acid from a carboxylic acid side chain. Widening the isolation width to 616 ± 3 resulted in production of a mass spectrum demonstrating the distinctive isotopic ratio of the iron containing fragment, further increasing the specificity of the analysis. Selective reactant monitoring (SRM) of the fragment ion (m/z = 557) {{was applied to the}} detection of FePTP after chromatography of ammoniacal OGP extracts of marine samples. The detection limit for FePTP analysed by SRM after chromatography was 1. 2 ± 0. 5 fmol. For phytoplankton samples, reasonably good agreement was achieved between results obtained with SRM and those obtained by monitoring absorbance at ? = 400 nm using a diode array detector (DAD). Use of SRM for analysis of particulate material obtained from the high latitude North Atlantic allowed for the analysis of FePTP {{in the presence of a}} co-eluting compound that interfered with detection by DAD. Simultaneous collection of mass spectra from m/z = 300 to 1500 resulted in identification of the pseudomolecular ion for the <b>interfering</b> <b>compound.</b> The CID fragmentation pattern and UV–visible mass spectra indicated that the <b>interfering</b> <b>compound</b> was a previously unidentified chlorin type compound. Comparison of FePTP determined by SRM and DAD on samples where this compound could not be detected showed that results collected using the two methods correlated. The use of both MS and DAD results in a powerful tool for quantifying this important biogenic component of the particulate iron pool...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Monitoring of {{treatment}} for patients diagnosed with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) can be performed by measuring the concentration of 17 ?-hydroxyprogesterone (17 OHP) in bloodspots collected on filter papers. A method is described here for measuring 17 OHP by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCMSMS). METHODS: 17 OHP was extracted by liquid-liquid extraction and analysed by LCMSMS. The method was validated for sensitivity, specificity, linearity, recovery, ion suppression, precision and bias. RESULTS: The standard curve was linear from 0 to 400 ?nmol/L. Intra-assay %CVs were < 10 and inter-assay %CVs were < 15 over the range 10 - 200 ?nmol/L. Limit of quantitation was 6 ?nmol/L. No ion suppression was detected. The only <b>interfering</b> <b>compound</b> detected was deoxycorticosterone, an intermediate steroid with the same molecular weight as 17 ?-hydroxyprogesterone. The method was more accurate and precise than an existing radioimmunoassay. There was poor correlation between the two assays.

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has two {{envelope}} proteins, E 1 and E 2, {{which form}} a heterooligomer. During dissection of interacting regions of HCV E 1 and E 2, {{we found the}} presence of an <b>interfering</b> <b>compound</b> or compounds in skim milk. Here we report that human as well as bovine lactoferrin, a multifunctional immunomodulator, binds two HCV envelope proteins. As determined by far- Western blotting, the bacterially expressed E 1 and E 2 could bind lactoferrin in human milk directly separated or immunopurified and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The bindings of lactoferrin and HCV envelope proteins in vitro were confirmed by another method, the pull-down assay, with immunoprecipitated lactoferrin-bound protein A resin. By the same assay, mammal-expressed recombinant E 1 and E 2 and were also demonstrated to bind human lactoferrin efficiently in vitro. Direct interaction between E 2 and lactoferrin was proved in vivo, since anti- human lactoferrin antibody efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with secreted and intracellular forms of the E 2 protein, but no glutathione S-transferase (GST), from lysates of HepG 2 cells transiently cotransfected with the expression plasmids of human lactoferrin and gE 2 t-GST (the N-terminal two- thirds of E 2 fused to GST) or GST. The N-terminal loop of lactoferrin, the region important for the antibacterial activity, has only a little role in the binding ability to HCV E 2 but affected the secretion or stability of lactoferrin.

Designing a novel ligand material for the target analyte and managing {{the composition of the}} internal reference solution have been the strategies employed here to produce {{for the first time a}} potentiometric-based direct reading method for an environmental drug contaminant. This concept has been applied to sulfamethoxazole (SMX), one of the many antibiotics used in aquaculture practices that may occur in environmental waters. The novel ligand has been produced by imprinting SMX on the surface of graphitic carbon nanostructures (CN) < 500 nm. The imprinted carbon nanostructures (ICN) were dispersed in plasticizer and entrapped in a PVC matrix that included (or not) a small amount of a lipophilic additive. The membrane composition was optimized on solid-contact electrodes, allowing near-Nernstian responses down to 5. 2 μg/mL and detecting 1. 6 μg/mL.

40|$|White-rot fungi (WRF) {{and their}} ligninolytic enzymes have been {{investigated}} {{for the removal of}} a broad spectrum of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) mostly from synthetic wastewater in lab-scale experiments. Only a few studies have reported the efficiency of such systems for the removal of TrOCs from real wastewater. Wastewater derived organic and inorganic compounds can inhibit: (i) WRF growth and their enzyme production capacity; (ii) enzymatic activity of ligninolytic enzymes; and (iii) catalytic efficiency of both WRF and enzymes. It is observed that essential metals such as Cu, Mn and Co at trace concertation (up to 1 mM) can improve the growth of WRF species, whereas non-essential metal such as Pb, Cd and Hg at 1 mM concentration can inhibit WRF growth and their enzyme production. In the case of purified enzymes, most of the tested metals at 1 - 5 mM concentration do not significantly inhibit the activity of laccases.

However, its broad antimicrobial activity and low cost, {{lead to an}} intensive use, which can seriously affect human health. Therefore, its spread in the food products has to be monitored. The scope of this work was to synthetize a sensitive and very selective molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for DXy detection in honey samples. Firstly, the synthesis of this biosensor was performed by casting a layer of carboxylate polyvinyl chloride (PVC-COOH) on the working surface of a gold screen-printed electrode (Au-SPE) in order to bind covalently the analyte under mild conditions. Secondly, DXy as a template molecule was bounded to the activated carboxylic groups, {{and the formation of}} MIP was performed by a biocompatible polymer by the mean of polyacrylamide matrix. Then, DXy was detected by measurements of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). A non-imprinted polymer (NIP) prepared in the same conditions and without the use of template molecule was also performed. We have noticed that the elaborated biosensor exhibits a high sensitivity and a linear behavior between the regenerated current and the logarithmic concentrations of DXy from 0. 1 pg. mL− 1 to 1000 pg. mL− 1.

A considerable amount of matrix was present after extraction of urine over C- 18 cartridges, resulting in significant ion suppression. With PDVB cartridges, the matrix was less prominent, and less ion suppression was observed, For single MS, a detection limit (LOD) of about 25 ng/mL was found with PDVB cartridges. With Cls cartridges an LOD of only about 50 ng/mL could be obtained. Applying tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) {{did not lead to}} an improved LOD due to an <b>interfering</b> <b>compound,</b> However, a considerable improvement in the LOD was obtained with MS 3. The selectivity and sensitivity were increased by the combination of efficient fragmentation of clenbuterol and reduction of the noise.

The ion suppression was 4 to 45 % (concentration range: 250 to 1. 0 ng/mL) after extraction of urine using PDVB cartridges, and up to 70 % ion suppression was observed using Cls cartridges. With MS 4, no further improvement in selectivity and sensitivity was achieved, due to inefficient fragmentation of clenbuterol and no further reduction of noise.

40|$|This thesis {{originates}} {{with the}} development and characterisation of polypyrrole (PPy), formed {{in the presence of}} a large protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA). The BSA was incorporated into the polymer film during electropolymerisation from an aqueous solution of pyrrole monomer, BSA and NaCl as a supporting electrolyte. The presence of the BSA within the polymer film was confirmed using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with electron dispersive X-Ray analysis (EDX). Optimum conditions for the growth of the polypyrrole-bovine serum albumin film (PPy-BSA) were obtained by varying the concentration of the monomer and BSA, the applied potential and the polymerisation charge. Highly adherent polymers were formed at 0. 70 V vs. SCE in a 0. 10 mol dm- 3 NaCl supporting electrolyte with high concentrations of pyrrole (0. 5 mol dm- 3) and low concentrations of BSA (< 200 μL). The presence of the BSA within the polymer film greatly reduced the electroactivity of the film. The urease enzyme was also immobilised in the polypyrrole film. The modified polypyrrole film was formed at 0. 70 V vs. SCE from an aqueous solution of pyrrole and urease (4000 mg dm- 3) in the presence of 0. 10 mol dm- 3 NaCl as a supporting electrolyte. The presence of urease within the polypyrrole-urease (PPy-Urs-Cl) film was confirmed using SEM and EDX and the PPy-Urs-Cl was then investigated as a sensing material for urea. The PPy-Urs-Cl film exhibited a reasonable sensitivity towards urea of 5. 41 μC μM- 1 in the 1. 0 x 10 - 5 to 1. 0 x 10 - 3 mol dm- 3 urea concentration range. Sulphonated-β-cyclodextrin (SCD) was then incorporated into the polymer to give a PPy-Urs-SCD film. This PPy-Urs-SCD polymer film was investigated as a sensing material for urea in a phosphate buffer solution. It was found that the SCD dopant greatly enhanced the detection of urea, with detection of urea in the 1. 0 x 10 - 10 mol dm- 3 region and a sensitivity of 46. 09 μC μM- 1. A wide variety of interfering compounds was examined to establish their effect, if any, on the detection of urea using the modified PPy-Urs-SCD. The interference from the common biological <b>interfering</b> <b>compound,</b> ascorbic acid, was effectively blocked and no interference was observed in the presence of common salts, such as ammonium chloride. Interference was observed in the presence of uric acid, hydroxyurea, thiourea and creatinine. The urease enzyme and the SCD are large, giving rise to porous PPy-Urs-SCD films and this allows access of the interfering compounds to the electrode surface. However, this interference was reduced by depositing a layer of the more compact PPy-Urs-Cl followed by the PPy-Urs-SCD film. A detailed investigation into the host-guest complexation properties of SCD with urea, and the interfering compounds, was performed using cyclic voltammetry. Clear evidence for complexation between SCD as the host molecule and urea as the guest molecule was obtained, which accounts for the high sensitivity in the detection of urea. No inclusion complex was formed between urea and the α-SCD or between SCD and the interfering compounds...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis finds its origin in {{the need to develop}} ad hoc and novel analytical strategies to screen efficiently targeted pesticide residues in the sector of food control. Our work intended not only to monitor an increased number of pesticides but also to elaborate a new frame based on Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry (IMS-MS) for a confident and reliable use of screening pesticide data. The main part of this thesis was devoted to an investigation of using ion mobility, hyphenated to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-IMS-MS), as a new dimension of separation for small polar organic molecules in complex biological samples without involving exhaustive sample preparation. The first objective of this study was dedicated to the development and optimization of UHPLC-IMS-MS using traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS). We have identified nitrogen as suitable gas for the mobility separation of multi-class pesticides and optimized the different T-wave parameters {{for a wide range of}} molecular weight pesticides. We observed for 100 pesticides tested that drift times gave a higher level of selectivity to the overall method as no <b>interfering</b> <b>compound</b> resulted at same retention time, drift time and measured mass from matrix blank samples. In addition, once the pesticide has been identified using its retention time, exact mass and drift time, the resulting cleaned mass spectrum facilitates the chemical structure elucidation. Key findings from this research show that drift times measurements are reproducible and independent from matrices tested and compound concentration leading to the proposition of using this parameter as a new identification point (IP). We have demonstrated that drift times can be used as an additional IP to increase confidence in the results without extending the analysis time or changing the sample preparation procedure. Based on reproducible data, we were the first group to report and recommend a 2 % variation of drift times as quality criteria for identification purposes. In a few recent published papers, we noticed that research groups developing similar analytical strategies have extensively adopted the 2 % proposed criterion. Obviously drift times are dependent of instrumental conditions. Hence, to apply the proposed approach with automated and wide scale screening methods further developments in processing software have been made which also allowed to convert drift times in calculated Collisional Cross Section (CCS) values by means of TWIMS calibration. The second aim of this thesis was dedicated to a comprehensive study of the reliability of CCS values derived from drift times for pesticides screening over a long period of time (3 years) with different ion mobility parameters. The results proved that CCS values are very consistent, as the measured values do not differ more than 1 % from the in-house reference data library. Different calibration mixtures were also tested and results show that the type of the compound used for calibration does not influence CCS measurement. However, the results emphasized the importance of the first low m/z mobility calibration point (i. e. below 200 m/z) to guarantee full independence from instrument parameters and calibrant. The robustness of the CCS calibration was then tested by changing deliberately the IMS parameters and compare the measured CCSs with the reference CCSs. Three set of experiments were done by changing the IM velocity (static mode = fixed value and dynamic mode = velocity ramping) and also IM gas pressure. The first set of parameters gave CCS values within 2 % error from the reference CCS throughout the pesticides mass range, while for the last 2 sets of parameters, deviations beyond 2 % error away from the reference CCSs are clearly marked under the m/z 232 (first CCS calibration point). From these results, we clearly see that CCS values generated with the same calibration protocol are reproducible even for target masses under the first CCS calibration point, whereas robustness is guaranteed within the strict limits of the calibration range. To extend the calibration range to a larger window of molecular weights (in the lower and upper range) a combination of acetaminophene-polyalanine and a mixture of small molecules containing also polyalanine were tested. No significant deviations were observed between the two new calibration mixtures as all the pesticide results were within the 2 % error. This observation demonstrates that the nature of the reference compounds used for calibration does not influence the outcome of the estimated CCS values for low molecular weight pesticides. Finally, an intercomparison study was designed to evaluate the relative capabilities of producing CCS values with a simple protocol for screening purposes. Four laboratories in three different countries (UK, USA and Belgium) were involved in the test. For this comparison, only monoisotopic ions were selected and 6 out of 40 pesticides selected had their masses under the first CCS calibration point (m/z 232). When comparing the percentage errors of each laboratory values to the calculated consensus value (mean of the CCS from the 4 instruments), two laboratories presented a few values outside the 2 % error limits. Interestingly, when each laboratory used their in house reference CCS to calculate the percentage errors for a spiked mandarin extract, the results are well within the 2 % CCS error window. These observations highlighted that the direct use of CCS values reported from the literature has to be treated with great care when applying the proposed approach. After this extensive study on CCS values, the third goal was to assess the possible added value of using CCS criterion when performing a UHPLC-IM-(HR) MS screening method of targeted pesticides. The approach has been tested in the framework of a proficiency test (EURL-PT-FV- 16). The PT material was a sweet pepper homogenate containing 13 pesticides measured by LC in positive mode. Two additional pesticides can be added to this list, primicarb-desmethyl and tebuconazole, because they were in the sample but were not evaluated in the PT results by the organizers since their concentrations were below the minimum required reported limit of 0. 01 mg kg- 1. In total, we were expecting 15 detections by using our screening method. The approach proposed here is unconventional for screening and consists on one hand (scenario A), on large mass accuracy (20 ppm), large retention time window (0. 5 min) and large CCS error (10 %) in order to capture, in a first step, a maximum of detected compounds. 26 tentative candidates were then identified. In this scenario, when closing down first the mass accuracy window from 20 ppm to 5 ppm, 8 candidates were discarded. However, a wrong decision has been taken for two of them, (2 false negatives), requiring to trigger additional investigations. In the second step of scenario A, by selecting the 2 % error for CCS, five additional residues did not meet the criterion and were ruling out, giving in total 13 detected compounds, actually present in the PT sample and 2 questionable data. In scenario B, when we directly apply a narrower CCS error percentage (from 10 to 2 %) without filtering on mass accuracy we gain directly all the 15 compounds present in the PT sample without any false negatives and discard the 11 false positives in one step. These findings are indeed promising and require obviously confirmation at large scale within the pesticide laboratory end-users network equipped with IMS-MS and willing to apply the proposed screening strategy. Interlaboratory studies and PTs within the pesticide community are required to consolidate our findings during this thesis work. Regarding the treatment of data and software, considerable improvements have been made in terms of automatic extraction of mobility data and having a fully automated approach incorporating CCS values as a screening parameter has never been tested before this thesis. Nonetheless, there is room for improvements in terms of downsizing the acquisition file size which should enable faster processing and reporting time along with easier data storage. While the results from this thesis demonstrated that nitrogen was the most suited gas, Howdle et al. (1) have reported that the use of binary gas mixtures results in excellent selectivity enhancements over single gas composition for IMS separations and most importantly they demonstrated that this selectivity can be tuned by altering the binary gas composition. One can only barely imagine the impact of such results for IMS applications. Being able to choose the best gas mixture and/or develop gradient with variable gas composition during the mobility separation would most probably achieve better mobility resolution customized for specific applications or to create new opportunities for multi-class screening (e. g. pesticides, mycotoxins, food contact materials, food additives…). This new approach will trigger new research in the field of instrumental development to ensure control over the composition of gas delivered in the IMS cell and also how to adapt or create TWIMS calibration for these significant changes. The application space for ion mobility is vast, not only as a means of the specific pioneering application we developed here but in the richness of these measurements can provide in structural information of ions in many research fields including fundamental research. Conceptualization, design and construction of contemporary instruments were growing fast over the past few years. Emerging IM strategies developed by manufacturers based on proof-of-concept published papers encompass Overtone Mobility Spectrometry (OMS); confinement and mobility selective release like Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry (TIMS), or Cyclic Drift Tube Ion Mobility Spectrometry (Cyclic DTIMS) and more recently Cyclic Traveling Wave Ion Mobility Spectrometry (Cyclic TWIMS). For example, in Cyclic TWIMS, one remarkable feature is the use of one meter single path transit ring which was placed orthogonally to the primary beam travelling wave path of the instrument. This novel multi-pass cyclic device gives access to higher resolving power. As the Resolution (CCS/CCS) in T-wave increases in proportion to the square root of the device length, the one meter single pass in the ring being 4 times the length of a standard Synapt G 2 -S, the Resolution is doubled by cycle. Giles et al. reported up to 6 passes showing an acceptable ion transmission with a signal drop of only 15 % (2). These emerging high-resolution IMS instruments clearly open new possibilities of separation of structural isomers low molecular weight compounds. Based on this research project, we are convinced that ion mobility used as an additional dimension of separation in hyphenated techniques can play a role in addressing the needs to provide reliable screening data and helping to reduce the rate of false negative and positive results prior to confirmation by quantitative methods. IMS-MS has become a key technology to answer chemical food safety issues as demonstrated by the rapidly expanding literature using IMS-MS over recent years. In a broader view, the concept of CCS data used as an additional identification tool and the development of new CCS databases will contribute to strengthen the needs in gathering reliable information to help the analyst in making right decision in the field of the very challenging qualitative screening analysis of trace chemical residues in food...|$|E

This investigation establishes appropriate conditions for using lifetime measurements to reduce the impact of compound interference effects during large-scale HTS of corporate screening files. Experimental data on mixtures of standard fluorophores and <b>interfering</b> <b>compounds</b> (from 5 HTS campaigns) have been combined with a theoretical model to identify the minimum data quality required, defined by the photon count in the peak channel, for discrimination of biological activity. Single-component fluorophore lifetimes can be recovered with an error of 1 %, with a peak photon count of 102, but the same accuracy with a 2 -component decay requires a peak photon count of 103. When a 3 rd component is introduced, the minimum peak count increases to 104. The influence of scattered light on lifetime determination was investigated using an emulsion (diameters 25 - 675 nm).

Matrices analyzed included fish fillet, fish feed, fish oil and linseed oil. Combining optimized saponification and solid-phase extraction led to high efficiency in the elimination of <b>interfering</b> <b>compounds,</b> mainly fat, from the extracts. The developed procedure minimized {{the presence of these}} <b>interfering</b> <b>compounds</b> in the extracts and provided satisfactory recoveries of PAHs.

Confirmation of positive findings was performed by GC coupled to high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOFMS). The accurate mass information provided by GC/TOFMS in full acquisition mode together with its high mass resolution makes it a powerful analytical tool for the unequivocal confirmation of PAHs in the matrices tested.

40|$|Starch {{consists}} of the two glucose polymers, amylose and amylopectin, and is deposited as semicrystalline granules inside plastids. The starch granule proteome is particularly challenging to study due {{to the amount of}} <b>interfering</b> <b>compounds</b> (sugars, storage proteins), the very low starch granule-associated protein content and also the dynamic range of abundant proteins. Here we present the protocol for extraction and 2 -DE of wheat starch granule-associated proteins whose most important steps are: (i) washing and sonication to remove <b>interfering</b> <b>compounds</b> (storage proteins) {{from the surface of the}} granules, (ii) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations to monitor purification and granules swelling, (iii) appropriate protein extraction and solubilization to obtain enough proteins for Coomassie blue staining and proteomic analysis.

For quantitative proteomic analysis of proteins associated with wheat starch granules, we developed a two-step protein extraction protocol including TCA/acetone precipitation and phenol extraction. With this protocol, proteins were extracted from wheat starch granules and solubilized and satisfactory blue-stained 2 -DE protein maps were obtained.
