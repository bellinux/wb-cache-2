25|$|The {{dramatic}} {{performances were}} important to the Athenians – this is made clear by {{the creation of a}} tragedy competition and festival in the City Dionysia. This was organized possibly to foster loyalty among the tribes of Attica (recently created by Cleisthenes). The festival was created roughly around 508 BC. While no drama texts exist from the sixth century BC, we <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> names of three competitors besides Thespis: Choerilus, Pratinas, and Phrynichus. Each is credited with different innovations in the field.|$|E

Rich ladies swap their stones for paste imitations and drugs, later denying they knew of the {{substitution}} when they contact the police and their insurance companies. Scotland Yard have traced the work done on the jewels to a company called Golconda, and from there to Paul Varesco. Under the guise of picking up a wanted murderer, the police raided the club but were unable to find any jewels or dope secreted in the club or on anyone there, particularly Varesco.|$|E

25|$|An individual's FOK {{judgments}} {{are not necessarily}} accurate, and attributes of all three metamemory hypotheses are apparent in {{the factors that influence}} FOK judgments and their accuracy. For example, a person is more likely to give a higher FOK rating, indicating that they <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> answer, when presented with questions they feel they should know the answer to. This is in keeping with the cue familiarity hypothesis, as the familiarity of the question terms influences the individual's judgment. Partial retrieval also impacts FOK judgments, as proposed by the accessibility hypothesis. The accuracy of an FOK judgment is dependent upon the accuracy of the partial information which is retrieved. Consequently, accurate partial information leads to accurate FOK judgments, while inaccurate partial information leads to inaccurate FOK judgments. FOK {{judgments are}} also influenced by the number of memory traces linked to the cue. When a cue is linked to fewer memory traces, resulting in a low level of competition, a higher FOK rating is given, thus supporting the competition hypothesis.|$|E
500|$|Larry Carbone, a {{laboratory}} animal veterinarian, writes that, in his experience, IACUCs take their work very seriously {{regardless of the}} species involved, though the use of non-human primates always raises {{what he calls a}} [...] "red flag of special concern". A study published in Science magazine in July 2001 confirmed the low reliability of IACUC reviews of animal experiments. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the three-year study found that animal-use committees that do not know the specifics of the university and personnel do not make the same approval decisions as those made by animal-use committees that <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> university and personnel. Specifically, blinded committees more often ask for more information rather than approving studies.|$|E
500|$|Many {{contemporary}} {{film critics}} have written favorably about the film. It has been {{hailed as a}} masterpiece by Kent Jones, Adolf Heinzlmeier, Berndt Schulz and Penelope Gilliatt, who said it was [...] "not only a masterpiece of filmmaking, not only a great work of humanism in a perfect rococo frame, but also an act of historical testimony." [...] Its themes have been analyzed by film scholar and Renoir's biographer Leo Braudy, who observed that the film [...] "embodies a social world {{in which there are}} rules but no values. If you don't know the rules, you are crushed; but if you <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> rules you are cut off from your own nature." [...] Dudley Andrew described the film's [...] "complex social criticism" [...] while Kenneth Browser and Peter Cowie wrote about its sense of humanity. Other critics have written about the film's darker themes; Andrew Sarris praised its depiction of class differences. The complexity of Renoir's storytelling techniques have been examined by Roger Ebert, who called it [...] "so simple and so labyrinthine, so guileless and so angry, so innocent and so dangerous, that you can't simply watch it, you have to absorb it", Luc Sante, who called it [...] "a dense clockwork mechanism" [...] and Robin Wood, who said the film [...] "operates on all levels." [...] Critics have praised its farcical elements: Pauline Kael called it [...] "a great satirical comedy, a dance of death" [...] and Gerald Mast wrote [...] " [...] depicts the failure of love, the failure of society, and the failure of men to rise above the ridiculous. Their only success is that they try and they care." [...] David Thomson praised Renoir's performance and remarked on [...] "Renoir's admission that the director, supposedly the authoritative and manipulating figure, is as much victim as originator of circumstances." [...] Amy Taubin said [...] "I can think of no other film that is as unfailingly generousto its audience, its characters, its actors, the milieu and the medium." [...] J. Hoberman wrote about its influence on Woody Allen, Robert Altman and Mike Leigh.|$|E

[...] Filipino historian E. San Juan, Jr. argues that 1.4 million Filipinos died during the war and that constitutes an act of genocide {{on the part of the}} United States. E.
