5|$|Boisselier {{became the}} {{scientific}} director of Clonaid, an organization founded by Raël {{that sought to}} clone humans, in 1997. That year, Boisselier was interviewed by Le Monde about her role in Clonaid, and she lost her position with Air Liquide after the company learned of this. Air Liquide stated that her termination was due to her holding dual employment, {{and that she was}} strained by her Clonaid service. She filed a lawsuit against Air Liquide, arguing that she was the victim of religious discrimination. <b>Her</b> <b>suit</b> was successful: in 1999, she won a judgment of about US$30,000.|$|E
5|$|A month later, Samus awakens {{aboard a}} Galactic Federation starship, where she learns that Dark Samus's Phazon-based attacks have {{corrupted}} her. The Federation equips <b>her</b> <b>suit</b> with a Phazon Enhancement Device (PED) that enables her {{to harness the}} Phazon energy within herself. She is informed that her fellow bounty hunters, also corrupted with Phazon and equipped with PEDs, have gone missing during their missions to investigate several planets embedded with Leviathan Seeds. Samus is first sent to the planet Bryyo and later Elysia to determine {{what happened to her}} missing comrades. She soon discovers that both planets and their inhabitants are slowly being corrupted by the Leviathan Seeds; and that she must destroy the seeds to reverse this.|$|E
5|$|At school, Brinkley was {{introduced}} to the study of glandular extracts and their effects on the human system. He determined that this new field would help move his career forward. After two years of studies, and ever-deeper debts, Brinkley doubled his summer workload by taking two shifts at Western Union, but came home one day to find his wife and daughter gone. Sally filed for divorce and child support, but after two months of payments, Brinkley kidnapped his daughter and fled with her to Canada. Sally Brinkley, unable to obtain an extradition order from Canada, dismissed <b>her</b> <b>suit</b> for alimony and child support, allowing Brinkley to return to Chicago with the child. The couple reunited in their rocky marriage.|$|E

5|$|The {{heads-up display}} shows Samus's health, the supply mode for Reserve Tanks, icons that {{represent}} weapons, and a map display showing her location and its surroundings. The inventory screen allows the player to enable and disable weapons and abilities. While the beam weapon can be combined, the Spazer and Plasma beams {{cannot be used}} simultaneously. The backup units called Reserve Tanks can be used automatically when Samus's health is depleted. The game also features an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of the}} game. Additionally, the player can use the map computer found in each part of the planet to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, the player must find and use one of the save stations scattered around the planet. The game can also be saved at Samus's gunship, which fully recharges her health and ammunition as well. Super Metroid has three endings based on the time taken to complete the game, which determine whether Samus poses with or without <b>her</b> <b>suit.</b> The best ending is achieved when the game is completed under three hours.|$|E
25|$|Each {{complaint}} against her was dismissed or dropped, Van Voast stated in <b>her</b> <b>suit,</b> because New York State Supreme Court has ruled {{more than two}} decades ago that baring one's chest in public —for noncommercial activity— is as perfectly legal for a woman as it is for a man.|$|E

25|$|In May 2014, former acting Superintendent, Daphne Snook, {{filed suit}} against the school board and the district's {{solicitor}} for $75,000 in damages regarding her suspension during a criminal investigation. The investigation involved her using the district's email system to read school board member emails on personnel issues. The emails were focused on the hiring of a new superintendent. Snook intended to apply for that position. The investigation concluded with the county district attorney filing no criminal charges. In <b>her</b> <b>suit,</b> Snook admitted to reading the private communications between the board members.|$|E
25|$|The alleged perpetrator's father, who {{is alleged}} to have {{assisted}} him, hailed from a wealthy family in Tarsus and was at one time a jeweller. However, he had since gone bankrupt and started to work with his son, who is 26, as a minibus driver. He had previous records of smuggling. The alleged perpetrator's wife (married to him five years prior to the murder) claimed that he had continuously inflicted violence on her, and that he had forced her to withdraw <b>her</b> <b>suit</b> for divorce a few months before the incident as he allegedly had threatened to kill her and their son.|$|E

25|$|On returning, Polly Berry (also {{known as}} Polly Wash after her {{previous}} master) sued for her {{freedom in the}} Circuit Court in the case known as Polly Wash v. Joseph A. Magehan in October 1839. When <b>her</b> <b>suit</b> was finally heard in 1843, her attorney Harris Sproat was able to convince a jury of her free birth and kidnapping as a child. Wash was freed. She remained in St. Louis to continue her separate effort to secure her daughter Lucy Ann Berry's freedom, for which she had filed suit in 1842, shortly after Berry fled her master.|$|E
25|$|Francis filed <b>her</b> <b>suit</b> late in 2013, {{following}} {{the rejection of}} her claim by the city and a finding by the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing {{that she had a}} right to sue. She alleges that after finding that the DNA from the bite belonged to a woman, the LAPD detective supervising her verbally steered her away from Lazarus as a suspect, without naming her. When Nuttall called her and told her the Van Nuys detectives were working the cold case and had identified Lazarus as a suspect, she did not share what her supervisor had told her for fear of retaliation.|$|E
25|$|Women are not {{necessarily}} sympathetic to female complainants who have been sexually harassed. If the harasser was male, internalized sexism (or jealousy over the sexual attention towards the victim) may encourage some women to react with as much hostility towards the complainant as some male colleagues. Fear of being targeted for harassment or retaliation themselves may also cause some women to respond with hostility. For example, when Lois Jenson filed her lawsuit against Eveleth Taconite Co., the women shunned her both at work and in the community—many of these women later joined <b>her</b> <b>suit.</b> Women may even project hostility onto the victim in order to bond with their male coworkers and build trust.|$|E

Reid believed that every woman should feel just as glamorous in a swimsuit as she did in an evening gown, and she designed <b>her</b> <b>suits</b> accordingly.|$|R

25|$|The {{first freedom}} suit in St. Louis was filed in 1805 by Marguerite Scypion, an African-Natchez woman. Briefly, she filed based on {{maternal}} descent from her Natchez grandmother. As the Spanish had ended Indian slavery in 1769, Scypion held that her mother, Marie-Jean Scypion, {{should have been}} freed at the time based on her Natchez ancestry, and that Marguerite herself was illegally held as a slave from birth. Having had an earlier ruling in her favor overturned on appeal, in 1826 Marguerite Scypion renewed <b>her</b> <b>suit</b> for freedom, filing against her current master Jean Pierre Chouteau, who headed {{one of the most}} prominent fur trading families in the city. She gained freedom for herself and all her mother's descendants in 1836, in a decision upheld by the US Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|The two men briefly reunited in October 1951 to {{face charges}} {{that they had}} plagiarized Sunset Boulevard. Former Paramount {{accountant}} Stephanie Joan Carlson alleged that in 1947 she had submitted to Wilder and Brackett, at their request, manuscripts of stories, both fictional and based on fact, she had written about studio life. She claimed that one in particular, Past Performance, served {{as the basis for}} the Sunset script, and sued the screenwriters and Paramount for $100,000 in general damages, $250,000 in punitive damages, $700,000 based on the box office returns, and an additional $350,000 for good measure, for a total of $1,400,000. Carlson's suit was dismissed after two and a half years. In 1954, a similar suit was filed by playwright Edra Buckler, who claimed material she had written had been the screenplay's source. <b>Her</b> <b>suit</b> was dismissed the following year.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, {{after years}} of living in poverty on the meager sum {{provided}} by Johnson and any money she could acquire through menial jobs, Jack brought Scott to court demanding $1,000 per month to support herself and her son, and a share of whatever interests Scott held in Scotty's Castle and the gold mine Jack still believed he had. The lawsuit failed because Scotty {{did not have any}} legal interests in mining or the castle, and certainly did not have the funds to pay her $1,000 per month. Jack then immediately turned <b>her</b> <b>suit</b> against Johnson himself, accusing him of manipulating her husband and hiding his finances so as to thwart her. Johnson, of course, had no legal obligation to pay Jack any money at all, nor to give her a share in any of his property, so Jack's lawsuit again failed. Johnson took pity on her, however, and raised the monthly amount he gave her to $75.|$|E
