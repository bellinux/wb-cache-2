Massively parallel computers offering {{orders of magnitude}} increase in performance are under development by all the major computer vendors. Many sites now have production facilities that include massively parallel hardware. Molecular modeling methodologies (both quantum and classical) are also advancing at a brisk pace. The transition of molecular modeling software to a massively parallel computing environment offers many exciting opportunities, such as the accurate treatment of larger, more complex molecular systems <b>in</b> <b>routine</b> <b>fashion,</b> and a viable, cost-effective route to study physical, biological, and chemical `grand challenge` problems that are impractical on traditional vector supercomputers. This will have a broad effect on all areas of basic chemical science at academic research institutions and chemical, petroleum, and pharmaceutical industries in the United States, as well as chemical waste and environmental remediation processes. But, this transition also poses significant challenges: architectural issues (SIMD, MIMD, local memory, global memory, etc.) remain poorly understood and software development tools (compilers, debuggers, performance monitors, etc.) are not well developed.
