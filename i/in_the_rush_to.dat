25|$|Nina Pedersen, {{manager of}} Norwegian People's Aid (NPA)'s Civil Society Development Project is {{concerned}} that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> attract foreign investment for South Sudan not enough attention was paid {{as to whether the}} people negotiating the terms really knew the value of the land they were selling. According to the NPA, prior to South Sudan's declaration of Independence, beginning in 2007, private interests sought or secured 5.15 million hectares of land in the agriculture, biofuels, forestry, carbon credit, and ecotourism sectors—equivalent to more than eight percent of South Sudan’s total land area.|$|E
25|$|Remaining {{challenges}} However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> construct planning {{mistakes were}} made. Demand was overestimated, {{the construction of}} sewerage lagged behind the construction of treatment plants, designs were sometimes inappropriate, there was no requirement for pre-treatment of industrial effluents thus affecting the effectiveness of treatment processes, and the sites chosen for the first priority investments within a river basin were not always those where the highest impact could have been achieved in terms of improving river water quality. As a result, many plants are underutilized or poorly functioning. According to the Ministry of Construction, more than 50 wastewater treatment plants in more than 30 cities operated at only 30 percent of their capacity or did not even come into operation. Consequently, {{the impact of the}} investment program on the water quality in rivers and coastal waters has been limited.|$|E

25|$|On September 13, the Athenians left camp {{leaving their}} wounded behind and their dead unburied. The survivors, {{including}} all the non-combatants, numbered 40,000, {{and some of the}} wounded crawled after them as far as they could go. As they marched they defeated a small Syracusan force guarding the river Anapus, but other Syracusan cavalry and light troops continually harassed them. Near the Erineus river, Demosthenes and Nicias became separated, and Demosthenes was attacked by the Syracusans and forced to surrender his 6,000 troops. The rest of the Syracusans followed Nicias to the Assinarus river, where Nicias's troops became disorganized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> find drinking water. Many Athenians were trampled to death and others were killed while fighting with fellow Athenians. On {{the other side of the}} river a Syracusan force was waiting, and the Athenians were almost completely massacred, by far the worst defeat of the entire expedition in terms of lives lost. Nicias personally surrendered to Gylippus, hoping the Spartan would remember his role in the peace treaty of 421. The few who escaped found refuge in Catana.|$|E
25|$|Coulthard, Berger and Alesi's {{cars had}} been damaged beyond {{immediate}} repair; {{all three were}} thus forced to race their teams' spare cars, vindicating Ferrari's customary Monaco practice of bringing an additional car for each driver.

Irvine's Jordan and Boullion's Sauber were repaired, and the other drivers stuck at the first corner were able to restart their cars, apart from Salo and Schiattarella: the former's Yamaha engine overheated in the jam, requiring {{him to take the}} restart from the pit-lane in the spare Tyrrell, and the latter's Simtek was damaged by marshals attempting to move it from the scene of the accident. The impoverished team lacked a spare car, so Schiattarella could not take any further part in the race, and Simtek's participation in the event was endedwithout either car completing a racing lapwhen Verstappen's car suffered a recurrence of its persistent gearbox problems and was pushed into the pit-lane {{as the rest of the}} field embarked upon the second formation lap.|$|E

25|$|At the Battle of Ilipa, {{large numbers}} of Celtiberian mercenaries in Carthaginian service confronted a mixed army of Romans and Iberians. Scipio Africanus Major {{employed}} a clever ruse. Every day for several days, he drew up his army for battle with the Romans stationed in {{the centre of the}} line and the Iberians on the wings. But when the enemy offered battle, he would eventually decline it. By this stratagem, he convinced the Carthaginian commanders Mago and Hasdrubal Gisco that they could expect the Romans to hold the centre of their line. On the day of the battle, the Roman force deployed earlier in the day and with the Romans posted on the wings of the line. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> respond, the Carthaginians placed their best forces in the centre as usual, failing to spot the unusual Roman deployment. Thus the inferior Carthaginian mercenaries on the wings were severely beaten by the Romans. The Celtiberians deserted the Carthaginian camp that night. This catastrophic defeat sealed the fate of the Carthaginian presence in Iberia. It was followed by the Roman capture of Gades in 206 BC after the city had already rebelled against Carthaginian rule. The Tribal leaders Indibilis and Mandonius (of the Ausetani) thought that, after the expulsion of the Carthaginians, the Romans would leave and they would gain control of Spain again. This didn't happen, however, so they participated with the mutineers at the Sucro camp against the Romans. This mutiny was ultimately squelched by Scipio Africanus.|$|E

500|$|The {{parliamentary}} debate {{was held on}} 8 April, {{one day after the}} 2010 general election had been announced, meaning it was during the so-called [...] "wash-up period" [...] when legislation is passed with little scrutiny. Only one hour was spent debating the ban and all three parties agreed, meaning no vote was required. In an interview conducted in July 2010, when he was no longer a minister, Johnson admitted the decision to ban mephedrone was sped up after widespread reporting of deaths caused by the drug, and because the government wished to pass the law before parliament was dissolved prior to the upcoming general election. In January 2011, however, Johnson told the Scunthorpe Telegraph that the decision was based only on information from the ACMD. An editorial in the April 2010 edition of The Lancet questioned the decision to ban mephedrone, saying the ACMD did not have enough evidence to judge the potential harms caused by mephedrone and arguing that policy makers should have sought to understand why young people took it and how they could be influenced to not take it. Evan Harris, then the Liberal Democrat science spokesman, stated the ACMD [...] "was not 'legally constituted'" [...] as required by the Misuse of Drugs Act, when the report on cathinones was published, since after Taylor resigned, it lacked a veterinary surgeon. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> make mephedrone illegal, the act that was passed specified the inactive enantiomer of mephedrone, leaving the active form legal until the loophole was closed in February 2011 by another act of parliament. In Chemistry World, John Mann, professor of chemistry at Queen's University Belfast, suggested the UK create a law similar to the Federal Analog Act of the United States, which would have made mephedrone illegal as an analog of cathinone. In August 2010, James Brokenshire, the Home Office drugs minister, announced plans to create a new category in the Misuse of Drugs Act, through the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill, that would allow new legal highs to be made temporarily illegal, without the need for a vote in parliament or advice from the ACMD, as was required to categorise mephedrone.|$|E
