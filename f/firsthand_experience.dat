It went into bankruptcy in 1990 and closed the following year. In 1992, McGovern's published reflections on the experience appeared in Wall Street Journal and the Nation's Restaurant News. He attributed part of the failure to the early 1990s recession, but also part to the cost of dealing with federal, state and local regulations that were passed with good intentions but made life difficult for small businesses, and to the cost of dealing with frivolous lawsuits. McGovern wrote, [...] "I... wish that during the years I was in public office I had had this <b>firsthand</b> <b>experience</b> about the difficulties business people face every day.

40|$|Due to {{increased}} removal from the agricultural industry, the non-farming publics? ability to gain <b>firsthand</b> <b>experiences</b> with agriculture may be limited.

Fairgoers, who attended the livestock exhibits at Rodeo Austin, San Diego County Fair, and State Fair of Texas, were asked to describe their response to engagement strategies used by fairs. Residents in Colorado, California, and Texas, were asked to describe to the their perceptions of fairs, the environment at fairs, and educational information being presented at fairs through a self completed questionnaire.
