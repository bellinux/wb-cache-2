40|$|This paper uses individual-level {{data from}} the Swedish 2011 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) to {{investigate}} differences with respect to individual characteristics associated with <b>independent</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> (nascent entrepreneurship and new business ownership) and entrepreneurial employees. Are there any differences with respect to gender, age, income and education associated with these different forms of entrepreneurship? Furthermore, {{it can be argued}} that an entrepreneurial employee differs with respect to attitudes and perceptions about entrepreneurship. Do attitudes and perceptions about entrepreneurship, for example, perceiving entrepreneurship as good career choice, or the fear of failure differ between entrepreneurial employees and <b>independent</b> <b>entrepreneurs?</b> Our empirical findings shows what differs between entrepreneurial employees and <b>independent</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> are their perceptions about opportunities and capabilities. Moreover, the probability of becoming an entrepreneurial employee increases with the level of education. Entrepreneurial employees; Global Entrepreneurship monitor; Swede...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the potential contribution of vertical marketing systems to the development of small business entrepreneurs and in particular to entrepreneurially disadvantaged groups. The following are the two major questions for this study: 1. Do vertical linkage systems serve as a pathway for the entrepreneurially disadvantaged groups, namely those with no entrepreneurial experience, from families without business background, and from indigenous ethnic groups? The modernization process in Third World countries, and in particular Indonesia, may create a widening gap between the modern and the traditional sectors. Vertical relationship systems with their unique characteristics (e. g. a symbiotic relationship between large and small business operation) may contribute towards reducing this gap through developing the entrepreneurially disadvantaged groups into business careers. 2. Do vertical relationships accomodatb, <b>independent</b> <b>entrepreneurs?</b> It is assumed that <b>independent</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> can perform better entrepreneurial functions than those "entrepreneurs" who are constrained by external power. There are doubts whether the vertical relationship, characterized by a large firm's dominant role, can accomodate <b>independent</b> <b>entrepreneurs.</b> This study reveals that despite many problems and limitations a tight-control type of vertical marketing system can serve as a pathway for individuals from entrepreneurially disadvantaged groups to become successful modern-type entrepreneurs. The performance of these disadvantaged groups is equal to that of other different groups. Also, <b>independent</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> exist in all the vertical marketing systems studied...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} notion that {{different}} types of entrepreneurs exist, distinguishable {{not only by the}} types of business activities undertaken, but also by certain personality traits they possess. Selected personality traits of franchised entrepreneurs are compared to those of <b>independent</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> using empirical data from 127 franchised owner-managers from ten restaurant franchises. The study findings suggest that, while high need for achievement motivates entrepreneurial endeavours of various types, the distinctive conditions of franchising mean that franchisees neither possess, nor require, such high degrees of internal locus of control and ambiguity tolerance as do <b>independent</b> <b>entrepreneurs...</b>|$|R

The product idea was first offered to Hanes, but was rejected. Scott Paper company pursued development, but ultimately decided to not market the product. Fruit of the Loom had been engaged as supplier of the blank underwear and another vendor engaged to apply transfers. Informed of Scott Paper Company's decision to not market this novel product, Fruit of the Loom inquired {{if they would be}} permitted to market the product, now fully developed. Weiss agreed, and in 1978 Fruit of the Loom bought Underoos. The product was tested in three markets including the New York Metropolitan area. Retailer and consumer demand was so strong, the product was immediately expanded to national distribution.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cause of}} the {{decrease}} in silver content were the probate disputes between Emperor Frederick III and the master of his mint in Graz, Balthasar Eggenberger. As an <b>independent</b> <b>entrepreneur,</b> Balthasar was doing business at his own risk and his profit margin {{was based on the}} ratio {{of the value of the}} actual silver content of the coins against their value as currency. When the emperor increased the fees for the minting lease or raised taxes to pay debts, merchants had to pass that cost on by increasing prices or, as in the mint master's case, decreasing the actual amount of silver in the coinage thereby lowering the production cost of the coins against their value as currency. According to Austrian chronicler and contemporary of Balthasar's: [...] "The emperor allowed bad coins to be minted; these coins were named Schinderlings. Anyone with lots of old copper kettles could mint better. He allowed such coins to be minted...by a citizen in Graz named Eggenberg, who had the lease on the minting operations in Graz and in St. Veit in Carinthia.|$|E

40|$|Under {{conditions}} of informational asymmetry, redistributing the property rights may improve work incentives but {{lead to an}} inefficient choice of entrepreneurial risk. We present a model in which reassignment of property rights does not affect factor prices and we show that there exist egalitarian asset redistributions that enhance allocative efficiency. The scope for such redistributions can be broadened by offering fair insurance protecting the <b>independent</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> against risk unassociated with the production process and against production uncertainties that are unrelated {{to the quality of}} their individual decisions. The market will generally supply insurance of this type suboptimally. ...|$|E
