Using a data set of individual labor disputes brought to French courts over the years 1996 to 2003, we examine the impact of labor court activity on labor market flows. First, we present a simple theoretical model showing the links between judicial costs and judicial case outcomes. Second, we exploit our model as well as the French institutional setting to generate instruments for these endogenous outcomes. In particular, we use shocks in the supply of lawyers who resettle close to their university of origin. Using these instruments, we show that labor court decisions have a causal effect on labor flows. More trials and more cases won by the workers cause more <b>job</b> <b>destructions.</b> More settlements, higher filing rates, and a larger fraction of workers represented by a lawyer dampen <b>job</b> <b>destructions.</b> Various robustness checks confirm these findings. labor judges, labor flows, employment protection legislation, unfair dismissal, France...|$|R

40|$|Measures of <b>job</b> {{creation}} and <b>destruction</b> are now produced regularly by the U. S. statistical agencies. The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases via the Business Employment Dynamics (BED) on a quarterly basis measures of <b>job</b> {{creation and}} <b>destruction</b> for the U. S. nonfarm business sector and related disaggregation by industrial sector and size class. The U. S. Census Bureau has developed the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) covering the nonfarm business sector {{that has been}} used to produce research analysis and special tabulations including tabulations of <b>job</b> creation and <b>destruction.</b> Both of these data programs build upon the measurement methods and data analysis of <b>job</b> creation and <b>destruction</b> measures from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) developed and published by Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996). In this paper, the LRD based estimates of <b>job</b> creation and <b>destruction</b> are updated and made available for consistent annual and quarterly series from 1972 - 1998. While the BED and LBD programs are more comprehensive in scope than the LRD, the extensive development of the LRD permits the construction of measures of <b>job</b> creation and <b>destruction</b> for a rich array of employer characteristics including industry, size, business age, ownership structure, location and wage structure.

50|$|Haltiwanger {{is known}} for his {{influential}} work using firm-level longitudinal data to explore the dynamics of job creation, <b>job</b> <b>destruction,</b> and economic performance. In his 1996 book Job Creation and Destruction (co-authored with Steven Davis and Scott Schuh), he uses plant-level data from the manufacturing industry to examine how businesses and workers respond to changes in their economic environments. Among the most striking findings in the book are the large and persistent gross job flows, which dwarf the net job flows that are commonly observed in employment data. Job Creation and Destruction laid the groundwork for subsequent research that not only confirmed the existence of such large gross job flows in other time periods, sectors, and countries, but also delved into the mechanisms and theories that would explain these flows.|$|E
50|$|Whether EPL has {{any effect}} on {{unemployment}} {{is an issue of}} contention between economists. On the one hand, assuming that the cyclical wage pattern is not affected by mandated firing costs, EPL reduces the propensity to hire by employers, since they fear that such decisions will be difficult to reverse in the future, in case of a recession. On the other hand, EPL also leads firms during downswings to keep more workers employed, than they would have otherwise done. Therefore, EPL reduces both job creation and <b>job</b> <b>destruction,</b> so that the net effects on average employment and unemployment are not identifiable a priori. What is instead agreed among economists, is that more stringent EPL lowers the fluctuations in the quantity of labour demanded over the business cycle, leading to smoother dynamic patterns of those aggregates.|$|E

We distinguish short-term from long-term contracts with high firing costs into a life cycle model of the labor market with endogenous job creations and <b>job</b> <b>destructions.</b> We show that high employment protection improves the employment rate of older workers but reduces the employment rate of the youngest. However, short term contracts with low protection do not allow to increase the employment of young workers. In turn, we find that it would better to consider only one type of contracts and set the firing cost at a value as much lower (higher) as the reform is designed to increase the employment rate of the younger (older) workers. employment, age , labor contracts, firing cost...|$|R

This study takes advantage of the possibility to follow employees for two years - thanks to the DADS database - and improves the measure of job flows by eliminating spurious flows related to plants identifier changes. Thus job flows are divided by two and appear to be by far less important in France than in the USA. The same database allows the study of the link between job flows and worker flows.
