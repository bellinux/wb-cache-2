40|$|It is {{generally}} acknowledged {{that in most}} circumstances, some special treatment of an asphalt surface is required to improve aircraft braking in wet conditions.

30|$|<b>Groove</b> filling was {{the first}} method {{proposed}} in the literature to produce a composite by FSP (Mishra et al. 2003). It is simple and requires less machining. A straight <b>groove</b> can be produced on the workpiece using ordinary milling cutter. Recently, Gandra et al. (2011) has studied {{the position of the}} <b>groove</b> with respect to the tool pin and demonstrated that if the <b>groove</b> is placed under the pin, the powder distribution is found to be more compared with placing the <b>groove</b> outside the pin interaction area (advancing or retrieving). Another strategy was proposed by Heydarian et al. (2014) in <b>groove</b> filling method in which parallel <b>grooves</b> with gradient <b>groove</b> depths were produced and FSP was carried out. Compared with single <b>groove,</b> composite produced from the gradient <b>grooves</b> was found to have uniform distribution of the powder. Whereas the <b>groove</b> filling and closing method needs additional tools such as pin-less FSP tool, and also the process involves two cycles; one to close the <b>groove,</b> and the second to produce the composite. The amount of secondary phase that can be introduced into the workpiece is more in <b>groove</b> filling and closing method compared with simple <b>groove</b> filling method because it prevents the escape of filled particles during FSP.|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that a twin <b>groove</b> {{arrangement}} {{will provide a}} more effective lubrication and a cooler operation than a single <b>groove</b> one, but little evidence {{has been found in}} support of this claim. Furthermore, there are no experimental works, to the authors’ knowledge, that compare the performance of single and twin axial <b>groove</b> bearings with the same geometry. An experimental assessment of a journal bearing with either two axial <b>grooves</b> located at +/- 90 º or just one single <b>groove</b> at + 90 º to the load line was performed. The comparison was made by using the same bearing for both <b>groove</b> configurations but the oil feeding to the - 90 º <b>groove</b> was shut with a valve in one of the cases in order to emulate a single <b>groove</b> bearing. Measurements of total and partial lubricant flow rate through each <b>groove,</b> shaft locus, inner bush surface temperature, oil outlet temperature and electrical motor consumption were performed. For the range of applied loads tested the twin <b>groove</b> journal bearing displayed a lower maximum temperature but a higher outlet temperature and eccentricity than the single <b>groove</b> journal bearing. Also the measured total flow rate in the bearing was approximately the same for the single and the twin <b>groove</b> arrangements. For the twin <b>groove</b> bearing, the partial flow rate through each <b>groove</b> varied dramatically with increasing load: At high eccentricities the flow being supplied to the active land of the bearing through the + 90 º <b>groove</b> was much lower than that supplied to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º <b>groove.</b> Actually, the measured flow rate at the + 90 º <b>groove</b> was almost zero for the highest load tested, with nearly all the lubricant being fed to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º <b>groove.</b> This means that under heavy load operation, the existence of an extra <b>groove</b> at - 90 º to the load line might actually deteriorate lubrication effectiveness when compared with a single <b>groove</b> arrangement...|$|R
40|$|A {{plate-fin}} {{heat exchanger}} {{is a type}} of heat exchanger widely used in air conditioners, and tubes and fins are tightly assembled by the mechanical expansion process of tubes.

In this study, the adhesion and heat transfer performance affected by the tube expansion of the non-uniform <b>groove</b> shape tube with different heights are investigated by both analysis and experiments. From the analysis method, it was shown that the contact pressure of non-uniform <b>groove</b> tube is higher than that of the uniform <b>groove</b> tube, and the most appropriate high <b>groove</b> number of the non-uniform <b>groove</b> tube is designed for the maximum contact pressure.
