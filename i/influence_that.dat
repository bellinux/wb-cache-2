5|$|According to {{a poetic}} verse {{composed}} by the contemporary Icelandic skald Óttarr svarti, Knútr's subjects included Danes, Englishmen, Irishmen, and Islesmen. These Islanders could refer {{to either the}} folk of the Isles or Orkney, whilst the Irish seems {{to refer to the}} Dubliners. The fact that Sitriuc had been able to undertake a pilgrimage and return home to an intact kingdom in 1028 may demonstrate the extent of <b>influence</b> <b>that</b> Knútr held over the Irish Sea region. This authority, and Sitriuc's apparent close connections with Knútr, could account for the security Sitriuc enjoyed during Knútr's reign.|$|E
5|$|After reigning two years, Amon {{was assassinated}} by his servants, who conspired against him, and was succeeded {{by his son}} Josiah, {{who at the time}} was eight years old. After Amon's {{assassination}} his murderers became unpopular with the people, and were ultimately killed. Some scholars, such as Abraham Malamat, assert that Amon was assassinated because people disliked the heavy <b>influence</b> <b>that</b> Assyria, an age-old enemy of Judah responsible for the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel, had upon him.|$|E

5|$|Southeast Asian musical {{innovations}} {{include those}} {{during a period}} of Indian <b>influence</b> <b>that</b> ended around 920 AD. Balinese and Javanese music made use of xylophones and metallophones, bronze versions of the former. The most prominent and important musical instrument of Southeast Asia was the gong. While the gong likely originated in the geographical area between Tibet and Burma, it was part of every category of human activity in maritime Southeast Asia including Java.|$|E

Willing to sacrifice himself for Stannis's sake, Cressen puts poison in a cup and asks Melisandre to drink from it after he has done so. While he dies almost immediately, the priestess swallows the entire cup unaffected.|$|E

The song attained a top-twenty peak position in Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|A {{pioneering}} {{work of the}} fantasy genre was The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Elves of Middle-earth {{played a central role}} in Tolkien's legendarium, notably The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing had such <b>influence</b> <b>that</b> in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons) are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions as well. They are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.|$|E
5|$|After the Báb was {{executed}} in 1850, {{a group of}} Tehran Bábís, headed by a Bábí known as Azim, who was previously a Shaykhi cleric, plotted an assassination plan against the Shah Nasser-al-Din Shah, {{in retaliation for the}} Báb's execution. Bahá'u'lláh condemned the plan; however, any moderating <b>influence</b> <b>that</b> he may have had was diminished in June 1851 when he went into exile to Baghdad at the chief minister's request, returning only after Amir Kabir's fall from power. On 15 August 1852, the radical group of Bábís attempted the assassination of the Shah and failed. The group of Bábís linked with the plan, were rounded up and executed, but notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire Bábí community was blamed, precipitating violent riots against the Bábí community that were encouraged and orchestrated by the government. During this time many Bábís were killed, and many more, including Bahá'u'lláh, were imprisoned in the Síyáh-Chál ("black pit"), an underground dungeon of Tehran.|$|E
5|$|After the LCL lost {{government}} in 1970, primarily {{owing to the}} electoral reform, Hall managed to be re-elected as leader.

When the Dunstan government again introduced a bill to introduce universal suffrage to the council, Hall gained the support of 7 out of 20 members in the Assembly, but only 2 of 16 LCL members in the Legislative Council supported the bill. Internally, there was much opposition to any electoral reform when the matter was debated at party conferences.|$|E

5|$|Although the Boleyn {{family still}} held {{important}} {{positions on the}} Privy Council, Anne had many enemies, including the Duke of Suffolk. Even her own uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, had come to resent her attitude to her power. The Boleyns preferred France over the Emperor as a potential ally, but the King's favour had swung towards the latter (partly because of Cromwell), damaging the family's influence. Also opposed to Anne were supporters of reconciliation with Princess Mary (among them the former supporters of Catherine), who had reached maturity. A second annulment was now a real possibility, although it is commonly {{believed that it was}} Cromwell's anti-Boleyn <b>influence</b> <b>that</b> led opponents to look for a way of having her executed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more <b>influence</b> <b>that</b> an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|Buenos Aires and Montevideo {{successfully}} resisted two British invasions. In 1806, a small British army led by William Carr Beresford seized Buenos Aires {{for a brief}} time; a Montevidean army led by Santiago de Liniers liberated the city. The following year, {{a larger}} army seized Montevideo, but was overwhelmed {{by the forces of}} Buenos Aires; the invaders capitulated and returned Montevideo to the viceroyalty. There was no aid from Spain during either invasion. Liniers organized criollo militias during the preparations for the second invasion, in spite of the prohibition against them. The Patricios Regiment, led by Cornelio Saavedra, was the biggest criollo army. These events gave criollos military power and political <b>influence</b> <b>that</b> they did not have before and, since the victory was achieved without any help from Spain, it boosted criollo confidence in their independent capabilities.|$|E

5|$|First, {{the waves}} of Norse {{colonisation}} of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Norse influence was strongest in the Northeastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English. However the centre of norsified English {{seems to have been}} in the Midlands around Lindsey, and after 920 CE when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, Norse features spread from there into English varieties that had not been in intense contact with Norse speakers. Some elements of Norse <b>influence</b> <b>that</b> persist in all English varieties today are the pronouns beginning with th- (they, them, their) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with h- (hie, him, hera).|$|E

Then she attended Boston Arts Academy, a performing arts high school, where she was in the music department. Among her high school activities was singing with a jazz group, but she anticipated pursuing political science and communications in college. In 2010, she appeared in the Faces music video that was shot in Norwood, Massachusetts for Louie Bello. Her first job after college was in a law office. At age 24, she decided to pursue a career in acting. In 2011, she moved to New York City and studied acting at the Susan Batson Studios where she met her manager Josh Taylor. Guerrero's life experience compels her to advocate for immigration reform and is an <b>influence</b> <b>that</b> she draws upon in her acting.|$|E
