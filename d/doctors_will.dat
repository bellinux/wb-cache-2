Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay <b>doctors</b> <b>will</b> come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{medical system}} {{is based on}} a {{fee-for-service}} model, in which doctors are paid on the basis of ordering individual tests and procedures, so that most <b>doctors</b> <b>will</b> not get paid when they do not recommend (or recommend against) a given treatment. This system creates incentives for doctors to recommend additional treatments, rather than exercising evidence-based restraint.|$|E

25|$|The {{campaign}} {{addresses the}} problem of patients receiving unnecessary health care, reasoning that this results in poor outcomes for the patient and could create significant waste in the United States healthcare system. To conduct the campaign, a coordinator from ABIM Foundation asks medical specialty professional organizations to make five recommendations for preventing overuse of a treatment in their field. Distributors then share this information with community groups nationwide, and the medical specialty societies disseminate it to their members. The intent is that patients and <b>doctors</b> <b>will</b> discuss the recommendations in these lists, believing that if patients and doctors {{communicate with each other}} more effectively when making health decisions patients will have better outcomes and the medical system itself will benefit.|$|E

25|$|Several {{measures}} {{serve as}} indicators of the long-term financial status of Medicare. These include total Medicare spending {{as a share of}} gross domestic product (GDP), the solvency of the Medicare HI trust fund, Medicare per-capita spending growth relative to inflation and per-capita GDP growth; general fund revenue as a share of total Medicare spending; and actuarial estimates of unfunded liability over the 75-year timeframe and the infinite horizon (netting expected premium/tax revenue against expected costs). The major issue in all these indicators is comparing any future projections against current law vs. what the actuaries expect to happen. For example, current law specifies that Part A payments to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities will be cut substantially after 2028 and that <b>doctors</b> <b>will</b> get no raises after 2025. The actuaries expect that the law will change to keep these events from happening.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{surgical}} trainees enter training {{after five}} years of medical school and two years of the Foundation Programme. During the two to three-year core training programme, <b>doctors</b> <b>will</b> sit the Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) examination. On award of the MRCS examination, surgeons may hold the title 'Mister' or 'Miss/Ms' rather than doctor. This is a tradition dating back hundreds of years in the United Kingdom. Trainees will then go onto Higher Surgical Training (HST), lasting a further five to six years. During this time they may choose to subspecialise. Before the end of HST, the examination of Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS) must be taken in general surgery plus the subspeciality. Upon completion of training, the surgeon will become a consultant surgeon and will be eligible for entry on the GMC Specialist Register and may work both in the NHS and independent sector as a consultant general surgeon. The implementation of the European Working Time Directive limited UK surgical residents to a 48-hour working week. The introduction of a sub-consultant grade to enable those who have recently received a UK Certificate of Completion of Training may be necessary.|$|E
500|$|Missoula has {{two primary}} health care facilities: St. Patrick Hospital and Health Sciences Center and Community Medical Center. St. Patrick's was founded in 1873 under the {{sponsorship}} of the Sisters of Providence. It is the only LevelII trauma center in the region, the largest medical facility in Western Montana, and has undergone three major expansions since the 1980s. The hospital has 195 acute-care beds, and admitted over 9,700 patients in 2003. The name was changed from [...] "St. Patrick Hospital" [...] to [...] "St. Patrick Hospital and Health Sciences Center" [...] in 2000 to reflect an increasing involvement with national medical research and education. The Community Medical Center and its adjacent medical facilities are located near Fort Missoula and {{is part of a}} modern complex that includes a nursing home, the Missoula Crippled Children's Center, and private offices. It was founded in 1922 as Thornton Hospital by <b>doctors</b> <b>Will</b> Thornton and Charles Thornton and has been at its current location since 1972. Although originally a locally owned, not-for profit hospital, it is now owned by a large corporation headquartered in Nashville, TN, and is a for-profit entity. [...] It is the only hospital in Western Montana with a separate Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. The center is partnered with Seattle Children's Hospital. The nearest LevelI trauma center to Missoula is Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, Washington.|$|E

40|$|In {{prenatal}} care (which simply means, “before birth”), your <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> track your overall health and baby’s health {{by talking to}} you, and with lab tests and a physical exam. These doctor’s visits are very important. One way the <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> measure your baby’s growth is through a measurement of your growing belly, called “symphysis-fundal height (SFH) measurement”. This is an inexpensive and easy screening tool for fetal growth (an important measure of fetal health). Your <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> also feel your belly for your baby’s position and fluid around your baby. If your doctor has any concerns about your baby’s growth, she will refer you to have an ultrasound and help you {{through the process of}} looking at those results.

2500|$|What {{makes the}} lives of {{transgender}} individuals in Jamaica different from those in other countries {{is the fact that}} Jamaican society has an exceptionally low tolerance for LGBTQ individuals, especially male-to-female transgender women, according to a case study done by the University of West Indies’ Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social Economic Studies. [...] The stigmas placed upon these individuals influence their perception of the world, and upon internalising these stigmas, the treatment process becomes more difficult. [...] The viewpoint arises that <b>doctors</b> <b>will</b> stigmatise patients or treat them badly because of the unconventionality of the treatment being carried out. [...] Ultimately, low tolerance leads patients to obtain less treatment overall.|$|E

2500|$|On 2 September 1914, Britain {{requested}} Japan to send {{a division}} of their navy into the Mediterranean theater of operations, in order {{to counter the threat}} posed by the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian navies as well as the German Mediterranean Division. Japan declined citing its involvement in the blockade of Tsingtao and the Pacific Ocean operations. On 4 November, Britain reiterated their proposal offering to support Japanese claims {{at the conclusion of the}} war. This proposal was refused after chief of national staff Shimamura Hayao voiced the opinion that the presence of a Japanese force at such a distance from the homeland would create a risk of an American invasion. The British persisted by approaching the Japanese naval attache in London in December 1914 and 13 January 1915, who promptly rebuffed them. Negotiations were resumed on 2 February 1916, whereupon it was agreed that Australia will sign the Anglo–Japanese Commercial Treaty, Japanese immigrants will be granted entry into Australia and New Zealand, while Japanese <b>doctors</b> <b>will</b> be allowed to practice in British colonies. The above concessions in tandem with the appointment of Terauchi Masatake (who advocated wider cooperation) to the post of Prime Minister of Japan, led to the creation of the 1st Special Squadron that was tasked with escorting troopships from Australia and New Zealand to the Aden Protectorate as well as patrol duties on the same route. Japanese assistance was extended on 10 February 1917, when it was decided that a 2nd Special Squadron was to be created.|$|E
