5|$|Even if a {{molecule}} does not form a permanent <b>dipole,</b> {{it can still}} be influenced by an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric <b>dipole</b> results.

5|$|The bulk of Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field, like Earth's, {{is generated}} by an internal dynamo supported by the circulation of a conducting fluid in its outer core. But whereas Earth's core is made of molten iron and nickel, Jupiter's is composed of metallic hydrogen. As with Earth's, Jupiter's magnetic field is mostly a <b>dipole,</b> with north and south magnetic poles {{at the ends of}} a single magnetic axis. However, on Jupiter the north pole of the <b>dipole</b> is located in the planet's northern hemisphere and the south pole of the <b>dipole</b> lies in its southern hemisphere, opposite to the Earth, whose north pole lies in the southern hemisphere and south pole lies in the northern hemisphere. Jupiter's field also has quadrupole, octupole and higher components, though they are less than one tenth as strong as the <b>dipole</b> component.|$|E
5|$|The <b>dipole</b> {{component}} of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14microteslas (0.14G). The <b>dipole</b> magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2T·m3 (14μT·R'N3, where R'N is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the <b>dipole</b> moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune {{may be the result}} of offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.|$|E
5|$|The {{direction}} {{and intensity of}} the <b>dipole</b> change over time. Over {{the last two centuries}} the <b>dipole</b> strength has been decreasing {{at a rate of about}} 6.3% per century.

5|$|The {{nature of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{is one of}} heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone {{up and down in}} the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the <b>dipole</b> field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a <b>dipole</b> field. The <b>dipole</b> component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} {{is traditionally}} {{divided into three}} parts: the inner, middle and outer magnetosphere. The inner magnetosphere is located at distances closer than 10RJ from the planet. The magnetic field within it remains approximately <b>dipole,</b> because contributions from the currents flowing in the magnetospheric equatorial plasma sheet are small. In the middle (between 10 and 40RJ) and outer (further than 40RJ) magnetospheres, the magnetic field is not a <b>dipole,</b> and is seriously disturbed by its interaction with the plasma sheet (see magnetodisk below).|$|E

40|$|The {{solvation}} of ions in dipolar lattice droplets {{has been}} studied using Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that for small <b>dipoles</b> the solvation behavior {{is similar to that}} expected from a dielectric model. For larger <b>dipoles,</b> large deviations from dielectric behavior are observed. For the larger <b>dipoles,</b> it is found that only the first layers solvate the ion and that the more-distant <b>dipoles</b> tend to reduce the solvation energy. The obtained results support the idea that there exist two regions in systems with large <b>dipoles.</b> In the region closest to the ion, the ordering of the <b>dipoles</b> is determined by the ion, and further away from the ion, a dipolar regime exists. Between these two regions, there is an interface region that is likely to be important to our. understanding of the Hofmeister effect...|$|R

5|$|The Indian Ocean <b>Dipole</b> is an atmospheric–oceanic {{phenomenon}} {{characterized by}} differences in sea surface temperatures between {{the eastern and}} western sections of the tropical Indian Ocean. Similar to the Antarctic Oscillation, the Indian Ocean <b>Dipole</b> is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. In the positive phase, the eastern section of the tropical Indian Ocean is cooler (lower sea surface temperature) and the western section is warmer than normal (higher sea surface temperature). On the other hand, the negative phase is characterized by warmer sea surface temperatures on the eastern section and cooler sea surface temperatures on the western section of the tropical Indian Ocean. Studies {{have shown that the}} Indian Ocean <b>Dipole</b> is partly responsible for variations in precipitation in Argentina and South America in general. During a positive phase, precipitation is higher in the Río de la Plata Basin due to teleconnections.|$|E
5|$|The <b>dipole</b> is tilted roughly 10° from Jupiter's axis of rotation; {{the tilt}} {{is similar to}} that of the Earth (11.3°). Its {{equatorial}} field strength is about 776.6μT (7.766G), which corresponds to a <b>dipole</b> magnetic moment of about 2.83 T·m3. This makes Jupiter's magnetic field about 20 times stronger than Earth's, and its magnetic moment ~20,000times larger. Jupiter's magnetic field rotates at the same speed as the region below its atmosphere, with a period of 9h55m. No changes in its strength or structure have been observed since the first measurements were taken by the Pioneer spacecraft in the mid-1970s.|$|E

40|$|We give a {{derivation}} for {{the indirect}} interaction between two magnetic <b>dipoles</b> {{induced by the}} quantized electromagnetic field. It {{turns out that the}} interaction between permanent <b>dipoles</b> directly returns to the classical form; the interaction between transition <b>dipoles</b> does not directly return to the classical result, yet returns in the short-distance limit. In a finite volume, the field modes are highly discrete, and both the permanent and transition dipole-dipole interactions are changed. For transition <b>dipoles,</b> the changing mechanism is similar with the Purcell effect, since only a few number of nearly resonant modes take effect in the interaction mediation; for permanent <b>dipoles,</b> the correction comes from the boundary effect: if the <b>dipoles</b> are placed close to the boundary, the influence is strong, otherwise, their interaction does not change too much from the free space case.

5|$|Near {{the surface}} of the Earth, its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic <b>dipole</b> positioned {{at the center of the}} Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The <b>dipole</b> is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995–2000 (G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29) and {{discovered}} that Ganymede has a permanent (intrinsic) magnetic moment independent of the Jovian magnetic field. The value of the moment is about , which is three {{times larger than the}} magnetic moment of Mercury. The magnetic <b>dipole</b> is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176°, which means that it is directed against the Jovian magnetic moment. Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The <b>dipole</b> magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 ± 2 nT at Ganymede's equator, which should be compared with the Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede—about 120 nT. The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator—1440 nT.|$|E

40|$|We use an {{extended}} version of electrodynamics, which admits {{the existence of}} magnetic charges and currents, to discuss how different models for electric and magnetic <b>dipoles</b> do or do not carry hidden momentum {{under the influence of}} external electromagnetic fields. Based on that, we discuss how the models adopted for the electric and magnetic <b>dipoles</b> from the particles that compose a material medium influence the expression for the electromagnetic part of the light momentum in the medium. We show that Abraham expression is compatible with electric <b>dipoles</b> formed by electric charges and magnetic <b>dipoles</b> formed by magnetic charges, while Minkowski expression is compatible with electric <b>dipoles</b> formed by magnetic currents and magnetic <b>dipoles</b> formed by electric currents. The expression ε_ 0 E×B, on the other hand, is shown to be compatible with electric <b>dipoles</b> formed by electric charges and magnetic <b>dipoles</b> formed by electric currents, which are much more natural models. So this expression has an interesting interpretation in the Abraham-Minkowski debate about the momentum of light in a medium: It is the expression compatible with the nonexistence of magnetic charges. We also provide a simple justification of why Abraham and Minkowski momenta can be associated with the kinetic and canonical momentum of light, respectively.
