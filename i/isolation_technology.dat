40|$|Mobile device antenna {{design and}} <b>isolation</b> <b>technologies</b> are {{thoroughly}} investigated in this thesis. The antenna design parameters for mobile devices are quantified using practical restraints by analyzing almost 60 mobile handsets {{and the effect}} of materials, human tissue, manufacturing, and antenna type/placement on antenna design and then mapped into Wheeler-space that correlates the spherical wave modes with the antenna performance. The <b>isolation</b> <b>technologies</b> with mutual coupling anti-resonances are unified by a single performance parameter to distinguish them from the more traditional <b>isolation</b> <b>technologies.</b> This unifying performance parameter is the group delay between two antennas where high group delay indicates the presence of a bandstop filter in the form of either a PCB or an antenna modification. This thesis analyzes both PCB and antenna modifications with high group-delay and demonstrates these types of antennas can be placed in close proximity without affecting other performance parameters. It is also shown that both the PCB and antenna modifications contain two isolation methods where each isolation method is a mirror complement of the other method. Some antenna geometries can also increase the mutual coupling in order to improve the antenna performance using a phenomena called over-coupling. These over-coupled antenna systems can result in lower SAR for the cellular antennas and decreased array sizes for NFC/RFID/wireless-power antennas, resulting in better performance of antennas inside mobile devices. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of deep {{reactive ion etching}} (DRIE) technology has greatly expanded the accessible design space for microscopic systems. Structures that are hundreds of micrometers tall with aspect ratios of 40 : 1, heretofore impossible, can now be achieved.

40|$|A trench <b>isolation</b> <b>technology</b> employs {{trenches}} refilled with {{dielectric material}} to create, {{in a single}} layer, electrical isolation between mechanically joined components. This paper explores further use of this technology for MEMS fabrication, particularly the fabrication of electrostatic microactuators.

The isolation structures can be employed as flexible or rigid connections between movable or fixed components or can serve to prevent the short-circuiting by maintaining the end distance between movable electrodes. The isolation bumps reduce stiction during release and operation, prevent short-circuiting due to an out-of-plane displacement and can serve as etch holes at the same time.

The importance of CTCs as prognostic biomarker is leveraged when multiple studies found that patient with cutoff of 5 CTCs per 7. 5 [*]mL blood has poor survival rate. Despite its clinical relevance, the isolation and characterization of CTCs can be quite challenging due to their large morphological variability and the rare presence of CTCs within the blood. Numerous methods have been employed and discussed in the literature for CTCs separation.
