40|$|Numerical {{methods of}} {{analysis}} such as the finite element method and finite difference method have seen increasing use {{in recent years as}} tools for geomechanical mine design to predict problems of ground caving and failure. As a result of recent advances in computer technology, it is now possible to handle large-scale problems involving complex material and geometric nonlinearities at an affordable computational cost. The scope of this study is the stability of underground mine haulage drifts associated with sublevel stoping method with delayed backfill. This {{is one of the most}} popular mining methods today in Canadian underground metal mines. In this method, blasted ore is mucked with load-haul-dump vehicles and transported to the nearest dump through a nearby <b>haulage</b> <b>drift.</b> Therefore, it is crucial in a mining operation that a <b>haulage</b> <b>drift</b> remains functional during the life of the stope. This study is focused on studying the interaction between the <b>haulage</b> <b>drift</b> and nearby mining activity. The stability of the <b>haulage</b> <b>drift</b> is examined through a detailed parametric study of a finite element model representing typical mining layout most commonly adopted in Canadian underground metal mines. The model parametric study examines the influence of critical factors such as the stope mining sequences, mining depth and the distance between the stope and the <b>haulage</b> <b>drift.</b> The model is set up for nonlinear behaviour of the rock mass taking into account elastoplasticity of the rock mass and non-associated plasticity using Mohr Coulomb and Drucker Prager yield functions. Stability indicators are defined in terms of displacement, stress and the extent of yield zones. These indicators serve as a basis for assessing the effect of different parameters on the stability of the <b>haulage</b> <b>drift.</b> From the model parametric study, it is found that stope mining causes a lateral movement of the entire drift. The severity of such movement is increased with shorter distance between the stope and <b>haulage</b> <b>drift.</b> Of all mining sequences examined, same-level mining is the most critical step. It is also found that more yield zones develop around the <b>haulage</b> <b>drift</b> as the mining depth increases and as distance between <b>haulage</b> <b>drift</b> and the stope decreases. A 3 -centre arc drift is compared with a rectangular one of the same cross sectional area. It is found that the 3 -centre arc drift shape is more stable. This study also demonstrates that the nonlinear elastoplastic analysis gives more realistic results than traditional linear elastic analysis in terms of stress and displacement behaviour of the <b>haulage</b> <b>drift...</b>|$|E

Hence, their stability is crucial in underground mines. Drift instability could lead to serious consequences such as injuries, production delays and higher operational cost. This paper examines the issue of <b>haulage</b> <b>drift</b> safety, and probabilistic methods are used to assess drift unsatisfactory performance. Criteria used to define drift unsatisfactory conditions are: extent of yielding, and brittle shear failure. The Monteâ€“Carlo Simulation (MCS) technique is used in conjunction with finite difference modelling software FLAC for random assignment of model input parameters in the FLAC grid. Comparison between these different unsatisfactory conditions is carried out to determine the most critical unsatisfactory performance for the mine <b>haulage</b> <b>drift...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} {{component of}} underground mining costs stems from ground {{support in the}} form of rock bolts, mesh and screen, cable bolts, and shotcrete. Should any of this support approach or reach failure (stripped or broken cable bolts, severe bagging of screen, large numbers of broken rock bolts, etc.) then the support needs to be rehabilitated. This rehabilitation is often much more expensive than the initial support installation, due not just to the cost of the support, but to loss of access, down-time of that area of the mine, potential for injuries, and possible lost mining revenues. Many mines use instrumentation in critical infrastructure, such as <b>haulage</b> <b>drifts,</b> crusher stations, intersections, etc., to monitor the displacement of the backs and/or walls, support loads, etc. Data is generally collected by hand from time-to-time and entered into a database, but is analysed only if there is a problem (i. e. reactive engineering). Most mines today also utilize numerical modeling. These models, normally linear-elastic, are often not up to date and modeling is often done only in reaction to a problem. In certain cases modeling of the underground mining environment requires software packages that employ non-linear constitutive models (i. e. models that allow for failure to occur). Linear elastic models unrealistically allow for stresses to build up far beyond those at failure and hence do not redistribute stresses away from failed zones. The challenge with non-linear models is that they require the input o...|$|R
