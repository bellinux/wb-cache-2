40|$|A {{key element}} in the {{rational}} design of hybrid organic-inorganic nanostructures, is control of surfactant packing and adsorption onto the inorganic phase in crystal growth and assembly. In layered single crystal nanofibers and bilayered 2 D nanosheets of vanadium oxide, we show how the chemisorption of preferred densities of surfactant molecules can direct formation of ordered, curved layers. The atom-scale features of the structures are described using molecular dynamics simulations that quantify surfactant packing effects and confirm the preference for a density of 5 dodecanethiol molecules per 8 vanadium attachment sites in the synthesised structures. This assembly maintains a remarkably well ordered interlayer spacing, even when curved. The assemblies of interdigitated organic bilayers on V 2 O 5 are shown to be sufficiently flexible to tolerate curvature while maintaining a constant interlayer distance without rupture, delamination or cleavage. The accommodation of curvature and invariant structural integrity points to a beneficial role for oxide-directed organic <b>film</b> <b>packing</b> effects in layered architectures such as stacked nanofibers and hybrid 2 D nanosheet systems...|$|E

The new SAM films are prepared by depositing n-alkyl chains with OH-terminations onto Cl-terminated Si substrates. The chemical nature of the actual lubricating molecules, n-dodecyl, is kept constant in all three thin film systems for direct comparison and similarities and differences in tribological properties are observed. The adhesion strength is virtually identical for all three systems; however, frictional properties differ {{due to differences in}} <b>film</b> <b>packing.</b> Differences in the chemical bonds that attach the lubricant molecules to the substrate are also discussed as they influence variations in film wear and durability.

30|$|An {{alternative}} to the above interfacial layer is the organic self-assembled monolayer (SAM) [5] with sub-nanometer dimensions. The SAM [6, 7] composed of short aliphatic chains with desired terminal function groups has been investigated by modifying surface properties for the above requirement. The selectivity and adhesion strength between the function group of SAM and the substrate impact the <b>film</b> <b>packing</b> density and thermal stability, and the chain length also has influence on the packing density and order. In recent years, G. Ramanath has reported the technique of fabricating SAM with the organosilanes as Cu diffusion barrier layer, and interfacial adhesion in microelectronics devices [2, 8 – 12]. The {{results showed that the}} SAM inhibited Cu diffusion into substrate interface and enhanced the interfacial adhesion to increase the device lifetime [8, 13]. This technique has two advantages: (a) a strong interfacial bonding which can immobilize Cu, and (b) the creation of a vacuum-like potential barrier between Cu and the dielectric layer to inhibit Cu ionization and transport [14]. The former can be achieved through strong, local chemical interaction by choosing appropriate terminal groups, and the latter can be accomplished by using SAM with suitable chain length or the introduction of aromatic group. This technique offers the potential for tailoring effective barriers with decreased thickness.|$|E

Graphene oxide (GO) is a near- 2 D material derived via oxidation of graphite and exploited in nanocomposites and optoelectronics. Following a literature review, the modified Tour-Dimiev (MTD) method was {{singled out for}} making GO, {{with the introduction of}} modifications tailored towards producing large sheets by starting with a large graphite size, tuning the oxidation conditions, employing temperature control and a modified wash routine. The product was characterized using wide-angle x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy, revealing near completeness of graphite conversion, high oxygen content of GO and a comparable degree of defects to literature reports on the same. We imaged MTD-GO via fluorescence quenching microscopy (FQM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We compared the analytical capabilities of the image analysis software ImageJ with MATLAB, introducing several MATLAB subroutines to mitigate image analysis issues. We image-analyzed MTD-GO, concluding that GO size and thickness are statistically uncorrelated and described by lognormal and normal distributions respectively. We demonstrated that AFM captures small particles better than FQM, and that these two techniques can be combined to obtain a complete picture of polydisperse sample size distributions. Next, we modeled polydisperse dilute dispersions of oblate spheroids and discs in shear, uniaxial and biaxial extension using microhydrodynamic models found in the literature. We used the shear model to fit experimental shear data on a number of serially diluted sheet dispersions to obtain the dimensions and distributions thereof. The systems analyzed were MTD-GO, commercial GO before and after sonication, and a literature dataset on aqueous layered double hydroxides. Finally, we conducted novel Langmuir trough experiments with MTD-GO to understand the mechanisms surrounding the air-water interfacial assembly of GO. We were able to successfully transfer our films from the air-water interface onto a simple and versatile substrate such as surface-treated glass. We correlated film morphology in situ using Brewster Angle Microscopy and ex situ through FQM imaging of Langmuir-Blodgett-coated glass slides, to the pressure-area isotherm. We established that <b>film</b> <b>packing</b> occurs at low surface pressures. Finally, we showed that GO shows weak, pH-dependent intrinsic surface activity...|$|E
