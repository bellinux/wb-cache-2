5000|$|Registration of Births <b>and</b> <b>Deaths</b> - As the population, {{especially}} in the Maritime provinces grew exponentially during the British occupation of Sri Lanka, the British established administrative offices in the key cities and towns and ensured that all births <b>and</b> <b>deaths</b> were recorded <b>and</b> registered, while certificates were issued as proof that the incident had been officially recorded. In Sri Lanka, a system of registration of vital events i.e. births, <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> marriages has been in existence since 1867, when the Department of Registration of Births, <b>Deaths</b> <b>and</b> Marriages was established, following which registration of <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> births was made compulsory in 1897.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} important {{causes of}} premature mortality among Aboriginal {{adults in the}} Northern Territory (NT), 1979 - 1991. METHODS: All deaths of NT Aboriginal residents aged 15 - 64 years which occurred in the NT between 1979 and 1991 and which were recorded by the Registry of Births, <b>Deaths</b> <b>and</b> Marriages were included. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were {{used to compare the}} number of deaths observed among Aboriginals in the NT to those expected, based on overall Australian rates. Years of potential life lost before age 65 (YPLL 65) were estimated for specific causes of death. RESULTS: Aboriginal women (overall SMR, 5. 5) and Aboriginal men (SMR, 4. 7) experienced a high burden of excess mortality from almost every cause of death. This excess increased over time, especially for Aboriginal women. Among Aboriginal men, the most important causes of premature death were motor vehicle accidents (11 % of excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 17 % of YPLL 65), ischaemic heart disease (10 % of excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 10 % of YPLL 65), pneumonia and influenza (8 % of excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 6 % of YPLL 65), and homicide (7 % of excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 8 % of YPLL 65). For Aboriginal women, the most important causes included homicide (7 % of excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 11 % of YPLL 65), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (10 % of excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 5 % of YPLL 65), rheumatic heart disease (7 % of excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 8 % of YPLL 65), and ischaemic heart disease (6 % of excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 5 % of YPLL 65). CONCLUSIONS: The wide variety of causes of excess mortality will require an equally wide variety of solutions, both medical and non-medical, and a long term commitment will be necessary to achieve reductions in premature mortality among NT Aboriginal adults...|$|R
