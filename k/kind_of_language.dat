He wrote that the series influence on The Simpsons is [...] "acknowledged quite openly in the program itself," [...] and used a scene in [...] "Make Room for Lisa" [...] as an example. The scene shows Homer, Bart and Lisa visiting the Smithsonian Exhibition, where a jacket worn by Fonzie, a character from another 70's series, Happy Days, receives more attention from visitors than the Bill of Rights. It does however catch the attention of Homer, who picks it up and reads it while sitting in a wing chair owned by Archie Bunker, a character from All in the Family.

Music writers and other musicians have acknowledged the influence of the Kinks on the development of hard rock and heavy metal. Musicologist Joe Harrington stated: [...] "You Really Got Me', 'All Day and All of the Night' and 'I Need You' were predecessors of the whole three-chord genre ... the Kinks did a lot to help turn rock 'n' roll (Jerry Lee Lewis) into rock (Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Stooges)."

In this study, the writer intended to find out the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> style and the most dominant language style used by Barrack Obama and Michelle Obama in Oprah Winfrey show. In conducting this study, the writer uses qualitative research design, because it analyzes the data in the form of words.

The writer makes document analysis as the key instrument that collected the data from the official website of Oprah Winfrey Show. Data analysis of this study is analyzing and classifying the form <b>of</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> style used by Barrack and Michelle Obama, and identifying the most dominant form <b>of</b> <b>language</b> style. This study showed that Barrack and Michelle Obama used three <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> style; those are casual, consultative and formal styles.

He likened the differences in languages to the differences in games, arguing that {{just as there are}} many different games, each with different rules, so there are many different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>language.</b> Wittgenstein argued that different forms <b>of</b> <b>language</b> have different rules which determine what makes a proposition meaningful; outside of its language-game, a proposition is meaningless. He believed that the meaning of a proposition depends on its context and the rules of that context. Wittgenstein presented a language game as a situation in which certain <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> are used.

Commenting to Cherwell, she claimed her views on LGBT issues were [...] "very, very middle ground" [...] and that she had not said anything homophobic, but been the victim of [...] "a malicious witch hunt". Roweena Russell, former chair of the International Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Youth and Student Organisation, emailed Gasper to discuss the latter's comments, to which Gasper responded that Russell too should be institutionalised. Russell proceeded to condemn Gasper, stating that [...] "as a long-term political activist I'm disgusted she used this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>language.</b> Using mental health as a slur {{on top of everything else}} she's doing is just unacceptable."

2500|$|Indeed, {{the origin}} of language, {{understood}} as the human capacity of complex symbolic communication, and {{the origin of}} complex culture is often thought to stem from the same evolutionary process in early man. Evolutionary anthropologist Robin I. Dunbar has proposed that language evolved as early humans began to live in large communities which required the use of complex communication to maintain social coherence. Language and culture then both emerged {{as a means of}} using symbols to construct social identity and maintain coherence within a social group too large to rely exclusively on pre-human ways of building community such as for example grooming. Since language and culture are both in essence symbolic systems, twentieth century cultural theorists have applied the methods of analyzing language developed in the science of linguistics to also analyze culture. Particularly the structural theory of Ferdinand de Saussure which describes symbolic systems as consisting of signs (a pairing of a particular form with a particular meaning) has come to be applied widely in the study of culture. But also post-structuralist theories that nonetheless still rely on the parallel between language and culture as systems of symbolic communication, have been applied in the field of semiotics. The parallel between language and culture can then be understood as analog to the parallel between a linguistic sign, consisting for example of the sound [...] and the meaning [...] "cow", and a cultural sign, consisting for example of the cultural form of [...] "wearing a crown" [...] and the cultural meaning of [...] "being king". In this way {{it can be argued that}} culture is itself a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>language.</b> Another parallel between cultural and linguistic systems is that they are both systems of practice, that is, they are a set of special ways of doing things that is constructed and perpetuated through social interactions. Children, for example, acquire language in the same way as they acquire the basic cultural norms of the society they grow up in– through interaction with older members of their cultural group.|$|E

In literary work, it can be called as a figurative language. It is used to figure something through word, phrase, clause, and sentence.
