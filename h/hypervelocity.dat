Several million years later {{a thin layer}} of <b>hypervelocity</b> impact ejecta from the Sudbury impact event was deposited on the older, underlying, Gunflint Iron Formation, and the Rove was then deposited on top of the ejecta; it is estimated that at ground zero the earthquake generated by the meteor impact would have registered 10.2 on the Richter scale.|$|E
5|$|The Batmobile has two modes, {{which can}} be {{switched}} at any time: Pursuit and Battle. Pursuit is for moving from area to area and completing specific driving challenges. In Battle mode, the Batmobile becomes more tank than car, allowing a full 360-degree range of movement, including strafing in any direction, while revealing the multiple weapon systems on board, including a Vulcan chain gun for quick damage, a 60mm <b>hypervelocity</b> cannon for fire support, anti-tank guided missiles for wide-ranging damage against multiple targets, and a non-lethal riot suppressor.|$|E

5|$|Type Ia supernovae, {{that involve}} helium {{accretion}} {{by a white}} dwarf, have been proposed to be a channel for transformation {{of this type of}} stellar remnant. In this scenario, the carbon detonation produced in a Type Ia supernova is too weak to destroy the white dwarf, expelling just a small part of its mass as ejecta, but produces an asymmetric explosion that kicks the star, often known as a zombie star, to high speeds of a <b>hypervelocity</b> star. The matter processed in the failed detonation is re-accreted by the white dwarf with the heaviest elements such as iron falling to its core where it accumulates. These iron-core white dwarfs would be smaller than the carbon-oxygen kind of similar mass and would cool and crystallize faster than those.|$|E

25|$|Research out of <b>hypervelocity</b> railgun {{technology}} {{was done to}} build an information base about railguns so that SDI planners would know how to apply the technology to the proposed defense system. The SDI railgun investigation, called the Compact High Energy Capacitor Module Advanced Technology Experiment, {{had been able to}} fire two projectiles per day during the initiative. This represented a significant improvement over previous efforts, which were only able to achieve about one shot per month. <b>Hypervelocity</b> railguns are, at least conceptually, an attractive alternative to a space-based defense system because of their envisioned ability to quickly shoot at many targets. Also, since only the projectile leaves the gun, a railgun system can potentially fire many times before needing to be resupplied.|$|E

25|$|At one time, {{theories}} {{advocating the}} lunar origin of tektites enjoyed considerable support {{as part of}} a spirited controversy about the origin of tektites that occurred during the 1960s. Starting with the publication of research concerning lunar samples returned from the Moon, the consensus of Earth and planetary scientists shifted in favor of theories advocating a terrestrial impact versus lunar volcanic origin. For example, one problem with the lunar origin theory is that the arguments for it that are based upon the behavior of glass melts use data from pressures and temperatures that are vastly uncharacteristic of and unrelated to the extreme conditions of <b>hypervelocity</b> impacts. In addition, various studies have shown that <b>hypervelocity</b> impacts are likely quite capable of producing low volatile melts with extremely low water content. The consensus of Earth and planetary scientists regards the chemical, i.e. rare-earth, isotopic, and bulk composition evidence as decisively demonstrating that tektites are derived from terrestrial crustal rock, i.e. sedimentary rocks, that are unlike any known lunar crust.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{development}} effort is to capture dust particles at <b>hypervelocities</b> intact and unmelted {{in order to preserve}} volatile organics. At the same time, the capture process must minimize any organic elemental or compound contamination to prevent any compromise of exobiological analyses. Inorganic silicate aerogel has been developed as a successful capture medium to satisfy both requirements of intact capture and minimal organic contamination. Up to 6 km/s, silicate projectiles from a few microns up to 100 microns have been captured intact without any melting and with minimal loss of mass. Carbon in silicate aerogel can be reduced to less than 1 part in 1000 and hydrogen 3 parts in 1000 when baked in air. Under controlled inert gas environments, additional hydrocarbon reduction can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} capture {{projectiles}} intact at <b>hypervelocities</b> opens new applications {{in science and}} technology that would either not be possible or would be very costly by other means. This capability has been demonstrated in the laboratory for aluminum projectiles of 1. 6 mm diameter, captured at 6 km/s, in one unmelted piece, and retaining up to 95 % of the original mass. Furthermore, capture was accomplished passively using microcellular underdense polymer foam. Another advantage of capturing projectiles in an underdense medium is the ability of such a medium to preserve a record of the projectile's original velocity components of speed and direction. A survey of these experimental results is described in terms of a dozen parameters which characterize the amount of capture and the effect on the projectile due to different capture media...|$|R
5000|$|To {{search for}} many-body {{effects in the}} highly {{compressed}} stellar materials, Bae {{and his colleagues at}} BNL generated and studied such materials by impacting various bio and water nanoparticle at <b>hypervelocities</b> (v~100 km/s) on various targets. [...] In their study, anomalous signals were discovered, when the nanoparticles were directly impacted on and detected by Si particle detectors that had windows sufficiently thick enough to block the penetration of the nanoparticles completely. By exploiting the discovered anomalous signals, the feasibility of generating highly compressed [...] "stellar" [...] matter at shock pressures on the order of 10 TPa (100 Mbar) with the nanoparticle impact in a non-destructive laboratory setup was proven. However, the nature of the signals and the underlying physics of their generation mechanism had not been understood for 15 years.|$|R
25|$|A <b>hypervelocity</b> railgun {{works very}} much like a {{particle}} accelerator insofar as it converts electrical potential energy into kinetic energy imparted to the projectile. A conductive pellet (the projectile) is attracted down the rails by electric current flowing through a rail. Through the magnetic forces that this system achieves, a force is exerted on the projectile moving it down the rail. Railguns can generate muzzle-velocities in excess of 2.4 kilometers per second.|$|E

25|$|An {{impact crater}} is an {{approximately}} circular {{depression in the}} surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the <b>hypervelocity</b> impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} micrometeoroid {{impact on the}} optical {{properties}} of polished metals and thin film coatings has been simulated by accelerating micron-sized particles to <b>hypervelocities</b> in a shock tube. The degradation of these properties after exposure to simulated meteoroids was determined {{as a function of}} impacting kinetic energy/area of the particles. A calibrated sensor, 2000 -A Al/stainless steel, was developed to detect the micrometeoroid environment and to evaluate the degradation of the optical properties of thin aluminum films in space. No changes in the optical properties of the highly reflective surface sensor on SERT II, launched in 1970, were measured during 19 years in space. These results are found to be in agreement with the 1969 Micrometeoroid Flux Model. It is concluded that a highly reflective surface should lose less than 1 percent of its specular reflectance in near-earth orbit during 19 years...|$|R

The plasma generator creates a current through the helical coil which, in turn, generates a time varying magnetic field that generates a force which acts radially upon the plasma. A seal is carried {{on the end of}} the coaxial plasma generator for containing gas therein. As the plasma is accelerated out the outer end of the generator, it forces the gas outwardly also compressing such. Beads are carried adjacent the small end of the helical shaped coil for being accelerated to <b>hypervelocities</b> by the plasma and gas. As a result of utilizing gas in the coaxial plasma generator, such minimizes ablation of the beads as well as accelerates such to higher velocities...|$|R
3000|$|PS quite {{frequently}} serves in such {{materials as}} the core polymer component due not only to its good thermal and chemical stability, mechanical characteristics, biocompatibility, etc. [19] but probably to its convenience for synthesis of well-shaped nano/submicron/micron-sized particles being very suitable for the (nano)composites with specific applications. For example, micron/submicron-sized PS particles coated with doped PANI were used in electrostatic accelerators, which allowed accelerating the charged particles to <b>hypervelocities</b> [20] or in electrorheological fluids [21], etc. Similar to other core-shell (nano)composites [22] PS/PANI ones obviously have potential for sensing applications. However, to our knowledge, {{there is a lack}} of information on using PS/PANI core-shell (nano)composites as sensing materials. Nevertheless, recently, it was shown that mixing PS dissolved in toluene with PANI particles doped with camphorsulfonic acid gave dispersions, suitable for formation of the composite films sensitive to ammonia [23].

25|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{consensus of}} Earth and planetary scientists is that tektites consist of terrestrial debris that was ejected during {{the formation of}} an impact crater. During the extreme conditions created by an <b>hypervelocity</b> meteorite impact, near-surface terrestrial sediments and rocks were either melted, vaporized, or some combination of these and ejected from an impact crater. After ejection from the impact crater, the material formed millimeter- to centimeter-sized bodies of molten material, which as they re-entered the atmosphere, rapidly cooled to form tektites that fell to Earth to create a layer of distal ejecta hundreds or thousands of kilometers away from the impact site.|$|E
25|$|Several {{phenomena}} {{are well}} documented during witnessed meteorite falls {{too small to}} produce <b>hypervelocity</b> craters. The fireball that occurs as the meteoroid passes through the atmosphere can appear to be very bright, rivaling the sun in intensity, although most are far dimmer and {{may not even be}} noticed during daytime. Various colors have been reported, including yellow, green, and red. Flashes and bursts of light can occur as the object breaks up. Explosions, detonations, and rumblings are often heard during meteorite falls, which can be caused by sonic booms as well as shock waves resulting from major fragmentation events. These sounds can be heard over wide areas, with a radius of a hundred or more kilometers. Whistling and hissing sounds are also sometimes heard, but are poorly understood. Following passage of the fireball, {{it is not unusual for}} a dust trail to linger in the atmosphere for several minutes.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the formation of and widespread distribution of tektites requires the intense (superheated) melting of near-surface sediments and rocks at the impact site and the following high-velocity ejection of this material from the impact crater, the exact processes involved remain poorly understood. One possible mechanism {{for the formation of}} tektites is by the jetting of highly shocked and superheated melt during the initial contact/compression stage of impact crater formation. Alternatively, various mechanisms involving the dispersal of shock-melted material by an expanding vapor plume, which is created by a <b>hypervelocity</b> impact, have been used to explain the formation of tektites. Any mechanism by which tektites are created must explain chemical data that suggest that parent material from which tektites were created came from near-surface rocks and sediments at an impact site. In addition, the scarcity of known strewn fields relative to the number of identified Impact craters indicate that very special and rarely met circumstances are required in order for tektites to be created by a meteorite impact.|$|E
40|$|Polypyrrole (PPy) {{has been}} {{deposited}} from aqueous solution onto submicrometer-sized sulfur-rich poly-[bis(4 -vinylthiophenyl) sulfide] (PMPV) latex particles. The PMPV seed particles and resulting composite particles were extensively characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, helium pycnometry, Raman spectroscopy, and electrical conductivity measurements. Four-point probe measurements on pressed pellets indicate conductivities of around 6 x 10 - 5 S cm- 1 for a polypyrrole loading of approximately 11. 5 %. This suggests a somewhat patchy, nonuniform polypyrrole overlayer, {{which is consistent}} with our Raman spectroscopy studies. Despite their relatively low conductivities, these polypyrrole-coated PMPV latexes can be accelerated up to <b>hypervelocities</b> (> 20 km s- 1) using a high voltage (2 MV) van de Graaf instrument. In view of their high sulfur contents (ca. 28 %), these new electrically conductive latexes are expected to be interesting synthetic mimics for understanding the behavior of sulfur-based micrometeorites, whose existence has been postulated by planetary scientists investigating signs of volcanic activity on one of Jupiter's moons (Io) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{capability}} for capturing micrometeoroid analogs intact through laboratory simulations in passive underdense media offers {{a valuable tool}} for cosmic dust research. However, no amount of laboratory simulations can replace actual space experiments due to the technical inability to launch high fidelity analogs of micrometeoroids in ground laboratories and then reliably simulating high <b>hypervelocities</b> (greater than 7 km/s). Fluffy composite micrometeoroid analogs tend to break up and have not survived laboratory launches at beyond 4 km/s, however, a new technique of launching cluster analogs was developed for the two-stage light-gas gun at NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range. Plasma drag or electrostatic accelerators {{may be able to}} achieve higher speeds than two-stage light-gas guns but only with very limited projectile compositions and may result in severe projectile deformation.

40|$|A {{resurgence}} {{of interest in}} placing large solar concentrator solar dynamic systems in space for power generation has brought up again a concern for maintaining {{the integrity of the}} optical properties of highly specular reflecting surfaces in the near earth space environment. One of the environmental hazards needing evaluation is the micrometeoroid environment. It has been shown that highly reflective polished metals and thin film coatings degrade when exposed to simulated micrometeoroids in the lab. At NASA-Lewis, a shock tube was used to simulate the phenomenon of micrometeoroid impact by accelerating micron sized particles to <b>hypervelocities.</b> Any changes in the optical properties of surfaces exposed to this impact were then evaluated. The degradation of optical properties of polished metals and thin metallic films after exposure to simulated micrometeoroids was determined as a function of impacting kinetic energy area of the particles.

These clusters are similar in size distribution to the globular clusters of the Milky Way, with most having an effective radius between 1 and 6 parsecs. The size of the M87 clusters shows a gradual increase with distance from the galactic center. The first <b>hypervelocity</b> globular cluster, HVGC-1, was discovered escaping M87. The discovery of HVGC-1 suggests that the core of M87 held not one but two supermassive black holes.

This chapter summarizes the techniques {{used to determine}} the properties of circumplanetary material, and then gives a precis of the known characteristics of circumplanetary rings (with emphasis on tenuous structures) and dust grains, before describing some of the physics and orbital dynamics relevant to them. Jupiter’s dusty rings (as discovered by the Voyager and Galileo spacecraft) have three components: i) a radially confined and vertically extended halo which rises abruptly, probably due to an electromagnetic resonance; ii) a 6500 -km-wide flattened main ring that shows patchiness and whose outer edge is bounded by the orbit of the satellite Adrastea; and iii) a pair of exterior gossamer rings that seem to be derived from the satellites Amalthea and Thebe whose orbits circumscribe these rings.

40|$|The Universal Particle Detector Experiment (UPDE), which {{consists}} of parallel planes of two diode laser beams of different wavelengths and a large surface metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) impact detector, is proposed. It {{will be used to}} perform real-time monitoring of contamination particles and meteoroids impacting the spacecraft surface with high resolution of time, position, direction, and velocity. The UPDE will discriminate between contaminants and meteoroids, and will determine their velocity and size distribution around the spacecraft environment. With two different color diode lasers, the contaminant and meteroid composition will also be determined based on laboratory calibration with different materials. Secondary particles dislodged from the top aluminum surface of the MOS detector will also be measured to determine the kinetic energy losses during energetic meteoroid impacts. The velocity range of this instrument is 0. 1 m/s to more than 14 km/s, while its size sensitivity is from 0. 2 microns to millimeter-sized particles. The particulate measurements in space of the kind proposed will be the first simultaneous multipurpose particulate experiment that includes velocities from very slow to <b>hypervelocities,</b> sizes from submicrometer- to pellet-sized diameters, chemical analysis of the particulate composition, and measurements of the kinetic energy losses after energetic impacts of meteroids. The experiment will provide contamination particles and orbital debris data that are critically needed for our present understanding of the space environment.

40|$|Recent {{proper motion}} and {{parallax}} measurements for the pulsar PSR B 1508 + 55 indicate a transverse velocity of ~ 1100 km/s, which exceeds earlier measurements for any neutron star. The spin-down characteristics of PSR B 1508 + 55 are typical for a non-recycled pulsar, which {{implies that the}} velocity of the pulsar cannot have originated from the second supernova disruption of a massive binary system. The high velocity of PSR B 1508 + 55 can {{be accounted for by}} assuming that it received a kick at birth or that the neutron star was accelerated after its formation in the supernova explosion. We propose an explanation for the origin of hyperfast neutron stars based on the hypothesis that they could be the remnants of a symmetric supernova explosion of a high-velocity massive star which attained its peculiar velocity (similar to that of the pulsar) {{in the course of a}} strong dynamical three- or four-body encounter in the core of dense young star cluster. To check this hypothesis we investigated three dynamical processes involving close encounters between: (i) two hard massive binaries, (ii) a hard binary and an intermediate-mass black hole, and (iii) a single star and a hard binary intermediate-mass black hole. We find that main-sequence O-type stars cannot be ejected from young massive star clusters with peculiar velocities high enough to explain the origin of hyperfast neutron stars, but lower mass main-sequence stars or the stripped helium cores of massive stars could be accelerated to <b>hypervelocities.</b> Our explanation for the origin of hyperfast pulsars requires a very dense stellar environment of the order of 10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 7 stars pc^{- 3 }. Although such high densities may exist during the core collapse of young massive star clusters, we caution that they have never been observed.
