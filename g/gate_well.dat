For the chain of terraces we find substituted a simple garden, somewhat formally laid out; but redeemed from the charge of meanness by the nobility and size attained by most of its trees; the line of immense cypresses which generally surrounds it in part, and the luxuriance of the vegetation of its flowering shrubs. It has frequently a large entrance <b>gate,</b> <b>well</b> designed, but carelessly executed; sometimes singularly adorned with fragments of ancient sculpture, regularly introduced, which the spectator partly laments, as preserved in a mode so incongruous with their ancient meaning, and partly rejoices over, as preserved at all. The grottoes of the superior garden are here replaced by light ranges of arched summerhouses, designed in stucco, and occasionally adorned in their interior with fresco paintings of considerable brightness and beauty.|$|E

The workmen were at the gate to see him off, and were mightily proud of him. 'Good luck to you, Mr Doyce!' said one of the number. 'Wherever you go, they'll find as they've got a man among 'em, a man as knows his tools and as his tools knows, a man as is willing and a man as is able, and if that's not a man, where is a man!' This oration from a gruff volunteer in the back-ground, not previously suspected of any powers in that way, was received with three loud cheers; and the speaker became a distinguished character for ever afterwards. In the midst of the three loud cheers, Daniel gave them all a hearty 'Good Bye, Men!' and the coach disappeared from sight, as if the concussion of the air had blown it out of Bleeding Heart Yard.|$|E

40|$|The {{transport}} of atoms is experimentally studied in a transistor-like triple-well potential {{consisting of a}} narrow <b>gate</b> <b>well</b> surrounded by source and drain wells. Atoms are initially loaded into the source well with pre-determined temperature and chemical potential. Energetic atoms flow from the source, across the gate, and into the drain where they are removed using a resonant light beam. The manifestation of atom-atom interactions and dissipation is evidenced by a rapid population growth in the initially vacant <b>gate</b> <b>well.</b> The transport dynamics are shown to depend strongly on a feedback parameter determined by the relative heights of the two barriers forming the gate region. For a range of feedback parameter values, experiments establish that the gate atoms develop a larger chemical potential and lower temperature {{than those in the}} source.

40|$|The {{development}} of a fish-diversion system {{to be used in}} the turbine intakes of the Wanapum and Priest Rapids developments on the Columbia River, in the state of Washington, is described. The system uses a passive-bar screen, installed through the emergency <b>gate</b> <b>well,</b> to produce a flow pattern that deflects downstream-migrating juvenile salmonids into the <b>gate</b> <b>well</b> for subsequent removal and bypass to below the dam. The system is based on laboratory model studies and field tests. The model studies provide data on the hydraulic performance of the system and result in an understanding of the hydraulic features of the technique, which can be a guide for future designs. The studies also serve as a guide to {{development of}} the structural design of the system. The design, field tested in 1986, 1987, and 1988, attains a fish-guidance efficiency of about 68 % with a minimum of descaling (removal of fish scales by abrasion) ...|$|E

40|$|An atomtronic {{transistor}} circuit {{is used to}} realize a driven matterwave oscillator. The transistor consists of Source and Drain regions separated by a narrow <b>Gate</b> <b>well.</b> Quasi-steady-state behavior is determined from a thermodynamic model, which reveals two oscillation threshold regimes. One {{is due to the}} onset of Bose-Einstein condensation in the <b>Gate</b> <b>well,</b> the other is due to the appearance of a negative transresistance regime of the transistor. The thresholds of oscillation are shown to be primarily dependent on the potential energy height difference between Gate-Drain and Gate-Source barriers. The transistor potential is established with a combination of magnetic and optical fields using a compound glass and silicon substrate atom chip. The onset of oscillation and the output matterwave are observed through in-trap imaging. Time-of-flight absorption imaging is used to determine the time dependence of the Source well thermal and chemical energies as well as to estimate the value of the closed-loop ohmic Gate resistance, which is negative and is observed to cause cooling of Source atoms.
