5|$|Clark {{set himself}} three initial goals in {{civilian}} lifeâ€”to earn $40 {{million in the}} business world and practice philanthropy, to become an adjunct professor, and to become a professional golfer. Clark began a public speaking tour in the summer of 2000 and approached several former government officials for advice on work after life in government, including <b>House</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich, White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty, and Richard Holbrooke. Clark took McLarty's advice to move back to Little Rock, Arkansas, and took a position with the Stephens Group, an investment firm headquartered there. He took several other board positions at defense-related firms, and in March 2003 he amicably left the Stephens Group to found Wesley K. Clark & Associates. Clark wrote two books, Waging Modern War and Winning Modern Wars. He also authored forewords for a series of military biographies and a series of editorials. He had amassed only about $3.1 million towards his $40 million goal by 2003, and he began considering running for public office instead of pursuing his business career.|$|E

25|$|Unlike in Westminster style legislatures or as {{with the}} Senate Majority Leader, the House Majority Leader's duties and {{prominence}} vary depending upon the style {{and power of the}} <b>Speaker</b> of the <b>House.</b> Typically, the <b>Speaker</b> does not participate in debate and rarely votes on the floor.
