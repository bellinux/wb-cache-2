5|$|Players can use {{a variety}} of methods to {{approach}} missions. For instance, players can utilize stealth to evade <b>enemies</b> and complete objectives without being noticed, or they also have the option to assault <b>enemies</b> with firearms and vehicles. The player-character is equipped with a digital camera, which allows him to mark and highlight all visible <b>enemies,</b> animals, and loots. Players are also able to ride on elephants, which serve as tank-like offensive weapons. Players can throw bait towards <b>enemies,</b> which attracts nearby wildlife that is hostile to both the player and <b>enemies.</b> Players can also hunt and skin animals.|$|E
5|$|A {{collision}} with purple <b>enemies</b> is fatal to the character, whereas the green <b>enemies</b> {{are removed from}} the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen <b>enemies</b> for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all <b>enemies</b> and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{introduces}} a new ability system, Tactical Soul system, to the Castlevania series. It involves absorbing {{the souls of}} <b>enemies</b> {{in order to gain}} additional abilities. Except for human <b>enemies</b> and the game's final opponent, all souls can be absorbed by the player. The rate at which enemies' souls are obtained varies between <b>enemies.</b> Players can trade souls between two Aria of Sorrow cartridges using two Game Boy Advance consoles and a link cable.|$|E

5|$|As players {{walk through}} the level, they are stopped by groups of <b>enemies</b> who must be {{defeated}} before they can continue. The level ends when all the <b>enemies</b> are defeated. Each level contains many identical groups of <b>enemies,</b> making these games notable for their repetition. In beat 'em up games, players often fight a boss—an enemy much stronger than the other enemies—at {{the end of each}} level.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>enemies</b> {{and their}} bullets can be shot down. Defeating <b>enemies</b> will {{sometimes}} reveal item boxes, which can hold precious metals such as {{gold and silver}} for extra points, and bombs. Only five bombs can be held at a time, {{which can be used}} to clear the screen of <b>enemies.</b> Weapon upgrades may appear after defeating certain <b>enemies.</b> These weapons, such as shotguns and machine guns, will increase the player's firing speed or damage output. When a player's bullets hit an enemy, a gauge {{at the bottom of the}} screen will gradually fill. Once filled, the player will be awarded with a Vulcan gun, the most powerful weapon in the game which grants invincibility. The gauge will then begin to deplete and the Vulcan gun will disappear once empty.|$|E

5|$|Both of {{the episodes}} contain a {{different}} set of <b>enemies</b> in their levels, which the player must stun or avoid. The first episode contains a variety of alien creatures, including large slugs, giant bouncing mushrooms, and flying bats, while the second contains different types of robots and alien energy beings. Levels can also include hazards, such as dart traps or fire; touching a hazard or most <b>enemies</b> causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. The episodes feature three difficulty settings, which change the number and types of <b>enemies</b> present. While Vorticons contained a raygun and the in-between episode Commander Keen in Keen Dreams had pellets that temporarily stunned <b>enemies,</b> Goodbye, Galaxy features a stun gun that knocks out most <b>enemies</b> permanently using ammo found throughout the game. Different <b>enemies</b> take differing numbers of shots to kill, or in some cases are immune. The player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. The first episode also contains water droplets which award an extra life for every 100 drops, and the second green drinks which do the same. There are also colored keycards which grant access to locked parts of levels, and items which instantly grant an extra life.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Soul Reaver is a hack and slash system, {{involving}} {{the use of}} combinations of various different attacks before a finishing move. Raziel's <b>enemies</b> are grouped into humans, spectral creatures, and most commonly, vampires. Human <b>enemies</b> include peasants, vampire hunters and vampire worshippers. In the spectral realm, players fight minor <b>enemies</b> called Sluagh and the souls of dead vampires who have become wraiths. Each brood of vampire <b>enemies</b> has unique powers reminiscent of their clan leader. Human and spectral <b>enemies</b> can be killed with Raziel's claws or any weapon, but vampires must be bludgeoned into a stunned state and then destroyed by impaling them, lighting them on fire, or tossing them into a hazard such as sunlight or water. When killed, <b>enemies</b> leave behind souls that replenish Raziel's health, which automatically decreases in the material realm and increases in the spectral. Possession of the Soul Reaver sword stops automatic degeneration of health in the physical realm, but Raziel loses the sword instantly if he sustains damage and can regain it only by restoring his health to full.|$|E
5|$|Crash has {{the ability}} to jump into the air and land on an enemy character, spin in a tornado-like fashion to knock <b>enemies</b> off-screen, slide across the ground, and perform a body slam to break certain objects. Crash can jump higher than he {{normally}} can if he jumps immediately following a slide. All of these techniques can be used as offensive measures against most <b>enemies,</b> whom serve to deter Crash's progress. <b>Enemies</b> with deadly topsides cannot be jumped on, while <b>enemies</b> that attack from the front or have side spikes must be jumped on or undergo a body slam. <b>Enemies</b> with sharp necklines (such as frill-necked lizards or long-legged robots with heated circumferences) can only be defeated if Crash slides into them.|$|E

5|$|<b>Enemies,</b> {{encountered}} in environments as icons, react differently {{depending on how}} they are approached and attacked: using the right attack or approaching them unawares grants the party an advantage in battle. If other groups of <b>enemies</b> are close by, they are also drawn into the initiated battle. For both player characters and <b>enemies,</b> battle skills and character performance can be affected by elemental attributes. Status ailments can also be inflicted by both the party and <b>enemies.</b> They are divided into physical ailments and magical ailments, which {{have a variety of}} negative effects: physical effects can be effects like slowing or poisoning a character, while magical ailments can cause units to turn on their allies or automatically recover a knocked-out party member. Items used on characters can restore TP or HP, or remove status ailments. Characters learn new skills during battles, along with Titles that affect aspects of characters.|$|E
5|$|Escape {{from the}} fetters, flee from the <b>enemies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Players use melee attacks, firearms, and {{explosives}} to fight <b>enemies,</b> and may run, jump, and occasionally swim to navigate through the locations. Melee attacks {{can be used}} to silently take down <b>enemies</b> without being detected. Alternatively, players can ambush <b>enemies,</b> which often results in an intense firefight between the two parties.|$|E
50|$|Enemy-related {{injuries}} which {{justify the}} award of the Purple Heart include: injury caused by <b>enemy</b> bullet, shrapnel, or other projectile created by <b>enemy</b> action; injury caused by <b>enemy</b> placed land mine, naval mine, or trap; injury caused by <b>enemy</b> released chemical, biological, or nuclear agent; injury caused by vehicle or aircraft accident resulting from <b>enemy</b> fire; and, concussion injuries caused {{as a result}} of <b>enemy</b> generated explosions.|$|R
5000|$|A player moves their piece {{between two}} <b>enemy</b> pieces (or between {{two lines of}} <b>enemy</b> pieces) {{in such a way}} that one of the <b>enemy</b> pieces (or one of the lines of <b>enemy</b> pieces) is on the same row, and the other <b>enemy</b> piece (or the other line of <b>enemy</b> pieces) is on the same column, and that each <b>enemy</b> piece (or each of the two lines of <b>enemy</b> pieces) is flanked on the other side by a {{friendly}} piece of the same row or column respectively (with no vacant space between any of them), this is cause for the capture of the two <b>enemy</b> pieces (or of the two lines of <b>enemy</b> pieces). In this case, two custodian captures were performed but one was on a row, and the other was on a column.|$|R

5|$|Quantum Break is an action-adventure {{video game}} played from a third-person perspective. Players play as Jack Joyce, who has time {{manipulation}} powers {{in a world}} where time stutters, making everything freeze except Joyce. Players face a variety of <b>enemies,</b> including Monarch security guards; Strikers, who are equipped with specially-designed suits which allow them to manipulate time; and Juggernauts, heavily armored <b>enemies</b> equipped with very strong firearms. Different <b>enemies</b> have different behaviors, and the game requires players to deploy different tactics and strategies in order to defeat them.|$|E
5|$|Raziel retains most of {{the powers}} he possessed in the {{previous}} game, such as the abilities to glide, climb walls, fire bolts of telekinetic energy, and swim. To sustain his strength and travel between the planes, he must devour souls; this is typically accomplished by defeating <b>enemies.</b> The game's combat consists of a hack and slash system, entailing the use of combinations of attacks before executing a finishing move. Human <b>enemies</b> exist only in the material world, and include mercenaries, demon hunters, and the Sarafan, a monastic order of vampire hunters; other material creatures include dogs, thralls, and mutants. Sluagh are <b>enemies</b> who exclusively inhabit the spirit world, whereas cross-planar beings such as demons and shades can pursue the player between both realms. <b>Enemies</b> leave behind souls when killed, which replenish Raziel's health once consumed.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{criticized the}} AI, which some found inconsistent. Whitehead criticized his {{experience}} of <b>enemies</b> that can see Corvo {{from a great}} distance yet sometimes remain unaware of him while in his enemies' peripheral vision. Juba criticized the inconsistent detection by <b>enemies</b> that lead to unpredictable and unreliable stealth mechanics that could force stealth-focused players into a combat situation, for which their character is not built. According to G4's Jake Gaskill, the AI worked well in combat, with <b>enemies</b> employing different tactics and effectively countering attacks, but when not alerted, <b>enemies</b> would ignore actions directly in front of them. Watters also mentioned lulls in enemy intelligence, but he said that it remained tenacious enough to keep the <b>enemies</b> formidable.|$|E
5000|$|A player moves their piece {{between three}} <b>enemy</b> pieces (or between three lines of <b>enemy</b> pieces) {{in such a}} way that two of the <b>enemy</b> pieces (or two lines of <b>enemy</b> pieces) are on the same row (or column), and the third <b>enemy</b> piece (or third line of <b>enemy</b> pieces) is on the same column (or row), and that each <b>enemy</b> piece (each of the three lines of <b>enemy</b> pieces) is flanked on the other side by a {{friendly}} piece of the same row or column respectively (with no vacant space between any of them), this is cause for the capture of the three <b>enemy</b> pieces (or of the three lines of <b>enemy</b> pieces). In this case, three custodian captures were performed but two were on a row (or column), and the other was on a column (or row).|$|R
50|$|As a result, the <b>enemy</b> made a feint withdrawal. After a few minutes, the <b>enemy</b> {{launched}} a counterattack against Platoon 8. At {{that same time}} Major Ismail and Platoon 9 faced an attack from another <b>enemy</b> group. Artillery support was requested through Battalion Headquarters at Klian Intan Camp. While waiting for the requested artillery support, Ismail and his group managed to surround the <b>enemy.</b> In this position, he and his group exchanged fire with the <b>enemy,</b> successfully killing another and wounding {{a few of the}} <b>enemy.</b> As the artillery fire bore down on the <b>enemy</b> he directed his men to continue firing on the surrounded <b>enemy.</b> The <b>enemy</b> was estimated to be some 70 strong and armed with automatic weapons and high explosives.|$|R

5|$|The CAMS {{attack in}} set patterns, and their next moves are {{indicated}} by visual and aural cues. The player avoids these attacks via evasive spins, rolls and other maneuvers. Vanessa cannot move while attacking, {{and so the}} player must often use the environment as cover. Defeated <b>enemies</b> sometimes drop items that replenish health and energy or that trigger a combo timer, which multiplies the points earned from <b>enemies</b> destroyed consecutively. Each mission {{takes place in a}} series of rooms that contain a fixed number of <b>enemies</b> and may include a boss robot. At the end of a mission, the player receives a score {{based on the number of}} rooms explored and <b>enemies</b> destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{artificial}} intelligence in Halo has been favorably received. <b>Enemies</b> take cover and use suppressive fire and grenades. Some <b>enemies</b> retreat when their superiors are killed. The player is often aided by United Nations Space Command (UNSC) Marines, who offer ground support, such as manning gun turrets or riding shotgun while the player is driving a vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dawn of Mana {{is called the}} Mono system, based around the Havok physic engine. Almost all objects in the game, {{including}} <b>enemies,</b> are moveable, allowing Keldric to throw objects at <b>enemies,</b> or even throw other monsters. Keldric can either throw objects in the direction he is facing, or can target a specific enemy or object to aim at them. When something is thrown near an enemy, they Panic, resulting in a counter over their head that counts down to zero to end the Panic. While panicked, <b>enemies</b> take more damage from attacks and spells. Defeating <b>enemies</b> when they are panicked gives the player two types of medals, which can either boost the player's health and attack damage, or mana and magic damage. Throwing multiple objects can Panic <b>enemies</b> more; when the Panic meter is greater than 99 the player can receive better medals. Defeating <b>enemies</b> also grants experience points, which raise Keldric and Faye's level up {{to a maximum of}} four, granting higher health, mana, and damage, and granting new spells and attacks. In addition to being throwable, many objects in the game are also destructible.|$|E
