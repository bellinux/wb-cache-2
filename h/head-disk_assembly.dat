5000|$|Conner's drives were {{notable for}} eschewing the [...] "tub" [...] type of <b>head-disk</b> <b>assembly,</b> where the disks are inside a large base casting {{shaped like a}} square bowl or vault with a flat lid; instead, they {{preferred}} the flat base plate approach, which was more resistant to shock {{and less likely to}} warp or deform when heated. Their first drives had the base plate carrying the disks, head arm and actuator enclosed inside a long aluminum cartridge, fixed to a bulkhead on the other side with two screws and sealed with a large, square O-ring. Conner's 1/3-height (1-inch thick) drives used a domed, cast aluminum lid with four screws, one on each corner, sealed to the base plate with a rubber gasket. The printed circuit board was bolted {{to the bottom of the}} base plate, with the mounting holes for the drive drilled into tabs cast into the sides of the base plate. This design would be Conner's trademark look well into the 1990s.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{study on the}} shock response of a contact recording head when a half-sine acceleration impulse {{is applied to the}} <b>head-disk</b> <b>assembly</b> system. The contact head is modeled by a cantilever beam with a concentrated mass at the tip. The surface undulation and the vibration of disk are both taken into account in the analysis. The contact force between the head and the disk is assumed to follow the Hertz theory. The head jumping height and the coiltact force between the head and the disk are studied in detail. The obtained results show that the maximum jumping height and contact force are significantly dependent on the amplitude and duration of the applied impulsive disturbance...|$|E
50|$|The IBM 3350 Direct Access Storage Facility, code-named Madrid, was {{introduced}} in 1975 for use with IBM System/370. Its non-removable <b>head-disk</b> <b>assemblies</b> (HDAs) are sealed and included the head and arm assembly. The 3350 disk geometry is 555 cylinders, 30 heads, and 19069 bytes per track which give each HDA a storage capacity of 317,498,850 bytes. Sealed HDAs were standard practice on all IBM DASD hereafter.|$|R
