40|$|Measuring {{of large}} forces up to 10 MN with high {{accuracy}} {{is a complex}} subject, blending theory, practice and applications, with a special accent {{in the field of}} Metrology. It is simply to generate complex shapes of mono-block elastic structures starting from simple shapes of strain gage measuring sections, the axisymmetrical ones being the best suited in this respect. The body of the force transducer is easy to design by 2 D axisymmetric FEM and easy to manufacture. The paper have in view a unified approach of square (type A) and rectangle (type B). Square section is among the few with an analytical but complicated formula, having two strain gauges tangentially located {{on the outside of the}} ring torsion and the other two strain gauges, which complete the Wheatstone bridge, being diametrically opposed. The rectangular section (with different ratios between the two sides but without analytical formula), is obtained by a minimum modification of the previous one (making two slots), the strain gauges being circumferentially located on the upper and the lower faces. We formulate a standard FEA procedure for axisymmetrical <b>elastic</b> <b>elements</b> of strain <b>gauged</b> force transducers using ANSYS Mechanical program.
