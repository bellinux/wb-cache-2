40|$|Annotation The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} a project of a new building of a family farmhouse with accommodation situated in the cadastral area of Lezník. The farmhouse {{is sitting on the}} suburb of the village and is surrounded by old original barns. This house is designed for a family of 5 members. A part of the farmhouse is used as a Bed and Breakfast for up to 12 people. Each part of the house (living and accommodation) has got its own entrance. The building is covered with a <b>double</b> <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> in an L shape. The roof above the living kitchen is designed as a shed (lean to) roof. For the main wall structural system we have used Porotherm system, apart from the gables which are constructed as a wooden structure due to the size and unusual shapes of windows. The facade is designed as a combination of direct external insulation and ventilated facade. Documentation has been prepared for this building construction. The graphical part of this documentation has been processed in the AUTOCAD software...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} is structured around two parallel tracks; one {{linked to the}} historical reconstruction of the implementation phases {{of the church of}} St. Mary of Loreto in Rome, on which there is an interesting and detailed archive of material and a small bibliography; the other involves the comparison between the original Sangallo project and the instrumental survey of the existing situation through a specific photographic campaign. It is interesting to point out the existing similarities that were revealed between this comparison, which led to a 3 D reconstruction of the project in phase 1. The research project is configured as a monographic study of the Church, but especially {{on one of the most}} significant phases of the construction. In particular, themes connected to a check of the initial project (1507 - 1509) were investigated in depth and, therefore, also the ones that were more strictly connected to the construction plan of the church, from the moment the works were started to their completion (1509 - 1580). This phase is well documented in the text of S. Benedetti on the church, but there aren't any pictures or drawings made by others other than the author's to document this phase. The only iconographic documentation is the Map of Rome of 1561 by Giovanni Antonio Dosio, in which the church is reproduced as far as its foundation is concerned with a <b>double</b> <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> and, later, also in an engraving of Cavallieri (National Cabinet of Prints, no. 121). As far as the attribution of the original project is concerned, one of the first examples of a church with a central plan is the one built in Rome in the first half of the sixteenth century. The bibliographical sources and archives agree on when the works started, around 1507 - 1509, while there still is some doubt as to whether the work was attributed to Bramante or Antonio da Sangallo. The work method with which the research was made is based on the analysis and elaboration of the data retrieved during the archival research and on the field. The photographic campaign substantially allowed us to reconstruct the church and provided the numerical data needed to carry out the dimensional check between the current state and the original designs. The historical documents used for this reconstruction were preserved in the Archive of the Pio Sodalizio dei Fornari of Rome. As far as the iconographic sources are concerned, we consulted: the National Cabinet of Prints of Rome, the Municipal Cabinet of Prints of Rome and, finally, the “Congregazione del Censo” fund of the State Archive of Rome. The building implementation of the church of St. Mary of Loreto, made possible thanks to offers and the legacies of the Fornari, was linked to spontaneous initiatives, reason for which a continuous execution of the works was not ensured, which made the historical reconstruction and its implementation phases more complex. As confirmed by Sandro Benedetti, the first building phase, the one that dates back to 1507 - 1576, is without a doubt the one that most significantly marked the importance the church would have had over the century for the religious community. It would soon become a place of worship for the entire Fornari community that resided in the area surrounding the Alessandrino District. The evolution of the church can be narrowed down into two phases: the first, from the foundations of 1507 to 1552 when the building reached the first level, or the base ground up to the frame. This phase was attributed to Antonio da Sangallo and also to Bramante in part. The external architectural layout was achieved in the only main façade around 1550, while the other two were completed around 1573 and 1574 by Giacomo del Duca. The second, from 1577 to 1580, and in which the complex dome system was entirely built. The date on which the works started is cited by Armellini, Lanciani and finally confirmed in the documents contained in the church's archives and which show the original foundation bull issued by Giulio II. The works actually started again in 1577 and, if we compare the date 1592 engraved in the base of the dome, we immediately see it took twenty years to accomplish the dome...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of a roof is to resist water. Two broad categories of roofs are flat and <b>pitched.</b> Flat <b>roofs</b> actually slope up to 10° or 15° but are built to resist standing water. <b>Pitched</b> <b>roofs</b> are designed to shed water but not resist standing water which can occur during wind-driven rain or ice damming. Typically residential, <b>pitched</b> <b>roofs</b> are covered with an underlayment material beneath the roof covering material as a second line of defense. Domestic roof construction may also be ventilated to help remove moisture from leakage and condensation.|$|R
