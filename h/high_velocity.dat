5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> in {{proportion}} to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk {{on the surface of the}} water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E

She is sent flying through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
5|$|FN Herstal was {{the first}} small arms {{manufacturer}} to respond to NATO's requirement; FN started by developing a shoulder-fired personal defense weapon, the P90, along with a small caliber, <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> 5.7×28mm cartridge type. The original 5.7×28mm cartridge, called the SS90, went into production with the P90 in 1990. The SS90 propelled a 1.5g (23grain) plastic-core projectile from the P90 at a muzzle velocity of roughly 850m/s (2,800ft/s). Shortly after its introduction, the P90 was adopted and used in service with the Belgian special forces group in the 1991 Gulf War.|$|E
5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in water density is negligible (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at <b>high</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|E

5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} weighs 6.0grams (93grains)—roughly {{half as much}} as {{a typical}} 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge—making extra ammunition less burdensome, or allowing more ammunition to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge also has a relatively small diameter, a relatively high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it has roughly 30 percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability. Due to its <b>high</b> <b>velocity,</b> the 5.7×28mm also exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{are incorporated into}} eruption columns as they are ejected from the vent at <b>high</b> <b>velocity.</b> The initial momentum from the eruption propels the column upwards. As air is drawn into the column, the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise buoyantly into the atmosphere. At {{a point where the}} bulk density of the column {{is the same as the}} surrounding atmosphere, the column will cease rising and start moving laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{significant}} {{to the design}} of the P90 is the small-caliber, high-velocity bottlenecked cartridge it uses. The 5.7×28mm cartridge was created by FN Herstal in response to a NATO requirement that called for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, which is commonly used in pistols and submachine guns. The 5.7×28mm cartridge weighs 6.0g (93grains)—roughly half as much as a typical 9×19mm cartridge—allowing the same number of rounds to be carried for less weight, or allowing more rounds to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge has a relatively small diameter, an unusually high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it produces roughly 30percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability. Due to its <b>high</b> <b>velocity,</b> the 5.7×28mm exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.|$|E
30|$|In a drift-flux model, slip between phases is considered. Because of the {{non-uniform}} velocity profiles, one {{phase of}} two-phase flow is transported at a <b>higher</b> <b>velocity</b> {{than the other}} phase. For oil–gas two-phase flow, gas tends to have a <b>higher</b> <b>velocity</b> than oil; while for the water–oil flow, it depends on whether the flow pattern is O/W (oil phase dispersed in water phase) or W/O (water phase dispersed in oil phase). A dispersed phase has a <b>higher</b> <b>velocity</b> than the continuous phase. Compared to the homogeneous model, the evaluation of holdup (in situ volume fraction) of each phase in drift-flux model comes from an empirical correlation based on experiments.|$|R

5|$|The Disney bomb, by contrast, was {{designed}} {{from the start}} to penetrate the thick concrete roofs of fortified bunkers. Whereas the earthquake bomb's target was the bunker itself, the Disney bomb's target was the bunker's contents. To this end, the warhead was composed of an unusually thick steel shell containing a comparatively small amount of explosive. It was much slimmer than was usual for aircraft-dropped bombs, and a cluster of booster rockets accelerated the weapon as it fell. These features accord with Newton's approximation for impact depth and the empirical design equation known as Young's equation that states that the deepest target penetration is achieved by a projectile that is dense, long and thin (i.e. has a large sectional density), and strikes with a <b>high</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{dust in the}} gossamer rings {{originates}} in essentially {{the same way as}} that in the main ring and halo. Its sources are the inner Jovian moons Amalthea and Thebe respectively. <b>High</b> <b>velocity</b> impacts by projectiles coming from outside the Jovian system eject dust particles from their surfaces. These particles initially retain the same orbits as their moons but then gradually spiral inward by Poynting–Robertson drag. The thickness of the gossamer rings is determined by vertical excursions of the moons due to their nonzero orbital inclinations. This hypothesis naturally explains almost all observable properties of the rings: rectangular cross-section, decrease of thickness in the direction of Jupiter and brightening of the top and bottom edges of the rings.|$|E
5|$|WASP-43 is a K-type {{star in the}} Sextans constellation. It {{is about}} {{half the size of}} the Sun, and has {{approximately}} half the mass. WASP-43 has one known planet in orbit, a Hot Jupiter called WASP-43b. At the time of publishing of WASP-43b's discovery on April 15, 2011, the planet was the most closely orbiting Hot Jupiter discovered. The small orbit of WASP-43b is thought to be caused by WASP-43's unusually low mass. WASP-43 was first observed between January and May 2009 by the SuperWASP project, and was found to be cooler and slightly richer in metals than the Sun. WASP-43 has also been found to be an active star that rotates at a <b>high</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|E

5|$|The dust is {{constantly}} being {{removed from the}} main ring {{by a combination of}} Poynting–Robertson drag and electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. Volatile materials, for example ices, evaporate quickly. The lifetime of dust particles in the ring is from 100 to 1000years, so the dust must be continuously replenished in the collisions between large bodies with sizes from 1cm to 0.5km and between the same large bodies and <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> particles coming from outside the Jovian system. This parent body population is confined to the narrow—about 1000km—and bright outer part of the main ring, and includes Metis and Adrastea. The largest parent bodies must be less than 0.5km in size. The upper limit on their size was obtained by New Horizons spacecraft. The previous upper limit, obtained from HST and Cassini observations, was near 4km. The dust produced in collisions retains approximately the same orbital elements as the parent bodies and slowly spirals in the direction of Jupiter forming the faint (in back-scattered light) innermost part of the main ring and halo ring. The age of the main ring is currently unknown, but it may be the last remnant of a past population of small bodies near Jupiter.|$|E
