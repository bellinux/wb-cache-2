5|$|The head {{should be}} of {{moderate}} width at the ears, narrowing to the eyes, and slightly flat between the ears. There should be a defined but not overpronounced stop {{at the end of}} the muzzle where it meets the head, and a black nose. The jaw should be powerful and well boned with a scissor bite and straight teeth. The eyes are almond shaped and dark coloured and should be full of life and intelligence. Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head. When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five inches in order to provide a sufficient <b>hand-hold</b> for gripping the terrier.|$|E

Even in deliberate illuminations, it is hard to <b>hand-hold</b> a laser on a moving target, so there will be a series of longer flashes. With helicopters at close range, it is possible to have a more or less continuous light. The flashes shown greatly exaggerate the duration of a laser flash and use green rather than less visible red light. [...] With a plane traveling hundreds of miles/hour and a laser beam size of only a meter or so, flash durations would be measured in thousandths of a second.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{handedness}} is {{the topic}} of many psychological research articles. One such article presented the information that over 10% of the world's population is left handed. A 1997 archaeological research project, led by Laura Phillipson, analyzed about 250 Kariandusi handaxes for signs of handedness. From the 250 samples, Phillipson's team narrowed the number down to the 54 handaxes that {{appeared to have been}} used the least, and with the least amount of wear on the edges. In order {{to determine whether or not}} a handaxe was left-handed or right-handed, the team analyzed the <b>hand-hold</b> spots on each specimen. Based on how comfortable a handaxe was to hold in either the left or right, 6 of the samples were proved to be left-handed. The full results of the research are as follows: ...|$|E
60|$|As I came {{sputtering}} to {{the surface}} I looked about for some tiny foot- or <b>hand-hold</b> where I might cling {{for a moment of}} rest and recuperation. The cliff itself offered me nothing, so I swam toward the mouth of the fiord.|$|E
60|$|Feeling {{moderately}} {{sure that}} this was the animal his uncle had seen, and that the deer would not go far, but might even come back out of curiosity, Earl began to climb the cliff. A profusion of brush grew among the rocks, and these afforded him a good <b>hand-hold,</b> and he was soon at the top.|$|E
50|$|ISIRI 8319 is a {{standard}} published by the Institute of Standards and Industrial Research of Iran (ISIRI) in January 2006 based on Directive 93/32/EEC and Directive 99/24/EC. It defines passenger <b>hand-holds</b> on two-wheel motor vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Heterosexual public {{displays}} of affection are frowned upon in Thai culture. However, minor {{displays of}} affection, such as <b>hand-holding,</b> between same sex individuals is considered the norm. In this way tom-dee partnerships can be invisible to the wider society.|$|R
50|$|The Training was {{designed}} for a three-day period to quickly equip the volunteer community counselors with the basic skills of counseling. Thereafter additional support and <b>hand-holding</b> was provided through fortnightly follow up half-day sessions over a three-month period that was participatory and interactive.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, I insisted, {{and now we}} were {{thankful for}} the coupled lariats. They could not lower them {{directly}} toward me because of a tree, and when the end lay resting on the snow several yards away I braced myself to attempt the risky traverse. The slope was pitched as steeply as the average roof, and there was ice beneath the frost-dried powder that slid along it. Leaving the rifle behind, I drove the long blade of my knife deep down for a <b>hand-hold</b> before the first move.|$|E
60|$|Surprised and enraged, {{the bull}} {{clutched}} madly for support as he toppled sidewise, {{and then with}} an agile movement succeeded in projecting himself toward another limb a few feet below. Here he found a <b>hand-hold,</b> quickly righted himself, and as quickly clambered upward to be revenged upon Tarzan, but the ape-man was otherwise engaged and {{did not wish to}} be interrupted. He was explaining again to Taug the depths of the latter's abysmal ignorance, and pointing out how much greater and mightier was Tarzan of the Apes than Taug or any other ape.|$|E
6000|$|... 197. Now was {{the word}} of the gospel forced from my soul, so that no promise or {{encouragement}} was {{to be found in the}} Bible for me; and now would that saying work upon my spirit to afflict me, [...] "Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy as other people" [...] (Hosea 9:1). For I saw indeed there was cause of rejoicing for those that held to Jesus; but as for me, I had cut myself off by my transgressions, and left myself neither foot-hold, nor <b>hand-hold,</b> amongst all the stays and props in the precious word of life.|$|E

50|$|The falls are {{bordered by}} lush, green {{vegetation}} that shades {{the area from}} the sun and keeps the area, and climbers, cool. The climb can be relatively hard so is often undertaken as a <b>hand-holding</b> human chain led by a guide to make it easier.|$|R

60|$|As Tarzan swung rapidly {{through the}} trees, little Tibo {{closed his eyes}} in terror rather than look longer down into the frightful abysses beneath. Never before in all his life had Tibo been so frightened, yet as the white giant sped on with him through the forest there stole over the child an inexplicable {{sensation}} of security as he saw how true were the leaps of the ape-man, how unerring his grasp upon the swaying limbs which gave him <b>hand-hold,</b> and then, too, there was safety in the middle terraces of the forest, far above {{the reach of the}} dreaded lions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Man overboard!" [...] cried Daggoo, who {{amid the}} general consternation {{first came to}} his senses. [...] "Swing the bucket this way!" [...] and putting one foot into it, so as the better to secure his {{slippery}} <b>hand-hold</b> on the whip itself the hoisters ran him high {{up to the top}} of the head, almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea, as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed that}} Lucy located the gun without turning her {{eyes away from}} Joel's. She {{gathered}} all her force--rolled over swiftly--again--got {{her hands on the}} gun just as Creech leaped like a panther upon her. His weight crushed her flat--his strength made her <b>hand-hold</b> like that of a child. He threw the gun aside. Lucy lay face down, unable to move her body while he stood over her. Then he struck her, not a stunning blow, but just the hard rap a cruel rider gives to a horse that wants its own way. Under that blow Lucy's spirit rose to a height of terrible passion. Still she did not lose her cunning; the blow increased it. That blow showed Joel to be crazy. She might outwit a crazy man, where a man merely wicked might master her.|$|E

5|$|The big {{dance was}} the film's most {{sustained}} and elaborate sequence, so two cameras were used, with frequent recourse to <b>hand-holding</b> and telephoto zooming in order both {{to sustain the}} documentary-style look and feel and to take pressure off the performers, who were not always sure whether they were being included in the shots.|$|R
60|$|The Bisse of Leysin is one {{of those}} {{artificial}} water-courses which bring water from some distant source to pastures that have an insufficient or uncertain supply. It is a little better known than most because of a certain exceptional boldness in its construction; for a distance of a few score yards it runs supported by iron staples across the front of a sheer precipice, and for perhaps half a mile it hangs like an eyebrow over nearly or quite vertical walls of pine-set rock. Beside it, on the outer side of it, runs a path, which becomes an offhand gangway of planking at the overhanging places. At one corner, which gives the favourite picture postcard from Montana, the rocks project so sharply above the water that the passenger on the gangway must crouch down upon the bending plank as he walks. There is no <b>hand-hold</b> at all.|$|E
60|$|And {{the train}} is going fast--faster than any train I have ever tackled. As the last coach comes by I sprint in the same {{direction}} with it. It is a swift, short sprint. I cannot hope to equal the speed of the train, but I can reduce the difference of our speed to the minimum, and, hence, reduce the shock of impact, when I leap on board. In the fleeting instant of darkness I do not see the iron hand-rail of the last platform; nor is there time for me to locate it. I reach for where I think it ought to be, and at the same instant my feet leave the ground. It is all in the toss. The next moment I may be rolling in the gravel with broken ribs, or arms, or head. But my fingers grip the <b>hand-hold,</b> there is a jerk on my arms that slightly pivots my body, and my feet land on the steps with sharp violence.|$|E
60|$|The Misi {{had been}} holding, but the added windage of the Cactus was too much, and the {{entangled}} schooners slid away across the boiling white. Their men {{could be seen}} chopping and fighting to get them apart. The Roberta, cleared of her anchors, with a patch of tarpaulin set for'ard, was heading for the passage at the northwestern end of the lagoon. They saw her make it and drive out to sea. But the Misi and Cactus, unable to get clear of each other, went ashore on the atoll {{half a mile from}} the passage. The wind merely increased on itself and continued to increase. To face the full blast of it required all one's strength, and several minutes of crawling on deck against it tired a man to exhaustion. Hermann, with his Kanakas, plodded steadily, lashing and making secure, putting ever more gaskets on the sails. The wind ripped and tore their thin undershirts from their backs. They moved slowly, as if their bodies weighed tons, never releasing a <b>hand-hold</b> until another had been secured. Loose ends of rope stood out stiffly horizontal, and, when a whipping gave, the loose end frazzled and blew away.|$|E

50|$|The {{increase}} in long-distance relationships {{is matched by}} {{an increasing number of}} technologies designed specifically to support intimate couples living apart. In particular there have been a host of devices which have attempted to mimic co-located behaviours at a distance including <b>hand-holding,</b> leaving love notes, hugging and even kissing. The success of these technologies has, so far, been limited.|$|R
60|$|Very {{soon after}} I came {{to where the}} stream {{collects}} in another banana swamp, with the bananas bearing well. Beyond, the course is again quite dry; it mounts with a sharp turn a very steep face of the mountain, and then stops abruptly at the lip of a plateau, I suppose the top of Vaea mountain: plainly no more springs here--there was no smallest furrow of a watercourse beyond--and my task might {{be said to be}} accomplished. But such is the animated spirit in the service that the whole advance guard expressed a sentiment of disappointment that an exploration, so far successfully conducted, should come to a stop in the most promising view of fresh successes. And though unprovided either with compass or cutlass, it was determined to push some way along the plateau, marking our direction by the laborious process of bending down, sitting upon, and thus breaking the wild cocoanut trees. This was the less regretted by all from a delightful discovery made of a huge banyan growing here in the bush, with flying-buttressed flying buttresses, and huge arcs of trunk hanging high overhead and trailing down new complications of root. I climbed some way up what seemed the original beginning; it was easier to climb than a ship's rigging, even rattled; everywhere there was foot-hold and <b>hand-hold.</b> It was judged wise to return and rally the main body, who had now been left alone for perhaps forty minutes in the bush.|$|E
60|$|The train started slowly, but {{gathered}} speed {{sooner than}} I had expected. The flaring lights drew swiftly near. The rattle {{grew into a}} roar. The dark mass hung for a second above me. The engine-driver silhouetted against his furnace glow, the black profile of the engine, the clouds of steam rushed past. Then I hurled myself on the trucks, clutched at something, missed, clutched again, missed again, grasped some sort of <b>hand-hold,</b> was swung off my feet--my toes bumping on the line, and with a struggle seated myself on the couplings of the fifth truck {{from the front of}} the train. It was a goods train, and the trucks were full of sacks, soft sacks covered with coal dust. I crawled on top and burrowed in among them. In five minutes I was completely buried. The sacks were warm and comfortable. Perhaps the engine-driver had seen me rush up to the train and would give the alarm at the next station: on the other hand, perhaps not. Where was the train going to? Where would it be unloaded? Would it be searched? Was it on the Delagoa Bay line? What should I do in the morning? Ah, never mind that. Sufficient for the day was the luck thereof. Fresh plans for fresh contingencies. I resolved to sleep, nor can I imagine a more pleasing lullaby than the clatter of the train that carries you at twenty miles an hour away from the enemy's capital.|$|E

50|$|There {{exists a}} {{difference}} of opinion on the use of child harnesses. Some adults disapprove of the use of child harnesses. In some cases, the disapproval is because the critic does not have any personal experience with a young child who is unusually impulsive or has invisible disabilities that can cause a child to run away. Those in favor argue for the benefit of enhanced safety, and increased freedom of movement compared to <b>hand-holding</b> or confinement of children to strollers. In other cases, parents who are experienced with children with any number of special needs find the practice of leashing children repugnant, as if a parent can simply look away and depend upon a restraining system rather than giving a child a child's due. Those opposed to their use prefer restraining children through <b>hand-holding,</b> confinement to strollers, or not permitting children who behave badly or wander away to leave their homes.|$|R
