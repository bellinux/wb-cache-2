5000|$|Disk {{units are}} {{identified}} as Models A2, A2F, B2, B2F, C2, and C2F with each model containing two HDAs. The models are installed in strings of units with an A2 or A2F unit required and attached to a storage control such as the IBM 3830 Model 2 or the equivalent <b>integrated</b> <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> of a system unit. After the A2 can be up to 3 B2 units or up to 2 B2s and a C2. The C2 unit also connects to a storage control {{and serves as a}} secondary path to itself and the A2 and B2 units. When using a C2 two I/O operations could simultaneously take place on the string, one via an A2 and a second via the C2. The valid 3350 strings are: -A, -AB, -ABB, -ABBB, -AC-, -ABC-, or -ABBC- configurations.|$|E

An <b>integrated</b> energy <b>storage</b> and <b>control</b> module (18) includes an energy storage (20) to store electrical energy. A transducer (22) converts the stored energy into a form that is suitable for supply to the machine. The module is coupled to the machine via an energy connection (26). A control circuit (24) adjusts electrical power for supply to the machine, where the power is stored in the energy storage, drawn through conversion by the transducer and provided at the connection. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for upgrading motor vehicle provided with {{an electric}} drive and operated by an internal combustion motor vehicle. USE - Upgrading kit for upgrading a motor vehicle operated with an internal combustion engine, to a hybrid vehicle. ADVANTAGE - The kit enables upgrading {{of the motor vehicle}} for the purpose of consumption reduction and/or increase of driving pleasure and driving safety, in a cost-effective and non-complex manner with respect to installations. The kit is safe to use against faulty installations...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{predictability}} {{and availability}} at large scale, wave energy conversion (WEC) {{has still not}} become a mainstream renewable energy technology. One {{of the main reasons}} is the large variations in the extracted power which could lead to instabilities in the power grid. In addition, maintaining the speed of the turbine within optimal range under changing wave conditions is another control challenge, especially in oscillating water column (OWC) type WEC systems. As a solution to the first issue, this paper proposes the direct connection of a battery bank into the dc-link of the back-to-back power converter system, thereby smoothening the power delivered to the grid. For the second issue, model predictive controllers (MPCs) are developed for the rectifier and the inverter of the back-to-back converter system aiming to maintain the turbine speed within its optimum range. In addition, MPC controllers are designed to control the battery current as well, in both charging and discharging conditions. Operations of the proposed battery direct integration scheme and control solutions are verified through computer simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed <b>integrated</b> energy <b>storage</b> and <b>control</b> solutions are capable of delivering smooth power to the grid while maintaining the turbine speed within its optimum range under varying wave conditions...|$|R
50|$|In {{nonsynchronous}} operation, {{the transfer}} of data between the channel and the <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> is not synchronized with {{the transfer of}} data between the <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> and the device. Channel programs can be executed such that channel and <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> activities required to end execution of one command and advance to the next {{do not have to}} occur during the inter-record gap between two adjacent fields. An intermediate buffer in the <b>storage</b> <b>control</b> allows independent operations between the channel and the device. A major advantage of ECKDs is far longer cables; depending upon application it may improve performance.|$|R
