Aiming at how {{to solve}} the problem of cheque image {{discrimination}} quickly and accurately,an automatic system <b>for</b> <b>cheque</b> discrimination by using Optical Character Recgnition (OCR) technique based on the features of a cheque image was designed and developed, the main functional modules and key technologies of the system were studied, and all the functional modules were organized in a good logic way,finally, the automatic system <b>for</b> <b>cheque</b> discrimination was intergratted. The results of the experimental tests showed that the system can identify the information of one cheque quickly and accurate, the discrimination results were good...|$|R

The bank claims {{it was the first}} to introduce a pre-printed <b>cheque</b> <b>form,</b> prior to which customers simply wrote a letter to their bank but sent it to their creditor who presented it for payment. Its first bank note was issued in 1729.|$|R

50|$|The first ZAR {{revenues}} were numeral stamps inscribed ZEGELREGT issued in 1875. A set of 9 with values from 6d to £5 was issued, {{and it is}} imperforate. In 1876 an embossed 1d value was issued <b>for</b> <b>cheques.</b>|$|R
50|$|From the mid-1990s, many {{countries}} enacted laws to allow <b>for</b> <b>cheque</b> truncation, {{in which a}} physical cheque is converted into electronic form for transmission to the paying bank or clearing-house. This eliminates the cumbersome physical presentation and saves time and processing costs.|$|R

40|$|Numerals are {{the written}} and read symbols for numbers. Learning to identify, {{recognize}} and write numerals {{is an important}} part of early arithmetical development. Automatic numeral recognition of a script/language has variety of applications like reading postal zip code, passport number, employee code, bank <b>cheque,</b> <b>form</b> processing and so on. This paper presents a novice approach to identify the numerals; we call it as Circle partition approach which can be used after preprocessing stage. We have made the use of a new concept for feature extraction known as vector contour. The pros and cons and limitations of our approach are also discussed...|$|R

50|$|In 1931 {{an attempt}} was made to simplify the {{international}} use of cheques by the Geneva Convention on the Unification of the Law Relating to Cheques. Many European and South American states as well as Japan joined the convention. However, countries including the US and members of the British Commonwealth did not participate and so it remained very difficult <b>for</b> <b>cheques</b> to be used across country borders.|$|R
50|$|It {{also needed}} to address the process <b>for</b> dishonoured <b>cheques,</b> as cheques {{could no longer be}} returned. A typical solution, as defined by the Monetary Authority of Singapore <b>for</b> the Singapore <b>cheque</b> {{truncation}} system, was that a special 'Image Return Document' was created and sent back to the bank that had truncated the cheque.|$|R

5000|$|The 50 krone {{banknote}} has {{the word}} [...] "femti", not [...] "halvtreds" [...] {{which is the}} usual Danish word for fifty. Femti is a word used <b>for</b> <b>cheques.</b> The Danish National bank first used it on the 50 krone banknote issued in 1957, and the 1997 banknote is thus the third to use this word. However, on the new banknote issued on 11 August 2009 the word [...] "halvtreds" [...] is used instead of [...] "femti".|$|R
5000|$|A {{certified}} check or certified <b>cheque</b> is a <b>form</b> of <b>cheque</b> <b>for</b> which the bank verifies that sufficient funds {{exist in the}} account to cover the cheque, and so certifies, {{at the time the}} cheque is written. Those funds are then set aside in the bank's internal account until the cheque is cashed or returned by the payee. Thus, a certified cheque cannot be stopped (can't [...] "bounce"), and, in this manner, its liquidity is similar to cash, barring bank failure or illegal act (such as the funds being based on a fraudulent loan, at which point the cheque will be disavowed).|$|R
50|$|In 1881 at Newport, former Lincolnshire curate John Frederick Morgan, {{after visiting}} the rector Rev.

He was allowed bail, and subsequently pleaded guilty at trial.|$|R
50|$|Wesley Weber, {{a career}} criminal, was a self-taught mastermind {{who had spent}} years {{tinkering}} with banknotes to perfect the simulated images and security features. These skills earned him a conviction <b>for</b> <b>cheque</b> forgery ring in 1997, and another for counterfeiting $10 and $20 bills since 1999. He was arrested in October 2000 for passing a counterfeit $100 at an auto parts supplier, but was released on bail a week later. He pleaded guilty in August 2001, and received a five-year prison sentence. Weber was released from jail in August 2006.|$|R
5000|$|To {{intervene}} in the [...] "business cycle", a central bank may choose {{to go into the}} open market and buy or sell government bonds, which is known as open market operations to increase reserves. Open Market Operations are when the central bank buys bonds from other banks in exchange <b>for</b> <b>cheques.</b> These local banks then cash the cheques, which allow them to take money from the central bank. This action thus decreases any credit the local banks may owe to the central bank, and also increases their money supply. This thus increases reserves.|$|R
50|$|Sharples, once {{a prosperous}} town, is so entirely {{bound up with}} the {{shipyard}} that was its major employer that when the shipyard failed, so did the town. Unemployment is very high, and few shops remain open, the entire town living on the dole. The hospital is still open, however, and Warren is operated on successfully. While recovering he learns of the town's plight, as he starts becoming attracted to the Hospital's Almoner, Alice MacMahon - a law graduate who never practised but who is fiercely loyal to her town. He continues the pose of being indigent, and watches as others die through listlessness and lack of strength. Eventually his convalescence is complete and he is discharged. By this time, he has managed to have money and <b>cheque</b> <b>forms</b> sent to him, and he gives a major gift to the hospital, keeping it quiet.|$|R

25|$|In {{the metal}} type era, type-founding {{companies}} often would offer pre-formed illustrations as fonts showing objects and designs {{likely to be}} useful for printing and advertisements, the equivalent of modern clip art and stock photographs. As examples, the American Type Founders specimen of 1897 offered designs including baseball players, animals, Christmas wreaths, designs <b>for</b> <b>cheques,</b> and emblems such as state seals for government printing. The practice has declined as printing custom illustrations and colour printing using processes such as lithography has become cheaper, although illustration typefaces are still sold by some companies.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{non-cash}} payment methods used in Romania against other European Union countries {{to stress the}} main differences of {{the latest developments in}} this specific area since the crisis errupted up to present. In Romania, the most common payment method is transfer credit, because of its simplicity and because it is less risky than the other non-cash payment methods, while in EU direct debit and credit cards are more common. However, the value per transaction for any type of non-cash instruments (except <b>for</b> <b>cheques)</b> is smaller in Romania than in other EU countries...|$|R
