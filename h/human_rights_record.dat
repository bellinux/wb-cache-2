Other issues, such as Kurdish rights, women's rights, LGBT rights, and press freedom, have also attracted controversy.

To date, the activities of the NSHR have been limited and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence. Saudi Arabia was one of only eight countries that did not accept the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights when it was launched in 1948. Now, only Saudi Arabia remains openly opposed to the declaration. In response to the continuing criticism of its <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>record,</b> the Saudi government points to the special Islamic character of the country, and asserts that this justifies a different social and political order.|$|E
40|$|What makes a <b>record</b> a "human <b>rights</b> record"? What {{types of}} records fall under this {{umbrella}} term? How and why might we develop a typology of such records? What is at stake—ethically, theoretically, and practically—in {{the ways in}} which and the reasons why we define and classify records as such? This article seeks to answer these questions by delineating a typology of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>records.</b> First, this article will provide a literature review exploring the history of conceptions of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>records</b> in archival studies, as well as the ongoing discussion in information studies more broadly about the politics of the organization of information. Next, this paper will outline the chosen methodology of conceptual analysis and describe the ways such methodology will be employed to de/construct the term “human <b>rights</b> <b>record.</b> ” This paper will then provide a typology of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>records,</b> positing that such records can be examined according to five interlocking vectors: who created them, why, and when, where they are currently stewarded, and how they are being put to use. This paper will then analyze two keys examples of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>records</b> using the proposed typology. Finally, this paper will conclude by examining the ethical, political, and professional implications of the proposed typology and suggest ways in which this rubric can be used in the future...|$|R
