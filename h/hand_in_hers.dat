60|$|Mrs. McCaskey {{slipped her}} arm inside her husband's {{and took his}} rough <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{took his}} <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers,</b> and holding it, nodded the word {{she could not}} speak.|$|E
60|$|The woman rushed {{forward and}} seized the ape-man's <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|R

60|$|Beatrice {{walked up}} to her, took the thin little <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers,</b> and looked her fixedly in the eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{extended}} her arms toward {{him across the}} body of the dead man, and took his <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{took his}} <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers</b> {{to keep them}} warm. The nursing habit seemed to have taken root in her.|$|R
60|$|She {{made him}} {{sit down and}} drew a low chair herself to his side. She held his <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
60|$|Her sister {{turned and}} obeyed, {{and then came}} and sat by the sofa and took the thin little <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{held his}} cold <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers</b> and {{suddenly}} raised {{it to her}} lips. Then she turned away and hurried indoors.|$|E
60|$|Instead of obeying her {{the girl}} came and knelt down by her side, taking {{one of her}} mother's {{listless}} <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... [The COMTESSE guesses, {{and takes}} both the <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers</b> {{as if she}} valued them. She pulls off MAGGIE's hat as if to prevent her flying away.] ...|$|R
60|$|The patient ceased {{talking and}} a quieter {{expression}} came over his face. Mary took his <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers</b> and quietly stroked it.|$|E

60|$|He came at once towards her. She took {{both his}} <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers,</b> she leaned towards him. She {{was a tall}} woman {{and they were very}} nearly the same height.|$|R
60|$|He {{took her}} {{luxuriant}} hair <b>in</b> both his <b>hands,</b> {{and pulled it}} outside the cloak, and fitted the collar about her neck. She caught both his <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers,</b> and looking up, laughed gleefully.|$|R

60|$|She {{took his}} <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers</b> and {{smoothed}} it. She had returned his kiss, but {{she drew a}} little further away from him.|$|E
60|$|Mistress Lambert had, in the meanwhile, {{approached}} Editha. She now {{took the}} younger woman's <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers</b> and dragged her towards the coffin.|$|E
60|$|As I {{crossed the}} {{threshold}} Stella met me. She took both my <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers</b> {{and looked at}} me in silence. All that was true and good and noble expressed itself in that look.|$|R

6000|$|... "The page {{has gone}} to bid His Grace of Wessex attend upon you here, my child," [...] said the good old Duchess, as she took Ursula's cold <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers,</b> and {{mechanically}} stroked them with her own kind, wrinkled palms.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman looked}} at him scornfully. There was no {{softening}} in her face, and yet she had taken his <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers</b> and held it.|$|E
60|$|She {{took his}} <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers</b> {{and pressed it}} against her cheek, and as he stood beside her came closer {{to him with a}} {{nestling}} movement.|$|E

6000|$|... "So it is I {{who have}} {{had to come to}} you," [...] she exclaimed, taking his <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers.</b> [...] "May I sit down and talk for a little while? I am so glad--every one is glad--that you are better." ...|$|R
6000|$|Something in {{the thought}} that was {{agreeable}} and flattering, {{brought her back to}} her seat in a gayer temper. She took her sister's <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers,</b> and clapped all four hands above her head as she looked in her sister's face laughing: ...|$|R
60|$|She hesitated as if {{struck by}} a {{deference}} she was not accustomed to. Then she took his <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>hers</b> and dragged him out a little away from Brown, whom she gave a curt nod. Again she looked Pan up and down.|$|R
