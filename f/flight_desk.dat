5000|$|Jackson {{called this}} body of work the Deadly Weapons series. In concept and style, these works straddled the worlds {{of art and design}} and drew {{inspiration}} from the cutting-edge technology of the day, such as the Rockwell B-1 Lancer, or B1 Bomber as it was commonly known. In 1984, the New York Times described the connection between the fighter jet and another of Jackson’s Deadly Weapons designs, the B1 Desk: “Like the airplane, whose wings shift in <b>flight,</b> the <b>desk</b> has parts that slide open and unfold, including a secret compartment.” ...|$|R
2500|$|On October 2, 1968, a mouse device named [...] (German for [...] "rolling ball") was {{described}} as an optional device for its SIG-100 terminal {{was developed by the}} German company Telefunken. As the name suggests and unlike Engelbart's mouse, the Telefunken model already had a ball. It was based on an earlier trackball-like device (also named [...] ) that was embedded into radar <b>flight</b> control <b>desks.</b> This trackball had been developed by a team led by Rainer Mallebrein at Telefunken [...] for the German Bundesanstalt für Flugsicherung as part of their TR86 process computer system with its SIG100-86 vector graphics terminal.|$|R
5000|$|An {{hour and}} a half before the {{departure}} of BE 548, its rostered captain, Stanley Key, was involved in a quarrel in the crew room at Heathrow's Queen's Building with a first officer named Flavell. The subject was the threatened strike, which Flavell supported and Key opposed. Both of Key's flight deck crew on BE 548 witnessed the altercation, and another bystander described Key's outburst as [...] "the most violent argument he had ever heard". Shortly afterward Key apologised to Flavell, and the matter seemed closed. Key's anti-strike views had won enemies and graffiti against him had appeared on the flight decks of BEA Tridents, including Papa India. The graffiti on Papa India's <b>flight</b> engineers' <b>desk</b> was analysed by a handwriting expert to identify who had written it, but this could not be determined. The public inquiry found that none of the graffiti had been written by crew members on BE 548 {{on the day of the}} accident.|$|R

40|$|Aircraft flight station designs have {{generally}} evolved through {{the incorporation of}} improved or modernized controls and displays. In connection with a continuing increase {{in the amount of}} information displayed, this process has produced a complex and cluttered conglomeration of knobs, switches, and electromechanical displays. The result was often high crew workload, missed signals, and misinterpreted information. Advances in electronic technology have now, however, led to new concepts in flight station design. An American aerospace company in cooperation with NASA has utilized these concepts to develop a candidate conceptual design for a 1995 flight station. The obtained Pilot's <b>Desk</b> <b>Flight</b> Station is a unique design which resembles more an operator's console than today's cockpit. Attention is given to configuration, primary flight controllers, front panel displays, flight/navigation display, approach charts and weather display, head-up display, and voice command and response systems...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{functional}} {{systems and}} crew systems were defined for a 1995 transport aircraft {{through a process}} of mission analysis, preliminary design, and evaluation in a soft mockup. This resulted in a revolutionary pilot's <b>desk</b> <b>flight</b> station design featuring an all-electric aircraft, fly-by-wire/light flight and thrust control systems, large electronic color head-down displays, head-up displays, touch panel controls for aircraft functional systems, voice command and response systems, and air traffic control systems projected for the 1990 s. The conceptual aircraft, for which crew systems were designed, is a generic twin-engine wide-body, low-wing transport, capable of worldwide operation. The flight control system consists of conventional surfaces (some employed in unique ways) and new surfaces not used on current transports. The design will be incorporated into flight simulation facilities at NASA-Langley, NASA-Ames, and the Lockheed-Georgia Company. When interfaced with advanced air traffic control system models, the facilities will provide full-mission capability for researching issues affecting transport aircraft flight stations and crews of the 1990 s...|$|R
