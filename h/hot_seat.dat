5|$|Coyle's final trophy as Linfield {{manager was}} the Gold Cup in 1989–90. During his 15 {{years at the}} club he had amassed 10 League titles, 3 Irish Cups, 7 Gold Cups, 4 Ulster Cups, 5 County Antrim Shields, the Irish League Cup, and the Tyler Cup – 31 major honours in total.

Next into the managerial <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> was Trevor Anderson, who brought more silverware to the club during his five years in charge between 1992 and 1997, including 2 Irish League titles and 2 Irish Cups. After retiring as a player in 1996 following a one-year spell at Larne, David Jeffrey returned to the club as Anderson's assistant manager.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of drama {{techniques}} when employed to facilitate teaching and learning early years science. The focus is a lesson intervention designed {{for a group of}} children aged between four and five years old. A number of different drama techniques, such as teacher in role, <b>hot</b> <b>seating</b> and miming, were employed for the teaching of the water cycle. The techniques were implemented based on their nature and on what they can offer to young children considering their previous experiences. Before the beginning of the intervention, six children were randomly selected from the whole class, who were interviewed, aiming to identify their initial ideas in regards to the water cycle. The same children were interviewed {{after the end of the}} intervention in an attempt to identify the ways in which their initial ideas were changed. The results appear to be promising in terms of facilitating children’s scientific understanding and show an improvement in the children’s use of vocabulary in relation to the specific topic...|$|R

25|$|When the U.S. Millionaires {{syndicated}} version {{debuted in}} 2002, Fastest Finger was eliminated for the reduced episode length (30 minutes {{as opposed to}} the previous network version's length of 60 minutes). Thus, contestants immediately take the <b>Hot</b> <b>Seat,</b> each of them called in after their predecessors' games end. Contestants are required to pass a more conventional game show qualification test at auditions; however, when the U.S. Millionaire revived its primetime version for specials, it also restored the Fastest Finger round; this was done in 2004 for the Super Millionaire series which raised the top prize to $10,000,000 and in August 2009 for an eleven-night special that celebrated the U.S. version's tenth anniversary. Long after the U.S. version eliminated its Fastest Finger round, numerous other versions (including the Australian, Italian, Turkish, British, Russian, Dutch and French versions) followed suit by eliminating their respective Fastest Finger First rounds; additionally, some versions (such as the British, Dutch, French and Russian versions) have eliminated their respective Fastest Finger First rounds for special events wherein celebrities play for charity.|$|E
25|$|When the U.S. Millionaire {{introduced}} its shuffle format, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were {{replaced with a}} single podium and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able {{to walk around the}} stage. According to Vieira, the <b>Hot</b> <b>Seat</b> was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer. Also, two video screens were installed–one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernised look and feel, in order {{to take into account the}} show's transition to high-definition broadcasting, which had just come about the previous year.

25|$|In his decade-long {{pursuit of}} an elusive title, Mike Thibault {{found himself in}} the proverbial <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> to {{engineer}} a deep run. But an absence of urgency was reflected in the team's free agency approach – making small waves to pry Thompson and Cash from their respective teams – to solely ink rugged forward Mistie Mims in relief of Charles. Sticking with the status quo meant the roster was set {{so much so that the}} Sun drafted an unheralded Malian prospect. Going into the season, Thibault had assembled a deep roster that necessitated only a couple minor moves to cap the off-season process. The coach's patience paid dividends when his burgeoning core bolted to a 6–1 start highlighted by a chafed Montgomery turning the starting reins over to Hightower. Leading into the 1-month Olympic hiatus, the Sun strung together a five-win streak to improve to a league-best 15–4 mark. Following the ill-timed Games, which saw the club's Jones-Charles tandem help capture gold for Team USA, Connecticut continued to perform superbly while short-handed. They finished the season 25–9, with a better road record (13–4) than as hosts. The Sun fended off late Liberty rallies to sweep their way into a joust with the Fever in what was the team's first Conference finals since 2010's radical facelift. In the series, the Sun took themselves to the doorstep of a Finals berth after notching a decisive Game 1 rout. But building on a stirring two-point Game 2 win and a rally cry after losing Douglas, Indiana derailed the Sun's seemingly predestined trip in a 71–87 home romp, a defeat that essentially cost longtime coach Thibault his job. The lion's share of the season's fortunes came from the talented triumvirate of Lawson, Jones and league MVP Tina Charles flanked by Mims and sixth woman Montgomery carving a niche as an energy duo off the pines. Though failure was what came to mind in taking stock of the team's decade season; the Fever capturing the year's title being emblematic of that.|$|E
500|$|The format in the Play It! {{attraction}} {{was very}} {{similar to that of the}} television show that inspired it. When a show started, a [...] "Fastest Finger" [...] question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the <b>Hot</b> <b>Seat</b> for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became Phone a Complete Stranger which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theater who would find a guest to help. After the contestant's game was over, they were awarded anything from a collectible pin, to clothing, to a Millionaire CD game, to a 3-night Disney Cruise.|$|E
500|$|Unlike older {{game shows}} whose sets are or were {{designed}} to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, Millionaires set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show. The floor is made of Plexiglas beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper. Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs {{in the center of}} the stage, known as [...] "Hot Seats"; these measured [...] high, were modeled after chairs typically found in hair salons, and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to Millionaire, Vieira stated in an interview with her Millionaire predecessor on his morning talk show that the <b>Hot</b> <b>Seat</b> was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.|$|E

40|$|Chapter overview]: Chapter 7. Diagnosis and treatment: some {{elementary}} considerations by Travis Gee {{provides an}} introduction to assessment and diagnosis issues for counsellors whose role has traditionally focused on helping, assisting, and supporting {{people who may have}} varying degrees of mental health or clinical psychological issues. Following on ethics, and clinical supervision, this chapter places centre stage professional mental health issues that counsellors need to be aware of, but that have also tended to be overlooked by many mainstream and popular textbooks in the field. This chapter is of particular relevance as it is written by a clinical psychologist and statistician, and so provides a valuable introduction to these approaches in clinical care for counselling practitioners and students. This chapter builds on the previous chapters of this textbook and challenges readers to grapple with the politics of diagnosis and treatment by examining ideas of impairment that may be linked to theories of social deviance, among many other theories. Readers are encouraged to dig deeper into their cognitive abilities as they engage with the text, and to sit with the ideas and concepts shared in this chapter. We encourage continued critical thinking and reflexivity {{on the part of the}} reader, and ask that you take these ideas into discussions in groups and with colleagues. We suggest that you examine the critical social issues involved in diagnosis, as well as engage with the content and logic processes suggested by the author. These issues are of great social importance, and may place counselling professionals into political <b>hot</b> <b>seats</b> as we become more aware of how our professions are expected to police the boundaries of the 'normal' verses the 'abnormal'. As the field of counselling evolves and takes on more responsibility in the mental health arena, we are increasingly asked to become aware of what may have been the traditional domains of psychology, clinical psychology, clinical social work, and psychiatry. While the field of counselling may highlight particular clinical specialisations and approaches to client care, in the real world of practice we are asked to work collaboratively and in interdisciplinary teams with other health professionals...|$|R
