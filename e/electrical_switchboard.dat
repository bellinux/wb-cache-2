Arizona made a port visit to Balboa, Panama, in May 1936 during Fleet Problem XVII. On 8 June, Captain George A. Alexander relieved Baum as captain, and, 15 days later, Rear Admiral Claude C. Bloch relieved Pettengill. During gunnery practice on 24 July, the combustion gases from one gun of Turret II entered the gun turret, burning one crewman. The turret's sprinkling system was turned on to prevent any powder explosion, but the water leaked into the turret's <b>electrical</b> <b>switchboard</b> and started a small fire that was easily put out. Due to the navy's limited budget, the ship spent most of this period in port as a fuel-saving measure. In Fiscal Year 1936–37, the ship was anchored for 267 days; the following year it was in port for 255 days. The ship {{spent the rest of}} her career based on the West Coast or in Hawaii.|$|E

When she resumed firing, Vampire was no longer visible and Shirayuki targeted Thanet instead at a range of , firing 82 rounds at her. Yugiri opened fire at 03:38 at Thanet [...] away and both ships observed their target slowing down at 03:45. At that same time, Yugiri radioed Hashimoto that [...] "The enemy is two destroyers" [...] so she had spotted Vampire as she fled, although Yugiri lost sight of Vampire 10 minutes later. Sendai, Fubuki, Asagiri, Amagiri, Hatsuyuki and W-1 all subsequently opened fire, mostly at Thanet, although Vampire reported being under fire for a considerable time. All told, the Japanese ships fired 469 rounds at the Allied destroyers, failing to hit Vampire even once. Shirayuki reported that Thanet had sunk at 04:18 and rescued an officer and 30 ratings from the water; another officer and 11 ratings died in the battle. The Japanese did not pursue and Vampire reached Singapore at 10:00 that morning.|$|E

A coarse grayish-green high-talc rock is soapstone or steatite, used for stoves, sinks, <b>electrical</b> <b>switchboards,</b> crayons, soap, etc. It is often used for surfaces of laboratory table tops and <b>electrical</b> <b>switchboards</b> because of its resistance to heat, electricity and acids. Talc finds use as a cosmetic (talcum powder), as a lubricant, and as a filler in paper manufacture. It is used to coat the insides of inner tubes and rubber gloves during manufacture to keep the surfaces from sticking. Talc, with heavy refinement, {{has been used in}} baby powder, an astringent powder used to prevent diaper rash. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents not use baby powder because it poses a risk of respiratory problems, including breathing trouble and serious lung damage if the baby inhales it.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{energetic}} and economic comparison between electronic and thermostatic expansion valve in a centralized refrigeration plant of a supermarket. Adopting electronic expansion valves enables an appreciable energy saving, {{due to the fact}} that electronic valves allow a lower condensation pressure in systems equipped with air cooled condensers, which is adjusted to variations in outside air temperature. Furthermore, superheating at the evaporator is lower and more stable, increasing cooling capacity and decreasing refrigerant temperature at the compressor discharge (the latter assures better efficiency and lower wear and tear for the compressor). This study is supported by an experimental work where the cabinets of a supermarket, located in the northern Italy, have been equipped with both thermostatic and electronic expansion valves, alternatively activated by solenoid valves on a daily basis, in order to compare the two systems in the same environment and at similar load conditions. A campaign of measurements has been carried out that extended for several months whose results were recently presented. This allowed to build a simulation model of the application to evaluate the performance, energy and economic savings in different climates. Energetic analysis considers total electrical consumptions (compressors, fans and <b>electrical</b> <b>switchboards),</b> whose reduction with electronic valve was always accompanied by a better temperature set point maintenance inside the cabinets...|$|R

The author {{concentrates}} on dynamic spaces which are freely accessible to all, without any limitations (incl. important elements of urban space, such as shopping centres, cultural and leisure time centres, stations), and involve the values, symbols and signs of urban life. The aim of the writing is to analyse the nature, proportions and meanings of the paremic matter in the following studied sources: 1) street graffiti, i. e., the (anonymous) drawings, scribblings and writings (200 texts); 2) specific poster texts generated by the Tartu group of the international Loesje movement, which have been glued {{on the walls of}} buildings, <b>electrical</b> <b>switchboards,</b> lamp posts, etc. in Tartu since 2004 (the poster collection is available in Estonian, English and Russian at [URL] and includes 515 texts). The primary source for the current article comprises graffiti photographed by the author in Tartu since the beginning of 2011. The texts have been mainly recorded within the town centre; however, Karlova and Tähtvere districts also demonstrate a conspicuous amount of paremic graffiti. The analysis of multi-modal texts focuses on the proportion of the traditional and improvisational, local and global in the paremia. The aim of the article is to explain what kind of social status, mentality and expressiveness is contained in the texts of this specific cultural phenomenon, and what are the identities, platforms, ideas, and the social reality (concrete events) that these utterances are helping to reflect. The analysis of paremic graffiti texts as social communication applies context-centred methods which give consideration to the social context (i. e., who creates them for whom, where, when, for what reason, what is the receiver’s cultural potential to interpret the graffiti text), and also dwell upon the connection that graffiti has with other domains and other forms of art. The paremic text in graffiti often involves and supports the elements of pop-culture and helps to fulfil the human, philosophical, socio-political, self-expressive and sometimes very aggressive and protest-minded aspirations of the author of a particular graffiti text. Graffiti as a multi-modal written cultural form is open, flexible and adaptable to the surrounding reality. The paremic material is indeed conspicuous in the street art of Tartu, partly {{due to the fact that}} among graffiti artists there are many conscious, mission-oriented university and art school students whose actions are inherently carefully premeditated. The graffiti texts in Tartu make references to societal and cultural phenomena, and the memorable aphoristic form intrinsic to paremia, the poetic way of expression – harmony, rhymes – help, in some cases, to better convey the idea of graffiti...|$|R

40|$|An <b>electrical</b> <b>switchboard</b> cabinet {{is one of}} the {{essential}} pieces of equipment in an electrical distribution system running from a power plant to important facilities such as hospitals. The cabinet houses electrical devices, such as circuit breakers, busbars, and meters that are critical to continued operation of a variety of essential facilities. The cabinet is usually constructed using cold-formed steel members, steel panels, and screw and bolt connections. Methods typically used to assess the dynamic behavior of a properly anchored cabinet are experimental tests and high fidelity finite element models in which all structural elements (i. e., members and panels) are modeled using shell elements. However, these methods are time consuming and expensive, and interpretation of the results may be difficult especially for multiple cabinet arrangements. Therefore, a method to generate a simplified finite element model for the cabinet is proposed in this study. The simplified model consists of Timoshenko beam elements, shell elements, and springs and constraint equations. This model has the capability to capture the possible nonlinear behavior of the cabinet such as buckling of steel panels, failure of screw connections, and possible elastic local buckling near the ends of beam members.

40|$|Past {{earthquake}} {{events have}} shown that seismic damage to electrical power systems in commercial buildings, hospitals, and other systems such as public service facilities can cause serious economic losses as well as operational problems. A methodology for evaluation of the seismic vulnerability of electrical power systems is needed and all essential components of the system must be included. A key system component is the switchboard cabinet which houses many different elements which control and monitor electrical power usage and distribution within a building. Switchboard cabinets vary in size and complexity and are manufactured {{by a number of}} different suppliers; a typical cabinet design was chosen for detailed evaluation in this investigation. 	This study presents a comprehensive framework for the evaluation of the seismic performance of <b>electrical</b> <b>switchboard</b> cabinets. This framework begins with the introduction and description of the essential equipment in building electrical power systems and explains possible seismic damage to this equipment. The shortcomings of previous studies are highlighted and advanced finite element models are developed to aid in their vulnerability estimation. Unlike previous research in this area, this study proposes practical, computationally efficient, and versatile numerical models, which can capture the critical nonlinear behavior of switchboard cabinets subjected to seismic excitations. A major goal of the current study was the development of nonlinear numerical models that can accommodate various support boundary conditions ranging from fixed, elasto-plastic to free. 	Using both linear and nonlinear dynamic analyses, this study presents an enhanced evaluation of the seismic behavior of switchboard cabinets. First the dynamic characteristics of switchboard cabinets are determined and then their seismic performance is assessed through nonlinear time history analysis using an expanded suite of ground motions. The seismic responses and associated ground motions are described and analyzed using probabilistic seismic demand models (PSDMs). Based on the PSDMs, the effectiveness and practicality of common intensity measures are discussed for different components. Correlation of intensity measures and seismic responses are then estimated for each component, and their seismic performance and uncertainties are quantified in terms of engineering demand parameters. The results of this study are intended for use in the seismic vulnerability assessment of essential electrical equipment in order to achieve more reliable electrical power systems resulting in reduced overall risk of both physical and operational failures of this important class of nonstructural components.

40|$|A presente Dissertação de Mestrado tem como objetivo analisar os consumos energéticos numa instalação agropecuária, mais concretamente um aviário. O presente estudo segue a sequência do que já foi estudado por diversos autores, salientando que ao longo dos anos, este tipo de instalações tem sofrido enormes alterações, tanto a nível das tecnologias usadas nas instalações como a nível do conhecimento da genética das aves. Estes dois fatores fazem com que a análise energética deste tipo de instalações apresente resultados díspares de estudos realizados há alguns anos. Neste estudo pretende-se também avaliar a influência da temperatura {{exterior}} nos consumos energéticos da instalação. Normalmente, a análise aos consumos energéticos é feita com base nos custos reais faturados, tanto de energia elétrica como de térmica. Neste caso, optou-se por uma monitorização dos consumos de energia elétrica e tempo de funcionamento da caldeira, ao minuto, levada a cabo por equipamentos de medida instalados no aviário. Portanto, elaborou-se uma metodologia de cálculo para a obtenção da energia térmica consumida pela instalação com base no intervalo de tempo que a caldeira se encontrou parada. Para uma análise da energia térmica mais precisa, determinou-se experimentalmente o poder calorífico dos combustíveis tipicamente utilizados na instalação alvo de estudo. No que toca ao consumo de energia elétrica na instalação, o estudo foi realizado segundo medições efetuadas pelo medidor de energia instalado no quadro elétrico geral da instalação e segundo uma análise das faturas de eletricidade. Foram realizadas duas medições para a análise da energia térmica, uma em maio/junho e outra em junho/julho. Na medição de maio/junho a caldeira funcionou durante 106 horas, registando-se uma temperatura média exterior de 15 °C, enquanto na medição junho/julho a temperatura média registada foi na ordem dos 23 °C, e a caldeira funcionou, aproximadamente, 30 horas. No período de análise, os resultados obtidos a partir das medições realizadas, permitiram constatar que o consumo de energia elétrica, num ciclo de criação com 30000 aves, foi, aproximadamente, de 5000 kWh e o consumo de energia térmica foi cerca de 10000 kWh. Em relação ao consumo específico observou-se que no caso da energia elétrica, consumiu-se 3. 383 × 10 - 5 tep/ave, enquanto de biomassa, foi consumido 3. 6 × 10 - 5 tep/ave. This Master’s thesis aims {{to analyze}} the energy consumption in livestock facility, {{in this particular case}} a poultry farm. This study follows the sequence of what have already been studied by several authors, underlining that over the years, this kind of production has undergone many changes, both in terms of technologies used in the facilities and the level of knowledge about the genetics of the birds. These two factors influences the energetic analysis of this kind of installation and it represents a huge contribution to explain the difference between the results obtained in this study, compared with studies conducted a few years ago. Besides, this study aims to evaluate the influence of the outside temperatures on the energetic consumption. Usually, the analysis of energy consumption is made based on the actual billed cost, as much electric energy as thermal energy. In this case, we opted for the monitoring of electricity consumption and boiler operating time, minute by minute, carried out by measuring equipment installed in the poultry farm. In order to obtain the thermal energy consumed by the installation a methodology has been created based in the time interval that the boiler was stopped. To achieve a more accurate analysis of the thermal energy, experimental testing was carried out to get the heating value of fuel typically used in the installation of study. In what concerns the consumption of electric energy in the farm, the study was carried out following measurements in the <b>electrical</b> <b>switchboard</b> of the installation and analyzing the electricity bills. Two measurements were carried out in order to analyse the thermal energy, one in May/June and another one in June/July. During the first measurement (in May/June) the boiler worked for 106 hours, while the average temperature outside was 15 ºC, while during the second measurement (in June/July) the average temperature outside was about 23 ºC and the boiler worked for approximately 30 hours. During this period of analysis the results obtained by the measurements carried out lead to conclude that: the consumption of electric energy was approximately 5000 kWhand the consumption of thermal energy was about 10000 kWh. Concerning the specific consumption we concluded that electric energy we spent is 3. 383 × 10 - 5 toe per bird, while biomass we spent 3. 6 × 10 - 5 toe per bird. Keywords Analysis o...|$|E
