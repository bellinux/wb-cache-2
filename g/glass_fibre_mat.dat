Majorly it is used in the fields of aerospace and automobiles especially in defense use. Though, manufacturing of these of these laminates are easy to their required shapes but obtaining a drilling in the laminate poses difficulty, due to its anisotropic non homogeneous nature. The rate of rejection at the final stage due to non selection of right machining drill parameters which makes the researchers to find the optimal solution effectively.

Due to the flexible state of this stack, the sandwich panels can be produced in complex 3 D shapes, e. g. interior side of a car door. A solid panel is obtained by joining the different components through spray application of a rigid foam reaction mixture. Since the core and skin of the sandwich panel under consideration are formed in situ, they cannot be characterized in advance. Therefore different sample preparation methods and measuring techniques were developped and applied. Computed Tomography scanning and an image processing algorithm were {{used to measure the}} skin thickness. Images of multiple sandwich skins could be made in a single scan by applying an efficient sample preparation method, which considerably decreases the needed amount of time. Tensile experiments on milled skins were performed to determine the stiffness and strength properties. The compressive properties of the skins were measured through four-point bending tests. The results of these experiments demonstrated the stability of the production process.

A previous study utilising ‘single fibre’ fragmentation tests found that coating with magnesium improved the fibre and matrix interfacial shear strength. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a magnesium coating on the manufacture and characterisation of a random chopped fibre reinforced polycaprolactone composite. Short chopped strand non-woven phosphate <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>mats</b> were sputter coated with degradable magnesium to manufacture phosphate glass fibre/polycaprolactone composites. The degradation behaviour (water uptake, mass loss and pH change of the media) of these polycaprolactone composites as well as of pure polycaprolactone was investigated in phosphate buffered saline. The Mg coated fibre reinforced composites revealed less water uptake and mass loss during degradation compared to the non-coated composites. The cations released were also explored and a lower ion release profile for all three cations investigated (namely Na+, Mg 2 + and Ca 2 +) was seen for the Mg coated composite samples. An increase of 17 % in tensile strength and 47 % in tensile modulus was obtained for the Mg coated composite samples. Both flexural and tensile properties were investigated and a higher retention {{of mechanical}} properties was obtained for the Mg coated fibre reinforced composite samples up to 10 days immersion in PBS.

40|$|Random glass-mat {{thermoplastic}} (GMT) composites {{are used}} in automotive applications due to their mechanical properties and low processing cost. However, there is an inherent issue in that the thermoplastic matrices exhibit viscoelastic behaviour. In order for manufacturers to have confidence in their products, {{it is important to}} be able to predict the long-term behaviour of these materials. In this work, chopped <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>mat</b> reinforced polypropylene was studied over a stress range at room temperature. Through short-term creep experiments, a material variability of ± 18 % was determined. One day creep experiments indicated the presence of viscoplastic damage in the composite, which was verified using microscopy. The creep deformation has been modeled using a viscoelastic-viscoplastic model. To verify the model, two creep tests of 33 day duration were conducted. The test results agreed well with the model. The temperature effects and applicability of time-temperature superposition (TTS) have been investigated. Parametric studies conducted suggest that the failure modes for chopped fibre composite become matrix dominated at temperatures higher than the secondary glass transition of 60 °C. Through the development of a master curve based on 20 MPa data, it was shown that TTS is applicable to the composite. Short-term tests indicated that the material response of chopped fibre mat composites is far too random to be meaningfully quantified and this is further exacerbated at higher temperatures. From 1 day creep tests at various temperatures, it was seen that temperature appears to increase plastic strain in the material exponentially. By comparing the results from these tests to micrographs of the material, it showed that above the secondary glass transition, bulk deformation of the matrix phase in the composite is dominant due to matrix softening. Deformation of the matrix phase accelerates fibre-matrix debonding and therefore the progressive failure process. Overall, there is evidence that even for materials with inherently high property scatter, it is possible to identify the effects of nonlinearities arising from external factors using short-term creep tests on single specimens. It is, however, more difficult to develop an accurate long-term model that can account for stress and temperature conditions because of the wild experimental scatter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Blood spots {{collected}} onto {{filter paper}} are an established and convenient source of antibodies for serological diagnosis and epidemiological surveys. Although {{recommendations for the}} storage and analysis of small molecule analytes in blood spots exist, there are no published systematic studies of the stability of antibodies under different storage conditions. Methods Blood spots, on filter paper or <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>mats</b> and containing malaria-endemic plasma, were desiccated and stored at various temperatures for different times. Eluates of these spots were assayed for antibodies against two Plasmodium falciparum antigens, MSP- 1 19 and MSP 2, and calculated titres used to fit an exponential (first order kinetic) decay model. The first order rate constants (k) for each spot storage temperature were used to fit an Arrhenius equation, in order to estimate the thermal and temporal stability of antibodies in dried blood spots. The utility of blood spots for serological assays was confirmed by comparing antibodies eluted from blood spots with the equivalent plasma values {{in a series of}} samples from North Eastern Tanzania and by using blood spot-derived antibodies to estimate malaria transmission intensity in this site and for two localities in Uganda. Results Antibodies in spots on filter paper and <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> paper had similar stabilities but blood was more easily absorbed onto filter papers than <b>glass</b> <b>fibre,</b> spots were more regular and spot size was more closely correlated with blood volume for filter paper spots. Desiccated spots could be stored at or below 4 °C for extended periods, but were stable for only very limited periods at ambient temperature. When desiccated, recoveries of antibodies that are predominantly of IgG 1 or IgG 3 subclasses were similar. Recoveries of antibodies from paired samples of serum and of blood spots from Tanzania which had been suitably stored showed similar recoveries of antibodies, but spots which had been stored for extended periods at ambient humidity and temperature showed severe loss of recoveries. Estimates of malaria transmission intensity obtained from serum and from blood spots were similar, and values obtained using blood spots agreed well with entomologically determined values. Conclusion This study has demonstrated the suitability of filter paper blood spots paper for collection of serum antibodies, and provided clear guidelines for the treatment and storage of filter papers which emphasize the importance of desiccation and minimisation of time spent at ambient temperatures. A recommended protocol for collecting, storing and assaying blood spots is provided. </p...|$|R

The objectives of this investigation were: - to provide a general concept for manufacturing first polymer nanocomposites by direct intercalation during conventional twin screw extrusion-compounding process, and then nanocomposite laminates by pressure moulding; - to qualitatively and quantitatively estimate both the assessed level of particles dispersion {{and the influence of}} nano-fillers and of glass reinforcement on the material mechanical behaviour. The PP based nanocomposite was analysed by burn off test, differential scanning calorimetry and X ray diffraction. Significant micrographs were taken by optical, scanning electron and focused ion beam microscopy both on nanocomposite samples and on laminates. The NCP mechanical behaviour was evaluated by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and tensile testing. The latter was used to estimate the mechanical properties of the final laminate as well. The final material can be considered three times ‘hybrid’: halfway organic and inorganic, halfway conventional composite and exfoliated, halfway laminated and nanocomposite material.

40|$|In {{order to}} add more {{economic}} value to chicken feather, a waste material of the poultry industry, it has been researched to incorporate chicken feather fibre (CFF) into resin to produce value-added composites. In the present research, chicken feather fibre was separated from the rachises and used to produce <b>fibre</b> <b>mats.</b> Then <b>fibre</b> <b>mats</b> were incorporated into polylactic acid (PLA) to make composites with low thermal conductivity. The procedure for making chicken feather <b>fibre</b> <b>mat</b> using an automatic dynamic sheet former was explored. Two different composite fabrication methods were investigated. One involved fabricate composite samples by hot pressing chicken feather <b>fibre</b> <b>mats</b> with PLA sheet.

40|$|The {{materials}} {{under consideration}} in the present research are a glass fibre reinforced PU-foam sandwich structure and its constituents. These constituents are: a flexible open cell PU-foam, a rigid closed cell PU-foam and a continuous <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>mat.</b> The general goal {{of this research is}} to build different tools to analyse and predict the mechanical properties of the constituents and the final sandwich structure. Therefore, this research combines experimental work with numerical modelling techniques. The first part of this dissertation discusses the open cell PU-foam. Although the open cell foam is not the main load carrying material in the sandwich panel, characterizing and modelling it is of great importance in other research areas (e. g. surface functionalization or pressure drop calculations). The cellular structure of this foam is characterized by means of optical microscopy, SEM and CT. Based on the outcome of the experimental observations, the Kelvin cell and Weaire-Phelan structure were selected as RVE for the FE-modelling. Up to now, the use of the latter structure to build a FE-model has not been reported in literature. In correspondence to real foams, the material distribution in the cell edges of the RVE based FE-models is completely governed by a minimization of the surface energy. The influence of the cell size, solid PU material stiffness, relative density and shape anisotropy on the mechanical properties of the open cell foam, is investigated by means of these models. The Weaire-Phelan based FE-model proved to represent and predict the mechanical properties of the open cell foam in a better way than the standard Kelvin cell based FE-model. In order to decrease the large spread on the available data regarding the solid PU stiffness, special attention is given to this parameter. The skins of the investigated sandwich structures consist of a GF/PU-foam composite. Because the skins are formed in situ, they cannot be characterized in advance which hinders a pre-production prediction of the mechanical properties of the sandwich panel. Therefore, X-ray CT-imaging combined with image processing algorithms are used in the current study to determine the skin thickness and fibre orientation distribution function. This allows to calculate the stiffness of the skins based on the rules of mixture and the Mori-Tanaka inclusion model. The resulting data were successfully validated by experimental work. In the final part of this research the knowledge on the stiffness of PU-foam core and GF/PU-foam composite skin is joined into a simple calculation tool to predict the bending stiffness of the sandwich panels. A comparison of the calculated values to experimental stiffness data, measured on industrially produced plated, revealed an accuracy of +/- 10 %. Moreover, the influence of different parameters like the weight and orientation of the applied fibre reinforcement mats is indicated by this tool and allows to identify directions for future material developments. nrpages: 256 status: publishe...|$|E

This paper reports a study on regenerating the performance of thermally recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibres.</b> The effectiveness of the ReCoVeR treatments on the single <b>fibre</b> strength of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> thermally treated to imitate the conditions of composite recycling technology is presented. The regenerated strength levels of these ReCoVeRed fibres must be further protected and maintained by the use of fibre sizing technology similar to standard <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> products. Consequently the effect on fibre strength of the combination of the ReCoVeR treatment with a standard silane coating was also studied. Significant increase of fibre strength was obtained through the regeneration treatments, achieving greater than triple the fibre strength in comparison with the thermally treated <b>glass</b> <b>fibre.</b> Furthermore the same treatments have also been applied to <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> recovered from model composites using laboratory thermal recycling. Fibre strengths have been achieved which makes reusing these fibres as a composite reinforcement a viable option. Results on the mechanical performance of composites containing ReCoVeRed <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> are presented and discussed in support of this assertion...|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} and reuse of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> from manufacturing waste and end-of-life composites in an environmentally-friendly, cost-effective manner {{is one of}} the most important challenges facing the thermosetting polymer composites industry. A number of processes for recycling fibres from such materials are available or under development. However, nearly all options deliver recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> that are not cost-performance competitive due to the huge drop in strength of recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> compared to its original state. A breakthrough in the regeneration of recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> performance has the potential to totally transform the economics of recycling such composites. This paper reviews the available knowledge of the thermally-induced strength loss in <b>glass</b> <b>fibres,</b> discusses some of the phenomena that are potentially related and presents the status of research into processes to regenerate the strength and value of such weak recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recycled mixed {{post-consumer}} and post-industrial {{plastic wastes}} consisting of HDPE, LDPE and PP were injection moulded with short <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> (10 – 30 % by weight) {{to produce a}} new generation composite materials. Intensive experimental studies were then performed to characterise the tensile, compression and flexural properties of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced mixed plastics composites. With the addition of 30  wt. % of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre,</b> the strength properties and elastic modulus increased {{by as much as}} 141 % and 357 %, respectively. The best improvement is seen in the flexural properties due to the better orientation of the <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> in the longitudinal direction at the outer layers. The randomness and length of the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> were accounted to modify the existing rule of mixture and fibre model analysis to reliably predict the elastic and strength properties of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced mixed plastics composites.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{relationship}} between the heat capacity and the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> content in reinforced epoxy composites has been investigated. A theoretical equation linking the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> content with the heat capacity data is presented. Theoretical and the experimen-tal results are discussed. It {{has been found that}} the change in heat capacity at the glass transition temperature of the epoxy composite decreases with an increase in the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> content. The curing ex-tent of the epoxy composites also influences the heat capacity. Since the heat capacity of the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced epoxy composites can be measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry, determination of the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> content in the epoxy composite can be inferred from a study of the heat capacity data...|$|R

40|$|The present article {{demonstrates}} the recycling and {{reuse of waste}} <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> fabrics. The recycled regenerated long <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> are impregnated with polyester resin to study the mechanical performance under tensile loading conditions. The specimens are prepared from the laminates made by using vacuum assisted resin infusion technique. Therefore high quality specimens are chosen for this study. Several processing issues were identified and also evaluated the quality of specimen before the test and evaluated fracture surfaces of the tested sample to predict the failure modes. The research study includes the development of silane treatments for the recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> to regenerate the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> surface. Experiments are conducted for the reference laminate (CSM as received), Heat Treated <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> without any sizings on surface, and silane treated <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> with heat treatment. Scanned electron microscopy demonstrated {{the differences in the}} fibre surface patterns. The results demonstrate the comparison of tensile performances both at single fibre and composite levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{composites}} {{between the}} reinforced <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> wastes obtained from surfboard manufacturing industry and polypropylene were developed for value adding and environmental reasons. The thermomechanical and rheological behaviours of the composites were investigated. <b>Glass</b> <b>fibre</b> contents were varied from 5 to 30 wt%. The effects of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MA-PP) compatibilizer on the behaviours were also determined. The {{results revealed that}} the addition of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> was able to reduce the heat of fusion of the composite. Additionally, the tensile and flexural properties were increased with increasing the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> contents following the rule of mixtures. The addition of MA-PP led to enhance tensile and flexural properties due to {{the improvement of the}} adhesion between matrix and <b>glass</b> <b>fibre,</b> which is correlated with morphological observations. From the rheological studies, the apparent flow activation energy revealed that the addition of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> decreased the fluidity of the molten composite materials; however, it could be slightly improved by using MA-PP...|$|R
