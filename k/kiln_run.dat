50|$|Horst {{emigrated to}} the U.S. {{as a child in}} 1874 from Tuttlingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. In the mid 1880s he {{purchased}} a small plot of land along the Bear River, near Wheatland, California, and began cultivating hops. He soon bought out two other hop growers, Hugh Roddan and Joseph M.C. Jasper. By 1898, Horst's operation had grown to the point that ten hop drying <b>kilns</b> <b>ran</b> daily during the harvest and a company town, large enough to have its own post office, was started on the ranch to support the thousands of migrant workers who picked the mature hops each year. Given the significance of Horst's ranch, certain loamy floodplain soils found in the area were later named after him.|$|R
5000|$|A dragon kiln (...) or [...] "climbing kiln", is a {{traditional}} Chinese form of kiln, used for Chinese ceramics, especially in southern China. It is long and thin, and relies on having a fairly steep slope, typically between 10° and 16°, up which the <b>kiln</b> <b>runs.</b> The <b>kiln</b> could achieve the very high temperatures, sometimes as high as 1400 °C, necessary for high-fired wares including stoneware and porcelain, which long challenged European potters, and some examples were very large, up to 60 metres long, allowing up to 25,000 pieces to be fired at a time. By the early 12th century CE they might be over 135 metres long, allowing still larger quantities to be fired; more than 100,000 have been claimed.|$|R

50|$|The first kiln at the Coplay Cement Company was a dome kiln. Dome kilns were inefficient; {{they had}} to shut down often. In 1893 Coplay Cement built Mill B, {{containing}} the Schoefer kilns standing today. Originally enclosed in a large building, Schoefer <b>kilns</b> could <b>run</b> continuously. Soon, however, the even more efficient rotary kilns came into use. Mill B’s outdated Schoefer kilns shut down in 1904, and Coplay Cement later used Mill B’s buildings for storage.|$|R
50|$|During {{a tour of}} Europe in 1906, {{funded by}} Helen, Guerrier and her partner, Edith Brown, had an epiphany - they would return to America and develop a pottery. The {{enterprise}} would be operated by Brown, Guerrier, and the Saturday Girls, providing the young women with employment and a skill set. Helen readily agreed to subsidize the venture and the Paul Revere Pottery was born. In 1908, she purchased a large townhouse at 18 Hull Street {{to serve as the}} club’s new headquarters; the pottery and kiln were erected in the basement. The operation was wholly run by the Saturday Girls. They produced and decorated the pottery, operated the <b>kiln,</b> <b>ran</b> the store in Boston where their wares were sold and, later on, they also conducted pottery classes. Helen, Guerrier, and Brown, agreed that an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere should surround the girls. Accordingly, their rooms were always filled with “fresh flowers and bright light,” and as they worked, the young women were treated to “dramatic readings and soothing music” performed by the children of well-to-do families who patronized the pottery. They produced a wide variety of objects, including pitchers, vases, inkwells, plates, bowls, and even lamps.|$|R

50|$|The {{objective}} of kiln operation {{is to make}} clinker with the required chemical and physical properties, at the maximum rate {{that the size of}} kiln will allow, while meeting environmental standards, at the lowest possible operating cost.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the drying curves of 2 -inch thick Douglas-fir {{heartwood}} boards as predicted by a computer simulation by C. A. Hart (1983) with those actually observed in experimental <b>kiln</b> <b>runs.</b> The moisture gradients within test boards were also simulated by the computer program and actually monitored by a thermo-moisture meter constructed by J. Forrer (1984). The measurements of moisture gradients in single boards and across a stack of boards were made in a small experimental kiln and in an industrial kiln respectively using a common kiln schedule. In spite of correctable temperature effects on the monitored D. C. resistance values, Forrer's thermo-moisture meter performed well in the determination of moisture changes in different depths of test boards and in reflecting warm-up time and maximum moisture gradients. Moisture gradients in single boards or between boards in a stack, as predicted by the simulation program, came close to observed values. After adjustments of computer inputs, the simulated drying curves came into very good agreement with the actual drying curves. The same was true for moisture gradients predicted by the simulation and monitored by the thermo-moisture meter. Thus, Hart's computer simulation originally developed for and verified on white oak lumber worked for the drying of Douglas-fir heartwood lumber as well. Both the simulation program and the thermo-moisture meter appear to be excellent tools for studying the drying behavior of wood...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} successful rotary kilns {{were developed}} in Pennsylvania around 1890, based on a design by Frederick Ransome, and were about 1.5 m in diameter and 15 m in length. Such a kiln made about 20 tonnes of clinker per day. The fuel, initially, was oil, which was readily available in Pennsylvania at the time. It was particularly easy {{to get a good}} flame with this fuel. Within the next 10 years, the technique of firing by blowing in pulverized coal was developed, allowing the use of the cheapest available fuel. By 1905, the largest kilns were 2.7 x 60 m in size, and made 190 tonnes per day. At that date, after only 15 years of development, rotary kilns accounted for half of world production. Since then, the capacity of kilns has increased steadily, and the largest kilns today produce around 10,000 tonnes per day. In contrast to static kilns, the material passes through quickly: it takes from 3 hours (in some old wet process kilns) to as little as 10 minutes (in short precalciner <b>kilns).</b> Rotary <b>kilns</b> <b>run</b> 24 hours a day, and are typically stopped only for a few days {{once or twice a year}} for essential maintenance. One of the main maintenance works on rotary kilns is tyre and roller surface machining and grinding works which can be done while the kiln works in full operation at speeds up to 3.5 rpm. This is an important discipline, because heating up and cooling down are long, wasteful and damaging processes. Uninterrupted runs as long as 18 months have been achieved.|$|R
50|$|Malibu Potteries {{built its}} factory on an idyllic location, {{right next to}} the Malibu pier on the sandy beach. To be able to produce large {{quantities}} of tile, Malibu Potteries created an immense <b>kiln</b> which was <b>run</b> on diesel fuel. Their firing process required extensive use of fuel because they fired their tile at 1900° which took 24 hours and which required another full day to cool down With today's technology, there are a wide array of kilns available, especially electric kilns, that can be operated more efficiently and provide greater control.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{acquisition}} by Robert Dunning in 1924, the works were considerably expanded to provide {{supplies to the}} Midhurst Brickworks. By this time, the chalk was being extracted solely from the upper chalk pit and an overhead ropeway was constructed {{to speed up the}} transport of chalk from the chalk pit to the <b>kilns.</b> This ropeway <b>ran</b> just {{to the north of the}} later roadway with the upper [...] "terminus" [...] being situated at [...] At about this time, six new draw kilns were built, which are now the centre of the south battery.|$|R
50|$|The mined ore was roasted, or {{converted}} into an oxide, in a <b>kiln,</b> and then <b>run</b> through a chlorination process {{before it could}} be extracted. From 1882 to 1889, Garden City had several chlorination plants and formed the Garden City Chlorination Works, causing a brief period of boom. Later, the ore was treated using the cyanide process. The ore produced from the mines and mill sold for $30 per ton. However, the gold ore was not pure; it also contained trace amounts of copper, arsenic, silver, bismuth, and antimony. In 1890, a forest fire threatened Garden City, and the mine's explosives were briefly evacuated.|$|R

40|$|The present {{investigations}} have been initiated with {{the object of}} studying the air circulation and relation between • the air movement and the drying of the timber in timber seasoning kilns. The work has been divided into five separate experiments, {{each of which is}} summarised separately as follows :- Experiment 1 - The Measurement of the Flow of Air Through 'Timber Stacks. - A method of measuring the air velocity through timber stacks by means of vane anemometer p has been established. Correction factors, which, for ar 49 ne size and type of anemometer depend on the thickness of the timber and of the separating strips, on the velocity, and on the position in which the anemometer is held, have been determined for a number of cases. These have been plotted against record- ed anemometer readings on a number of graphs. Experiment 2 - The Effect of the Rate of Air Circulation on the rate of Drying. - A number of <b>kiln</b> <b>runs</b> has been made with narrow stacks of matched material using the same temperature and humidity in each run but different rates of air circulation. The object has been to determine the effect of the rate of air circulation on the rate of drying timber apart from the question of change of drying rate from one side of a wide stack to the other due to fall in temperature and increase in humidity of the air. The results indicate that with the same air conditions the rate of drying is independent of the rate of air flow provided that this rate is greater than some minimum value which is probably in most cases less -than 140 feet per minute. Experiment 3 - The Relation Between the Quantity of Air Circulate* and the La in Dr in From the Enterin to the Leaving Air Side of a Kiln Charge of Timber. - A number of tests has been carried out in an experimental kiln to determine the change in air conditions and the lag in the drying rate from the entering to the leaving air side of a stack of timber 5 feet wide. Different sized separating strips and different quantities of circulating air have been used. The theoretical relation between the quantity of air circulated, the amount of moisture evapdrated, and the change in air conditions has also been established; the results so calculated have been compared with those determined experimentally. Experiment 4 - The Relation Between Air Flow and Fall in Pressure Across a Timber Stack. - The flow of air through a rectangular duct consisting of boards and separating strips and similar to the openings through a timber stack has been investigated. Curves showing the relation between static pressure change and rate of flow have been prepared for different sized strips and for board surfaces of different degrees of roughness. Equations for the pressure loss during flow through the duct and for the entrance pressure loss have been determined. Experiment 5 - The Effect of Various Features of Kiln Design on the distribution of the Air over the Side of a Stack of Timber in a Commercial Kiln. - A series of tests has been carried out in commercial kilns of the cross shaft internal fan type to determine the effect of various distances between the kiln walls and the sides of the stack on the distribution of the circulating air {{over the side of the}} stack The results of the tests are shown diagrammatically. The conclusion:: is reached that the 16 inch wide space commonly adopted for the particular design of kiln tested is reasonably satisfactory although more comprehensive tests on an experimental kiln of commercial proportions appear desirable...|$|R

En este trabajo, se estudian programas de secado a temperaturas convencionales y la calidad de la madera seca de A. melanoxylon y A. dealbata. Experimentalmente son realizados 8 ensayos de secado a temperaturas convencionales, usando un horno de secado convectivo de 0. 3 m³ de capacidad. El diseño {{experimental}} incluye como factores variables la especie (A. melanoxylon y A. dealbata), el espesor de la madera (25 y 50 mm) y el tipo de corte (tangencial y radial). Los resultados indican que para 25 o 50 mm de espesor, la A. melanoxylon y la A. dealbata, en corte radial y tangencial se dejan secar satisfactoriamente bajo un mismo programa de temperaturas convencionales. La calidad de la madera seca se ve favorecida por la carencia de colapso y la baja anisotropía de la contracción transversal.

40|$|HF (hydrogen fluoride) {{emission}} control {{is one of}} the critical environmental parameters in the firing of ceramic materials at peak temperatures higher than 1000 °C. In this study, in-stack concentrations of HF were monitored on-line with laser-based equipment during the fast firing of ceramic tiles in continuous industrial roller hearth kilns under standard kiln operating conditions. Three different ceramic tile compositions: porous red-body wall tiles, red-body stoneware tiles, and porcelain tiles were fired in industrial kilns customarily used to manufacture these types of tiles, modifying the heating rate and tile dry bulk density. The in-stack concentrations of HF can be explained on the basis of tile HF adsorption and emission processes in the kiln preheating and firing zones, analysed in previous studies. The methodology used in this study has significant advantages for industrial studies compared with previous methodologies based primarily on laboratory-scale studies and analysis of solid material. The main advantages are: (a) rapid response, allowing abrupt changes in the HF emission to be studied; and (b) direct measurement of the in-stack concentration of HF, which is the most common parameter used as a legal limit for industrial {{emission control}}. The study shows that tile HF adsorption in the preheating zone is very important. It also shows that HF stack emissions can vary significantly in continuous kilns depending on whether glazed or unglazed tiles are produced, or important changes occur in production (such as gaps in the kiln feed). The results indicate, furthermore, that HF stack emissions do not decrease significantly when realistic changes are made in industrial operating conditions if these industrial <b>kilns</b> are <b>run</b> at peak temperatures above 1100 °C. The most important reduction in in-stack concentrations of HF is observed when glazed ceramic tiles are fired, so further research in this field can be made in order to reduce HF emissions. © 2009 Elsevier B.
