40|$|Ceramic {{membrane}} {{with unique}} morphology {{can be prepared}} using phase inversion and sintering technique. Dual layer lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) /alumina hollow fibre membrane {{in this study was}} prepared using this technique. The contributing parameters in the preparation of asymmetric alumina hollow fibre during fabrication process were investigated. The parameters involved in the process were the alumina/polyethersulfone (PESf) ratio, the internal coagulant temperature and the air-gap distance. Next, the suitable LSCF coating formulations were studied to obtain thin layer of LSCF. This was followed by the impregnations of catalyst prepared using sol-gel Pechini method. The characterizations were carried out for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-Ray spectrometry (EDX), apparent porosity, gas permeability test, <b>gas-tightness</b> <b>test,</b> Brunauer–Emmett–Teller technique, dilatometer analysis and mechanical test. The results showed that a reduction of alumina/PESf ratio from 10 to 6 resulted in the formation of asymmetric structure. The 53 weight % of alumina (AL- 53) was selected as membrane support with 1. 68 mm, 1. 08 mm and 168 µm of outside, inside diameter and finger-like length, respectively. The AL- 53 had acceptable mechanical strength of 24 MPa and high gas permeability of 13. 87 x 10 - 4 mol m- 2 Pa- 1 s- 1. The 25 weight % of LSCF membrane sintered at 1150 oC had the lowest nitrogen gas permeability of 2. 401 x 10 - 6 mol m- 2 Pa- 1 s- 1 that was considered as gas-tight LSCF layer. The dual layer LSCF/alumina hollow fibre membrane was impregnated with 10 weight % of cerium oxide doped copper oxide catalyst. This catalyst was characterized using the SEM/EDX to ensure the catalyst was placed inside the finger-like structure of alumina membrane support. The dual layer of LSCF/alumina hollow fibre membrane was successfully produced using phase inversion and sintering technique which will be beneficial for multifunctional application...|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} radiation tracker (TRT) {{is one of}} the three subsystems of the inner detector of the ATLAS experiment. It combines electron identification capability with charged-particle track reconstruction. A total of 420 000 electronic channels provide continuous tracking with many projective measurements per track. This paper gives details of some features of the TRT, from performance requirements to the consequences of its operation in the LHC environment. Some technical choices and operating conditions have been recently changed, the most significant one being the active gas. Presently, a large fraction of barrel and end-cap modules have been assembled in the United States and Russia, respectively. A strict quality assessment has been implemented at the assembly sites and at CERN upon arrival of the modules. The acceptance tests include dimensional surveys, wire- tension measurements, <b>gas-tightness</b> <b>tests,</b> high-voltage training, and gas-gain uniformity measurements along each individual straw. First estimates of the module quality are presented based on the analysis of these tests. 10 Refs...|$|R
