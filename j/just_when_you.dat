(Or, {{in the case of the}} dog, just, well, murder her.) Without her, though, the show wouldn't be half as interesting. <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> think you've seen every bit of crazy Jenny can dish out, she digs deep and finds some new neuroticism. She's fragile, but she's steel-spined when it comes to accepting responsibility for the havoc she wreaks in her life and everyone else's." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Lindsay Doran, the new {{president}} of production company Mirage Enterprises, was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the Jane Austen novel Sense and Sensibility to her colleagues. It had been adapted three times, most recently in a 1981 television serial. Doran was a longtime fan of the novel, and had vowed in her youth to adapt it if she ever entered the film industry. She chose to adapt this particular Austen work because there were two female leads. Doran stated that [...] "all of [...] books are funny and emotional, but Sense and Sensibility is the best movie story because it's full of twists and turns. <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> think you know what's going on, everything is different. It's got real suspense, but it's not a thriller. Irresistible." [...] She also praised the novel for possessing [...] "wonderful characters... three strong love stories, surprising plot twists, good jokes, relevant themes, and a heart-stopping ending." ...|$|E
500|$|Rowan Kaiser, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, gave a mixed review. While calling the case-of-the-week [...] "predictable", the {{reviewer}} also called Keith and Alicia's new relationship [...] "perhaps the most fun" [...] {{part of the}} episode. In addition, Kaiser commented on Veronica and Logan's relationship. [...] "I'm not entirely sold on the relationship, either from a character point of view or a quality point of view. Obviously it's just a kiss {{in the heat of}} the moment…but it doesn't seem to have much motivation beyond [...]" [...] IGN placed the episode 2nd in its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, second to only [...] "Leave It to Beaver". The publication praised the new Logan-Veronica dynamic and said [...] "The few episodes just before this one showed the softer, vulnerable side of Logan and <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> wonder if he's really so bad, he saves the day and an innocent peck turned into a passionate embrace." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Duel" [...] {{was written}} by Jennifer Celotta, a {{producer}} and show runner with The Office. The episode featured {{the conclusion of the}} love triangle between Dwight, Andy and Angela, a subplot that had been going on since the fourth season finale, [...] "Goodbye, Toby". The cast and writing staff saw [...] "The Duel" [...] as a defining episode for Andy Bernard because it demonstrated a softer, more emotional side of the character. Dean Holland, who directed the episode, said this was particularly effective because in past episodes, he displayed such rage problems that he had to attend anger management courses, but in [...] "The Duel" [...] he responded to horrible news in a heartrending way. Rainn Wilson particularly praised Ed Helms' performance, saying, [...] "He gives a lot of heart and soul, and Andy is such a doofus and a douche, and now you really get to see his heart break. There's some reality there. That's the great thing this show gives us, <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> think you know the characters and they're two-dimensional and they're goofy and crazy, in their own way, you get real human redemption." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Mirror Beth Neil branded {{the plot}} strand [...] "one of the darkest and most {{disturbing}} storylines EastEnders has ever attempted", with critic Jim Shelley deeming it a [...] "new low" [...] for EastEnders. Shelley wrote of Whitney's abuse: [...] "You've {{really got to}} hand it to EastEnders. <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> thought the show couldn't get any more miserable, the writers come up trumps and produce a new way of making us depressed - a paedophile storyline. Thanks for that! I realise now this is what the family meal has been missing three nights a week: gathering the telly to watch a grubby, greasyhaired thug drooling over a 15-year-old girl who (as luck would have it) spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she's not at school. And they say family entertainment's dead." [...] Shelley refuted the BBC's claims that the storyline had educational value as [...] "totally bogus", observing that [...] "At 7.30 or 8pm, the [...] "action" [...] has to be so coded as to be pointless". Deborah Orr, writing for The Independent, similarly disagreed with the BBC's statement that the storyline was part of EastEnders [...] "rich heritage of tackling difficult social issues", writing that: ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A terrific episode, with Homer so stupid it isn't true, yet still saving the day. Seeing Ned Flanders get it wrong is great, but the show-stealer is a toss-up between Borgnine's great self-deprecating role, the ironic seagull, and the dolphins." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called it a [...] "brilliant episode from start to finish". He commented that [...] "We see what an amazing amount {{of goods and services}} one can purchase in Springfield with only $20, and we get a fun spoof of scouting. Add to that terrific rivalry moments between Bart and Homer and the show excels." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict called the plot of the episode [...] "typically inspired", and gave it a grade of A. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 5 out of 5. TV DVD Reviews's Kay Daly wrote: [...] "And <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> think the Simpsons creators have taken parody as far as it can go, they air an episode like this. The writers cram the 22-minute episode with allusions to movie genres including disaster movies, Broadway musicals, adventure-suspense and classic teen horror." [...] Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it one of his ten favorite episodes of the show. He called the musical sequence a [...] "classic". Rick Porter of Zap 2 It wrote in that he was not a [...] "fan" [...] of the episode's second half: [...] "Despite the presence of Borgnine, Homer is a little too aggressively stupid for my taste". He thought the first part was [...] "absolutely brilliant", though.|$|E

2500|$|Wine Enthusiast Magazine named Clyde May's Conecuh Ridge Whiskey {{among its}} Top 50 Spirits of 2012, and its {{reviewer}} Kara Newman {{said it was}} [...] "A spry chameleon of a whiskey. At first, this dark amber spirit reads as light and sweet, from its distinct ripe apple and hazelnut notes to the light-bodied feel. But <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> think it's {{going to be a}} lightweight, there's surprising oomph on the finish, dry leather and clove notes that balance it out. This sippable whiskey would be great for whiskey sours and other cocktails. 93 points." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a good review, {{giving it a}} B overall. In her recap: [...] "There are two {{competing}} themes in this Once Upon A Time double-episode finale, and one is leagues more successful than the other. <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{get the feeling that}} OUAT can do little else but beat a dead horse forever (Hades’ blue hair! The River Of Lost Souls!), it pulls out actual insight about the duplicitousness of personality, handily personified by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, as well as the Evil Queen herself, Regina." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} illustrative metaphors {{have been used}} to {{describe}} Petrosian's style of play. Harold C. Schonberg said that [...] "playing him was like trying to put handcuffs on an eel. There was nothing to grip." [...] He {{has been described as a}} centipede lurking in the dark, a tiger looking for the opportunity to pounce, a python who slowly squeezes his victims to death, and as a crocodile who waits for hours to make a decisive strike. Boris Spassky, who succeeded Petrosian as World Chess Champion, described his style of play as such: [...] "Petrosian reminds me of a hedgehog. <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> think you have caught him, he puts out his quills." ...|$|E

D'Or composed all the songs on the album, combining world music with jazz, Thai, and Indian elements.

[...] however commented [...] "It's proof that, <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> least expect it, he can still rage compellingly." [...] Jayson Greene of The Village Voice gave a mixed review, writing [...] "when there is a firm hand reining him in, Game can still make good rap music. Left to his own devices, however, he {{produces}} a dismaying mess." [...] Chase McMullen of One Thirty BPM expressed a mixed response towards the album, stating [...] "With this mixed bag he's likely cemented {{his reputation as a}} MC that was blessed with a sack of classic beats for his debut, now just a rapper like the rest of 'em." [...] Chad Grischow of IGN wrote [...] "Fortunately, Game is on point most of the time here, delivering an excellent piece of hardened west coast rap leaving you wanting the two albums he promises before quitting rap as soon as possible." [...] Anupa Mistry of Now felt that [...] "The features wouldn’t be so bad if Game didn’t yield to the wattage and personalities of his co-stars. (Again, he can rap when he tries.) Used as a constant crutch, however, they quell his ferocity." ...|$|E
