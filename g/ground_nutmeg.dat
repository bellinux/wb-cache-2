The nutmeg {{essential oil}} {{is used as a}} natural food flavouring in baked goods, syrups, beverages (e.g. Coca-Cola), sweets etc. It replaces <b>ground</b> <b>nutmeg</b> as it leaves no particles in the food. The essential oil is also used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries for instance in tooth paste and as a major ingredient in some cough syrups. In traditional medicine nutmeg and nutmeg oil were used for illnesses related to the nervous and digestive systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} oil obtained by steam distillation of <b>ground</b> <b>nutmeg</b> is used widely in the perfumery and pharmaceutical industries. This volatile fraction typically contains 60-80% d-camphene by weight, {{as well as}} quantities of d-pinene, limonene, d-borneol, l-terpineol, geraniol, safrol, and myristicin. In its pure form, myristicin is a toxin, and consumption of excessive amounts of nutmeg can result in myristicin poisoning. The oil is colourless or light yellow, and smells and tastes of nutmeg. It {{is used as a}} natural food flavouring in baked goods, syrups, beverages, and sweets. It is used to replace <b>ground</b> <b>nutmeg,</b> as it leaves no particles in the food.

5000|$|After {{extraction}} {{of the essential}} oil, the remaining seed, containing much less flavour, is called [...] "spent". Spent is often mixed in industrial mills with pure nutmeg to facilitate the milling process, as nutmeg {{is not easy to}} mill due to the high percentage of oil in the pure seed. <b>Ground</b> <b>nutmeg</b> with a variable percentage of spent (around 10% w/w) is also less likely to clot.|$|E
50|$|In low doses, nutmeg {{produces}} no noticeable physiological or neurological response, but {{in large}} doses, raw nutmeg has psychoactive effects deriving from anticholinergic-like hallucinogenic mechanisms attributed to myristicin and elemicin. Myristicin, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and psychoactive substance, can induce convulsions, palpitations, nausea, eventual dehydration, and generalized body pain. For these reasons in some countries, whole or <b>ground</b> <b>nutmeg</b> may have import restrictions except in spice mixtures containing less than 20 percent nutmeg.|$|E
50|$|The {{isolation}} of trimyristin from powdered nutmeg {{is a common}} introductory-level college organic chemistry experiment. It is an uncommonly simple natural product extraction because nutmeg oil generally consists of over eighty percent trimyristin. Trimyristin makes up between 20-25% of the overall mass of dried, <b>ground</b> <b>nutmeg.</b> Separation is generally carried out by steam distillation and purification uses extraction from ether followed by distillation or rotary evaporation to remove the volatile solvent. The extraction of trimyristin can also be done with diethyl ether at room temperature, due to its high solubility in the ether. The experiment is frequently included in curricula, both for its relative ease and to provide instruction in these techniques.|$|E

50|$|A tie to France {{is part of}} {{the very}} concept of New Orleans Creole. The city had come into the United States when Jefferson made the Louisiana Purchase in 1803—over a hundred years after its founding. It {{remained}} an American center for French culture, tradition, and immigration into the twentieth century. The velouté is one of the 'mother' sauces, foundational in French cuisine. New Orleans took from France, but also began to impart its own spin. The traditional seasoning in the French version would be diced onions (sauteed briefly), salt, white pepper, and a pinch of <b>ground</b> <b>nutmeg.</b> A bouquet garni consisting of parsley, bay leaf, and thyme may {{have been added to the}} shrimp stock. New Orleans chefs would have added more onion, a bit of garlic, and a pinch of cayenne pepper (or a splash of hot sauce) in addition to the white pepper, producing a spicier version compared to the classic. Not the tongue searing hotness that came out of the caricature of Cajun food in the 1980s, but rather a piquant that added interest.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a {{detailed}} review of myristicin is reported. Numerous literatures report that myristicin {{is responsible for}} hallucinogenic effects, which induced by the consumption of nutmeg due to its metabolism structure of 3 -methoxy- 4, 5 -methylendioxyamphetamine (MMDA). Minimum dosage of nutmeg that can cause psychogenic effect is 5 g (<b>ground</b> <b>nutmeg)</b> with 1 to 2 mg myristicin content and this dosage is considered as ‘toxic dose’. At higher dosage of myristicin death may occur. Additionally, Myristicin poisoning can lead to many health problems that related to brain problem. Those symptoms usually occur 3 to 6 hours after ingestion of myristicin or foodstuffs containing it, and effects may persist up to 72 hours. California Poison Control System (CPCS) electronic database 72. 3 % exposures between 1997 and 2008 that were intentional for recreational purposes (between ages 13 and 20 years old). The remaining considered as unintentionally exposed. Between 1998 to 2008, Texas Poison Center Network (TPCN) received seventeen nutmeg poisoning and 64. 7 % from that cases involved abuse, and the rest was unintentional exposure. Most of the nutmeg exposures were via the oral route and minor cases of nutmeg exposure occurred through insufflated nutmeg, unintentional dermal and ocular exposures. Nutmeg also has been misused by mixing it with other drugs {{in order to get}} “high”. For intoxication cases, treatments like decontamination (cathartic, charcoal, dilution, fresh air, IV fluids) and supportive care (benzodiazepines) will be provided to reduce the effects...|$|E

Methods: Alkaloids were extracted from <b>ground</b> <b>nutmeg</b> seed kernels with 10 % acetic acid in 95 % ethyl alcohol. Visceral pain was induced in {{male and female}} BALB/c mice by intraperitoneal injection of 0. 6 % acetic acid. Analgesic effect of alkaloids (0. 5 gram or 1 gram per kilogram [g/kg], by mouth) was assessed by evaluating writhing response. Acute toxicity was tested in response to 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 g/kg of alkaloid extract; the median lethal dose (LD 50) was determined by probit analysis. Results: Alkaloid extract at a dose of 1 g/kg significantly {{reduced the number of}} writhing responses in female, but not male mice; 0. 5 g/kg of alkaloid extract had no effect in either sex. The LD 50 was 5. 1 g/kg. Signs of abnormal behavior, including hypoactivity, unstable gait, and dizziness were seen in animals given a dose of 4 g/kg or higher; abnormal behavior lasted for several hours after administration of the alkaloids. Conclusion: According to the classification of Loomis and Hayes, M. fragrans seed alkaloids have analgesic activity and are slightly toxic.

50|$|In Poland {{and other}} parts of eastern Europe and Scandinavia, fish often is used for the {{traditional}} main course, but richer meat such as lamb is increasingly served. In Sweden it is common with a special variety of smörgåsbord, where ham, meatballs and herring play a prominent role. In Germany, France, and Austria, goose and pork are favored. Beef, ham, and chicken in various recipes are popular throughout the world. The Maltese traditionally serve Imbuljuta tal-Qastan, a chocolate and chestnuts beverage, after Midnight Mass and throughout the Christmas season. Slovaks prepare the traditional Christmas bread potica, bûche de Noël in France, panettone in Italy, and elaborate tarts and cakes. The eating of sweets and chocolates has become popular worldwide, and sweeter Christmas delicacies include the German stollen, marzipan cake or candy, and Jamaican rum fruit cake. As one of the few fruits traditionally available to northern countries in winter, oranges have been long associated with special Christmas foods. Eggnog is a sweetened dairy-based beverage traditionally made with milk, cream, sugar, and whipped eggs (which gives it a frothy texture). Spirits such as brandy, rum or bourbon are often added. The finished serving is often garnished with a sprinkling of <b>ground</b> cinnamon or <b>nutmeg.</b>|$|R
