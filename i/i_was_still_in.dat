500|$|Pound {{arrived in}} Naples in July 1958, {{where he was}} photographed giving a fascist salute to the waiting press. When asked {{when he had been}} {{released}} from the mental hospital, he replied: [...] "I never was. When I left the hospital <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> America, and all America is an insane asylum." [...] He and Dorothy went to live with Mary at Castle Brunnenburg, near Merano in the Province of South Tyrol, where he met his grandson, Walter, and his granddaughter, Patrizia, for the first time, then returned to Rapallo, where Olga Rudge was waiting to join them.|$|E
500|$|A Different Kind of Truth was {{described}} by Roth as [...] "a sort of collaboration with [...] past." [...] Seven of the album's tracks are based on material which Roth suggested dated back to between 1975 and 1977, whilst Eddie indicated that others had been composed [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> high school and even junior high." [...] "Blood and Fire" [...] dates back to 1984. An instrumental version of the song, titled [...] "Ripley", appeared in Eddie's score for the film The Wild Life. The original title had been inspired by the Ripley guitar used by Eddie on the demo, and he sent that guitar back to Steve Ripley for repair {{so that it could}} be used on the album version.|$|E
500|$|After {{writing songs}} with themes of {{independence}} for Control and social injustice for Rhythm Nation 1814, Jackson desired to devote {{her new album}} to love and relationships, describing the theme of her new album as [...] "intimacy" [...] and that [...] "exual communication {{is the name of}} the game." [...] She stated in an interview with David Wild for Rolling Stone that [...] "hile I was doing Rhythm Nation, I was thinking about how things were so hard, so regimented and so black and white... I thought I'd do something on the sexy side—which is hard for me since I grew up as a tomboy and don't really think of myself that way. But I think this album is more on the feminine tip." [...] She also commented on how her experience acting in Poetic Justice played a role in taking a new direction with her music. Speaking with biographer David Ritz, she stated that [...] "Rhythm Nation was a heavy record, and Poetic Justice was a heavy movie. I wanted to do something lighter but also daring... When I wrote the album, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> a poetic frame of mind, inspired by Maya's beautiful language. You can hear that inspiration or the interludes and especially on the song [...] "New Agenda". This time I felt much freer expressing myself." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{ship was}} built for [...] the United States Shipping Board in Toledo, Ohio (Yard Number:143) by the Toledo Shipbuilding Company. A Standard World War I cargo ship, she was laid down as War Flag, but named Lake Sunapee after the lake in New Hampshire. She was {{launched}} on 28 December 1917, while World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> progress.

2500|$|Rodney Hogg was {{interested}} in touring South Africa. He met with Ali Bacher in London during the 1983 Cricket World Cup. [...] "I was pretty much in from day one," [...] said Hogg. I was in my mid-30s, and {{the idea was that}} the tour wouldn't happen for another year or two. Had it been on in 1983, I'd have been less interested as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> the Test side and doing well at the time.... I was pretty happy with the money on offer. My career was pretty much over by then. Fast bowlers don't last forever. Prime minister [...] Hawke called us traitors. I thought that if it was okay for Hawke to trade with South Africa, it was okay for me to go and play cricket there." ...|$|E
60|$|A month had passed, a swift-flying time full of new life. Wonderful {{it was for}} me {{to think}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> Diane Sampson's employ.|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{was very}} certain about it." [...] Gross sounded pleased. [...] "He called me quite early. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> bed. You know, {{this calls for}} a celebration." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Moths, this morning? What a very learned {{person you}} will become." [...] Her {{voice was a}} little flat, yet tender; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> the sulks, and made no answer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Must I listen, Pharaoh," [...] {{he said in}} {{a little}} voice, [...] "while my cousin the Royal Princess reproaches me in public for my lame foot, which I have because my nurse let me fall when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> arms?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It may be," [...] said he to Ambrose, [...] "that I shall {{change my}} mind {{altogether}} about the place;--but as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> doubt, let everything go on till Saturday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lenora, {{where are}} you?" [...] he signalled. [...] "I {{have taken a}} lodging in the Servants' Club. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> hiding, hoping that Craig may come here. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very anxious about you." ...|$|R
60|$|While <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> {{attendance}} at his bedside, I {{heard from the}} secretary. He inclosed a letter, directed {{to me in a}} strange handwriting. I opened the envelope and looked for the signature. My friend had been entrapped into sending me an anonymous letter.|$|E
60|$|While <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> this {{delightful}} dream, we came {{suddenly in}} front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with {{a smile on his face}} and a capital imitation of a sailor's walk.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>WAS</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> doubt, {{whether to}} enter the room, or to wait outside until she left Browndown {{to return to the}} rectory--when Lucilla's keen sense of hearing decided the {{question}} which I had been unable to settle for myself.

60|$|A {{woman of}} about five-and-thirty, with an aquiline face, and a long, dark, silky beard {{sweeping}} {{down to her}} waist. Whatever this woman's charms might have been for me when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> the profession, she could now boast of very few. Doubtless {{she had been in}} Sir Runan's show, and was one of his victims.|$|E
60|$|The {{picture of}} the {{full-fledged}} Lane, who made a very poor figure in the saddle at any time, careering panic stricken across the prairie with his arms about the neck of a bolting horse appealed to me; but as {{to the possibility of}} the usurer's future discomfiture <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> the dark, and asked for enlightenment.|$|E
60|$|She read {{my letter}} to the two old ladies, in the morning, and {{approved}} of it. I posted it, and {{had nothing to do}} then, but wait, as patiently as I could, for the reply. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> this state of expectation, and had been, for nearly a week; when I left the Doctor's one snowy night, to walk home.|$|E
5000|$|... 3 May 1918 - <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> {{hospital}} although {{removed to}} Lindi by river boat. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> feeling pleased {{today as the}} M. O. is evacuating me. It is now a matter {{of waiting for the}} hospital ship.|$|R
6000|$|... "Four o'clock.--Half an hour since, I {{put on my}} bonnet to go out {{and post}} the letter to Midwinter myself. And here <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> my room, with my mind torn by doubts, and my letter on the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Much {{obliged to}} you for calling," [...] Mr. Bundercombe said hospitably. [...] "Drop in and have a little game of cards with me any {{afternoon}} you like. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{a bit out of}} practice, but <b>I</b> fancy <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> your class." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} day I {{was obliged to}} go to Nice, and did not return till midnight. The porter told me that Jules le Ferrier had been to see me. The next morning, while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> bed, the door was opened, and Jules appeared. His face was very pale; and the moment he stood still drops of perspiration began coursing down his cheeks.|$|E
60|$|She {{dropped her}} chin till it hid the little, dimple-like {{depression}} below her throat, {{which was one}} of her charms, and began not to look at, but to study me, seeing which I shut my eyes tight and waited. Evidently she thought that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> my swoon, for now she spoke to herself in a low voice that was soft and sweet as honey.|$|E
60|$|And then Lady Malvern came back, a {{good bit}} ahead of schedule. I hadn't been expecting her for days. I'd {{forgotten}} how time had been slipping along. She turned up one morning while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> bed sipping tea and thinking of this and that. Jeeves flowed in with the announcement {{that he had just}} loosed her into the sitting-room. I draped a few garments round me and went in.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> {{perceive}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> the dark. You {{speak of}} shuffling and dealing; pray for what end? And since you seem rather unwilling to die than otherwise, I must own that I cannot conceive {{what brings you}} here at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{seems to}} be some {{disability}} attaching to you, my Beetle, or else why should Burton major withdraw, so to speak, the hem of his garments? <b>I</b> confess <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> the dark. Will some one be good enough to enlighten me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} comforted by prayer," [...] he told me. [...] "The {{weakness}} of poor humanity has found {{strength in the}} Lord." [...] He pointed to the portrait once more: [...] "My hands must not presume to touch it, while <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> doubt. Take it down." ...|$|R
