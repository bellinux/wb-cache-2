40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the dynamics of an arterial first pass gadolinium (Gd) contrast medium (CM) bolus at the descending aorta (DAo), depending on various saline <b>flush</b> and Gd <b>volumes.</b> Using an ultra-fast two- dimensional GE-sequence (Siemens Vision®, 1. 5 -T), 200 sequential cross-sectional images of the addressed vessel (1 slice/s) were obtained. Several saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes</b> (15 mL, 30 mL, and 60 mL) were applied following the administration of 10 mL Gd (single dose) {{to a group of}} 4 normal volunteers (body weight 50 – 55 kg) using a mechanical MR injector (injection rate = 3. 0 mL/s). Additionally, when performing a second test series, the saline volume remained constant, while the Gd volumes were varied from half doses to triple doses (5, 10, 20, and 30 mL Gd were given to every volunteer of the group). The signal intensity versus time (SI/T) curve at a measured region of interest (ROI) within the DAo was calculated. The bolus arrival time (BAT), the maximal signal-to-noise ratio (SNRmax), the bolus time length (BL; 75 and 80 maximum intensity duration), the slope of the SI/T curve, and the areas below the SI/T curve for both the 80 and 75 maximum intensity duration level (INT 80 and INT 75) were calculated. The increase of saline <b>flush</b> <b>volume</b> from 30 to 60 mL caused significant bolus lengthening of approximately 50 (mean BL = 9. 5 s, 10. 3 s, and 15. 4 s for 15 mL, 30 mL, and 60 mL saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes,</b> respectively, measured as SI/T duration at the 75 SNRmax level). Using saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes</b> equal to or higher than 30 mL increased the slope of the SI/T curve. A continuous increase of INT 75 / 80 by using higher saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes</b> was found. Different saline and Gd volumes did not affect the SNRmax and the BAT. Only the low dose (0. 05 mmol/kg Gd) showed a 17 – 21. 6 significantly lower SNRmax. The BL and the INT increased mainly by enlarging of applied Gd volume from single to double dose (BL 75 and INT 75 were 9. 6 s and 1305, 12. 3 s and 2121, 38. 5 s and 6181, 37. 8 s and 6613 for 5, 10, 20, and 30 mL applied Gd volume, respectively). The arterial bolus length benefits from increasing Gd and saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes</b> due to increased venous bolus length and wash out effects of Gd within the injection site of the vein. Doses larger than a single dose are not needed to increase the SNR in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography images of the thoracic aorta...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic binary translators (DBTs) are {{becoming}} increas-ingly important {{because of their}} power and flexibility. How-ever, the high memory demands of DBTs present an obsta-cle for all platforms, and especially embedded systems. The memory demand is typically controlled by placing a limit on cached translations and forcing the DBT to flush all trans-lations upon reaching the limit. This solution manifests as a performance inefficiency because many flushed translations require retranslation. Ideally, translations should be selec-tively flushed to minimize retranslations for a given memory limit. However, three obstacles exist: (1) {{it is difficult to}} pre-dict which selections will minimize retranslation, (2) selec-tive flushing results in greater book-keeping overheads than <b>full</b> <b>flushing,</b> and (3) the emergence of multicore processors and multi-threaded programming complicates most flushing algorithms.

50|$|In public facilities, {{the trend}} is toward sensor-operated (automatic) {{fixtures}} that improve hygiene and save money. For example, sensor operated automatic-flush urinals have fewer moving parts, reduce wear, and tend to last longer than manual-flush valves. Also they ensure fixtures are flushed only once per use. Some contain intelligence that flushes them at different amounts of water flow depending on traffic patterns: e.g., the fixture can detect a lineup of users and only give a <b>full</b> <b>flush</b> after the last person has used the urinal. For the same purpose, dual-flush toilets are also becoming more popular. A combination of both technologies can allow for saved power and water.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} the {{relation}} between contrast medium (CM) application and sequence parameters will be discussed with respect to clinical use of the contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) in the peripheral vessel region. The adjustment of the sequence parameters, the CM application timing and the bolus geometry is necessary for an effective use of CE-MRA. Investigation protocols for several vascular regions differ mainly corresponding to varying fields of view and slab thickness. Restrictions of increasing the measurement time are expected in peripherally localized vessels if fast arteriovenous transit time occurs. The vessel contrast depends from (1) optimal CM bolus timing and (2) bolus geometry defined by {{the parameters of the}} intravenous bolus injection (flow rate, dose and NaCl <b>flush</b> <b>volume).</b> Our study results have shown that the bolus remains compact but also shorter if a higher flow rate is being applied at equal dose. The enlargement of the NaCl <b>flush</b> <b>volume</b> has evidently caused an increased intraarterial CM concentration and a slightly bolus lengthening. The exact timing regimen requires an automated mechanical CM injection pump. In most countries, a total dose of 0. 3 mmol/kg Gd is allowed for application during one investigation. Therefore, obtaining an angiogram of the entire iliac and leg region this total dose must be separated. 0. 1 mmol/kg {{for each of the three}} measurements can be recommended. Otherwise, using this lower CM dose results in less spatial resolution. At least a dosage of 0. 2 mmol/kg Gd is necessary to achieve a higher spatial resolution. The calculation of CM dosage should be also related to the dedicated vessel region of interest than to the body weight only...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} assessment as {{to water}} consumption in WC cisterns {{has contributed to}} the development of flushing system technologies, which allow smaller <b>flushing</b> <b>volumes.</b> The purpose of this work is to assess the performance of the the low water consumption requirement of WC cisterns with dual flushing system (6 / 3 L), when compared to 6 L <b>flushing</b> <b>volume</b> WC cisterns in multifamily buildings. The research methodology consisted of a case study in a multifamily residential building with submetering system, by monitoring the total water consumption and the two flushing systems using water meters installed in WC cisterns. By means of a mathematical model, a comparison of the design flowrate in the main branch was carried out considering the two types of WC cisterns. The results indicated that the water consumption in the 6 L WC cistern was 20 % in relation to the total domestic consumption, whereas the water consumption observed in the dual-flush WC cistern (6 / 3 L) was 16 %. The dual flushing system (6 / 3 L) presented about 18 % consumption reduction impact as compared to the 6 L system. The design flowrate values in the main branch, obtained by the mathematical model, were 0. 35 L/s for systems with 6 L WC cistern and 0. 34 L/s with dual-flush WC cistern (6 / 3 L), that is, a reduction of similar to 3 %. Practical application: The knowledge of the performance in field of dual-flush WC cistern contributes to industry to improve this system and to users to aid their choice of technologies aimed at water conservation, and so assisting to the development of sustainable buildings...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{velocity}} of dripline flushing in subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems affects system design, cost, management, performance, and longevity. A 30 ‐day field {{study was conducted}} at Kansas State University to analyze the effect of four targeted flushing velocities (0. 23, 0. 30, 0. 46, and 0. 61 m/s) for a fixed 15 min duration of flushing and three flushing frequencies (no flushing or flushing every 15 or 30 days) on SDI emitter discharge and sediments within the dripline and removed in the flushing water. At {{the end of the}} field experiment (371 h), the amount of solids carried away by the flushing water and retained in every lateral were determined as well as laboratory determination of emitter discharge for every single emitter within each dripline. Greater dripline flushing velocities, which also resulted in greater <b>flushing</b> <b>volumes,</b> tended to result in greater amounts of solids in the flushing water, but the differences were not always statistically significant. Neither the frequency of flushing nor the interaction of flushing frequency and velocity significantly affected the amount of solids in the flushing water. There was a greater concentration of solids in the beginning one‐third of the 90 m laterals, particularly for treatments with no flushing or with slower dripline flushing velocities. As flushing velocity and concurrently <b>flushing</b> <b>volume</b> increased, there was a tendency for greater solids removal and/or more equal distribution within the dripline. At the end of the field study, the average emitter discharge as measured in the laboratory for a total of 3970 emitters was 0. 64 L/h. which was significantly less (approximately 2. 5 %) than the discharge for new and unused emitters.
