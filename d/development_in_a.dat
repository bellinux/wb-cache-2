5|$|During the Great Depression Flanders {{began to}} write about social policy. His major concern was human <b>development</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{technological}} era. He addressed employing spiritual guidance with a “program of human values” to achieve a good life. Nevertheless, his underlying goal was to achieve “full employment.” So, he kept himself grounded in economic principles, as understood and debated during that era.|$|E
5|$|International District/Chinatown station shares its {{block with}} Union Station, the {{headquarters}} of Sound Transit. The block also has the Union Station and Opus Center office complex, built on a large concrete lid covering the tunnel and an underground parking garage. To {{the west of the}} station on South Jackson Street is historic King Street Station, served by Amtrak and Sounder commuter rail, and the offices of King County Metro at the King Street Center. The Weller Street Bridge connects the station's south plaza to CenturyLink Field, Safeco Field, and Stadium Place, a mixed-use <b>development</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> former stadium parking lot. To the station's east is the Historic Chinatown Gate, as well as the flagship store of Asian grocer Uwajimaya.|$|E

5|$|The {{baseline}} {{standard for}} the construction of or expansion to a freeway in Ontario is an average daily traffic count of 10,000 vehicles per day. However, other factors are considered as well, particularly future traffic volume forecasts. To promote economic <b>development</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> disadvantaged region (e.g., the current extension of Highway 400 to Northern Ontario), a 400-series highway may be built where the existing highway's traffic counts fall below 10,000.|$|E
5|$|The field {{grew from}} 19th century beginnings, where {{embryology}} faced a mystery: zoologists {{did not know}} how embryonic development was controlled at the molecular level. Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, recombinant DNA technology at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics. A key early discovery was of homeotic genes that regulate <b>development</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wide range of eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{full-size}} mock-up inspection in April 1949 {{was generally}} favorable, range again became a concern since the J40s and early model J57s had excessive fuel consumption. Despite talk of another revision of specifications {{or even a}} full design competition among aircraft manufacturers, General LeMay, {{now in charge of}} Strategic Air Command, insisted that performance should not be compromised due to delays in engine <b>development.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> final attempt to increase range, Boeing created the larger 464-67, stating that once in production, the range could be further increased in subsequent modifications. Following several direct interventions by LeMay, Boeing was awarded a production contract for thirteen B-52As and seventeen detachable reconnaissance pods on 14 February 1951. The last major design change—also at General LeMay's insistence—was a switch from the B-47 style tandem seating to a more conventional side-by-side cockpit, which increased the effectiveness of the copilot and reduced crew fatigue. Both XB-52 prototypes featured the original tandem seating arrangement with a framed bubble-type canopy.|$|E

5|$|From October 1951 to May 1954 Wolson was Commandant of the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. He {{then became}} {{commander}} of the Third Air Force in the United Kingdom, also becoming head of the Military Assistance Advisory Group for the United Kingdom on 1 November 1956. At the time, the Third Air Force {{was responsible for the}} only tactical nuclear weapons in Europe, so Wilson was a logical choice as commander. After returning to the United States in July 1957, he became the Air Force member of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Development. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 1 July 1958 when he became Deputy Chief of Staff, <b>Development.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> reorganization of the area on 1 July 1961, he became Deputy Chief of Staff, Research and Technology.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{somewhat}} controversial {{argument is}} that evolution in animals (though no doubt similar processes occur in other organisms) proceeds mostly by modifying the way that regulatory genes, which do not code for structural proteins (such as enzymes), control embryonic development. In turn, these regulatory genes {{turn out to be}} based on a very old set of highly conserved genes which Carroll nicknames the toolkit. Almost identical sequences can be found across the animal kingdom, meaning that toolkit genes such as Hox must have evolved before the Cambrian radiation which created most of the animal body plans that exist today. These genes are used and reused, occasionally by duplication but far more often by being applied unchanged to new functions. Thus the same signal may be given at a different time in <b>development,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different part of the embryo, creating a different effect on the adult body. In Carroll's view, this explains how so many body forms are created with so few structural genes.|$|E
