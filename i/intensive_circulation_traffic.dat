40|$|In Malaysia, {{as in many}} {{developed}} countries, {{the increase}} in demand for car parks usually outstrips the supply, especially {{in the inner cities}} and at shopping malls. Although vehicles using off street parking do not directly interact with traffic flow, it is common knowledge that on exit from the car parks they have direct impact on adjoining traffic flows. A study is conducted to determine the additional traffic flow onto the adjoining roadway form Jusco shopping mall. Besides, it also to compare the traffic flows on the adjoining roadway before and after additional vehicle volume from Jusco shopping mall.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the regularities of {{circulation}} of epidemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains {{in the intensive care}} unit and to formulate main prophylactic measures against pseudomonas infections. Materials and methods: A prospective epi-demiological observation was made with daily microbiological monitoring of major loci in patients and environmental objects {{in the intensive care unit}} for 244 days. A total of 1314 clinical material samples from 888 patients and 488 washes from hospital environmental objects were studied and 211 P. aeruginosa strains were identified by microbiological, serological, and molecular genetic studies. Results. <b>Intensive</b> <b>circulation</b> of epidemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains of predominantly O 12 serogroup was found in the intensive care unit. The main sources of infection were patients and moist hospital environmental objects; the most important transmission routes are the hands of medical staff and anesthetic respiratory equipment. There was a predominant lesion in the respiratory tract: the incidence of pseudomonas infection was 3. 5 times greater than that in the patients on mechanical ventilation equipment. The basic prophylactic measures in the intensive care unit, which are aimed at eliminating P. aeruginosa, should involve daily observation of necessary sanitary-hygienic and antiepidemic rules and organization of care for patients.

40|$|Despite the {{increased}} use of vaccination in several Asian countries, Japanese Encephalitis (JE) remains the most important cause of viral encephalitis in Asia in humans with an estimated 68, 000 cases annually. Considered a rural disease occurring mainly in paddy-field dominated landscapes where pigs are amplifying hosts, JE may nevertheless circulate in a wider range of environment given the diversity of its potential hosts and vectors. The main objective {{of this study was to}} assess the intensity of JE transmission to pigs in a peri-urban environment in the outskirt of Phnom Penh, Cambodia. We estimated the force of JE infection in two cohorts of 15 sentinel pigs by fitting a generalised linear model on seroprevalence monitoring data observed during two four-month periods in 2014. Our results provide evidence for <b>intensive</b> <b>circulation</b> of JE virus in a periurban area near Phnom Penh, the capital and most populated city of Cambodia. Understanding JE virus transmission in different environments is important for planning JE virus control in the long term and is also an interesting model to study the complexity of vector-borne diseases. Collecting quantitative data such as the force of infection will help calibrate epidemiological model that can be used to better understand complex vector-borne disease epidemiological cycles.

40|$|Abstract. Variability in {{time and}} space related with the main a�ribute of {{material}} mobility is one of the essential features of nature including relief. The aim {{of this study is to}} show the selected geomorphological and sedimentological results of sandy ma�er circulation (formation of new landforms and microforms) and to determine the importance of wind in this process within large active sandpits in the Silesian Upland in the southern part of Poland, which are areas of sand circulation, intensified by anthropogenic factor. The human impact very o�en entails certain changes of relief. Based on direct observations of variability of sandy landforms and microforms, it is assumed that an <b>intensive</b> <b>circulation</b> of sandy material has been taking place in the areas analysed. During the period of observation, repeated transitions of sandy material from one environment into another occurred, what resulted in the formation of new landforms, which, in their turn, underwent decay and were replaced by new forms. Frequent changes of particular driving forces of transport, i. e. sedimentation environment followed. Wind action is the prevailing natural factor shaping the sandpit bo�oms and slopes. Aeolian processes in sandpits play a role of double importance. Firstly, they take part in the sandy material circulation in different sedimentation environments, secondly, wind causes quick devastation, masking or retouching of formerly existing landforms...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is about the {{influence}} of network structure and road classification on road safety. Road safety, or unsafety, is usually expressed as the number of crashes or casualties. It is not evident how one can relate what happens at street level to the decisions regarding network design and the elaboration of this design. <b>Traffic</b> <b>circulation</b> can be regarded as the link between these two levels. Behind <b>traffic</b> <b>circulation</b> is the individual who decides to travel from a point of origin to a destination, using a particular route. The route is the starting point for this study. That is because network structure and road classification are important preconditions for <b>traffic</b> <b>circulation</b> and route choice, while the intersecting routes will determine the crash locations. This study will therefore focus on the effects of changing route choices on road safety. The changes in route choice may be the result of: 1. (intended) changes {{in the structure of the}} road network; 2. a change in <b>traffic</b> <b>circulation,</b> e. g. on account of an alteration of a traffic signal system or of congestion on the main roads; 3. instructions to car drivers through navigation systems or route guidance signs. These changes, adaptations and instructions aim to improve the traffic and transport system as a whole. This study is undertaken to find the effect of the changes/instructions enumerated above on the safety of all road users in the road network. This study will show whether an improvement can be attained and how it can be attained. In this study, an attempt was made to connect different worlds; the world of transport network design, the world of route choice research, the world of micro-simulation modelling, and finally, the world of surrogate safety measures (conflict indicators).

40|$|AbstractTraffic impact studies (TIS) {{have been}} {{required}} by transportation agencies to evaluate the potential transportation impacts of the proposed development on the surrounding neighborhood since 2001 in Beijing. The analysis on the negative aspect brought by proposed projects in terms of improper location and excessive number of driveways or inappropriate opening of median becomes the focus of TIS. However, {{the analysis of the}} traffic conflicts generated by proposed development has been so far limited to qualitative interpretation and conflict diagrams in traffic impact reports, which makes it difficult for traffic professionals to evaluate <b>traffic</b> <b>circulation</b> plans. The objective of this paper attempts to explore to quantify traffic conflicts analysis. Concept of conflict complexity is, for the first time, introduced in this study as a new evaluation indicator. The model to estimate conflict complexity is then built up by putting vehicle-bicycle conflict, vehicle-pedestrian conflict and vehicle-vehicle conflict into consideration. This indicator can be used to quantitatively determine if <b>traffic</b> <b>circulation</b> proposed in TIS report is justified. Finally, based on the data from 65 TIS reports from Beijing city the threshold values for criterion are determined in the study. The result from this study will help transportation agencies make decision for the proposed projects in quantitative manner.
