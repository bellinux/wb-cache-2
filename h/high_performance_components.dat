50|$|In 1986 Vandenberg {{turned her}} {{attention}} to the quality control of the crystal growth of InGaAsP multi-quantum well (MQW) layers, used as laser light sources and optical modulators designed to work in the 1.3 to 1.55 µm wavelength range. Advancing the design, performance and manufacturability of these devices had been the focus of all the leading optical component suppliers for decades. These devices are manufactured using organometallic vapor phase epitaxy, a complex process involving multiple sources subject to drift. Manufacture of early devices was based on unacceptably low (much less than 1%) end-to-end yields. Dramatic improvement was needed to produce the <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> <b>components</b> used to transport the massive amounts of data in today's Internet. In many cases mono-layer thickness control is required along with variations in bandgap less than 0.5%. This high level of quality control must be achieved using complex crystal growth machines which can fail in hundreds of ways. To insure that these multiple failure modes do not impact the final device, Vandenberg designed a one-room (later bench-top) non-destructive high-resolution X-ray diffractometer to provide immediate on-line feedback into the MQW growth process. She constructed robust algorithms linking X-ray features to layer thickness and strain information essential to crystal growth control and optoelectronic device performance. Her X-ray diffraction technique was successfully deployed in a manufacturing environment. All Internet lasers are now manufactured using her tool X-Ray Crystallography, and their operational lifetime exceeds 25 years.|$|E

The aim of this research was to analyze the influence of the molding temperature and cooling time on the residual stresses present in parts of two types of crystal polystyrene PS 1 and PS 2, processed by injection molding. The results obtained using photoelasticity showed that at low temperatures the residual stresses increase due to the processes of formation and destruction of intermolecular forces. Internal stresses were reduced in the polymer specimens with greater thickness because the molecular relaxation of chains of polystyrene is facilitated by the space increase between the walls of the mold.

40|$|Purpose: The paper proposes an {{overview}} of the actual most important and applied rheocasting technologies for the manufacturing of <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> Al <b>components.</b> Some excellent results recently attained in industrial applications are presented and discussed. Design/methodology/approach: Samples were machined from the produced parts and mechanical tests, i. e. tensile and impact, were executed on series of samples; moreover, microstructure features and the morphology of fractures were observed to check the quality of alloys and of produced castings. Findings: Despite the numerous rheocasting processes recently developed, it appears that their industrial application is still limited and some only are really interesting for the production of <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> <b>component.</b> The done investigations show that the use of a very simple and well controlled process leads to produce parts having excellent properties and reliability. The results obtained up to now suggest that the rheocasting route can be considered an attractive fabrication technology to produce high quality products, especially for aluminium alloys. Research limitations/implications: A lot of rheocasting processes are proposed, but for the final success it is necessary to choice a really valid process and to maintain all the steps under a strict control. Practical implications: The obtained results can be used for searching the appropriate way of improving the performance of highly stressed parts, using a very competitive and simple rheocasting process, contributing to make aluminium and its alloys still more attractive for light-weighting components for structural, as well as for automotive and aeronautic/aerospace applications. Originality/value: The main SSM technologies and future trends are presented and discussed.
