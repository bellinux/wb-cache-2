40|$|EXAMINATION OF THE CORROLATION OF CRITICAL SUCCESS AND DELAY FACTORS IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIAMohammed M Alkhathami, PhDUniversity of Pittsburgh, 2004 The goal of {{all parties}} {{involved}} in a construction project - owners, contractors, or consultants, in either the private or public sector - is to successfully complete it on schedule, within a planned budget, with the highest quality, and in the safest manner. Construction projects are frequently influenced by either success factors that help project parties reach their goal as planned, or <b>delay</b> <b>factors,</b> that stifle or postpone project completion. Accurately identifying success and <b>delay</b> <b>factors</b> can help project parties reach their intended goals with greater efficiency. This study extracted seven {{of the most important}} success and <b>delay</b> <b>factors</b> according to the literature (14 total success and <b>delay</b> <b>factors),</b> and then examined correlations between them to determine which were the most influential in preventing project delays. Two surveys were distributed throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The first examined how project owners and contractors that collaborated on the same project perceived success and <b>delay</b> <b>factors,</b> while the second examined the perceptions of engineers in general. Data was collected and evaluated by statistical methods to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between critical success and <b>delay</b> <b>factors,</b> to examine owners' and contractors' evaluations of projects' critical success and <b>delay</b> <b>factors,</b> and to evaluate the influence of critical success <b>factors</b> on critical <b>delay</b> <b>factors.</b> Additionally, one and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been used to examine how the group or groups evaluated the influence of the critical success factors in avoiding or preventing each of the <b>delay</b> <b>factors,</b> and which success factors were perceived as most influential in avoiding or preventing critical <b>delay</b> <b>factors.</b> The research found that sound organization planning efforts and a competent and experienced project manager helped to avoid many critical <b>delay</b> <b>factors,</b> while adherence to safety precautions and procedures and a project team's motivation and goal orientation were the least influential among the seven success factors...|$|R

The majority of the leading <b>delays</b> <b>factors</b> found from reviewing other studies were avoidable <b>delay</b> <b>factors.</b> The avoidable <b>delay</b> <b>factors</b> are factors caused only by the contractor.

A questionnaire was developed with questions that will probe the respondents to select the mitigation measures that will address each of the ten avoidable <b>delay</b> <b>factors.</b> The option answers were specifically designed to be close-ended. The size of the sample required was 80 and this study managed to get 82 responses. The survey was launched using SurveyMonkey which is an online survey platform. The data received was analysed for reliability and validity. The reliability was determined using Pearson Correlation Coefficient and was applied using the testretest approach. All questions had a coefficient greater than 0. 6 which meant that the responses were reliable (strong). The validity was established using face validity. The responses were analysed to establish which mitigation measures have more frequency of selection. Some of the questions had some mitigation measures receiving more than 80 % of the selection and some questions had some mitigation measures getting almost the same percentage selection.

In the round robin systems (e.g., TDMA) the user access to the channel is known in advance, so that its scheduling delay can be easily calculated. However, in opportunistic multiuser systems where the users with the best channel conditions are selected for transmission based on their instantaneous SNIR, a user does not have any guarantee for being scheduled in a specific time, which increases its scheduling delay.|$|E

40|$|Construction {{industries}} {{in many countries}} have been increasingly recognising {{the need for more}} efficient and timely completion of projects. Often, a number of unexpected problems and changes from original design arise during the construction phase, leading to cost and time overruns. Therefore, exploring the reasons for delay is one of the prerequisites of keeping the cost within budget and of good construction time performance. The primary objective of this research is to identify the principal <b>factors</b> responsible for <b>delays</b> in the UK construction industry, and determine their relative importance as perceived by contractors. A questionnaire survey, based on 64 <b>delay</b> <b>factors,</b> grouped into eight factor categories, was conducted. Responses were received, and the <b>delay</b> <b>factors</b> were ranked in order by the researcher, based upon these responses. The results of this research indicate the main causes of delay in construction projects in the UK. The ten most significant <b>delay</b> <b>factors</b> are: <b>delays</b> in design information, low speed of decision making, necessary variations, small extent of design information available at construction start, client-initiated variations, project design complexity, inadequate design team experience, shortage of skilled labour, mistakes and discrepancies in design documents, and unforeseen ground conditions. Also, the "consultant-related" category was ranked the highest by contractors. An interview questionnaire was drafted to explore the effects of those top ten significant <b>delay</b> <b>factors</b> with respect to real construction projects completed during 2006 - 2007. The interviews provided the opportunity to analyse deeper the top ten <b>delay</b> <b>factors</b> within real construction projects. The findings suggest that if special attention is given to the significant <b>delay</b> <b>factors</b> ranked in this research it will help industry practitioners to minimise the risk of delays.

The random access protocol of IEEE 802. 16 d/e is based on orthogonal frequency-division-multiple-access (OFDMA) -code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) with time-division-duplexing (TDD) mode and increases round-trip-time (RTT) of TCP flows over uplink transmission. And to speed TCP throughput up without revising existing TCP implementations, RTT of wireless portion in the wired-cum-wireless environment among many factors needs to be reduced by the MAC layer. In this paper, we analyze the <b>delay</b> <b>factor</b> of the random access protocol of IEEE 802. 16 d/e considering the implementation complexity and show that it is closely related to TCP performance.

One of the conclusions is that the river reservoir simulated by TRIP at the global scale {{seems to be one}} of the main sources of TWS and/or discharge errors. Here, the authors study these uncertainties in river routing processes, such as flow velocity and groundwater storage. For this purpose, a simple groundwater reservoir depending on a time <b>delay</b> <b>factor</b> and a variable streamflow velocity calculated via Manning’s formula are added to TRIP following the approach of Arora and Boer. The previous and the new TRIP are then compared, and two studies of the sensitivity to the groundwater time <b>delay</b> <b>factor</b> and to the flow velocity are performed. Using the same experiment design as in Part I, the authors show that the effect of this flow velocity and of the groundwater time <b>delay</b> <b>factor</b> on the ISBA-TRIP simulation is potentially significant. Nevertheless, over tropical and temperate basins, a competition between the two processes implies a slight difference between the previous and the new TRIP compared to both the GRACE and the discharge signals. The global results underline that simulating a realistic streamflow velocity is a key process for global-scale application. 1...|$|E

Frequency and severity index method are used to identify and compare the <b>delay</b> <b>factors</b> in Libya and the UK. Statistical experiments are used to test the relationship and confidence level of survey results. A case study of a building project is used to evaluate the functions of the DAS. Findings – The survey illustrated that construction projects suffered more delays in Libya than the UK.
