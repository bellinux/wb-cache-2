The first floor sold <b>impulse</b> <b>goods</b> such as gloves, hats, purses and hosiery. It featured a patterned terrazzo floor and eighteen foot ornamental ceiling. Columns had ornamental capitals with Texas-motifs. The second floor sold women's and misses' clothes as well as furs and featured differently themed [...] "galleries". Children's clothes and lingerie were located on the third floor, originally decorated with peach and apricot colors. House wares such as rugs, draperies, and furniture were on the fourth floor. The fifth floor featured glass ware and china, and the employee restrooms and hospital. The offices were on the sixth floor. On the seventh floor was a 600-seat auditorium that could also be converted into four small conference spaces. A basement and sub-basement held the mechanical equipment as well as a state-of-the-art refrigerated fur vault that could hold up to 3,000 fur coats. The cooling system cooled the basement and first floor.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The study aims to {{increase}} knowledge of dealers' purchasing behavior of <b>impulse</b> <b>goods</b> in wholesale trade. Methodology: An exploratory survey method {{has been selected}} in order to investigate the relatively unexplored topic; buyer behavior of <b>impulse</b> <b>goods</b> in the wholesale. Data has been collected through interview of 27 dealers that conduct business with bulk confectionery sales across Sweden. A semi-structured interview technique has been selected, with a predetermined interview schedule but with space for follow-up questions and discussion. Conclusion: The background to this work argued {{that there is not}} much research on how retailers reasons when buying convenience products, or also called as impulse items. It is usually the sale of goods such as several of the informants believe is critical to their business existence. <b>Impulse</b> <b>goods</b> which do not require any effort, has little search time and usually are cheap and suits many customers pockets. It was therefore of interest to investigate whether the retailer is acting as their customers when they buy in bulk confectionery, which separated this study and considered to be an impulse to be, by definition, from wholesalers like Axfood Närlivs. What are the factors they take into consideration when choosing a product? How do they reflect on price, quality, delivery, access and communication with the wholesaler...|$|E

60|$|All {{this rather}} turned Nat's head; {{and as he}} sat in the {{brilliant}} opera-house, chatted among the ladies at some select coffee-party, or whisked an eminent professor's amiable daughter down the room, trying to imagine she was Daisy, he often asked himself if this gay fellow could be the poor homeless little Street musician who once stood waiting in the rain at the gates of Plumfield. His heart was true, his <b>impulses</b> <b>good,</b> and his ambitions high; but the weak side of his nature came uppermost here; vanity led him astray, pleasure intoxicated him, and for a time he forgot everything but the delights of this new and charming life. Without meaning to deceive, he allowed people to imagine him a youth of good family and prospects; he boasted a little of Mr Laurie's wealth and influence, of Professor Bhaer's eminence, and the flourishing college at which he himself had been educated. Mrs Jo was introduced to the sentimental Frauleins who read her books, and the charms and virtues of his own dear Madchen confided to sympathetic mammas. All these boyish boastings and innocent vanities were duly circulated among the gossips, and his importance much increased thereby, to his surprise and gratification, as well as some shame.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} partial {{results of}} primary research on consumer purchasing behaviour {{with regards to}} the utilization of product leaflets. It deals with the consumer reaction on the use of these leaflets. The main goal is to assess the <b>impulse</b> to purchase <b>goods</b> on the basis of promotional leaflets in mailboxes, depending on the personal characteristics of the consumer. Partial goals are a brief theoretical basis of the examined issues and selected results of secondary research on consumer behaviour based on available statistical data and information. Consumer behaviour changes drastically in times of crisis. Czech consumer is addressed daily by a specific communication media of store chains – the leaflets. These appear daily in mailboxes and are generally positively accepted. There are also negative opinions, both from consumers as well as the EU. Respondents were asked about their financial situation, to what extent they change their buying behaviour with respect to the income level of households. It turned out that the <b>impulse</b> to purchase <b>goods</b> on the basis of promotional leaflets in mailboxes does not depend on the age and sex of respondents, but depends on the income level and education. The largest proportion of respondents considers leaflets because of promotional discounts...|$|R
