40|$|For many {{learning}} algorithms, {{their learning}} accuracy will increase as {{the size of}} training data increases, forming the well-known <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> Usually a <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> can be fitted by interpolating or extrapolating some points on it with a specified model. The obtained <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> can then be used to predict the maximum achievable learning accuracy or to estimate the amount of data needed to achieve an expected learning accuracy, both {{of which will be}} especially meaningful to data mining on large data sets. Although some models have been proposed to model <b>learning</b> <b>curves,</b> most of them do not test their applicability to large data sets. In this paper, we focus on this issue. We empirically compare six potentially useful models by fitting <b>learning</b> <b>curves</b> of two typical classification algorithms [...] -C 4. 5 (decision tree) and LOG (logistic discrimination) on eight large UCI benchmark data sets. By using all available data for learning, we fit a full-length learning curve; by using {{a small portion of the}} data, we fit a part-length <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> The models are then compared in terms of two performances: (1) how well they fit a full-length <b>learning</b> <b>curve,</b> and (2) how well a fitted part-length <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> can predict <b>learning</b> accuracy at the full length. Experimental results show that the power law (y = a - b # x -c) is the best among the six models in both the performances for the two algorithms and all the data sets. These results support the applicability of <b>learning</b> <b>curves</b> to data mining. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> {{has been}} an {{important}} tool in the management of manufacturing operations since mid-century. Considerable empirical evidence documents the existence of <b>learning</b> <b>curves</b> in a variety of firms and industries. The efficiency gains captured by the <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> are generally considered to stem from, in part, from technology improvements. However, research into the dynamics of the <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> in service operations has been limited.

The results indicate the presence of a significant, albeit shallow, <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> Additionally, the results indicate that whether technology improvement has an effect on the rate of learning is contingent on the type and use of the technology.

40|$|Study Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} safely implementing a total laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) in established gynecologists' practices with on-site coaching and monitoring of the <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> by an experienced visiting surgeon. Design: Multicenter prospective feasibility and implementation study (Canadian Task Force classification II- 2). Setting: Eleven general gynecologists in 8 hospitals (1 university hospital and 7 regional hospitals) participated. Patients: Laparoscopic hysterectomy was performed in 83 patients during the <b>learning</b> <b>curve,</b> and in 83 patients after the <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> Interventions: During the <b>learning</b> <b>curve,</b> an experienced visiting laparoscopist was available for coaching during each LH. A competence score was marked on an Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) form. Complications were recorded intraoperatively and postoperatively for 6 weeks after surgery in all patients. Measurements and Main Results: Nine of 11 gynecologists reached the competence score of at least 28 points during the study, from January 2005 to January 2007. A major complication occurred in 3 of 83 LH procedures (4 %) performed during the <b>learning</b> <b>curve,</b> and in 5 of 83 LH procedures (6 %) performed after the <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> (p =. 72). Conclusion: The concept of a visiting surgeon for on-site coaching and monitoring of established gynecologists during the <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> of an advanced laparoscopic procedure using Objectively Structured Assessment of Technical Skills is feasible. According to the observed complication rate {{during and after the}} <b>learning</b> <b>curve,</b> on-site coaching is a useful tool when implementing a new laparoscopic technique in established gynecologists' practices.

40|$|In a {{large number}} of energy models, the use of <b>learning</b> <b>curves</b> for {{estimating}} technological improvements has become popular. This {{is based on the assumption}} that technological development can be monitored by following cost development as a function of market size. However, recent data show that in some stages of photovoltaic technology (PV) production, the market price of PV modules stabilizes even though the cumulative capacity increases. This implies that no technological improvement takes place in these periods: the cost predicted by the <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> in the PV study is lower than the market one. We propose that this bias results from ignoring the effects of input prices and scale effects, and that incorporating the input prices and scale effects into the <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> theory is an important issue in making cost predictions more reliable. In this paper, a methodology is described to incorporate the scale and input-prices effect as the additional variables into the one factor <b>learning</b> <b>curve,</b> which leads to the definition of the multi-factor <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> This multi-factor <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> is not only derived from economic theories, but also supported by an empirical study.

METHODS: For the first 40 resurfacing hip prostheses implanted by a single-surgeon radiographic 'learning curve' analysis was performed. Optimal implant positioning on preoperative digital templating was compared with the eventual implant position postoperatively, measured by six establishes radiographic parameters and compared for four chronological cohorts of patients. RESULTS: A <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> was clearly present and an optimal result was established in the last cohort.
