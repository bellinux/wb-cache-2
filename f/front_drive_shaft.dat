5000|$|... #Caption: The {{rear drive}} shaft, {{crankshaft}} and <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> of a Shay locomotive.|$|E
5000|$|Auto mode was {{featured}} on both Explorer and Expedition {{and allows for}} all-weather, full-time four-wheel drive capability on pavement as needed. In Auto mode, the engine’s torque is normally routed to the rear drive wheels. A misconception about the system is that it continuously shifts {{into and out of}} four-wheel drive as needed. This is not true, for when Auto mode is selected, the front axle hubs are permanently engaged, locking them to the front axle shafts, front differential, and <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> This is so the <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> always rotates (turns) when the vehicle is being driven at speed. The computer control system needs the <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> to turn, so that it can monitor and compare the rotational speed of both the front and rear drive shafts. If the rear drive shaft starts to turn faster than the front, the system interprets that (along with input from other sensors) as traction loss. When traction loss is detected, torque is sent forward to the front differential in 10 percent increments, via the center multi-disc clutch. As it does so, intelligent control software allows the center multi-disc clutch to behave like a geared center differential, such that [...] "driveline binding" [...] and [...] "torque windup" [...] do not occur. The transfer of torque is done in secrecy, virtually undetectable by the occupants of the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|On February 12, 2010, Toyota {{recalled}} approximately 8,000 2010 {{model year}} 4WD Tacoma trucks for potential <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> issues. The recall involves inspecting a drive shaft component which if cracked will be replaced. The Tacoma pickups were built between mid-December 2009 and early February 2010. Most affected vehicles {{have not been}} sold.|$|E
5000|$|Feb 12, 2010 [...] - [...] US: 8,000 MY 2010 4WD Tacoma pick-up trucks {{recalled}} over {{concerns about}} possible defective <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The central {{carrier and}} {{associated}} spider gears interface directly to two crown wheels {{connected to the}} <b>front</b> and rear <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The geared center {{differential}} {{would be}} used to allow the <b>front</b> and rear <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> to turn at different rotational speeds so as to eliminate any [...] "drivetrain binding" [...] or [...] "torque windup" [...] while the system was being used on pavement. The intelligent multi-disc clutch {{would be used}} to progressively transfer torque back-to-front and front-to-back between the <b>front</b> and rear <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> when needed and would also lockup providing a permanently locked front 50:50 rear torque distribution.|$|R
50|$|Within a year, the {{controller}} had become {{larger and more}} complex. A breadboard electronic version complete with sensor amplifiers and large control modules consumed the entire back end of a station wagon. Input data came from variable reluctance sensors installed at the <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft,</b> rear drive shaft, throttle, brakes, and steering. The goal was to control clutch actuation by controlling current.|$|E
50|$|Clocking {{refers to}} the angle at which the {{transfer}} case is tilted {{with reference to the}} horizontal plane. Stock Jeep clocking for the Dana 300 (1980-1986) is usually 23° and stock Eagle and Jeep/New Process clocking is usually 13°. Many factors, most notably ground clearance and <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> clearance, can necessitate a change in the clocking angle. Some aftermarket adapters feature flanges with multiple clocking options.|$|E
50|$|The Dana 300 {{part-time}} gear-driven transfer case. That uses a round {{bolt pattern}} {{and has a}} nearly flat oil pan. It is a heavy-duty, gear-driven transfer case with a 23-spline input shaft. The case is cast iron but the tail housing is aluminum. The ID number C300-15 is stamped on the case. The output for the <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> {{is on the right}} side and the rear output in line with the input. Low range is 2.62:1.|$|E
50|$|Subaru {{chose to}} {{continue}} their longstanding use of the boxer engine in the Impreza. According to Subaru, their configuration of the engine inline with the transmission minimizes body roll due to the lower center of gravity compared with offset engines in most other vehicles. The boxer design provides good vibration mitigation due {{to the principles of}} a balanced engine because the movement of each piston is largely countered by a piston in the opposing cylinder bank, eliminating the need for a counter-weighted rotating crankshaft (harmonic balancer), but with some vibration from offsets. Torque steer is also reduced with this type of powertrain layout since the <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> are of equal length and weight.|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} rotation torque generated during {{operation of a}} 4 -wheel drive vehicle is reduced using a control device whose clutch is attached to {{one part of the}} rear-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> One torque sensor senses the drive torque associated with the rear wheel <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> A second sensor senses the drive torque associated with the <b>front</b> wheel <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> Revolution count sensors sense the revolutions of each <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> By means of a microcomputer, the engagement of the clutch is changed to insure that the ratio of the torque sensors remains constant...|$|R
50|$|In {{the photo}} {{to the left}} {{are some of the}} unusual {{elements}} of the rear part of the R68. Note the exposed, hard chrome <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> connecting the rear drive on the left with the rear of the transmission on the right. A plunger attached to the rear drive limits vertical movement so the <b>front</b> of the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is connected to the transmission with a round rubber puck with holes to receive the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft's</b> attachment plate.|$|R
50|$|The K-44 {{features}} a driven double reduction front axle incorporating an interlockable differential. The steering knuckles are attached via bevel roller bearings, while the <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> uses homokinetic joints. The wheel hubs incorporates planetary gears, which permits a higher ground clearance through {{the inclusion of}} a small differential unit. The front suspension uses 3.5 in wide by 1500 mm long leaf springs and telescopic shock absorbers. The wheel size is 8.0-20", and each wheel is held in place with ten nuts.|$|E
50|$|The Dana 20 can be {{identified}} by the center rear output, cast iron construction, and deep oil pan. Like the Dana 18, it uses the Texas bolt pattern to hold the transfer case in place. This is a heavy-duty, gear-driven part-time transfer case with a 26-tooth input gear. The output for the <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> {{is on the right}} side and the rear output is in line with the input. This enables 2-wheel High to be direct-drive, which is quieter. Otherwise the Dana 20 offers the same drive modes as the Dana 18. Its low range has a ratio of 2.03:1.|$|E
50|$|New Process {{transfer}} {{cases are}} chain-driven {{and use a}} circular 6 bolt, 23-spline input on the case. The output for the <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> {{is on the left}} side. The New Process transfer cases used by AMC attach the same as the Dana 300 except that New Process cases have the front output on the left side. Interchange ('flip') is possible, but there is an indexing lug in the pattern, in an attempt to allow the transfer case to attach in only one position. Thus, some modification on the transfer case or the adapter is required.|$|E
5000|$|The winding house {{includes}} two lateral walls of mortared walls of rubble masonry supporting a square <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> and bearings. The {{remains of the}} walls are splayed at the bases and roughly 4.5 m in length, 0.95 m wide up to a height of 3 m. The <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> supported three wheels each with eight spokes. One wheel is roughly 2 m in diameter {{and the other two}} are 1.5 m in diameter. The larger wheel was a banding-break and the other two were driving wheels for lowering and raising trucks on the incline. A wooden beam with a control mechanism remains in <b>front</b> the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> A second similar wooden beam lies nearby but is no longer in position.|$|R
50|$|The unit {{itself is}} {{designed}} to independently divert the engine's power to either the axle-facing shaft or the additional PTO output shaft. This is done by two independent clutches like tooth or dog clutches which can be operated at total driveline standstill, only. Since the main gearbox changes the rotation speed by selection of a gear the PTO cannot be operated during driving. The vehicle needs to be stationary for operation therefore.On 4x4 vehicles only the rear <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> {{is used by the}} split shaft PTO gearbox requiring the vehicles 4x4 drive scheme to be of the selectable 4WD type to keep the <b>front</b> axle <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> completely decoupled during PTO operation.It is also possible to connect something other than a hydraulic pump directly to the PTO for example, fire truck pumps.|$|R
50|$|The Command-Trac {{transfer}} case has four positions: 2-HI, 4-HI, Neutral, and 4-LO. The lever {{is placed in}} 2WD HI for regular driving. This allows the two rear tires to receive power. The second position, 4WD HI, is used for driving on slippery or loose surfaces. This position locks both the <b>front</b> and rear <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> together allowing the vehicle to maintain drive as long as at least one axle has traction. The third position, Neutral, disengages both <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> from the {{transfer case}} allowing the car to roll freely; this is used for towing behind another vehicle, for example. The last position, 4WD LO is used for situations requiring higher torque or slow speed when traversing rough terrain. A common misconception is that 4WD LO provides more traction. It only changes the gear ratio and does not add any more friction between the tires and the driving surface. This position, like 4WD HI locks both the <b>front</b> and rear <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> together, and by using a lower gear ratio, allows for 2.72 times more torque (however, the speed is limited to around 25 MPH max). It {{should be noted that}} turning while in 4WD HI or LO on dry pavement is hazardous to vehicle components, through driveline binding and wheel-hop.|$|R
50|$|Predominantly, Explorer was not {{equipped}} with Two High mode {{except in the}} 1995-1996 model years. In model years 1998-up no Two High was available. Only Auto, Four High and Four Low modes were offered. Two High mode was unique to the Expedition, though it was discontinued between the 1999-2002 model years. Two High mode was reintroduced on the redesigned second generation Expedition (U222) for the 2003 model year and featured a new full front axle disconnect system with vacuum operated front locking hubs that would disconnect the front axle, front differential, and <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> when not needed for quieter, more fuel-efficient operation on pavement. Ford claimed that the improved Two High mode could help increase fuel economy up to half-a-mile per gallon of gasoline. In Two High mode, torque is routed to the rear drive wheels only, imitating rear-wheel drive.|$|E
50|$|Instead of a {{permanent}} torque split (which is featured in earlier systems), xDrive provides variable torque split between {{the front and rear}} axles {{through the use of a}} multi-plate wet clutch located in the gearbox on the output to the <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> This setup allows xDrive to modulate the torque split between the front and the rear axles, which is normally split at 40:60 ratio, respectively. If wheel slip is detected by the ABS/DSC system, xDrive can react within a tenth of a second to redistribute up to 100% of the engine power to the front or rear axle. The wet clutch is applied through a high speed electric servo motor turning a cam-shaped actuator disc. As the rear drive shaft is hard-coupled to the transmission output, full torque transfer to the front axle can only be achieved if the rear wheels have no traction and are both slipping.|$|E
50|$|Situated {{on top of}} {{the rear}} {{differential}} is a high pressure, low volume electric pump. This pump pressurizes Normal ATF (0-288 psi) into the transfer case to engage the clutch pack. This fluid only engages the clutch pack and does not mix with the NS-ATF lubricating the tranfercase. The higher the fluid pressure the transfer case is supplied with from the pump, the more the clutch pack engages, enabling the torque to the front wheels to be varied. Exiting the transfer case, the <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> runs along {{the right side of the}} transmission, into a differential located on the right of the engines sump. This is a cast aluminum unit, with the sump and front differential made as a single unit that cannot be separated. The front right axle is shorter than the left, because the differential is closer to the right wheel. The front left axle runs through the engine's sump to the left wheel.|$|E
40|$|This project {{presented}} about {{a failure}} of <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> in conventional passenger vehicles. Perodua Kancil <b>front</b> wheel <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> {{was chosen as the}} specimen of this analysis. This project deals with analysis on stress using finite element method. The solid model of the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> need to be constructs using SOLIDWORK software. The type of material used in the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> need to be known first before stress analysis can be performed using Patran-Nastran software. The known material will provide the information such as density, modulus of elasticity and tensile strength required for the software to perform the stress and failure analysis. Spectroscopic analysis is carried out using FOUNDRY-MASTER UV instrument. The load applied at the ends of the shaft that are lateral bending load of 1 / 4 of weight of the full car. Boundary conditions are applied at the bearing and geared location. The highest stress at and displacement was predicted occurred at the fillet cross section location. Stresses will concentrate in the smaller diameter portion due to change in shaft diameter as they pass from large to the small diameter. In any case, one must determine the cause of failure and predict the fatigue life to prevent future occurrence and to improve the performance of the device, component or structure...|$|R
5000|$|Today, the {{designation}} AWD is becoming narrowed, particularly in North America, {{to apply to}} vehicles with drive train systems that have permanent drive and usually include a differential between the <b>front</b> and rear <b>drive</b> <b>shafts.</b> However, {{the designation}}s AWD and all-wheel drive long predated the trend, with Associated Equipment Company (AEC) building AWD trucks in conjunction with FWD (UK) in 1929, and General Motors manufacturing a line as [...] "all-wheel drive" [...] {{as early as the}} late 1930s. This distinction in terminology is not generally used outside North America.|$|R
5000|$|In British English, {{the term}} [...] "drive shaft" [...] is {{restricted}} to a transverse shaft that transmits power to the wheels, especially the <b>front</b> wheels. A <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> connecting the gearbox to a rear differential is called a propeller shaft, or prop-shaft. A prop-shaft assembly consists of a propeller shaft, a slip joint and one or more universal joints. Where the engine and axles are separated from each other, as on four-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive vehicles, it is the propeller shaft that serves to transmit the drive force generated by the engine to the axles.|$|R
50|$|In its {{original}} incarnation launched in 1983, the XJ900 had an air-cooled, double overhead camshaft, 853 cc 4-stroke, 4-cylinder, 8-valve engine. Originally {{fitted with a}} handlebar mounted bikini fairing, its handling came in for criticism. This was quickly replaced with a frame mounted upper fairing and retrofitted to all models. The 1983 XJ900 came with anti-dive <b>front</b> forks, <b>shaft</b> <b>drive</b> and has triple disc brakes (2 front, 1 rear).|$|R
50|$|However, as the {{development}} process continued, engineers at BorgWarner discovered that, with clever software programming, they could control the variable electromagnetic multi-disc clutch {{to a point where}} it would allow the <b>front</b> and rear <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> to turn at different rotational speeds on its own, without the aid of a planetary or bevel geared center differential. In Auto mode the new software algorithms allowed the multi-disc clutch pack's friction and clutch discs to slip as needed, simulating a planetary or bevel geared center differential, making a geared differential redundant. Thus, the geared differential was abandoned and therefore never included on the final production version of the four-wheel drive system.|$|R

40|$|<b>Drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is a {{mechanical}} part of transmission system {{which is used}} to transfer the power from engine to the wheel. It comprises two constant velocity (CV) joints and the actual shaft is almost universally used in <b>front</b> wheel <b>drive</b> (FWD) vehicles. The usage of <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> as a power transmitter in automobile is more convenience because it is less likely to become jammed or broken compared to chain-drives. In operation, <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is generally subjected Torsional and bending stress due to which fatigue and fractural failures may occur. Some common causes of failures are manufacturing, design, maintenance, raw material, and the user originated faults. This paper presents the available literature of failure analysis of <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> and summarized the causes of failures of FWD <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> and analyzes the premature failure in <b>drive</b> <b>shaft...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract : Constant {{velocity}} joint (CVJ) lines of <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> automobiles {{are composed of}} the tripod CVJ or the double offset CVJ, the Rzeppa CVJ and the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> The rotational angle error of the CVJ line and the three dimensional motion of the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> (the whirling motion and the fluctuation of axial direction) were measured and its components were expanded in trigonometric functions. The rotational angle error contains sinusoidal fluctuations with 2 π, 2 π/ 3, 2 π/ 6 periods according to joint angles of Tripod and Rzeppa CVJs. The whirling motion has the period of 2 π/ 3 according to the joint angle of Tripod CVJ. The axial direction motion of the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> contains sinusoidal fluctuations of 2 π, 2 π/ 3 or 2 π/ 6 periods according to joint angles of Tripod and Rzeppa CVJs. Rotation of the output shaft Rzeppa CVJ due to its revolution about the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> was analyzed experimentally and analytically...|$|R

5000|$|In the {{interest}} of simplicity, all models used a friction-drive transmission. A roller (a metal wheel with a rubber surface vulcanized to increase its grip) on the front sprocket shaft was pressed against the machined rear surface of the engine flywheel, thus driving the sprocket <b>shaft,</b> the <b>drive</b> chains and the rear wheels. Moving the shift lever set the drive roller to various positions on the flywheel, either nearer the center or nearer the edge, effectively changing the [...] "gear ratio" [...] for climbing hills or driving on level roads. Moving the roller past the center point spun it backwards to give reverse gear. The <b>front</b> sprocket <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> was free to slide forward and backwards slightly, just enough to allow the roller {{to move away from}} the flywheel. The [...] "clutch pedal" [...] worked differently from most other cars, in that the operator had to hold their foot on the pedal to keep the roller pressed against the flywheel (the catalog claimed that the weight of the operator’s foot was sufficient to provide forward motion). Removing the foot from the pedal allowed the roller to spring back from the flywheel, effectively providing [...] "neutral" [...] so the car could be cranked without moving forwards.|$|R
50|$|Compared to Supermini, Delta had new {{gearboxes}} (made by machinery {{acquired by}} Gurgel from Citroën), <b>front</b> wheel <b>drive</b> (no <b>drive</b> <b>shaft),</b> weighing 550 kg. Just a few prototypes of Gurgel Delta were produced.|$|R
50|$|Constant-velocity joints (AKA homokinetic or CV joints) allow a <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> to {{transmit}} power through a variable angle, at constant rotational speed, without an appreciable increase in friction or play. They are mainly used in <b>front</b> wheel <b>drive</b> vehicles, and many modern {{rear wheel drive}} cars with independent rear suspension typically use CV joints {{at the ends of}} the rear axle halfshafts and increasingly use them on the <b>drive</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{development}} and the experimental testing of a magnetorheological coupling for a 4 WD vehicle are presented. Unlike most of the active devices use multidisc wet clutches as engagement mechanism, this device {{does not have any}} sliding contact and is characterized by an electrical actuation mechanism. The coupling performance is obtained by means of the magnetorheological fluid (MRF), able to change its rheological behaviour when a magnetic field is applied. Therefore the supply current control allows to manage the torque transmitted to the rear <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> So this device can be used to bias the drive torque between the <b>front</b> and rear <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> of a 4 WD vehicle. In particular the magnetorheological fluid (MRF) employment allows to realize an adaptive system able to improve vehicle directional behaviour and traction. An MRF coupling model and its control logic have been developed and are described. The results of the simulations carried on with these models are reported; they have shown the feasibility of this application in terms of torque transmission and biasing. The above simulation models have been implemented in a Software-In-the-Loop (SIL) scheme together with a vehicle dynamics model. The SIL results are reported and they show the MRF coupling effectiveness on the vehicle dynamical behaviour. A test bench has been realized to test an MRF coupling prototype in order to verify the capability to transmit torque...|$|R
5000|$|Four High and Four Low modes {{were also}} {{featured}} on both Explorer and Expedition. Four High mode tells the intelligent locking multi-disc differential to lock, providing a permanently locked 50:50 torque distribution. The <b>front</b> and rear <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> are fully locked, {{forcing them to}} rotate {{at the same speed}} regardless of tractive conditions. Four Low mode also tells the intelligent locking multi-disc differential to lock, however it instructs the BorgWarner transfer case to select low range off road reduction gearing. Reduction gearing is utilized to reduce the vehicle’s speed to a manageable crawl, and to increase (multiply) the supplied torque coming from the engine. Thus the drive wheels have ample torque to move the vehicle at low speeds. It is also used to control downward speeds while descending steep gradients and to improve the vehicle’s off road crawl ratio. Both Four High mode and Four Low mode cannot be used on pavement as [...] "driveline binding" [...] and [...] "torque windup" [...] can occur, causing damage to the four-wheel-drive system.|$|R
