5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects {{with the intention of}} enticing buyers.

Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E

Parchment rolls of the Office of the Works record that De Critz oversaw the decorating of royal houses and palaces.
