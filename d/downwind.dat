5|$|The siting of noxious industries, such as tanning and fulling <b>downwind</b> {{outside the}} {{boundaries}} of the City, and therefore beyond complaints and official controls. The foul-smelling industries partially preferred the East End because the prevailing winds in London traveled from west to east (i.e. it was <b>downwind</b> {{from the rest of the}} city), meaning that most odors from their businesses would not go into the city but outside, and thereby reduced complaints.|$|E
5|$|In South America, the Andes {{mountain}} range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent, {{resulting in a}} desertlike climate just <b>downwind</b> across western Argentina. The Sierra Nevada range creates the same effect in North America forming the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts.|$|E
5|$|The species migrates seasonally, at night, and can {{be carried}} <b>downwind</b> up to 400km. Pupae can make use of {{diapause}} to wait out adverse environmental conditions, especially at high latitudes and in drought.|$|E
5|$|Lake-effect snow is {{produced}} during cooler atmospheric conditions when a {{cold air mass}} moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake, rises up through the colder air above, freezes and is deposited on the leeward (<b>downwind)</b> shores.|$|E
5|$|Monthly {{rainfall}} {{is greater}} <b>downwind</b> of cities, partially {{due to the}} UHI. Increases in heat within urban centers increases the length of growing seasons, and decreases the occurrence of weak tornadoes. The UHI decreases air quality by increasing the production of pollutants such as ozone, and decreases water quality as warmer waters flow into area streams and put stress on their ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|The {{areas of}} highest hazard {{are those that}} could be {{affected}} by pyroclastic flows and lahars (see map). These areas, including Hat Creek Valley, are those {{in the immediate vicinity}} and downhill from likely eruption sites. Fallout of ash will affect areas <b>downwind</b> at the time of an eruption. Within the hazard zones, relative hazard is gradational, decreasing away from the location of potential vents.|$|E
5|$|The {{phenomenon}} underlying global dimming {{may also}} have regional effects. While most of the earth has warmed, the regions that are <b>downwind</b> from major sources of air pollution (specifically sulfur dioxide emissions) have generally cooled. This may explain the cooling of the eastern United States relative to the warming western part.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area. Cold north, northwest, or west winds generally blow across the lake following {{the passage of a}} cold front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation <b>downwind</b> of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E
5|$|Locating prey: The wolves {{travel in}} search of prey through their power of scent, chance encounter, and tracking. Wolves {{typically}} locate their prey by scent, though they must usually be directly <b>downwind</b> of it. When a breeze carrying the prey's scent is located, the wolves stand alert, and point their eyes, ears and nose towards their target. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the wolves head towards their prey.|$|E
5|$|Orographic {{precipitation}} {{occurs on}} the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by}} the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or <b>downwind</b> side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.|$|E
5|$|Soaring {{related to}} wind shear, also called dynamic soaring, is a {{technique}} used by soaring birds like albatrosses, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. If the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can climb into the wind gradient, trading ground speed for height, while maintaining airspeed. By then turning <b>downwind,</b> and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy. It has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurs at}} the termination shock, which is roughly 80–100AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200AU from the Sun <b>downwind.</b> Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath. This structure is thought to look and behave {{very much like a}} comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from Cassini and Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound varies with {{temperature}}. Since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude, sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at {{some distance from the}} source. In the 1862, during the American Civil War Battle of Iuka, an acoustic shadow, believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, because they could not hear the sounds of battle only six miles <b>downwind.</b>|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{then moved}} into Tennessee and {{continued}} south of Huntland. Isolated and minor EF0 to EF1 damage was noted {{through most of}} its path in Tennessee. Widespread damage to trees and outbuildings occurred in this area. The worst damage, however, was to a cinder block utility building and was rated lower-end EF3. Most of its roof was removed, with over half of its <b>downwind</b> wall pushed outward. The tornado eventually dissipated east of Huntland.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} dense cirrus at their tops. As the {{cumulonimbus}} cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze {{when the air}} temperature reaches the freezing point. The anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the flat top. In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches <b>downwind</b> as much as several kilometers.|$|E
5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift <b>downwind.</b> When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E
5|$|Ash fallout occurs {{immediately}} after the eruption and is controlled by particle density. Initially, coarse particles fall out close to source. This is followed by fallout of accretionary lapilli, {{which is the result}} of particle agglomeration within the column. Ash fallout is less concentrated during the final stages as the column moves <b>downwind.</b> This results in an ash fall deposit which generally decreases in thickness and grain size exponentially with increasing distance from the volcano. Fine ash particles may remain in the atmosphere for days to weeks and be dispersed by high-altitude winds. These particles can impact on the aviation industry (refer to impacts section) and, combined with gas particles, can affect global climate.|$|E
5|$|Barchans or {{crescent}} dunes {{are produced}} by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the slip face point <b>downwind.</b> Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the angle of repose of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand avalanches, which is a nonlinear behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then {{the addition of a}} further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche. Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like solitary waves.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a pass in the {{mountain}} range, winds will rush through the pass with considerable speed because of the Bernoulli principle that describes an inverse relationship between speed and pressure. The airflow can remain turbulent and erratic for some distance <b>downwind</b> into the flatter countryside. These conditions are dangerous to ascending and descending airplanes. Cool winds accelerating through mountain gaps have been given regional names. In Central America, examples include the Papagayo wind, the Panama wind, and the Tehuano wind. In Europe, similar winds are known as the Bora, Tramontane, and Mistral. When these winds blow over open waters, they increase mixing of the upper layers of the ocean that elevates cool, nutrient rich waters to the surface, which leads to increased marine life.|$|E
5|$|In arid climates, {{the main}} source of erosion is wind. The general wind {{circulation}} moves small particulates such as dust across wide oceans thousands of kilometers <b>downwind</b> of their point of origin, which is known as deflation. Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for {{a large percentage of the}} biomass of land plants.|$|E
5|$|More violent eruptions are {{possible}} only in unique circumstances, {{such as an}} eruption into a lake. Any future eruption {{is most likely to}} affect only a limited area downslope from the volcano. Poisonous substances, such as volcanic gas, includes a variety of substances. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissoclated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution <b>downwind</b> from the volcano.|$|E
5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form <b>downwind</b> of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when {{topographic}} and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly {{across the surface of the}} ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E
5|$|Simpson {{was killed}} on 9 May 2013, during {{training}} for the 34th America's Cup, when the Swedish Artemis Racing team yacht he was aboard capsized near Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay. The yacht, a 72-foot catamaran with a rigid, wing-like sail, was turning <b>downwind</b> and bearing away when it flipped over and broke into pieces. Simpson was trapped underneath its hulls for approximately ten minutes, and attempts to revive him by doctors afloat and subsequently ashore were unsuccessful. The cause of the accident is unknown. An investigation was initiated by the United States Coast Guard which involved San Francisco police and the America's Cup management.|$|E
5|$|Termites are {{relatively}} poor fliers and are readily blown <b>downwind</b> in wind speeds {{of less than}} 2km/h, shedding their wings soon after landing at an acceptable site, where they mate and attempt to form a nest in damp timber or earth. Wings of most termites have three heavy veins along the basal part of {{the front edge of}} the forewing and the crossveins near the wing tip are angled, making trapezoidal cells. Although subterranean termite wings have just two major veins along the front edge of the forewing and the cross veins towards the wingtip are perpendicular to these veins, making square and rectangular cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} half of Africa {{is occupied}} by the world's most extensive hot, dry region, the Sahara Desert. Some deserts are also occupying much of southern Africa : the Namib and the Kalahari. Across Asia, a large annual rainfall minimum, composed primarily of deserts, stretches from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia west-southwest through western Pakistan (Balochistan) and Iran into the Arabian Desert in Saudi Arabia. Most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, making it the world's driest inhabited continent. In South America, the Andes mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desertlike climate just <b>downwind</b> across western Argentina. The drier areas of the United States are regions where the Sonoran Desert overspreads the Desert Southwest, the Great Basin and central Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of {{thunderstorm}} development. Mature thunderstorms are found near the center of the cluster, while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their <b>downwind</b> side. Multicell storms form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines. While each cell of the cluster may only last 20minutes, the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time. They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure. These type of storms are stronger than the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm. Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail, flash flooding, and weak tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic gas {{includes}} {{a variety of}} substances. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissociated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution <b>downwind</b> from the volcano. Globally, large explosive eruptions that inject a tremendous volume of sulfur aerosols into the stratosphere can lead to lower surface temperatures and promote weakening of the Earth's ozone layer. Because carbon dioxide gas is heavier than air, the gas may flow into low-lying areas and collect in the soil. The concentration of carbon dioxide gas in these areas can be lethal to people, animals, and vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, {{scientists}} with the U.S. Public Health Service published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, {{and there were}} protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. In response to {{an article in the}} Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations. The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived <b>downwind</b> from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases. A mass tort lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years. Two of six plaintiffs who went to trial in 2005 were awarded $500,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|During mid-summer (July in the {{northern}} hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads {{to an increase in}} red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances <b>downwind,</b> or eastward, into North America.|$|E
5|$|It {{was normal}} in fleet {{actions of the}} 18th century for the two lines of battle to pass one another sedately, exchanging fire at long ranges and then wearing away, often without either side losing a ship or taking an enemy. In contrast, Howe was {{counting}} on the professionalism of his captains and crews combined with {{the advantage of the}} weather gage to attack the French directly, driving through their line. However, this time he did not plan to manoeuvre in the way he had during the two previous encounters; each ship following in the wake of that in front to create a new line arrowing through his opponent's force (as Rodney had done at the Battle of the Saintes 12years earlier). Instead, Howe ordered each of his ships to turn individually towards the French line, intending to breach it at every point and rake the French ships at both bow and stern. The British captains would then pull up on the leeward side of their opposite numbers, cutting them off from their retreat <b>downwind,</b> and engage them directly, hopefully forcing each to surrender and consequently destroying the French Atlantic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Patterns {{can form}} {{for other reasons}} in the vegetated {{landscape}} of tiger bush and fir waves. Tiger bush stripes occur on arid slopes where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it. Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn {{more likely to be}} damaged, so gaps tend to expand <b>downwind.</b> Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees. Natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals, as in the Mima mounds of the Northwestern United States and some other areas, which appear to be created over many years by the burrowing activities of pocket gophers, while the so-called fairy circles of Namibia appear to be created by the interaction of competing groups of sand termites, along with competition for water among the desert plants.|$|E
5|$|Several {{communities}} in Baker County were devastated, leaving seven people dead, {{as many as}} 100 injured, and hundreds destitute. The county sheriff estimated that merely a dozen houses out of a thousand survived the storm, that thousands of cows were killed, and that {{hundreds of thousands of}} trees were toppled. Not one church or school was left standing in the county, and damage there was estimated at $250,000. Eight people were killed in Suwannee County, including two children crushed by the collapse of their home near Wellborn. In Columbia County, dozens of buildings suffered near or total destruction, while nine people were killed. One woman lost her life in Grady, a small settlement in Lafayette County. Additionally, there were five fatalities in Bradford County, including one man reportedly struck by flying bricks that were lofted nearly a half mile <b>downwind.</b> Strong winds and heavy rainfall affected areas as far southeast as St. Augustine. In Fernandina Beach, the hurricane toppled oak trees and destroyed buildings. Although wind gusts in Jacksonville reached , the effects were generally insignificant.|$|E
5|$|The 1941 VFL season {{went ahead}} despite {{the loss of}} many players to {{military}} service. Miller alternated between playing in the backline and in attack depending on match conditions. When St Kilda were kicking <b>downwind,</b> Miller would play in attack, and when they kicked against the wind, {{he would return to}} a defensive position. In the forward line, he alternated with Sam Loxton, a future Invincibles teammate. He booted 28 goals in 16 games, including eight in one match against North Melbourne. Miller also gained a reputation among opponents for kicking them in the ankles. He again showed his disrespect for authority and reputation. In one match against Melbourne, for whom his boss and state cricket teammate Percy Beames played, Miller charged towards Beames with a raised elbow {{at the start of the}} match, forcing his boss to be taken from the field. Miller came second in St Kilda's best and fairest for 1941 as his team again came second to last.|$|E
5|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} {{into a very}} high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn <b>downwind.</b> Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled {{a few inches from}} its original location, and notable scouring of lawn grass was observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200mph (320km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations and there is some speculation that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity at this point, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:30am on Thursday, 25 February, Gothenburg {{continued}} to heel over. The deck became so steep that {{passengers and crew}} had to climb over the rails to get on her side. At about 4:00am, the two remaining starboard lifeboats were lowered and were rushed by the passengers. One starboard lifeboat, crammed with women and children, capsized when others tried to board it. Some half dozen men righted her in the water, but, damaged and without oars, food or water, it quickly drifted away and was never found. The second starboard lifeboat also capsized when the sea crashed over, washing all the occupants into the sea. One passenger recalled the sea on the <b>downwind</b> {{side of the ship}} being covered with human heads bobbing up and down like corks. Five or six men and one woman climbed onto the upturned hull. The boat was still connected to its painter, but it was unable to be recovered from the heavy sea and wind which swept the woman off and drowned her. A passenger, John Cleland, swam to the connected, but upturned lifeboat and further secured it with a rope tied to Gothenburg. In less than fifteen minutes, nearly 100 people had drowned; washed away or trapped in their water-filled cabins. By this time, several sharks were circling the wreck.|$|E
5|$|The United States has {{the most}} tornadoes of any country, nearly four times more than {{estimated}} in all of Europe, excluding waterspouts. This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a large continent that extends from the tropics north into arctic areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the middle latitudes, where most tornadoes of the world occur, the Rocky Mountains block moisture and buckle the atmospheric flow, forcing drier air at mid-levels of the troposphere due to downsloped winds, and causing {{the formation of a}} low pressure area <b>downwind</b> to the east of the mountains. Increased westerly flow off the Rockies force the formation of a dry line when the flow aloft is strong, while the Gulf of Mexico fuels abundant low-level moisture in the southerly flow to its east. This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms throughout the year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the central United States known as Tornado Alley. This area extends into Canada, particularly Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, although southeast Quebec, the interior of British Columbia, and western New Brunswick are also tornado-prone. Tornadoes also occur across northeastern Mexico.|$|E
