2500|$|The Lust for Life {{sessions}} {{took place}} {{soon after the}} completion of a concert tour in support of The Idiot album, the tour ending on 16 April 1977. Pop has stated, [...] "David and I had determined that we would record that album very quickly, which we wrote, recorded, and mixed in eight days, and because we had done it so quickly, {{we had a lot of}} money left over from the advance, which we split." [...] The singer slept little during its making, commenting [...] "See, Bowie's a hell of a fast guy... <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to be quicker than him, otherwise whose album was it gonna be?" [...] Pop's spontaneous lyrical method inspired Bowie to improvise his own words on his next project, [...] "Heroes".|$|E
2500|$|When {{the series}} {{lengthened}} from a half-hour {{to an hour}} in 1980, multiple cast members who portrayed characters from the original core families departed because their contracts only bound them to performing in a half-hour show. A number of the characters were recast until {{one of the few}} remaining original actors, Jaime Lyn Bauer, who portrayed Lorie Brooks, decided to leave. When she announced her intention not to renew her contract, Bell decided to replace the original core families. [...] "As I studied the remaining cast, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> two characters- Paul Williams, played by Doug Davidson, and Jack Abbott, played by Terry Lester- both of whom had a relatively insignificant presence on the show," [...] Bell said. [...] "They didn't have families. Hell, they didn't even have bedrooms. But these became the two characters I would build our two families around." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his search}} for radio work {{following}} his graduation, Stern declined an offer to work evenings at WRNW, a progressive rock station in Briarcliff Manor, New York. He stopped and was unsure of his talent and questioned his future as a professional in the industry, writing [...] "I freaked out. I got real nervous that I wasn't good enough". Stern accepted a marketing role at Benton & Bowles, a New York advertising agency, which he soon [...] "quit without giving notice" [...] {{in favor of a}} position in the creative department. He lasted three hours before he was fired [...] "because their personnel department realized that I was the guy who just quit." [...] Stern then worked in Queens as a radio salesman selling advertising time without considerable success. He wrote, [...] "All of a sudden ... <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> turned down a job in radio". With encouragement from his mother and girlfriend, Stern contacted WRNW for work and agreed to take cover shifts surrounding the Christmas holidays in 1976. Impressed with his reliability and professional approach, the station's director hired Stern full-time for a four-hour midday shift for six days a week, for $96 a week. After several months, Stern became the station's production director which lasted until November 1977 when he became its program director for an increased salary of $250 a week. To save money, Stern rented a room in a monastery in Armonk, New York.|$|E

2500|$|ABC {{required}} Wallenda to wear {{a safety}} harness for the walk. After {{the decision was made}} in mid-May, a spokesperson for ABC explained: [...] "We had always made clear from the beginning that significant safety precautions would need to be taken. This is the outcome of that." [...] Wallenda was not happy about the decision, stating [...] "It's disheartening—I wanted to do it without anything." [...] The Niagara Parks Commission indicated it was unaware of such a requirement when they were considering approval. [...] During the walk, Wallenda told his dad that he felt [...] "like a jackass" [...] wearing the harness. Many observers predicted he would remove the harness partway through the walk, but ultimately he did not do so. Before the crossing, Wallenda had promised that he only would remove the harness if it became a hazard during the walk. [...] "When I first found out about it, {{there was no doubt in}} my mind I was going to take it off", he later said. [...] "But as [...] got closer and closer, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to honor my word. I've always said I'm a man of integrity." [...] He also acknowledged that removing the harness would have created contractual problems with ABC. [...] "The way a TV network works, if something goes wrong, they fire people," [...] he said. [...] "If I would have dropped that tether, four people would have been fired because I'm too selfish to care or because it's all about me." [...] In addition to the harness, Wallenda wore a waterproof track suit and shoes custom made by his mother for the walk. Part moccasin, part ballet shoe, the shoes were designed to get a good grip when wet.|$|E

Here was my ordeal. Was it to be as terrible as Steele's had been? I thought it would be, and I swore by all that was rising grim and cold in me that I would be strong. Sally gave a little cry that cut like a blade in my heart, and then she was close-pressed upon me, her quivering breast beating against mine, her eyes, dark as night now, searching my soul.|$|E
