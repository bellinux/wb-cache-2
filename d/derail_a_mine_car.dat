50|$|The {{attraction}} is designed around {{the theme of}} an expedition to the lost Temple of Peril. The queue wanders through an abandoned base camp, meandering toward the temple where guests climb a staircase to the temple entrance. Inside the temple, guests board <b>a</b> <b>mine</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R
50|$|Continued {{emphasis}} on improving productivity {{in the mines}} {{led to the development}} of the first automatic, power-driven grease gun to be marketed commercially. Used for lubricating the <b>mine</b> <b>cars,</b> the unit included a 400 Lb pressurized tank, one or more hoses and valves that automatically dispensed a predetermined amount of grease. The first Lincoln Lubrigun, introduced in 1923, was mounted on <b>a</b> <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> truck.|$|R
50|$|The second {{disaster}} {{resulted from}} <b>a</b> <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> accidentally running over some loose explosives. This, {{coupled with a}} failure to damp the coal dust, resulted in a large explosion that killed 13. The next day, on March 19, 11 rescue workers then entered the area, and a second explosion occurred killing them all.|$|R
50|$|The other mines {{remained}} productive {{after the}} disaster in Mine No. 2. Then, on February 8, 1923, Stag Canyon Mine No. 1 suffered <b>an</b> explosion. <b>A</b> <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> <b>derailed,</b> knocking down timbers and the electric trolley cable causing sparks, igniting coal {{dust in the}} mine. 123 men were killed in this explosion, many of them offspring {{of the men who}} died in 1913.|$|R
5000|$|Tipples were {{initially}} used with minecarts, also called tubs or tram <b>cars,</b> or <b>mine</b> <b>cars</b> in the U.S. These were small hopper cars {{that carried the}} product on <b>a</b> <b>mine</b> railway out of the <b>mine.</b> When <b>a</b> <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> entered the upper level of the tipple, its contents were dumped through a chute leading to a railroad hopper car positioned on a track running beneath the tipple. At some facilities, each car was tipped over manually—thus the name, [...] "tipple". In higher volume facilities, each car {{was placed in a}} machine called a rotary dump, which rotated the car to dump the coal.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2014, Disney Publishing Worldwide {{released}} [...] "The 7D <b>Mine</b> Train App", <b>an</b> endless-runner {{video game}} where the player chooses {{one of the}} redesigned 7D dwarfs as their game avatar to pilot <b>a</b> <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> through various levels of the mine, picking up gems. It is loosely associated with the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train attraction at Walt Disney World which opened in May 2014.|$|R
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with the theatrical release of Temple of Doom in 1984, TSR, Inc. released miniature metal versions of twelve characters from both films for a role playing game. LJN Toys Ltd. also released action figures of Jones, Mola Ram, and the Giant Thugee; there were plans for the addition of Willie Scott and Short Round, and also <b>a</b> <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> racing set, but these were never made available.|$|R
50|$|After Wednesday, January 1, 1947 (Vesting Day) {{a policy}} of {{modernisation}} took place throughout the whole mining industry. In 1952 <b>mine</b> <b>cars</b> and locomotive haulage were introduced underground at Whitfield and <b>a</b> new <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> circuit installed on the surface. The building to accommodate this is still standing.|$|R
25|$|Several early {{concepts}} {{were considered}} including a walk-through adventure and <b>a</b> high-speed <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> adventure within <b>a</b> temple. To avoid a long queue, Imagineers considered using Jungle Cruise launches to shuttle guests to the loading area.|$|R
50|$|The Lackawanna Coal Mine Tour {{is located}} {{in the heart of the}} park. The hour-long tour takes you to <b>a</b> <b>mine</b> that was {{originally}} part of the Continental Coal Mine which was once an active anthracite coal <b>mine.</b> Visitors take <b>a</b> <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> 300 ft underground into the shaft and then walk the tour, totaling about a quarter of <b>a</b> mile. The <b>mine</b> temperature is often significant different than the outside temperature (approximately , year round). Tour dates are seven days a week from April 1 to November 30, closing only for Thanksgiving Day and Easter Sunday. Admission is charged for the tour.|$|R
5000|$|Other thrill {{rides in}} Canobie Lake Park include Starblaster, an S&S Double Shot. The Starblaster was opened in 2002, {{replacing}} the Moon Orbiter. The park {{also features a}} rotor ride named [...] "Turkish Twist", and a shoot-the-chutes ride named [...] "The Boston Tea Party". Canobie {{has one of the}} few dark rides in New England, named [...] "Mine of Lost Souls". Passengers board <b>a</b> <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> and are transported into the depths of <b>a</b> dark <b>mine,</b> which begins to collapse. Another flat ride at Canobie is the [...] "Psychodrome", a 12-car Scrambler ride located in a dome, with lighting, music and special effects.|$|R
50|$|The ride {{itself has}} been open since the mid-1980s as <b>a</b> <b>mine</b> like <b>car</b> ride with no hills or wooden tracks. The {{original}} ride's opening was delayed {{for a long time}} before officially opening in the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{force of}} the {{explosion}} was powerful enough to launch <b>a</b> <b>mining</b> <b>car,</b> telephone poles, and other equipment across the canyon, a distance of nearly {{a mile from the}} entrance to the mine. [...] The steel gates of the mine were ripped from their concrete foundations. Inside the mine, rails were twisted, roof supports were destroyed, afterdamp and coal dust filled the air, and the lamps of the surviving miners were blown out. As these men attempted to relight their lamps, a second explosion was sparked, killing the remainder of the workers in the <b>mine.</b> <b>A</b> third explosion occurred approximately 20 minutes later, causing a destructive cave-in.|$|R

50|$|Hunt's Pier {{featured}} many unique {{rides and}} attractions, including a classic wooden roller coaster called the Flyer, indoor rides such as Keystone Kops and Whacky Shack, and an outdoor boat ride called Jungleland. For many years, The Golden Nugget had {{the honor of}} being the oldest ride on the Wildwood Boardwalk still surviving in its original form and location. The Golden Nugget originally opened in July 1960 on the newly constructed oceanside section of Hunt’s Pier. The Golden Nugget was built three stories high with the top floor designed to imitate <b>a</b> <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> ride through the desert. The classic coaster ride was specially constructed for Hunt’s Pier by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company and was engineered by John Allen. It was removed in 2009, and a ceremony commemorating the ride was held in January of that year in anticipation of its removal.|$|R
25|$|The queue begins outside, winding past a 2.5 ton Mercedes-Benz troop {{transport}} truck. This is {{the actual}} vehicle used in the desert chase scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark. <b>A</b> small <b>mining</b> <b>car</b> near the truck is a movie prop as well, used in the mine scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Guests also walk by a noisy steam-powered engine/generator set piece, which appears to power the lights strung deep into the temple.|$|R
50|$|The Golden Nugget Mine Ride {{opened in}} July 1960 at Morey's Piers on the newly {{constructed}} ocean side section of Hunt's Pier. The Golden Nugget was built three stories high {{with the top}} floor giving riders <b>a</b> <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> ride through the “desert.” The coaster was specially constructed for Hunt’s Pier by the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters and was engineered by John C. Allen. Bill Tracy designed the ride’s western theme pieces through his Amusement Display company.On December 11, 2008, Morey's Piers announced that the Golden Nugget would be demolished {{and that they would}} have a ceremony for the Golden Nugget on Saturday, January 31. On Jan 26, 2009 it was publicly announced that Knoebels' Amusement Resort had purchased the Golden Nugget track and trains from Morey's Piers. The Coaster was modified and rebuilt on the location where the park's former bald eagle habitat resides. The eagle's habitat has been relocated. The Black Diamond has opened and is currently working as of October 8, 2011.|$|R
50|$|While {{travelling}} to a subterranean base, Ben and Nelani, a Jedi Knight, {{are forced}} out of <b>a</b> <b>mining</b> <b>car.</b> Their guide, Brisha Syo creates a dark side phantom of Luke Skywalker, who attacks and very nearly kills Jacen. Eventually, Brisha stops the projections and takes Jacen to an office, where Darth Vectivus, the supposed Sith Lord they are hunting, lives. After fighting Force projections with Ben, Nelani catches up with them. Brisha is revealed to be Lumiya, the Dark Lady of the Sith. She reveals that Vergere is a Sith apprentice, and that Jacen has already received Sith training. Lumiya says that Jacen {{is going to become}} the next Sith Lord. Unsure of his next move, Jacen uses the Force to create visions of the future. In each vision in which Lumiya is arrested, the galaxy is consumed in an endless war that eventually places Jacen against Luke. In the vision, Jacen kills his uncle.|$|R

50|$|The Lackawanna Coal <b>Mine</b> is <b>a</b> {{museum and}} retired coal mine located in McDade Park in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Visitors board <b>a</b> <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> and descend the #190 slope into the Clark Vein of coal. At {{the foot of}} the shaft the {{visitors}} begin an hour-long guided tour through the main gangway of the mine and stop at various points to discuss different aspects of the anthracite mining industry. Visitors then leave the Clark Vein via a rock tunnel and stop in the Dunmore #1 Vein. Once in the Dunmore #1, transportation and <b>mining</b> in <b>a</b> fault room are discussed. As the tour continues down the rock tunnel the group stops at the peg shanty to meet the fire boss and discuss his role in mining operations. The tour then continues on to the Dunmore #2 Vein and discusses working in small veins of coal, air doors and their role in ventilation, door boys or nippers, second means of exit from the mine and company store. The tour concludes where the miners ended their final days within the mine in November 1966.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} single track, constructed of 16-pound rails (previously used in <b>a</b> <b>mine).</b> The <b>cars</b> used were horse drawn. In 1900, {{the line was}} electrified and upgraded. The rails were replaced with 36-pound rails and a passing section was added at 19th Street and Chester Avenue. The car barn was constructed at 19th Street and Union Avenue. In 1903, four additional lines were added. This resulted in {{a large number of}} switches being added, including the T-crossing at 19th Street and Chester Avenue.|$|R

The words [...] "Find the Book" [...] are scrawled over the walls. <b>As</b> the <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> turns, riders see Evelyn's {{supervisor}} trapped on a table, who tells the riders: [...] "Find the Book of the Living and kill Imhotep! It's your only hope!". Standing next to him is Imhotep, who then turns towards riders and sucks out the supervisor's soul. He is holding onto the Book of the Dead. Imhotep's voice echoes throughout the tomb when he warns riders that they will never find the other book and he will rule for all eternity with their souls. Outlines of the Book of the Living, on the walls at the left, glow in red. Almost identical to the Orlando version, the vehicle next move into a room with treasure all over. Imhotep appears from the sand in a tomb mural ahead and tempts riders with [...] "Serve me and savor riches beyond measure". Light appears across the room, revealing treasure around the room. Imhotep also sternly states, [...] "or refuse, and savor a more bitter treasure!", and utters an Egyptian curse: [...] "Akudei makrraken ra!!".|$|R

40|$|Muck {{conveyors}} are {{a potential}} source of airborne dust. Muck from the excavated face, which is usually fairly wet when placed on the conveyor, dries out as it travels on the conveyor through the airstream. Water sprays placed at intervals along the conveyor will minimize dust from the conveyor contaminating the airstream. Conveyor transfer and drop points should be enclosed and provided with water sprays. Scraper and spray wash will wash return belts and idlers. 7. 5. 11 Airways, Haulage Ways, <b>Mine</b> <b>Cars</b> and Dumping Stations a) Airways and rail haulage ways Cleaning the walls and floors of airways and rail haulage ways, by periodically washing down or vacuuming, will remove many potential dust sources. Concrete lined openings facilitate cleaning. Residual dust and dirt {{should not be allowed}} to accumulate in the airways and haulage ways as these represent potential dust sources. b) <b>Mine</b> <b>cars</b> Keeping the muck in the <b>mine</b> <b>cars</b> wet reduces the potential for creating dust. Overloading cars must be avoided as it can lead to spillage which then becomes another potential dust source. Washing <b>mine</b> <b>cars</b> regularly will keep them free of dirt and dust, and parking <b>a</b> loaded <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> for <b>a</b> long periods should be avoided as this allows the muck to dry out. If feasible, major route of <b>mine</b> <b>cars</b> should not be along primary intake airways. c) Dumping Stations Subsurface muck car dumping stations represent major potential dust sources. Enclosure and bypass airways can be installed to avoid high velocity air/dust contact. Water spray at dump activated during dumping will wet the muck and suppress dust. Local dust scrubbers located at the dumps will clean dusty air that escapes from the dump station enclosures. Choice of location and equipment for dump stations must prioritize dust control. 7. 5. 12 Leakage and Recirculation of Contaminated Air from Exhaust Ducts Leakage from exhaust ducts containing contaminated air and subsequent recirculation of the leakage contributes to dust problems.
