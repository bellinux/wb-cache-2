40|$|One of {{the steps}} during the {{authorization}} process of plant protection products (PPP) in the European Union is to evaluate {{the safety of the}} operator. For this purpose, information on the probable levels of operator exposure during the proposed uses of the PPP is required. These levels can be estimated by using existing mathematical models or from field study data. However, the existing models have several shortcomings, including the lack of data for operator exposure levels during spray applications by <b>hand</b> <b>lance,</b> especially in greenhouses. The present study monitored the potential dermal and inhalation operator exposure from hand-held lance applications of malathion on greenhouse tomatoes at low and high spraying pressures. The methodology for monitoring potential exposure was based on the whole body dosimetry method. Inhalation exposure was monitored using personal air pumps and XAD- 2 sampling tubes. For the monitoring of hand exposure, cotton gloves were used in two trials and rubber gloves in another three. The total volumes of spray solution contaminating the body of the operator were 25. 37 and 35. 83 ml/h, corresponding to 0. 05 and 0. 07 % of the applied spray solu-tion, respectively, in the case of low pressure knapsack applications and from 160. 76 to 283. 45 ml/h, corresponding to 0. 09 – 0. 19 % of the spray solution applied, in the case of han...|$|E

During the match, the Macedonian threw his lance, which Dioxippus dodged. Then, before Coragus could transfer his pike to his right hand, Dioxippus attacked, shattering the weapon with his club. The Macedonian attempted to draw his sword, but Dioxippus wrestled him, getting double underhooks or as Rufus described as a [...] "bear hug", or a bodylock, swept him to the ground, disarmed him and immobilized him. He then stepped on Coragus' throat and could have killed him, but Alexander stopped the fight at this point.|$|R

40|$|Malathion {{was applied}} to roses in three Finnish {{greenhouses}} by <b>hand</b> held <b>lance</b> sprayers. The potential dermal exposure of applicators to this insecticide was measured. Total urine production of each applicator was also collected up to 24 h post application. In the urine samples the specific metabolite of malathion, malathion monocarboxylic acid (MMA), and the creatinine content were determined. The potential dermal exposure results show that during the application of malathion, the applicators' lower limbs accounted, on average, for 48 %, while the upper limbs accounted for 19 % of the potential dermal exposure. Moreover, hands and chest and back and head regions accounted for 30 and 3 %, respectively. Based on the urine measurements, {{it was observed that}} the excretion of MMA was very rapid reaching a maximum at about 6 - 7 h after the completion of the application. In the urine samples collected, MMA was found to be present in relatively small amounts. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
