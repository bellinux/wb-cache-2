5|$|Billed as {{the next}} Sandy Koufax, Clyde had a stellar high school career at Westchester High School. He was drafted with the first overall pick in the 1973 Major League Baseball draft. The Rangers planned to have Clyde pitch his first two {{professional}} games {{in the major leagues}} before moving <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> minor leagues, but Rangers owner Bob Short decided to keep him in the roster for monetary purposes, where he had a 5.01 earned run average in 18 starts. Journalists criticized the Rangers for promoting Clyde too soon, and after an uneventful 1974 campaign, he developed shoulder trouble and was sent down to the minor leagues in 1975, where he pitched three seasons. He was traded to the Cleveland Indians in 1978, and played two seasons before being demoted. Clyde attempted to make a comeback with the Houston Astros but was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The WWF World Heavyweight Championship match came next, as Hulk Hogan {{defended his}} title against Yokozuna. Yokozuna {{controlled}} {{the beginning of}} the match until he ran at Hogan in the corner but missed an avalanche splash. Hogan tried twice to body slam Yokozuna but could not pick him up. Yokozuna performed a bear hug on Hogan and tried to pin him after executing a belly to belly suplex. Hogan kicked Yokozuna in the face three times and knocked <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mat. He performed a leg drop, his signature move, on Yokozuna but was unable to pin him. As Hogan prepared to attempt to body slam Yokozuna, manager Harvey Wippleman, disguised as a planted photographer, jumped up onto the edge of the ring. His camera exploded in Hogan's face, which allowed Yokozuna to knock Hogan down and perform a leg drop. Yokozuna pinned Hogan to regain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and performed a Banzai drop on Hogan after the match.|$|E

5|$|McLaughlin {{split the}} 1978 season between {{the major leagues}} and minors. McLaughlin made his season debut with Seattle on April 25, against the California Angels. In that game, which also marked his first MLB start, McLaughlin gave up three runs (all earned) and struck out 10 in six innings pitched. He came away with the loss, which was his first MLB decision. In late June the Mariners sent <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> minor leagues. With the San Jose Missions, who were the Mariners Triple-A {{affiliate}} at the time, he went 5–2 with a 3.50 ERA, and 52 strikeouts in eight games, all starts. Two of those starts were complete games. McLaughlin was called {{back up to the}} majors in July after pitcher John Montague was placed on the disabled list. McLaughlin's first major league win came on August 16, against the Baltimore Orioles. In the majors that season, McLaughlin went 4–8 with a 4.37 ERA and 87 strikeouts in 20 games, 17 starts. Four of his starts were complete games. After the 1978 season, McLaughlin pitched in the Mexican Pacific League, where he led all pitchers with a 1.05 ERA and 143 strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|Snow and the Huntsman walk {{together}} in the forest, and she sees through his disguise and correctly guesses that he was sent by the Queen to kill her. Snow flees, but as the Huntsman catches up with her, he finds her writing a letter, which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed. The Huntsman takes out his knife, but instead of killing her, he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick, telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run. The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart, hoping that she will not know the difference. The queen asks him to read her the letter, which is an apology for past wrongs {{as well as a}} request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion. The queen burns the letter and takes the box with the heart in it to store in her vault. When she cannot open one of her storage safes, it proves that the Huntsman lied to her; the heart is not human. The Queen has her guards drag <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vault and she yanks his glowing heart out of his body. She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet and will do her bidding forever, and if he ever betrays her, all she has to do is squeeze.|$|E

Poirot and guests go to his study and find him there dead, having apparently shot himself. Poirot is not convinced, however, and soon starts to prove that Sir Gervase was murdered because of various improbable factors surrounding the death, including the position at which the bullet is believed to have struck a mirror and the many different moods that Chevenix-Gore exhibited during the day.|$|E

25|$|Later that summer, a {{well known}} gambler from the Skeena River was aboard, {{and he spoke}} to Captain Bucey about the {{possibility}} of having a poker game on one of the lower decks. The gambler promised it would not only occupy the players, but some spectators as well. Bucey was agreeable to the idea and gave his consent. Although gambling on sternwheelers that held liquor licenses was illegal, it was also a long and much-loved tradition. The game started off modestly enough, but soon huge sums were being wagered, and some large jackpots were being won. Present {{since the start of the}} game was a stranger, who was a provincial policeman who was being transferred to a new post by the constable at Fort George. Several hours into play, and when the table was covered with a drift of bills, this man abruptly announced his identity, declared the game illegal and confiscated all the money. The players and other spectators were outraged and immediately turned into an angry mob. The Skeena River gambler jumped to the policeman's defense and let the man return to his stateroom while he tried to mollify the angry men. After promising to refund any losses, the gambler went to speak to Captain Bucey to see what could be done about the matter. Bucey thought for a moment and then suggested to the gambler that he go talk to the policeman and suggest that if he let the game continue, he can keep half the money he took. The gambler did so, and was surprised when the policeman accepted the bribe. Upon hearing of the policeman's decision, Bucey had his first mate take over at the wheel, and accompanied by two deckhands, he went to the policeman's stateroom and took <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower deck where the game had started again. Once there he told everyone how the policeman had tried to steal their money, but he assured everyone that he had complete control of his own ship, and that this incident would be reported to the magistrate at Fort George, and that the crooked policeman would be on the next steamer south. The bribe was surrendered, and the game continued unhampered. Captain Bucey had won the respect of his passengers, and their friendship.|$|E
25|$|Since their {{formation}} in December 2007, Los Psycho Circus (Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown) had not lost a single match, with AAA claiming that their win streak had reached over 600 victories. During {{the fall of}} 2010, Los Psycho Circus were engulfed in a war with the many variations of Los Perros del Mal, with Damián 666, Halloween and the group's leader El Hijo del Perro Aguayo being the most prominent Perros during the feud. After several matches {{between the two groups}} went to either a no contest or a countout, they were booked to face each other on December 5 at Guerra de Titanes in a steel cage weapons match, where Los Perros del Mal was represented by Damián 666, Halloween and X-Fly. In the end of the match, Halloween and Murder Clown were left in the cage, when someone wearing a Monster Clown mask ran out, climbed up the cage and prevented Murder Clown from escaping the cage, dropping <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mat and allowing Halloween to escape the cage, handing Los Psycho Circus their first ever loss. After the match, the man unmasked himself to reveal El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, who had been sidelined in October with a knee injury with reports stating {{that he would have to}} stay out of the ring for the rest of the year. The feud between the two groups continued at March's Rey de Reyes, where Los Perros del Mal, represented by Aguayo, Damián 666, Halloween and Super Crazy, was once again victorious in a match against Los Psycho Circus and Dr. Wagner Jr., the alliance known as Potencia Mundial ("World Power"). The feud also spread out to independent promotions International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) and Perros del Mal Producciones (PdM); in IWRG, the groups feuded over the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship, which Los Psycho Circus successfully defended against Los Perros, while in PdM, the two groups faced each other in a Masks vs. Hairs steel cage match, which ended with Super Crazy having his hair head shaved off. In May 2011, AAA announced that the promotion was going to crown their first ever World Trios Champions and started a tournament with the finals being held at Triplemanía XIX. Los Psycho Circus advanced to the finals by defeating La Maniarquía (Chessman, Silver King and Último Gladiador) and The Black Family (Dark Cuervo, Dark Espíritu and Dark Ozz), while Los Perros del Mal advanced by defeating Real Fuerza Aérea (Aero Star, Argenis and Laredo Kid) and Los Bizarros (Charly Manson, Cibernético and Escoria) to set up a grudge match for the AAA World Trios Championship at Triplemanía XIX.|$|E

500|$|Trapped against Shannon at {{an angle}} in which few of her guns could fire on the British ship, and unable to {{manoeuvre}} away, Chesapeakes stern now became exposed and was swept by raking fire. Earlier in the action Shannons gunnery had devastated Chesapeakes forward gun crews; this destruction was now inflicted on the gun crews in the aft part of the ship. The American ship's situation worsened when a small open cask of musket cartridges abaft the mizzen-mast blew up. When the smoke cleared, Broke judged {{the time was right}} and gave the order to board. Captain Lawrence also gave the order to board, but the frightened bugler aboard Chesapeake, William Brown, failed to sound the call, and only those near Lawrence heard his command. By this time Lawrence was the only officer left on the upper deck, as Lieutenants Ludlow and Ballard had been wounded. Lieutenant Cox, who had brought up men from the lower deck to form a boarding party, reached the quarterdeck only to find that his captain had been badly, indeed mortally, wounded by a musket ball. Lawrence was clinging to the binnacle in order to stay upright; Cox, who had served all his sea life with Lawrence, carried <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cockpit with the help of two sailors. As he was being taken down Lawrence called out [...] "Tell the men to fire faster! Don't give up the ship!" ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Neville Cardus {{described}} Chapman as [...] "the schoolboy's {{dream of}} the perfect captain of an England cricket eleven. He was tall, slim, always youthful, and pink and chubby of face. His left-handed batting mingled brilliance and grace... His cricket was romantic in its vaunting energy but classic in shape." [...] While batting, Chapman always tried to attack the bowling; although this meant he made mistakes which resulted in his dismissal, it meant that he could {{change the course of}} a game in a short time. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow described him as: [...] "Tall, strong, and lithe, he was a left-handed hitter with orthodox defence, much of which was rendered unnecessary by a vast reach, and an ability to drive good-length balls over the head of mid-off, bowler, and mid-on. His cover-driving, too, was immensely strong." [...] Gibson notes that Chapman's career batting figures were good, but that critics believed that, with his talent, he should have scored more runs. Gibson writes: [...] "When Chapman was going well, he looked quite as good as Woolley [...] at the other end, and in the mid-1920s there was no other English left-hander, possibly no other England batsman at all except Hobbs, of whom that could be said." [...] His increased weight in the 1930s robbed him of confidence and slowed <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where his batting declined. When batting, Chapman usually wore the Quidnuncs cap.|$|E

500|$|Edge, who won {{a number}} one contender's match to face Van Dam for the WWE title, was unable to win their match at Vengeance. Two weeks later on Raw, Edge pinned Van Dam in a triple threat match, after blindsiding Cena with the title belt, to become WWE Champion for the second time. This angle re-ignited Edge's feud with Cena, and he lost by {{disqualification}} at Saturday Night's Main Event in order to retain the title. Subsequently, a match was made for the August event SummerSlam with the stipulation that if Edge disqualified himself, he would lose the title. [...] At the event, Edge retained the title by pinning Cena after he {{hit him in the}} back of the head with a pair of brass knuckles when the referee was not looking. The night after SummerSlam, Lita disposed of Cena's customized [...] "spinner" [...] belt into the Long Island Sound at Edge's command, who declared it the end of the [...] "Cena era" [...] in his life. Edge later unveiled the new [...] "Rated-R" [...] version of the belt. Cena, however, interfered in Edge's match with a returning Jeff Hardy later that night, chasing <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outside of the building, assaulting him, and tossing Edge into the Long Island Sound. The following week, Cena made a deal with Edge: if Edge could defeat him in a match for the WWE Championship, he would sign a contract to move to SmackDown!. Edge accepted, on the condition the match be a TLC match held at September's Unforgiven event in Edge's home town of Toronto. At the event, he lost the championship after Cena performed the FU on him, sending Edge crashing through two stacked tables from a ladder. At one point during the match, Cena locked in a modified STFU while Edge was in a ladder, who later said he was legitimately choked unconscious, the first time he had been knocked out in a match during his career.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main effect}} of Capone's {{conviction}} was that he ceased to be boss immediately on his imprisonment, but {{those involved in the}} jailing of Capone portrayed it as considerably undermining the city's organized crime syndicate. Far from being smashed, the Chicago Outfit continued without being troubled by the Chicago police, but at a lower-level and without the open violence that had marked Capone's rule. Organized crime in the city had a lower profile once Prohibition was repealed, already wary of attention after seeing Capone's notoriety bring <b>him</b> <b>down,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extent that {{there is a lack of}} consensus among writers about who was actually in control and who was a figurehead [...] "front boss".

In 34 relief appearances with Portland Martínez posted a 3-1 record with 14 saves and a 2.25 ERA. On July 22, 2003, the Red Sox traded Martínez and Brandon Lyon to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Scott Sauerbeck and Mike González. The Pirates assigned Martínez to the Double-A Altoona Curve, where he made three relief appearances before, in a strange twist, the Pirates sent him and Lyon right back to Boston on August 1, along with Jeff Suppan, while Boston returned Gonzalez while adding Freddy Sanchez. The Pirates had raised concerns over the state of Lyon's elbow (Lyon would miss the entire 2004 season); the new trade effectively canceled the old one.
