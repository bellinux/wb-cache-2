50|$|In {{common with}} the first SR DC {{electric}} locomotives (Class 70), Class 74 utilised a booster set (a motor-generator and flywheel combination) to overcome the problem of gapping. Booster set 836/2D had been designed by English Electric for use in Class 71 and this was retained in the rebuild, although weight considerations meant that the <b>flywheel</b> <b>assembly,</b> separate auxiliary generator and traction motor blowers were removed (the latter leading to the decision to downrate the traction motors). The compact size of the booster permitted a small diesel engine and generator inside the body shell (only a single booster was used in Classes 71 & 74 unlike the two of Class 70). Thus, these locomotives could operate either from a third rail supply at 650 V DC (Eastern & Central sections), 750 V DC (Western section) or from their Paxman 6YJXL 'Ventura' diesel engine, downrated to 650 hp - well within the engine's stress curve and thus greatly extending service intervals. This choice of engine (despite its problems as employed in Class 74) was a good move. 57 of these engines had been supplied for use in Class 14 and a further 20 had been supplied to Scottish workshops of BR for the re-engining program of Class 21 (such locomotives being designated Class 29). Thus a proven track record and a plentiful supply of spares was assured. The Class 71 pantograph for overhead current collection was dispensed with.|$|E
50|$|A {{twenty percent}} {{increase}} of engine capacity from 1203 cc to 1444 cc was announced on 14 August 1935. Although the engine's Tax rating was now 10.8 hp the new {{reduction in the}} rate of tax meant the annual tax charge was less. The engine fluid <b>flywheel</b> and gearbox <b>assembly</b> has a five-point bi-axial rubber mounting.|$|R
40|$|A {{structural}} assessment {{by integrating}} finite-element methods (FEM) and a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of two <b>flywheel</b> rotor <b>assemblies</b> is presented. Composite rotor A is pancake like {{with a solid}} hub design, and composite rotor B is cylindrical with a hollow hub design. Detailed analyses under combined centrifugal and interference-fit loading are performed. Two- and three-dimensional stress analyses and two-dimensional fracture mechanics analyses are conducted. A comparison of the structural analysis results obtained with those extracted via NDE findings is reported. Contact effects due to press-fit conditions are evaluated. Stress results generated from the finite-element analyses were corroborated with the analytical solution. Cracks due to rotational loading up to 49 000 rpm for rotor A and 34 000 rpm for rotor B were successfully imaged with NDE and predicted with FEM and fracture mechanics analyses. A procedure that extends current structural analysis to a life prediction tool is also defined...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{improved}} {{design of the}} manually operated pipe bending machine commonly used by local metal construction workers. The design ensures a smooth operation during the bending process during which the shape or length of the pipe is bent to a required angle. The bending force is provided {{by means of a}} gear assembly, powered by a 2 Horse Power electric motor. It is desired that the pipe material permanently yields under the applied force without breaking since upon removal of the force the material is not expected to recover its original shape (plastic deformation). Thus yield stress of the range of pipe thicknesses was duly considered in the design. The bending mechanism is achieved by use of a worm and <b>flywheel</b> gear <b>assembly,</b> a protractor scale for recording the angle of bend, a detachable handle, bend dies of different sizes (between 18 mm and 28 mm), bearings and flexible couplings. The machine can be used in rural areas where there is no power supply. In this case, the bending fork is disengaged from the flywheel and the detachable handle is connected to manually turn the fork. The test result shows a smooth pipe bending operation up to a pipe thickness of 2 mm. A square worm gave a relatively better result with the flywheel...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the design of}} a prototype flywheel energy storage assembly developed to evaluate the spacecraft Integrated Power and Attitude Control System (IPACS) concept. In the IPACS application, the <b>flywheel</b> <b>assembly</b> is used for kinetic electrical energy storage as well as conventional angular momentum control. The kinetic energy storage function dictates high rotational speeds which require new approaches to the design of the major components: rotors, motor-generators, bearing systems, and electronics. The paper includes a general description of a NASA-contracted prototype assembly, a discussion of major component design characteristics, and the presentation of preliminary test results as compared with analytical predictions. The test data were obtained from preliminary tests of the NASA prototype assembly as well as from a Rockwell prototype test unit...|$|E
40|$|Small {{satellites}} for earth observation missions {{have received}} {{attention in the}} recent years for further optimisation. A potential approach would be to optimise the existing platforms in order to cope with their increasing mission requirements (e. g. mass, volume, etc.). In this article, the idea of combining the energy storage and attitude control systems is presented based on the flywheel technology, (combined energy and attitude control system, CEACS). Such a system consists of a double counter rotating <b>flywheel</b> <b>assembly</b> serving simultaneously for the satellite energy and attitude management. First, numerical treatments are conducted for the CEACS rotor to determine a failure free operational speed corresponding to the rotor stresses and natural frequencies. Then, the mathematical model describing the energy and attitude control is established, and the CEACS onboard architecture is implemented. Further, numerical simulations for the developed architecture are performed for the ideal and non-ideal test cases. This end-to-end system demonstration indicates that the CEACS is judiciously feasible, and is a potential subsystem for the future small satellites...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental performance characterization study of a high speed, permanent magnet motor/generator (M/G) and drive applied to a flywheel module. Unlike the conventional electric machine the flywheel M/G is not a separated unit; its stator and rotor are integrated into a <b>flywheel</b> <b>assembly.</b> The M/G rotor is mounted on a flywheel rotor, which is magnetically levitated and sealed within a vacuum chamber during the operation. Thus, {{it is not possible to}} test the M/G using direct load measurements with a dynamometer and torque transducer. Accordingly, a new in-situ testing method had to be developed. The paper describes a new flywheel M/G and drive performance evaluation technique, which allows the estimation of the losses, efficiency and power quality of the flywheel high speed permanent magnet M/G, while working in vacuum, over wide frequency and torque ranges. This method does not require any hardware modification nor any special addition to the test rig. This new measurement technique is useful for high-speed applications, when applying an external load is technically difficult...|$|E
40|$|In many cases, {{an initial}} symptom of {{hardware}} malfunction is unusual or unexpected acoustic noise. Many {{industries such as}} automotive, heating and air conditioning, and petro-chemical processing use noise and vibration data along with rotating machinery analysis techniques to identify noise sources and correct hardware defects. The NASA/Johnson Space Center Acoustics Office monitors the acoustic environment of the International Space Station (ISS) through periodic sound level measurement surveys. Trending of the sound level measurement survey results can identify in-flight hardware anomalies. The crew of the ISS {{also serves as a}} "detection tool" in identifying unusual hardware noises; in these cases the spectral analysis of audio recordings made on orbit can be used to identify hardware defects that are related to rotating components such as fans, pumps, and compressors. In this paper, three examples of the use of sound level measurements and audio recordings for the diagnosis of in-flight hardware anomalies are discussed: identification of blocked inter-module ventilation (IMV) ducts, diagnosis of abnormal ISS Crew Quarters rack exhaust fan noise, and the identification and replacement of a defective <b>flywheel</b> <b>assembly</b> in the Treadmill with Vibration Isolation (TVIS) hardware. In each of these examples, crew time was saved by identifying the off nominal component or condition that existed and in directing in-flight maintenance activities to address and correct each of these problems...|$|E
