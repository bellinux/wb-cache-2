60|$|Once upon a {{time there}} was erected in Longacre Square, New York, a large white statue, {{labelled}} 'Our City', {{the figure of a}} woman in Grecian robes holding aloft a shield. Critical citizens objected to it for various reasons, but its real fault was that its symbolism was faulty. The sculptor should have represented New York as a conjuror in evening dress, smiling blandly as he changed a rabbit into a bowl of goldfish. For that, above all <b>else,</b> <b>is</b> <b>New</b> York's speciality. It changes.|$|E

5000|$|The Paramount had squarer lines {{than its}} {{predecessor}} the Supreme, with cleaner lines, a flatter roof line and square-cornered side windows including a small [...] "feature window" [...] just behind the front wheelarch. Forward of this, the window line sloped downwards to meet the deeper windscreen. The rear was similar to Supreme V and VI but all <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>new.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Over!' {{repeated}} Mr Meagles, {{who appeared}} (though without any ill-nature) {{to be in}} that peculiar state of mind in which the last word spoken by anybody <b>else</b> <b>is</b> a <b>new</b> injury. 'Over! and why should I say no more about it because it's over?' ...|$|R
5000|$|A notable {{purchase}} of a single trolley bus occurred in 1971, when the City Transit Company purchased a model E700A trolley bus from Western Flyer Coach (now known as New Flyer Industries). [...] It <b>was</b> the first <b>new</b> trolley coach purchased by any U.S. transit system since 1955. [...] Numbered 900, its electric motors and control equipment were taken from two of CT's retired Brill trolley buses, but all <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>new,</b> and the vehicle was widely considered to <b>be</b> a <b>new</b> trolley bus. The MVRTA was formed in 1971, and in late 1972 purchased the entire City Transit system, including its fleet of vehicles. In 1974, Flyer discontinued its model E700, replacing it with model E800.|$|R
50|$|Fright Nights {{will return}} in 2013. It is {{scheduled}} to run on seven nights in October. An attraction list has been announced with a new slew of mazes and shows. Returning is Club Blood but everything <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>new</b> with two new shows, Carnevil and Space Cowboy being the two shows for this year. Four mazes, Hillbilly Slasher 2, The Darkness, a completely revisioned The Walking Dead maze and Evil Dead maze. All rides were open on the night except for Justice Leagure: Alien Invasion.|$|E
50|$|The Emas {{is built}} on a heavily revised Toyota iQ {{platform}} including suspension and steering but everything <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>new.</b> Its 16.5 kW/h electric powertrain is supplemented by a range extender engine from Lotus Engineering; this is a 1.2 liter 3-cylinder single-cam 4 valves per cylinder engine that weighs only 56 kg dry and is optimized for 2 RPM points - 20 hp at 1,500rpm and 47 hp at 3,500rpm. Peak torque is 107Nm at 2,500rpm. The batteries are 100 X 31 Ahr Cells, 370 volts.|$|E
5000|$|The Bobs - In Public (cassette) - 1985. [...] "Several years ago, local {{musician}} and producer Jim Johnson had a hunch. This is the result. This eight-song tape captures the now-defunct Bobs at a 1983 concert at a now-defunct (What <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>new?)</b> club. Six {{of the cuts}} are not available on any other Bobs recordings. The band played everything from country and punk to reggae. The performance is tough and tight and the production and recording quality is very good. The Bobs should {{have been at least}} as popular as Husker Du." ...|$|E
60|$|It was two {{or three}} days before they started, for they found the next morning that they were both too {{severely}} bruised to set out at once on the journey. As Malcolm had taken care to keep the purse containing Ronald's money securely fastened to a belt under his clothes they had no lack of funds; but as time was no object they started for Paris on foot. Ronald greatly enjoyed the journey. Bright weather had set in after the storm. It was now the middle of May, all nature was bright and cheerful, the dresses of the peasantry, the style of architecture so different to that to which he was accustomed in Scotland, and everything <b>else</b> <b>were</b> <b>new</b> and strange to him. Malcolm spoke French as fluently as his own language, and they had therefore no difficulty or trouble on the way.|$|R
2500|$|In response, Plaxton {{returned}} to Ogle Design {{to create a}} new look for their coach products. The result was the Plaxton Paramount, which appeared at the 1982 British Motor Show. The Paramount was a squarer design than the Supreme, with cleaner lines, a flatter roof line and a distinctive [...] "feature window" [...] just behind the front wheelarch. The use of the [...] "feature window" [...] was a return to a trump card played by the Ogle-inspired Panorama/Panorama I first seen in 1964. From there the waistline sloped down to meet the deeper windscreen. Initially there were two versions, the Paramount 3200 (available in 8, 10, 11 and 12-metre lengths) and the high-floor Paramount 3500 (available in 11 and 12 metre lengths) to replace the successful Viewmaster. Around 30% of Mark I Paramounts were the 3500 high-floor option, a greater proportion than had been anticipated. The rear of both versions were similar to Supreme V and VI but all <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>new.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The band {{brought in}} Youth to produce, having had good {{experiences}} with his production on singles All You Good Good People and Come Back to What You Know {{from their first}} album, The Good Will Out. Most of the band were excited about the effect that bringing new leadership into the studio was having on their music, but Danny McNamara, the band's lead singer, {{had a tough time}} adjusting to Youth's production style: [...] "January, February and March this year were the hardest time of my life. I was getting four hours sleep a night. Every morning I'd get up and have to take a pill just to stay calm that day. The amount of arguments and throwing shit...It was really intense." [...] Youth changed McNamara's song structures, his lyrics, and pushed him to sing with more emotion. Said McNamara: [...] "There were times I hated him. I'd ring our manager and have meetings with the label, where I'd say, 'Look, can you tell him who's boss? 'Cause he's not listening to me.'" [...] Thankfully, the label kept its position that Youth was in charge, because gradually, things started to click between the band and its producer. McNamara eventually changed his tune, saying, [...] "I think I've grown as a person...the idea of relinquishing control and just having a bit of belief and faith in someone <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>new</b> to me in my thirty-three years. And it's paid off. I've left my ego at the door." [...] Several songs began to take shape and sound that had previously eluded the band.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that authorities in Chechnya have been arresting and torturing men suspected to be gay. Over 100 men have been arrested and tortured in secret detention facilities that some human rights groups charge to be concentration camps. Prisoners are being starved, electroshocked, beaten, and sometimes beaten to death. Detainees are being held for ransom. Prisoners are being forced to reveal who <b>else</b> <b>is</b> gay. <b>News</b> reports <b>are</b> saying that at least three men have been killed, but the number killed may be as many as twenty. The Chechen authorities are denying this and are denying that LGBT people exist, saying, [...] "You cannot arrest or repress people who just don’t exist in the republic." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Thailand {{version of}} 2012 Toyota Hilux Vigo [...] "Champ" [...] is a {{significant}} [...] "minor" [...] change with a new front look and a revamped interior to reinforce perceived luxuriousness. The front is redesigned from the A pillar forwards. With the exception of doors, roofs and tailgates, everything <b>else</b> <b>is</b> new: <b>new</b> guards, new headlights, new bumper, new bonnet, new three-bar grille, new taillights, a new rear bumper, new models badge and other. There <b>are</b> also <b>new</b> mirrors and new alloy wheel designs. The interior features a new upper dashboard design with a new horizontal centre instrument cluster. Perceived quality has been improved through the adoption of uniformly darker finishes with greater colour consistency throughout the interior. The high-end Double Cab version now comes with a DVD player, rear camera and Bluetooth functionality.|$|R
5000|$|Tucker {{writes about}} the New Age movement, [...] "The most popular and widely publicized new {{religion}} {{in recent years has}} <b>been</b> the <b>New</b> Age movement, a difficult-to-define variety of mystical, spiritualistic, and occultic groups that above all <b>else</b> <b>are</b> not <b>new.</b> From channeling crystals to harmonic convergence, celebrities and ordinary citizens have been captivated by this increasingly popular religious trend." [...] Tucker asks: [...] "Is New Age merely an age-old form of the occult that will taper off in popularity as the fad loses its luster, or is it truly a movement that has only barely begun to make its all-encompassing mark on the world?" [...] and warns that [...] "every individual concerned about maintaining traditional Christian values should be apprehensive about the potential negative effect the New Age may have on the coming generations." ...|$|R

40|$|It is the fashion, when {{discussing}} Patricia Carlon's thrillers, {{to claim that}} she has been shamefully ignored in her home country. So what? If Miss Carlon (1927 – 2002) had been a genius of the running track or swimming pool and couldn't get a gig in the Australian Olympic team, that would be a scandal. But she was a writer. She was ignored. What <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>new?</b> What we really want to know is whether her thrillers are worth all the fuss. Do they deserve to be reissued after being out of print for many years...|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, plans emerged {{for a major}} {{expansion}} of the hotel, which would include adjoining properties 9 Essex Street and 9, 10 and 11 Wellington Quay. The project architect is Norman Foster. All of the historic buildings would be gutted, leaving just the façades. Everything <b>else</b> would <b>be</b> <b>new.</b> The budget <b>is</b> projected at US$237.2 million. There has been strong opposition from historic preservation groups including An Taisce, but support from some city agencies. One critic said that [...] "The Clarence demolition is an old-fashioned money-driven, anti-environmental exploit," [...] adding that [...] "Bono is behaving like just another private-jet-addicted property speculator feeding on Ireland's greedy zeitgeist." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nothing <b>else</b> <b>was</b> said; a <b>new</b> danger <b>was</b> {{being carried}} toward {{them by the}} river. Some wooden {{machinery}} had just given way {{on one of the}} wharves, and huge fragments were being floated along. The sun was rising now, and the wide area of watery desolation was spread out in dreadful clearness around them; in dreadful clearness floated onward the hurrying, threatening masses. A large company in a boat that was working its way along under the Tofton houses observed their danger, and shouted, [...] "Get out of the current!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Group {{tensions}} within The Church proper {{were still}} simmering, however. More than anyone <b>else,</b> it <b>was</b> <b>new</b> drummer Tim Powles {{who tried to}} alleviate the outstanding disagreements. While Koppes and Willson-Piper had already had differences for some time, Kilbey and Willson-Piper's relationship was also strained by recent problems. Kilbey declared that the end was nigh: after a final, worthy swan song, with the working title Au Revoir Por Favor, the Church would be put to rest. The four agreed to play a string of farewell concerts around Australia, {{which turned out to}} be extremely successful. The roaring success of the intended [...] "final concert" [...] in Sydney put a quick end to talk of the band's demise.|$|R
5000|$|At {{first she}} thought her poems to be seriously flawed and heavy-handed but soon {{discovered}} that poems worked out for themselves out in her mind and then become something <b>else,</b> something that <b>is</b> <b>new</b> again. That <b>is</b> why she submitted her collection to the Palanca Literary Contests, her collection [...] "In Time Being and Other Poems" [...] won second prize in 1993, and [...] "Katipunera" [...] won first prize in 1995. [...] "Katipunera" [...] also won in the Free Press Poetry Contest in 1996.|$|R
50|$|Engine bore, {{stroke and}} redline {{remained}} unchanged; everything <b>else</b> <b>was</b> completely <b>new.</b> The clutch <b>was</b> changed from hydraulic to cable-operated. The generator was moved {{from behind the}} cylinder to the more conventional location at the left end of the crank. There was now no balance shaft. The valvetrain switched to direct valve actuation, and the cylinder head was plumbed for then-new plug-top ignition coils, replacing more conventional remote coils and high-tension leads. Notably, the new engine also featured a Hall-type cam position sensor on the exhaust camshaft. Cam position sensors are typically {{used in conjunction with}} electronic fuel injection. As the ZX900C featured induction by Keihin 40 mm CVKD carburettors, a cam position sensor wasn't necessary. Its inclusion could indicate that Kawasaki had designs to include fuel injection on the engine in the future. This first happened on the 2000 ZX-12R Kawasaki's first fuel-injected sport bike since the 1981-1985 GPZ1100.But this did not happen on this engine until the 2003 introduction of the Z1000, which uses a bored-out ex-ZX-9R engine.|$|R
50|$|A {{new edition}} of her book was {{published}} posthumously in Germany in 2003, again anonymously. It met wide critical acclaim {{and was on the}} bestseller list for weeks. A controversy broke out when a literary editor revealed the author as Hillers. No one <b>else</b> has <b>been</b> suggested. <b>New</b> English editions <b>were</b> published in the United Kingdom and the United States in 2005, as well as in seven other languages. The book was adapted as a film and released first in 2008 in Germany and Poland. In the United States it is known as A Woman in Berlin.|$|R
5000|$|Corfield began filming on 18 February 2011, {{alongside}} fellow new {{cast member}} Simon Rivers who plays Kevin Tyler. She {{felt that it}} was great having someone <b>else</b> who <b>was</b> <b>new</b> by her side. Corfield and Rivers began shooting during triple banking and also had a documentary crew working with them. In early May, Doctors released a video on the serial's official website. This was to introduce their audience to the new characters. Lloyd said that when the series created new characters he worried about the casting stages. This was because he believed it can ruin the work put in during the creation process. However, Lloyd praised Corfield and Rivers' casting because he believed that they were just [...] "right" [...] and a [...] "couple of corkers". Lloyd later told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that the introduction of Freya and Kevin had helped to [...] "even things out" [...] and create a [...] "good cross section". Corfield's first scenes as Freya aired during the episode broadcast on 11 May 2011.|$|R

40|$|Please imagine {{attending}} a rehearsal of a theatre production: We are sitting {{back in the}} last row, observing the preparations being made for the first run-through of a Shakespeare scene. Stage technicians assemble the scenery, actors and ac-tresses are warming up, names are being called out across the stage; someone is practicing some excerpted sentences, and someone <b>else</b> <b>is</b> testing a <b>new</b> position for a monologue. Finally, all the preparations wind down, and the piece begins with the first sentence. There is nothing exceptional about all this; nearly every initial run-through of a theater production resembles this description. But some days later, we also attend the premiere. There we experience the very same procedure: the stage technicians assembling the scenery, actors and actresses running through posi-tions, names being called out, and excerpts being practiced. The entire spectacle seems just like a rehearsal, and then the piece begins. Had we not visited the rehearsal, we would probably consider it self-evident {{that all of this}} is just acting, and we might not be capable of believing that any...|$|R
