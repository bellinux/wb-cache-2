5000|$|The UJT {{has three}} terminals: an emitter (E) and two bases (B1 and B2) {{and so is}} {{sometimes}} known a [...] "double-base diode". The base is formed by a lightly doped n-type bar of silicon. Two ohmic contacts B1 and B2 are attached at its ends. The emitter is of p-type and is heavily doped; this single PN junction gives the device its name. The resistance between B1 and B2 when the emitter is open-circuit is called <b>interbase</b> <b>resistance.</b> The emitter junction is usually located closer to base-2 (B2) than base-1 (B1) so that the device is not symmetrical, because a symmetrical unit does not provide optimum electrical characteristics {{for most of the}} applications.|$|E
