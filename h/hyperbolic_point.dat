40|$|International audienceThe {{magnetic}} {{structure of}} ultrathin films caused by dipolar interactions is studied analytically. A Taylor Maclaurin series expansion of dipolar interactions {{enables us to}} consider dipolar interactions as local interactions in function of the spin field and its space derivatives. This allows a fruitful comparison with liquid crystal phenomenological Hamiltonians. Dipolar anisotropy appears at lowest order in the expanded dipolar interaction. The next non zero term favours the appearance of vortices and <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>points</b> in finite ultrathin films while the next one, the fourth order term, controls the competition between vortices, <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>points</b> and other topological defects. The magnetic structure of an ultrathin film depends on the transversal sample size by means of higher order terms. For a very limited ultrathin dot, a structure with just one vortex is stable; for larger samples, networks of vortices, <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>points</b> and other topological defects have a lower energy than a single vortex. For larger and larger samples, more and more complex structures optimize a discrete screening of the dipolar interaction. The dynamical properties of magnetic vortices, <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>points</b> and other defects are also studied with evidence for different classes of eigen modes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a theoretical background for Lagrangian Descriptors (LDs). The goal of achieving rigourous proofs that justify {{the ability of}} LDs to detect invariant manifolds is simplified by introducing an alternative definition for LDs. The definition is stated for $n$-dimensional systems with general time dependence, however we rigorously prove that this method reveals the stable and unstable manifolds of <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>points</b> in four particular 2 D cases: a <b>hyperbolic</b> saddle <b>point</b> for linear autonomous systems, a <b>hyperbolic</b> saddle <b>point</b> for nonlinear autonomous systems, a <b>hyperbolic</b> saddle <b>point</b> for linear nonautonomous systems and a <b>hyperbolic</b> saddle <b>point</b> for nonlinear nonautonomous systems. We also discuss further rigorous results which show the ability of LDs to highlight additional invariants sets, such as $n$-tori. These results are just a simple extension of the ergodic partition theory which we illustrate by applying this methodology to well-known examples, such as the planar field of the harmonic oscillator and the 3 D ABC flow. Finally, we provide a thorough discussion on the requirement of the objectivity (frame-invariance) property for tools designed to reveal phase space structures and their implications for Lagrangian descriptors...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey were {{compared}} with the archaeological excavation outcomes of a twelfth century abbey site (Badia Pozzeveri). The goal was to associate the types of reflections recorded in GPR profiles and high-amplitude features visible in amplitude maps with unearthed archaeological features. GPR profiles crossing the walls evidenced axes of <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>point</b> source reflections and short planar reflections respectively generated by the stones forming the lateral sides/upper corners {{and the top of}} the structure. Moreover, the stones in the core of the wall caused small <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>point</b> source reflections with interfering axes, which produced a chaotic reflection profile. The resampling and gridding of these reflections collectively generated high-amplitude linear features in the amplitude maps. The presence in the graves of bones generates small <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>point</b> source reflections with interfering axes in the GPR profile, with a consequently chaotic reflection profile. Moreover, the existence of lythic slabs topping and/or siding the graves generates short planar reflections and axes of <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>point</b> source reflections. The resampling and gridding of these types of reflections generates in the amplitude map features that cannot be locally distinguished from those caused by the local aggregation of sediments with no archaeological relevance. The GPR profiles crossing trenches and pit-kiln showed dipping reflectors unconformably resting on a basal planar reflector. Disconformity marks the onset of trench and pit-kiln decommissioning with the infilling of clayey silty layers and anthropogenic remains. These features in the amplitude maps correspond to medium to high-amplitude areas. The results show that types of reflection can be associated to specific elements of archaeological structure for a detailed interpretation of a complex subsurface setting. Furthermore, it is evidenced that the interpretation of GPR profiles must be considered an indispensable pre-requisite for a full comprehension of amplitude maps...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we generalize {{the method of}} Lagrangian {{descriptors}} to two dimensional, area preserving, autonomous and nonautonomous discrete time dynamical systems.
