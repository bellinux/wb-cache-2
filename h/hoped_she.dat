5|$|In 1987, Wintour {{returned}} to New York {{to take over}} House & Garden. Its circulation had long lagged behind rival Architectural Digest, and Condé Nast <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> could improve it. Again, she made radical changes to staff and look, canceling $2million worth of photo spreads and articles in her first week. She put so much fashion in photo spreads that it became known as House & Garment, and enough celebrities that it {{was referred to as}} Vanity Chair, within the industry.|$|E
5|$|During {{her first}} {{appearances}} as {{a figment of}} Newt's imagination, Rae was depicted as a goth with an emo persona. When she was reintroduced as a real person, Rae's character was more reminiscent {{to that of a}} chav. The character later underwent a transitional period; she retained her strong personality, but displayed a weaker side resulting from the setbacks she encountered. Barlow found the role challenging, as her own personality is dissimilar from her character's. She described Rae as someone who always makes her opinion known, and <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> would be remembered for her strong-willed persona.|$|E
5|$|Amid notable controversy, Sörenstam {{was invited}} {{to play in the}} PGA Tour's Bank of America Colonial golf tournament in Fort Worth, Texas, in May 2003, making her the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event since Babe Zaharias, who {{qualified}} for the 1945 Los Angeles Open. Vijay Singh, fourth in the world rankings at the time, was particularly critical of her presence; he was quoted saying she had no business playing and he <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> missed the cut, although this statement was later proven to be misquoted and he later apologized. Cheered through each hole, she shot five over par, tying for 96th out of the 111 who finished the first two rounds, missing the cut. After shooting 1-over-par 71 in the first round, finishing in 73rd and on pace to challenge for a weekend spot, Sörenstam said she was nervous all day but pleased by her performance.|$|E

5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> would not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E
5|$|Though the Earl {{had come}} out as homosexual, on 14 September 1984 he married Francesca Fisher, then 20, the day before his 30th birthday. In sharp {{contrast}} to the Earl, Fisher was a teetotaler and a vegetarian, and he <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> would be a calming influence on his life. He also wanted to give up drug use and homosexuality and produce an heir. His father refused to attend the wedding, going as far as to place an advertisement in The Times that he had a prior engagement. The marriage lasted for three years, but quickly fell apart after he started freebasing cocaine and using rent boys. During the marriage, the Earl accidentally drove a car half way over a cliff while Francesca was a passenger. They had no children. He later formed a close friendship with James Whitby, who became a companion for most of the remainder of his life.|$|E

25|$|Jackson {{played an}} {{important}} role during the civil rights movement. In August 1956, she met Ralph Abernathy and Martin Luther King Jr. at the National Baptist Convention. A few months later, both King and Abernathy contacted her about coming to Montgomery, Alabama, to sing at a rally {{to raise money for the}} bus boycott. They also <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> would inspire the people who were getting discouraged with the boycott.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{subjects}} Coleridge discusses in the Sonnets on Eminent Characters series, only Siddons and Richard Sheridan represent the theatre. The poem discusses many of Siddons's theatrical roles, including her performances in various plays by William Shakespeare. The poem also compares Coleridge's witnessing of the performances {{to a child}} hearing stories told to him. Coleridge's feelings towards Siddons continued to be favourable and he even wrote a play that he <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> would take a part. However, that play was not produced.|$|E
25|$|Dredd sent Judge Castillo {{away from}} the main party to search for an {{abandoned}} outpost from which it was <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> could raise Mega-City One on whatever communication equipment was there, while Dredd remained in charge of survival efforts. While Castillo struggled through the hostile terrain on foot, Dredd was forced {{to deal with a}} rogue Mark 2A Mechanismo robot which had escaped the stricken spaceship and which had been responsible for causing the crash in the first place. Dredd prevented the robot from assassinating McGruder, who finally saw the error of her ways and pardoned Dredd for his crimes.|$|E

25|$|In an epilogue, an {{old woman}} sits in the Hall of Mirrors, {{apparently}} waiting for someone. She is eventually joined by an old man, who greets her and expresses his joy that she waited, just as he <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> would. In a flash of light, the old woman is revealed to be Constance {{and the old man}} Daniel. After her death, she waited in the Hall of Mirrors for Daniel, so that the two could advance to the afterlife together. With Daniel's own passing, the two were finally able to be together the way they could not be in life.|$|E
25|$|Eleanor's {{marriage}} in 1254 {{to the future}} Edward I of England {{was not the first}} marriage her family planned for her. The kings of Castile had long made a tenuous claim to be paramount lords of the Kingdom of Navarre in the Pyrenees, and from 1252 Ferdinand III's heir, Eleanor's half-brother Alfonso X of Castile, <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> would marry Theobald II of Navarre. To avoid Castilian control, Margaret of Bourbon (mother and regent to Theobald II) in August 1253 allied with James I of Aragon instead, and as part of that treaty solemnly promised that Theobald would never marry Eleanor.|$|E
25|$|Odetta {{was born}} in Birmingham, Alabama. She grew up in Los Angeles, where she {{attended}} Belmont High School. She then studied music at Los Angeles City College while employed as a domestic worker. She had operatic training {{from the age of}} 13. Her mother <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> would follow Marian Anderson, but Odetta doubted a large black girl would ever perform at the Metropolitan Opera. Her first professional experience was in musical theater in 1944, as an ensemble member for four years with the Hollywood Turnabout Puppet Theatre, working alongside Elsa Lanchester. In 1949, she joined the national touring company of the musical Finian's Rainbow.|$|E

Usher said of the song that right after he confessed with his real woman, he <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> would still give him a chance.

[...] The Mondale campaign hoped that her selection would change a campaign {{in which he was}} well behind; in addition to attracting women, they <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> could attract ethnic Democrats in the Northeast U.S. who had abandoned their party for Reagan in 1980. Her personality, variously described as blunt, feisty, spirited, and somewhat saucy, was also viewed as an asset. [...] In turn, Mondale accepted the risk that came with her inexperience.|$|E

On April 27, 2010, Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly reported that Morris would be upgraded to a series regular for season two. Speaking to E! Online, Morris commented: [...] "It's so fun.

500|$|The {{decision}} {{to name the}} scholarship after Agha-Soltan {{was that of the}} donors rather than the college: Paul Madden, the Provost of the college, said that [...] "within reason" [...] donors decided the name of a scholarship. The scholarship pays college fees of about £4,000 over a two-year period. It is open to all students at Queen's studying for post-graduate degrees in philosophy, with preference given to Iranian nationals or those with Iranian heritage. The first holder of the scholarship was Arianne Shahvisi, studying philosophy of physics, who is of Iranian descent. [...] She said that it was [...] "a great honour" [...] to be awarded the scholarship, adding that she <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> could [...] "do justice" [...] to Agha-Soltan's name. She was succeeded by an unnamed male student, studying political philosophy and the history of political thought.|$|E
