5000|$|... {{acting as}} <b>interim</b> <b>receiver</b> or {{provisional}} liquidator: At any time after a petition for an insolvency order under s122 of the Insolvency Act 1986 has been presented, the court may appoint the OR as <b>interim</b> <b>receiver</b> (for an individual) or as provisional liquidator (for a company). This {{is to protect}} a debtor's property, or take control of a company' affairs, pending {{the outcome of the}} hearing of the petition; ...|$|E

50|$|A farmer {{cannot be}} petitioned into {{bankruptcy}} or have an <b>interim</b> <b>receiver</b> appointed {{with respect to}} his assets, but may opt to make an assignment in bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|Burton Wiand’s April, 2009 <b>interim</b> <b>receiver's</b> report, {{submitted}} {{as part of}} the Securities and Exchange Commission’s {{civil suit}} against Nadel, says Nadel paid out some $53 million in “fictitious profits” as part of his Ponzi scheme.|$|R
50|$|The LIA {{appointed}} the English law firm Enyo Law to pursue litigations. Enyo law {{was forced to}} step aside in April 2015 but was re-instated in July 2015 when the English High Court approved the LIA's application to appoint BDO LLP (UK) as <b>interim</b> <b>receivers</b> and Enyo Law were reappointed as solicitors in the litigations.|$|R
5000|$|In early 2014, Breish {{initiated}} {{legal proceedings}} {{on behalf of}} the LIA against Goldman Sachs and Société Générale S.A to recover billions of dollars lost through improper transactions done in their dealings with the LIA during the Gaddafi regime. [...] The LIA appointed the English law firm Enyo Law to pursue the litigations. The Enyo Law Firm was forced to step aside in April 2015 [...] but was re-instated in July 2015 when the English High Court approved the LIA’s application to appoint BDO LLP (UK) as <b>interim</b> <b>receivers</b> and Enyo Law were reappointed as solicitors in the litigations.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} case, the {{applicant}} must give an undertaking {{with respect to}} the debtor's legal rights, and to damages in the event of the application being dismissed. The <b>interim</b> <b>receiver</b> can take conservatory measures and dispose of perishable property in order to comply with the order of the court, but the receiver cannot otherwise unduly interfere with the bankrupt in the carrying on of the debtor's business.|$|E
5000|$|Later in 2013, {{acting as}} trustee for four {{bankrupt}} companies and <b>interim</b> <b>receiver</b> of a charitable foundation, Doyle Salewski Inc. successfully negotiated {{a settlement with}} the son of renowned Ottawa developer Thomas G. Assaly [...] in the alleged misappropriation of $3.7 million. The court required Assaly [...] to turn over assets on which Doyle Salewski Inc. hoped to recover between $1.85 million and $2.8 million to be divided among investors and other creditors.

50|$|The Act's {{mandatory}} requirements {{have been}} strictly {{interpreted by the}} courts. For example, it has been held that a farmer cannot waive the secured creditor's obligation to given notice of intention to enforce security, even {{where it has been}} included in a mediation agreement. However, a stay cannot affect the appointment already in effect of an <b>interim</b> <b>receiver</b> for the purposes of preserving the estate of a bankrupt for the benefit of creditors, as it is not a proceeding for the recovery of a debt.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We present radio-interferometric {{observations}} of HCN J = 1 ! 0 line emission from the carbon star R Scl, obtained with the <b>interim</b> 3 -mm <b>receivers</b> of the Australia Telescope Compact Array. The emission is resolved into a central source with a Gaussian FWHM of 100, which we identify {{as the present}} mass loss envelope. Using a simple photodissociation model and constraints from single-dish HCN spectra, we argue that the present mass-loss rate is low, 2 10 − 7 M yr− 1, supporting the idea that R Scl had to experience a brief episode of intense mass loss {{in order to produce}} the detached CO shell at 1000 radius inferred from single-dish observations. Detailed radiative transfer modelling yields an abundance of HCN relative to H 2, fHCN, of 10 − 5 in the present-day wind. There appears to be a discrepancy between model results obtained with higher transition single-dish data included and those from the J = 1 ! 0 interferometer data alone, in that the interferometer data suggest a smaller envelope size and larger HCN abundance than the single-dish data. The lack of HCN in the detached shell, fHCN < 2 10 − 7, is consistent with the rapid photodissociation of HCN into CN as it expands away from the star...|$|R
40|$|We present radio-interferometric {{observations}} of HCN J= 1 - 0 line emission from the carbon star R Scl, obtained with the <b>interim</b> 3 -mm <b>receivers</b> of the Australia Telescope Compact Array. The emission is resolved into a central source with a Gaussian FWHM of ~ 1 arcsec, which we identify {{as the present}} mass loss envelope. Using a simple photodissociation model and constraints from single-dish HCN spectra, we argue that the present mass-loss rate is low, ~ 2 x 10 ^{- 7 } Msol/yr, supporting the idea that R Scl had to experience a brief episode of intense mass loss {{in order to produce}} the detached CO shell at ~ 10 arcsec radius inferred from single-dish observations. Detailed radiative transfer modelling yields an abundance of HCN relative to H_ 2, of ~ 10 ^{- 5 } in the present-day wind. There appears to be a discrepancy between model results obtained with higher transition single-dish data included and those from the J= 1 - 0 interferometer data alone, in that the interferometer data suggest a smaller envelope size and larger HCN abundance than the single-dish data.

40|$|As a {{corporate}} governance measure, {{the law should}} closely monitor a company 2 ̆ 7 s ability to give financial assistance to those who control it or to {{those who seek to}} acquire it. In general, such financial assistance is prohibited. Yet, because the aim of such restraint is to protect corporate assets, the usual consequence of illegality - the invalidity of the transaction and the refusal of the courts to aid enforcement or recovery - is not appropriate. For this reason, the statutory prohibition is accompanied by a saving provision allowing a company to recover payments and assets. As far as Malaysian law is concerned, a series of recent decisions by the Federal Court - Co-operative Central Bank (in receivership) v Feyen Development [1995] 3 MLJ 313, Lori (M) (<b>interim</b> <b>receiver)</b> v Arab-Malaysian Finance [1999] 3 MLJ 81, and Koperasi Rakyat v Harta Empat [2000] 3 MLJ 81 - has thrown the law into disarray. This article critically examines these cases and the approach of the court in the light of amendments to the Companies Act 1965. It concludes that legislative intervention is necessary to force a return to the pre-Feyen position...|$|E
