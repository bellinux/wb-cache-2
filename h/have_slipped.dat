5|$|The {{story is}} written to follow {{principal}} landmarks with an ultimate destination, but leaves Martin room for improvisation. On occasion, improvised details significantly affected the planned story. By the fourth book, Martin kept more private notes {{than ever before}} {{to keep track of}} the many subplots, which became so detailed and sprawling by the fifth book as to be unwieldy. Martin's editors, copy editors, and readers monitor for accidental mistakes, although some errors <b>have</b> <b>slipped</b> into publication. For instance, Martin has inconsistently referred to certain characters' eye colors, and has described a horse as being of one sex and then another.|$|E
5|$|At the party, the {{employees}} vent their hatred of Nellie onto Pam to avoid admitting the truth, making Pam uncomfortable. The magician that was hired (Brett Gelman) arrives, much to Nellie's dismay. Jim, Dwight, and Pam, out of solidarity to Nellie, sabotage the magician's tricks until he reaches breaking point and Dwight kicks him out. Nellie and Robert commend {{the employees}} for throwing a good party, but Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) complains that the carrot cake has actual vegetables in it, which Pam {{made as a}} prank. When Jim and Pam leave for the day, Pam asks Hank Tate (Hugh Dane) why he let the magician into the elevator {{when he was asked}} not to. Hank, busy reading a magazine, claims not to have noticed him, stating that as a magician he could <b>have</b> <b>slipped</b> by.|$|E

5|$|Influenced by Keynes, {{economics}} {{texts in}} the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, An Outline of Money, devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management {{and in particular the}} 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, {{since the end of the}} Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes' insights <b>have</b> <b>slipped</b> from view. They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–08.|$|E

25|$|Kulottunga {{also lost}} much of his territories in Vengi. The {{northern}} half of the Vengi kingdom if not the whole of it seems to <b>have</b> <b>slipped</b> from his hands and gone to the Western Chalukyan empire under Vikramaditya VI. Encouraged by the successes of Hoysala, Vikaramaditya invaded Vengi in 1118 CE. The aging Kulotunga summoned the Viceroy of Vengi Vikrama Chola and installed him as heir apparent to the Chola throne. Lacking any meaningful leadership in Vengi, it soon fell to Vikramaditya and remained in his hands {{until his death in}} 1126 CE. However, overall for the Cholas the loss of Vengi was a purely temporary one for they would regain Vengi under Vikrama Chola with him routing the Chalukyas in 1124–25 and Vengi would remain in the Chola-fold till rule of Kulottunga-III (1176–1218).|$|E

500|$|In a brief review, Vincent Canby {{wrote that}} it was [...] "not exactly incoherent, but {{whatever}} it originally had on its mind seems to <b>have</b> <b>slipped</b> away".

500|$|Various legends {{account for}} {{the origin of the}} Order.

When the surrounding courtiers sniggered, the king picked it up and returned it to her, exclaiming, [...] "Honi soit qui mal y pense!"

500|$|According {{to music}} {{reviewer}} Fraser McAlpine of the BBC, the song's lyrics assert that {{life should be}} viewed as [...] "a journey which is difficult but rewarding". Both Martens and McAlpine took special interest in the line [...] "It's always gonna be an uphill battle/Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose". Martens interpreted the line as an acknowledgment by the singer of her own mistakes in life, while McAlpine wrote, [...] "In this song which is about plugging away at things, the writers <b>have</b> <b>slipped</b> in [...] that the occasional setback isn't the end of the world." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{negative}} review {{came from}} Lacey of The Globe and Mail, {{who felt that}} at [...] " [...] core, it seems intended as a sympathetic drama of a bereaved mother, who may <b>have</b> <b>slipped</b> into madness. What's even more disquieting is the persistent undercurrent of exploitation – the mixture of grief and jarring shock effects and the pitiless use of a disfigured child {{as a source of}} horror." [...] A.O. Scott of The New York Times claimed the film to be a [...] "diverting, overwrought ghost story" [...] and that it [...] "relies on basic and durable horror movie techniques". Jack Matthews of New York Daily News found the ending of the film {{to be one of the}} worst of the season, but praised the acting of Belén Rueda.|$|E
500|$|After {{talking to}} Quark (Armin Shimerman) in his bar, O'Brien realises {{that he can}} change {{the rules of the}} hunt before Tosk is taken away by the Hunters. He lies to Odo and convinces him to release Tosk into his care, {{claiming}} it is a Starfleet, [...] not a Bajoran matter. O'Brien escorts the Hunter and Tosk to an airlock, but the Chief has it rigged to overload, knocking out the Hunter, allowing O'Brien to help Tosk escape. In Ops, Sisko is informed about the situation and tells Odo to pursue the duo at a leisurely pace, giving O'Brien time to help Tosk escape the station with the Hunters in pursuit. [...] Later, an angry Sisko reprimands O'Brien for his actions; the Chief expresses his surprise at not being apprehended immediately by Odo. Sisko claims that he must <b>have</b> <b>slipped</b> up and gives O'Brien a wry smile.|$|E
500|$|In January 1856, Stone {{was accused}} in court, {{and spoke in}} defense of a rumor put forward by the {{prosecution}} that Stone gave a knife to former slave Margaret Garner, on trial for the killing of her own child {{to prevent it from}} being enslaved. Stone was said to <b>have</b> <b>slipped</b> the prisoner the knife so that Garner could kill herself if she was forced to return to slavery. Stone was referred to by the court as [...] "Mrs. Lucy Stone Blackwell" [...] and was asked if she wanted to defend herself; she preferred to address the assembly off the record after adjournment, saying [...] "...With my own teeth I would tear open my veins and let the earth drink my blood, rather than wear the chains of slavery. How then could I blame her for wishing her child to find freedom with God and the angels, where no chains are?" ...|$|E

500|$|Gray {{observes that}} [...] "Jacques is enduringly {{associated}} {{with the role of}} hospital matron" [...] and her portrayal of the character in five films had a lasting impact on both her legacy and on the role and view of Matrons in the National Health Service. An article in The Guardian by Mark Lawson mixed fiction with reality when he wrote that [...] "standards of hygiene <b>have</b> <b>slipped</b> since Hattie Jacques ran NHS wards". According to The Scotsman, the 2003 Labour Party Conference [...] "applauded deliriously because the government has revived Hattie Jacques", in relation to a change in government policy. After complaints about the NHS in 2008, the Western Morning News suggested the government should [...] "clone a Hattie Jacques-type matron to run a tight ship everywhere". NHS nurses have complained about the stereotype: in August 2013 the Nursing Times quoted one matron, who protested that they were [...] "not like Hattie Jacques anymore".|$|E
500|$|Hey Good Lookin {{opened in}} New York City on October 1, 1982, and was {{released}} in Los Angeles in January 1983. The film's release was limited, and went largely unnoticed in the United States, although it garnered respectable business in foreign markets. In a brief review, Vincent Canby wrote that it was [...] "not exactly incoherent, but whatever it originally had on its mind seems to <b>have</b> <b>slipped</b> away". Animation historian Jerry Beck wrote, [...] "the beginning {{of the film is}} quite promising, with a garbage can discussing life on the streets with some garbage. This is an example of what Bakshi did best—using the medium of animation to comment on society. Unfortunately, he doesn't do it enough in this film. There is a wildly imaginative fantasy sequence during the climax, when the character named Crazy starts hallucinating during a rooftop shooting spree. This scene almost justifies the whole film. But otherwise, this is a rehash of ideas better explored in Coonskin, Heavy Traffic, and Fritz the Cat." [...] The film has since gained a cult following through cable television and home video. Quentin Tarantino stated that he preferred Hey Good Lookin to Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets.|$|E
