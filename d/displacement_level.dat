Recent developments in piezoceramic actuator technology provide a means for achieving these force and <b>displacement</b> <b>levels</b> in a compact device. This work demonstrates that prestressed, curved piezoceramic actuators achieve the force and <b>displacement</b> <b>levels</b> required for active isolation of automotive seats. An estimate of the force and displacement requirements are obtained from numerical simulations on a four-degree-of-freedom car and seat model that utilize representive road accelerations as inputs. An actuator that meets these specifications is designed using piezoceramic materials. Free displacement of 4. 4 mm and blocked force greater than 300 N are measured. The actuator is integrated within a dead mass setup that simulates the isolation characteristics of an automotive seat.

The parameters included configurations of the trench, train speed, {{the distance between the}} source and the trench, and the Poisson’s ratio of the soil. A reducing <b>displacement</b> <b>level</b> (in dB scale) was defined and used to evaluate the screening effectiveness of a wave barrier. The maximal reducing <b>displacement</b> <b>level</b> reached 25 [*]dB when an open trench was used as a wave barrier. The depth of an open trench is a main influential parameter of screening effectiveness. The cutoff frequency of the displacement spectrum increases with decreasing trench depth. The maximal screening effectiveness occurs when the depth is 0. 3 - 0. 4 Rayleigh wavelength. Using an open trench as a wave barrier can reduce 10 – 25 [*]dB of vibration amplitude at frequencies between 30 and 70 [*]Hz. A considerable increase in screening effectiveness of the open trench was observed from 30 to 70 [*]Hz, which matches the main frequencies of vibration induced by Taiwan High Speed Rail. The influence of trench width on screening effectiveness is nonsignificant except for frequencies from 30 to 40 [*]Hz.

It has been confirmed that the lateral vibration {{as well as the}} aerodynamic drag of the trains is increased and the micropressure wave is produced at the tunnel exit when the trains are passing through tunnels. The aim {{of this article is to}} explore the impact of a high-speed train passing through a tunnel on the pantograph aerodynamics and the dynamic behavior of the pantograph–catenary interaction. The aerodynamic forces acting on the pantograph are investigated thoroughly by extensive numerical simulations as well as systematic field tests. To investigate the effects of the aerodynamic forces of pantograph on the quality of current collection, the numerical simulations of the pantograph–catenary dynamic interaction are conducted with our proposed model, taking into consideration the action of the aerodynamic uplift forces obtained by the numerical simulations on the pantograph. Then, a series of numerical simulations are also carried out to analyze the effects of the train speed and the blockage ratio on the aerodynamic uplift forces of the pantograph, on the contact forces, as well as on the displacement of the contact wire, while the train is passing through a tunnel. The results reveal that compared with the open air scenarios, the aerodynamic drag and uplift forces of the pantograph, the mean value of the contact force and the <b>displacement</b> <b>level</b> of the registration arm can considerably increase as the train runs inside a tunnel. Moreover, the statistical values of the contact forces and the <b>displacement</b> <b>level</b> of the contact wire become larger while the train is passing through the tunnel at different speeds.

40|$|Synopsis: Six {{nominally}} identical {{reinforced concrete}} columns {{were subjected to}} a variety of lateral displacement histories to evaluate the effects of cycling on their failure displacement and failure mechanism. The columns, typical of bridges constructed before the mid- 1970 s, had circular cross-sections, low axial loads, and little transverse reinforcement. Shear failure caused five of the six columns to lose their axial load carrying ability at drift ratios between 3 % and 5 %. The sixth column failed in an axial-flexure mode at a drift ratio of 6 %. Increasing the number of cycles at each <b>displacement</b> <b>level</b> from one to fifteen decreased the maximum displacement preceding flexure-shear failure by approximately 35 %. The effect of cycling on damage accumulation was modeled with the Park-Ang damage model, a Modified Park-Ang damage model, and a Cumulative Plastic Deformation damage model.

From the observation of the results, it is clear that the column behaviour is path-dependent and particularly the failure mode Taylor et al. (1996). This fact is even more relevant in the case of the biaxial loading, where the coupling effect between the axial and the two transversal directions is important. Similar tests tested with different loading paths present a very distinct damage evolution Rodrigues et al. (2013). Additional research on this topic should be conducted in order to correlate the load path with the failure mode. The presented displacement paths cannot be considered as representative of an earthquake displacement path; however, the intention of calibrating numerical models imposes the definition of simplified displacement paths with smooth increase of the peak displacements and with the repetition of each <b>displacement</b> <b>level</b> in order to capture the strength and stiffness degradation along the tests.|$|E
40|$|These lectures {{treat the}} motion of finite-dimensional {{mechanical}} systems {{under the influence of}} set-valued force laws that are derived from scalar potential functions by generalized differentiation. Directional Newton-Euler equations in the configuration space are used to describe the impact-free non-smooth motion of the system. All forces are assumed to emanate from scalar force potentials on the <b>displacement</b> <b>level</b> and on the velocity level. No difference is made between constraint forces, impressed forces, and forces of intermediate type, as far as their representation via generalized gradients is concerned. This yields a clear mechanical interpretation of Lagrange multipliers as the scalar values of interaction forces acting in certain generalized directions and bridges the gap between the mathematical formulation of constraint forces and impressed forces. Some useful representations of the force laws are gathered by applying notation from convex analysis that provides a convenient handling of the decomposition of force laws on the one side and the introduction of variational calculus on the other side. Extensions of the classical variational principles in mechanics are discussed in this context. 70 Ch. Glocker 1...|$|E

For joints affected by the brown rot fungus, initial stiffness, yield load and maximum load of dowel-type joints were significantly decreased, even with a small mass loss of wood and reductions in shear performance were the largest for initial stiffness, followed by yield load and maximum load, in that order. For a 1 % reduction of the yield load, initial stiffness and maximum load showed reductions of 1. 15 % and 0. 77 %, respectively. When dowel-type joints that had been exposed to the brown rot fungus were subjected to reversed cyclic loading, the gap between the dowel and the lead hole of the wood was increased and equivalent viscous damping was decreased.

40|$|A MLS-based lattice spring {{model is}} {{presented}} for numerical modeling of elasticity of materials. In the model, shear springs between particles are introduced {{in addition to}} normal springs. However, the unknowns contain only particle displacements but no particle rotations. The novelty of the model lies in that the deformations of shear springs are computed by using the local strain obtained by the moving least squares (MLS) approximation rather than using the particle displacements directly. By doing so, the proposed lattice spring model can represent the diversity of Poisson’s ratio without violating the requirement of rotational invariance. Relationships between micro spring parameters and macro material constants are derived from the Cauchy-born rules and the hyperelastic theory. Numerical examples show that the proposed model is able to reproduce elastic solutions obtained by finite element methods for problems without fractures.
