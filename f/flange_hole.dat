5000|$|... a is {{the angle}} between (1) the radius to a nipple {{hole in the}} rim to which a spoke is attached, and, (2) the radius to the <b>flange</b> <b>hole</b> holding the spoke. The spoke crosses either 1, 2, or 3 oppositely {{pointing}} spokes depending on the lacing design. On the flange, the angle between the radii of adjacent holes is 360°/m (for equally spaced holes). For each spoke crossed, the hub is rotated {{with reference to the}} rim one [...] "angle between adjacent flange holes". Thus, multiplying the [...] "angle between adjacent flange holes" [...] by k gives the angle a. For example, a 32 spoke wheel has 16 spokes per side, 360° divided by 16 equals 22.5°. Multiply 22.5° ("angle between adjacent flange holes") by the number of crossings to get the angle a—if 3-crosses, the 32 spoke wheel has an angle a of 67.5°. Regarding r3: The size of the spoke holes in the flange does not matter for the needed spoke length. This term removes the effect of the hole size. Since the holes are usually small (just over 2 mm in diameter), the effect is small and in practice matters little.|$|E

A spiral-threaded main pin is seated in a mating bore in a housing, which main pin has a flange fastened thereon at {{the part of the}} main pin which is exterior to the housing. Accidental release tends to rotate the main pin. A secondary pin passes through a slightly oversized opening in the flange and is seated in a second bore in the housing.

In certain conditions the flange coupling design allows the same torque to be transmitted by six, but also by only five bolts.

40|$|For {{the next}} {{generation}} Single-Stage-To-Orbit (SSTO) Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV), the use of advanced composite materials is highly desirable and {{critical to the success}} of the mission. NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has been working with the aerospace industry for many years to develop and demonstrate the cryogenic composite propellant tanks and feed lines technologies. A 50. 8 -mm diameter composite feed line for the Clipper Graham (DCY. A) was developed and tested. The purpose of the program is to demonstrate the LH 2 permeability, composite to composite and metal joints, as well as composite flange interface of the composite feed line. Stress analysis and permeability testing have been performed on this article. Recently, a larger composite feed line design is being investigated and developed at MSFC for potential use in future RLV. The diameter of the feed line is 203 mm and the overall length is approximately 2. 2 meters. This one piece unlined feed line consists of three straight tubular sections joined by two 90 degree elbows. The material chosen is IM 7 / 977 - 3 prepreg fabric. The lay-up pattern is [0 / 90, plus or minus 45]s and is built up to 18 plies to the flanges at both ends. A preliminary stress analysis has been conducted to identify potential critical stresses and to develop the finite element analysis (FEA) capability of composite feed lines. As expected, the critical stresses occurred at the rims of some <b>flange</b> <b>holes</b> and the onset of the tapered tubular sections. Further analysis is required to determine the loads, flange deflection, vibration, and combined maximum loads. Two permeability-testing apparatuses were also designed for both flat panel specimens and curved feed line sections after impact damage. A larger permeant gas exposed area is required to accurately determine the effect of impact damage on the permeability of the feed line materials. The flat panel tester was fabricated and assembled. Three test coupons were made of graphite/epoxy plain weave prepreg and unidirectional prepreg. The flow rate was calculated by measuring the change of manometer fluid height per unit time. The permeability of the coupons is then calculated according to Darcy's Law. The pressure increase due to the head rise in the manometer was not considered for the initial estimation. The result of the unidirectional composite coupon agreed with that obtained from the DC-XA feed line testing of a similar material. Further improvement on the design may be required to improve the accuracy and efficiency of permeability testing...|$|R
50|$|Finger spools are a simple, compact {{low tech}} {{alternative}} to reels {{best suited to}} relatively short lengths of line. They are simply a pair of circular <b>flanges</b> with a <b>hole</b> in the middle, connected by a tubular hub, which is suitably sized to use a finger as an axle when unrolling the line. Line is secured by clipping a bolt snap through a hole {{on one of the}} flanges and over the line as it leaves the reel. Line is reeled in by holding the spool with one hand and simply winding the line onto the spool by hand. Spools are most suitable for reasonably short lines, up to about 50m, as it becomes tedious to roll up longer lengths. The small, compact size, and low cost make them useful for various purposes where long line is not required.Spools may be made from any material that is strong enough and suitable for underwater service, but engineering thermoplastics are most common.|$|R
40|$|The B-HEX® Pupil Expander (Med Invent Devices) is a {{disposable}} 6. 5 mm flexible hexagonal device with notches at corners and flanges at sides. Alternate <b>flanges</b> with positioning <b>holes</b> are tucked under the iris {{to engage the}} notches to {{the margin of the}} pupil to provide a 5. 5 mm expanded pupil.

The thin profile and uniplanar design allow unhindered instrument movement during phacoemulsification, cortical cleaning, and intraocular lens implantation. The B-HEX is safely used even after capsulorhexis since the thin uniplanar notches are directly visualized to avoid the capsule margin.

40|$|The Consolidated Incineration Facility, at the Department of Energy`s Savannah River Site, is {{designed}} to treat solid and liquid RCRA hazardous and mixed wastes generated by site operations and clean-up activities. During CIF`s pretrial burn campaigns in 1995, an appreciable amount of water was recovered from the HEPA housings. Questions were immediately raised as {{to the source of}} the water, and the degree of wetness of the filters during operation. There are two primary issues involved: Water could reduce the life expectancy and performance of the HEPA filters, housing, and associated ducting, and wet HEPAs also present radiological concerns for personnel during filter change-out. A similar phenomenon was noted at the Offgas Components Test Facility (OCTF), a 1 / 10 scale pilot of CIF`s air pollution control system. Tests at OCTF indicated the water`s most likely origin to be vapor condensing out from the flue gas stream due to excessive air in-leakage at housing door seals, ducting <b>flanges,</b> and actual <b>holes</b> in the ducting. The rate of accumulation bears no statistical correlation to such process parameters as steam flow, reheater outlet temperature and offgas velocity in the duct. Test results also indicated that the HEPA filter media is moistened by the initial process flow while the facility is being brought on line. However, even when the HEPA filters were manually drenched prior to startup, they became completely dry within four hours of the time steam was introduced to the reheater. Finally, no demonstrable relationship was found between the degree of filter media wetness and filter dP...|$|R
