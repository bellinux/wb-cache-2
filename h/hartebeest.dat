5|$|The Jackson's <b>hartebeest</b> {{does not}} have a clear taxonomic status. It is {{regarded}} as a hybrid between the Lelwel and Coke's <b>hartebeest.</b> The African Antelope Database (1998) treats it as synonymous to the Lelwel <b>hartebeest.</b> From Lake Baringo to Mount Kenya, the Jackson's <b>hartebeest</b> significantly resembles the Lelwel <b>hartebeest,</b> whereas from Lake Victoria to {{the southern part of the}} Rift Valley it tends to be more like the Coke's <b>hartebeest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alcelaphus lelwel x cokii: Known as the Kenya Highland <b>hartebeest</b> or the Laikipia <b>hartebeest.</b> It is a {{cross between}} the Lelwel and Coke's <b>hartebeest.</b> This hybrid is lighter in colour and larger than Coke's <b>hartebeest.</b> It is a light buff with reddish-tawny upper parts, and the head is longer than in Coke's <b>hartebeest.</b> Both sexes have horns, which are heavier as well as longer {{than those of the}} parents. It was {{formerly}} distributed throughout the western Kenyan highlands, between Lake Victoria and Mount Kenya, but is now believed to be restricted to the Lambwe Valley (south-west Kenya) and Laikipia and nearby regions of west-central Kenya.|$|E
5|$|A. b. caama (Saint-Hilaire, 1803) : Known {{as the red}} <b>hartebeest</b> or Cape <b>hartebeest.</b> Formerly {{occurred}} in southern Angola; northern and eastern savannahs of Namibia; central, southern and southwestern Botswana; Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Free State, Northwest and Gauteng provinces and western KwaZulu-Natal of South Africa. Presently has been eliminated from all these areas except Northern Cape, central and southwestern Botswana and Namibia. Major re-introductions {{have taken place in}} these countries. The population of this <b>hartebeest</b> is on the rise.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back {{differentiate}} the <b>hartebeest</b> from other antelopes. The <b>hartebeest</b> shares several physical traits with the sassabies (genus Damaliscus), {{such as an}} elongated and narrow face, {{the shape of the}} horns, the pelage texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail. The wildebeest have more specialised skull and horn features than the <b>hartebeest.</b> The <b>hartebeest</b> exhibits sexual dimorphism, but only slightly, as both sexes bear horns and have similar body masses. The degree of sexual dimorphism varies by subspecies. Males are 8% heavier than females in Swayne's and Lichtenstein's <b>hartebeest,</b> and 23% heavier in the red <b>hartebeest.</b> In one study, the highest dimorphism was found in skull weight. Another study concluded that the length of the breeding season is a good predictor of dimorphism in pedicle (the bony structures from which the horns grow) height and skull weight, and the best predictor of the horn circumference.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>hartebeest</b> {{subspecies}} {{is listed}} {{under a different}} conservation status by the IUCN. The species {{as a whole is}} classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. The <b>hartebeest</b> is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Lesotho, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, and Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hartebeest</b> {{are popular}} game and trophy animals {{as they are}} {{prominently}} visible and hence easy to hunt. Pictorial as well as epigraphic evidence from Egypt suggests that in the Upper Palaeolithic age, Egyptians hunted <b>hartebeest</b> and domesticated them. The <b>hartebeest</b> was a prominent source of meat, but its economic significance was {{lower than that of}} gazelles and other desert species. However, {{from the beginning of the}} Neolithic age, hunting became less common and consequently the remains of the <b>hartebeest</b> from this period in Egypt, where it is now extinct, are rare.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hartebeest</b> are {{primarily}} grazers, and their diets consist mostly of grasses. A {{study in the}} Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso found that the hartebeest's skull structure eased the acquisition and chewing of highly fibrous foods. The <b>hartebeest</b> has much lower food intake than {{the other members of}} Alcelaphini. The long thin muzzle of the <b>hartebeest</b> assists in feeding on leaf blades of short grasses and nibbling off leaf sheaths from grass stems. In addition to this, it can derive nutritious food even from tall senile grasses. These adaptations of the <b>hartebeest</b> enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season, which is usually a difficult period for grazers. For instance, in comparison with the roan antelope, the <b>hartebeest</b> is better at procuring and chewing the scarce regrowth of perennial grasses at times when forage is least available. These unique abilities could have allowed the <b>hartebeest</b> to prevail over other animals millions of years ago, leading to its successful radiation in Africa.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hartebeest</b> {{are remarkably}} alert and {{cautious}} animals with highly developed brains. Generally calm in nature, <b>hartebeest</b> can be ferocious when provoked. While feeding, one individual {{stays on the}} lookout for danger, often standing on a termite mound to see farther. At times of danger, the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off. Adult <b>hartebeest</b> are preyed upon by lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs; cheetahs and jackals target juveniles. Crocodiles may also prey on <b>hartebeest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several parasites {{have been}} {{isolated}} from the <b>hartebeest.</b> These parasites regularly alternate between <b>hartebeest</b> and gazelles or wildebeest. <b>Hartebeest</b> can be infected with theileriosis due to Rhipicephalus evertsi and Theileria species. South of the Sahara, common parasites include Loewioestrus variolosus, Gedoelstia cristata and G. hassleri. The latter two species can cause serious diseases such as encephalitis. However, parasites are not always harmful – 252 larvae {{were found in the}} head of one Zambian individual without any pathogenicity. Nematodes, cestodes, paramphistomes; and the roundworm Setaria labiatopapillosa have also been {{isolated from the}} <b>hartebeest.</b> In 1931, a red <b>hartebeest</b> in Gobabis (southwestern Africa) was infected with long, thin worms. These were named Longistrongylus meyeri after their collector, T. Meyer.|$|E
5|$|Coke's <b>hartebeest</b> {{is listed}} as Least Concern. This species has been greatly {{affected}} by habitat destruction, and about 42,000 Coke's <b>hartebeest</b> occur today in Mara, Serengeti National Park, and Tarangire National Park in Tanzania and Tsavo East National Park in Kenya. The population is decreasing, and 70% of the population lives in protected areas.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a study scrutinised {{two major}} {{populations of the}} Swayne's <b>hartebeest,</b> from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary and the Nechisar National Park, for {{mitochondrial}} (D-loop) and nuclear (microsatellite) variability {{in an attempt to}} estimate the levels of genetic variation between the populations and within the subspecies. The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; that from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more genetic diversity than the one from the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the translocation of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 had not made a significant contribution to the gene pool of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne <b>hartebeest</b> populations were compared with a large red <b>hartebeest</b> population, and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of genetic variation. The study advocated in situ conservation of the Swayne's <b>hartebeest</b> and a renewed attempt at its translocation in order to conserve genetic diversity and increase its population size in both the protected areas.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} grass {{selectivity}} among the wildebeest, zebra, and the Coke's <b>hartebeest,</b> the <b>hartebeest</b> showed the highest selectivity. All animals preferred Themeda triandra over Pennisetum mezianum and Digitaria macroblephara. More grass species were eaten in the dry season than in the wet season.|$|E
5|$|Like the sassabies, <b>hartebeest</b> produce quiet quacking and {{grunting}} sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} than adults, and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The <b>hartebeest</b> uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The <b>hartebeest</b> is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|E
5|$|Swayne's <b>hartebeest</b> {{is listed}} as Endangered, and is close to being Critically Endangered. The total {{population}} in 2008 was less than 600, of which the mature specimens numbered within 250. It is confined to four major protected areas: the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary, Nechisar National Park, Awash National Park and Mazie National Park. The <b>hartebeest</b> in Senkele {{have to compete with}} the livestock of the Oromo people. A study in the Nechisar National Park during 2009 and 2010 found a considerable increase in the livestock of the Oromos (49.9% and 56.5% increase during 2006 and 2010, respectively), illegal resource exploitation, and habitat loss as major threats to the Swayne's <b>hartebeest</b> populations there.|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the <b>hartebeest</b> is 40. Hybrids are usually reported from areas where ranges of two subspecies overlap. Hybrids between the Lelwel and Tora <b>hartebeest</b> {{have been reported}} in eastern Sudan and western Ethiopia, in a stretch southward from the Blue Nile to about 9° N latitude. A study proved a male hybrid of the red <b>hartebeest</b> and the blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus) to be sterile. Sterility of the hybrid was attributed to difficulties in segregation during meiosis, indicated by azoospermia and a low number of germ cells in its seminiferous tubules.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{fossil record}} {{dates back to}} nearly 0.7 million years ago. Fossils of the red <b>hartebeest</b> {{have been found in}} Elandsfontein, Cornelia (Free State) and Florisbad in South Africa, as well as in Kabwe in Zambia. In Israel, <b>hartebeest</b> remains have been found in northern Negev, Shephelah, Sharon Plain and Tel Lachish. This population of the <b>hartebeest</b> was originally limited to the open country of the southernmost regions of the southern Levant. It was probably hunted in Egypt, which affected the numbers in the Levant, and disconnected it from its main population in Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>hartebeest</b> is Alcelaphus buselaphus. First described by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766, it is classified in the genus Alcelaphus {{and placed in the}} family Bovidae. In 1979, palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba supported Sigmoceros as a separate genus for Lichtenstein's <b>hartebeest,</b> a kind of <b>hartebeest,</b> as she assumed it was related to Connochaetes (wildebeest). She had analysed the skull characters of living and extinct species of antelope to make a cladogram, and argued that a wide skull linked Lichtenstein's <b>hartebeest</b> with Connochaetes. However, this finding was not replicated by Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum, who classified it as an independent species of Alcelaphus. Zoologists such as Jonathan Kingdon and Theodor Haltenorth considered it to be a subspecies of A. buselaphus. Vrba dissolved the new genus in 1997 after reconsideration. An MtDNA analysis could find no evidence to support a separate genus for Lichtenstein's <b>hartebeest.</b> It also showed the tribe Alcelaphini to be monophyletic, and discovered close affinity between the Alcelaphus and the sassabies (genus Damaliscus)—both genetically and morphologically.|$|E
5|$|A. b. cokii (Günther, 1884): Known as Coke's <b>hartebeest</b> or kongoni. Native to and {{confined}} within Kenya {{and northern}} Tanzania.|$|E
5|$|Gregarious animals, <b>hartebeest</b> form {{herds of}} 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are {{primarily}} grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in <b>hartebeest</b> takes place {{throughout the year}} {{with one or two}} peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein's <b>hartebeest</b> {{is listed}} as Least Concern, and occurs in {{protected}} {{areas such as the}} Selous Game Reserve and in the wild in southern and western Tanzania and Zambia.|$|E
5|$|Some antelopes {{have been}} domesticated {{including}} the scimitar oryx, addax, elands and the extinct bubal <b>hartebeest.</b> In Ancient Egypt oryxes, addaxes and bubal hartebeests are depicted in carved walls.|$|E
5|$|The Tora <b>hartebeest</b> {{is listed}} as Critically Endangered; the IUCN has ascertained that fewer than 250 mature {{individuals}} survive as of 2008. They are possibly extinct in Sudan due to excessive hunting and agricultural expansion, but may still exist in smaller numbers in Eritrea and Ethiopia. There have been unconfirmed reports of sightings by locals of the Tora <b>hartebeest</b> southeast of the Dinder National Park, from where it had disappeared before 1960.|$|E
5|$|The genus Alcelaphus emerged about 4.4 {{million years}} ago in a clade whose other members were Damalops, Numidocapra, Rabaticeras, Megalotragus, Oreonagor, and Connochaetes. An {{analysis}} using phylogeographic patterns within <b>hartebeest</b> populations suggested a possible origin of Alcelaphus in eastern Africa. Alcelaphus quickly radiated across the African savannas, replacing several previous forms (such as a relative of the hirola). Flagstad and colleagues showed an early split in the <b>hartebeest</b> populations into two distinct lineages around 0.5 {{million years ago}} – one to the north and the other to the south of the equator. The northern lineage further diverged into eastern and western lineages, nearly 0.4 million years ago, most probably {{as a result of the}} expanding central African rainforest belt and subsequent contraction of savannah habitats during a period of global warming. The eastern lineage gave rise to the Coke's, Swayne's, Tora and Lelwel hartebeest; and from the western lineage evolved the Bubal and western <b>hartebeest.</b> The southern lineage gave rise to Lichtenstein's and red <b>hartebeest.</b> These two taxa are phylogenetically close, having diverged only 0.2 million years ago. The study concluded that these major events throughout the hartebeest's evolution are strongly related to climatic factors, and that there had been successive bursts of radiation from a more permanent population—a refugium—in eastern Africa; this could be vital to understanding the evolutionary history of not only the <b>hartebeest</b> but also other mammals of the African savanna.|$|E
5|$|A. b. lichtensteinii (Peters, 1849) : Known as Lichtenstein's <b>hartebeest.</b> Inhabits the miombo {{woodlands}} {{of eastern}} and southern Africa. It is native to Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|A. b. tora (Gray, 1873) : Known as the Tora <b>hartebeest.</b> Formerly {{occurred}} in northwestern Ethiopia and western and southwestern Eritrea. Its present status is unclear, though locals have reported small numbers from these areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} a large and diverse {{wildlife}} population. Species found in the park include Cape buffaloes, baboons, eastern black rhinos, gazelles, zebras, Tanzanian cheetahs, Coke's <b>hartebeest,</b> hippopotami, leopards, East African lions, elands, impala, Masai giraffes, ostriches, vultures and waterbucks.|$|E
5|$|A. b. lelwel (Heuglin, 1877) : Known as the Lelwel <b>hartebeest.</b> Formerly {{found in}} {{northern}} and northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo; southeastern and southwestern Sudan; and the northwestern extreme of Tanzania. Drastic population decrease since the 1980s has confined most individuals to protected areas {{inside and outside}} its range.|$|E
5|$|A. b. major (Blyth, 1869) : Known as {{the western}} <b>hartebeest.</b> Formerly {{occurred}} widely in Mali, Niger, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, southwestern Chad, Cameroon, western Central African Republic and Benin. Nowadays {{it occurs in}} much lower numbers mainly in protected areas of these countries. It is probably extinct in Gambia.|$|E
5|$|A. b. swaynei (Sclater, 1892) : Known as Swayne's <b>hartebeest.</b> Restricted to the {{southern}} Rift Valley in Ethiopia. It formerly occurred throughout the Rift Valley, and its range extended eastward into northwestern Somalia. It has disappeared from Somalia by 1930. Its populations are very low and on the decline.|$|E
5|$|The Bubal <b>hartebeest</b> {{has been}} {{declared}} extinct since 1994. German explorer Heinrich Barth, in his works of 1857, cites firearms and European intrusion among {{the reasons for the}} decrease in its numbers. It was extinct in Tunisia by the late 19th century. The last individual was shot in Missour (Algeria) in 1925.|$|E
5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the <b>hartebeest</b> provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the {{formidable}} horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the <b>hartebeest</b> to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E
5|$|Grasses {{generally}} comprise {{at least}} 80 {{percent of the}} hartebeest's diet, but they account for over 95 percent of their food in the wet season, October to May. Jasminum kerstingii {{is part of the}} hartebeest's diet {{at the start of the}} rainy season. Between seasons, they mainly feed on the culms of grasses. A study found that the <b>hartebeest</b> is able to digest a higher proportion of food than the topi and the wildebeest. In areas with scarce water, it can survive on melons, roots, and tubers.|$|E
5|$|The red <b>hartebeest</b> {{is listed}} as Least Concern. It is the most widespread, with {{increasing}} numbers after its reintroduction into protected and private areas. However, it has been extinct in Lesotho since the twentieth century. Its population {{is estimated to be}} over 130,000 (as of 2008), mostly in southern Africa. In Namibia, the largest population occurs in the Etosha National Park. A reintroduced population is flourishing in the Malolotja Nature Reserve (Swaziland), outside its range. However, numbers have seen a sharp fall in southwestern Botswana.|$|E
5|$|The western <b>hartebeest</b> {{is listed}} as Near Threatened. It has been {{eliminated}} from most of its range, including the southwestern savannas and Boucle du Baoulé National Park in Mali; southwestern Niger; southern Senegal; Gambia; Ivory Coast; Burkina Faso. Small populations survive in Bafing National Park and the area bounded by Bamako, Bougouni and Sikasso in Mali; Tamou Reserve in Niger; Niokolo-Koba National Park in Senegal; Comoé National Park in Ivory Coast; Diefoula forest and Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso; Pendjari National Park in Benin; and Bouba Njida, Bénoué, and Faro National Parks in Cameroon.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} {{supported}} monophyly {{in the family}} Bovidae (a group of organisms comprises an ancestral species and all their descendants). The number of subfamilies in Bovidae is disputed, with suggestions {{of as many as}} ten and as few as two subfamilies. However, molecular, morphological and fossil evidence indicates the existence of eight distinct subfamilies : Aepycerotinae (consisting of just the impala), Alcelaphinae (bontebok, <b>hartebeest,</b> wildebeest and relatives), Antilopinae (several antelopes, gazelles, and relatives), Bovinae (cattle, buffaloes, bison and other antelopes), Caprinae (goats, sheep, ibex, serows and relatives), Cephalophinae (duikers), Hippotraginae (addax, oryx and relatives) and Reduncinae (reedbuck and kob antelopes). In addition, three extinct subfamilies are known: Hypsodontinae (mid-Miocene), Oiocerinae (Turolian) and the subfamily Tethytraginae, which contains Tethytragus (mid-Miocene).|$|E
5|$|Primarily a nocturnal grazer, the bohor reedbuck {{may also}} feed at daytime. A {{study showed that}} feeding peaked at dawn and late afternoon. In the night, two feeding peaks were {{observed}} once again: at dusk and midnight. They traverse {{a long way from}} their daytime refuges while grazing. Seasonal differences in {{the amount of time spent}} while grazing in a particular area is possibly related to the availability and quality of grasses there. The bohor reedbuck often grazes in association with other grazers such as <b>hartebeest,</b> topi, puku and kob. In Kenyan farmlands, the reedbuck may feed on growing wheat and cereals.|$|E
