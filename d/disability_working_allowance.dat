30|$|Table  1 {{shows the}} most {{important}} features of the German model. The central pillars of the system are effectively corporist structures and a strong social partnership, a relatively generous social security system {{that is at the}} core of Bismarck-type social security (status-oriented and mainly financed by social contributions). The economy is geared toward export-oriented manufacturing, benefiting from a well-developed system of dual vocational training and a well-educated workforce. Fluctuations are relatively minor. Wage bargaining takes place at the intermediate (sectoral, regional) level; however, through wage-leadership (Lohnführerschaft), the outcomes at the aggregate level are rather similar. Although union coverage takes place only at the intermediate level, the strong role of unions in the bargaining process leads to a solidaristic wage policy (low wage dispersion). Federal institutions are engaged in active labor market policy and the buffering of labor market shocks through short-term <b>working</b> <b>allowances</b> and other instruments. The financing of companies depends on a house-bank system. Finally, the German system relies on a solid infrastructure, especially with respect to transport and logistics but also in relation to the legal system.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} turnover intentions in workers with mentally <b>disabilities</b> <b>working</b> in manufacturing industry. Methods: Participants were 147 workers with mentally disabled living in B-city and Y-city. The data were collected from September 1 st to November 30 th, 2011 using self-report questionnaires including measurements of turnover intentions, family support, work volition, working environment, job satisfaction and in-ternalized stigma. Data analysis was done using the SPSS/WIN 18. 0 program. Results: The average score for turn-over intention was 2. 9 ± 0. 7. Turnover intention was related to job satisfaction, working environment, family support and internalized stigma. The predicting factors for turnover intention were job satisfaction, internalized stigma and gender. Those factors accounted for 41. 9 % of turnover intention.

In a pilot study, we attempted to isolate the main factors involved in the parental decision either to keep the child at home or place the child by examining a sample comprised of 50 parents of children suffering severe intellectual disability studying in a special education school and 48 parents of adults with intellectual <b>disability</b> <b>working</b> in sheltered workshops.

While the decline may, in part, be explained by a parallel reduction in NHS inpatient beds for people with learning disabilities, unevenly distributed reductions in the number of community nurses in different English regions are harder to explain.

40|$|A {{clamping}} robot serving {{for several}} NC machines can recognize the best fit in manny blank parts. Forthermore, the shape information acquisition and pose measurment {{can be achieved}} by its computer vision system. The key question is that the clamping robot automatively choices the best fit part by statistical result of geometric dimension of all parts. The best fit part is the one that its length and its diameter are mostly proximate to the processing requirement. This choice method can save staff, reduce <b>working</b> <b>allowance,</b> and lessen finished cost. According to the shape information and position information, the robot can confirm the grab order, grab angle and finger joint distance. Firstly, the part image is smoothing by noise reduction technology, secondly, the feature points are extracted. The feature points present the information of the location of the mass center, the dip angle and diameter. Finally, the clamping robot can grab the most fit bar part by means of rotational motion, rectilinear motion, and finger open-close movement when the shape information and location information of the bar part have been confirmed. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

Results: The analysis suggests that workplaces could be further improved {{to meet the needs of}} employees with considerable scope for training within companies to raise awareness about employees’ needs, employers’ obligations and workplace adaptation. Conclusions: This snapshot suggests there is still a gap between intent and reality in workplace inclusion and further strategies are needed to improve the opportunities for employees with disabilities.

3000|$|... (i) Robert Boyer {{emphasizes}} the “strong complementarity between product strategy and human resource management” (Boyer 2006, p.  137). An important characteristic of labor {{relations in the}} German model is the priority of within-firm flexibility relative to external flexibility 5. The preference for retaining a qualified workforce even during severe recessions stems from the high importance of firm-specific capital, which originates from the needs of export-oriented diversified quality production. This product strategy requires the flexible use of equipment by highly skilled workers that is crucial for specialized firms facing highly volatile product demand in the world market. Labor hoarding during periods of slack demand is a suitable instrument, especially if this behavior is publically supported through generous short-term <b>working</b> <b>allowances.</b> However, labor hoarding in combination with massive reductions in working hours and temporary earnings moderation requires mechanisms of social partnership and trust. Work councils serve as intermediaries to arbitrate between the conflicting interests of management and workers. Hence, this institution {{plays a key role}} in organizing within-firm flexibility through various measures to stabilize employment. Moreover, a social partnership is also required in regard to fostering training measures and high workplace security standards. Traditionally, the system of well-functioning labor relations in Germany is especially developed in the manufacturing sector, where there are high levels of unionization and collective bargaining coverage.|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} {{intended}} to verify whether persons with mild or moderate intellectual disability in competitive work settings {{had a more}} articulate conception of working compared to those with {{the same type of}} intellectual disability in sheltered work settings, in contact only with other disabled workers. A second aim was to study their conception of leisure and the relationship between those two conceptions and other abilities, such as problem solving, decision making and self-determination abilities. Method: Thirty adults with intellectual disability − 15 inserted in competitive settings and 15 in sheltered settings – and 15 adults without disability, matched by age and gender, were administered a structured, open-ended questionnaire about their beliefs regarding working (Chaves et al., 2004). To assess the other dimensions, some instruments standardized for the Italian context were used. Results: Besides highlighting a series of significant differences between the three groups, participants with <b>disability</b> <b>working</b> in competitive settings displayed higher problem solving abilities, more sophisticated decisional strategies and anchorage to a more complex and articulate conception of working. Conclusions: Inclusion in a competitive work setting may influence conception of working in adults with disability and also the development and expression of their socio-cognitive abilities...|$|R
