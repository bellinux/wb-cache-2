5|$|Despite the <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> ancient Egyptian art, {{the styles}} of {{particular}} {{times and places}} sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After {{the invasion of the}} Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, Minoan-style frescoes were found in Avaris. The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were radically altered to conform to Akhenaten's revolutionary religious ideas. This style, known as Amarna art, was quickly and thoroughly erased after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms.|$|E

5|$|An inflationary phase, an {{additional}} phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around 10−33 seconds, was hypothesized in 1980 {{to account for}} several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models, such as the nearly perfect <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> the cosmic background radiation. Recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation {{have resulted in the}} first evidence for this scenario. However, there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios, which cannot be restricted by current observations. An even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe, prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity. An authoritative answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity, which has not yet been developed (cf. the section on quantum gravity, below).|$|E
5|$|Dinosaur {{evolution}} {{after the}} Triassic follows changes in vegetation {{and the location}} of continents. In the late Triassic and early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass Pangaea, and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores. Gymnosperm plants (particularly conifers), a potential food source, radiated in the late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. The general <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> dinosaurian faunas continued into the middle and late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of ceratosaurians, spinosauroids, and carnosaurians, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the Morrison Formation of North America and Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized sinraptorid theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like Mamenchisaurus. Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and pteridophytes were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential cheek-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians.|$|E
5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E

The ELR test is asymptotically optimal in the Bahadur sense when the alternative consists of sampling from a fixed number of components. Thus in some setups the ELR is superior to frequently used tests for exponential homogeneity which are based on the EM algorithm.

40|$|In the multi-fractal {{analysis}} of large scale matter distribution, the scale <b>of</b> transition to <b>homogeneity</b> {{is defined as}} the scale above which the fractal dimension of underlying point distribution is equal to the ambient dimension of the space in which points are distributed. With finite sized weakly clustered distribution of tracers obtained from galaxy redshift surveys it is difficult to achieve this equality. Recently we have defined the scale <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> to be the scale above which the deviation of fractal dimension from the ambient dimension becomes smaller than the statistical dispersion. In this paper we use the relation between the fractal dimensions and the correlation function to compute the dispersion for any given model in the limit of weak clustering amplitude. We compare the deviation and dispersion for the LCDM model and discuss the implication of this comparison for the expected scale <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> in the concordant model of cosmology. We estimate the upper limit to the scale <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> to be close to 260 Mpc/h for the LCDM model. Actual estimates of the scale <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> should be smaller than this as we have considered only statistical contribution to the dispersion in fractal dimension and we have ignored cosmic variance and contributions due to survey geometry and the selection function. We find that as long as non linear correction are insignificant, scale <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> as defined above does not change with epoch. The scale <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> depends very weakly on the choice of tracer of the density field. Thus the suggested definition of the scale <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> is fairly robust.
