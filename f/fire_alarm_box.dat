25|$|The {{entire process}} from initial {{notification}} until a unit is dispatched {{can take up}} to two (2) minutes, depending on the complexity of the call, the information provided by the caller(s) and the degree of other alarm activity in the office. If a dispatch office is so busy that its incoming telephone alarm lines are all busy or not answered within 30 seconds, the call is automatically transferred to another borough dispatch office. If an Emergency Reporting System (ERS) street <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>box</b> is not answered with 60 seconds, usually because all of the alarm receipt consoles are in use, the computer automatically dispatches an engine company to the location of the physical street <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fire was {{reported}} in room 306 by a nurse’s aide who pulled the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>box.</b> The alarm was received by the Chicago Fire Department at 11:43 A.M (CDT). Attempts {{to put out the}} fire by staff proved to no avail. The first fire engine arrived {{at the scene of the}} fire 3 minutes and 40 seconds later as nursing home staff evacuated the burning building. More fire engines arrived seconds later as smoke was seen rising from the top of the building. At 11:46 A.M., firefighters fighting the fire, discovered the third floor heavily laden with smoke and trapped elderly patients in wheelchairs. The victims were immediately removed from the burning building and were transported to nearby hospitals.|$|E
25|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>box</b> is {{an outdoor}} device used for notifying a fire {{department}} of a fire. Early boxes used the telegraph system {{and were the}} main method of calling the fire department to a neighborhood {{in the days before}} people had telephones. When the box is triggered, a spring-loaded wheel spins and taps out a signal onto the fire alarm telegraph wire, indicating the box number. The receiver at a fire station then can match the number to the neighborhood. The municipal fire alarm system got its start in Massachusetts. It was invented by Moses G. Farmer, an engineer, and Dr. William Channing, a Harvard-educated Bostonian. Their revolutionary creation was installed in 1851 and consisted of 40 miles of wire and 45 boxes in Boston.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> in Boston {{were locked}} to prevent false alarms, {{therefore}} delaying the Boston Fire Department by twenty minutes.|$|R
50|$|As {{applications}} of electricity broadened, Western Electric not only sold the electric bells and batteries, telegraph keys, <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> and hotel annunciators it originally manufactured, but also many items it purchased from other manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|Twenty-one days later, James J. Mulcahey {{was elected}} the first paid Chief of Department. Additionally, {{with the new}} paid fire {{department}} in place, the YFD Telegraph Bureau {{was established in the}} Palisade Avenue Firehouse. A large number of <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> signal <b>boxes</b> were placed in various locations throughout Yonkers. 38 <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> <b>Boxes</b> and 40 miles of telegraph wire made up the system. On September 1, 1896, the first roll call of the Yonkers Fire Department was called. In October 1897, 5 paid firemen were added to the firehouse on Vineyard Avenue (Station 2).|$|R
25|$|The {{nursing home}} was {{equipped}} with a manual and automatic fire alarm system that is connected directly to the fire alarm office of the Chicago Fire Department. The alarm system was designed to give out a code or box number of the alarm station when activated. The manual fire alarm system consisted of two pull fire alarm boxes located on each floor and one <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>box</b> located {{at the entrance of}} the building. The automatic fire alarms are activated by heat sensors which are located on the third floor, both stairways and in the storage closet. The automatic fire alarm system also consisted of smoke detectors. On the third floor, three fire extinguishers and two public address loud speakers were installed.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{address in}} the city is {{assigned}} a box number, based on the closest street, special building or highway box. The term [...] "box" [...] refers to the Fire Alarm Boxes, which at one time lined street corners {{and in front of}} certain buildings. Each <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> <b>Box</b> was given a specific number by the FDNY's Bureau of Communications. Even if the physical <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>box</b> is no longer at a specific address or street corner, the address or street corner is still assigned that fire alarm box's number. Box numbers can be duplicated in different boroughs, which is why they are always identified by borough name or numerical prefix on the computer (66 for Bronx and Manhattan, 77 for Brooklyn, 88 for Staten Island and 99 for Queens). If there is also a street address given to the dispatchers, the responding apparatus will get this information in the firehouse, over the air, and via their mobile data terminals in the rigs, in addition to the Box number. At present there are about 16,000 physical fire alarm street boxes in New York City, with many additional special building boxes and highway boxes, as well as [...] "dummy boxes" [...] used for special response assignments. In addition there are two airport crash boxes, one in the LaGuardia Tower, (Queens Box 37), and one in the JFK Tower, (Queens Box 269), which can only be activated by the personnel in these towers. When either box is sounded it brings an automatic second alarm (2–2) response of equipment, along with various special units.|$|E
2500|$|Fire Alarm Boxes are {{the second}} most common method of {{contacting}} the fire department. FDNY fire alarm boxes are located on certain street corners and in certain public buildings such as schools and hospitals, as well as along highways, on bridges, etc. These boxes primarily consist of two types: The first is the mechanical box (also commonly called a pull-box or a telegraph box) in which a spring-wound mechanism alternately opens and closes an electrical circuit, thereby rendering a coded number linked to the specific location of the box. Until the advent of the Starfire [...] "Computer-Assisted Dispatch System" [...] (CADS), dispatchers had to audibly count the taps from mechanical boxes when they were received in the central offices to decipher the number of the box that was pulled. Today, a [...] "Box Alarm Readout System" [...] (BARS) display handles that aspect of the job; The second type is the [...] "Emergency Reporting System" [...] (ERS) box that is equipped with buttons to notify either the FDNY or the NYPD, allowing either department's dispatcher to have direct voice communication with the reporting party. Beginning in the 1970s, ERS boxes started to replace mechanical boxes {{in many areas of the}} city, particularly where the number of false alarms involving mechanical boxes were high. In December 1994, then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and then-Fire Commissioner Howard Safir began a concerted effort to remove all of the mechanical and ERS boxes throughout New York City in a cost-cutting move. Facing stiff opposition from members of the city council, community groups, dispatchers and others, the move was blocked by court order as being discriminatory against the disabled (i.e., particularly the speech- and/or hearing-impaired) who – along with the poor – might otherwise have no dependable way to report fires and emergencies if the alarm boxes were eliminated. (In addition, unlike many other cities in the world, it was noted that 117 different languages and dialects are spoken by the residents of and visitors to the city. Since, unlike telephones, a <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>box</b> requires no verbal contact to indicate its exact location, a person would not have to be able to speak – at all – or to understand English in order to alert the FDNY to a fire or emergency. For this reason, as well, the boxes were recognized as being vital to New Yorkers' safety.) The court order to block the removal of the boxes provided a means for people to report emergencies during the 2003 blackout when other forms of communication were cut off. The fire alarm boxes, independent of outside power, continued to function the entire time.|$|E
5000|$|Manually {{actuated}} devices; {{also known}} as <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes,</b> manual pull stations, or simply pull stations, break glass stations, and (in Europe) call points. Devices for manual <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> activation are installed to be readily located (near the exits), identified, and operated. They are usually actuated by means of physical interaction, such as pulling a lever or breaking glass.|$|R
50|$|In 1926 Chief Dooley {{requested}} the department build its third fire station at 1022 W. Las Olas Blvd {{at a cost}} just over $21,000. This west side fire station, later renamed as station 8, served the department until 2004, when it was closed and its crews moved to the new station 2. It is being renovated as the Fort Lauderdale Fire Museum. Also in 1926 as part of Chief Dooley’s improvements to the fire department was {{the purchase of the}} department's first ladder truck, a 1926 Seagrave Fire Apparatus ladder truck with chemical equipment, at a cost of $9,500. The final improvement Chief Dooley implemented was the installation of a Gamewell <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> system with a central monitoring station, and 40 call boxes to be installed at locations throughout the city. By 1932, the number of <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> had increased to over 60, and was further increased in 1937 to 71 <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes,</b> with 15 more added to the growing city in 1941.|$|R

In 1876 a night-watchman was hired at $3 per month {{to look after the}} station at night and sound the alarm in case of a fire. This was the first paid employee of the fire department. In 1879 J.W. Verlander became the first Fire Chief, and J.M. Boone became chief in 1880 until 1895. In 1881, four Gamewell <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> <b>Boxes</b> were installed in the downtown area. These <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> were maintained by the telephone company. The system kept growing, and in 1928 construction was completed on a new Gamewell <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> System and <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> Headquarters were placed in operation in 1929, and remained in service until 7:32AM November 1, 1986. The Gamewell <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> System served the City of Huntington faithfully for 105 years. There never was a loss of life or major disaster because of a system malfunction.|$|R

The interior fire alarm systems of these buildings must {{be connected to the}} street <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>box.</b> Another requirement was that all schools where it was deemed vital would have sprinkler systems installed. However, nine months later, in September 1959, Fire Commissioner Quinn, when interviewed by WNBQ reporter Len O'Connor, admitted that although 400 of the 1040 schools in Chicago at that time had been deemed in critical need of sprinkler systems, only two had actually had sprinklers installed.|$|E
50|$|From their {{organization}} to 1894, {{the two companies}} operated independently although working close together. When Ansonia became a separate Town from Derby in 1889, the two fire departments continued to operate separately. The Borough of Ansonia financed the Eagle Hose, while the West Ansonia Fire District financed the Fountain Hose. Shortly after Ansonia was incorporated as a Town, the current street <b>box</b> <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> notification system was installed on the east side. The West Ansonia Fire District purchased a few <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> for their district to be tied into the system.|$|R

The Sockanosset Reservoir was begun, and Dexter Asylum was enlarged. A major hurricane struck the city on September 8, 1869, which caused much damage and flooding in downtown Providence.|$|R
5000|$|On July 17, 1980, all <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> <b>Boxes</b> {{were removed}} from street corners, as the city deemed it too costly to repair the system. On September 15, 1980, Station 2 (quarters of Engine Co. 302 and Engine Co. 305) on Vineyard Avenue was {{permanently}} closed due to structural issues. Because of this, Engine Co. 302 was relocated to Station 9 on Shonnard Place and Engine Co. 305 was relocated to Station 1-Fire Headquarters on New School Street.

25|$|As the {{manufacturing}} branch expanded, its production ability increased beyond {{the demand for}} phones, and it faced closure for several months a year without manufacturing other products. This was a problem because the Bell Telephone Company of Canada's (later renamed to Bell Canada) charter would {{not allow them to}} build other products. So in 1895, the Bell Telephone of Canada was required to spin off its manufacturing arm to build phones for sale to other companies, as well as other devices such as <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes,</b> police street call boxes, and fire department call equipment. This company was incorporated as the Northern Electric and Manufacturing Company Limited.|$|R
