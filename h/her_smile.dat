5|$|Aubrey Plaza as April Ludgate, a young apathetic intern at {{the parks}} department. She cares little for her internship, and often shows {{annoyance}} {{at having to}} complete tasks. Due to her rebellious and emotionless attitude, she is often annoyed by her co-workers, especially Leslie. She has a boyfriend named Derek, who is openly gay and dating another openly gay boy named Ben. Despite being in this relationship, April begins to develop a crush on Andy, as {{he is one of}} the few people that has the ability to make <b>her</b> <b>smile.</b> She goes so far as to accept a job as Ron's assistant just so she can stay in the parks department and see Andy.|$|E
5|$|The Dhumavati Tantra {{describes}} {{her as an}} old and ugly widow. She is thin, tall, unhealthy, and has a pale complexion. She is described as restless and wicked. Unadorned with jewellery, she wears old, dirty clothes and has dishevelled hair. Her eyes are fearsome, her nose long and crooked, {{and some of her}} long fang-like teeth have fallen out, leaving <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> with gaps. Her ears are ugly and rough; her breasts hang down. In one of her trembling hands, she holds a winnowing basket, while the other makes a boon-conferring gesture (varada-mudra) or knowledge-giving gesture (cinmudra). She rides in a horseless chariot bearing an emblem of a crow and a banner. She is astute and crafty, though. Always hungry and thirsty, Dhumavati initiates quarrels and invokes fear.|$|E

500|$|Suddenly embarrassed, the Tramp {{starts to}} shuffle away, {{but the girl}} steps to the shop door and again offers the flower, which he shyly accepts.

She runs her fingers along his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then catches her breath: [...] "You?" [...] The Tramp nods with an {{uncertain}} smile and asks, [...] "You can see now?" [...] The girl replies, [...] "Yes, I can see now" [...] and tearfully pulls his hand to her bosom. The uncertainty on the Tramp's face turns to joy as the film fades to black.|$|E

500|$|Appearing [...] "frail and {{slightly}} bent", {{she appeared in}} public {{for the opening of}} the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace (now Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum) in Yorba Linda, California on July 19, 1990. The dedication ceremony included 50,000 friends and well-wishers, as well as former Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Bush and their wives. The library includes a Pat Nixon room, a Pat Nixon amphitheater, and rose gardens planted with the red-black Pat Nixon Rose developed by a French company in 1972, when she was first lady. Pat also attended the opening of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California in November 1991. Former First Lady Barbara Bush reflected, [...] "I loved Pat Nixon, who was a sensational, gracious, and thoughtful First Lady", and at the dedication of the Reagan Library, Bush remembered, [...] "There was one sad thing. Pat Nixon did not look well at all. Through <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> you could see that she was in great pain and having a terrible time getting air into her lungs." ...|$|E
500|$|Lawson {{has become}} renowned for her flirtatious manner of presenting, {{although}} she argues [...] "It's {{not meant to}} be flirtatious. ... I don't have the talent to adopt a different persona. It's intimate, not flirtatious". The perceived overt sexuality of her presentation style has led to Lawson being called the [...] "queen of food porn". Many commentators have alluded to Lawson's attractiveness, and she was once named as one of the world's most beautiful women. She has been referred to as [...] "stunningly beautiful, warm, honest, likeable and amazingly normal", as well as being described as having [...] "flawless skin, perfect white teeth, a voluptuous body, ample height and lots of lush, brown hair". Nigella Lawson has been voted, Sexiest Celebrity Chef. [...] The media have also noted Lawson's ability to engage with both male and female viewers; The Guardian wrote, [...] "Men love her {{because they want to be}} with her. Women love her because they want to be her". [...] The chef Gary Rhodes said that viewers were attracted to <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> rather than her cooking. Despite often being labelled as a domestic goddess, she insists that she exhibits very few of the qualities associated with the title.|$|E
500|$|Daydream {{proved to}} be one of the bestselling and most {{acclaimed}} albums of 1995. When the Grammy Award nominees were announced, and Daydream was nominated for six different awards, critics began raving how it would be [...] "cleaning up" [...] that year. The 38th Annual Grammy Awards were held on February 28, 1996 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Carey, being a multiple award nominee, was one of the headlining performers. Together with Boyz II Men, she sang a live rendition of [...] "One Sweet Day", to a very positive response. However, as the award winners were announced one by one, Carey watched as her name was not called up even once. Daydream had lost all of its six nominations, shocking most critics who branded it the [...] "album of the year". With every passing loss, the television cameras continued to zoom on Carey's face, who was finding it more difficult to retain <b>her</b> <b>smile.</b> By the end of the night, Carey had not won a single award. The disappointment on her face was painfully obvious. While Carey was nominated again the following year, she did not perform again until the 2006 ceremony, when she was nominated for eight awards (winning three) for The Emancipation of Mimi.|$|E

500|$|While Leng {{considers}} that, lyrically and musically, [...] "Something" [...] reflects [...] "doubt and {{striving to}} attain an uncertain goal", author Ian Inglis writes of the confident statements that Harrison makes throughout regarding his feelings for Boyd. Referring to {{lines in the}} song's verses, Inglis writes: [...] "there is a clear and mutual confidence in the reciprocal nature of their love; he muses that [...] 'attracts me like no other lover' and 'all I {{have to do is}} think of her,' but he is equally aware that she feels the same, that 'somewhere in <b>her</b> <b>smile,</b> she knows.'" [...] Similarly, when Harrison sings in the middle eight that [...] "You're asking me will my love grow / I don't know, I don't know", Inglis interprets the words as [...] "not an indication of uncertainty, but a wry reflection that his love is already so complete that it may simply be impossible for it to become any greater". Richie Unterberger of AllMusic describes [...] "Something" [...] as [...] "an unabashedly straightforward and sentimental love song" [...] written at a time [...] "when most of the Beatles' songs were dealing with non-romantic topics or presenting cryptic and allusive lyrics even when they were writing about love".|$|E
500|$|In each of {{the months}} leading up to its release, Hunt {{promoted}} the album by releasing new songs as free downloads. They were made available through music websites, blogs, and his own website. The song [...] "June" [...] was released through The Huffington Post on June 15. Excluded from the album, it is a somber, jazz-styled track that contrasts the album's raw aesthetic, with upright bass and blue chord changes. Hunt explained the song to be [...] "about a somber girl. I'm identifying with her somberness, but trying to make <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> ... he June bloom has set in her and she's struggling with it." [...] On July 7, Hunt released another non-album track, [...] "The Savage, Sincere L of P", on Pastes website. It features a soulful rock style and lyrics about the pleasures of the flesh and [...] "the savage, sincere look of pleasure". The album's lead single, [...] "Eyes Like Pearls", was released on September 9 via Hunt's Facebook page. Hunt also promoted the album with a 20-date national headlining tour, his first national tour since 2008. It began on September 19 at Webster Hall in New York City and concluded on October 13 at Yoshi's in San Francisco. He performed with members of his session band, drummer Ruth Price and keyboardist Peter Dyer, as well as guitarist Douglas Showalter. Prior to the tour, they had played at the 21st NAACP Theatre Awards gala on August 29.|$|E

[...] She also said Spears performed with [...] "a naughty, free-spirited attitude", as though she [...] "had invited 900 friends to her dirty little dance party, and too bad for you if you couldn't roll with the fun." [...] SuChin Pak, also from MTV stated the show was [...] "no huge revelation", explaining, [...] "It {{was not the kind of}} show that says: 'She's back. She's going to come out with the biggest album of her career.' Nor did it say that she's lost forever and we'll never see the old Britney back again. These are all really tiny baby steps." [...] Thomas K. Arnold of USA Today said the show [...] "turned out to be more rehearsal than comeback", although [...] "all those post-rehab workouts were worth the effort." [...] On May 2, 2007, scalpers outside the House of Blues in San Diego were selling tickets with a face value of $35 for prices between $200 and $500. Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "her 'comeback'– if you want to call it that– cemented Spears' place as pop music's reigning drama queen, capable of capturing worldwide tabloid headlines with a bare minimum of creative expenditure." ...|$|E

500|$|Television {{critics have}} responded {{positively}} to the pairing. Robert Canning of IGN {{said of the}} episode [...] "Silly Love Songs": [...] "The absolute best part of [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] was Puckerman's unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes. Actress Ashley Fink has been fantastic in her small role, delivering great one-liners with ease. She was equally strong in this, the first episode to truly give Lauren a larger role and fill out her character more. Heck, {{it was nice to}} even see <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> a few times. The casting on Glee has either been very smart or very lucky since so many background characters have shined as they've been given bigger parts. The Lauren and Puck pairing came with a lot of laughs, but just as much heart. Puck singing Queen's [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls," [...] induced a chuckle at first, then some toe tapping. But it was Lauren's reaction that truly made the moment: 'That's the first song you've sung to me and it made me feel like crap.' I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented: [...] "For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self-professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that “bad” at all. But it’s always fun to watch Salling sing, and it’s always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings." [...] In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than before, but Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes [...] "as endearing as they are unrealistic", and E! Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that [...] "the ice around [...] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Aristocratic cool", {{known as}} sprezzatura, has existed in Europe for centuries, {{particularly}} when relating to frank amorality and love or illicit pleasures behind closed doors; Raphael's [...] "Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione" [...] and Leonardo da Vinci's [...] "Mona Lisa" [...] are classic examples of sprezzatura. The sprezzatura of the Mona Lisa {{is seen in}} both <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> and the positioning of her hands. Both the smile and hands are intended to convey her grandeur, self-confidence and societal position. Sprezzatura means, literally, disdain and detachment. It {{is the art of}} refraining from the appearance of trying to present oneself in a particular way. In reality, of course, tremendous exertion went into pretending not to bother or care.|$|E

Her eyes mournfully contemplated the cross during the hymn. As the people sang the [...] "Ave Maris Stella," [...] the cross vanished and <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> returned, though {{with a touch of}} melancholy. Two small white crosses then appeared on her shoulders before Our Lady disappeared behind a cloud. As the night prayers came to a close, the apparition ended. It was about nine o'clock.

2500|$|Another story {{gives an}} account of this wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm, in 1585. According to legend she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who {{displayed}} their skills next to her carriage {{were able to make}} <b>her</b> <b>smile.</b> Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions - the forerunner of today’s fairs - between the end of the 19th century {{and the beginning of the}} 20th century. During this time the children who did the cart wheeling found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted [...] "för eene Penning schlage ich das Rad“ (cartwheel for a penny). The Jan Wellem monument returned to Düsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and the cartwheeling boys.|$|E
