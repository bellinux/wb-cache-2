25|$|But {{after seven}} months <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> out of Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer {{had come up}} with a first-draft script which I felt was a decent {{distillation}} of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised Dune was {{going to take a lot}} more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him the Dune script was his.|$|E

Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around where my mouth {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet and I found myself looking at easily {{one of the most}} extraordinary scenes I had ever, ever experienced. When <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> down {{through a hole in the}} ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E

So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> the Joe part.

She and her lifelong partner, Kay Tobin (also known as Kay Tobin Lahusen; born 1930) met in 1961 at a picnic in Rhode Island. Gittings described how they began: [...] "We hit it off, we started courting. I flew to Boston [...] and got off the plane with a big bunch of flowers in my hand. I couldn't resist.

500|$|On 30 March, {{four days}} after the episode was {{originally}} broadcast in the UK, the BBC announced that another full series had been commissioned. On the same day, the BBC released a statement, apparently from Eccleston, saying that he would be leaving the role at Christmas, for fear of being typecast. The BBC later revealed this was not an official statement from Eccleston, whom they had failed to contact before responding to press questions after the story broke; the mis-quote was re-used in other media. Eccleston later said, [...] "They handled it very badly, but they issued an apology and <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> it" [...] in an 2010 interview. After it was announced that Eccleston was leaving the BBC said that they were in talks with David Tennant to take over the role and he became the bookmakers' favourite, with odds at 1/10 and William Hill refusing to take any more bets on who would be case as the new Doctor. A BBC spokesman said that they had [...] "hoped, rather than expected" [...] that Eccleston would continue in the role.|$|E

During high school, he would skip classes to play video games at an Internet cafe with friends; on this topic, PewDiePie has commented, [...] "Sweden has a great culture around gaming." [...] In 2008, he graduated from Göteborgs Högre Samskola. He then went on to pursue a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology, but left the university in 2011. On his decision, PewDiePie has stated, [...] "Thinking about it now, it was utterly absurd. To get into Chalmers for industrial economics you need straight A's, but somehow I was happier selling hot dogs and making my own gaming-videos." [...] While his reason for leaving Chalmers has often been reported as a want to focus on his YouTube career, in 2017, PewDiePie clarified, [...] "Why does everyone get this story wrong?

500|$|Led by league MVP Tittle, {{who passed}} for over 3,000yards and 36 touchdowns, the Giants had an 11–3 record in 1963. They set what remains the NFL's {{record for most}} points in a 14-game season by scoring 448. They {{advanced}} to face the Chicago Bears in the NFL championship game. On an icy field, New York's defense played well, but Chicago's newly invented zone defense intercepted Tittle five times (including one returned for a score) and injured Tittle {{in the first half}} (though he finished the game). Several Giants players including linebacker Huff pleaded with Sherman to replace the hobbled Tittle, who the players felt was pressing and committing too many turnovers, from playing the second half. Sherman however, had little alternative. [...] "The old man kept saying 'I can do it. I feel a little better'" [...] Sherman recalled. [...] "We had a young quarterback (Glynn Griffing), he had gone to get married a couple of weeks earlier but failed to come back in the days he said he would. We couldn't use him." [...] The Giants defense, led by Hall of Famer Huff, held the Bears in check, but they lost 14–10, their third straight NFL Championship Game defeat. New York had a chance to take a 14–0 lead in the first quarter but wide receiver Del Shofner dropped a potential touchdown in the end zone, a drop he said in 2010, that he feels would have won the Giants the game. [...] "I was alone in the end zone—ball right into my hands, nobody around me—and <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> the ball...as good a defense as we had that year, I don't think the Berar would have ever come back from being down 14–0." [...] On the next play, Tittle threw an interception to Chicago linebacker Larry Morris, which he returned to the New York five-yard line. Two plays later, the Bears tied the game.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{sometimes}} said that each islander (or his family) had a jumper {{with a unique}} design, so that if he drowned and was found, maybe weeks later, on the beach, his body could be identified.

However, even in the play, there is no reference to any decorative or Aran-type pattern.
