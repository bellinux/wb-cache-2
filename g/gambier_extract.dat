40|$|Gambier (Uncaria gambier) {{is known}} to have {{antioxidant}} properties, and some studies have attributed it to the presenceof polyphenols such as catechin. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the potential of various gambiers availablein Indonesian market as a scavenger of reactive free radicals and evaluate its anti-hyperglycemic activity as α-glucosidase inhibitor. Isolation of catechin was done by extraction method with technical grade of ethyl acetate assolvent. Analysis of catechin in the dried <b>gambier</b> <b>extract</b> was carried out with TLC method. The molecular weight andcontent of catechin of dried <b>gambier</b> <b>extract</b> was determined by analyzing its mass spectra and spectrophotometer,respectively. The free radical scavenging activity of catechin of the resultant extracts was measured by using 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) as stable free radical compound. The anti-hyperglycemic activity of catechin ofethyl acetate extracts was analyzed as α-glucosidase inhibitor. The result showed that various gambiers available in themarket are very active as antioxidant, indicated by IC 50 of catechin of ethyl acetate extracts which were 4. 6 to 18. 2 μg/mL for DPPH inhibition. The IC 50 for α-glucosidase inhibition is ranged from 40. 45 to 52. 43 μg/mL, so they can beclassified as anti-diabetic...|$|E

Ethyl acetate fraction of <b>gambier</b> leaves <b>extract</b> (Uncaria gambir Roxb.) contains catechin of secondary metabolites which have potency {{to be used as}} antihyperlipidemic. This study aimed to examine the antihyperlipidemic effect of ethyl acetate fraction of <b>gambier</b> leaves <b>extract</b> in vivo. Thirty six males of Sprague Dawley strain, 2, 5 months old, were randomly divided into six groups: normal group, negative group (distilled water), positive group (simvastatin 2 mg/ 200 g bw), dose I (5 mg/ 200 g bw fraction), II (10 mg/ 200 g bw fraction) and III (20 mg/ 200 g bw fraction) groups. Rats were induced with high cholesterol and saturated fat feeds for 28 days, except in the normal group. Furthermore, rats were given the treatment for 28 days. The results showed when compared than negative control, dose III reduced of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL levels and increased HDL level (p 0, 05).

40|$|Gambir (Uncaria gambir Roxb) is a {{plant that}} has many {{benefits}} to health such as antioxidants, antihiperlipidemia and antibacterial. Gambir extract derived from the leaves and twigs of Uncaria gambir Roxb {{through the process of}} removing the sap by being boiled, squeezed / compressed, liquid is deposited, molded and dried. During the plant grows, then harvest, process, stored and distributed, it is might contaminated with microbes or chemicals. Based on the requirement issued by BPOM No. 12, 2014 about Traditional Medicine Quality Requirements, it requires us to test the extract that we will use. To determine the contaminant of all three gambir extracts, we tested against yeast fungi figures, total plate count, aflatoxin and heavy metals. Besides that, we also determine content of active compound of methyl gallate which has benefits as an antioxidant with a densitometer. the result shows, there were contaminants that exceeded the requirements. Contaminants that exceeds the requirement are number of fungi yeasts (7, 5. 10 - 6) and aflatoxin G 2 (47, 38. 10 6 ppb) in <b>gambier</b> <b>extract</b> quality 3.

The existing commercialized mouthwash have quite a high alcohol. The use of a mouthwashes with alcohol contain more than of 25 % will increase the risk of generating. mouth and throat cancers up to 50 %. The objective of this research using to find the type and bestconcentration of gambier in the mouthwash formula, so that it could be have accepted by consumer. The experiment was in complete random factorial design with two factors andthree levels. The first factor was gambier concentration (1 %, 2 %, 3 %, 4 %, and 5 %), and the second factor was tud of storage (at weekly until one month). Result showed that gambier with low catechin (25 - 35 %) and tannins (60 - 65 %) had the highest resistance to Streptococcus mutans (up 41. 77 %). The antibacterial activity of gambier mouthwash was in the range 20. 45 - 43. 24 %, while the control (Pepsodent Herbal) was 28. 25 %. The pH of gambier mouthwash was 4. 14 - 4. 38, while that of the control was 4. 66. The viscosity of the mouthwash was 2. 75 - 4. 75 cP, while the control was 7. 25 cP.
