In the Milk River Natural Area, management policy is suppression of wildfires, with prescribed controlled burns allowed for ecosystem maintenance purposes to manage the grassland in its climax state. Campfires are permitted but discouraged. Following the 2007 wildfire, inventories were conducted which showed an increase in species richness and also good recovery of native species with little invasion of exotics. Invasive weed species that have been found in the area, such as nodding thistle, are being controlled by spot spraying and hand picking. Larger species like the Russian olive are cut down and spot-treated.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the late}} 1800s, large herds of bison grazed the area {{until they were}} extirpated by human hunting, and cattle have — to a degree — taken their place as grazers, {{maintaining}} the <b>grassland</b> <b>ecosystem</b> in a mix of grazed and ungrazed patches. Pronghorn (Antilocapra Americana) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are also present on the grasslands along with deer mice, voles, and Richardson's ground squirrel, an important food source for the ferruginous hawk and occasional burrow host to the burrowing owl. The formerly extirpated and subsequently reintroduced swift fox (Vulpes velox), currently listed as endangered provincially and downgraded to threatened nationally in 2009, is resident as well. Swift foxes were originally abundant across the prairies, but population declines caused by land use conversion, trapping, hunting, predation by domestic dogs, competition with coyotes, and rodent control programs led to their elimination from Alberta in 1938 and declared extirpated in 1978. The swift fox was reintroduced to Canada in 1983 from the progeny of a captive breeding program using Colorado and South Dakota stock, a controversial but relatively successful initiative. The current population is estimated at 647 foxes in Canada as of 2006, but predation by coyotes and golden eagles {{continues to be a}} limiting factor, with golden eagles causing 75% of the deaths of swift foxes in 1997. In addition, due to their small size and inability to see above tall vegetation, and their avoidance of agricultural lands and the associated chemical spraying which reduces their insect prey, swift foxes appear to be habitat specialists preferring shortgrass native prairie and land use conversion to agriculture is a continued threat. The area's woodland habitat is home to a herd of elk, along with porcupines, cottontail rabbits, and white-tailed deer.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{belonging}} to the Lost River Ranch lease, the land that now comprises the Milk River Natural Area was grazed infrequently and was therefore deleted from the grazing lease under the Public Lands Act in 1978 and 1979. Some resource exploration has occurred {{over the years and}} several wells were drilled but have subsequently been abandoned. Coal was also briefly mined but due to the area's remoteness was also abandoned. The Milk River Natural Area and Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve were established with the intent [...] "to protect and maintain the ecological and aesthetic character of a representative example of the Mixed Grassland Natural Region with minimal human interference;" [...] specifically, protecting ecological diversity and processes, native species and habitats, rare and significant natural features, recreation, education, and scientific research. Management interference is intended to be minimal and [...] "let nature take its course" [...] wherever possible, while managing some ecological processes such as fires and controlled grazing. A balance of grazing regimes is important to maintain the combination of short and medium grasses defining the dry mixedgrass natural subregion. Cattle do not graze {{in the same way as}} the now-extirpated bison did, but have been used to simulate natural processes. Grazing management maintains the <b>grassland</b> <b>ecosystem</b> in its climax state, but overgrazing must be avoided to prevent soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. Rangeland health assessments aid this goal by periodically evaluating the area's ecosystem health, including measuring factors such as grazing intensity, weed occurrence, species composition, site stability, and soil and plant health. The 2011 rangeland survey concluded that the Milk River Natural Area overall is in excellent health and meeting its management goals, and that plant community health and grazing management were found to be far exceeding provincial standards.|$|E

Two common grass leaf litter types of contrasting lignin:N were placed at each site under screens that either passed all solar radiation wavelengths or passed all but UV wavelengths. Decomposition was generally faster when litter was exposed to UV radiation across all three sites. In contrast to our hypothesis, the contribution of photodegradation in the decomposition process was not consistently greater at the more arid sites or for litter with higher lignin content. Additionally, at the most arid site, exposure to UV radiation could not explain decomposition rates that were faster than expected given climate constraints or lack of N immobilization by decomposing litter.

40|$|This review summarises recent {{information}} on beneficial roles that soil nematodes {{play in the}} cycling of carbon and other plant nutrients in <b>grassland</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> In particular, {{we focus on the}} role of the two dominant functional groups of nematodes, namely the microbial- and root-feeders, and how their activities may enhance soil ecosystem-level processes of nutrient cycling and, ultimately, plant productivity in managed and unmanaged <b>grassland</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> We report recent experiments which show that low amounts of root herbivory by nematodes can increase the allocation of photoassimilate carbon to roots, leading to increased root exudation and microbial activity in the rhizosphere. The effects of these interactions on soil nutrient cycling and plant productivity are discussed. Evidence is presented to show that the feeding activities of microbial-feeding nematodes can enhance nutrient mineralization and plant nutrient uptake in grasslands, but that these responses are highly species-specific and appear to be strongly regulated by higher trophic groups of fauna (top-down regulation). We recommend that future studies of the roles of nematodes in <b>grasslands</b> <b>ecosystems</b> should consider these more complex trophic interactions and also the effects of species diversity of nematodes on soil ecosystem-level processes...|$|R

Although plant litter decomposition is primarily driven by plant litter chemistry, temperature, and precipitation these factors have failed to fully explain decomposition patterns in arid and semiarid <b>grassland</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> In my dissertation, I tested the hypothesis that solar radiation, particularly in the UV range (280 - 400 nm) contributes to the decomposition process in these systems via the process of photodegradation. In a three-year field study in the semiarid shortgrass steppe in Colorado, I examined whether photodegradation by UV radiation {{played a role in}} plant litter decomposition and whether the role of photodegradation in the decomposition process was affected by plant litter chemistry and precipitation. In a series of laboratory experiments, I examined the pathways by which mass is lost via photodegradation. In a two-year cross-site field experiment, I examined whether photodegradation may explain the difference in litter decomposition patterns among mesic, semiarid, and arid <b>grassland</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> The combined results of this research show that photodegradation is an important process in plant litter decomposition in mesic <b>grassland</b> <b>ecosystems</b> as well as arid and semiarid <b>grassland</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> accounting for up to 50 % of litter mass loss. Results also show that litter mass loss via photodegradation is the result of photochemical production of carbon dioxide, which can be up to 4 g C m- 2 y- 1 in arid ecosystems.
