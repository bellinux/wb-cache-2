5|$|The Western Australian gold rushes of the 1890s {{resulted}} <b>in</b> <b>strong</b> economic growth, and {{a massive}} increase in population: doubling from almost 50,000 in 1891 to more than 100,000 by 1895, and expanding to 184,000 by 1901. The influx included desperate, dishonest people, from elsewhere in Australia and overseas, and Fremantle Prison was soon overcrowded.|$|E

2500|$|From its {{inception}} R has been criticised {{for being an}} agency not answerable {{to the people of}} India (R reports to Prime Minister only). Fears arose that it could turn into the KGB of India. Such fears were kept at bay by the R's able leadership (although detractors of R and especially the Janata Party have accused the agency of letting itself be used for terrorising and intimidating opposition during the 1975–1977 Emergency). The main controversy which has plagued R in recent years is over bureaucratisation of the system with allegations about favouritism in promotions, corruption, ego clashes, no financial accountability, inter-departmental rivalry etc. R also suffers from ethnic imbalances in the officer level. Noted security analyst and former Additional Secretary B. Raman has criticised the agency for its asymmetric growth; [...] "while being <b>strong</b> <b>in</b> its capability for covert action it is weak in its capability for intelligence collection, analysis and assessment. <b>Strong</b> <b>in</b> low and medium-grade intelligence, weak <b>in</b> high-grade intelligence. <b>Strong</b> <b>in</b> technical intelligence, weak <b>in</b> human intelligence. <b>Strong</b> <b>in</b> collation, weak <b>in</b> analysis. <b>Strong</b> <b>in</b> investigation, weak <b>in</b> prevention. <b>Strong</b> <b>in</b> crisis management, weak in crisis prevention." ...|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on July10. Once {{north of the}} Greater Antilles, convective growth {{and the development of}} a well-defined surface low led to the formation of a tropical depression just south of Acklins Island by 06:00UTC on July22. Amid a brief reprieve <b>in</b> <b>strong</b> upper-level winds, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie as it crossed Ragged Island around 23:15UTC that day. It later traversed Andros Island at peak intensity, with sustained winds of 45mph (75km/h), and weakened slightly before moving ashore near Elliott Key, Florida, with winds of 40mph (65km/h) on July23. Bonnie weakened to a tropical depression as it crossed South Florida, and the persistent effects of strong wind shear prevented intensification in the Gulf of Mexico. The cyclone degenerated into a remnant low by 00:00UTC on July25 and later moved into southeastern Louisiana before dissipating later that day.|$|E
5|$|About {{twelve hours}} after {{reaching}} typhoon status, Oliwa began to undergo unexpected explosive deepening. In a 24‑hour period, the JTWC assessed the typhoon as nearly doubling in intensity, from 85 to 160mph (140 to 260km/h 1-min winds), while the pressure dropped 69mbar {{to a minimum}} of 898mbar; based on the estimated intensity, the JTWC classified Oliwa as a super typhoon. The JMA, which is the official agency of the western Pacific, assessed Oliwa as reaching a peak of 115mph (185km/h 10-min winds), with a pressure of 915mbar. Around that time, satellite imagery indicated a possible eyewall mesovorticy, which is a small scale rotational feature found in the eyewall of an intense tropical cyclone. Additionally, concentric eyewalls developed {{in the center of}} Oliwa, which typically occur <b>in</b> <b>strong</b> typhoons.|$|E
5|$|Aged 76, {{he faced}} various ailments, and {{although}} exhibiting continued energy, he felt isolated and lonely. He often entertained celebrities, such as Michael Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, and the Spice Girls, and befriended ultra-rich businessmen, like Harry Oppenheimer of Anglo-American {{as well as}} Queen Elizabeth II on her March 1995 state visit to South Africa, resulting <b>in</b> <b>strong</b> criticism from ANC anti-capitalists. Despite his opulent surroundings, Mandela lived simply, donating {{a third of his}} R 552,000 annual income to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, which he had founded in 1995. Although dismantling press censorship, speaking out in favour of freedom of the press, and befriending many journalists, Mandela was critical of much of the country's media, noting that it was overwhelmingly owned and run by middle-class whites and believing that it focused too heavily on scaremongering about crime.|$|E

5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results <b>in</b> <b>strong</b> latitudinal wind shear.|$|E

His main opponent Roman Dmowski by contrast called for an independent state of Poland narrowed to the lands of historical Crown and founded mainly on an ethnically Polish demos and Roman Catholic identity.|$|E
