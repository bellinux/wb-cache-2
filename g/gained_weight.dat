In the last week of April 1555, Elizabeth was released from house arrest, and called to court as a witness to the birth, which was expected imminently. According to Giovanni Michieli, the Venetian ambassador, Philip may have planned to marry Elizabeth in the event of Mary's death in childbirth, but {{in a letter to his}} brother-in-law, Maximilian of Austria, Philip expressed uncertainty as to whether his wife was pregnant.|$|E
5|$|In the 1923 season, {{under the}} eye of the county's coach, James Iremonger, Larwood {{concentrated}} on building his physique and on learning bowling skills. He grew a few inches in height, although he remained short for a fast bowler, and under Iremonger's regime of diet and exercise he <b>gained</b> <b>weight.</b> Besides his physical development, he learned by incessant practice various bowling arts, among them accuracy in line and length, variation of pace and grip, and deviating the ball in the air to produce swing. That year he played intermittently for the county's Second XI, and in a match against Lancashire Seconds took 8 wickets for 44 runs.|$|E

5|$|Betty has <b>gained</b> <b>weight</b> {{over the}} past few months, causing her self-worth to drop and her sex life with Henry to flatline.

After a routine examination, he finds a possibly cancerous lump in Betty's throat. Betty returns home in a hysteric fever. She calls Don, who reassures her. Betty begins to confront the legacy of her life and the effect her death would have on her loved ones. Several days later, the doctor calls back to tell her the tumor is benign. Henry holds a despondent Betty in his arms. She ponders her life as simply a sad, fat housewife.|$|E

His most common winning technique was yori-kiri, or force out, although he also relied on pull-down techniques such as hataki-komi and hiki-otoshi. He was fond of throwing moves (nage). He was very adept at using tripping techniques which he had gained from his experience in judo, winning 17 career bouts by uchigake (inside leg trip). He also used the extremely rare trip nimaigeri (ankle kicking twist down) on eleven occasions, although he was not credited with the technique in the top division until May 2011 in a win over Shōtenrō. He also appeared to employ it to defeat ōzeki Kotoōshū in March 2007, but the kimarite was given as shitatenage (underarm throw) instead.|$|E
