5|$|More than 50 {{species of}} exotic mammals have been {{recorded}} in South Florida, at least 19 of which are self-sustaining. Colonies of feral mammals are established in or around the Everglades, including dogs, pigs, and cats. Wild animals native {{to other parts of}} the U.S. have also been established including nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus Linnaeus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and <b>jaguarundi</b> (Herpailurus yaguarondi).|$|E
5|$|The cheetah's closest {{relatives}} are the cougar (Puma concolor) and the <b>jaguarundi</b> (P.yagouaroundi). These three species together form the Puma lineage, {{one of the}} eight lineages of Felidae. The sister group of the Puma lineage is a clade of smaller Old World cats that includes the genera Felis, Otocolobus and Prionailurus.|$|E
5|$|Although the cheetah is an African cat, {{molecular}} {{evidence indicates}} that the three species of the Puma lineage evolved in North America two to three million years ago, where they possibly had a common ancestor during the Miocene. They possibly diverged from this ancestor 8.25 million years ago. The cheetah diverged from the puma and the <b>jaguarundi</b> around 6.7 million years ago. A genome study concluded that cheetahs experienced two genetic bottlenecks in their history, the first about 100,000 years ago and the second about 12,000 years ago, greatly lowering their genetic variability. These bottlenecks may {{have been associated with}} migrations across Asia and into Africa (with the current African population founded about 12,000 years ago), and/or with a depletion of prey species {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Being in {{the genus}} Acinonyx, the {{morphology}} of the cheetah differs notably {{from the big}} cats (genus Panthera). The face and the jaw are unusually shortened and the sagittal crest is poorly developed, possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed. In fact, the skull resembles that of the smaller cats. Another point of similarity to the small cats is the long and flexible spine, {{in contrast to the}} stiff and short one of other large felids. A 2001 study of felid morphology stated that the truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in the cheetah at a relatively younger age than other felids could be a major reason for the peculiar morphology of the cheetah. Interestingly, the cheetah appears to show convergent evolution with canids in morphology as well as behaviour. For example, the cheetah has a relatively long snout, long legs and deep chest, tough foot pads and blunt, semi-retractable claws; moreover, its hunting behaviour resembles that of canids. In the 2001 study, it was observed that the claws of cheetah have features intermediate between those of felids and the wolf. In the Puma lineage, the cheetah's skull morphology {{is similar to that of}} the pumaboth have short, wide skullswhile that of the <b>jaguarundi</b> is different.|$|E
25|$|The Belize Zoo {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of mammals, {{including}} Belize's national animal, the Baird's tapir, and the five wildcat species found in Belize: (jaguar, puma, ocelot, margay, and <b>jaguarundi).</b> Other mammals include white-tailed deer, red brocket, spider monkey, howler monkey, greater grison, white-lipped peccary, collared peccary, and kinkajou.|$|E
25|$|The wild canids {{found in}} Brazil are the maned wolf, bush dog, hoary fox, short-eared dog, crab-eating fox and pampas fox. The felines found in Brazil are the jaguar, the puma, the margay, the ocelot, the oncilla, and the <b>jaguarundi.</b> Other notable animals include the giant anteater, several {{varieties}} of sloths and armadillos, coati, giant river otter, tapir, peccaries, marsh deer, Pampas deer, and capybara (the world's largest existing rodent). There are around 75 primate species, including the howler monkey, the capuchin monkey, and the squirrel monkey, the marmoset, and the tamarin.|$|E
25|$|Five {{terrestrial}} ecoregions extend {{across the}} state. The Southern Pacific dry forests {{lie on the}} southern slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur, extending from the coast up to 1400 meters elevation. The forests are predominantly deciduous during the long dry season. The Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests occupy the higher slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur. These forests harbor a great diversity of species, including many endemic orchids, butterflies, and birds. The Balsas dry forests lie in the basin of the Balsas River, north of the Sierra Madre del Sur, and are notable for the diversity of mammal species, including <b>jaguarundi,</b> coati, ocelot, and collared peccary. The northernmost {{part of the state}} includes portions of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests, which occupy the mountainous northern rim of the Balsas basin. The Mexican South Pacific mangroves are found in coastal lagoons along the coast of Michoacán, Guerrero, and Oaxaca.|$|E
25|$|Information about {{fish species}} is scarce {{but at least}} four {{protected}} species have been detected. According to a CONANP study in 2007, there are 12 species of reptile here under protection, including the river crocodile (Crocodylus acutus), and one threatened species, the Yucatán banded gecko (Coleonyx elegans). Birds {{are the most common}} type of animal in the park, with about 195 species documented. Six of these species are threatened and 17 are subject to special protection. One threatened bird species in the park is the great curassow (Crax rubra). Relatively abundant species include Actitus macularia, Dendrocygna autumnalis, Egretta caerulea, Egretta thula, Tachybaptus dominicus and Coragyps atratus, all of which are associated with bodies of water. There have been 53 species of mammals detected recently in the park, of which two are considered threatened, two in danger and two subject to special protection. Endangered and threatened species include the spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), <b>jaguarundi,</b> ocelot, lowland paca, white-tailed deer, anteater (Tamandua tetradactyla) and buzzard (Sarcoramphus papa). The most abundant species include the bat Artibeus jamaicensis and the rat Peromyscus mexicanus.|$|E
2500|$|Veracruz {{has been}} {{described}} as having one of the richest varieties of wildlife in the western hemisphere. There is an especially diverse array of endemic insects like the conspicuous Arsenura armida. As well as insects, the state is known for its many arachnids, and features over 25 species of tarantula (Theraphosidae), of which many are endemic. The state is part of Birdlife International’s Endemic Bird Area(EBA) project due to the number of endemic birds here. Some of these include green-cheeked amazon (Amazona viridigenalis), Tamaulipas crow (Corvus imparatus), Altamira yellowthroat (Geothlypis flavovelata) and crimson-collared grosbeak (Rhodothraupis celaeno). Despite much of the deterioration of the forest areas, it is still an important stopover for migratory birds as well. Many endangered mammal species can be found here including two endemic rodents (Peromyscus ochraventer, Neotoma angustapalata), the jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), <b>jaguarundi</b> (Herpailurus yaguarondi) and coati (Nasua narica) [...] The endangered Baird's tapir may occasionally be spotted in the state's southern jungle regions, such as Biósfera Los Tuxtlas. This region is also the northernmost extent of the primate Alouatta palliata, or mantled howler.|$|E

50|$|The <b>jaguarundi</b> {{is closely}} related to the cougar, even though it’s only 10% its size; this is proven by its similar genetic {{structure}} and chromosome count. Both species are genetically closer to the larger felids; their chromosome numbers are 38, similar to the jaguar’s, while smaller felids have 26 chromosomes. The <b>jaguarundi</b> and cougar are classified as part of the Puma genus but the <b>jaguarundi</b> is sometimes classified under Herpailurus, a different genus. According to a study of Felidae, an ancestor of the puma genus, lineages of these species migrated across the Bering land bridge into the Americas about 8 to 8 and a half million years ago, and that is how current populations of jaguarundis and cougars in the Americas came to be.|$|E
50|$|The <b>jaguarundi</b> {{has also}} been sighted around the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, and as south as Cerro Largo, Uruguay.|$|E
50|$|The Gulf Coast <b>jaguarundi</b> (Puma yagouaroundi cacomitli) is a {{subspecies}} of <b>jaguarundi</b> {{that ranges}} from southern Texas in the United States south to Veracruz and San Luis Potosí in eastern Mexico. This cat looks like a large weasel or otter with a coat {{in one of three}} color phases: black, reddish-brown or brownish-gray. Darker varieties tend to be found in darker places, like forests, than those who are lighter in hue, which prefer more open areas.|$|E
50|$|The two color phases {{were once}} thought to {{represent}} two distinct species: the grey one called <b>jaguarundi,</b> and the red one called eyra.|$|E

50|$|As {{categorized}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the Gulf Coast <b>jaguarundi</b> is currently endangered, so conservation efforts are being {{implemented by the}} Fish and Wildlife Service. As a federal governmental agency within the U.S. Department of the Interior dedicated to the management of fish, wildlife, and natural habitats, the agency has proposed steps to take to reestablish <b>jaguarundi</b> populations, but has so far failed to fulfill many of them. Some of these steps include assessing habitat and land connectivity to support viable populations, developing survey techniques to ascertain their status and better understand their ecological and conservation needs, and developing partnerships to help promote <b>jaguarundi</b> conservation. The biggest threat to the Gulf Coast jaguarundis is the Mexico-U.S. border fence, as it fragments populations and prevents migration. Additionally, jaguarundis are facing habitat loss, so the Fish and Wildlife Service is planting shrubs and plants found in a jaguarundi’s natural environment in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.|$|E
