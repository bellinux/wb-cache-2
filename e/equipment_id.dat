50|$|In 1977, a Brazilian inventor, Valdir Bravo Salinas, filed {{a patent}} {{application}} for a caller ID device at the Brazilian Patent and Trademarks Office (INPI). The patent was issued in 1982 as patent PI7704466 and is the first patent ever issued for a caller <b>ID</b> <b>equipment</b> in Brazil. Later in 1980 two other Brazilian inventors, João da Cunha Doya and Nélio José Nicolai, filed different patent applications for caller ID devices. Mr. Doya’s application was filed on May, 2nd, 1980 and issued as patent PI8003077. Mr. Nicolai’s application was filed on July, 2nd,1980 and rejected for being a mere copy of Mr. Salinas’ invention, thus lacking novelty. In 1981 another {{application for a}} caller <b>ID</b> <b>equipment</b> was filed at the INPI. The inventors were Mr. José Daniel Martin Catoira and Mr. Afonso Feijó da Costa Ribeiro Neto. This application was granted and the patent was issued as patent PI8106464.|$|R
5|$|Claiming that {{corporations}} and government {{are planning to}} track every move of consumers and citizens with RFID as the latest step toward a 1984-like surveillance state, consumer privacy advocates, such as Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre, have become Christian conspiracy theorists who believe spychips must be resisted because they argue that modern database and communications technologies, coupled with point of sale data-capture <b>equipment</b> and sophisticated <b>ID</b> and authentication systems, now {{make it possible to}} require a biometrically associated number or mark to make purchases. They fear that the ability to implement such a system closely resembles the Number of the Beast prophesied in the Book of Revelation.|$|R
5000|$|Unique Identification Marking, UID marking, Item Unique Identification or IUID, {{is a part}} of the {{compliance}} process mandated by the United States Department of Defense. It is a permanent marking method used to give <b>equipment</b> a unique <b>ID.</b> Marking is essential for all equipment with an acquisition cost of over $5,000, equipment which is mission essential, controlled inventory, or serially-controlled. UID-marking is a set of data for assets that is globally unique and unambiguous. The technology used to mark an item is 2D Data Matrix ECC 200 Symbol. UID marking can be used to ensure data integrity and data quality throughout an item's lifecycle; it also supports multi-faceted business applications.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{the concept and}} initial {{prototype}} of a device {{that can be used}} to support evidence recovery at a crime scene. The key elements are radio frequency identification (RFID) tags that are fitted to evidence bags, which provide an association between the bag’s content and an evidence log. The log contains such details as a description of the objects (provided through speech), images of the scene or the objects (captured through digital cameras), the time of recovery, the location of recovery (captured through either global positioning system or through ultrasonic positioning <b>equipment)</b> and the <b>ID</b> of the person who recovered the object. Subsequent analysis can also be linked to the RFID tag...|$|R
50|$|As a compromise, the CNE {{set aside}} {{five days in}} May 2004 to allow the owners of disputed {{signatures}} to confirm that they did, in fact, back the referendum call: this {{was known as the}} reparo process. At the end of that verification effort, the total number of signatures stood at 2,436,830, according to the CNE. Thus, the target had been reached and the referendum could take place. During that time, thousands of forged <b>ID</b> cards and <b>equipment</b> to create forged ID cards were confiscated by the police. Supporters of Chávez believed that the opposition used these to forge signatures. The opposition claimed that the <b>equipment</b> and the <b>ID</b> cards were planted.|$|R
2500|$|Several {{websites}} {{identify the}} beast as referring to an indistinct modern-day cartel of banking organizations, {{sometimes referred to}} as the [...] "New World Order". The theory extends to the digitization of money and the possible use of RFID chips in humans as being the mark of the beast without which none may buy or sell. [...] An example of this is consumer privacy advocates, Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre, who believe spychips must be resisted because they argue that modern database and communications technologies, coupled with point of sale data-capture <b>equipment</b> and sophisticated <b>ID</b> and authentication systems, now make it possible to require a biometrically associated number or mark to make purchases.

50|$|In general, CID as {{transmitted}} from {{the origin of}} the call is only the calling party's full phone number (including area code, and including international access code and country code if it's an international call). The calling party name is added by the consumer's terminating central office if the consumer has subscribed to that service. Calling name delivery is not automatic. A SS7 (or Signalling System 7) TCAP query may be launched by the called party's central office, in order to retrieve the information for Calling Name delivery to the caller <b>ID</b> <b>equipment</b> at the consumer's location, if the caller's name has not already been associated with the calling party's line at the originating central office. Canadian systems using CCS7 automatically (but not in all cases) send the calling name with the call set-up and routing information {{at the time of the}} call.|$|R
5000|$|Where {{blocking}} {{is applied}} on a call-by-call basis (that is, {{at the time}} a call is made), subscribers can block their caller ID by dialing a special code (a vertical service code, or VSC) before making a call. In North America and some other regions, the code is *67, while in the United Kingdom and Ireland, it is 141. This special code does not block the information from companies using call capture technology. This means that <b>equipment</b> with caller <b>ID</b> will simply display the word [...] "PRIVATE" [...] or [...] "WITHHELD". When CNID is blocked at the caller's request, the number is actually transmitted through the entire telephone network, with the [...] "presentation withheld" [...] flag set; the destination CO is expected to honor this flag, but sometimes does not—especially when the destination phone number is served by an ISDN PRI.|$|R
50|$|The {{assault in}} earnest on the SF Sarre, Operation Tiger, opened on 14 June with an {{artillery}} bombardment that {{had little effect}} on French defenses. Nevertheless, the German offensive arrayed the German First Army (AOK 1), which deployed the XII (XII AK, 75th and 268th IDs), XXIV (XXIV AK, 60th and 252nd IDs) and XXX (XXX AK, 79th, 93rd and 258th IDs) Corps, backed by a reserve composed of the 168th, 197th, 198th and 257th IDs against the French 20th Corps. The 20th Corps was composed of five regiments of fortress infantry supported by the 52nd ID and the 1st Polish Grenadiers. German air support was provided by V Fliegerkorps. The principal attack started at 0730, with XII AK and XXX AK moving against {{the west side of the}} Sarre valley, XXIV moving to the east in support. The German attack focused on the Valette village. The attack met with mixed success, taking casualties from unsuppressed French artillery, but capturing several French blockhouses. The 93rd ID's attack stalled, however, taking fire from the main line of fortifications, forcing a withdrawal. An attempted crossing of the Nied by the 258th ID failed as well. Fire from a French 75mm casemate destroyed German artillery and bridging <b>equipment.</b> The 268th <b>ID's</b> attack initially stalled, but broke through French lines at Hoste. The 75th ID's attack across the Moderbach also produced success after an initial setback. XXIV AK's attack on the east side of the sector failed entirely and was the object of a successful French counterattack.|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} is analyzing accountability of public service in managementIdentity Card at tatanga District Office and the obstructed factors. The method used in this study is qualitative research, to describe the phenomena based on the fact in the research focus. The population {{of this study is}} the stake holders of Tatanga District and the public service users. Sample selection used purposive technique by selecting 6 (six) informants. Technique of data collection in this study consisted of observation, interview and document. The result of the study showed that the accountability of public service in management Identity Card at the offfice of Tatanga District was less maximal. This was proved by 3 (three) indicators considered to be a starting point, they are service reference, attention to the public and solution. Only 1 (one) indicator showed the accountability of service is the solution. It was given by the goverment of the Tatanga District for the public service users had been maximally implemented. While indicator of service reference and attention to the public had not got maximal categories yet. The factors that obstructed the accountability of public service in management Identity Card at Tatanga District offfice which is found in this study were unavailability of <b>equipment</b> to create <b>ID</b> card. Thus, the duty of the District government officials in service only confined to ID card. Then the people have to complete it to another district office or Civil Registration in Palu. Besides, the service provided from district government in management Identity Card still oriented on arrangement or simply impressed very normative, less committed to adjust servicing values or norms that exist in society {{in order to create a}} quality of service that is oriented on customer satisfaction...|$|R
