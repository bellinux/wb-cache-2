40|$|Since {{injection}} falloff fracture {{calibration test}} is generally {{accepted as a}} reliable way to obtain several key formation parameters, {{it is one of}} the essential parts of hydraulic fracturing design. While several abnormal behaviors have been described qualitatively and are frequently observed in an injection falloff fracture calibration test, the only quantitative model for before-closure behavior accounts only for normal leakoff which usually seldom happens in practice. This paper describes several new analytical and semi-analytical models to simulate and quantify abnormal leakoff behaviors such as tip <b>extension,</b> <b>pressure</b> dependent leakoff (PDL), multiple apparent closures and transverse storage. Based on material balance, we model pressure change with time considering the fracture geometry and leakoff volume under various leakoff mechanisms. Then, we show that the appearance of the modeled mechanisms both on the standard Nolte plot and on the log-log diagnostic Bourdet derivative presentation qualitatively matches behavior seen in previously published field data examples. Results suggest that the early ?-slope occasionally observed on the log-log diagnostic plot is probably fracture linear flow. When present it can mask all or part of a wellbore storage effect. Natural fractures have a significant impact on the pressure falloff behavior when they are opened during treatment. Depending on the properties of the natural fracture system, the pressure response can behave as pressure-dependent leakoff (PDL), transverse storage, multiple closures or even normal leakoff in some cases. In addition, if tip extension or PDL behavior are observed, propagation pressure or natural fissures opening pressure can be estimated respectively. The flow regime models are combined to provide a global model for the closure behavior. When shown on the log-log diagnostic plot, the various model features can be identified and used to estimate parameters to which each model is sensitive. Sensitivity analyses with the new model show relative importance with time of the various model features. This work promotes a complete understanding of the pressure response from various leakoff physics and provides a method to quantify parameters needed for more effective hydraulic fracture design...|$|R

50|$|At large <b>extensions,</b> the <b>pressure</b> {{inside a}} natural rubber balloon once again goes up. This {{is due to}} a number of {{physical}} effects that were ignored in the James/Guth theory: crystallization, imperfect flexibility of the molecular chains, steric hindrances and the like. As a result, if the two balloons are initially very extended, other outcomes of the two-balloon experiment are possible, and this makes the behavior of rubber balloons more complex than, say, interconnected soap bubbles. In addition, natural rubber exhibits hysteresis: the pressure depends not just on the balloon diameter, but also on the manner in which inflation took place and on the initial direction of change. For instance, the pressure during inflation is always greater than the pressure during subsequent deflation at a given radius. One consequence is that equilibrium will generally be obtained with a lesser change in diameter than would have occurred in the ideal case. The system has been modeled by a number of authors, for example to produce phase diagrams specifying under what conditions the small balloon can inflate the larger, or the other way round.|$|R
