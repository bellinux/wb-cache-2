Fine metal {{particles are}} placed into a <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> and then high gas or fluid pressure {{is applied to}} the mould. The resulting article is then sintered in a furnace which increases the strength of the part by bonding the metal particles. This manufacturing process produces very little scrap metal and {{can be used to make}} many different shapes. The tolerances that this process can achieve are very precise, ranging from +/- 0.008 inches (0.2 mm) for axial dimensions and +/- 0.020 inches (0.5 mm) for radial dimensions. This is the most efficient type of powder compacting (the following subcategories are also from this reference). [...] This operation is generally applicable on small production quantities, as it is more costly to run due to its slow operating speed and the need for expendable tooling.|$|E
40|$|Free-form {{buildings}} {{tend to be}} expensive. By optimizing {{the production}} process, economical and wellperforming concrete structures and elements can be manufactured. In this paper, an innovative method is presented that allows producing highly accurate double curved-elements {{without the need for}} milling two expensive mould surfaces per single element. The <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> is fully reusable and the benefits of applying self-compacting concrete are utilised. The <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> process work as follows: Thin concrete panels are cast in a horizontally positioned <b>flexible</b> <b>mould,</b> using a self-levelling concrete. After a certain initial hardening, the mould is deformed and the concrete is allowed to harden further. The knowledge about rheological characteristics is essential during casting and to find the suitable moment for the mould to be deformed. The behaviour of the concrete in the plastic stage is important: A) to allow the concrete to follow the deformation of the <b>flexible</b> <b>mould,</b> B) to counteract its movement under a slope and C) to prevent cracking in an early phase. After the <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> has reached its final position, the concrete develops its strength and can be demoulded in a short production-cycle; aesthetically attractive elements of different and complex geometries can be produced with the same reusable mould. The <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> process was studied with an experimental program on the influence of the mould material, shaping mechanism, element thickness, mix design and rheological characteristics. High strength self-compacting concrete was applied with different aggregate sizes for the production of the elements. In initial experiments, no reinforcement was added in the panels. In later tests, elements were reinforced with textiles that were able to follow the deformation of the mould. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

As the design freedom of such panels {{is limited to}} the arrangement density of pins, more compactly arranged pins come to mind.

To manufacture panels with filigree geometries while using lower pin arrangement densities, attaching rapid tooling moulds is useful.

40|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of the freeform shapes it is often not possible to distinguish any repetitive elements in freeform buildings at all.

40|$|The cost {{associated}} with producing concrete elements {{has a direct}} link to its geometry. Further cost is incurred if panels have variable thicknesses throughout their cross-section. These variations can {{take the form of}} edge-returns in cladding elements (required for detailing), stiffening ribs (required for structure) or simply surface textures (required for architectural expression). In the context of free-form concrete geometries, fabrication of such features becomes even more difficult. Current moulding systems for such elements are in no means cost-effective as individual moulds are still required for every unique panel. What is required is a more flexible approach to the fabrication of complex free-form geometries: a hybrid system of already-existing techniques.

40|$|A new {{architectural}} concept {{is being developed}} nowadays - free-form design, which allows the architects to add personality to a building through the shape itself. To sustain this development, the existing and available production techniques have to be combined with new technological innovations. The <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> system uses the traditional technologies for pre-cast concrete fabrication to realize curved concrete elements. The <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> system relies on deformation of the concrete panels at very early age, when the tensile strength of the material has just started to develop and has not reached high values yet. Due to this physical deformation and the forced strains thus created in the material, a crack pattern can be formed {{on the surface of}} the element. The current research provides a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the cracks formed due to physical deformation. A range of influencing parameters were considered in the research: deformation time, radius of deformation, thickness of the elements and water/cement ratios. Also two alternative materials were analyzed and evaluated as potential replacements for the traditional concrete mixture. The results of the current research showed that fabrication of double-curved elements by using a <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> system can be realized without affecting considerably the concrete’s microscopic structure. A list of recommendations is provided as a result of the current thesis for the parties which in the future will be potentially involved in designing and manufacturing double-curved concrete elements. The double-curved concrete elements promise to bring a significant amount of flexibility in the next generation of architectural entities.

40|$|The {{production}} of precast, concrete elements with complex, double-curved geometry is expensive {{due to the}} high costcosts of the necessary moulds and the limited possibilities for mould reuse. Currently, CNC-milled foam moulds are the solution applied mostly in projects, offering good aesthetic performance, but also resulting in waste of material, relatively low production speed and fairly high costs per element. The <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> method aims to offer an economic alternative for this state of art technology by allowing repeated reuse of the same mould, and if necessary, reuse in adapted shape. A patent and literature review and comparison of state-of-art formwork methods reveals that, {{although the idea of}} a flexible formwork already dates from the mid- 20 th century, in building industry it has not yet found widespread application, and is still experimental to a large extent. In other industries, such as aerospace and automotive, flexible moulds are occasionally used for rapid prototyping purposes, mostly for the forming of thin metal sheets. The understanding of the <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> principle in terms of mechanics is still in development. In combination with concrete, the <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> has been industrially applied only on occasion. Deliberately imposed deformation of concrete after casting allows the use of only one single-sided <b>flexible</b> <b>mould,</b> but - being a method quite alien to normal precast concrete production - has hardly been investigated. Therefore, models are needed both for the flexible layer as well as it's use in combination with concrete. By analysing a number of architectural cases in terms of geometrical aspects, more information is gathered about building size, element thickness, curvature radius and number and type of elements. This information is used to define the type of shapes for which the <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> method would be suitable. Through the last 80 years, the shape of curved architecture has changed; whereas the early famous shell designers such as Isler and Torroja aimed for structurally optimized and material-efficient shapes, nowadays these shapes have mostly made place for free-form curves, in which parametric design or sculptural influences are leading. For larger projects, several hundreds to even thousands of uniquely curved elements are manufactured, varying in curvature radius in a range between 0. 75 m and 45 m. Furthermore the contours and edge position can vary from element to element. Prediction of each element's edge position is non-trivial for the <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> method, especially not for elements with strong curvature. The deformation process can be described mathematically by analysing thecurvature parameters. An important and meaningful parameter is the Gaussian curvature. Depending on the change in Gaussian curvature, the imposed deformation of the mould surface and the concrete results in certain amounts of bending action (B) and in-plane surface stretching (S). Bending tensile strains in the still plastic concrete can be in the range of 25 to 50  for an element with 50 mm thickness, which is far more than the values normally encountered in concrete after casting. The application of in-plane shear deformation appears to be helpful to deform the mould from flat to double-curved. The exact positioning of the element edges can be determined from this in-plane shear deformation. The shape of the mould, in the present research, is controlled by a grid of actuators - extendible support points that follow the intended architectural shape. As mould surface, a thin rubber layer can be used, that, however, has to be supported by a material that is capable of carrying the weight of the concrete without visible deflection between the actuators. Various solutions are investigated for this support material, of which the strip mould offers the most accurate results and predictability. As said, the concrete in this method is deliberately deformed after casting in an open, single-sided mould. This requires control over both the fluidity and strain capacity of the fresh concrete: if the concrete is too fluid, it will flow out of the mould after deformation due to the slope of the mould, if it is already too stiff, cracks may occur. Various experiments are conducted to investigate the viability of the principle as well as the parameters that influence the risk of either flow or cracking. It appears that the use of a self-compacting concrete with thixotropic properties reduces both the risks: as a result of quick stabilisation after casting, the yield strength build-up will prevent flow once the mould is deformed and put at a certain slope. Thanks to it's plastic strain capacity, this type of concrete will be able to undergo the imposed deformation without cracking. An important measure to prevent this cracking is the curing of the concrete directly after casting and a deformation that takes place before initial setting time. Thin steel rebar, glass-fibre textiles or mixed fibres are all applicable as reinforcement, the latter two giving the best results. For the measurement of yield strength development of the concrete mixture before and after casting, various methods are investigated. Literature research and experiments demonstrate that, once the rheological behaviour of a mixture has been determined with a viscometer accompanied with slump (flow) tests, the correct moment of deformation of the <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> can later be determined from repeated slump (flow) tests with sufficient reliability. However, as soon as the mixture constituents will be adapted, new viscometer measurements have to be carried out again. The <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> method has been successfully tested on single- and double-curved precast concrete elements with a radius down to 1. 50 m and an element thickness up to 50 mm. Until this moment, the maximum element size tested was approximately 2 x 1 m 2, but larger elements are expected to be feasible. An integrated design-to-production process is required: due to the complex geometry and the impact of this geometry on all aspects of the manufacturing, all parties involved should cooperate to make the use of this method possible. Computational skills are needed to determine design parameters and control the manufacturing process. Several new questions were identified during the research, but at this moment, implementation of the <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> method in an industrial environment in cooperation with a concrete product manufacturer {{is the best way to}} determine the priorities for further research.

40|$|The {{construction}} of buildings with fi-ee-form surfaces can be accompanied with relatively high costs. An innovative method to produce free-form surfaces in concrete is the application of double-curved precast panels produced with a <b>flexible</b> re-usable <b>mould</b> technique. Traditional placing of reinforcing bars to strengthen such panels causes practical problems, since only thin rebars are able to follow {{the movement of the}} mould during the production process. The use of flexible textile reinforcement can overcome such production limitations and effectively strengthens the panels. This paper discusses results of an experimental study on the behaviour of glass fibre textiles in concrete produced with a <b>flexible</b> re-usable <b>mould.</b> The movement of the mould during production might affect the position o f the textiles and thus the flexural capacity of the panels. The accuracy of the production method related to the position of the textiles was determined by measurements and indicated that the textiles were able to follow the deformation o f the mould. The friction of fibres inside a bundle not directly bonded with the mortar assured ductility of the panels. The proposed method to reinforce the panels proved feasible and a pronounced strain-hardening behaviour was obtained due to the action of the textiles.

Drawing on well-established definitions of different innovation types I present the concept of step-change innovation, which I define as: The practical implementation of an idea, outside the current technological trajectory, leading to changes of the concepts in a production process, and relate it to process innovation initiatives. I raise the following research questions: 	RQ 1 : How are step-change innovation projects initiated in the process industry? Hereunder, what are the key issues or elements and how are they managed? 	RQ 2 : How are step-change innovation projects implemented in the process industry? Hereunder, what are the key issues or elements and how are they managed? Based on key lessons learned from three case studies within Hydro, I say something about what is best practice for managing step-change innovation in the process industry. Altogether 28 informants were interviewed, and although there are limitations to this study, I find the empirical evidence grounding the findings to be strong. The first step-change innovation project concerns the implementation of a new process technology in the wire rod cast house at Hydro s plant in Karmøy.

It was identified a pattern of new problems emerging when realigning the new technology with the existing machinery.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of double-curved {{precast concrete}} elements is still expensive, {{due to the}} high costs and limited possibilities for repetitive use of the moulds or formwork. The goal of the research described in {{this paper is to}} develop a production method that overcomes these difficulties by enabling the mould to be reused many times and by making the shape of the mould adjustable in a flexible way. First the paper gives an introduction of free-form architecture and the issues related to realizing complex geometry in concrete. Sequentially, the paper reports on the structural mechanics models that have been developed to accurately describe the behaviour of a <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> material. Finally laboratory experiments are reported, that are based on the concept of deforming an initially flat concrete element into a curved shape after a short initial hardening period. After this deformation process further hardening will take place in the final curved shape. The advantages of starting with an initial flat layer are that no contra-mould is needed, the element thickness can be controlled accurately and the casting process is relatively quick and simple.

40|$|Polyimides have {{attractive}} thermal, {{mechanical and}} electrical properties, and have found applications in fields ranging from spacecraft to microelectronics and optoelectronics. Patterning polyimide at nanoscale {{would open the}} window for many new applications. In this work, we developed three approaches to pattern polyimide using nanoimprint lithography (NIL) : imprint at its uncured soft state and cure it afterwards; imprint another low Tg polymer, then transfer the pattern into polyimide by RIE; and direct imprint into polyimide at temperature higher than its Tg. Polyimide gratings with 200 nm period and 110 nm line-width were successfully fabricated by all the three approaches. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages. The first method is relatively simple and fast, but some residual solvent and water may cause outgassing when subjected to temperature well above 200 C for prolonged time. The second approach is more complicated, while the third approach needs very high temperature. Two applications of the nanostructured polyimide are demonstrated: as a <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> to structure PMMA by NIL and as a template for chemical sensor based on surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Both applications {{have taken advantage of}} polyimide 2 ̆ 019 s high temperature stability and excellent mechanical properties, and cannot be realized by other common thermoplastic polymers. We believe that NIL is an efficient technique to pattern polyimide with high throughput and low cost. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|This {{text and}} the body of artwork it {{describes}} are the outcomes of a practice-based research project exploring the question: "What are the implications and opportunities of transferring the improvisational potential of drawing to a contemporary sculptural practice, using Diana Cooper and Hew Locke's practices (2000 - 2004) as precedents?"- This is the final form of the question, which evolved over time {{in response to the}} findings of this research. The original question was: "Is it possible to create a sculptural practice that is, or could be conceived as, drawing in three-dimensions?" which was inspired by the desire to improve my sculptural practice, with transferred qualities of drawing. The thesis also discusses the approach to the research, and the methods utilized. It includes a discussion that focuses on practice-based methodologies, with the specific approach of art as research, or research for art and design. (Frayling, C 1998). This approach involves the performative perspective, (Borgdorff, H. 2006), whilst utilizing Schön's reflection in and on action. (Schön, D 1983). Using this type of process produced a journey of knowledge production, which was based on an experimental cycle of practice-based learning. The experimental cycle produced the conditions for a direct engagement with the creative process, whilst utilizing tacit knowledge, to improve my practice. This improvement was informed, through the questions this process raised, whilst utilizing the evaluative technique of interpretation and performative analysis. These techniques allowed for the development of my practice within the studio environment, which was important due to the need for it to work within this environment. This thesis also details the journey undertaken during the research, and its conclusions. The investigation explores the work of contemporary artists who explore the boundaries between sculpture and drawing. The research identified the artists Diana Cooper and Hew Locke, whose practices are {{at the forefront of the}} expansion of contemporary drawing into the three-dimensional realm. Through a critical review of Hew Locke and Diana Cooper's practices i was able to identify a number of creative strategies, which could improve my practice. These strategies were addition and mutation, which produces the potential for improvisation, whilst removing the restraints associated with pre-determined forms. Removing these restraints gave my practice the opportunity to evolve through an improvisational approach, which utilizes a <b>flexible,</b> adaptive <b>moulding</b> technique. This practice, and the sculptures it produces, are the embodiment of the findings of the research. These sculptures were presented, at the end of the research, in an exhibition at De Montfort University...|$|R
40|$|Early-age {{shrinkage}} {{and cracking}} have become reoccurring problem in concrete construction. Conditions such as reduced maximum aggregate size, increased amount of fines, presence of retarding admixtures, increased binder content and deficient covering and curing {{all contribute to}} this problem. At early age, when the cement paste is young and has poorly developed mechanical properties, autogenous and evaporating shrinkage, both incorporated in the plastic shrinkage, are the two main driving forces for cracking. For modern concretes developing large autogenous shrinkage, as the high performance and self-compacting concrete (SCC), early-age cracking is a highly topical and important area. When the concrete dries out due to evaporation there will be formation of water menisci near the concrete surface. The distance between the particles then tends to be reduced and the concrete will contract. These contracting capillary forces are in reverse ratio to the meniscus radius. The capillary tension stresses will therefore increase with decreasing interparticle spaces. For a concrete where the evaporation is prevented, the negative capillary pressure will also start to develop as the concrete sets. As a solid skeleton starts to form the chemical shrinkage is not totally transformed into external volume change and, if the water supply is restricted, empty pores will be formed inside the paste and water meniscus occurs. In this work, early age (< 24 h) autogenous deformation and crack tendency due to plastic shrinkage was measured. For the autogenous deformation, a specially developed digital dilatometer was used with great satisfactory, generating accurately measures of the linear displacements of the concrete cast in a vapor proof <b>flexible</b> tube <b>mould.</b> The plastic shrinkage cracking tendency was evaluated, using a modified Nordtest method (NT BUILD 433), where the concrete sample was exposed to early drying conditions and where the restraining inner steel ring causes development of tangential stresses which if sufficiently high leads to cracking. As the underlying mechanisms are not quantified by the ring-test and as plastic shrinkage strongly {{are related to the}} negative capillary pressure in fresh concrete, the test was complimented with transducer recording the development of the pore pressure. In some cases, pore pressure development was also measured on sealed specimens, referring to the autogenous deformation tests. A large number of different SCC constituents and mix compositions have been investigated; e. g. w/c-ratio from 0. 38 to 0. 67, coarse aggregate content, silica fume, fly ash, cement type, extra water and different admixtures (accelerator, retarder, shrinkage reducer, air entraining agent, superplasticizer dosage). For comparison, tests with standard concrete were made. The crack tendency test was also performed on mixes with different fibers and curing compounds. The influence of different constituents and mixes on the autogenous deformation and plastic shrinkage crack tendency was significantly observed. The results indicated that: • High crack tendency was generated when: - large autogenous shrinkage (silica addition, low w/c, high fineness) - high water evaporation (extra water, high w/c, low fineness) - retardation (retarder, slow hardening cement, high superplastisizer dosage), - low content of coarse aggregate • Minimum crack tendency at w/c 0. 55 IV • Reduced crack tendency by: - shrinkage reducing admixture (large positive effect on both autogenous shrinkage and evaporation, without influencing the time to initial- and final set) - acceleration (accelerator, rapid cement) - air entraining agent - fibers - wax membrane (effectively for concretes with high evaporation) Finally the ring-test method and the experimental results were clearly verified by field studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLaminating carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) {{traditionally}} uses rigid moulds. This {{process means}} that customising CFRP components is expensive since {{the costs of}} each rigid mould are allocated fully to only one associated CFRP. Therefore, using form-flexible moulds is beneficial, because it would eliminate the conventional restriction that each CFRP geometry needs one single rigid mould. The costs of one <b>flexible</b> <b>mould</b> would be allocated to all produced CFRP components. Thus, the more CFRP laminated on this single form-flexible mould, the less the CFRP is affected by mould costs. Creating form-flexible moulds by using pin-type tooling results in a discrete pin accumulation. To achieve the required continuous laminating surface, an interpolation layer {{is placed on the}} pins. However, compared to conventional CFRP moulds, normally made by CNC-milling, pin-type tooling complicates accuracy achievement. This {{is due to the fact}} that the elastic, silicone-like interpolation layer as well as several tolerances or inaccuracies within the mould mechanics, as an assembly, accumulate into the range of millimeters. Instead of using more accurate pin-type moulds, which is associated with increasing costs, this paper introduces an approach to integrate 3 D surface detection methods into the process of form-flexible moulding of spatially curved CFRP using pin-type tools, which maintains costs and increases accuracy. The developed control loop compensates deviations dynamically and results in accuracies in the same range as parts produced using CNC-milled rigid moulds...|$|E
