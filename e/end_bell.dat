25|$|The {{process of}} making the large open <b>end</b> (<b>bell)</b> of a brass {{instrument}} is called metal beating. In making the bell of, for example, a trumpet, a person lays out a pattern and shapes sheet metal into a bell-shape using templates, machine tools, handtools, and blueprints. The maker cuts out the bell blank, using hand or power shears. He hammers the blank over a bell-shaped mandrel, and butts the seam, using a notching tool. The seam is brazed, using a torch and smoothed using a hammer or file. A draw bench or arbor press equipped with expandable lead plug is used to shape and smooth the bell and bell neck over a mandrel. A lathe is used to spin the bell head and to form a bead {{at the edge of}} bell head. Previously shaped bell necks are annealed, using a hand torch to soften the metal for further bending. Scratches are removed from the bell using abrasive-coated cloth.|$|E
2500|$|His {{impressive}} KO wins then {{earned him}} a chance to compete in a superfight at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2009 in Seoul Final 16 on September 26, where he faced Japanese karate fighter Taiei Kin in a highly-controversial bout. Towards {{the end of the first}} round, the [...] "clapper" [...] (the device used to signal the remaining 10 seconds of the round) sounded. Moroşanu seemed to think the sound indicative of the ending of the round, and began walking towards his corner, only to be met by a punch from Kin (who was rightfully continuing in the context of the official rules regarding the fight). The <b>end</b> <b>bell,</b> signifying the officially sanctioned end of the round, sounded moments later. [...] Moroşanu deliberately continued to fight, hitting Taiei (who was defenseless after dropping his hands at the end of the round) with a two punch flurry, knocking him unconscious. Moroşanu was disqualified from the fight, thus giving the victory to Taiei by means of disqualification.|$|E

2500|$|Also, using certain fingerings, notes may be {{produced}} {{on the instrument}} that sound lower pitches than the actual range of the instrument. These [...] "impossible notes" [...] tend to sound very gravelly and out of tune, but technically sound below the low B. Alternatively, lower notes can {{be produced}} by inserting a small paper or rubber tube into {{the end of the}} bell, which converts the lower B into a lower note such as an A natural; this lowers the pitch of the instrument, but has the positive effect of bringing the lowest register (which is typically quite sharp) into tune. A notable piece that calls for the use of a low A bell is Carl Nielsen's Wind Quintet, op. 43, which includes an optional low A for the final cadence of the work. Bassoonists sometimes use the <b>end</b> <b>bell</b> segment of an English horn or clarinet if one is available instead of a specially made extension. This often yields unsatisfactory results, though, as the resultant A can be quite sharp. The idea of using low A was begun by Richard Wagner, who wanted to extend the range of the bassoon. Many passages in his later operas require the low A as well as the B-flat above. (This is impossible on a normal bassoon using an A extension as the fingering for the B-flat yields the low A.) These passages are typically realized on the contrabassoon, as recommended by the composer. Some bassoons have been made to allow bassoonists to realize similar passages. These bassoons are made with a [...] "Wagner bell" [...] which is an extended bell with a key for both the low A and the low B-flat. Bassoons with Wagner bells suffer similar intonational deficiencies as a bassoon with an A extension. Another composer who has required the bassoon to be chromatic down to low A is Gustav Mahler. Richard Strauss also calls for the low A in his opera Intermezzo.|$|E

5|$|By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters {{had been}} {{drafted into the}} United States Armed Forces for World War II.

50|$|Farnham is a {{small village}} in Essex, England, {{situated}} near Bishop's Stortford. The main features are Farnham Church of England Primary School, {{the church and the}} Three Horseshoes pub in Hazel End, which some consider a hamlet in its own right. The population is approximately 300, increasing to 410 at the 2011 census. It is divided up into several areas, such as Farnham, Hazel <b>End,</b> <b>Bell's</b> Cottages, Saven <b>End</b> and Farnham Green.The name is derived from the Fernham (Hamlet in the ferns).|$|R

5000|$|Until the 19th century Kempston was a mainly rural parish. It {{was one of}} {{the largest}} in Bedfordshire with an area of 5,025 acres (20 km²) at the time of {{enclosure}} in 1804, and was in Redbournestoke Hundred. Historically there was no central village, but instead settlement was divided between a number of hamlets called [...] "Ends", for example, Up <b>End,</b> <b>Bell</b> End, Wood End and Box End. Kempston's parish church, All Saints, was in Church End, which was not the largest end but is fairly central. In the 19th century East <b>End,</b> <b>Bell</b> End and Up End began to coalesce into a larger settlement. In 1870 developers began to attempt to develop land on the road from Kempston to Bedford under the name [...] "Kempston New Town". Construction was slow at first, but the new district soon began to expand steadily and Kempston acquired a more urban feel. A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Kempston Barracks in 1876.|$|E

50|$|Common argon and krypton lasers {{are capable}} of {{emitting}} continuous-wave (CW) output of several milliwatts to tens of watts. Their tubes are usually made from nickel <b>end</b> <b>bells,</b> kovar metal-to-ceramic seals, beryllium oxide ceramics, or tungsten disks mounted on a copper heat spreader in a ceramic liner. The earliest tubes were simple quartz, followed by quartz with graphite disks. In comparison with the helium-neon lasers that require just a few milliamperes, the current used for pumping the krypton laser is several amperes, as the gas has to be ionized. The ion laser tube produces a lot of waste heat and requires active cooling.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, the Army reopened the LOH {{competition}} for bids and Bell resubmitted {{for the program}} using their model 206A design. Fairchild-Hiller failed to resubmit their bid with the YOH-5A, which they had successfully marketed as the FH-1100. In the <b>end,</b> <b>Bell</b> won the contract and the model 206A was designated as the OH-58A. Following the Army's naming convention for its aircraft, the OH-58A was named Kiowa for the Native American tribe.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, Egyptologists such as Barbara Bell {{believe that}} an {{economic}} catastrophe such as a famine or a long-lasting drought affected Egypt at that time.

5000|$|In the <b>end,</b> <b>Bell,</b> who had {{coached the}} Eagles to five {{straight}} losing seasons, named himself {{head coach of}} the team. This move was made in part because the owners were hesitant to offer a binding contract to a coach due to the specter of the country possibly entering the war. Kiesling, who had led the Steelers the previous season, was retained as Bell's assistant. The Steelers began the [...] season with two straight losses, after which Rooney tried to convince Bell to step down as coach. Bell agreed to do so only if Rooney could convince Buff Donelli to take over the reins.|$|E
