To determine one possible mechanism for this we compared the effects of auranofin and myochrysine on intestinal water and solute transport in the rat. Jejunal perfusion with 2 mM auranofin (n = 5) <b>induced</b> <b>fluid</b> and electrolyte secretion and inhibited glucose absorption (p less than 0. 01). Auranofin (0. 2 mM) <b>induced</b> <b>fluid</b> secretion in the jejunum (n = 5; p less than 0. 01) and colon (n = 6; p less than 0. 01).

40|$|Naturally {{fractured}} reservoirs {{have attracted}} an increased interest of {{exploration and production}} geophysics in recent years. In many instances, natural fractures control the permeability of the reservoir, and hence the ability to find and characterize fractured areas of the reservoir represents a major challenge for seismic investigations. In fractured and porous reservoirs the fluid affects elastic anisotropy of the rock and also causes significant frequency dependent attenuation and dispersion. In this study we develop a mathematical model for seismic wave attenuation and dispersion in a porous medium in a porous medium with aligned fractured, caused by wave <b>induced</b> <b>fluid</b> flow between pores and fractures. In this work fractures in the porous rock are modelled as very thin and highly porous layers in a porous background. Dry highly porous materials have low elastic moduli; thus dry skeleton of our system contains thin and soft layers, and is described by linear slip theory. The fluid saturated rock with high-porasity layers is described by equations of poroelasticity with periodically varying coefficients. These equations are analyzed using propagator matrix approach commonly used to study effective properties of layered system. This yields a dispersion equation for a periodically layered saturated porous medium taking into account fluid communication between pore spaces of the layers. Taking in this dispersion equation a limit of small thickness for high-porosity layers gives the velocity and attenuation {{as a function of}} frequency and fracture parameters. The results of this analysis show that porous saturated rock with aligned fractures exhibits significant attenuation and velocity dispersion due to wave <b>induced</b> <b>fluid</b> flow between pores and fractures. At low frequencies the material properties are equal to those obtained by anisotropic Gassmann theory applied to a porous material with linear-slip, interfaces. At high frequencies the results are equivalent to those for fractures with vanishingly small normal slip in a solid (non-porous) background. The characteristic frequency of the attenuation and dispersion depends on the background permeability, fluid viscosity, as well as fracture density and spacing. The wave <b>induced</b> <b>fluid</b> flow between pores and fractures considered in this work has exactly the same physical nature as so-called squirt flow, which is widely believed to by a major cause of seismic attenuation. Hence, the present model {{can be viewed as a}} new model of squirt-flow attenuation, consistent with Biot’s theory of poroelasticity. The theoretical results of this work are also limited by the assumption of periodic distribution of fractures. In reality fractures may be distributed in a random fashion. Sensitivity of our results to the violation of the periodicity assumption was examined numerically using reflectivity modelling for layered poroelastic media. Numerical experiments for a random distribution of fractures of the same thickness still show surprisingly good agreement with theoretical results obtained for periodic fractures. However this agreement may break down if fracture properties are allowed to vary from fracture to fracture. The results of this thesis show how to compute frequency dependences of attenuation and velocity caused by wave <b>induced</b> <b>fluid</b> flow between pores and fractures. These results can be used to obtain important parameters of fractured reservoirs, such as permeability and fracture weakness, from attenuation measurements. The major requirement for the success of such an approach is that measurements must be made in over a relatively broad frequency range...|$|E

However, thiazolidinediones <b>induce</b> <b>fluid</b> retention, edema, and sometimes precipitate or exacerbate heart failure in a subset of patients. The mechanism through which thiazolidinediones <b>induce</b> <b>fluid</b> retention is controversial. Most studies suggest that this effect results from the increase in tubular sodium and water reabsorption in the kidney, but the role of specific nephron segments and sodium carriers involved is less clear. Some studies suggested that PPARγ agonist stimulates Na+ reabsorption in the collecting duct by activating epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), either directly or through serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase- 1 (SGK- 1). However, other studies did not confirm this mechanism and even report the suppression of ENaC. Alternative mechanisms in the collecting duct include stimulation of non-ENaC sodium channel or inhibition of chloride secretion to the tubular lumen. In addition, thiazolidinediones may augment sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule by stimulating the expression and activity of apical Na+/H+ exchanger- 3 and basolateral Na+- cotransporter {{as well as of}} Na+,K+-ATPase.

40|$|BACKGROUND: L-Arginine {{has been}} shown to induce fluid {{secretion}} in human jejunum. Nitric oxide, a derivative of L-arginine is thought to have an important role as an intestinal secretagogue. AIM: To determine the effect of L-arginine and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, nitro L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), on fluid and electrolyte movement in rat jejunum. METHODS: A 25 cm segment of rat jejunum was perfused in situ with iso-osmotic solutions containing either (1) saline, (2) D-arginine 20, (3) L-arginine 20, (4) L-NAME 0. 1, 1, or 20 mmol/l, or (5) a combination of L-arginine 20 and L-NAME 0. 1, 1, or 20 mmol/l. In further groups the effect of a subcutaneous injection of L-NAME 100 mg/kg was examined in rats pretreated with either D-or L-arginine 500 mg/kg. RESULTS: L-Arginine, unlike D-arginine, <b>induced</b> <b>fluid</b> secretion despite being better absorbed (mean - 7. 3 v 17. 0 microliters/min/g; p < 0. 01). L-NAME at 0. 1 mmol/l had no effect on basal fluid movement but reversed L-arginine induced secretion (7. 8; p < 0. 05). L-NAME at 1 and 20 mmol/l <b>induced</b> <b>fluid</b> secretion (- 15. 4 and - 28. 4, respectively), which was enhanced by the addition of L-arginine (- 30. 0 and - 41. 0, respectively; both p < 0. 05). A subcutaneous injection of L-NAME resulted in marked fluid secretion (- 39. 9) and histological evidence of intestinal ischaemia. These changes were attenuated or reversed by pretreatment with subcutaneous L- but not D-arginine. CONCLUSIONS: L-arginine induces intestinal fluid secretion through production of nitric oxide. There is a delicate balance between the effect of nitric oxide as a secretagogue and its effect on maintaining blood flow and thus preventing intestinal ischaemia...|$|E

The secretory response to C 2 toxin was initiated after a lag period of 1 to 2 h and increased gradually for at least 10 h. The activity of C 2 toxin was enhanced by treatment with trypsin and abolished by neutralization with anti-component I or anti-component II sera. Neither component I nor component II alone induced the fluid accumulation in intestinal loops. The intestinal loop activity was demonstrated with the culture supernatants of strains of Clostridium botulinum types C and D that produced C 2 toxin, but not with culture supernatants of strains that did not. None of the botulinum type A through F neurotoxins <b>induced</b> <b>fluid</b> accumulation in mouse intestinal loops. The results indicate that, in addition to lethal and vascular permeability activities, C 2 toxin has an enterotoxic activity for which the cooperation of components I and II is necessary. The fluid accumulation in intestinal loops inoculated with C 2 toxin was not diminished by removal of the toxin from the loops. Moreover, the secretory response was positive when intestinal lumina were exposed to component II followed by {{the removal of the}} component and inoculation with component I, but it was negative when the intestinal lumina were exposed to component I followed by the removal of the component and inoculation with component II.
