25|$|During {{this same}} period, the US Army Air Force became {{interested}} in a very-high accuracy system for bombing pinpoint targets. Raytheon won a contract to develop a system called Cytac, which used the same basic techniques as LF LORAN, but included considerable automation to handle the timing internally without operator intervention. This proved to be extremely successful, with test-runs placing the aircraft within 10 yards of the target. As the mission changed from short-range tactical bombing to over-the-pole nuclear delivery, the (newly formed) US Air Force lost interest in the concept. Nevertheless, they continued <b>experimentation</b> with the <b>equipment</b> after adapting it to work on LF LORAN frequencies and renaming it Cyclan, lowering accuracy compared to the original, but providing reasonable accuracy {{on the order of}} a mile at greatly increased distances.|$|R

A very basic problem in {{manufacturing}} advanced composites is the occurrence of defects, such as voids, delamination, resin rich areas, distorted fibers and foreign material inclusions. Of these defects, voids are the unavoidable defects mostly coming {{from a variety of}} reasons, including resin type, poor vacuum source, air entrapment, leakage of vacuum bag and by-products formed during the curing cycle of laminates. These voids seriously affect the mechanical properties of composite panels, and cause severe damages during the service. In the present study, various destructive testing techniques, such as visual, burn-out or ignition loss of cured composites, image analysis and matrix digestion or acid digestive were used on advanced composite panels at various porosity levels (e. g., 0 - 2 %, 3 - 6 % and greater than 7 %), and the obtained results were compared each other. Also, testing parameters were optimized using the standard samples to achieve maximum possible error free data of voids, fiber volume, fiber wash, inter laminar and trans laminar cracks, miss-oriented fibers, lay-up orders and latent defects. Optimization of parameters was performed using the design of experiments. We determined that the test results were significantly changed based on the test techniques, composite samples, as well as testing time, operator skill, cost of <b>experimentation,</b> initial <b>equipment</b> cost, pre and post treatments and lack of standardized testing patterns...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{growth of}} {{interest}} of teachers {{to introduce the}} use of computer as educational tool encourages the development of didactic environments so {{that the use of}} computer classrooms and the resources of the web become daily tools. An aspect of distance education not currently supported by most support environments – commercial and experimental – is related to the possibility of performing laboratory exercises remotely. In the present paper, we illustrate on-going research activities and experimentations within the project LABNET 2 of the Italian Interuniversity Computer Science Consortium (CINI) in the National Laboratory for Multimedia and Telematics (ITEM) in Naples. ITEM runs a set of projects, called LABNET, for the experimentation of technologies of remote access to laboratories. Such projects foresee the creation of laboratories, into which real technical-scientific equipments are remotely accessible to teachers and students. Such objective is achieved through the realization of a suitable computer and network infrastructure and the development of necessary software applications. The research activities described here are aimed at remote management of a physics laboratory. By taking advantage of telematics and multimedia technologies, some experiments available in the Physics laboratory (called LAFIDIN) of the Engineering Faculty of the Federico II University of Naples have been made controllable remotely over the Internet. The remote management allows students to perform <b>experimentations,</b> control <b>equipments</b> and visualize the results of the experiments as if these were performed locally. The access to a real laboratory, even if realized through remote control, aims at a greater didactic effectiveness when compared to conventional techniques of virtual laboratories, supported by advanced environments for distance learning. In this paper, we discuss also results of trials run in cooperation with 10 high school institutes of the district of Naples and Avellino. Students performed physics experiments on remote equipments through Internet connection from their schools. During the execution of the experiments, students had the possibility to have a complete vision of what happens in the laboratory through a remote controlled video camera. The camera helps to improve the pedagogical effectiveness of the experiments, remarking the difference with computer simulated experiments...|$|R
30|$|In {{the image}} {{acquisition}} session, the telescopes and mounts were previously assembled {{by the instructor}} to focus the session mostly on taking pictures. The sessions took place during gray nights (when the half-moon {{is present in the}} night sky) to allow for simple astrophotography of our satellite. Students were required to take long-exposure photographs (defined by the instructors as having an exposure time of over 10 s) of previously assigned deep sky objects (nebulae, open clusters, or globular clusters) or planetary objects. The telescopes were either a Newtonian Celestron Advanced VX 6 ” or a Schmidt-Cassegrain Celestron Advanced VX 8 ”, both set atop an Advanced VX computerized and motorized equatorial mount. A Canon T 5 i DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) camera was attached to the telescope in prime focus through a T-mount adapter. Sessions started after astronomical twilight, to guarantee no additional light pollution. Students were guided and graded by the instructor, requiring them to follow their step-by-step guide for best practices in astrophotography and make decisions based on the actual observing conditions and the performance of the instruments on-site. The acquisition of images of the longest exposure time permitted by the quality of the tracking of the telescope mount or by light pollution was a requirement of the session. Students were questioned and graded jointly as a group during these sessions, allowing for joint decision-making and support by fellow classmates. Collaborative learning where groups work together to construct methods for approaching problems and get feedback on their ideas from their peers has been shown to increase confidence and reduce anxiety (Lavasani and Khandan 2011). Following the constructivist spirit of the course, students were expected to build upon previous knowledge from the theoretical sessions and experience from the practical session, group consensus, and <b>experimentation</b> with the <b>equipment</b> to make and support their decisions. Grades were assigned based on the criteria behind their decisions; decisions which result in higher quality images (less noise, more light, and enhanced detail) are assigned higher grades.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Experimental learning, {{traditionally}} {{conducted in}} on-campus laboratory venues, {{is the cornerstone}} of science and engineering education. In order to ensure that engineering graduates are exposed to ‘real-world’ situations and attain the necessary professional skill-sets, as mandated by course accreditation bodies such as Engineers Australia, face-to-face laboratory <b>experimentation</b> with real <b>equipment</b> has been an integral component of traditional engineering education. The online delivery of engineering coursework endeavours to mimic this with remote and simulated laboratory experimentation. To satisfy student and accreditation requirements, the common practice has been to offer equivalent remote and/or simulated laboratory experiments in lieu of the ones delivered, face-to face, on campus. The current implementations of both remote and simulated laboratories tend to be specified with a focus on technical characteristics, instead of pedagogical requirements. This work attempts to redress this situation by developing a framework for the investigation of the suitability of different experimental educational environments to deliver quality teaching and learning. PURPOSE For the tertiary education sector involved with technical or scientific training, a research framework capable of assessing the affordances of laboratory venues is an important aid during the planning, designing and evaluating stages of face-to-face and online (or cyber) environments that facilitate student experimentation. Providing quality experimental learning venues has been identified as one of the distance-education providers’ greatest challenges. DESIGN/METHOD The investigation draws on the expertise of staff at three Australian universities: Swinburne University of Technology (SUT), Curtin University (Curtin) and Queensland University of Technology (QUT). The aim was to analyse video recorded data, in order to identify the occurrences of kikan-shido (a Japanese term meaning ‘between desks instruction’ and over-the-shoulder learning and teaching (OTST/L) events, thereby ascertaining the pedagogical affordances in face-to-face laboratories. RESULTS These will be disseminated at a Master Class presentation at this conference. DISCUSSION Kikan-shido occurrences did reflect on the affordances of the venue. Unlike with other data collection methods, video recorded data and its analysis is repeatable. Participant bias is minimised or even eradicated and researcher bias tempered by enabling re-coding by others. CONCLUSIONS Framework facilitates the identification of experiential face-to-face learning venue affordances. Investigation will continue with on-line venues...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} studied real-time interaction {{over the}} Internet (RTI 2) {{in the context}} of remote experimentation where there is typically a person at the client side interacting with physical equipments at the server side. Remote <b>experimentations</b> of mechatronic <b>equipment</b> have strong real-time constraints due to the dynamical evolution of the behaviors to be observed and controlled. The objective of this dissertation is to propose solutions that provide the best possible feedback to the user such that the drawbacks inherent to the distance between the client and the remote equipment are minimized while providing sufficient information about the equipment state and its operational conditions. In the ideal solution, the information representing the state of the remote equipment are rendered at the same pace it has been acquired, with a minimal time delay between the acquisition phase and the rendering phase. Solutions are proposed to approach as closely as possible to this ideal solution despite the inherent variability of the Internet and the versatility of the devices used by the clients. To characterize the feedback provided to the user, a definition for the RTI 2 Quality of Service is proposed which includes three properties: the level of interaction, the accuracy of dynamic rendering and the wealth of semantic content. As these three properties cannot be directly measured, three related metrics are defined. The metrics definition relies on two abstractions; the first one defines a block as a unit of information that fully describes the state and the conditions of operation of the remote equipment at a given time. The second abstraction defines an end-to-end structure that includes the communication link and both the server and the client devices. The estimated metrics are the block end-to-end round trip time, the block duration ratio and the block size ratio. To guarantee a given quality of service, a cascade end-to-end adaptation structure is proposed. This control scheme is designed to track the block round trip time by adapting the block size. The adaptation scheme and the underlying model are validated with real-world measurements. A mechanism called TCP Most-Recent is proposed as an enhancement to the TCP protocol. It alleviates the problem related to the TCP buffering mechanism, thus improving the data transmission delay. This mechanism is especially useful for applications that send perishable data as in RTI 2. Perishable data are data with limited time validity, thus resending this outdated data is useless and inefficient. The tradeoff in using TCP-MR is to accept possible losses in order to gain interactivity. Such a tradeoff can be limited if the adaptation, carried out at the application level, chooses the data to be discarded according to some criteria specified at the user level. This dissertation proposes a broad but consistent foundation for studying RTI 2 {{in the context of}} remote experimentation. It is build around three main contributions. First, based on the identified objectives of a successful interaction, the quality of service for RTI 2 in the context of remote experimentation is defined. The associated metrics and abstractions permitting to work at the right level are also defined. Second, using the provided metrics and abstractions, an adaptation scheme to enforce the QoS provided to the user is proposed and successfully validated. Third, a mechanism called TCP Most-Recent has been proposed to improve the information transmission delay without breaking the Internet best practice...|$|R
