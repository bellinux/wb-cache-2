40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the problem of}} determining diagnostic information {{for the purpose of}} testing a complex technical object. To this end, the essence of the development of the functional-diagnostic model was presented and described on the example of the wind power plant. Based on the developed model of the object, diagnostic information has been determined, which consists of two components: a set of basic elements and a set of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signals,</b> which are worked out by the designated elements in the functional groups of the object. An important aspect in this paper is the shift in the pro bono definition of a set of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signals.</b> Knowledge of the set of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signals</b> and their nominal (master) signals is the basis for determining the range of changes in <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signals</b> that are the basis for the diagnosis of an object using the intelligent diagnostic system (DIAG  2) or using knowledge bases for expert systems.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} fault detection, isolation and identification (FDII) scheme based on Wavelet Entropy (WE) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for reaction wheels (RW) that are employed as actuators in the attitude control subsystem (ACS) of a satellites to perform the formation flying (FF) missions. In this thesis two FDII approaches are proposed, i) Spacecraft-level fault diagnosis and ii) Formation-level fault diagnosis. In the "spacecraft-level" fault diagnosis scheme in order to analysis faults, absolute attitude and angular measurements from a satellite are considered as <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signals.</b> In order to detect the fault, the wavelet-entropy technique is employed on <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signals</b> and the sum of the absolute wavelet entropies (SAWE) of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signals</b> are obtained and compared with an appropriately selected threshold. If the SAWE passes the threshold the faulty condition is established. In order to isolate the fault in a satellite the angular velocity measurements in a satellite are considered as <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signals</b> and the relative wavelet energy (RWE) of these signals are obtained and compared to a threshold. In our proposed fault identification scheme, the attitude measurements in a satellite are considered and the detail and approximation coefficients of the wavelet signals are obtained and these coefficients are used as inputs to an artificial neural network to identify the type of the fault in a satellite. Using a confusion matrix evaluation system we demonstrate that our spacecraft-level FDII can detect, isolate and identify the high severity faults in a satellite however this scheme cannot detect low severity faults in a satellite. Our proposed "formation-level" FDII scheme utilizes data collected from the relative attitudes and relative angular velocity measurements of the formation flying satellites. In this fault diagnosis scheme, the relative attitude and relative angular velocity measurements in a satellite with respect to each its neighbor's in a formation are considered as <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signals.</b> In order to detect the fault, the relative attitude measurements in a satellite are considered as <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signals.</b> The wavelet-entropy technique is utilized on <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signals</b> and the SAWEs with respect to each satellite's neighbor are obtained. These SAWEs are then compared with an appropriately selected threshold. The faulty satellite is determined if these SAWEs pass the thresholds. In order to isolate the fault in a faulty satellite, the relative angular velocity measurements are considered as <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signals.</b> The RWE of these signals are obtained and compared to a threshold. In our proposed fault identification scheme, the relative attitude measurements in a satellite are considered as <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signals.</b> In this scheme, the RWEs of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signals</b> are obtained and used as inputs to an artificial neural network to identify the type of the fault in a satellite.

The proposed method generates a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>signal</b> which indicates possible faults {{occurring in the}} GCPV plant.
