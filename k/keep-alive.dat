50|$|The <b>keep-alive</b> {{extension}} to HTTP 1.1 allows persistent TCP connections for multiple request/responses. This accelerates {{access to the}} web server due to less and optimised network traffic. The disadvantage of these persistent connections is that server resources are blocked even though no data is exchanged between client and server. mod_qos allows a server to support <b>keep-alive</b> as long as sufficient connections are free, stopping the <b>keep-alive</b> support when a defined connection threshold is reached.|$|E

50|$|Library {{provides}} UDP session management (connect, disconnect, <b>keep-alives,</b> {{sliding window}} for messages and message sequence numbers) and supports {{any number of}} concurrent sessions. Library contains standard Intelligent Platform Management Interface encryption algorithms for authentication (RAKP-HMAC-SHA1), integrity (HMAC-SHA1-96) and confidentiality (AES-CBC-128), however additional algorithms can be provided. Library contains encoders and decoders for event log, sensor values and hardware information (FRU - Field Replaceable Unit). Library can be extended with additional, user-defined encoders.|$|R
5000|$|In {{place of}} or in {{addition}} to the <b>keep-alive</b> electrode some krytrons may contain a very tiny amount of radioactive material (usually less than [...] of nickel-63), which emits beta particles (high-speed electrons) to make ionization easier. The radiation source serves to increase the reliability of ignition and formation of the <b>keep-alive</b> electrode discharge.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} table {{shows the}} makeup of a SLARP cHDLC <b>keep-alive</b> frame.|$|E
5000|$|The sender {{sequence}} number increments with each <b>keep-alive</b> sent by this sender.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{only three}} types of SLARP frame are defined: address {{requests}} (0x00), address replies (0x01), and <b>keep-alive</b> frames (0x02).|$|E
50|$|The DSG {{specification}} {{defines a}} special downstream <b>keep-alive</b> message {{so that the}} set-top can recognize an appropriate downstream channel.|$|E
5000|$|Ability {{to handle}} more than 10,000 {{simultaneous}} connections {{with a low}} memory footprint (~2.5 MB per 10k inactive HTTP <b>keep-alive</b> connections) ...|$|E
5000|$|A krytron {{has four}} electrodes. Two are a {{conventional}} anode and cathode. One is a <b>keep-alive</b> electrode, arranged {{to be close}} to the cathode. The <b>keep-alive</b> has a low positive voltage applied, which causes a small area of gas to ionize near the cathode. High voltage is applied to the anode, but primary conduction does not occur until a positive pulse is applied to the trigger electrode ("Grid" [...] in the image above). Once started, arc conduction carries a considerable current.|$|E

5000|$|Under HTTP 1.0, {{there is}} no {{official}} specification for how keepalive operates. It was, in essence, added to an existing protocol. If the client supports <b>keep-alive,</b> it adds an additional header to the request: ...|$|E
50|$|Switching {{performance}} is largely {{independent of the}} environment (temperature, acceleration, vibration, etc.). However, {{the formation of the}} <b>keep-alive</b> glow discharge is more sensitive, which necessitates the use of a radioactive source to aid its ignition.|$|E
50|$|This {{excitation}} or <b>keep-alive</b> circuit {{was absolutely}} necessary for single-phase rectifiers {{such as the}} excitron and for mercury-arc rectifiers used in the high-voltage supply of radiotelegraphy transmitters, as current flow was regularly interrupted every time the Morse key was released.|$|E
5000|$|Grid {{computing}} {{is seen as}} {{a solution}} to the rescue issues of PSEs for mobile devices. This is made possible through a [...] "Brokering Service". This service is started by an initiating device that sends the necessary information for PSE to resolve task. The brokering service then breaks this down into subtasks that distributes the information to various subordinate devices that perform these subtasks. The brokering necessitates an Active Agent Repository (AAR) and a Task Allocation Table (TAT) that both work to manage the subtasks. A <b>keep-Alive</b> Server is tapped to handle communication between the brokering service and the subordinate devices. The <b>Keep-Alive</b> server relies on a lightweight client application installed in the participating mobile devices.|$|E
50|$|BGP neighbors, called peers, are {{established}} by manual configuration between routers {{to create a}} TCP session on port 179. A BGP speaker sends 19-byte <b>keep-alive</b> messages every 60 seconds to maintain the connection. Among routing protocols, BGP is unique in using TCP as its transport protocol.|$|E
50|$|Connection level control: mod_qos {{controls}} {{the number of}} TCP connections to the web server. This helps limit the connections coming from a single client or from unknown networks, {{in order to reduce}} the maximum number of concurrent connections to a virtual server or to implement dynamic HTTP <b>keep-alive</b> settings.|$|E
50|$|In {{other types}} of mercury-arc valve, the arc is ignited just once when the valve is first energised, and {{thereafter}} remains permanently established, alternating between the main anode(s) and a low-power auxiliary anode or <b>keep-alive</b> circuit. Moreover, control grids are {{required in order to}} adjust the timing of the start of conduction.|$|E
50|$|Acknowledgement of the {{connect request}} by the IO Device allows {{parameterization}} to follow. From this point forward, both the IO Device and IO Controller start exchanging cyclic process I/O data frames. The process I/O data frames don't contain valid data at this point, but they start serving as <b>keep-alive</b> {{to keep the}} watchdog from expiring.|$|E
50|$|Using the Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP), a PE can add {{itself to}} a pool or remove it from by {{requesting}} a registration or deregistration from an arbitrary PR of the operation scope. In case of successful registration, the PR chosen for registration becomes the PE's Home-PR (PR-H). A PR-H not only informs the other PRs of the operation scope about the registration or deregistration of its PEs, it also monitors the availability of its PEs by ASAP <b>Keep-Alive</b> messages. A <b>keep-alive</b> message by a PR-H has to be acknowledged by the PE within a certain time interval. If the PE fails to answer within a certain timeout, it {{is assumed to be}} dead and immediately removed from the handlespace. Furthermore, a PE is expected to re-register regularly. At a re-registration, it is also possible for the PE to change its list of transport addresses or its policy information.|$|E
50|$|HTTP {{persistent}} connection, {{also called}} HTTP <b>keep-alive,</b> or HTTP connection reuse, {{is the idea}} of using a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses, as opposed to opening a new connection for every single request/response pair. The newer HTTP/2 protocol uses the same idea and takes it further to allow multiple concurrent requests/responses to be multiplexed over a single connection.|$|E
5000|$|From {{production}} aspect, Waarp R66 proposed {{local administration}} interface (HTTPS) or central ones (GUI). It optimizes {{the usage of}} the network (using multiplexing, bandwidth throttling, proxy support, <b>Keep-alive</b> and timeout, ...) or the usage of other resources (cpu and memory). It allows a high availability installation {{and the support of}} horizontal scalability with a high parallel transfer capability (in theory up to 2^64).|$|E
50|$|The gas filling {{provides}} ions for neutralizing {{the space}} charge and allowing high currents at lower voltage. The <b>keep-alive</b> discharge populates the gas with ions, forming a preionized plasma; this can shorten the arc formation time by 3-4 {{orders of magnitude}} in comparison with non-preionized tubes, as time {{does not have to}} be spent on ionizing the medium during formation of the arc path.|$|E
50|$|The type is a 1-byte ASCII {{character}} used {{to indicate}} the type of the data following it. The ASCII characters were chosen to make manually walking and debugging data stored in the UBJSON format as easy as possible (e.g. making the data relatively readable in a hex editor). Types are available for the five JSON value types. There is also a no-op type used for stream <b>keep-alive.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are two {{prominent}} techniques used today to create Internet maps. The first {{works on the}} data plane of the Internet and is called active probing. It is used to infer Internet topology based on router adjacencies. The second works on the control plane and infers autonomous system connectivity based on BGP data. A BGP speaker sends 19-byte <b>keep-alive</b> messages every 60 seconds to maintain the connection.|$|E
5000|$|... "Games Workshop and Bryan Ansell {{have got}} {{together}} to <b>keep-alive</b> Citadel Miniatures, a new miniatures company {{that will be}} manufacturing several ranges of figures. Ral Partha are already in production, but Citadel will also be producing own ranges, including the Fiend Factory figures, Fantasy Adventurers and Fantasy Specials. Citadel will not be limiting production to SF/F figures, but also new ranges of historical wargaming figures".|$|E
50|$|NAT-PMP {{runs over}} the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and uses port number 5351. It has no {{built-in}} authentication mechanisms because forwarding a port typically {{does not allow}} any activity that could not also be achieved using STUN methods. The benefit of NAT-PMP over STUN {{is that it does}} not require a STUN server and a NAT-PMP mapping has a known expiration time, allowing the application to avoid sending inefficient <b>keep-alive</b> packets.|$|E
50|$|The HTTP {{kernel mode}} driver in Windows Vista, Http.sys has been {{enhanced}} to support server-side authentication, logging, IDN hostnames, Event Tracing and better manageability through netsh http and new performance counters. WinINet, the protocol handler for HTTP and FTP handles IPv6 literal addresses, includes support for Gzip and deflate decompression to improve content encoding performance, Internationalized domain names support and Event Tracing. WinHTTP, the client API for server-based applications and services supports IPv6, AutoProxy, HTTP/1.1 chunked transfer encoding, larger data uploads, SSL and client certificates, server and proxy authentication, automatic handling of redirects and <b>keep-alive</b> connections and HTTP/1.0 protocol, including support for <b>keep-alive</b> (persistent) connections and session cookies. Winsock has been updated with new APIs {{and support for}} Event Tracing. Winsock Layered Service Provider support has been enhanced with logged installations and removals, a new API for reliably installing LSPs, a command to reliably remove LSPs, facilities to categorize LSPs and to remove most LSPs from the processing path for system critical services and support for Network Diagnostics Framework.|$|E
50|$|Other {{programs}} periodically poll {{for events}} {{by going to}} sleep and resuming execution after a specific interval of time. Once execution is resumed, the program polls for events or status changes, and then services any that occurred while it was asleep. After servicing the events, the program then goes to sleep again for the next time interval. Certain kinds of heartbeat events or <b>keep-alive</b> signals can be generated by these kinds of programs.|$|E
50|$|The iMessage {{protocol}} {{is based}} on the Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)—a proprietary, binary protocol. It sets up a <b>Keep-Alive</b> connection with the Apple servers. Every connection has its own unique code, which acts as an identifier for the route that should be used {{to send a message to}} a specific device. The connection is encrypted with TLS using a client-side certificate, that is requested by the device on the activation of iMessage.|$|E
50|$|The {{challenge}} with VoIP on mobile devices {{is to make}} sure that the device is ready to receive incoming calls while keeping the power consumption as low as possible. Due to the inherent mobility of mobile devices, the network conditions change often and frequent SIP re-registrations and <b>keep-alive</b> traffic are needed to make sure the mobile client is properly registered and will receive incoming call at all times. This has a significant impact on battery life.|$|E
50|$|Now, several {{commercial}} and open-source RADIUS servers exist. Features can vary, but most {{can look up}} the users in text files, LDAP servers, various databases, etc. Accounting records can be written to text files, various databases, forwarded to external servers, etc. SNMP is often used for remote monitoring and <b>keep-alive</b> checking of a RADIUS server. RADIUS proxy servers are used for centralized administration and can rewrite RADIUS packets on the fly (for security reasons, or to convert between vendor dialects).|$|E
50|$|UDP hole {{punching}} establishes connectivity {{between two}} hosts communicating across {{one or more}} network address translators. Typically, third-party hosts on the public transit network are used to establish UDP port states {{that may be used}} for direct communications between the communicating hosts. Once port state has been successfully established and the hosts are communicating, port state may be maintained either by normal communications traffic, or in the prolonged absence thereof, by <b>keep-alive</b> packets, usually consisting of empty UDP packets or packets with minimal non-intrusive content.|$|E
50|$|Hosts with network {{connectivity}} inside a private network connected via a NAT to the Internet typically use the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) method or Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) {{to determine the}} public address of the NAT that its communications peers require. In this process another host on the public network is used to establish port mapping and other UDP port state that {{is assumed to be}} valid for direct communication between the application hosts. Since UDP state usually expires after short periods of time in the range of tens of seconds to a few minutes, and the UDP port is closed in the process, UDP hole punching employs the transmission of periodic <b>keep-alive</b> packets, each renewing the life-time counters in the UDP state machine of the NAT.|$|E
