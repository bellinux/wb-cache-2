5|$|In {{southern}} Italy and southwestern Spain, the {{snakelocks anemone}} (Anemonia viridis) is consumed as a delicacy. The whole animal is marinated in vinegar, then coated in a batter {{similar to that}} used to make calamari and deep-fried <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> oil.|$|E
5|$|Hummus is {{a staple}} in Palestinian side dishes, in {{particular}} in hummus bi tahini, in which boiled, ground beans are mixed with tahini (sesame paste) and sometimes lemon juice. Hummus is often slathered <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> oil and sometimes sprinkled with paprika, oregano and pine nuts; the latter are especially popular in the West Bank. Chick peas are also mixed with ful (fava beans), resulting {{in an entirely different}} dish, mukhluta, with a distinct flavor and brownish color.|$|E

40|$|Two field {{experiments}} were carried out-with three and five treatments, respectively-to study the persistence and metabolism of fenthion <b>in</b> <b>olives.</b> Fenthion showed a low degradation rate, with a half-life of ca. 38 days. This {{accounts for a}} noteworthy effect {{of the number of}} treatments on the residue amounts at harvest time. Besides the active ingredient, five metabolites were detected in olives; among these, fenthion sulfoxide and fenoxon sulfoxide were quantitatively the most important. Olives were also processed into oil, and the partitioning of fenthion among oil, cake, and vegetation water was evaluated. Fenthion residues in oil were ca. 3 times higher than <b>in</b> <b>olives,</b> while its metabolites showed analogous residues <b>in</b> <b>olives</b> and oil or were totally absent...|$|R
30|$|However, the {{treatment}} of olives by the ABA at fruit set causes a drop in contents PE from veraison, the decrease was observed <b>in</b> <b>olives</b> controls {{towards the end of}} ripening. Similarly, PG activities are increasing rapidly at the beginning of ripening, something found <b>in</b> <b>olives</b> controls at the end of ripening. In addition, {{the treatment}} of olives at veraison contained no significant difference in these enzyme activities during the ripening of the olives.|$|R
5|$|Some United States Army Air Forces {{aircraft}} used {{a variation}} of the British camouflage schemes (mostly on aircraft originally built to RAF orders) but most USAAF aircraft did not use multiple shades on the top side of the aircraft. Instead, most were camouflaged <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> drab above and neutral gray below, though some had the edges of flying surfaces painted in medium green. In the later stages of the war camouflage was often dispensed with, both to save time in manufacturing and to reduce weight, leaving aircraft with a natural metal finish.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies have}} found that deep frying <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> and {{sunflower}} oils {{has been found to be}} less of a detriment to health and in some cases have positive effects on insulin levels. Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids. However, excessive use of the same oil can cause it to break down and release compounds into the food that may be carcinogenic, affect liver health, or influence the body's ability to absorb vitamins. Some European countries have set public health standards for the safety of frying oil.|$|E
5|$|The Mediterranean {{theme of}} the book is {{emphasised}} in the section on vegetables, in which there are five aubergine recipes and only one potato dish (pommes Anna). Dishes from Greece and North Africa are included along with typical southern French standards such as tomates provençales. The occasional non-Mediterranean dish is included, including cèpes à la bordelaise (fried <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> oil with parsley and garlic).|$|E

5|$|The cooking of {{the area}} {{is not to be}} {{confused}} with the Mediterranean diet, made popular because of the apparent health benefits of a diet rich <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> oil, wheat and other grains, fruits, vegetables, and a certain amount of seafood, but low in meat and dairy products. Mediterranean cuisine encompasses the ways that these and other ingredients, including meat, are dealt with in the kitchen, whether they are health-giving or not.|$|E
5|$|William J. Fields {{was born}} December 29, 1874 in Willard, Carter County, Kentucky. He {{was the fourth}} of twelve {{children}} born to Christopher C. and Alice (Rucker) Fields. He was educated in the local public schools, then matriculated to the University of Kentucky. After graduation, he started a real estate business <b>in</b> <b>Olive</b> Hill, Kentucky and engaged in farming. He also studied law on his own.|$|E
5|$|Frying food <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> oil is attested in Classical Greece {{from about}} the 5th century BCE. The late Roman {{cookbook}} of Apicius (c. 400), appears {{to list the}} ancient Romans' first use of deep frying to prepare Pullum Frontonianum, a chicken dish. The practice of deep frying spread {{to other parts of}} Europe and Arabia in the following centuries. Deep-fried foods such as funnel cakes arrived in northern Europe by the 13th century, and deep-fried fish recipes have been found in cookbooks in Spain and Portugal at around the same time. Falafel arrived in the Middle East from population migrations from Egypt as soon as the 14th century. The deep frying of food in Japan was likely introduced by Portuguese the 16th century. Evidence of potato frying can be found as early as the late 17th century in Europe.|$|E
40|$|Biophenolic {{compounds}} {{constitute a}} complex mixture <b>in</b> <b>olives</b> and derived products. In this work, ion-spray tandem mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography {{is applied to}} the identification and quantification of biophenols present in complex matrices such as olives and vegetation waters. The extraction and purification method for the biophenol present in both the matrices is reported. Using this approach the main biophenols found, in three different variety of olives, were: tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, oleoside methyl ester, oleoside dimethyl ester, and oleuropein. In vegetation water the biophenols are present in lower amounts than <b>in</b> <b>olives...</b>|$|R

5|$|Israeli {{salad is}} {{typically}} made with finely chopped tomatoes and cucumbers dressed <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Variations include {{the addition of}} diced red or green bell peppers, grated carrot, finely shredded cabbage or lettuce, sliced radish, fennel, spring onions and chives, chopped parsley, or other herbs and spices such as mint, za'atar and sumac. Although popularized by the kibbutzim, versions of this mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places. For example, Jews from India prepare it with finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.|$|E
5|$|Spain's varied Mediterranean cuisines {{includes}} the cooking of Andalusia, Murcia, Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic islands. Paella is a characteristic Spanish dish, originally from Valencia, radiating {{early on to}} Catalonia and Murcia along Spain's Mediterranean coast. It comes in many versions, and may contain a mixture of chicken, pork, rabbit, or shellfish, sautéed <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> {{oil in a large}} shallow pan, with vegetables, and typically round-grain rice (often of the local albufera, arròs bomba, sénia varieties or similar) cooked to absorb the water and coloured with saffron. The dish may be varied with artichoke hearts, peas, sweet peppers, lima beans, string beans, or sausages.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to those in Italian Food, there are many Italian recipes and descriptions {{of the land and}} the people in David's other works. The first recipe in her first book, Mediterranean Food—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that book are recipes for bocconcini, osso bucco, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the recipes in Summer Cooking is peperonata (pimentos or sweet peppers cooked with tomatoes <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> oil and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that book are substantial essays on Italian people and places. Is There a Nutmeg in the House? includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from Mantua, and another of similar length on the variations of pizza in Italy and beyond.|$|E

5|$|Turkish cuisine is {{regarded}} as one of the most prominent in the world, its popularity is largely owed to the cultural influences of the Ottoman Empire and partly because of its major tourism industry. It is largely the heritage of Ottoman cuisine, which can be described as a fusion and refinement of Central Asian, Caucasian, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Balkan cuisines. The country's position between the East and the Mediterranean Sea helped the Turks gain complete control of major trade routes, and an ideal environment allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was well established by the mid-1400s, the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's six hundred-year reign. Yogurt salads, fish <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> oil, and stuffed and wrapped vegetables became Turkish staples. The empire, eventually spanning from Austria to northern Africa, used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world. By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and passed laws regulating the freshness of food. Since the fall of the empire in World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and western fast food have made their way into the modern Turkish diet.|$|E
