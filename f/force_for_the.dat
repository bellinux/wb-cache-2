5|$|After {{winning a}} clear victory, and as pursuit became too {{hazardous}} near Wake, American forces retired. Spruance once again withdrew {{to the east}} to refuel his destroyers and rendezvous with the carrier Saratoga, which was ferrying much-needed replacement aircraft. Fletcher transferred his flag to Saratoga {{on the afternoon of}} 8 June and resumed command of the carrier <b>force.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> remainder of that day and then 9 June, Fletcher continued to launch search missions from the three carriers to ensure the Japanese were no longer advancing on Midway. Late on 10 June a decision was made to leave the area and the American carriers eventually returned to Pearl Harbor.|$|E

5|$|At the {{commencement}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, the 3rd Australian Brigade—of which the 12th Battalion was part—was designated as the covering <b>force</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ANZAC landing, and as such was the first unit ashore on 25 April 1915, at approximately 04:30. Newland {{was wounded in the}} days following the landing, suffering a gunshot wound to his arm, and was evacuated to the 1st General Hospital. While at the hospital, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 22 May, before returning to the 12th Battalion four days later.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war in Europe, it {{had been}} planned to send the {{division}} to Burma to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. However, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Japanese surrender, ended the war and changed British plans. The 6th Airborne Division was nominated to be the Imperial Strategic Reserve. Together with a Royal Air Force troop-carrier formation, they were to be located in the Middle East as a quick reaction peace keeping <b>force</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> British Empire. Initially No. 283 Wing RAF had two squadrons of transport aircraft, 620 and 644, available to provide troop transport.|$|E
5|$|By early 1944, No.9 Operational Group {{had become}} a static {{garrison}} <b>force</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> New Guinea area, and was renamed Northern Command in April to better reflect its new role. The following month No.71 Wing, now led by Wing Commander Ralph Moran, advanced to Nadzab, where it came {{under the control of}} No.10 Operational Group (later the Australian First Tactical Air Force). There Nos.8 and 100 Squadrons engaged in attacks on Japanese positions in Wewak, each flying over 140 sorties during the month.|$|E

These nine regiments and three battalions were supported by the Inverness and Somerset Artillery Batteries, Royal Horse Artillery, and the Hong Kong and Singapore Artillery Battery.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving <b>force</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.|$|E
5|$|For a given {{topography}} and bathymetry {{the surge}} height is not solely affected by peak wind speed; {{the size of}} the storm also affects the peak surge. With any storm, the area of piled up water can flow out of the storm perimeter, and this escape mechanism is reduced in proportion to the surge <b>force</b> (<b>for</b> <b>the</b> same peak wind speed) when the storm covers more area (storm perimeter length per area is inversely proportional to a circular storm's diameter).|$|E

5|$|In {{each of its}} iterations, {{the brigade}} was not {{organized}} as a permanent formation. Typically it was created only as a temporary front-line unit while larger United States Marine units were formed. The brigade would then merge with these to form a Marine division. The 1942 brigade merged with the 2nd Marine Division, the 1944 brigade {{was the basis for}} the formation of the new 6th Marine Division, and the 1950 brigade acted as an advance <b>force</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> newly reactivated 1st Marine Division before merging into that unit.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the deployment, the division was sent to Fort Polk, Louisiana, to begin training and to fill its ranks. After its basic training was complete, the division was sent to Japan in April 1951 for advanced training and {{to act as a}} reserve <b>force</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Eighth United States Army, then fighting in Korea. The involvement of the National Guard in the fighting in Korea was further expanded when the 40th Infantry Division of the California Army National Guard received warning orders for deployment as well.|$|E

III Corps took charge of the heavy units designed for large, conventional offensive actions.|$|E

5|$|Leading {{elements}} of the 2nd Division reached the 17th Army headquarters area at Kokumbona, west of the Matanikau on 4 November. The same day, Shoji's unit reached Koli Point and made camp. Decimated by battle deaths, combat injuries, malnutrition, and tropical diseases, the 2nd Division was incapable of further offensive action and would fight as a defensive <b>force</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of the campaign. Later in November, U.S. forces drove Shoji's soldiers from Koli Point back to the Kokumbuna area, with a battalion-sized Marine patrol attacking and harassing them almost the entire way. Only about 700 of Shoji's original 3,000 men ultimately returned to Kokumbuna.|$|E
5|$|Maryland steamed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to the 7th Fleet under Admiral Kinkaid.

She, along with four other battleships and numerous cruisers and destroyers, steamed into Leyte Gulf on the morning of 18 October. Maryland took position between Red and White Beaches and began bombarding them ahead of the invasion, which began at 10:00 20 October. Securing the beaches quickly, Maryland then took up a sentinel position in Leyte Gulf to guard the beaches against Japanese counterattack by sea.|$|E
5|$|Operation Barbarossa (German: Unternehmen Barbarossa) was {{the code}} {{name for the}} Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, starting Sunday, 22 June 1941, during World War II.
