They bore him company, not insufficiently--considering, in especial, his fuller resources in that line--while he worked out--to the last lucidity the principle on which he forbore either to seek Fanny out in Cadogan Place or to perpetrate the error of too marked an assiduity in Eaton Square. This error would be his not availing himself to the utmost of the convenience of any artless theory of his constitution, or of Charlotte's, that might prevail there. That artless theories could and did prevail was a fact he had ended by accepting, under copious evidence, as definite and ultimate; and it consorted with common prudence, with the simplest economy of life, not to be wasteful of any odd gleaning. To haunt Eaton Square, in fine, would be {{to show that he}} had not, like his brilliant associate, a sufficiency of work in the world. It was just his having that sufficiency, it was just their having it together, that, so strangely and so blessedly, made, as they put it to each other, everything possible. What further propped up the case, moreover, was that the [...] "world," [...] by still another beautiful perversity of their chance, included Portland Place without including to anything like the same extent Eaton Square. The latter residence, at the same time, it must promptly be added, did, on occasion, wake up to opportunity and, as giving itself a frolic shake, send out a score of invitations--one of which fitful flights, precisely, had, before Easter, the effect of disturbing a little our young man's measure of his margin. Maggie, with a proper spirit, held that her father ought {{from time to time to}} give a really considered dinner, and Mr. Verver, who had as little idea as ever of not meeting expectation, was of the harmonious opinion that his wife ought. Charlotte's own judgment was, always, that they were ideally free--the proof of which would always be, she maintained, that everyone they feared they might most have alienated by neglect would arrive, wreathed with smiles, on the merest hint of a belated signal. Wreathed in smiles, all round, truly enough, these apologetic banquets struck Amerigo as being; they were, frankly, touching occasions to him, marked, in the great London bousculade, with a small, still grace of their own, an investing amenity and humanity. Everybody came, everybody rushed; but all succumbed to the soft influence, and the brutality of mere multitude, of curiosity without tenderness, was put off, at the foot of the fine staircase, with the overcoats and shawls. The entertainment offered a few evenings before Easter, and at which Maggie and he were inevitably present as guests, was a <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> not insistently incurred, and had thereby, possibly, all the more, the note of this almost Arcadian optimism: a large, bright, dull, murmurous, mild-eyed, middle-aged dinner, involving for the most part very bland, though very exalted, immensely announceable and hierarchically placeable couples, and followed, without the oppression of a later contingent, by a brief instrumental concert, over the preparation of which, the Prince knew, Maggie's anxiety had conferred with Charlotte's ingenuity and both had supremely revelled, as it were, in Mr. Verver's solvency.|$|E

40|$|Unidroit has {{recently}} launched an intergovernmental process intended {{to set an}} international non-binding standard for close-out netting legislation. This paper, first, provides insights into {{the question of why}} harmonisation is needed. The colossal exposures inherent in the derivatives, securities lending, repo, forex and similar markets are generally covered by close-out netting provisions, which are contained in the relevant master agreements. Close-out netting reduces mutual exposure by about 80 – 90 %. The ‘net’ exposure is taken as a basis for the calculation of collateral and underlying capital, thus being vital for market participants' risk management, as well as for prudential supervision. Even though most developed markets have adopted netting-friendly legislation, the international nature of the modern financial market complicates enforceability of close-out netting in cross-jurisdictional situations, in particular in insolvency scenarios. Further, the Article explains the current difficulties in transposing the concept of close-out netting across jurisdictional borders and advocates a functional approach alongside the five criteria (immediate <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations?</b> obligations due? obligations of the same kind?). Lastly, it sheds light on the concepts underlying the current UNIDROIT draft principle...|$|E

Večina teorij predvideva pozitivne učinke, saj se poveča učinkovitost poslovanja podjetja, doseže sinergija v ekonomiji obsega, kar je posledica novih kombinacij prej ločenih podjetij ali zmanjševanja stroškov. Prevzemno podjetje pridobi določen delež lastninskih pravic (delež delnic) v prevzetem podjetju, kar mu zagotavlja kontrolni delež za odločilno vplivanje na poslovanje prevzetega podjetja. Katerokoli obliko prevzema je mogoče opraviti s plačili v denarju, z zadolžitvijo podjetja, z zamenjavo za delnice ali druge vrednostne papirje. O združitvi podjetij govorimo, kadar iz dveh ali več podjetij nastane eno samo. Izvedena mora biti v skladu z obstoječo zakonodajo. Znotraj združitev ločimo spojitve in pripojitve. Po uspešno opravljenem prevzemu po navadi pride tudi do združitve podjetij. Prevzemi in združitve vselej prinašajo spremembe in drugačne pristope k opravljanju nalog in doseganju skupnih ciljev. Prevzem mora biti ekonomsko upravičen, torej morata biti prevzemno in prevzeto podjetje po prevzemu vredni več kot vsako posamezno pred prevzemom. Glavna slabost združitev je samodejen prevzem vseh znanih in neznanih obveznosti prevzetega podjetja. Za uspešne združitve in prevzeme podjetij je potrebno narediti podroben poslovni načrt, oceniti vse elemente tržne, proizvodne, organizacijske in kadrovske narave, ki vplivajo na pričakovane donose in vrednost podjetja. Če bi Mercator prevzel Merkur, bi ta združitev podjetij prinesla precej priložnosti, ki bi še povečale pozitiven učinek prevzema. Mercator bi lahko dosegel svoj strateški cilj in postal največji trgovec v jugovzhodni Evropi. Hitrejša rast v podjetju bi prinesla boljše poslovne rezultate, trgovsko mrežo bi lahko posodabljali, vodenje strateške poslovne politike bi bilo lažje in dolgoročno bi se lahko maksimirala vrednost podjetja. Finančno in poslovno okrepljeni Mercator bi lahko še agresivneje nastopal na sedanjih in novih trgih s celovito zaključenim prodajnim programom. S skupnim nastopom na prodajnih trgih bi se zmanjšali stroški in povečala učinkovitost. Zmanjševalo bi se tudi poslovno tveganje. Z razširitvijo trgovske mreže, z novimi površinami in s skupnim nastopom novega podjetja na prodajnih trgih bi imeli koristi tudi potrošniki. Due to {{globalisation}} takeovers {{have got}} to be part of everyday routine. Most theories foresee positive effects for not only is the business efficiency of the company increased but also the synergy of the economy of the extent of business operation is achieved all of which is direct consequence of new combinations of formerly separated companies or direct consequence of reduction of costs. The takeover company acquires a certain share of ownership rights (stock share) of the company which is has taken over and the said share provides supervision share which makes it possible for the takeover company to discharge crucial influence upon the operation of the company which has been taken over. Any form of takeover can be performed through payments in cash, indebtedness of the company, exchange of stocks or other securities. Takeover is defined as the case where two or more companies are merged into a single one in that is has to be performed in accordance with the existing legislature. As far as merger goes there are fusions and annexations. A successfully discharged takeover is usually followed by a merger of the companies in question. As regards the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> and achievements of mutual goals takeovers and mergers always bring about changes and different attitudes. A takeover has to be economically justified hence the takeover company and the taken-over company have to be worth more than before it. The main drawback of a merger is automatic acceptance of all known as well as unknown liabilities of the taken-over company. A successful takeover and merger of companies calls for a precise business plan thus all the elements of marketing, production, organizational and personnel management nature, which can influence the anticipated revenues and values of the company, have to be thoroughly studied and assessed. If "Mercator" should takeover "Merkur" the merger would provide a number of opportunities which would enhance the positive effects of the takeover in that "Mercator" would be able to achieve its strategic goal in getting to be the largest merchant of Southeast Europe. A faster growth of the company would bring about better business results, the trading network could be brought up to date, strategic business policy would be easier and, in the long run, the value of the company would be maximized. It would be possible for the financially invigorated "Mercator" to do business not only on its current markets but also on new ones more aggressively {{with the help of an}} integrally balanced sales program. Through mutual appearance on various markets costs could be minimized and efficiency could be increased whereby business risks would be reduced. The consumers, too, would gain a lot through expansion of sales network, new sales space and joint appearance of the new joint company on the market...|$|E

It can be {{traditionally}} {{argued that}} since Roman times guaranteeing in Europe {{has been a}} widely used way of securing obligations, which is also applied in Lithuania, however the increased number of persons unable to meet their obligations during the financial crisis has affected {{the interests of the}} creditors and state. In addition, during the financial crisis and after it the guaranteeing institute applied in practice has faced with new challenges when the Lithuanian courts, which deal with civil cases concerning failure to fulfill the guaranteeing obligations, could not immediately properly form the case law when explaining if the guaranteeing is fixed-term when the agreement of the guarantor with the creditor provides that the guarantor is responsible for the debtor to the creditor till the full implementation of the debtor's obligations to the creditor. In order to draw a proper conclusion as to whether the courts properly form the case law when solving if the guaranteeing is fixed-term when the agreement of the guarantor with the creditor provides that the guarantor is responsible for the debtor to the creditor till the full implementation of the debtor's obligations to the creditor, the Master thesis, in particular, has revealed not the concept of guaranteeing as a way to ensure the obligations in the Lithuanian law, but has looked at the concept in the civil law, the sources, the subject matter and methods, the judge’s situation in the civil law and morality. After that one part of the thesis has been devoted to the analysis of the individual issues related to the guaranteeing, including the main issue relating {{to the role of the}} award of a contract. The thesis has taken into account the problems and the fundamentals of the end of the guaranteeing established in the law in dealing with the issues related to the end of the guaranteeing. The thesis has also looked at the customs established in the Civil Code as the measure for regulation of civil relations. Guarantees are one marketed Collateral measures in favor of both natural and legal persons civilian circulation to take place. Guarantees especially important financially strong enough, but good personal and business reputation with natural or legal persons. In order to bail as a measure to ensure the fulfillment of obligations to be implemented, it is sufficient to persuade the debtor to the creditor the surety of personal reliability and agree on a warranty guarantor. Surety sufficient to realize a simple written form of bailouts for their solidarity is attractive to the creditor, the creditor the surety liable with all its assets. Guarantees by their nature, due to the fact that between the guarantor and the borrower usually there are more than formal relationship, so this fact implies greater and more effective protection of the creditor is marketed. For this reason, the guarantee is one of the most civil circulation occurring in the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> of collateral. It should be noted that most often encountered in the civil circulation, gratuitous bail because, as already mentioned, the debtor and surety commonly linked persons. Surety, by agreeing to answer a debtor gratuitously for the borrower is not met or incorrectly executed obligations to creditors, basically assume all the negative consequences that arise or may arise from the debtor to the creditor are not fulfilled or improperly fulfilled the obligation, but for it does not receive any bonuses. Thus, the guarantor, assuming the obligation to answer the debtor to the creditor, is highly responsible to assess the extent of the guarantee and the deadline. Especially important guarantor is a clear need and knowledge on a warranty period. Research object. The object of research - the essence of CK and norms that define the essence of a surety, fixed-term and indefinite surety end. Research methods. Theoretical study. Applicable logical, systematic analysis, comparative, linguistic methods. Presentation of the study and interpretation will be analyzed in Lithuanian case law development, the courts dealing with the question of whether bail is fixed, if the surety agreement with the creditor provides that the guarantor is responsible for the debtor to the creditor until the full execution debtor's obligations to the creditor, and the case-law consequences. The aim. Taking into account the case law, the surety, which the surety contract agreed with the condition that the guarantee is valid until the full obligations under the main contract execution, the possibility to discuss the warranty expiry, if the debtor sued if it terminated the contract because of his fault, is quite difficult. It can be concluded that the prevailing case law trends are completely useless guarantor, protected only the creditor's rights. The goal - a detailed examination of the surety institute legal regulation, the interpretation and application of the case law, to identify and analyze the surety of legal relations regulation and application and interpretation problems: the guarantee of legal relationship between the identification, separation from other securing obligations institutes and the application together with other institutes issues, guarantor rights of insufficient consolidation and defense issues, as well as the Civil Code, which enshrines the guarantee institution, governing rules and case law interpreting, but also in developing new rules for the guarantee in legal relations, relationship problems surety legal relations in the development and application of the process - to determine whether bail is term, if the surety agreement with the creditor provides that the guarantor is responsible for the debtor to the creditor until the full execution debtor's obligations to the creditor?

40|$|Abstract. It is {{now widely}} {{understood}} {{how to write}} formal specifi-cations {{so as to be}} able to justify designs (and thus implementations) against such specifications. In many formal approaches, a “posit and prove ” approach allows a designer to record an engineering design deci-sion from which a collection <b>of</b> “proof <b>obligations</b> ” are generated; their discharge justifies the design step. Modern theorem proving tools greatly simplify the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> such proof <b>obligations.</b> In typical industrial ap-plications, however, there remain sufficiently many proof obligations that require manual intervention that an engineer finds them a hurdle to the deployment of formal proofs. This problem is exacerbated by the need to repeat proofs when changes are made to specifications or designs.

In its revisions to Article 3, the Act clarifies the requirements for 2 ̆ 2 {{holder in due course}} 2 ̆ 2 status, expands the provisions governing the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> an <b>obligation,</b> reconciles the law regarding liability for signatures on instruments to conform with general agency law, and provides a comparative negligence standard for liability for fraudulent indorsements. The Act also revises the provisions regarding transfer and presentment warranties, reconciles a split in authority regarding conversion of instruments, and clarifies the suretyship defenses. The Act also makes several changes to Article 4 to reflect the increasing automation of the banking industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} mutual {{exclusion}} arises in distributed systems whenever shared resources are concurrently accessed by several sites. For correctness, it is required that shared resource must be accessed {{by a single}} site at a time. To decide, which site execute the critical section next, each site communicate {{with a set of}} other sites. A systematic approach is essential to formulate an accurate speciation. Formal methods are mathematical techniques that provide systematic approach for building and verification of model. We have used Event-B as a formal technique for construction of our model. Event-B is event driven approach which is used to develop formal models of distributed systems. It supports generation and <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> proof <b>obligations</b> arising due to consistency checking. In this paper, we outline a formal construction of model of Lamport's mutual exclusion algorithm for distributed system using Event-B. We have considered vector clock instead of using Lam-port's scalar clock for the purpose of message's time stamping...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We present c-reductions, a simple, {{flexible}} and very general state space reduction technique that exploits an equivalence relation on states {{that is a}} bisimulation. Reduction is achieved by a canonizer function, which maps each state into a not necessarily unique canonical representative of its equivalence class. The approach contains symmetry reduction and name reuse and name abstraction as special cases, and exploits the expressiveness of rewriting logic and its realization in Maude to automate c-reductions and to seamlessly integrate model checking and the <b>discharging</b> <b>of</b> correctness proof <b>obligations.</b> The performance <b>of</b> the approach has been validated over a set of representative case studies. ...|$|R

50|$|Most {{contracts}} are not breached. The {{primary means of}} termination is by due and full and proper performance, which is usually rendered by the person on whom the duty to perform is imposed. The effect of proper performance or payment is to release the party concerned from his contractual obligation. Payment is the delivery of what is owed by a person competent to deliver to a person competent to receive. When made, it operates to <b>discharge</b> the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> the debtor. Proper performance <b>of</b> a party's <b>obligation</b> <b>discharges</b> not only that obligation but also any obligations accessory to it, such as contracts of suretyship and pledge.|$|R
