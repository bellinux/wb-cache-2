5|$|Disruptive {{patterns}} use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes {{to break}} up the outlines of an animal or military vehicle, or to conceal telltale features, especially the eyes, as in the common frog. Disruptive patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as edge detection. Predators like the leopard use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>nightjar</b> use it to avoid detection by predators. Disruptive patterning is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E

50|$|The rich tugay {{vegetation}} provides favourable habitats for birdlife. The {{site was}} classified as an IBA because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as breeding or passage migrants. These include saker falcons, pale-backed pigeons, <b>Egyptian</b> <b>nightjars,</b> European rollers, white-winged woodpeckers, great tits, streaked scrub warblers, Sykes's warblers and red-headed buntings.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>{{nightjar}}</b> (Caprimulgus aegyptius) is a medium-small nightjar {{which occurs}} in south west Asia and north Africa and winters in tropical Africa. This {{is a fairly}} common species with a wide distribution which faces no obvious threats apart from habitat destruction, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
50|$|In nearby Thieves Wood, on 23 June 1883, {{gamekeeper}} Albert Spinks {{shot the}} first example of an <b>Egyptian</b> <b>nightjar</b> in England. He mentioned it to Joseph Whitaker, a naturalist, who recognised it as a rare bird species in Britain. He had the bird stuffed {{and it is now}} kept in a museum in nearby Mansfield. No further examples were seen in Britain until 1984.|$|E
50|$|Over 500 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in Mauritania. Specialities and spectacular species include scissor-tailed kite, Nubian bustard, Arabian bustard, houbara bustard <b>Egyptian</b> plover, golden <b>nightjar,</b> chestnut-bellied starling, Kordofan lark and Sudan golden sparrow.|$|R
50|$|The Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Spotted deer, Sambar deer, wild boar, Nilgai, Chinkara, Civet, Porcupine, Monitor lizard, and 309 {{species of}} birds are found here.

5000|$|The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>nightjar</b> is {{native to}} {{northern}} Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East. Its range includes Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Chad, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Sudan, Sudan, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Yemen. It is a rare visitor to Europe, and has occurred as a vagrant in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Its typical habitat is open desert with a few scattered trees or bushes. It is often found near water in areas with sparse vegetation and scrub. Over-wintering birds in Sudan {{can be found in}} areas with long grass.|$|E

While background matching works best for a single background, disruptive coloration is a more effective strategy when an animal or a military vehicle may have a variety of backgrounds.|$|E
50|$|Whitaker was a naturalist, and {{his home}} at Rainworth Lodge {{looked more like}} a museum, as it was full of cases of stuffed birds and other {{exhibits}} of natural life. One was an <b>Egyptian</b> <b>nightjar,</b> at the time the first known sighting of one in Britain, and only the second in Europe. It had been shot by a gamekeeper called Albert Spinks on 23 June 1883. Spinks knew of Whitaker's interest in birds, and having mentioned it, Whitaker retrieved the bird and had it stuffed. He erected a Bird Stone to commemorate the event in Thieves Wood, to the west of Rainworth, but this was vandalised in the 1980s, and was replaced by a modern artifice. The nightjar, together with many other exhibits, was given to Mansfield Museum on his death. He became an authority on many kinds of wildlife, and especially British birds, although he was not averse to shooting them. On 10 October 1906 he and six others held a shooting party, which gained the record for the biggest bag in Nottinghamshire. The game killed that day included 1,504 partridges.|$|E
