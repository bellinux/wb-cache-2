5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found {{that half of the}} difference between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant women. When taking into account the health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation. Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E

25|$|The tunnel has two cells, {{each with}} two traffic lanes and two footpaths, and a central bore {{for use in}} an {{emergency}} only. Pedestrians and cyclists are expressly forbidden from using the tunnel. The exclusion of cyclists <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> controversial as the feeder road is a dual-carriageway and so is open to cyclists, but the by-law is applied because of space limitations and the obvious danger of cyclists in an enclosed tunnel.|$|E
25|$|These three views—Wilson's non-messianic {{retrospective}} of the Davidic covenant, Brueggemann's sapiential instruction, and Mitchell's eschatologico-messianic programme—all have their followers, although the sapiential agenda <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> eclipsed {{by the other}} two. Shortly before his untimely death in 2005, Wilson modified his position {{to allow for the}} existence of messianic prophecy within the Psalms' redactional agenda. Mitchell's position remains largely unchanged, although he now sees the issue as identifying when the historical beginning of the Psalms turns to eschatology.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} contribution to the decline of Swedish speakers in Finland {{during the second half}} of the 20th century was that many Swedish speakers emigrated to Sweden. An estimated 30% – 50% of all Finnish citizens who moved to Sweden were Swedish-speaking Finns. Reliable statistics are not available, as the Swedish authorities, as opposed to their Finnish counterpart, do not register languages. Another reason is that the natural increase of the Finnish-speakers <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> faster than that of the Swedish-speakers until recent times, when the trend has reversed.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} GHB {{receptor}} in the behavioural effects {{induced by}} GHB is more complex. GHB receptors are densely expressed {{in many areas of}} the brain, including the cortex and hippocampus, and these are the receptors that GHB displays the highest affinity for. There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> limited research into the GHB receptor; however, there is evidence that activation of the GHB receptor in some brain areas results in the release of glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter. Drugs that selectively activate the GHB receptor cause absence seizures in high doses, as do GHB and GABA(B) agonists.|$|E
25|$|Summing up the {{experience}} of African countries both at the national and at the regional levels it is no exaggeration to suggest that, on balance, foreign assistance, especially foreign capitalism, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> deleterious to African development. It must be admitted, however, that the pattern of development is complex and the effect upon it of foreign assistance is still not clearly determined. But the limited evidence available suggests that the forms in which foreign resources have been extended to Africa over the past twenty-five years, insofar as they are concerned with economic development, are, to a great extent, counterproductive.|$|E

25|$|Downtown Shanghai is {{bisected}} by the Huangpu River, {{a man-made}} {{tributary of the}} Yangtze that was created by order of Lord Chunshen during the Warring States period. The historic {{center of the city}} was located on {{the west bank of the}} Huangpu (Puxi), near the mouth of Suzhou Creek, connecting it with Lake Tai and the Grand Canal. The central financial district Lujiazui has grown up on the east bank of the Huangpu (Pudong). The destruction of local wetlands occasioned by the creation of Pudong International Airport along the peninsula's eastern shore <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> offset by the protection and expansion of the nearby shoals of Jiuduansha as a nature preserve.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} years of the 20th century, the city was largely limited to the {{neighbourhood}} now known as the historic city centre (see below), on the mouth of Guanabara Bay. The city's centre of gravity began to shift south and west to the so-called Zona Sul (South Zone) in the early part of the 20th century, when the first tunnel was built under the mountains between Botafogo and the neighbourhood that is now known as Copacabana. Expansion of the city to the north and south was facilitated by the consolidation and electrification of Rio's streetcar transit system after 1905. Botafogo's natural beauty, combined with the fame of the Copacabana Palace Hotel, the luxury hotel of the Americas in the 1930s, helped Rio to gain the reputation it still holds today as a beach party town (although this reputation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> tarnished in recent years by favela violence resulting from the narcotics trade).|$|E
25|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the alvarezsaurs <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> confused, due to different authors using different names for groups {{with the same}} definition. The family Alvarezsauridae was first coined by Jose Bonaparte in 1991, but given no specific phylogenetic definition. Novas later defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Alvarezsaurus and Mononykus plus all its descendants, though others, such as Paul Sereno, used a more inclusive definition, such as all dinosaurs closer to Shuvuuia than to modern birds. In 2009, Livezey and Zusi used the name Alvarezsauroidea for the total group of all alvarezsaurs, restricting the name Alvarezsauridae to the clade defined by Alvarezsaurus + Mononykus. This was followed by Choiniere and colleagues in 2010, who described the first non-alvarezsaurid alvarezsauroid, Haplocheirus. Some authors have used the name Mononykinae for the sub-group of alvarezsaurs including the advanced Mongolian species. However, Choiniere and colleagues argued that Parvicursorinae has priority, since its coordinate name under the ICZN Code, Parvicursoridae, was named earlier.|$|E

The current main vent is {{on the north side}} of the crater by the head of the Drift glacier. Also present on the mountain are Holocene lahar deposits that extend as far as the Cook Inlet. This mountain has produced andesite, basalt and dacite, with relatively silicic andesite dominant in recent eruptions.|$|E

[...] One of these alterations appears to be the side entrance on the southwestern side of the building, Candee hypothesizes that it may have replaced an original window. Another modification appears to have been made to the main entrance which has a flat pedimented front door that is framed with columns protruding on plinths. The main door is also surrounded with [...] "wooden rustification", [...] but it is noted that this alteration to the main entrance [...] "provides an important visual point to the simple building." [...] In 1971, the National Register of Historic Places nomination did not detail the interior, but an included photo noted the windows were boarded up and it was listed as being for rent. A photo from 2013 shows that the structure has since been renovated and remains well-maintained.|$|E
