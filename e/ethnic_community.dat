At the same time, {{the research}} seeks to explore the views of elected representatives on how they see their role in identifying and addressing the concerns and issues of minority <b>ethnic</b> <b>communities.</b> In this context the views of elected representatives/ political parties are examined on a range of different topics and concerns of relevance to minority <b>ethnic</b> <b>communities,</b> including: racist attacks; migration; political representation; voting; and ‘good practice’ (i. e. guidelines and criteria for engaging with minority <b>ethnic</b> <b>communities),</b> amongst others...|$|R

The party's opponents particularly saw its immigration program as a source of claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years downplayed the relevance of the 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding immigration.|$|E

Bumiputras of high and low economic standing are entitled to the same benefits. The statistical problems of categorising wealthy and disadvantaged Bumiputras in one group also meant that the NEP's goal of having 30% of the national wealth held by Bumiputras was not indicative of a median 60% of Bumiputras holding 28% of the national wealth, but could theoretically translate into one Bumiputra holding 29% of the national wealth, with the remaining Bumiputras sharing 1%. Some have alleged that because of this imbalance, some Malays remain economically marginalised. Criticisms also arose from {{the fact that there was}} no planned assistance for Malaysian Chinese and Indian communities to achieve their 40% goal during the actual implementation of the NEP.|$|E
