Repetitive {{stimulation}} of a fibre {{is known to}} result in accumulation of extracellular potassium ions, especially between the axon and the myelin. Uptake of potassium leads to Schwann cell swelling and myelin restructuring that impacts the electrical properties of the myelin. In order to further understand the dynamic interaction that takes place between the myelin and the axon, we have modelled submyelin potassium accumulation and related changes in myelin resistance during prolonged high-frequency stimulation. We predict that potassium-mediated decrease in myelin resistance leads to a functional excitation block with various patterns of altered spike trains.

40|$|The San Pedro River in {{the southwestern}} United States retains a natural flood regime and has several reaches with {{perennial}} stream flow and shallow ground water. However, much of the river flows intermittently. Urbanization-linked declines in regional ground-water levels have raised concerns over the future status of the riverine ecosystem {{in some parts of}} the river, while restoration-linked decreases in agricultural ground-water pumping are expected to increase stream flows in other parts. This study describes the response of the streamside herbaceous vegetation to changes in stream flow permanence. During the early summer dry season, streamside herbaceous cover and species richness declined continuously across spatial gradients of flow permanence, and composition shifted from hydric to mesic species at sites with more intermittent flow. Hydrologic threshold values were evident for one plant functional group: Schoenoplectus acutus, Juncus torreyi, and other hydric riparian plants declined sharply in cover with loss of perennial stream flow. In contrast, cover of mesic riparian perennials (including Cynodon dactylon, an introduced species) increased at sites with intermittent flow. Patterns of hydric and mesic riparian annuals varied by season: in the early summer dry season their cover declined continuously as flow became more intermittent, while in the late summer wet season their cover increased as the flow became more <b>intermittent.</b> <b>Periodic</b> drought at the intermittent sites may increase opportunities for establishment of these annuals during the monsoonal flood season.

The puzzle is to reconcile their relatively smooth zonal motion with the dynamics, as suggested by the morphologies seen in nighttime IR 2 images—the VeGa balloons moved fairly smoothly and zonally at about 6.5 ° away from the equator in the north and south hemispheres over most of their 48 -h trajectory, yet the IR 2 nightside images show a rather chaotic, dynamical situation. The VeGa balloons did at times experience some large vertical accelerations (Blamont et al. 1986), and some were later found to be correlated with topography (Young et al. 1987), while convective overturning is also a possible cause.

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a family of}} chaotic dynamical systems with explicit broad distributions, which always violate the central limit theorem. In particular, we show that the superposition of many statistically independent, identical random variables obeying such chaotic process converge in density to Lévy’s stable laws in {{a full range of}} the index parameters. The theory related to the connection between deterministic chaos and non-Gaussian distributions gives us a systematic view of the purely mechanical generation of Lévy’s stable laws. 1 The central limit theorem (CLT) breaks down when any stationary stochastic process has infinite variance. Thus, it is an important question whether this mathematically pathological situation is physically relevant or not. One noteworthy point arising from recent studies is that such examples of Lévy’s stable laws, which are the most famous class of distributions for violating the CLT, can be seen in many different fields, such as astronomy, physics, biology, economics and communication engineering, under broad conditions [1 – 4]. Thus, it is our primary interest to determine why such Lévy’s stable laws are widely observed, and furthermore, to elucidate the mechanism of generating Lévy’s stable laws. In the 1980 ’s, there were several studies which clarify the relation between <b>intermittent</b> <b>periodic</b> mapping and anomalous diffusion with Lévy’s law-like broad distributions [5, 6]. Random-walk models [7] and combinations of several random number generators [8, 9] are also utilized to generate Lévy’s stable laws.

The purpose of the present paper is to present a systematic method for exact and purely mechanical generation of stable laws with arbitrary indexes only using concrete chaotic dynamical systems.

A high performance network, high throughput, low average delay and low packet loss rate, is highly appreciated to sustain the increasing proliferation in multimedia transmissions. The critical issue reducing the performance of wireless backhaul is the interference occurred in the network due to simultaneous nodes transmissions. In this research, we propose a high performance wireless backhaul using the low interference sensitivity MIMO based nodes. MIMO transmission has a better BER performance over SISO one even with the same transmission rate and bandwidth, which means that MIMO can operate at lower SINR values than SISO and give the same performance. This MIMO robust performance against interference gives us a greater benefit when adopted as a wireless interface in wireless backhaul than SISO. These facts motivated us to use the IEEE 802. 11 n the current MIMO standard to design a MIMO based wireless backhaul. In addition and to justify our assumptions, we investigate the effect of MIMO channels correlation, a major drawback in MIMO transmission, upon the system performance, and prove the robustness of the scheme under different MIMO channels correlation values. After proving the effectiveness of MIMO as a wireless interface for wireless backhaul, we further improve the performance of this MIMO-backhaul using the high efficient <b>Intermittent</b> <b>Periodic</b> Transmit (IPT) forwarding protocol.

Experiments have been carried out to determine quantitatively the response of the trapped saline volume to fresh water flushing discharges Q for different values of the estuary bed slope α and the density difference (∆ρ) o between the saline and fresh water. The trapped saline water forms a wedge within the estuary and for maintained steady discharges, flow visualisation and density profile data confirm that its response to the imposition of the freshwater purging flow occurs in two stages, namely (i) an initial phase characterised by intense shear-induced mixing at the nose of the wedge and (ii) a relatively quiescent second phase where the mixing is significantly reduced and the wedge is forced relatively slowly down and along the bed slope. Scalings based upon simple energy balance considerations are shown to be successful in (i) describing the time-dependent wedge behaviour and (ii) quantifying the proportion of input kinetic energy converted into increasing the potential energy of the wedge/river system. Measurements show that the asymptotic value of the energy conversion factor increases with increasing value of the river Froude number Fr o at small values of Fr o, thereafter reaching a maximum value and a gradual decrease at the highest values of Fr o. Dimensional analysis considerations indicate that the normalised, time-dependent wedge position (x w) 3 (g 2 ̆ 7) o/q 2 can be represented empirically by a power-law relationship of the form (x w) [(g 2 ̆ 7) o /q 2] 1 / 3 =C [(t) [(g 2 ̆ 7) o 2 /q] 1 / 3] "where the proportionality coefficient C is a function of both Fr o and the slope angle α and the exponent n has a value of 0. 24. Successful attempts are made to relate the model data to existing field observations from a microtidal estuary. Experiments with multiple, <b>intermittent</b> <b>periodic</b> flushing flows confirm the importance of the starting phase of each flushing event for the time dependent behaviour of the saline wedge after reaching equilibrium in the intervals between such events.

In a first experiment with an electromagnetic vibrator on earth or in board of Airbus A 300 of CNES, the 1 -ball dynamics exhibit little transverse motion and an <b>intermittent</b> quasi <b>periodic</b> motion along the direction {{parallel to the}} vibration. This behaviour proves a significant reduction of the phase space dimension of this billiard-like system from 11 -d to 3 -d or 1 -d. It is caused by dissipation, which generates non ergodic dynamics.

This eliminates ball rotation and freezes transverse velocity fluctuations. This trends is confirmed by 3 d simulations with JJ Moreau discrete element code. A two-ball experiment performed under zero-g conditions in the Maxus 5 flight confirms the trend; the quasi-periodicity is found much greater, which is probably due to an improvement of experimental conditions.

At any flxed, large enough slope, the system has a one-parameter family of stable steady rolling motions. We flnd analytic approximations for the minimum required slope at a given heading for stable rolling in three dimensions, for the case of many spokes and small slope. The rimless wheel shares some qualitative features with passive-dynamic walking machines; it is a passive three dimensional system with <b>intermittent</b> impacts and <b>periodic</b> motions. In terms of complexity it lies between one dimensional impact oscillators and three dimensional walking machines. In contrast to a rolling disk on a at [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{development}} and variability of soil properties on different landforms of Central Zagros were investigated. The study area covers two climatic regions including Shahrekord and Chellgerd with mean annual precipitations of 314 and 1224 mm, respectively. In Shahrekord area, {{the amount of}} Feo (amorphous and organic-bound iron) was higher in surface horizons, whereas, the Fed (crystalline, amorphous and organic-bound iron) was higher in the surface soil of well-drained pedons and concentrated in subsoils with high ground water. Smectite increases as chlorite and palygorskite decrease. This might be an indication of Fe-chlorite transformation {{as a result of}} the local effects of organic acids, alternate oxidation reduction and hydrolysis intensity of a wetter past climate. Presence of an argillic as well as petrocalcic horizon with sparitic calcite and spherulitic fabric show <b>intermittent</b> and <b>periodic</b> leaching and deposition in Shahrekord area. Furthermore, reduction in sand and gravel content of the soils from mountain toward plains was attributed to the dissolution of carbonates and deposition of alluvium. Lower pH, lower carbonate content and higher pedogenic Fe in surface horizons were prominent in Chellgerd area. Consequently, interstratified chlorite-smectite, decrease of Fe-chlorite in fine clay, increase of smectite, high CEC and absence of petrocalcic horizon show that weathering intensity was higher in Chellgerd as compared to Shahrekord area. Also, papules with concentric fabric, higher Fed-Feo, and redder hues in buried horizon suggest polygenetic soils. There was some evidence of climatic change in two areas; however, time seems to have played an important role in Shahrekord, whereas topography must have been more effective in Chellgerdarea due to higher tectonic activities and unstable landforms which may confirm the formation of the buried horizon and paleosols...|$|R
