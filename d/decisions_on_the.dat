5|$|As {{early as}} 1815, Bute had his Glamorgan estates fully surveyed, which {{highlighted}} that the estates had been neglected {{for many years}} and were now in a poor condition. Edward Richards became the senior official in charge of the estates by 1824 and represented Bute on both estate and political affairs across the region. Despite this, Bute retained the final authority over even quite minor issues on the estates, including making <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> buttons to be used on local school uniforms or the reuse of a broken flag pole, for example, which could result in considerable delays as letters were sent between South Wales and Scotland. As the complexity of the Glamorgan estates grew, more officials were appointed to help manage the docks, farms and mineral interests, but these all reported separately to Bute, putting increasing pressure on the marquess.|$|E
5|$|Before Lucas {{had started}} writing, his {{producing}} partner Rick McCallum {{was preparing for}} the film.

In April 1994, McCallum started searching for artists in art, architecture and design schools, and in mid-year he began location scouting with production designer Gavin Bocquet. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) art director Doug Chiang impressed McCallum the most and was hired as the design director.|$|E

5|$|In September 1942, Groves {{took charge}} of the Manhattan Project. He was {{involved}} in most aspects of the atomic bomb's development. He participated in the selection of sites for research and production at Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Los Alamos, New Mexico; and Hanford, Washington. He directed the enormous construction effort, made critical <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> various methods of isotope separation, acquired raw materials, directed the collection of military intelligence on the German nuclear energy project and helped select the cities in Japan that were chosen as targets. Groves wrapped the Manhattan Project in security but failed to prevent the Soviet Union from conducting a successful espionage program that stole some of its most important secrets.|$|E
5|$|In Yong Vui Kong v.

5|$|In theory, the emperor's {{political}} power was absolute, but {{even during the}} Han dynasty, he shared executive powers with civilian officials and normally based his <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> advice and formal consensus of his ministers. During the Song dynasty, a national examination system (Civil Service Exam) managed by scholar-bureaucrats was used to recruit officials; those who passed the palace examination – the highest-level examination in the empire – were appointed directly by the emperor to the highest central government positions. Like commoners, these senior officials had to obey his edicts as law or be punished. However, senior officials not only challenged the emperor over policy, but restrained him by invoking the ideal Confucian mores {{and values of the}} literati gentry class from which they came.|$|E

5|$|PortLINK is {{the most}} complex of the proposals, as it {{involves}} making <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> future of the Outer Harbor and Grange railway lines. The report proposes several different options for these lines. They could be electrified but remain as heavy rail, or they could be converted to light rail - with potential spurlines added to West Lakes and Semaphore. Light rail options for the Grange railway line include converting the entire line to light rail, diverting it to West Lakes and closing the section beyond Albert Park station, or replacing it with new on-street routes to Grange and West Lakes. The PortLINK routes {{are very similar to}} a group of light rail extensions to West Lakes, Port Adelaide and Semaphore that were announced in the 2008 South Australian Budget but then scrapped in the 2012 budget.|$|E
5|$|While {{the largely}} {{underground}} southern section will reach Ny Ellebjerg station from The Central Station by 2023. South of the Central Station will four new stations be built before the line terminus at Ny Ellebjerg. Three {{of these four}} stations will pass through the southern parts of Copenhagen's harbour. The northern terminus will presumably be moved farther and farther out at the peninsula, which constitutes {{a large part of}} Copenhagen's northern harbour part, as the city aims to rebuild typical harbour buildings with housing. However the political <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> M4 topic, so far only deals with a line with a total of 13 stations between Orientkaj and Ny Ellebjerg. In the end of 2019 will there be 4 Metro lines and 39 stations within the Copenhagen Metro system. And by 2023 will the Metro still comprises 4 lines, but 44 stations will be served instead of 39. Of the 44 stations in 2023, will 8 stations serve both Metro as well as S-train.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the new defences was {{probably}} carried out by Rogers and resembled his earlier work near Calais, although the King probably also made some <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> project personally. Sir Richard Long and Michael Stanhope were instructed to oversee {{the construction of the}} defences, with Thomas Aldred acting as the project's paymaster and William Reynolds in the role of master mason. Initial estimates suggested that 530 workers would be needed, including masons, carpenters and plumbers, but more may have been required in practice. Some of the building materials were taken from monastic institutions, which had recently dissolved by Henry; stone and lead was taken from the nearby Meaux Abbey, further stone from the friaries in Hull and probably also from St Mary's Church in Hull, which had recently collapsed. At least some of the bricks needed were made in a series of ten kilns beside the site itself. The land needed for the buildings had been seized during the dissolution of the monasteries. By December 1543, £21,056 had been spent on the project.|$|E
