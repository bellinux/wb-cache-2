5|$|Nutrition plays a {{major role}} in and individual’s overall health; {{psychological}} and physical <b>health</b> <b>status</b> is often dramatically impacted by the presence of malnutrition. India currently has one of the highest rates of malnourished women among developing countries. A study in 2000 found that nearly 70 percent of non-pregnant women and 75 percent of pregnant women were anemic in terms of iron-deficiency. One of the main drivers of malnutrition is gender specific selection of the distribution of food resources.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{presents}} two spectrophotometric {{absorption bands}} peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760nm. Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using {{the measurement of}} the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant <b>health</b> <b>status</b> from a satellite platform. This approach exploits {{the fact that in}} those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.|$|E
5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair is a sign of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Building on an {{emerging}} scientific {{consensus that the}} concept of child health should encompass chronic conditions, functional abilities, and developmental domains, we delineate the multidimensional <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> of Mexican, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic white preschool children in the United States. This integrative approach provides the foundation for an in-depth analysis of health disparities. OBJECTIVE The research objectives are: (1) to demonstrate a new methodological approach to identifying the major child health statuses; (2) to document differences in the prevalence of those <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> among children in the largest ethnoracial groups in the U. S.; and (3) to assess whether key sources of disadvantage account for ethnoracial disparities in children's health. METHODS With data from a nationally representative sample, we use latent class analysis to estimate a set of latent <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> that capture the nature of health at age four. The latent class membership of children is predicted using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS Mexican and non-Hispanic black children are more likely than non-Hispanic white children to fall into <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> distinguished by low cognitive achievement and multiple developmental problems. Mexican children are the most likely to be classified into these problematic <b>health</b> <b>statuses.</b> This pattern persists in multivariate models that incorporate potential explanatory factors, including health at birth, socio-demographic characteristics, home environment, well-child care and center-based child care. CONCLUSIONS Latent class analysis is a useful method for incorporating measures of physical conditions, functional problems, and development into a single analysis in order to identify key dimensions of childhood health and locate ethnoracial health disparities...|$|R

5|$|The {{worst of}} Linda's impact was in Vietnam, where 3,111 people were killed, and damage totaled $385 million (USD). Heavy {{rainfall}} caused flooding, which {{damaged or destroyed}} about 200,000 houses and left about 383,000 people homeless. Widespread crop and transportation damage also occurred, the latter which impeded relief efforts. Several {{countries around the world}} sent relief aid, including medical teams, food, and clothing. However, the food supply and <b>health</b> <b>status</b> of the storm victims proved not as bad as originally feared. Linda later struck Thailand, causing flash flooding and at least 164 deaths. The storm also affected Burma (Myanmar), Indonesia, Malaysia, and Cambodia to a lesser degree.|$|E
5|$|Vladimir Lenin {{was voted}} the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR (Sovnarkom) on 30 December 1922 by the Congress of Soviets. His health, {{at the age}} of 53, {{declined}} from effects of two bullet wounds, later aggravated by three strokes which culminated with his death in 1924. Irrespective of his <b>health</b> <b>status</b> in his final days, Lenin was already losing much of his power to Stalin. Alexei Rykov succeeded Lenin as Chairman of the Sovnarkom, and although he was de jure the most powerful person in the country, the Politburo of the Communist Party began to overshadow the Sovnarkom in the mid-1920s. By the end of the decade, Rykov merely rubber stamped the decisions predetermined by Stalin and the Politburo.|$|E
25|$|Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) using German Socio-Economic Panel and hazard model {{find that}} Socio-demographic {{factors such as}} health and gender have a strong impact on the {{retirement}} decision: women tend to retire earlier than men, and poor health makes people go into retirement, {{particularly in the case}} of disability retirement. The relationship between <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and retirement is significant for both self-assessed and objective indicators of <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> This is similar finding to the previous research of Blau and Riphahn (1997); using individual data from the German Socio-Economic Panel as well, but controlling for different variables they found that if individual has chronic health condition, then he tends to retire. Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) use better measure for <b>health</b> <b>status</b> than Blau and Riphahn (1997), because self-assessed and objective indicators of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> are better measures than chronic health condition.|$|E

40|$|Background: Between {{the school}} years of 2009 - 2012, the {{turnover}} {{record of the}} University of San Jose-Recoletos (USJ-R), Cebu City, Philippines showed that permanent faculty members who left the institution were all midlifers. Their reasons varied from health issues to greener pasture elsewhere. Materials and Methods: This study then sought to explore the <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> of the faculty midlifers of the USJ-R. The data were collected through survey conducted among the 106 faculty midlifers of the university. This study applied multivariate analyses to the survey data using Pearson-moment of correlation to determine {{the relationship between the}} sociodemographic profile of the research participants and their <b>health</b> <b>statuses.</b> Results: This research revealed that faculty midlifers are generally well physically. They showed emotional maturity and have positive outlook toward midlife. More so, their health conditions are significantly related with their sex, age, years of teaching, educational attainment, and income. Conclusion: At midlife, the faculty members of USJ-R can still generally be considered physically well. Thus, if they are well-managed, they can become relevant and better contributors to the attainment of the basic goals and objectives of the educational institution and the educational system in general...|$|R

25|$|Current {{criminal}} legislation {{does not}} provide for special penalties for acts that target another by reason of his sexual orientation, age or <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Only the constituent elements of the criminal offense of Incitement to hatred towards a group of persons or to the curtailment of their rights and freedoms, and general aggravating circumstances include attacking a so-called different group of people. Such {{a group of people}} can then, of course, be also one defined by sexual orientation, age or <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> A certain disparity has thus been created between, on the one hand, those groups of people who are victimized by reason of their skin color, faith, nationality, ethnicity or political persuasion and enjoy increased protection, and, on the other hand, those groups that are victimized by reason of their sexual orientation, age or <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and are not granted increased protection. This gap in protection against attacks motivated by the victim's sexual orientation, age or <b>health</b> <b>status</b> cannot be successfully bridged by interpretation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was {{to examine the relationship between}} psychological distress and aspects of <b>health</b> insurance <b>status,</b> including lack of coverage, types of coverage and disruption in coverage, among US adults. Data from the 2001 - 2010 National Health Interview Survey were used to conduct analyses representative of the US adult population aged 18 - 64 years. Multivariate analyses regressed psychological distress on <b>health</b> insurance <b>status</b> while controlling for covariates. Adults with private or no health insurance coverage had lower levels of psychological distress than those with public/other coverage. Adults who recently (22 ̆ 0304122 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 year) experienced a change in <b>health</b> insurance <b>status</b> had higher levels of distress than those who had not recently experienced a change. An interaction effect indicated that the relationship between recent change in <b>health</b> insurance <b>status</b> and distress was not dependent on whether an adult had private versus public/other coverage. However, for adults who had not experienced a change in status in the past year, the average absolute level of distress is higher among those with no coverage versus private coverage. Although significant relationships between psychological distress and <b>health</b> insurance <b>status</b> were identified, their strength was modest, with other demographic and health condition covariates also being potential sources of distress.

25|$|Quinn et al. (1998) find {{significant}} correlation between <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and retirement status. They transform answers for question about <b>health</b> <b>status</b> from five levels (“excellent”, “very good”, “good”, “fair” and “poor”) into three levels and report results for three groups of people. 85% of respondents who answered “excellent” or “very good” to the question about their health in 1992 were still working two years after this interview, compared to 82% of those who answered “good”, and 70% of those answered “fair” or “poor”.
