She also has several piercings, including a 'Monroe' (a piercing near the upper lip that resembles a beauty mark) and 'Snakebites' (a piercing {{on each side of the}} lower lip).|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} French frigates closed-up {{for mutual}} protection. At 10:00, Monarch engaged Minerve and Armide, {{as the weather}} prevented Monarch from opening <b>her</b> <b>lower</b> gun ports, she was badly mauled. An hour later, Centaur caught up and began firing at Armide and Gloire, leaving Monarch to continue her fight with Minerve. Armide struck to Centaur at 11:45 and Minerve surrendered to Monarch shortly after. Gloire veered west {{in an attempt to}} throw her pursuers but Centaur and Mars chased her down and forced her to strike at 15:00.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} given a more {{extensive}} refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted anti-aircraft guns on <b>her</b> <b>lower</b> flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, {{and gave her a}} small island on the starboard side. Furious resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939. As a deck-landing training carrier in 1939 Furious embarked 767 Squadron, flying Shark, Swordfish and Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft, and 769 Squadron, flying Blackburn Skua, Blackburn Roc, and Gloster Sea Gladiator fighters.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} that summer, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that she was too frail to hold her birthday reception for the public, an annual tradition dating {{back to the days of}} the monarchy. As one of her last public appearances in September, she officially became a member of the American Red Cross. Following several months of deteriorating health that left her without the use of <b>her</b> <b>lower</b> limbs, as well as a diminished mental capacity rendering her incapable of recognizing her own house, her inner circle of friends and caregivers sat vigil for the last two weeks of her life knowing the end was near. In accordance with Hawaiian tradition, the royal kāhili fanned her as she lay in bed. On the morning of November 11, Liliʻuokalani died at the age of seventy-nine at her residence at Washington Place.|$|E
5|$|Furious was recommissioned in May 1932 {{as part of}} the Home Fleet with {{a reduced}} crew before being brought up to full {{complement}} in November. Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the Mediterranean Fleet from May to October 1934. Furious was present at the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for King George VI. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport, where the forward end of <b>her</b> <b>lower</b> flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the Munich Crisis in September 1938, she embarked Nos. 801, 821 and 822 Squadrons and joined the fleet at Scapa Flow, before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943 Graf Zeppelin {{was again}} towed eastward, first to Gotenhafen, {{then to the}} {{roadstead}} at Swinemünde and finally berthed at a back-water wharf in the Parnitz River, two miles (3km) from Stettin, {{where she had been}} briefly docked in 1941. There she languished {{for the next two years}} with only a 40-man custodial crew in attendance. When Red Army forces neared the city in April 1945, the ship's Kingston valves were opened, flooding <b>her</b> <b>lower</b> spaces and settling her firmly into the mud in shallow water. A ten-man engineering squad then rigged the vessel's interior with demolition and depth charges in order to hole the hull and destroy vital machinery. At 6pm on 25 April 1945, just as the Soviets entered Stettin, commander Wolfgang Kähler radioed the squad to detonate the explosives. Smoke billowing from the carrier's funnel confirmed the charges had gone off, rendering the ship useless to her new owners for many months to come.|$|E
60|$|Leaning {{back against}} the rough stone wall of the cottage, she seemed to bask languidly {{in the warmth of}} the rosy flush. Only <b>her</b> <b>lowered</b> eyes glanced at her little feet.|$|R

60|$|Blanche {{kept her}} hand behind her head, which was bent {{slightly}} forward; her bare arm emerged from her hanging sleeve, and, {{with her eyes}} glancing upward from under <b>her</b> <b>lowered</b> brows, she smiled at her two spectators. Her husband laid his hand on Bernard's arm.|$|R
5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of <b>her</b> <b>lower</b> neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E
5|$|During Shepherd's surgery, {{his hand}} becomes numb, and he frustratedly exits the {{operating}} room. In the intern appendectomy, Wilson {{makes a mistake}} and freezes, leading to a scolding from Meredith Grey. Back in Minnesota, Yang is annoyed by the peppy attitudes of her superiors at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Craig Thomas (William Daniels) and Dr. Parker (Steven Culp), so she decides to take a trip to Seattle for Sloan's death. However, her PTSD hinders her from boarding the plane, and she ultimately remains in Minnesota. Meanwhile, Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), now a plastic surgical fellow, sits by Sloan's bedside and talks of medical cases to him. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) enters Sloan's hospital room and removes him from life support. Unable to cope with Sloan's death, Meredith Grey boards a plane to visit Yang, but panics before it takes off. Shortly thereafter, Meredith Grey finds Karev at the airport bar, where he reveals {{that he will be}} staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital. The next morning, Hunt visits Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) at her family's farm, and asks her to begin working in Seattle again. At the conclusion of the episode, Torres returns home to Robbins, who is revealed to have had <b>her</b> <b>lower</b> left leg amputated {{as a result of the}} crash.|$|E

5000|$|Price {{had been}} {{attempting}} {{to sell the}} restaurant and retire since 2009, initially setting the value at $1.5 million. As of late 2010, the difficult real estate market had forced <b>her</b> to <b>lower</b> <b>her</b> asking price.|$|R
60|$|Octavia cast one {{of those}} subtle, sidelong glances toward him from beneath <b>her</b> <b>lowered</b> eyelids--a glance that Teddy used to {{describe}} as an upper-cut. But {{there was nothing in}} his ingenuous, weather-tanned face to warrant a suspicion that he was making an allusion--nothing. Beyond a doubt, thought Octavia, he had forgotten.|$|R
50|$|Tetsuzan {{then has}} her {{suspended}} over a well and, erotically enjoying her torture, has <b>her</b> <b>lowered</b> {{into the well}} several times, beating her himself when she is raised.

25|$|Radcliffe took a {{break through}} the 2006 season owing to {{injuries}} and in July announced that she was expecting her first child. Her comeback was further delayed in 2007 {{as a result of}} a stress fracture in <b>her</b> <b>lower</b> back.|$|E

25|$|The {{weight of}} Taihos armor {{immersed}} her hull so deeply that <b>her</b> <b>lower</b> hangar deck was barely above the load waterline and {{the bottoms of}} her two elevator wells (which formed the roofs of her fore and aft aviation fuel tanks) were actually below the waterline. This latter fact would {{play an important role}} in her subsequent destruction during the Battle of the Philippine Sea.|$|E
25|$|Holland was {{reported}} missing from her house in Goodna on 23 September 1991; she had been {{on her way to}} nearby shops.
