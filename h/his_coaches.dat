5|$|Tavares {{has been}} praised by <b>his</b> <b>coaches</b> {{for his ability}} to {{anticipate}} the play since he joined the OHL. A lack of speed had been the most common criticism of Tavares' play, something he spent his junior career attempting to improve. Tavares' skating speed is something he greatly improved since turning professional, and his speed is no longer considered an issue on the ice.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} put up for sale in summer 2010, and Allardyce was offered the job of {{managing}} Al-Ahli Dubai, but could not secure permission to leave Blackburn without paying compensation to the club and so remained in charge at Ewood Park. Allardyce was later sacked by new owners the Venky's on 13 December 2010, with Rovers placed 13th in the league. He was replaced by one of <b>his</b> <b>coaches,</b> Steve Kean, whose agent Jerome Anderson was a highly influential figure with the Venky family.|$|E
50|$|Although {{initially}} {{not interested}} in pair skating, he made the switch on <b>his</b> <b>coach's</b> advice when he was 16. <b>His</b> <b>coach,</b> Natalia Golubeva, paired him with Maria Chashina, who was also switching from singles.|$|R
50|$|He began <b>his</b> <b>coaching</b> spell at St.Mirren as a player-coach {{in a brief}} spell {{before losing}} <b>his</b> <b>coaching</b> duties. This career was resurrected when he was named {{assistant}} manager at Alloa Athletic before his current role.|$|R
5|$|In November, Murray {{split with}} <b>his</b> <b>coach</b> Brad Gilbert {{and added a}} team of experts along with Miles Maclagan, <b>his</b> main <b>coach.</b>|$|R
5|$|Because of this, he {{was later}} moved to a {{deep-lying}} playmaker role by <b>his</b> <b>coaches</b> Mazzone, Fatih Terim, and Ancelotti, where {{he was able to}} excel due to his unique capabilities. This position best utilised Pirlo's attributes, and allowed him to operate creatively from a deeper position, in or even behind the main midfield line, in a seemingly defensive midfield role, where he was allowed more time on the ball to create scoring opportunities with his trademark long balls. During his final season with Milan, Pirlo was also used on the wing under Allegri, due to his ability to provide accurate crosses.|$|E
5|$|For his {{performance}} in the 1924 Rose Bowl, Navy quarterback Ira McKee was awarded Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors. McKee completed 16 of 20 passes {{for a total of}} 175 yards, including one pass for a touchdown. McKee also had 85rushing yards on twelve attempts. Washington running back Elmer Tesreau was given the game's Ironman Award, though he had little effect on the game. Against the urging of <b>his</b> <b>coaches,</b> Tesreau had played with boils completely covering one knee. He left {{near the end of the}} game, and was later discovered to have broken his previously unaffected leg in multiple places.|$|E
5|$|Hull {{accepted}} {{a scholarship to}} play for the University of Minnesota-Duluth (UMD), and in 1984–85, scored 32 goals as a freshman. The power of his shot terrorized opposition goaltenders. He was awarded the Jerry Chumola Award as the school's rookie of the year and received similar honors from the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). <b>His</b> <b>coaches</b> at Minnesota-Duluth impressed on Hull the need to improve his skating, and in 1985–86, he broke the school record of 49 goals in one season, reaching 52 for the campaign. Hull was named the WCHA first team all-star at right wing and was a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award as the top player in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).|$|E

5|$|Mario Eduardo Lemus Hollands (born August 26, 1988) is an American {{professional}} baseball pitcher {{who is currently}} a free agent. He played college baseball for the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos, where he {{earned a degree in}} sociology. The Phillies drafted him in the 2010 MLB Draft, and after a few seasons in the farm system, they invited him to spring training in 2014. After performing well in those exhibition games, he made the Phillies' 2014 Opening Day roster, and although he walked too many hitters, showed some potential to emerge as a decent relief pitcher. His teammates described him as a good personality to have in the bullpen, and <b>his</b> <b>coaches</b> approved of his development. Meanwhile, he is pursuing another college degree; he is studying merchandise marketing at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising.|$|E
5|$|On March 18, 2003, Owumi {{signed a}} letter of intent to play college {{football}} for Georgetown. He joined the team on a scholarship under head coach Bob Benson, uncertain of his future in basketball. Although Owumi had initially desired to play the quarterback position, <b>his</b> <b>coaches</b> wanted him to play wide receiver due to his athletic abilities. He later moved to being a safety and eventually became the Hoyas' third-string quarterback, {{but he would not}} officially play the position. Following the football season, Owumi often practiced with the school's basketball team but never joined. He decided to transfer out of Georgetown to focus on academics and basketball, retaining his four years of college basketball eligibility.|$|E
5|$|Overhauling {{the team}} {{during his first}} year at Liverpool, Shankly {{released}} 24 players and converted a boot storage room into a meeting place where he and <b>his</b> <b>coaches</b> discussed strategy. They won the 1961–62 Second Division title and were promoted to the First Division. Two seasons later, Liverpool won their first League title since 1946–47, thereby qualifying for Liverpool's first participation in UEFA competition. The following season, Liverpool won their first FA Cup. Further League titles followed in 1965–66 and 1972–73. 1973 brought their first European trophy, the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. The following season, Shankly's last, they won the FA Cup again.|$|E

5|$|Parseghian also {{recognized}} talent in quarterback John Huarte {{and wide receiver}} Jack Snow, who had been used only sparingly for two seasons by previous coaches. Huarte could throw far and accurately but was soft-spoken, a trait Parseghian and his staff helped change. Snow was large for a receiver of his era, but Parseghian thought his athleticism and sure hands would make him a good wideout. Still, expectations were muted for the 1964 season: Parseghian told <b>his</b> <b>coaches</b> that the team would have a 6–4 record if they were lucky. Sports Illustrated predicted a 5–5 record at best, and the team did not rank among the top 20 programs {{in the country in}} the pre-season AP Poll.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Huskies had outscored {{their opponents}} 20337 {{during the regular}} season, {{excluding}} the games against New York and Mississippi. Washington's running backs, George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau, led their offense during the season, each gaining several hundred rushing yards. However, Tesreau was suffering from boils on his knee, and <b>his</b> <b>coaches</b> urged him to not play in the Rose Bowl. The Washington defense was considered superior to that of Navy, being much larger on average. Washington's defense had been very effective during the regular season, holding five teams scoreless and allowing more than ten points to be scored against them only once. Washington's special teams {{were considered to be}} average.|$|E
5|$|In the 400m {{freestyle}} heats, Windle and Talbot made a misjudgement; in {{an attempt}} to conserve his energy for the final they decided that Windle should not go flat out, and Windle was four seconds slower than he was at the Australian Championships. Windle was one of the top seeds for the race, and Talbot advised him to swim hard {{in the first half of}} the race before slowing down. However, he swam too slowly and missed the final completely. Although he won his heat by seven seconds in a time of 4min 21.6s, he was the ninth fastest overall, so he missed the final by one position with a time deficit of 0.5s. The slowest qualifier was Tsuyoshi Yamanaka, who had been prevented from withdrawing from the race by <b>his</b> <b>coaches.</b> On the other hand, the two other Australian representatives who he defeated at the national championships did make the final, including Wood, who went on to win bronze. Talbot said that the tactical error was mostly his responsibility and that he learnt a lot from it.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Raonic again led the ATP {{in points}} won on first serve (82%) and in service games won (91%). He had 45 match {{victories}} {{for the second}} consecutive year. <b>His</b> <b>coaching</b> team underwent significant changes in 2013. In May, Raonic split with <b>his</b> <b>coach</b> of two and half years, Blanco. Less than a month later, Raonic hired former world No. 3 tennis player Ivan Ljubičić as <b>his</b> <b>coach.</b> In December, he hired Riccardo Piatti as a co-coach with Ljubičić.|$|R

5|$|An {{offensive}}ly-minded defenceman, Niedermayer {{was best}} known for his skating ability and drew comparison's to the game's offensive greats from the time he broke into the NHL. He was compared to Paul Coffey for his ability to take the puck from his own goal line and convert a defensive situation into an offensive rush. He often chafed at playing within the Devils' defence-oriented system, feeling it restricted his offensive creativity, but also admitted that he learned to place greater emphasis on his defence and develop his overall game. Niedermayer earned a reputation for inconsistency early in his career. He often played his best games against top opposition, but his failure to consistently apply his skills against all opposition occasionally frustrated his teammates and left <b>his</b> <b>coaches</b> lamenting that he was a player capable of being dominant but often was not. By {{the end of his career}} however, and following his Norris Trophy win in 2004, Niedermayer was regarded as one of the top offensive defencemen of his generation and as one of the game's greatest winners. Niedermayer and former Ducks teammate Corey Perry are the only players in hockey history to win every major contemporary North American and International Competitive titles: the Memorial Cup, World Junior championship, Stanley Cup, World Championship, World Cup and Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Greene won {{his second}} AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award after the 1974 season, {{becoming}} {{the first player to}} receive the award multiple times. That year, he developed a new tactic of lining up at a sharp angle between the guard and center to disrupt the opposition's blocking assignments. <b>His</b> <b>coaches</b> were at first skeptical of the tactic and did not allow him to try it during the regular season. He first implemented it against the Buffalo Bills in the division championship game. It proved to be highly effective, as it impeded Buffalo's blocking, and running back O. J. Simpson managed only 48 yards rushing. The following week, the Steelers faced the Oakland Raiders in the AFC championship game, with the defining match-up being Greene against All-Pro center Jim Otto. At one point Greene, consumed by emotions, kicked Otto in the groin. Later, on a third-down play, Greene threw Otto to the ground with one arm before leaping to sack quarterback Ken Stabler. Oakland was held to 29 rushing yards in the Steelers' 24–13 victory. On January 12, 1975, the Steelers won their first of four Super Bowl championships in a six-year span by defeating the Minnesota Vikings 16–6 in Super Bowl IX. In that game, lined up against center Mick Tingelhoff, Greene recorded an interception, forced fumble, and fumble recovery in what {{is considered one of the}} greatest individual defensive Super Bowl performances. Pittsburgh limited the Vikings to only 119 total yards of offense, 17 of which were gained on the ground. After the season, Greene was honored by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at its 39th Dapper Dan dinner as Pittsburgh's outstanding sports figure of the year.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December 1959, Bill Shankly was {{appointed}} manager, beginning a fifteen-year spell as manager that brought three league titles, two FA Cups and a first European trophy, the UEFA Cup to Anfield. Shankly's reign as manager {{is famous for}} the establishment of the Anfield boot room as the location for his tactical discussions with <b>his</b> <b>coaches.</b> When he was not managing the club, Shankly was usually at his typewriter, personally replying to the letters which arrived at Melwood. Shankly even called some supporters at home to discuss the previous day's game, while the accounts of him providing tickets for fans are endless. When Shankly retired in 1974, he was replaced by his assistant, Bob Paisley. During the next nine seasons, Paisley proceeded to win six league titles and three European Cups to become the most successful manager {{in the history of the}} club. When Paisley retired in 1983, his assistant Joe Fagan took over, and continued the Boot Room tradition, and winning a treble of League, European Cup and League Cup in his first season. He again guided Liverpool to a European Cup Final, but the match was overshadowed by the Heysel stadium disaster, and he retired soon after. Striker Kenny Dalglish was then made the club's first player-manager and in his first season in charge, Dalglish led the club to a League and FA Cup double. After that great first season, Dalglish led Liverpool to a further two league titles and another FA Cup. However, the Hillsborough disaster overshadowed his reign; it was one of the reasons for Dalglish resigning on 22 February 1991.|$|E
