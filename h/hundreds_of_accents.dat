The purpose is to assess the principles applied in various lexicographic works in the representation <b>of</b> Vedic <b>accents</b> {{and its relation to}} the underlying linguistic category as well as traditions <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> marking in different texts. Since the focus is on Sanskrit lexicography, we ignore the complexity <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> marking in manuscripts and the diversity <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> marking across different Indic scripts that were used to write Sanskrit over the ages.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} the morphological influences on stress and pitch accent. Two basic types are identified. The first concerns Accent Resolution, the deletion <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> in words {{with more than one}} inherently accented morpheme. This deletion pattern is often ‘root-controlled’ in that it shows a preference for retaining the <b>accent</b> <b>of</b> the root, which underscores one important role for the morphology. The second influence is from affixes that idiosyncratically trigger one of several stem mutations: deletion <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> (or a ‘dominance effect’), insertion <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> (AKA ‘pre- and post-accentuation’), and shifts and retractions <b>of</b> <b>accent.</b> These affix-controlled processes are also morphological in that they are predicated on the application of a morphological process; in essence, they are accentual stem-formation rules. A fundamental goal of this work is to explain the properties of these morpho-accentual phenomena with assumptions that are generally available in linguistic theory. This guiding principle is of inherent value, because it means that the analyses it produces are not limited to a specific theory <b>of</b> <b>accent,</b> a problem that has plagued much previous work. Moreover, there are abundant parallels between accentual and non-accentual morpho-phonology, and these parallels demand an explanation. For example, the characterization <b>of</b> <b>Accent</b> Resolution as root-controlle...|$|R

He observes that the words complete, extreme, serene, and sublime occur twenty-four times in Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, and Samson Agonistes, and in each case the accent is on the second syllable, whereas each of these words appears only once in Comus and there 'suffers' recession <b>of</b> <b>accent.</b>|$|R

Despite {{the frequency with which}} we encounter such accents, the neural mechanisms supporting successful perception <b>of</b> <b>accented</b> speech are poorly understood. Nonetheless, candidate neural substrates involved in processing speech in challenging listening conditions, including accented speech, are beginning to be identified.

40|$|The present review {{seeks to}} bridge {{research}} on accents, stigma, and communication {{by examining the}} empirical literature on nonnative accents, considering the perspectives of both speakers and listeners. The authors suggest that an accent, or one’s manner of pronunciation, differs from other types of stigma. They consider the role of communicative processes {{in the manner in}} which accents influence people and identify social and contextual factors related to accents that affect the speaker, the listener, and the interaction between them. The authors propose a framework <b>of</b> stigma <b>of</b> <b>accents</b> and possible future avenues of research to examine the social psychological and communicative effects <b>of</b> <b>accents.</b> They also discuss implications for stigma of other types <b>of</b> <b>accents</b> (e. g., other native, regional, and ethnic). Understanding how stigma <b>of</b> <b>accents</b> and communication affect each other provides a new theoretical approach to studying this type of stigma and can eventually lead to interventions...|$|R
30|$|Variability <b>of</b> speaker <b>accent</b> is a {{challenge}} for effective human communication as well as speech technology including automatic speech recognition and accent identification. The motivation {{of this study is}} to contribute to a deeper understanding <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> variation across speakers from a cognitive perspective. The goal is to provide perceptual assessment <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> variation in native and English. The main focus is to investigate how listener's accent background affects accent perception and comprehensibility. The results from perceptual experiments show that the listeners' accent background impacts their ability to categorize accents. Speaker accent type affects perceptual accent classification. The interaction between listener accent background and speaker accent type is significant for both accent perception and speech comprehension. In addition, the results indicate that the comprehensibility of the speech contributes to accent perception. The outcomes point to the complex nature <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> perception, and provide a foundation for further investigation on the involvement of cognitive processing for accent perception. These findings contribute to a richer understanding of the cognitive aspects <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> variation, and its application for speech technology.|$|R

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> [pronunciation <b>of</b> speech sounds {{determined}} by a speaker’s regional or national location] on auditory speech comprehension has been well documented, but research is lacking as to its effects on visual speech understanding. In order to address this, the present study examined the effect <b>of</b> regional <b>accent</b> variation on speechreading performance. The aim {{was to determine if}} familiarity with an accent would prove to be an advantage when speechreading, and if certain regional accents would be associated with a greater clarity of visual signal than others. The study examined both the identification <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> based on visual or auditory sentences and the effect <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> variation on auditory and visual speech comprehension. Of particular interest was the effect <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> on speechreading accuracy. The two British accents chosen for comparison were Nottingham and Glaswegian. Results showed that accent discrimination is possible using only visual speech. Greater accuracy was achieved when participants differentiated between the accents based on auditory sentences, but with visual speech, performance was also greater than chance [p. >. 05]. This suggests that the two accents have sufficiently distinct patterns of visual articulation and auditory pronunciation to allow participants to discriminate between them. Further, the participants visual and auditory speech recognition scores were adversely affected by the use <b>of</b> an unfamiliar <b>accent,</b> with keyword recognition accuracy being reduced. These findings both replicate previous findings on the effects <b>of</b> auditory <b>accent,</b> and indicate that accent can also impact the understanding of visual speech...|$|R

40|$|Chapter 1 is an {{introduction}} to the Malagasy language and gives a historical background of how the notion <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> was introduced in the description of Malagasy phonology. Chapter 2 deals with Malagasy words, their formation, their accent patterns and the rules which have been so far claimed to govern the accent patterns and the accent shift in Malagasy.

Chapter 3 covers a series of experiments on the judgment <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> (in words and in sentences) conducted by the present author on different groups of listeners namely, linguistically trained and untrained speakers of different Malagasy dialects and Malagasy speakers' judgment <b>of</b> <b>accent</b> in a foreign language (Welsh-English).
