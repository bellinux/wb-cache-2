2500|$|Bjelland {{has been}} noted by music critics for her unique {{screaming}} vocals. Journalist Richard Cromelin noted in a 1992 Los Angeles Times profile that [...] "She retches her enraged lyrics, her screams skid across the beat and collide with the blunt riffs. Her voice erupts into laughs and gargles, then croons down low with eerie detachment." [...] Commenting on her musical aspirations, Bjelland said: [...] "It should sound like nothing that you've heard before. That's my intention... Like my singing, all I try to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>I</b> just push myself into things where I think I can't reach notes and stuff. Sometimes it sounds really ridiculous, but then {{you just kind of}} work on it." [...] In Babes in Toyland, Bjelland's instrumentation and songwriting have been described as [...] "ugly, crunching post-punk," [...] supplemented by [...] "rudimentary" [...] guitar chords.|$|E

But I have a satisfaction when I {{get to the end of}} the quarter and find that there is not half-a-crown due to any one. Things get dearer and dearer, but I have a comfort even in that. I have a feeling that I should like to bring myself to the straw a day." [...] Of course there were offers made of aid,--offers which were rather prayers,--and plans suggested of what might be done between Brooke and Hugh; but Priscilla declared that all such plans were odious to her. [...] "Why should you be unhappy about us?" [...] she continued.

60|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that fellowships might be given to rising artists, pecuniary assistance being attached to those fellowships, the artist being required annually to send in some specimen of his work to show what he was doing, but it being left optional with him to go abroad or to work at home; should you think that would be desirable, or as {{has been suggested}} in a letter by Mr. Armitage, supposing those fellowships to be established for four years, that two of those years should be spent abroad and two at home?--Without entering into any detail as to whether two years should be spent abroad and two years at home, I feel very strongly {{that one of the most}} dangerous and retarding influences you have operating upon art is the enormous power of money, and the chances of entirely winning or entirely losing, that is, of making your fortune in a year by a large taking picture, or else starving for ten years by very good small ones. The whole life of an artist is a lottery, and a very wild lottery, and the best artist is liable to be warped away from what he knows is right by the chance of at once making a vast fortune by catching the public eye, the public eye being only to be caught by bright colors and certain conditions of art not always desirable. If, therefore, connected with the Academy schools there could be the means of giving a fixed amount of income to certain men, who would as a consideration for that income furnish a certain number of works that might be agreed upon, or undertake any national work that might be agreed upon, that I believe would be the healthiest way in which a good painter could be paid. To give him his bread and cheese, and so much a day, and say, Here are such and such things we want you to <b>do,</b> <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> believe, the healthiest, simplest, and happiest way in which great work can be produced. But whether it is compatible with our present system I cannot say, nor whether every man would not run away as soon as he found he could get two or three thousand pounds by painting a catching picture. I think your best men would not.|$|E

That {{people do not have}} it more than they <b>do</b> <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> believe, because persons speak so much in large-drawn, theological similitudes, and won't say out what they mean about life, and man, and God, in fair and square human language. I wonder if you or my father ever thought of the obscurities that lie upon human duty from the negative form in which the Ten Commandments are stated, or of how Christ was so continually substituting affirmations. 'Thou shalt not' is but an example; 'Thou shalt' is the law of God. It was this that seems meant in the phrase that 'not one jot nor tittle of the law should pass.' But what led me to the remark is this: A kind of black, angry look goes with that statement of the law of negatives. 'To love one's neighbour as oneself' is certainly much harder, but states life so much more actively, gladly, and kindly, that you begin to see some pleasure in it; and till you can see pleasure in these hard choices and bitter necessities, where is there any Good News to men? It is much more important to do right than not to do wrong; further, the one is possible, the other has always been and will ever be impossible; and the faithful DESIGN TO DO RIGHT is accepted by God; that {{seems to me to be}} the Gospel, and that was how Christ delivered us from the Law. After people are told that, surely they might hear more encouraging sermons. To blow the trumpet for good would seem the Parson's business; and since it is not in our own strength, but by faith and perseverance (no account made of slips), that we are to run the race, I do not see where they get the material for their gloomy discourses. Faith is not to believe the Bible, but to believe in God; if you believe in God (or, for it's the same thing, have that assurance you speak about), where is there any more room for terror? There are only three possible attitudes - Optimism, which has gone to smash; Pessimism, which is on the rising hand, and very popular with many clergymen who seem to think they are Christians. And this Faith, which is the Gospel. Once you hold the last, it is your business (1) to find out what is right in any given case, and (2) to try to do it; if you fail in the last, that is by commission, Christ tells you to hope; if you fail in the first, that is by omission, his picture of the last day gives you but a black lookout. The whole necessary morality is kindness; and it should spring, of itself, from the one fundamental doctrine, Faith. If you are sure that God, in the long run, means kindness by you, you should be happy; and if happy, surely you should be kind.|$|E

[...] He has described his style of music with one word: Philosophunk! “I’m {{a big fan of}} Frank Zappa, Talking Heads, XTC, the Beatles, and things like that.

I never left Nebraska mentally to a degree, like I’m still a fan of anyone who skates incredible, ends up just skating.So if a kid from Nebraska could see how being on this side of the baker’s window, if he could see what goes on here and how we make the bread, and what temperature we cook the bread at, they would be psyched.

5000|$|Fahri's {{account of}} events {{was that he}} panicked when {{he thought he was}} losing grip on the {{advertising}} sign. Fahri, crying, said: [...] "I can feel it coming out of my hands so I panicked. I looked to my left. There was a tray there. I picked it up and threw it. I didn't mean to hit him, I didn't. I just threw it. I thought he would put his hands up so he'd let go of the sign. All I wanted to <b>do</b> <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> didn't want him to hit me with the sign, so I picked up the dish. I didn't think it would smash and I threw it and it hit him and it hit him. I didn't mean... I didn't mean it to... for that to happen... I didn't mean to hit him. didn't want to hurt him, didn't want to. I might have been lippy at the start, you know, but I didn't mean it to happen." [...] He said he ran off when Jimmy Mizen let go of the sign. He was challenged by Jimmy's older brother Tommy, 27, outside the shop. Fahri said he only learned of Mizen's death when his mother rang him to explain what had happened. Fahri said he went in the shop for a sandwich. He changed his mind and turning around saw Mizen was standing in his way. Fahri said: [...] "I've made a step and looked at him to say, you know I'm trying to get past. I didn't get no reaction so I've brushed past him and he's obviously, he took offence to that, and he said 'Don't touch me'." [...] He then challenged the Mizens to go outside but re-entered after seeing Harry on the phone summoning Tommy to help.|$|E
5000|$|As of December 2016, Annihilator {{has begun}} {{working on their}} sixteenth studio album. Waters stated, [...] "On the next one, the changes I'm gonna make… I only said two things. I've got all these people telling me, 'You've gotta {{go back to this}} album,' or that album, or that album, or that album. 'You've gotta do this,' 'You've gotta do that.' So what I <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>I</b> block it out. But I've decided that I'm going to not worry about catchy, {{commercial}} choruses — 'commercial,' as in you remember it, where you intentionally make that chorus {{the most important part of}} the song and you want people to remember that one every time. That kind of is the opposite of what I used to do in the earlier days. In the earlier days, I would go, 'I don't care about the chorus being the main part; I want the whole song to be cool.' So therefore the choruses were not as commercial or catchy. And they remained heavy back then; the choruses would end up being heavy. Whereas on my Suicide Society record I just did, you could have a heavy song, but then you hit the chorus and you go, 'Woah, that's pretty mainstream stuff in the choruses.' And the other thing was, since I'm such a fan of so many bands, I let myself go a little bit on the last album with being too blatantly obvious with my influences and my musical loves as a fan. So you really heard a song that had a lot of the Master of Puppets era of music from Metallica, and you really heard a Megadeth-y song on there, and you really heard in my vocals some Hetfield and Mustaine-isms. And I think that was great, as a fan, to get it out, but I think I need to do more of my own thing on the next record." ...|$|E

The interview was conducted in 2014, and in this clip the interviewee is responding to the question 'What elements of your writing performances would you identify as weak or less than successful, and why?'Brief excerpt from interview: Before I had people read over my work, I would just kind of think it in my head, type it out, and submit it.

The idea of culture, the idea of me wanting to explain how my culture works or explain how my island works as opposed to how this island works or as opposed to how another island works. It's me wanting to promote what we see and what we believe as a culture because I am very proud of my culture and I am very proud of where I came from. This is me expressing my island's culture.
