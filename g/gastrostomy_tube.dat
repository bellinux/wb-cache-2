5|$|Infants and {{patients}} fed via a <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tube</b> {{can also be}} given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a prescribed powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula. Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total cholesterol than a solid ketogenic diet. KetoCal is a nutritionally complete food containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding. Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia. Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.|$|E
25|$|Corn starch {{can be used}} in feeding; {{unexpected}} interruptions {{of continuous}} feeding regimens can result in sudden, hypoglycemia, <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tube</b> insertion (requires a minor surgical procedure) is used for such feeding.Prolonged glucocorticoid use incurs the many unpleasant side effects of Cushing's syndrome, while diazoxide can cause fluid retention requiring concomitant use of a diuretic, and prolonged use causes hypertrichosis. Diazoxide works by opening the KATP channels of the beta cells. Octreotide must be given by injection several times a day or a subcutaneous pump must be inserted every few days, octreotide can cause abdominal discomfort and responsiveness to octreotide often wanes over time. Glucagon requires continuous intravenous infusion, and has a very short half life.|$|E
25|$|Reported toxicities include {{dry mouth}} (xerostomia) from salivary gland damage, 18% (grade 2); {{difficulty}} swallowing (dysphagia) from {{damage to the}} constrictor muscles, larynx and oesophageal sphincter, 15% (grade 2); subclinical aspiration up to 50% (reported incidence of aspiration pneumonia approximately 14%); hypothyroidism 28–38% at three years (may be up to 55% depending on amount of the thyroid gland exposed to over 45Gy radiation; esophageal stenosis 5%; osteonecrosis of the mandible 2.5%; and need for a <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tube</b> to be placed {{at some point during}} or up to one year after treatment 4% (up to 16% with longer follow up). Concerns have been expressed regarding excessive short and long term toxicity, especially dysphagia and xerostomia, and hence whether standard doses expose patients with better prognoses are being exposed to overtreatment and unnecessary side effects.|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the unlicensed {{use of a}} Foley catheter in home enteral tube feeding in the community. It {{is now clear that}} patients on long-term enteral feeding in the community may require replacement of their feeding tubes due to deterioration, damage or tube dislodgment. Often, these conventional feeding tubes such as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and radiologically inserted <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> are replaced with similar tubes or with balloon <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tubes.</b> However, the use of a Foley catheter in place of conventional feeding tubes as replacement tube has been observed in a number of patients in practice and documented in literature. The Foley catheter is significantly less expensive and easily accessible than conventional feeding <b>tubes</b> or balloon <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tubes.</b> However, its use as an enteral feeding tube has implications for practice in terms of its use as unlicensed product, consent, ethics and professional responsibilities. Issues relating to body image and quality of life are also discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR...|$|R
50|$|A {{major issue}} has been {{aspiration}} pneumonia, where food or regurgitated stomach content would be aspirated into the lungs causing infections. Fundoplications (by preventing regurgitation) and <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> (to provide nonoral nutrition) have reduced the frequency of hospitalization.|$|R

25|$|The {{basic concept}} behind interventional {{radiology}} is to diagnose or treat pathologies, {{with the most}} minimally invasive technique possible. Minimally invasive procedures are currently performed more than ever before. These procedures are often performed with the patient fully awake, {{with little or no}} sedation required. Interventional Radiologists and Interventional Radiographers diagnose and treat several disorders, including peripheral vascular disease, renal artery stenosis, inferior vena cava filter placement, <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tube</b> placements, biliary stents and hepatic interventions. Images are used for guidance, and the primary instruments used during the procedure are needles and catheters. The images provide maps that allow the Clinician to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing disease. By minimizing the physical trauma to the patient, peripheral interventions can reduce infection rates and recovery times, as well as hospital stays. To be a trained interventionalist in the United States, an individual completes a five-year residency in radiology and a one- or two-year fellowship in IR.|$|E
25|$|The {{probability}} of xerostomia at one year increases by 5% for every 1Gy increase in dose to the parotid gland. Doses above 25–30Gy {{are associated with}} moderate to severe xerostomia. Similar considerations apply to the submandibular gland, but xerostomia is less common if only one parotid gland {{is included in the}} radiated field and the contralateral submandibular gland is spared (less than 39Gy) In the same manner, radiation dose to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, larynx, and cricopharyngeal inlet determine the risk of dysphagia (and hence dependence on <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tube</b> feeds). The threshold for this toxicity is volume-dependent at 55–60Gy, with moderate to severe impairment of swallowing, including aspiration, stricture and feeding tube dependence above a mean dose of 47Gy, with a recommended dose to the inferior constrictor of less than 41Gy. Dose-toxicity relationships for the superior and middle constrictors are steep, with a 20% increase in the {{probability of}} dysphagia for each 10Gy. Doses above 30Gy to the thyroid are associated with moderate to severe hypothyroidism. Subjective, patient-reported outcomes of quality of life also correlate with radiation dose received.|$|E

40|$|Context Percutaneous {{endoscopic}} gastrostomy (PEG) feedings {{are generally}} considered safe with few serious complications. Acute pancreatitis {{is a rare}} complication associated with replacement percutaneous endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tubes.</b> Case report We report two cases of acute pancreatitis induced by migrated replacement percutaneous endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tubes.</b> Conclusions Migration of a balloon into the duodenum can result in external manipulation of the ampulla of Vater thereby disturbing the flow of pancreatic secretions leading to acute pancreatitis. Recognition of this complication is important and should be included as potential etiology of acute pancreatitis in patients receiving percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feedings. Periodic examination and documentation of {{the distance of the}} balloon from the skin should be performed to document the position of the tubes or any inadvertent migration of the tubes. The use of Foley catheters as permanent replacement tubes should be considered medically inappropriate...|$|R

25|$|Feeding tubes can {{decrease}} {{the risk of}} aspiration by enabling persons to avoid liquids or foods {{that are difficult to}} swallow and provide adequate calories without the stress and time commitment of prolonged meals. <b>Gastrostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> do not prevent people from eating by mouth. Once a tube is in place, the general goal should be to maintain weight at the 10-25th percentile.|$|R
2500|$|There is {{no known}} cure for Niemann–Pick type C, {{nor is there}} any FDA-standard {{approved}} disease modifying treatment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{evidence}} {{on the effectiveness of}} medical management of bowel obstruction for patients with advanced cancer and to summarize treatment options for home and hospital care. DATA SOURCES: Articles were identified by searching MEDLINE. STUDY SELECTION: Research articles published between 1973 and 1995 on the surgical and medical management of bowel obstruction in patients with advanced cancer were identified. Seven original research articles on medical management were identified and all were reviewed and critically appraised. Given the small number of original papers in this field, studies using prospective and retrospective methodology were included. Articles looking only at the use of percutaneous <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> and subcutaneous hydration were used in the formulation of treatment recommendations but were not critically reviewed. A critical appraisal of the surgical literature was not undertaken. SYNTHESIS: Recommendations regarding medical management of bowel obstruction were based on strength of evidence for improving symptoms with pharmacologic treatment. The few clinical trials were uncontrolled trials with small samples. The trials show improvement of symptom control with pharmacologic management using morphine, anticholinergics, major tranquilizers, corticosteroids, and somatostatin analogues. Intravenous hydration was unnecessary for most patients. Percutaneous <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> are effective for patients with proximal intestinal obstruction and intractable vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacologic management and percutaneous gastrostomy for intractable vomiting and hypodermoclysis or oral fluids for hydration can control symptoms without surgery or nasogastric tubes...|$|R
50|$|While {{the first}} court {{to hear the}} case agreed that Mr. Brophy would have wanted the <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tube</b> removed, it refused to authorize its removal, principally because he was not terminally ill.

50|$|All feeding tubes will {{eventually}} {{need to be}} changed because of wear and tear, or a clogged lumen. The change of a <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tube</b> is not without risks. The loop-gastrostomy tube is a recent innovation which minimizes the risks of tube change.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{for those}} with {{lissencephaly}} is symptomatic and depends on the severity and locations of the brain malformations.

If feeding becomes difficult, a <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tube</b> may be considered.|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{procedures}} {{have been developed}} to provide adequate enteral nutrition to patients with gastrointestinal disorders. Previously, operative placement of a feeding <b>gastrostomy</b> or jejunostomy <b>tube</b> was the accepted means of gaining chronic enteral access. However, improved technology and experience with endoscopic techniques have quickly replaced primary operative placement of enteral access. Direct percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (D-PEJ) is a procedure that was designed to deliver enteral feeding solutions for patients with proximal disease after unsatisfactory results from percutaneous endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> with jejunal extensions (PEG-J). As with any procedure, it is associated with complications. We present the first reported case of a colojejunal fistula resulting from a D-PEJ placement. While D-PEJ {{has been shown to be}} relatively safe, complications related to the inherent limitations of the procedure need to be considered when the patient experiences unusual post-procedure symptoms and worked up appropriately.

50|$|Many {{patients}} have a <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tube</b> (g-tube) inserted for medication and/or feeds. Some patients develop oral aversions and {{will use the}} tube for all feeds.

5000|$|A {{method for}} {{inserting}} a feeding <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tube</b> {{without the need}} for surgery was first described in 1980. [...] This endoscopic technique is of particular use as many patients who require feeding tubes (such as after patients with swallowing difficulties after a stroke) are at high risk for complications from anaesthesia and surgery; the endoscopic technique usually requires mild sedation only.|$|E
50|$|The {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in infants with Robin sequence focus upon breathing and feeding, and optimizing growth and nutrition despite the predisposition for breathing difficulties. If {{there is evidence}} of airway obstruction (snorty breathing, apnea, difficulty taking a breath, or drops in oxygen), then the infant should be placed in the sidelying or prone position, which helps bring the tongue base forward in many children. One study of 60 infants with PRS found that 63% of infants responded to prone positioning (Smith and Senders, 2006, Int J Pediatr Oto). 53% of the infants in this study required some form of feeding assistance, either nasogastric tube or <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tube</b> feedings (feeding directly into the stomach). In a separate study of 115 children with the clinical diagnosis of PRS managed at 2 different hospitals in Boston (Evans et al., 2006, In J Pediatr Oto), respiratory distress was managed successfully in 56% without an operation (either by prone positioning, short term intubation, or placement of a nasopharyngeal airway). In this study, <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tube</b> feeding were placed in 42% of these infants due to feeding difficulties.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the lung, the stomach, rectum, and bladder are relatively easy targets for local drug delivery. Gastric access via nasogastric <b>tubes</b> or <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> provides route for nutrition support and drug delivery [24]. Enema {{has been used for}} topical administration of medication into the rectum, for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis, and other diseases, which avoids having the medication passing through the whole gastrointestinal tract [25]. The intravesical instillation of drugs has been used to treat superficial bladder cancer [26], painful bladder syndrome and recurrent urinary tract infection [27], and other diseases. Nanoparticle-based drugs can be delivered through these techniques.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to raise {{awareness}} ofthe risk for medication error-induced injuries associated with medical devices that have balloon inflation valves/ports. Such devices include tracheostomy <b>tubes,</b> endotracheal <b>tubes,</b> <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tubes,</b> and Foley catheters. The connections for the balloon-inflation valves are designed to accommodate parenteral syringes (and therefore can also accommodate IV tubing). This interconnectivity may lead to inadvertent administration of a medication into a balloon, resulting in hyperinflation of the balloon and the potential for serious harm to the patient. The special feature below describes reports of such errors and includes pictures of the products to illustrate that the functionality of the balloon inflation valve is not necessarily intuitive and is not clearly identified on th...|$|R

50|$|The <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tube</b> is {{associated}} with {{its own set of}} complications. Leakage of gastric contents (containing hydrochloric acid) around the tube into the abdominal (peritoneal) cavity results in peritonitis, a serious complication which will cause death if it is not properly treated. Septic shock is another possible complication. Minor leakage may cause irritation of the skin around the gastrostomy site or stoma. Barrier creams, to protect the skin from the corrosive acid, are generally recommended.|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, two {{methods have been}} used to achieve this goal in young children: (1) {{continuous}} nocturnal gastric infusion of glucose or starch; and (2) night-time feedings of uncooked cornstarch. An elemental formula, glucose polymer, and/or cornstarch can be infused continuously through the night at a rate supplying 0.5-0.6 g/kg/h of glucose for an infant, or 0.3-0.4 for an older child. This method requires a nasogastric or <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tube</b> and pump. Sudden death from hypoglycemia has occurred due to malfunction or disconnection, and periodic cornstarch feedings are now preferred to continuous infusion.|$|E
50|$|A jejunostomy {{feeding tube}} (J-tube) is a tube surgically or endoscopically {{inserted}} through the abdomen {{and into the}} jejunum (the {{second part of the}} small intestine). Please note that alternatively a jejunostomy commonly refers to a surgical fistula created connecting the jejunum or the abdominal wall. There are several techniques for placement, including a direct surgical or endoscopic technique, or a more complicated Roux-en-Y procedure. The J-tube may use a long, catheter-like tube or a button. Depending on the placement type, the tube may be changed at home, or may need to be changed at a hospital. A J-tube is helpful for individuals with poor gastric motility, chronic vomiting, or at high risk for aspiration and in those in whom <b>gastrostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> are contraindicated.|$|R
