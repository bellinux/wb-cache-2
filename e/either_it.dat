5|$|According to Crowley, Reuss {{had named}} him {{head of the}} O.T.O. upon his death, but this was {{challenged}} by {{a leader of the}} German O.T.O., Heinrich Tränker. Tränker called the Hohenleuben Conference in Thuringia, Germany, which Crowley attended. There, prominent members like Karl Germer and Martha Küntzel championed Crowley's leadership, but other key figures like Albin Grau, Oskar Hopfer, and Henri Birven backed Tränker by opposing it, resulting in a split in the O.T.O. Moving to Paris, where he broke with Olsen in 1926, Crowley went through a large number of lovers over the following years, with whom he experimented in sex magic. Throughout, he was dogged by poor health, largely caused by his heroin and cocaine addictions. In 1928, Crowley was introduced to young Englishman Israel Regardie, who embraced Thelema and became Crowley's secretary for the next three years. That year, Crowley also met Gerald Yorke, who began organising Crowley's finances but never became a Thelemite. He also befriended Thomas Driberg; Driberg did not accept Thelema <b>either.</b> <b>It</b> was here that Crowley also published one of his most significant works, Magick in Theory and Practice, which received little attention at the time.|$|E
5|$|In towns, the Cape sparrow {{competes with}} both the native {{southern}} grey-headed sparrow and house sparrow, which was introduced to southern Africa in the 19thcentury. Since it is more established around humans in its range than <b>either,</b> <b>it</b> successfully competes with both species, though they may exclude it from nesting in holes. A survey by birdwatchers completed in 2000 found the Cape sparrow increasing in abundance in some suburban areas of South Africa (the northern Johannesburg area, and Pietermaritzburg) and decreasing in others (the southern Cape Town area). The house sparrow was reported decreasing in several urban areas, {{as it has in}} parts of Europe, declines which are attributed to factors including the increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation.|$|E
5|$|Two {{species are}} {{regarded}} as valid today: the type species S. osborni, and S. angustirostris. S. osborni (Brown, 1912) is known from a skull and skeleton, two other complete skulls, and skull fragments. S. angustirostris (Rozhdestvensky, 1952) is known from at least 15 specimens. It differs from S. osborni by some details of the skull, {{as well as in}} the pattern of scales found in skin impressions. The Mongolian species had a longer skull (by 20%) and the front of the snout (the premaxillary bones) were more upwardly directed. S. angustirostris also had a distinctive row of rectangular scales along the midline of the back and tail, known as 'midline feature-scales'; these are not currently preserved in S. osborni. In S. angustirostris, the scales on the tail flank were arranged in vertical patterns, which may have corresponded to striped coloration in life. This area was covered in radial scale patterns in S. osborni, possibly indicating a more mottled or spotted coloration. S. kryschtofovici (Riabinin, 1930) is not considered valid; <b>either</b> <b>it</b> is regarded as a dubious name, or as a synonym of S. angustirostris (although the name antedates S. angustirostris).|$|E

Much of {{south-western}} Britain {{rebelled against}} the Act of Uniformity 1549, which introduced the obligatory use of the Protestant Book of Common Prayer. Cornwall was mostly Catholic in sympathy at this time; the Act was doubly resented in Cornwall because the Prayer Book was in English only and most Cornish people at this time spoke the Cornish language rather than English. They therefore wished church services {{to continue to be}} conducted in Latin; although they did not understand this language <b>either,</b> <b>it</b> had the benefit of long-established tradition and lacked the political and cultural connotations of the use of English.

25|$|The {{absence of}} all notice of Heraclea during the {{subsequent}} century, and {{the wars of}} Dionysius I of Syracuse with the Carthaginians, suggests that <b>either</b> <b>it</b> did not then exist, or {{must have been in}} a very reduced condition. However the territory of Heraclea Minoa fell under Carthaginian control {{as a result of the}} treaty of 405BC. The next mention of it (under the name of Minoa), when Dion landed there in 357BC, represents it as a small town in the Agrigentine territory, but still subject to Carthage. Hence it is probable that the treaty between Dionysius and the Carthaginians which had fixed the Halycus as the boundary of the latter, had left Heraclea, though on its southeast bank, still in their hands: and, in accordance with this, we find it stipulated by the similar treaty concluded with them by Agathocles (314BC), that Heraclea, Selinus, and Himera should continue subject to Carthage, as they had been before.|$|E
25|$|After the EPR paper, quantum {{mechanics}} {{was in an}} unsatisfactory position: <b>either</b> <b>it</b> was incomplete, {{in the sense that}} it failed to account for some elements of physical reality, or it violated the principle of a finite propagation speed of physical effects. In a modified version of the EPR thought experiment, two hypothetical observers, now commonly referred to as Alice and Bob, perform independent measurements of spin on a pair of electrons, prepared at a source in a special state called a spin singlet state. It is the conclusion of EPR that once Alice measures spin in one direction (e.g. on the x axis), Bob's measurement in that direction is determined with certainty, as being the opposite outcome to that of Alice, whereas immediately before Alice's measurement Bob's outcome was only statistically determined (i.e., was only a probability, not a certainty); thus, either the spin in each direction is an element of physical reality, or the effects travel from Alice to Bob instantly.|$|E
25|$|Crematogaster brevispinosa rochai is one {{subspecies}} of ant whose {{interaction with}} N. corniger has been studied. C. b. rochai lives {{in areas of}} caatinga in Brazil. No queens of the ant {{have been found in}} the nests but their larvae of all castes and sexes have been. Nests that contain C. b. rochai do not have a termite queen in <b>either.</b> <b>It</b> can therefore be concluded that both the ants and termites are members of polydomous colonies that each have multiple nest sites. The ants and termites are segregated within the nest and do not normally come into contact with each other. C. b. rochai plug channels at the boundary of the areas they occupy to cause this segregation. On occasions when the ants and termites do come into contact with each other (e.g. if the nest is broken into) they are rarely aggressive and tend to avoid each other instead. It has been hypothesised that the hydrocarbon content of their cuticles may have changed to allow them to live together relatively peacefully.|$|E

25|$|The European Space Agency is {{building}} the Euclid telescope. Due to launch in 2020 it will map galaxies up to 10 billion light years away. By seeing how dark energy influences their arrangement and shape, the mission will allow scientists {{to see if}} the strength of dark energy has changed. If dark energy is found to vary throughout time it would indicate it is due to quintessence, where observed acceleration is due to the energy of a scalar field, rather than the cosmological constant. No evidence of quintessence is yet available, but it has not been ruled out <b>either.</b> <b>It</b> generally predicts a slightly slower acceleration of {{the expansion of the universe}} than the cosmological constant. Some scientists think that the best evidence for quintessence would come from violations of Einstein's equivalence principle and variation of the fundamental constants in space or time. Scalar fields are predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics and string theory, but an analogous problem to the cosmological constant problem (or the problem of constructing models of cosmological inflation) occurs: renormalization theory predicts that scalar fields should acquire large masses again due to zero-point energy.|$|E
25|$|Because {{most of the}} Circum-Superior Belt {{was formed}} by {{widespread}} mafic-ultramafic magmatism 1,884to 1,864million years ago along the Superior craton margin during these orogenies, {{a number of different}} suggestions have been made to explain the questionable origins of this large igneous province. It is also not clear if the Circum-Superior Belt has a single origin or it has several origins. Suggestions include back-arc rifting, foredeep flexure, mantle plumes and the breakup of a microcontinent. The geochemical indication of the Circum-Superior Belt is also poorly known; <b>either</b> <b>it</b> contains major regional differences or it is the same throughout the magmatic zone. With the discovery of the Pickle Crow dike swarm throughout the western Superior craton, the likelihood of other 1,880million year old dike groups throughout the Superior craton remains. This is partly because several dike zones in the Superior craton remain undated. The relationship of the Circum-Superior Belt with similar age magmatism throughout the nearby Trans-Hudson belt and elsewhere on Earth is also unknown. This includes the 1,860million year old magmatism of the East Kimberly event in Australia and 1,860million year old magmatism of the Mashonaland event in Africa. The other questionable suggestion related to the Circum-Superior Belt is the existence of a suggested 1,900million year old global superplume event.|$|E
