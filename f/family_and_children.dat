5|$|A violent multiple-vortex tornado struck {{portions}} of extreme northern Georgia and southeast Tennessee during the mid-evening hours of April 27. It touched down along Davis Ridge Road in Catoosa County, Georgia, and {{moved through the}} town of Ringgold at EF3 strength, destroying numerous homes and businesses. A Baymont Inn & Suites, located near Interstate 75 was partially destroyed by the tornado, along with a McDonald's, a Taco Bell, and several gas stations located on Highway 151 in Ringgold at the Interstate 75 interchange (exit 348). The Catoosa County Department of <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Children</b> Services and other businesses on Nashville Street in downtown Ringgold were also heavily damaged. The Kellerhals Center for Visual Arts Education at Ringgold High School was destroyed (RHS itself had minor damage), and Ringgold Middle School was heavily damaged. Past downtown Ringgold, the tornado reached EF4 intensity as it tore through a subdivision along Cherokee Valley Road at the north edge of town. Twelve homes were completely obliterated and swept away at that location (though they were not well-built). There were 74 destroyed homes and/or businesses, 60 with major damage, and 118 with minor damage {{for a total of}} 252 affected structures in the Ringgold area. Eight people were killed, mainly at the subdivision along Cherokee Valley Road.|$|E

25|$|A {{key issue}} {{that remains is}} the lack of female {{representation}} in management. Of all legislators, senior officials and management, females are found in only 9% of the positions. This disparity has contributed to the larger overall gender wage gap of females earning only 66.5% of male earnings in 2002. Prevalent social opinions suggest that this disparity is {{due to the lack of}} commit of Japanese women to their jobs due to their perspectives regarding marriage, <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> <b>children.</b> While the government had imposed the Equal Opportunity Law, companies responded by creating a ‘double-track management system’ (DPM), where a career track allows for promotions but requires transfers, and a non-career track that does not require transfers but has low chances of promotion. Previously, employers often maintained a core workforce mainly consisting of male employees which was expected to work at head office and be transferred around the world, and a peripheral workforce of female employees working at local branches with restricted career advancement. However, uptake by females of the career track is extremely low at less than 4% in all industries. Given the strong internal labour market of Japanese companies which stipulates that senior positions are only given to those in the career track and not from sources external to the company, this has contributed to the low proportion of female managers. This DPM system is also prevalent, especially among larger firms, with 51.2% of firms with more than 5,000 employees using the system. Gendered divisions exist in the workplace and are replicated by both male and female workers. Although both genders may be allocated to the same section, males were often trained and allocated towards management jobs. As a result, female workers often were not in or chose not to be in management jobs due to lack of training, experience, and opportunity. In addition, more than half of surveyed companies indicated that they were attempting to eradicate instances of sexual harassment and discriminatory practices by males towards female workers, indicating an existing environment of a male-dominated workplace.|$|E

2500|$|Camp Snoopy {{is home to}} the park's <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> rides, {{with many}} of the rides and attractions being built {{specifically}} for children and guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive attractions. Its theme is Charles M. Schulz' [...] "Peanuts" [...] comic strip characters. Snoopy has been the mascot of Knott's Berry Farm since 1983, and the characters can now be seen at all of Cedar Fair's parks, except Gilroy Gardens, which is managed by Cedar Fair and owned by the city of Gilroy. The 14 rides include a mini roller coaster called the Timberline Twister, a mini-scrambler called the Log Peeler, a Zamperla Rockin' Tug called Lucy's Tugboat, and a steel spinning roller coaster called Sierra Sidewinder. Snoopy Bounce is a small attraction for kids. However, it is not considered a ride at the park. For guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive and thrilled rides, Camp Snoopy contains a good amount of rides for guests of all ages including infants, children, and seniors. With the exception of Sierra Sidewinder and Timberline Twister, the rides are relativity tame and not aggressive.|$|E
2500|$|Cynthia Ann Parker, or Naduah (Comanche Narua) ( [...] – March 1871) was an Anglo-American who {{was kidnapped}} in 1836, {{at the age}} of about ten (possibly as young as 8 or already over 11 – her birth year is uncertain), by a Comanche war band, who had massacred her family's settlement. Her Comanche name means [...] "someone found." [...] She was adopted by the Comanche and lived with them for 24 years, {{completely}} forgetting her white ways. She married a Comanche chieftain, Peta Nocona, and had three children with him, including the last free Comanche chief, Quanah Parker. At approximately age 34, she was relocated by the Texas Rangers, but spent the remaining ten years of her life refusing to adjust to life in white society. At least once, she escaped and tried to return to her Comanche <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> but was again brought back to Texas. She found it difficult to understand her iconic status to the nation, which saw her as having been redeemed from the Comanches.
