At high powers, the {{nonlinear}} part of the index of refraction becomes important and causes a higher index of refraction {{in the center of}} the laser beam, where the laser is brighter than at the edges, causing a feedback that focuses the laser even more. The tighter focused laser has a higher peak brightness (irradiance) that forms a plasma. The plasma has an index of refraction lower than one, and causes a defocusing of the laser beam. The interplay of the focusing index of refraction, and the defocusing plasma makes the formation of a long filament of plasma that can be micrometers to kilometers in length. One interesting aspect of the filamentation generated plasma is the relatively low <b>ion</b> <b>density</b> due to defocusing effects of the ionised electrons.
