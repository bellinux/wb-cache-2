5|$|Also {{in eastern}} Slavonia, the Lovas {{massacre}} occurred in October and the Erdut massacre in November 1991, {{before and after}} the fall of Vukovar. At the same time, the Škabrnja massacre occurred in the northern Dalmatian hinterland; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> overshadowed by the events at Vukovar.|$|E
5|$|Igman was {{included}} in the Sarajevo bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Despite Sarajevo being the only previous host city to bid, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> regarded as the weakest bid, primarily due to its lack of infrastructure after the war.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{controversy}} regarding the preparations, however, once the assault began around 4 p.m., Longstreet pressed the assault by McLaws and Hood (Pickett's division had not yet arrived) competently against fierce Union resistance, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> unsuccessful, with significant casualties.|$|E

5|$|Dressed in {{mourning}} {{for the remainder}} of her life, Queen Mary's first act as regent was to disseminate a manifesto, outlining James Francis Edward's claims. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> ignored in England. In Scotland, however, the confederate Lords sent Lord Belhaven to Saint-Germain, to convince the Queen to surrender to them custody of James Francis Edward and accede to his conversion to Protestantism.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, the railway's {{arrival in}} Skagen not only {{led to the}} {{expansion}} of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists as they could no longer find suitable accommodation or venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901 and Holger Drachmann in 1903.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Saadiq {{released}} his debut solo album Instant Vintage, which received critical acclaim and earned him five Grammy Award nominations. However, despite attaining a following among listeners in Europe, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> ignored by contemporary R listeners in the United States {{and did not}} sell well. After its release, he was dropped by his record label Universal Records.|$|E
5|$|In late June, the Aćimović {{administration}} {{issued an}} ordinance regarding {{the administration of}} the Banat which essentially made the region a separate civil administrative unit {{under the control of the}} local Volksdeutsche under the leadership of Sepp Janko. While the Banat was formally under the jurisdiction of the Aćimović administration, in practical terms <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> autonomous of Belgrade and under the direction of the military government through the military area command in Pančevo.|$|E
5|$|Mount Street {{has been}} a popular street for shops since Mayfair was first {{developed}} in the 18th century. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> rebuilt between 1880 and 1900 {{under the direction of}} the 1st Duke of Westminster, while a nearby workhouse was relocated to Pimlico. It now houses a number of shops dealing with luxury trades.|$|E

5|$|The European Space Research Organization (ESRO) {{established}} Kongsfjord Telemetry Station in Ny-Ålesund {{as one of}} {{its four}} initial European Space Tracking Network stations. The facility remained in use from 1967 to 1974, but was closed as it was not suitable for ESRO's second generation of satellites. During the planning of the station, Longyearbyen had been proposed as a location, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> political concerns by Norwegian authorities to create permanent activity in Ny-Ålesund which lead ESRO to accept the location.|$|E
5|$|The work, {{written in}} a vernacular language, also {{described}} the contemporary social developments and expressed ideas that were considered revolutionary and anticlerical, and addressed {{the political and economic}} decay of the Ottoman Empire. Geographia Neoteriki was welcomed with enthusiasm by western intellectual circles, especially in France, but on the other hand, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> neglected by Greek scholars.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Skopje was in ruins. Most of the {{official}} buildings were restored or rebuilt, but the city experienced new plague and cholera epidemics and many inhabitants emigrated. The Ottoman Turkish Empire as a whole entered in recession and political decline. Many rebellions and pillages occurred in Macedonia during the 18th century, either led by Turkish outlaws, Janissaries or Hajduks. An estimation conducted by French officers around 1836 revealed that at that time Skopje only had around 10,000 inhabitants. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> overwhelmed by two towns of the present-day Republic of Macedonia: Bitola (40,000) and Štip (15–20,000).|$|E

5|$|Naval and {{defensive}} technology continued to improve {{over the next}} few decades, rendering Tilbury Fort's bastion design out-moded. The government considered the defences further down the Thames to be sufficient and Tilbury was therefore not improved; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> redundant as a defensive fortification {{by the end of the}} century, although still in use as a strategic depot. From 1889 onwards it formed a mobilisation centre to support a mobile strike force in the event of an invasion, part of the wider London Defence Scheme, and large storage buildings were built across the site to store materiel.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the church}} is the Church House, which {{is also known as}} the Old School Room. The upstairs room was the local school from the mid or early 15th century, with the village poorhouse below. This has been a venue for social {{activity}} in the village and in 1971 underwent major renovation. It is a Grade II* listed building. Also close {{to the church}} is Chew Court, which was originally a bishop's palace. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> rebuilt in 1656, from which a little survives as the Chew Court of today including an Elizabethan doorway with Doric pilasters. The room over the gatehouse {{is said to have been}} used as a court-room, with the turrets used for holding prisoners. Chew Court is a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|Sogdians also {{lived in}} Imperial China {{and rose to}} special {{prominence}} {{in the military and}} government of the Chinese Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). Sogdian merchants and diplomats traveled as far west as the Byzantine Empire. They played an important part as middlemen in the trade route of the Silk Road. While originally following the faiths of Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism from Persia, Buddhism from India, and Nestorian Christianity from West Asia, the gradual conversion to Islam among the Sogdians and their descendants began with the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana in the 8th century. The Sogdian conversion to Islam was virtually complete {{by the end of the}} Samanid Empire in 999, coinciding with the decline of the Sogdian language, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> supplanted by Persian as well as Turkic languages.|$|E

The bombs were aimed at the Cow and Gate milk factory and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> destroyed. Ten nearby houses were badly damaged. Nine people were killed and thirty seven injured. A {{memorial}} at the dairy site commemorates those killed. The factory later became a district council depot, and was recently bought by the town council for possible use as the site of a new town hall.|$|E
5|$|The bald eagle's {{natural range}} covers most of North America, {{including}} most of Canada, {{all of the}} continental United States, and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran Desert and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec and New England, northern birds are migratory, while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, in the 1950s, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> restricted to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, northern and eastern Canada, and Florida. Today, {{they are much more}} common (almost attaining their peak numbers pre-colonization in North America), and nest in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of nobelium is incompletely characterized {{and is known}} only in aqueous solution, in which it can take on the +3 or +2 oxidation states, the latter being more stable. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> expected before the discovery of nobelium that in solution, it would behave like the other actinides, with the trivalent state being predominant; however, Seaborg predicted in 1949 that the +2 state would also be relatively stable for nobelium, as the No2+ ion would have the ground-state electron configuration 5f14, including the stable filled 5f14 shell. It took nineteen years before this prediction was confirmed.|$|E
