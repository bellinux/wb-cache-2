5|$|The visible {{radiation}} emitted by white dwarfs varies {{over a wide}} color range, from the blue-white color of an O-type main sequence star to the red of an M-type red dwarf. White dwarf <b>effective</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures extend from over 150,000K to barely under 4,000K. In accordance with the Stefan–Boltzmann law, luminosity increases with increasing surface temperature; this surface temperature range corresponds to a luminosity from over 100 times the Sun's to under 1/10,000 that of the Sun's. Hot white dwarfs, with surface temperatures in excess of 30,000K, have been observed to be sources of soft (i.e., lower-energy) X-rays. This enables the composition and structure of their atmospheres to be studied by soft X-ray and extreme ultraviolet observations.|$|E

The latter novel features a {{land and sea}} expedition across the superjovian planet Mesklin to recover a stranded scientific probe. The natives of Mesklin are centipede-like intelligent beings about 50 centimeters long.

25|$|A {{group of}} {{researchers}} at Georgia Tech made {{dye-sensitized solar cells}} with a higher <b>effective</b> <b>surface</b> area by wrapping the cells around a quartz optical fiber. The researchers removed the cladding from optical fibers, grew zinc oxide nanowires along the surface, treated them with dye molecules, surrounded the fibers by an electrolyte and a metal film that carries electrons off the fiber. The cells are six times more efficient than a zinc oxide cell with the same surface area. Photons bounce inside the fiber as they travel, so there are more chances {{to interact with the}} solar cell and produce more current. These devices only collect light at the tips, but future fiber cells could be made to absorb light along {{the entire length of the}} fiber, which would require a coating that is conductive as well as transparent. Max Shtein of the University of Michigan said a sun-tracking system would not be necessary for such cells, and would work on cloudy days when light is diffuse.|$|E

2500|$|Using {{this model}} the {{effective}} temperature of stars is estimated, {{defined as the}} temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the B (blue) or V (visible) range lead to the so-called B-V color index, which increases the redder the star, with the Sun having an index of +0.648 ± 0.006. Combining the U (ultraviolet) and the B indices leads to the U-B index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its U-B index is +0.12. The two indices for two types of stars are compared in the figure with the <b>effective</b> <b>surface</b> temperature of the stars assuming they are black bodies. It {{can be seen that}} there is only a rough correlation. For example, for a given B-V index from the blue-visible region of the spectrum., the curves for both types of star lie below the corresponding black-body U-B index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both types of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same B-V index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths. For example, the Sun has an effective temperature of 5780 K, which can be compared to the temperature of the photosphere of the Sun (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the chromosphere to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the convection zone approximately [...] deep.|$|E

40|$|Although it is {{well known}} that radar waves {{penetrate}} into snow and sea ice, the exact mechanisms for radar-altimeter scattering and its link to the depth of the <b>effective</b> scattering <b>surface</b> from sea ice are still unknown. Previously proposed mechanisms linked the snow ice interface, i. e. the dominating scattering horizon, directly with the depth of the <b>effective</b> scattering <b>surface.</b> However, simulations using a multilayer radar scattering model show that the <b>effective</b> scattering <b>surface</b> is affected by snow-cover and ice properties. With the coming Cryosat- 2 (planned launch 2009) satellite radar altimeter it is proposed that sea ice thickness can be derived by measuring its freeboard. In this study we evaluate the radar altimeter sea ice thickness retrieval uncertainty in terms of floe buoyancy, radar penetration and ice type distribution using both a scattering model and ''Archimedes' principle''. The effect of the snow cover on the floe buoyancy and the radar penetration and on the ice cover spatial and temporal variability is assessed from field campaign measurements in the Arctic and Antarctic. In addition to these well known uncertainties we use high resolution RADARSAT SAR data to simulate errors due to the variability of the <b>effective</b> scattering <b>surface</b> as a result of the sub-footprint spatial backscatter and elevation distribution sometimes called preferential sampling. In particular in areas where ridges represent a significant part of the ice volume (e. g. the Lincoln Sea) the simulated altimeter thickness estimate is lower than the real average footprint thickness. This means that the errors are large, yet manageable if the relevant quantities are known a priori. A discussion of the radar altimeter ice thickness retrieval uncertainties concludes the paper...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} devoted to the <b>effective</b> plastic flow <b>surface</b> of a bi-porous {{material}} saturated by a fluid. The material under consideration exhibits two populations of voids. The smaller voids are spherical voids whereas the larger ones are spheroidal and randomly oriented inside the material. These two populations of voids are subjected to internal pressures due to the presence of gases. Approximate models for the <b>effective</b> plastic flow <b>surface</b> of such a bi-porous saturated material have previously been proposed in (Vincent, P. -G., Monerie, Y., Suquet, P., 2009. International Journal of Solids and Structures 46, 480 - 506), where a three-scale homogenization procedure has been performed: first, smearing out all the small spherical bubbles using a Gurson-like matrix, and second, smearing out the intergranular ellipsoidal bubbles.
