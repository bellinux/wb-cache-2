We therefore compared the effects of pre-exercise <b>hyperhydration</b> and pre-exercise euhydration on endurance capacity, peak power output and selected components of the cardiovascular and thermoregulatory systems during prolonged cycling. Using a randomized, crossover experimental design, 6 endurance-trained subjects underwent a pre-exercise <b>hyperhydration</b> (26 ml of water·kg body mass− 1 with 1. 2 g glycerol·kg body mass− 1) or pre-exercise euhydration period of 80 min, followed by 2 h of cycling at 65 % maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) (26 – 27 °C) that were interspersed by 5, 2 -min intervals performed at 80 % VO 2 max. Following the 2 h cycling exercise, subjects underwent an incremental cycling test to exhaustion. Pre-exercise <b>hyperhydration</b> increased body water by 16. 1 ± 2. 2 ml·kg body mass− 1. During exercise, subjects received 12. 5 ml of sports drink·kg body mass− 1. With pre-exercise <b>hyperhydration</b> and pre-exercise euhydration, respectively, fluid ingestion during exercise replaced 31. 0 ± 2. 9 % and 37. 1 ± 6. 8 % of sweat losses (p> 0. 05).

40|$|Exercising horses {{can lose}} {{in excess of}} 10 - 12 L/hour of fluid as sweat, and during {{prolonged}} exercise, effective circulating volume is diminished. During {{the second day of}} an equestrian 3 -day event (3 DE) there is only a limited opportunity for horses to consume fluids. Dehydration is, therefore, a critical issue for horses performing the second day of a 3 DE, particularly if weather conditions are hot and/or humid. Pre-exercise hydration (<b>hyperhydration</b> or ???fluid-loading???) schemes have been investigated to help maintain blood volume during exercise. However, {{it has been suggested that}} pre-exercise <b>hyperhydration</b> might adversely affect arterial oxygenation in horses exercising at ~ 55 - 60 % of maximum oxygen consumption (Sosa Leon et al. 2002). Exercise induced arterial hypoxemia is not typically seen during moderate exercise in normal horses and <b>hyperhydration</b> (and hypervolemia) does not affect arterial oxygen tension or hemoglobin saturation during short term maximal exertion (Manohar et al. 2003). 	 Studies were carried out on 7 Thoroughbred horses under control and <b>hyperhydration</b> conditions. <b>Hyperhydration</b> (and hypervolemia) was induced by administering NaCl (0. 425 g/kg) via nasogastric tube 5 hours pre-exercise followed by free access to water. Two sets of experiments utilizing different treadmill exercise protocols were performed. The first (Protocol 1) simulated the second day of a mid-level 3 DE and was identical to that of Sosa Leon et al. (2002). The second exercise test (Protocol 2) was shorter in duration but incorporated high intensity exercise known to induce arterial hypoxemia and hemoglobin de-saturation. Blood-gas tensions, hemoglobin saturation, and pH were measured pre-exercise and at various times throughout exercise. In addition, plasma protein concentration, hemoglobin concentration, blood lactate concentration, heart rate and core (pulmonary artery) body temperature were monitored during exercise. 	Sodium chloride administered as described induced plasma volume expansion estimated on the basis of change in plasma protein concentration of 11. 3 ?? 3. 2 % (SE) prior to exercise Protocol 1 and a 15. 5 ?? 1. 1 % (SE) increase prior to Protocol 2. Despite establishing significant hypervolemia, we were unable to demonstrate any effect of pre-exercise <b>hyperhydration</b> on arterial oxygen tension or hemoglobin saturation during either exercise test. Arterial CO 2 tension, blood lactate concentrations, and pH were not affected by pre-exercise <b>hyperhydration.</b> In both exercise protocols, there was a reduction in the ???arterial to mixed-venous blood O 2 content difference??? in the hyperhydrated treatment during much of the exercise protocol, that was likely offset by an increase in cardiac output...|$|E
40|$|During {{athletic}} {{competition or}} recreational pursuits, a body's hydration level can become compromised, {{resulting in a}} decrement in performance. Glycerol (1, 2, 3 -propanetriol) {{has been used to}} induce <b>hyperhydration</b> in an attempt to offset the deleterious effects of dehydration. When glycerol is consumed orally, it is rapidly absorbed primarily in the small intestine. It is reported to be evenly distributed among all fluid compartments, {{with the exception of the}} cerebral spinal fluid and aqueous humour, and promotes <b>hyperhydration</b> by inducing an osmotic gradient. Through an increase in the kidney's medullary concentration gradient, water absorption in the nephron is enhanced. When glycerol is consumed, the plasma glycerol concentration increases in proportion to the dose ingested, which easily exceeds the glycerol saturation point resulting in urinary glycerol excretion. Thus, without supplemental glycerol ingestion, there will be a decrease in the osmotic gradient resulting in a loss of <b>hyperhydration.</b> The ergogenic nature of glycerol has been investigated as to its effect on fluid retention, thermoregulation, cardiovascular responses and performance. While many studies provide evidence of <b>hyperhydration,</b> others do not. Only two studies reviewed showed a thermoregulatory advantage. Furthermore, the preponderance of evidence neither weighed for or against cardiovascular or performance advantages. What makes one study provide favourable results while another study does not is unclear. Possible explanations may include subject characteristics, environmental factors, research design, whether fluids with or without glycerol were given during exercise, the rate at which fluids are initially given to induce <b>hyperhydration,</b> the time between peak hyperhydration/peak plasma glycerol concentration and the trial (i. e. exercise), the glycerol dose (i. e. 1. 0 g/kg body mass) and what it is based upon, the percentage glycerol solution (i. e. 5, 20), the variation of time between the end of the hydration protocol and the beginning of exercise, or perhaps the intensity of exercise (fixed, variable, percentage maximum oxygen uptake). What is clear is that glycerol has the capacity to enhance fluid retention. In so doing, glycerol <b>hyperhydration</b> may be a logistically preferred method due to concomitant decrease in urine output and free-water clearance, which may give a performance advantage by offsetting dehydration. Future research should focus on maintaining plasma glycerol concentrations at levels necessary to maintain osmotic forces required to support continued <b>hyperhydration.</b> Potential benefits of glycerol should be further explored to identify the circumstances or factors that may contribute to an ergogenic effect...|$|E

40|$|Maintenance of euhydration is {{essential}} for maximum work performance. Environments which induce hypohydration reduce plasma volume and cardiovascular performance progressively declines as does work capacity. <b>Hyperhydration</b> prior to exposure to dehydrating environments {{appears to be a}} potential countermeasure to the debilitating effects of hypohydration. The extravascular fluid space, being the largest fluid compartment in the body, is the most logical space by which significant <b>hyperhydration</b> can be accomplished. Volume and osmotic receptors in the vascular space result in physiological responses which counteract <b>hyperhydration.</b> Our hypothesis is that glycerol-induced <b>hyperhydration</b> (GIH) can accomplish extravascular fluid expansion because of the high solubility of glycerol in lipid and aqueous media. A hypertonic solution of glycerol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, results in mild increases in plasma osmolality and is distributed to 65 percent of the body mass. A large volume of water ingested within minutes after glycerol intake results in increased total body water because of the osmotic action and distribution of glycerol. The resulting expanded extravascular fluid space can act as a reservoir to maintain plasma volume during exposure to dehydrating environments. The fluid shifts associated with exposure to microgravity result in increased urine production and is another example of an environment which induces hypohydration. Our goal is to demonstrate that GIH will facilitate maintenance of euhydration and cardiovascular performance during space flight and upon return to a 1 g environment...|$|E

Among the drugs associated with nephrotoxic ARF are the radiologic contrast media whose nephrotoxic effects have grown, following the increasing diagnostic use of these agents. Methods: We evaluated the effect of iodinated contrast (IC) medium, administered in combination, or not, with <b>hyperhydration</b> or N-acetylcysteine (NAC), on creatinine clearance, production of urinary peroxides and renal histology of rats. Adult Wistar rats treated for 5 days were divided into the following groups: control (saline, 3 ml/kg/day, intraperitoneally [i. p. ]), IC (sodium iothalamate meglumine, 3 ml/kg/day i. p.), IC + water (12 mL water, orally + IC, 3 ml/kg/day i. p. after 1 hour), IC + NAC (NAC, 150 mg/kg/day, orally + IC, 3 ml/kg/day i. p. after 1 hour) and IC + water + NAC. Results: IC medium reduced renal function, with maintenance of urinary flow. <b>Hyperhydration</b> did not reduce the nephrotoxic effect of the IC agent, which was observed in the group IC + NAC.

His sodium levels dropped to 118 - 120 [*]mmol/L despite 70 % fluid restriction. For chemotherapy, he required <b>hyperhydration,</b> which posed a challenge because of severe hyponatraemia. Tolvaptan is an oral, highly selective arginine vasopressin V 2 -receptor antagonist, {{which has been}} licensed in adults {{for the management of}} SIADH and has been used in treating paediatric heart failure. Tolvaptan gradually increased sodium levels and allowed liberalisation of fluid intake and <b>hyperhydration.</b> Tolvaptan had profound effects on urinary output in our patient with increases up to 8 [*]mL/kg/h and required close monitoring of fluid balance, frequent sodium measurements and adjustments to intake. After <b>hyperhydration,</b> tolvaptan was stopped, and the lymphoma went into remission with reversal of SIADH. We report one of the first uses of tolvaptan in a child with SIADH, and it was an effective and safe treatment to manage severe SIADH when fluid restriction was not possible or effective. However, meticulous monitoring of fluid balance and sodium levels and adjustments of fluid intake are required to prevent rapid sodium changes. LEARNING POINTS: Tolvaptan can be used in paediatric patients with SIADH to allow <b>hyperhydration</b> during chemotherapy.

40|$|Dehydration in athletes alters {{cardiovascular}} and thermoregulatory {{function and}} may inhibit endurance exercise capacity if fluid loss exceeds 2 % of body-weight (BW). If {{this level of}} dehydration cannot be prevented when starting from a state of euhydration, then athletes may create a state of <b>hyperhydration</b> by consuming extra fluid prior to exercise. From this hyperhydrated situation, individuals have a greater capacity to tolerate fluid loss before becoming dehydrated. Furthermore, excess pre-exercise fluid intake enhances thermoregulatory ability, as well as increasing plasma volume to maintain cardiac output. However, hyperhydrating before exercise is difficult, because a large fluid intake is typically accompanied by diuresis. Glycerol-containing beverages create an osmotic gradient in the circulation favouring fluid retention, thereby facilitating <b>hyperhydration</b> and protecting against dehydration. Many {{studies have shown that}} increases in body water by 1 L or more are achievable through glycerol <b>hyperhydration.</b> This article analyses the evidence for glycerol use in facilitating <b>hyperhydration</b> and rehydration, and provides guidelines for athletes wishing to use this compound. An analysis of the studies in this area indicates that endurance athletes intending to hyperhydrate with glycerol should ingest glycerol 1. 2 g/kg BW in 26 mL/kg BW of fluid over a period of 60 minutes, 30 minutes prior to exercise. The effects of glycerol on total body water when used during rehydration are less well defined, due to the limited studies conducted. However, ingesting glycerol 0. 125 g/kg BW in a volume equal to 5 mL/kg BW during exercise will delay dehydration, while adding glycerol 1. 0 g/kg BW to each 1. 5 L of fluid consumed following exercise will accelerate the restoration of plasma volume.

40|$|The use of {{solutions}} containing creatine and glycerol (Cr/Gly) has become popular amongst athletes {{as a means}} of hyperhydrating prior to exercise in the heat, since achieving an optimal hydration status appears to be a critical factor for temperature and cardiovascular regulation during exercise in the heat. <b>Hyperhydration</b> has previously been achieved by means of a pre-exercise water loading strategy with the use of hydrating agents (i. e., Cr and Gly) in combination. Certain problems are related to this <b>hyperhydration</b> strategy and are investigated in this thesis. Firstly, the use of Gly has been prohibited and added to the WADA banned list due to the potential of Gly plasma expansion properties, to mask the use of doping substances such as erythropoietin stimulants. However, the scientific basis of the inclusion of Gly as a “masking agent” remains inconclusive. Secondly, the addition of high CHO amounts to the Cr/Gly strategy is central to successful Cr uptake and subsequent <b>hyperhydration.</b> Thirdly, high CHO intake has been linked to high plasma TAG in the athletic population and partial replacement of CHO with insulinotropic agents, such as alpha lipoic acid (Ala), a natural antioxidant and co-factor in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, has been shown to enhance Cr uptake under conditions of reduced CHO.

At weekly intervals, 6 trained male subjects ingested, in a randomized, double-blind, counterbalanced fashion, either a glycerol (1. 2 g glycerol/kg bodyweight (BW) with 26 mL/kg BW of water - aspartame-flavored fluid) or placebo solution (water - aspartame-flavored fluid only) over a 2 h period. Subjects then performed 2 h of cycling at 66 % of the maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) and 25 °C while drinking 500 mL/h of sports drink, which {{was followed by a}} step-incremented cycling test to exhaustion. Levels of <b>hyperhydration</b> did not differ significantly between treatments before exercise. During exercise, GIH significantly reduced urine production by 246 mL. GIH did not increase sweat rate nor did it decrease heart rate, rectal temperature, or perceived exertion during exercise as compared with WIH. EP was not significantly different between treatments. Neither treatment induced undesirable side effects. It is concluded that, compared with WIH, GIH decreases urine production, but does not improve cardiovascular or thermoregulatory functions, nor does it improve EP during 2 h of cycling in a 25 °C environment in trained athletes consuming 500 mL/h of fluid during exercise.

40|$|International audienceBackgroundThere is an {{unresolved}} {{debate on}} the best screening method for hematuria as a symptom of glomerulonephritis or urological malignancies. The urinary dipstick is generally considered as an imperfect surrogate for urine microscopy analysis. ResultsWe designed a study to compare urine microscopy analysis, urinary dipstick and flow cytometry, using controlled dilutions of blood in urine samples from volunteers collected in two different physiologically-relevant conditions (basal state and <b>hyperhydration).</b> We found that although all techniques were 100 % effective in detecting hematuria at basal state, these results were variably reproduced when testing the same final amount of hematuria in urine collected after <b>hyperhydration.</b> Our data shows a variable sensitivity {{for the detection of}} hematuria by urine microscopy analysis or flow cytometry, but not by urinary dipstick. ConclusionsUrinary dipstick qualifies as a better screening test for hematuria than urine microscopy analysis or flow cytometry, as it is sensitive and performs better in unstandardized conditions. It is universally available and also faster and cheaper than cytometric techniques...|$|E
40|$|Water {{drinking}} {{reduces the}} occurrence of syncope in healthy volunteers but the effects of <b>hyperhydration</b> are unknown. This study assessed the effects of combined creatine (Cr) and glycerol (Gly) induced <b>hyperhydration</b> on the cardiovascular and haematological responses to postural change. Subjects in all trials lay supine for 30 min before being tilted head-up to 70 &# 176; for a further 30 min or until the limit of their tolerance. Following 2 baseline trials, 19 subjects were matched for body mass and assigned to ingest either 20 g Cr and 2 g Gly kg - 1 body mass (BM) plus 2 l of water or 2 l of water alone (Pl) each day for 6 days and once more 5 h prior to the experimental trial. Subjects ingested 500 ml of water prior to all trials to ensure euhydration. During baseline trials, 3 subjects in the Cr/Gly group and 2 in the Pl group experienced presyncope during head-up tilt. Following Cr/Gly supplementation, BM increased by (mean &# 177; S. D.) 0. 9 &# 177; 0. 3 and total body water (TBW) increased by 0. 7 &# 177; 0. 2 l with {{no change in the}} Pl group. Cr/Gly supplementation resulted in a significant increase in systolic (11 mmHg) and diastolic (7 mmHg) blood pressure during head-up tilt with no change following Pl supplementation. Cr/Gly. Following Cr/Gly supplementation the number of subjects who became presyncopal was reduced from 3 to 1, with no change in the Pl group. These data suggest that <b>hyperhydration</b> mediated by Cr and Gly can enhance orthostatic tolerance in healthy individual...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Bipolar {{transurethral}} resection (TUR) {{has been introduced}} in the clinical practice nowadays. Benefits from bipolar TUR are represented {{by the use of}} saline irrigation, which avoids hypoosmotic <b>hyperhydration</b> (TUR–Syndrome), {{as well as by the}} reduced risk of obturator nerve stimulation. However, the previously introduced smaller bipolar resection loop caused prolonged operating–time.
