5|$|Historically {{regarded}} as a barren, desolate and dangerous to cross, the Pine Bush {{has come to be}} seen as a historical, cultural, and environmental asset to the Capital District and Hudson Valley regions of New York. It is home to the <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly, an endangered species first identified by author Vladimir Nabokov in 1944 using a type specimen from the Pine Bush.|$|E
5|$|The Albany Pine Bush {{is home to}} {{hundreds}} of species of Lepidoptera (moths), including over 40 Noctuidae considered to be pine barrens specialists. The most well-known species in the area is the <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), discovered in the 1940s and named by the author Vladimir Nabokov. The butterfly {{is now on the}} Endangered Species List. Once found in large numbers throughout the grassy openings of the pine barrens, it is today extremely rare and found in a handful of sites. Attempts to reintroduce the butterfly focus on the food and host plant for its larvae – the wild blue lupine, which needs frequent forest fires to maintain its habitat. Other regionally rare butterflies include the dusted skipper (Atrytonopsis hianna), Henry's elfin (Incisalia henrici), frosted elfin (Incisalia irus), and Edward's hairstreak (Satyrium edwardsii). The inland barrens buck moth (Hemileuca maia) is a state-listed special concern animal; and other rare moths include the broad-lined catopyrrha (Catopyrrha coloraria), several noctuid moths (Apharetra purpurea, Chaetaglaea cerata, Chytonix sensilis, Macrochilo bivittata, and Zanclognatha martha), bird dropping moth (Cerma cora), and a geometrid moth (Itame). The Albarufan dagger moth was last seen in the Pine Bush in 1983 and is presumed locally extinct.|$|E

Evidence of different catchability and/or detectability {{of male and female}} <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies led King to suggest calculating male and female population sizes separately. General descriptions of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly rearing methods and translocation/ reintroduction techniques are available.|$|E
50|$|Spiders {{and many}} insects {{are the major}} predators of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies. The seven-spotted lady beetle {{is one of the}} few {{confirmed}} predators of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly larvae. Paper wasps (Polistes spp.), spined soldier bugs, and ants (Formica spp.) have been observed removing larvae, and the ant Monomorium emarginatum has been seen chewing on <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly eggs. There is currently no explanation for the removal of larvae or chewing of eggs by some of the same ant species that tend larvae. Other potential predators of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly larvae include green lacewings, soldier beetles, and damsel bugs. Predators of adult <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies include dragonflies, robber flies, ambush bugs (Phymatidae) and spiders, such as crab spiders. Assassin bugs (Reduviidae) are also likely predators of adult <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies.|$|E

50|$|Wasps are {{the most}} {{commonly}} reported parasitoids of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies. A tachinid fly, Aplomya theclarum, has also been listed as a <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly parasite. Two wasps, one from the Trichogrammatidae family and another tentatively identified {{as a member of}} the Eulophidae family, are suspected to parasitize <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly eggs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> {{butterflies}} {{are dependent}} on heterogeneous habitat as it provides the varied requirements of different <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly broods, sexes, and life stages {{over a wide range}} of environmental conditions. Research at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore led to recommendations for canopy openings for adult males and nectaring of both sexes, as well as areas with 30-60% cover for ovipositing females. In the Allegan State Game Area, wild lupine patches occupied by <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies had higher density of edge habitats that unoccupied wild lupine patches. In west-central Wisconsin the importance of shaded habitat led to a recommendation that 20% to 40% of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly habitat provide shaded lupine and that 1/3 have >60% canopy cover with succession in these dense areas allowed to progress to complete closure. Maxwell also suggests avoiding any management that would result in habitat homogenization. The <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly recovery team mentions the importance {{of a wide range of}} aspects, hydrology, microtopography as well canopy cover (0-90%) in conserving the <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly. However, <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> populations can persist in relatively homogenous habitats. For instance, a population has persisted at the Saratoga Airport in New York in open habitat maintained by regular mowing. More information on the habitat characteristics, environmental conditions, and/or geographic variability in habitat requirements that facilitate <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly's persistence in these areas is needed.|$|E
50|$|According to {{reviews and}} general field observations, {{management}} {{activities that are}} typically harmful to <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies include management that increases deer and/or grouse populations, close-cropped grazing, frequent or poorly-timed mowing, plowing, use of herbicides that kill lupine or nectar plants, and use of pesticides that are detrimental to <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies, ants they associate with, or pollinators of species they use for nectar. Information on the impacts of an insecticide on <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies and some herbicides on <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies as well as lupine and nectar species are available. According to the <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly recovery plan, management activities that can have a detrimental effect should be timed to allow at least 2 generations between repeat treatments and, if possible, critical subpopulations should be divided into discrete management units.|$|E

50|$|Given their {{typically}} short dispersal distance, {{the spatial}} arrangement of habitat {{is important to}} the conservation of the <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly. Distance between the various types of habitat required by <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies is likely an influential landscape attribute. Lane suggests that suitable <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly habitat occurs in areas where open and closed canopies occur within a 590-foot (180 m) diameter. Maxwell recommends considering the amount of shaded wild lupine habitat within the dispersal distance of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly when reducing overstory. Many investigators stress the importance of habitat patches being closely spaced. For instance, at sites in west-central Wisconsin, the average distance from an occupied wild lupine patch to another occupied patch was significantly (p=0.002) shorter (709 feet, 216 m) than to an unoccupied patch (1,155 feet, 352 m). Wild lupine patches in the same area that were occupied by <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies were also surrounded by a relatively low percentage of unoccupied patches. In addition, wild lupine patches in the Allegan State Game Area that were occupied by <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies were closer to other occupied patches than wild lupine patches without <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies. This led to the recommendation that habitat patches be within 230 feet (70 m) of each other. Isolation of habitat patches has been suggested as a reason for lack of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly presence on sites in New York. In addition, studies of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly dispersal have led to recommended distance between patches of ≤980 feet (300 m) to allow for dispersal and management units no wider than 1,300 to 1,600 feet (400-500 m) to improve recolonization of treated areas.|$|E
50|$|Many {{other factors}} may {{influence}} the quality of wild lupine (Lupinus perennis) as a <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly food resource. At Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, wild lupine with <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly feeding damage had significantly larger leaves and longer and thicker stems than plants without feeding damage. In addition, larval length was positively associated with wild lupine height in central Wisconsin. Higher nitrogen concentrations in wild lupine leaves resulted in significantly shorter larval durations in a feeding trial. In 1995, in west-central Wisconsin, significantly more <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly larvae were observed in oak-pine barren plots where mildew infection was delayed compared to areas where wild lupine were infected earlier. However, in a feeding trial larval duration of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies fed mildew-infected wild lupine was {{not significantly different from}} treatments that resulted in the shortest larval durations. <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly fed water-stressed wild lupine had significantly longer larval durations than many treatments including larvae fed flowering wild lupine, shade-grown wild lupine in seed, or mildew-infected wild lupine. Although <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies have been shown to benefit from their association with ants, wild lupine with <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly larvae in the Allegan State Game Area in Michigan were not detectably closer to ant hills than wild lupine without caterpillars.|$|E
5000|$|Nectar {{availability}} {{is likely}} to influence <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly abundance. In a right-of-way in west-central Wisconsin, the frequency that <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies stayed in an area between recaptures was significantly (p<0.05) positively related to percent cover of nectar flowers such as Canadian horseweed (Conyza canadensis var. canadensis) and spotted beebalm (Monarda punctata). Preliminary results from a study in southeastern Minnesota suggest that openings where <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies were detected tended to have more flowering nectar species. In Michigan, more <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies were observed on sites with more nectaring plants, especially butterfly milkweed (Asclepias tuberosa). As discussed in Canopy cover, nectar species increase in open habitats. For instance, at Fort McCoy in west-central Wisconsin, all the nectar species listed for <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies require either full or partial sun. In addition, treatments such as cutting with or without herbicides, herbicide application alone, or mowing at varying intervals resulted in a significant (p<0.01) {{increase in the number}} and cover of nectar species. See section [...] "Food habits" [...] for species that <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies use as nectar sources.|$|E
50|$|A {{wide range}} of values related to <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> {{butterfly}} recruitment have been reported. Adult <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> sex ratios vary from 1 male to 1.44 females to 2 males to 1 female. Wild caught <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly females have been observed to lay from 7.7 to 83 eggs on average. Reported percentages of eggs that reach adulthood under controlled conditions vary from 21.4% to 75.2%. In the wild, loss of eggs may be substantial.|$|E
50|$|<b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> {{butterflies}} {{are directly}} affected by temperature. A laboratory investigation of temperature on <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly found that flight typically begins at 76 °F (24.6 °C) for females and 80 °F (26.4 °C) for males (p=0.25). Signs of heat stress started at 96 °F (35.6 °C) for females and 98 °F (36.8 °C) for males (p=0.25). In pine-oak barrens in Wisconsin, observation rates of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies increased significantly (p=0.000) with increasing temperature.|$|E
50|$|<b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> {{butterfly}} larvae {{benefit from}} a , mutualistic relationship with several ant species. In pitch pine-bear oak (Pinus rigida-Quercus ilicifolia) habitat in New York, significantly more larvae tended by ants survived (67%) than untended larvae (38%). The 19 ant species tending <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly larvae were from the subfamilies Formicinae, Myrmicinae, and Dolichoderinae, which {{are the most common}} in the area. The species of ant is likely to influence the degree of benefit gained by <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly larvae. At sites in Wisconsin and Minnesota, ant tending rates increased significantly with increasing larval age. The <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> larvae also has fine hairs on it to protect itself. In a study of the effect of different experimental feeding treatments, <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly larvae tended by ants had one of the shortest observed larval durations and gained the most weight for the amount of lupine eaten.|$|E
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{management}} techniques can be compatible with maintaining <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly populations when {{attention is paid to}} implementing them at appropriate times and at intensities, scales, and frequencies that <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies can tolerate. For example, mowing can maintain open areas with little to no detrimental effect on <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies on sites where burning is impractical or in areas too small to support populations of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies likely to survive a burn. On restored oak savanna sites in south-central Wisconsin, no significant (p=0.924) differences were detected between <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly densities on sites burned in summer, sites mowed in August, and control sites. Mowing with a blade height >4 inches (10 cm) should be performed annually or biennially in the fall or winter and clippings should be left in place. Effects of mowing, burning, and other management techniques and land uses on the average number of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies observed per survey hour are included in. Recommendations on the use {{of a wide range of}} management techniques such as thinning, rotational grazing, and planting of wild lupine and/or nectar species can be found in.|$|E
50|$|<b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> {{butterflies}} {{have two}} broods per year, following wild lupine (Lupinus perennis) phenology quite closely. Eggs laid by <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies {{in late summer}} overwinter and hatch in mid- to late April. Development from egg through four larval instars and pupation takes from 25 to 60 days. The average lifespan of adult <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies has been reported at between 3 and 5 days. The first <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly flight generally occurs sometime between mid-May and mid-June, with males typically appearing earlier than females. First flight females lay {{the vast majority of}} their eggs on wild lupine. These eggs develop into the adults of the second <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly flight, which generally occurs in July and August. Although always near a wild lupine plant, second brood females lay more eggs on grasses, other plants, and litter than 1st brood females. The 2nd flight is typically two to four {{times the size of the}} first flight. However, the first flight of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies can be larger than the second. Timing and size of both flights can exhibit substantial variation, depending on local weather conditions among other factors.|$|E
50|$|In west-central Wisconsin, {{the amount}} of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> {{butterfly}} larval feeding damage increased with grass cover. A review suggests that grass cover may provide roosting sites for <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies and that 5% cover of tall grass would most likely meet this need.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> {{butterfly}} {{occurs in}} isolated {{populations in the}} Miller section of Gary, Indiana, eastern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan, and New York. Reintroductions have been initiated in Ohio and New Hampshire. The <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly appears extirpated from Iowa, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Maine, and Ontario.|$|E
50|$|Wild lupine is {{the sole}} larval food source of the <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly. Adult <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> {{butterflies}} obtain nectar from several native and nonnative species. <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies have been reported feeding on the nectar of 41 different species in a single study in west-central Wisconsin. Broods differ significantly in the species used for nectaring, likely {{due to differences in}} their phenology. Several blackberries have been documented as food sources for the spring brood, while spotted beebalm, white sweetclover (Melilotus alba), and flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), are widely cited sources of nectar in the summer. Common cinquefoil (Potentilla simplex) is used as a nectar species for both broods. <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies' preferred nectar species may include butterfly weed in New York and Michigan and lyrate rockcress (Arabis lyrata), lanceleaf tickseed (Coreopsis lanceolata), white sweetclover, and northern dewberry (Rubus flagellaris) at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Differences in nectar species used between male and female <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies and across locations have been reported. Other often mentioned nectar sources include New Jersey tea (Ceanothus americanus), wild lupine, goldenrods (Solidago spp.), and spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa).|$|E

50|$|Temperature also {{influences}} <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly phenology and brood success. Weather {{had strong}} influence on <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly phenology at Fort McCoy in west-central Wisconsin. In a cool year the 2nd-brood flight began 6 June, {{while in a}} warmer year adults were 1st detected on 22 May. In addition, compared to the previous year the flight of the 2nd-brood during the hot year was shortened by 20 days. At Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, evidence suggests that cool winters negatively impact 1st-brood populations and cool summers positively affect 2nd-brood populations. A review suggests that the cover provided by snowpack protects <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly eggs from hatching prematurely or being overheated by direct sunlight. Therefore, short periods of continuous snow cover due to site conditions or mild winters could result in decreased occurrence or smaller populations of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> {{butterflies}} may {{be associated}} with disturbance. Although results may have been biased by a significant (p=0.009) positive correlation (r=0.2173) between patch area and number of disturbances (such as burning, vehicle traffic, and thinning and clearing), patches in a right-of-way in west-central Wisconsin occupied by <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies had a greater frequency of disturbance than unoccupied patches (p≤0.0125). In the same area, the abundance of the <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly spring brood was positively related to trails, and the percent of lupine stems with larval feeding damage was significantly (p<0.05) greater in areas disturbed by military vehicle traffic.|$|E
5000|$|Heterogeneity is an {{important}} feature of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly habitat. Specific recommendations regarding the spatial arrangement of the various required habitat types and <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly habitat patches are discussed in Landscape effects. Creation and rotation of management units should incorporate this information as well as data on <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly movement (see section [...] "Timing of major life history events"). Bidwell recommends management units be a maximum of 1,300 to 1,600 feet (400-500 m) wide to improve recolonization from neighboring areas. Depending on the available and surrounding habitat, managing for heterogeneity could mean implementing {{a wide range of}} techniques.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presence}} of dispersal corridors may assist with <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly dispersal. <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies appear to disperse further in open habitats (see section [...] "Timing of major life history events"). However, there is uncertainty regarding {{what constitutes a}} corridor or a barrier to dispersal. Creation of corridors with both lupine for larvae and nectar species for adults {{may be useful in}} connecting habitat patches.|$|E
50|$|According to reviews, {{habitat loss}} through direct {{conversion}} to {{other land uses}} and through succession are considered the major causes {{of the decline of}} the <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly. At the time of this writing (2006), two reviews summarize the recent status of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly across its range. Recovery criteria are addressed by, while Christenson and Lentz discuss lessons learned developing a statewide Habitat Conservation Plan for Wisconsin.|$|E
5000|$|Size {{of habitat}} patches can also {{influence}} <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly abundance (see section [...] "Wild lupine"). At the Allegan State Game Area, wild lupine patches occupied by <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies were larger than unoccupied patches. This {{was also the}} case at Fort McCoy in Wisconsin. In addition {{to the effect of}} amount of wild lupine, a review suggests that it is easier to maintain <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly habitat in larger patches. Lane notes the need to find a balance between having patches of different required habitats within the activity range of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies and having open areas large enough that they do not become shaded too quickly. Canopy openings with diameters of at least 82 feet (25 m) were recommended based on research at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, and research in Wisconsin and Minnesota led to a recommended opening size of 1.5 times the height of adjacent trees. According to a review, subpopulations in habitat patches of less than 0.25 ha (0.62 acres) are vulnerable to extirpation.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> {{butterflies}} {{are characteristic}} of oak savannas (Quercus spp.) and pine barrens (Pinus spp.) habitats, they also occur in frequently disturbed areas such as rights-of-way, old fields, and road margins. In east-central New York, <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies occurred in 3 rights-of-way habitat types: wild lily-of-the-valley-starflower (Maianthemum canadensis-Trientalis borealis), sweetfern-whorled yellow loosestrife (Comptonia peregrina-Lysimachia quadrifolia), and blackberry-sheep sorrel (Rubus spp. Rumex acetosella). An index of <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> population size was highest in the wild lily-of-the-valley-starflower type. In this habitat, mosses (Bryophyta, 6.9%), wild lily-of-the-valley (4.4%), grasses (Poaceae, 4.4%), and starflower (2.1%) had the highest cover. Coverage in the sweetfern-whorled yellow loosestrife type was dominated by grasses (40.9%), sweetfern (12.1%), mosses (9.4%), and whorled yellow loosestrife (5.2%). In the blackberry-sheep sorrel type, the dominants included grasses (22.7%), northern dewberry (Rubus flagellaris, 5.0%), other blackberries (4.8%), and sheep sorrel (4.3%).|$|E
50|$|Several {{studies have}} found a {{positive}} relationship between measures of wild lupine and <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly abundance. However, available evidence suggests that senescent wild lupine is a poor larval food source. The effects of other phenological stages are more ambiguous. In west-central Wisconsin, <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly abundance was negatively associated with the abundance of reproductive lupine and positively related with the frequency of immature wild lupine. However, a feeding trial found that <b>Karner</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly fed 1st year wild lupine had one of the lowest survival rates observed and significantly longer larval durations than larvae fed older wild lupine that did not flower, was flowering, had recently flowered, or was grown in shade and was in seed. In addition, on sites in Wisconsin and Minnesota, the number of 1st flight oviposition sites on nonreproductive and reproductive wild lupine was similar.|$|E
