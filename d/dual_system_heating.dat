Conditions which may hinder or preclude proper implementation include shallow bedrock, high water table, and insufficient space, among others. In some areas, only cooling or heating may be afforded by earth-air heat exchangers. In these areas, provision for thermal recharge of the ground must especially be considered. In <b>dual</b> function <b>systems</b> (both <b>heating</b> and cooling), the warm season provides ground thermal recharge for the cool season and the cool season provides ground thermal recharge for the warm season, though overtaxing the thermal reservoir must be considered even with <b>dual</b> function <b>systems.</b>|$|R

These efforts were focused primarily toward thermal energy storage space heating and <b>dual</b> fuel <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> [5]. American Electric Power Company (AEP) pioneered thermal energy storage systems in the U.S. by commercializing and promoting a central storage furnace developed by Creda Electric Ltd. of the UK. Other utilities including Green Mountain Power and Central Vermont Public Service followed suit by offering rate structures and promotional programs intended to accelerate adoption of these technologies. Dual-fuel heating was popularized by Minnkota Power Cooperative and consisted of large, well-insulated water heaters which could use electricity during off-peak periods and fossil fuels at other times.|$|R

40|$|To {{examine the}} level of {{consistency}} of different poststratification variables in classifying housing units to categories of interest on two different address listings. While this study focuses on inconsistency of housing units in the census, a similar study to this one was conducted on persons in the census (Farber and Davis, 2001). 2 <b>Dual</b> <b>System</b> Estimation The Census Bureau used <b>dual</b> <b>system</b> estimation to measure the coverage of housing units in Census 2000.

The <b>dual</b> <b>system</b> estimation process involves using both of these components to produce coverage estimates. See <b>dual</b> <b>system</b> estimation formula in Barrett (2001).
