5|$|Nelson {{has been}} arrested several times for {{marijuana}} possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late {{to the airport and}} boarded the flight without luggage. The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of <b>his</b> <b>jeans.</b> Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1964 and 1965, Dylan moved from folk {{songwriter}} to folk-rock pop-music star. <b>His</b> <b>jeans</b> and work shirts were replaced by a Carnaby Street wardrobe, sunglasses day or night, and pointed [...] "Beatle boots". A London reporter wrote: [...] "Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square. He looks like an undernourished cockatoo." [...] Dylan began to spar with interviewers. Appearing on the Les Crane television show and asked about a movie he planned, he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie. Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied, [...] "No, I play my mother." ...|$|E
500|$|Crash {{served as}} a mascot for Sony Computer Entertainment from his {{creation}} until September 2000 when Universal Interactive Studios and Konami entered an agreement that would enable Konami to publish a Crash Bandicoot game (which would later become [...] ) for next-generation game systems, with Universal Interactive handling {{the production of the}} games; the agreement served to break the Crash Bandicoot franchise's exclusivity to Sony-produced consoles and effectively made Crash Bandicoot a mascot character for Universal rather than Sony. Crash's game model in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex was composed of approximately 1,800 polygons, which allowed an increase in detail compared to past models, including a more complex and realistic tuft of hair, a visible uvula, stitching on <b>his</b> <b>jeans</b> and shoes and a designer label on his pants.|$|E

5000|$|The team {{gets its}} unusual name after [...] "Ripknee", a {{character}} in stories (with {{a hole in the}} knee of <b>his</b> blue <b>jeans)</b> which former co-owner John Jurewicz used to tell his son, William (also a former co-owner) on long car trips. The team ceased operations after 2008.|$|R

500|$|Wiseau {{has said}} that while casting the film, he {{selected}} his group of actors from among [...] "thousands" [...] of head shots, yet nearly the entire cast of The Room {{had never before been}} in a full-length film. For example, The Room was the first film in which Carolyn Minnott had ever appeared. Greg Sestero, who had known Wiseau for some time before production began, had limited film experience and had only agreed to work with Wiseau as part of the production crew. On the first day of filming, Wiseau fired the actor originally hired to play Mark, and Sestero agreed to fill in. He would later admit to being uncomfortable filming his sex scenes; because of this, he was allowed to keep <b>his</b> <b>jeans</b> on while shooting them.|$|E
500|$|Although Churchill's, {{described}} by Lewington as [...] "the worst club {{that has ever}} been in Reading", tolerated such behaviour, the town's fashionable Sindlesham Mill nightclub did not, regularly barring Friday for his bizarre activities, including a dance he invented called [...] "the elephant" [...] which consisted of turning the pockets of <b>his</b> <b>jeans</b> inside out and undoing his flies to expose himself. He and his friends would regularly drink all day, though {{he was able to}} exert some self-control; according to his friend Syd Simmonds, Friday would obey Hurley's instruction not to drink for 48 hours before each game. However, he would play his prized heavy metal records very loudly at any time of the day or night and take LSD with casual indifference. Hurley attempted to calm Friday down by moving him into an apartment above the football club's elderly ex-groundsman, but to no avail: [...] "Even if it was three in the morning, the first thing would be to get the music playing", Simmonds later said. [...] "We had an old boy living below us ... the ex-groundsman at Reading. He was coming up to 80 and he had a dog's life in the flat. Pounding music, people knocking on the door, girls throwing stones at the windows. Poor old sod." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} the sound of a {{motorcycle}} engine. Bob Dylan's [...] "Gotta Serve Somebody" [...] is delivered, according to Parke Puterbaugh of Rolling Stone, with [...] "the air of Old Testament-style authority it demands". James does not modify the lyrics, singing [...] "You can call me Bobby, you can call me Zimmy". [...] "Don't Let My Baby Ride", originally by Deadric Malone and O. V. Wright, adds a bit of sensuality to the album with the line: [...] "If <b>his</b> <b>jeans</b> are too tight... you might see what you like". Other covers include Al Green's [...] "Rhymes", [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] (Jimmy Campbell and Reg Connelly, Harry M. Woods), and Otis Redding [...] "Hawg for Ya". The tempo of The Rolling Stones' [...] "Miss You" [...] is slowed down to a [...] "sensual simmer". James modified the gender mentioned in the lyrics, singing [...] "Puerto Rican boys just dying to meet you". Following [...] "Hawg" [...] are Malone's [...] "You're Gonna Make Me Cry", which features vocals by Finnigan, Sandy Jones' [...] "Walking the Back Streets", and Benny Latimore's [...] "Let's Straighten It Out". Closing the album are John Fogerty's [...] "Born on the Bayou", [...] "Come Back Baby" [...] (Ray Charles, Lightnin' Hopkins), and Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller's [...] "Hound Dog".|$|E
50|$|Staying {{ahead of}} fashion counterfeiters who aped his {{signature}} and sold cheaper versions of his clothes, Kani began fastening a metal-and-leather plate to his product.

2500|$|In November 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit {{reviewed}} {{the case in}} light of new DNA evidence that might exonerate House. [...] The DNA taken from semen on the victim's clothing matched her husband, and not House. [...] Additionally, House advanced {{the theory that the}} blood found on <b>his</b> <b>jeans</b> was spilled onto them from autopsy samples while the evidence was being transported from Tennessee to the FBI crime lab. [...] Two witnesses came forward to say that the victim's husband, Hubert Muncey, had confessed to the murder.|$|E
2500|$|The {{resulting}} album, Outside the Gate (1988), is Killing Joke's {{most controversial}} album, {{due to its}} synth-led sonics and disagreement over {{the quality of the}} material. Sounds said of the album: [...] "It's a stodgy, inconclusive LP that fails in all but the most basic of senses to achieve its end, leaving us feeling soured and unimpressed". NME shared the same point of view and depicted it as [...] "a private breakfast of ideas, depicting poor old Jaz wading through quicksand with <b>his</b> <b>jeans</b> rolled down yet again. Worse ... he seems to be wandering off in exactly the same direction". Outside the Gate strays from Killing Joke's signature sound, being built around Coleman's orchestral keyboards instead of Geordie's distinctive guitar riffs, which were all but drowned out in the final mix. Two singles, [...] "America" [...] and [...] "My Love of This Land", were released from the album but did little to improve its fortunes. The video for the former song featured Coleman and Geordie with Copley and session bassist Jerome Rimson, who never actually recorded with the band. Virgin dropped the group two months after the release of the album; it also marked the end of their collaboration with the E.G. label.|$|E
5000|$|Levi Strauss ( [...] , born Löb Strauß, February 26, 1829 - September 26, 1902) was a German-American {{businessman}} {{who founded the}} first company to manufacture blue <b>jeans.</b> <b>His</b> firm, Levi Strauss & Co., began in 1853 in San Francisco, California.|$|R
25|$|Originally {{known for}} coming to council {{meetings}} in blue jeans with unkempt hair, Layton worked to change his image {{to run for mayor}} in the 1991 civic election. He also started wearing contact lenses, abandoning his glasses, and traded in <b>his</b> blue <b>jeans</b> for suits. In February 1991, Layton became the first official NDP candidate for the mayoralty, pitting him against centrist incumbent Art Eggleton. In a move that surprised many, Eggleton elected not to run again.|$|R
5000|$|According to Cotton Incorporated [...] "Neil Diamond {{might have}} been right when he named his 1979 #1 hit “Forever in Blue Jeans”: 81% of women are {{planning}} their next jeans purchase to be some shade of blue." [...] The song {{has been used to}} promote the sale of blue jeans, most notably Will Ferrell, impersonating Neil Diamond singing, for The Gap. Coincidentally, Diamond himself did radio ads for <b>H.I.S.</b> brand <b>jeans</b> in the 1960s, more than a decade before he sang this song.|$|R

'Say, I got something to be fresh about!' he says to me. And then he reaches into <b>his</b> <b>jeans</b> and hauls out the sparkler. 'What's that?' I says to him. 'It's an engagement ring,' he says to me. 'For you, if you'll wear it!' I came over so weak, I could have fell!

He says to me 'Now, I ain't got a job, but I'm going to pull off a stunt to-night that's going to mean enough to me to start that health-farm I've told you about.' Say, he's always had a line of talk about starting a health-farm down on Long Island, he knowing all about training and health and everything through having been one of them fighters.

5000|$|He is most remembered, in the UK, for his 1985 {{performance}} in Levi's [...] "Launderette" [...] television commercial, where he strips down to stone-wash <b>his</b> blue <b>jeans</b> in a 1950s style public laundromat while he waits clad {{only in his}} boxer shorts, {{which was one of}} a series of Bartle Bogle Hegarty advertisements that dramatically increased the popularity of Levi 501s.

60|$|By and by Straw-top {{comes down}} again, and I {{crossed the street}} to meet him, for I had my ideas. Yes, sir, when I got close I could see where he {{overdone}} it. He was Reub all right as far as <b>his</b> blue <b>jeans</b> and cowhide boots went, {{but he had a}} matinee actor's hands, and the rye straw stuck over his ear looked like it belonged to the property man of the Old Homestead Co. Curiosity to know what his graft was got the best of me.|$|R
50|$|When {{the song}} was within the Top 50 in the UK Singles Chart, Mercury Records had the band record a {{performance}} for BBC’s Top of the Pops, provided that the song advanced the following week. However, the song slipped off the charts, and the video never aired. It is, however, included in the band's video Historia. What makes this video unique is that Rick Allen’s drum kit {{is placed in the}} front of the stage, while the rest of the band performs behind him. Joe is wearing a patriotic outfit because of the red and white striped shirt and <b>his</b> blue <b>jeans.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Gosnell {{reflected}} for the London Free Press in 1986 {{that his}} opinionated side {{comes from his}} father. [...] During his university years when he let his hair grow long and wore peace patches on the pockets of <b>his</b> blue <b>jeans,</b> {{the father and son}} did not get along famously. In his university years Gosnell challenged authority, turning $2 parking tickets into 14-dollar summonses until one day the police arrived at his father's home on Wharncliffe Road South when Fred pulled Tom out of bed by the ankles one morning to find out why the police were at the door.|$|R
