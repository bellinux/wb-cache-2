25|$|<b>Higher</b> <b>lift</b> allows greater airflow; {{although}} even {{by allowing}} a larger volume of air to pass thru the larger opening, the brevity {{of the typical}} duration with a <b>higher</b> <b>lift</b> cam results in less airflow than with a cam with lower lift but more duration, all else being equal. On forced induction motors this <b>higher</b> <b>lift</b> could yield better results than longer duration, particularly on the intake side. Notably though, <b>higher</b> <b>lift</b> has more potential problems than increased duration, in particular as valve train rpm rises which can result in less efficient running or loss of torque.|$|R

40|$|Major {{results and}} {{findings}} of the numerical work package of the European <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> programme EUROLIFT are outlined. The main objective of these studies is to validate and test numerical methods for the prediction of <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> flows for transport aircraft configurations. The activities comprise the assessment of current CFD methods for 3 D flows, evaluation of means for code improvement, and transition prediction. All aspects are especially devoted to <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> flow problems. A general capability to predict maximum lift on a simplified wing/fuselage <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> configuration is demonstrated {{by a variety of}} different numerical approaches. In general, major shortcomings are the reliability and the accurate simulation of large separation areas and the turn-around time to compute 3 D lift polars. Advanced turbulence modelling and numerical solver features, such as the preconditioning technique, show a potential to overcome these deficiencies. Promising results with respect to transition prediction were obtained on a swept <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> wing using a database method. The results obtained in the numerical activities represent major ingredients {{on the way to a}} consistent numerical approach for the simulation of transport aircraft <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> configurations including all maximum lift determining effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{advanced}} <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> systems on aircraft size, performance, {{direct operating cost}} and noise were evaluated for short-to-medium and medium-to-long range aircraft with high bypass ratio and very high bypass ratio engines. The benefit of advanced <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> systems in reducing noise {{was found to be}} less than 1 effective-perceived-noise decibel level (EPNdB) when the aircraft were sized to minimize takeoff gross weight. These aircraft did, however, have smaller wings and lower engine thrusts for the same mission than aircraft with conventional <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> systems. When the advanced <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> system was implemented without reducing wing size and simultaneously using lower flap angles that provide higher L/D at approach a cumulative noise reduction of as much as 4 EPNdB was obtained. Comparison of aircraft configurations that have similar approach speeds showed cumulative noise reduction of 2. 6 EPNdB that is purely the result of incorporating advanced <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> system in the aircraft design...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> system for the NASA {{advanced}} LFC airfoil designed by Pfenninger is described. The <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> system consists of both leading and trailing edge flaps. A 3 meter semispan, 1 meter chord wing model using the above airfoil and <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> system is under construction and will be tested in the NASA Langley 4 by 7 meter tunnel. This model will have two separate full span leading edge flaps (0. 10 c and 0. 12 c) and one full span trailing edge flap (0. 25 c).

40|$|Future {{high-lift}} systems must achieve improved aerodynamic {{performance with}} simpler designs that involve fewer elements and reduced maintenance costs. To expeditiously achieve this, reliable CFD design tools are required. The development of useful CFD-based design tools for <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> systems requires increased attention to unresolved flow physics issues. The {{complex flow field}} over any multi-element airfoil may {{be broken down into}} certain generic component flows which are termed high-lift building block flows. In this report a broad spectrum of key flow field physics issues relevant to the design of improved <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> systems are considered. It is demonstrated that in-flight experiments utilizing the NASA Dryden Flight Test Fixture (which is essentially an instrumented ventral fin) carried on an F- 15 B support aircraft can provide a novel and cost effective method by which both Reynolds and Mach number effects associated with specific <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> building block flows can be investigated. These in-flight <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> building block flow experiments are most effective when performed in conjunction with coordinated ground based wind tunnel experiments in low speed facilities. For illustrative purposes three specific examples of in-flight <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> building block flow experiments capable of yielding a high payoff are described. The report concludes with a description of a joint wind tunnel/flight test approach to <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> aerodynamics research...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> systems for {{commercial}} aircraft has a substantial potential {{to contribute to}} the achievements of the challenging goals formulated in the European Vision for 2020. Basically, efficient innovative <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> devices are the pre-requisite for improvements in two fields: the first is the reduction of the perceived aircraft noise, as the airframe, more precisely the slat, has become the main source of noise during the landing phase. The second field is the strong reduction of CO 2 emissions. Whatever advanced aerodynamic concept is considered, the objective is to achieve a reduced perceived noise level for the airport and its residents while sustaining or improving the <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> performance itself, e. g. by means of flow control. High fidelity numerical methods together with a detailed understanding of the <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> flow physics and scaling effects are key issues to accomplish the envisaged improvements...|$|R
40|$|The <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> {{systems of}} modern-day {{commercial}} airplanes are highly effective systems providing the required lift during take-off and approach at low flight velocities. State-of-the-art <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> systems consist of movable control surfaces which when deployed increase <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> performance. Typical devices are slats and fowler flaps which consist of rigid parts supported and driven by complex mechanical systems. To achieve the goals {{defined in the}} “Vision 2020 ”, technologies to consequently reduce drag and airframe noise will be necessary. In this context especially the <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> systems {{at the leading edge}} are of major interest. Most experts agree that laminarisation is the only technology which has the potential for step changes in drag reduction within a suitable ti-meframe. But this technology requires high quality surfaces and does not comply with conventional <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> devices like slats. Because of the gap which forms between the slat and the main wing the flow is disturbed and causes transition to turbulent flow immediately after the slat gap. Additionally, the construction space in the next generation high aspect ratio wings is limited due to the employ-ment of slim profiles. Furthermore in recent research programs the slat gap is identified {{to be one of the}} most dominant airframe noise sources in take-off and approach. Therefore smart seamless and gapless <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> devices especially at the wings leading edge are a mandatory enabler for futu-re wings of significantly increased aerodynamic efficiency. In the european project SADE and the national project SmartLED gap- and seamless <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> devices for next generation wings are de-signed. The work presented is based on the initial design of an adaptive leading edge device in these projects and focused on the optimization of such a system regarding issues of shape accura-cy in cruise flight as well as in approach and strength requirements...|$|R

The gap between the wing trailing edge and the flap influences the aerodynamic performance of the <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> system distinctly. A variation of the flap gap due to a change of the wing load affects the flow of the flap, especially as far as flow separation is concerned. Thus gap variation has to be considered for a complete analysis of the flow characteristics of the flaps...|$|R
