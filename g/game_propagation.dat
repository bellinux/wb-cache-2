Races and regattas are held {{over the course of}} the summers. Sailboats, rowboats, kayaks, motorboats, canoes, and pontoon boats are available to rent in the Crescent Bay Area. There are two fueling points for power boats. Tenants pay to keep boats at the park's two marinas. Davis Hollow houses both pontoons and sailboats, while Watts Bay houses sailboats and catamarans. Both marinas are on the North Shore. All boats must have a current registration from any state or a launch permit from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The lake is open to ice boating during the winter months. Ice boats must display a state park launch permit.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} amateur sports once dominated {{and controlled by}} Pennsylvania's Leisure Class became accessible to non-elites {{over the course of}} the twentieth century. Rising standards of living and increased leisure time were pre-requisites for broader public participation. But this study argues that the democratization of amateur sport depended on the active intervention of the state and, to a lesser extent, the market, both of which broadened access to privately controlled playing fields. In hunting, state game management restored wild game populations, thus ensuring a bountiful supply of game for all Pennsylvanians, irrespective of social class. Likewise, the first municipally owned golf courses, often situated in public parks, offered the only alternative to the private courses which up to that point dominated the game and regulated participation. Finally, the market-driven demand for new sources of "football material" on college campuses opened opportunities for working-class student athletes, most of whom were recruited and subsidized by wealthy alumni. Many of these changes were set in motion by elites acting in their own self interest. Over time, though, the democratization of amateur sports became a goal in itself. During the 1910 s, the state game commission shifted its emphasis from <b>game</b> <b>propagation</b> and game law enforcement to the acquisition of public game lands, a policy focus which benefited hunters without access to private property. In golf, a second wave of municipal courses, many billed as "people's country clubs" and fortified by federal money, were designed to be accessible to the greatest number of people, and without the membership restrictions which obtained at many early public courses. While the social composition of amateur sports continued to expand after World War II, the market played an increasingly more visible role in that process, as evinced by growth of semi-public golf courses and the increased prevalence of leased or privately owned hunting grounds. Elites frequently responded to the "crowding of the playing fields" by retreating or refortifying boundaries within these same sports...|$|E

Most of these studies approximate a greedy based sub-optimal solution by proving the submodular nature of the utility function. Instead of using the analytical techniques, {{we are interested in}} solving the diffusion competition and influence maximization problem by a data-driven approach. We propose Information <b>Propagation</b> <b>Game</b> (IPG), a framework that can collect a large number of seed picking strategies for analysis. Through the IPG framework, human players are not only having fun but also helping contributing the seed picking strategies.

The policy of these permits is developed by the Division of Migratory Bird Management while the actual permits are issued by the Regional Bird Permit Offices. Permits are issued to those who wish to possess eagles for conducting lawful activities or to those who may disturb an eagles' nest due to lawful activity for human safety or the safety of the birds. Issuance of a permit is based on the activity being conducted {{that may or may not}} be qualified. The following activities qualify for a permit: falconry, raptor propagation, scientific collection, Indian religious purposes, take of depredating birds, taxidermy, waterfowl sale and disposal.

40|$|Abstract — Large-scale {{agent-based}} simulation {{has been}} shown to be an effective tool for understanding a variety of complex systems, such as market economies, war <b>games,</b> and epidemic <b>propagation</b> models. As systems of interest grow in complexity, it is often desirable to support different categories of artificial agents that execute tasks on widely varying time scales. The scalability of a simulation environment becomes a crucial measure of its ability to handle the complexity of the underlying system. In this paper, we present a design for a highly scalable architecture for multi-resolution agent-based simulation. SAMAS is a dynamic data-driven application system (DDDAS) that allows large numbers of heterogeneous agents to operate across a wide range of time scales without unnecessarily compromising simulation runtime. This is accomplished through the use of gossiping, an efficient broadcasting communication model for maintaining the overall consistency of the simulation environment.

40|$|Abstract. Large scale {{agent-based}} simulation {{has become}} the focus of great interest from both academy and industry in resent years. It has been shown an effective tool for understanding a variety of complex systems, such as market economics, war <b>games,</b> and epidemic <b>propagation</b> models. As the systems of interest grow in complexity, it is often desirable to have different categories of artificial agents that execute tasks on different time scales.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a class of {{propagation}} models for multiple competing products over a social network. We consider two propagation mechanisms: social conversion and self conversion, corresponding, respectively, to endogenous and exogenous factors. A novel concept, the product-conversion graph, is proposed to characterize the interplay among competing products. According to the chronological order of social and self conversions, we develop two Markov-chain models and, based on the independence approximation, we approximate them with two respective difference equations systems. Theoretical analysis on these two approximation models reveals the dependency of the systems' asymptotic behavior on the structures of both the product-conversion graph and the social network, as well as the initial condition. In addition to the theoretical work, accuracy of the independence approximation and the asymptotic behavior of the Markov-chain model are investigated via numerical analysis, for the case where social conversion occurs before self conversion. Finally, we propose a class of multi-player and multi-stage competitive <b>propagation</b> <b>games</b> and discuss the seeding-quality trade-off, as well as the allocation of seeding resources among the individuals. We investigate the unique Nash equilibrium at each stage and analyze the system's behavior when every player is adopting the policy at the Nash equilibrium...|$|R
