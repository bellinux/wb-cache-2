2500|$|When she {{was about}} 13 years of age, her father, William Chatfield Booth, moved his family from Yaphank, {{in which she was}} born, to Brooklyn, New York, and there Mr. Booth {{organized}} the first public school that was established in that city. Mr. Booth was a man well qualified both by education and by native character for the guidance of such an intelligence as that developed by his daughter. Deeply interested in scholarly matters, a man of great directness of purpose and of fearless integrity, he and his daughter were in perfect sympathy, and <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> growth with tender solicitude, and in subsequent years cherished with pride every word of her writing. But he could never quite bring himself to believe, even after she had won a handsome independence by her exertions, that she was really altogether capable of her own support, and always insisted upon making her the most generous gifts. As the President of the United States said of him, [...] "A kinder and more honorable gentleman {{it would be hard to}} find." [...] Another daughter and two sons comprised the remainder of his family, the younger of the sons, Colonel Charles A. Booth, saw 20 years' service in the army.|$|E
2500|$|Since the airship was not {{expected}} to return from her Africa mission, no plans for any further missions had been made. Another African flight {{was out of the}} question, so the ship was then offered for flights to supply the Ottoman army of Enver Pasha in Arabia, or to search for mines off Constantinople, but nothing came of these proposals. After several reconnaissance flights and bombing missions, L59 took off from Jamboli to attack the British naval base at Malta, proceeding across the Balkans to the Strait of Otranto. [...] On the evening of 7 April 1918 the surfaced German submarine UB-53 observed the airship approaching from astern. [...] Her commanding officer, Oberleutnant zur See Robert Sprenger, reported that <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> fly past at about 210m (700ft), so [...] "close in fact that the details of the gondola could be seen clearly." [...] A few minutes later, Sprenger noted two bursts in the air, and shortly afterwards [...] "a gigantic flame enveloped the airship and it nosed down into the water." [...] The airship’s destruction was not claimed by either the British or the Italians; her loss was officially attributed to an accident. None of the 21 crew survived the crash.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2001, {{the release}} of the second single from the live album Mylenium Tour, [...] "Regrets", was {{cancelled}} because sales of the previous live single [...] "Dessine-moi un mouton" [...] were disappointing (however, the video of [...] "Regrets" [...] aired for one week on M6). But since the summer, various rumours were launched on the Internet about the next Farmer single. Some said that she would record a song as a duet with an international star, perhaps Bono (singer of U2) or Elton John, since they are close friends of the singer. Seal was eventually chosen to sing with Farmer, and on 10 October, the promotional CD single was sent to radio stations. At the time, the public discovered the name of the song: [...] "Les Mots". In an interview, Seal explained that Farmer had proposed to record a single as a duet with him. He felt flattered, but as he knew nothing about Farmer, <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> DVD and listened to her albums to see if their two voices blended well. Cover photographs and the recording were made in Los Angeles, while Farmer was visiting the city. However, Seal said in another interview {{he did not want to}} record other duets of the same kind because, according to him, his fans did not appreciate [...] "Les Mots" [...] and have called this collaboration a [...] "trick". Three new visuals made by Isabel Snyder, showing a half-naked Farmer in Seal's arms, were used as cover for the single. The only official remix available on the media, the 'strings's for soul mix', was directed by Laurent Boutonnat. Following the success of the song, a CD maxi was launched in Europe about one year after {{the release of}} the single, which contained as third track the single version of Farmer's previous single, [...] "L'Histoire d'une fée, c'est...".|$|E
