40|$|AbstractWe {{have used}} microspectrofluorimetry with the pH-sensitive dye, BCECF, {{to examine the}} control of {{intracellular}} pH in the secretory <b>endpieces</b> of the sheep parotid gland. Unstimulated <b>endpieces</b> in HCO 3 −-free media have a cytosolic pH of 7. 5 ± 0. 03 (n = 69) which is maintained by a Na+-dependent proton extrusion process that can be partially supported by Li+ but not by Cs+, and is not affected by changes in extracellular Cl−, HCO 3 − or K+. It is not blocked by SITS or DIDS, which inhibit Na+-(nHCO 3 − co-transport and Cl− 1 -HCO 3 − exchange, nor is it sensitive to the amiloride analogs, MIA and EIPA, which inhibit Na+-H+ exchangers, although very high concentrations of amiloride itself (1 mmoll) have a (probably non-specific) inhibitory effect. It seems likely that sheep parotid secretory <b>endpieces</b> do contain a Na+-H+ exchanger that drives secretion of a HCO 3 −-rich juice, and that its insensitivity to amiloride and its analogs explains why these drugs do not block fluid secretion by the intact sheep parotid gland...|$|R

5000|$|Placoparia is a genus of trilobites {{of average}} size (up to 6 cm) that lived {{during the late}} Lower to the early Upper Ordovician on the paleocontinents Gondwana, Avalonia and Laurentia, now the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Morocco, Portugal, Spain and Wales. Its headshield (or cephalon) is {{semi-circular}} to rectangular with rounded frontal corners. It lacks eyes, but eye ridges are present. The fact that the facial sutures are [...] opisthoparian (with sutures in Pliomera gonatoparian) is an exception in the otherwise proparian Cheirurina. The thorax has 11 or 12 segments, with the axis slightly wider than the ribs (or pleurae) to its sides. The tips of the pleurae are free, which associates with an old-fashion radiatior of the central heating. The axis in the small tailshield (or pygidium) consists of four rings and a minute <b>endpiece.</b> The four pleurae end in spatulate spines that fit to corresponding indentations in the cephalon.|$|E
50|$|Ogygiocarella {{has a very}} flat calcified dorsal exoskeleton, with an oval outline (about 1½× {{longer than}} wide). The headshield (or cephalon) is 2½× wider than long, and of equal size as the tailshield (or pygidium), a state called isopygeous. Both are semicircular. The backcorners of the cephalon end in {{so-called}} genal spines that stick backwards approximately to the 6th thorax segment. The central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) has 4 pairs of furrows and expands {{in front of the}} eyes. The eyes are small, close to the glabella and in the rear half of the cephalon. The dorsal facial sutures, that split when moulding, arch {{from the front of the}} eye and pass in front of the glabella. The suture follows the top of the visual surface, as in all trilobites, and from there cut backwards and outwards at approximately 45° to reach the posterior margin of the cephalon approximately halfway between the glabella and the lateral border. As usual for members of the Asaphidae family, it has 8 articulating segments in the middle part of the body (or thorax). The axis is about half as wide as the ribs (or pleurae) to each of the sides. In the thorax the axis tapers slightly towards the back. In the pygidium the axis tapers stronger and terminates a short distance from the margin in a roundish <b>endpiece.</b> It has 10-14 ribs on each side of the axis, which fade-out in the border that is as wide as the axis.|$|E

40|$|The ultrastucture of {{the snake}} Eryx jayakari (E. jayakari) mature sperm has not been published. Therefore, {{the present study was}} {{conducted}} to elucidate the sperm ultrastructure of this species in comparison with that of other reptilian species. The present investigation has shown that mature spermatozoa of Eryx jayakari are filiform in shape averaging 45 m (mean of 10) in length with a curved head measuring 9 m. The acrosomal complex, which involves the acrosomal cap and subacrosomal material, measures 2. 5 m. The nucleus is 6. 5 m in length, the neck approximates 1 m and the tail (midpiece, principal piece and <b>endpiece)</b> is maximally 35 m in length. The different tail pieces vary in diameter, being the largest at the midpiece (0. 66 m), diminished at the principal piece (0. 36 m) and the least at the <b>endpiece</b> (0. 25 m). The midpiece, the longest tail piece, is composed of mitochondrial and fibrous sheaths encircling the microtubular axoneme. The mitochondria are rod-shaped having linear cristae but no dense bodies interrupt their arrangement. The principal tail piece consists of the microtubular axoneme surrounded by the fibrous sheath. The <b>endpiece</b> involves only an axoneme enveloped within the plasmalemma of the spermatozoon. The present findings were discussed in relation to other relevant studies. It was concluded that the general ultrastucture of the E. jayakari spermatozoon conforms to that reported to be typical of squamates...|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} morphologic {{description of}} emu sperm {{at the light}} microscopy level, an essential prerequisite for the routine evaluation of semen quality in this species, is not currently available. In this study, sperm morphology and morphometry were evaluated using conventionally prepared Romanowsky-stained semen smears of samples collected from the distal ductus deferens from 15 adult birds and fixed in 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde. Examination of the smears using phase contrast under 100 magnification readily resolved the various components of the cell, namely, the acrosome, nucleus, midpiece, principal piece, and <b>endpiece.</b> This technique was simple to use and produced consistently reproducible results. Normal emu spermwere typically filiform in appearance and closely resembled sperm of the ostrich and other non-passerine species, particularly poultry. A previously undescribed cytoplasmic appendage, associated with {{the base of the}} head, was a novel morphologic feature.

40|$|A {{detailed}} description of the sperm ultrastructure of Tropidurus semitaeniatus and T. torquatus is provided. Mature spermatozoa of T. semitaeniatus and T. torquatus are filiform and characterized by: apical portion of acrosome depressed; perforatorium single; epinuclear lucent zone well developed; midpiece short; mitochondria columnar; midpiece with three sets of alternating ring structures and mitochondria (rs 1 /m 1, rs 2 /m 2, rs 3 /m 3); nuclear shoulders rounded; nucleus elongate; fibres 3 and 8 enlarged; and fibrous sheath in midpiece. Spermatozoa ofTropidurus are unusual in possessing a unilateral electron-lucent ridge at the surface of the acrosome and an epinuclear electron-lucent zone.

40|$|Myoepithelial cells (MEC) are “star-shaped” or “basket” cells that, in {{salivary glands}} and other exocrine glands, lie between the basal lamina and the {{secretory}} <b>endpiece</b> and ductal cells; MEC resemble smooth muscle cells and epithelial cells in several aspects. The occurrence {{and distribution of}} MEC vary among glands and species in adults and during growth and differentiation. The optical sectioning by confocal laser scanning microscopy allowed artifacts during observation to be minimal; in addition, this technical approach avoids continuously changing and adjusting the plane of focus either through the apex of epithelium or in order to cross-section the secretory and ductal elements.

40|$|We {{estimated}} the proliferative activity of serous and mucous acinar cells in mixed-type salivary glands of sucking Mongolian gerbils, using immunohistochemistry with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and in vivo labeling of S-phase cells with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). In both sublingual and Weber's (postlingual) salivary glands, acinar secretory cells showing immunoreactivity for anti-PCNA and anti-BrdU were restricted to serous-type cells that were also positive for a serous component, lysozyme. Some less-differentiated cells {{found in the}} serous demilunes or acini, which were negative for lysozyme, also showed proliferative activity, while mucous-type cells never did.

40|$|A new {{mutation}} in mice affecting the mucous cell differentiation of the sublingual glands is described. The normal mouse sublingual glands are mucus-secreting {{and virtually all}} the acinar cells differentiate to mucus-rich cells by the day of birth. In contrast, all <b>endpieces</b> of newborn mutant mice consisted of acini of immature cuboidal cells. However, normal mucous cells, staining intensively with mucin-specific stains such as Alcian blue at pH 2. 5 or mucicarmine, appeared in the mutant mice {{from an early age}} singly or in groups in a small number of acini, and their number apparently increased with age to occupy over 30 % of the total acinar cells. Ultrastructurally, irregular secretion granules of varying electron-density, distinct from ordinary sublingual mucin granules, were frequently observed in the cytoplasm of the immature acinar cells in the mutant phenotype. The genetic analysis showed that a single autosomal recessive gene determined the observed abnormality. This is the first salivary gland mutation and will provide a critical model for the study of salivary mucous cell differentiation...|$|R
40|$|A {{new species}} of Lepidodasys is {{described}} from sublittoral sandy sediments off the Atlantic coast of Florida. Lepidodasys ligni sp. n. is a small species (≤ 450 µm) with a crossed-helical pattern of small, non-keeled, non-imbricated scales on the dorsal and lateral body surfaces, two columns of ventral, interciliary scales that form a herringbone pattern, {{and a series of}} anterior, lateral, dorsal and posterior adhesive tubes. Similar to L. castoroides from the Faroe Islands, the new species possesses a caudal constriction that demarcates the posterior end containing the caudal organ. The frontal organ lies within the posterior constriction, which is heavily invested with somatic circular muscles. These muscles are also present throughout the trunk and represent a novel condition for species of Lepidodasys, which were previously considered to lack somatic circular muscles. Posterior of the caudal constriction is a large, barrel-shaped caudal organ that is wrapped in a series of interdigitating, spindle-shaped, incomplete circular muscle fibers.

40|$|Salivary glands from 12 {{bovine animals}} were dissected, weighed and sampled for {{histological}} examination. The total salivary gland weight {{was positively correlated}} with body weight but there were not normally consistent differences between the weights of left and right glands. However, in animals that had chronic re-entrant cannulations of the left parotid and mandibular ducts, the ipsilateral glands were always lighter. The histological features of salivary glands and the histochemical reactivity of their secretory and duct cells were examined. Parotid gland secretory endpieces were elongated and their individual cells contained PAS+ve granules. These cells were shown by immunohistochemistry to be the site of protein secretion and thus were classified as proteoserous cells. Chronic parotid duct cannulation in association with duct obstruction caused dilation of the secretory <b>endpiece</b> lumens and degenerative changes within the <b>endpiece</b> cells. Intralobular duct cells contained PAS+ve granules which may be the secretory component that is associated with secretory IgA. Variable numbers of intrastriated duct cells occured in the parotid glands of different animals and in retrospect, this was found to correlate positively with the animals known susceptibility to bloat. The parotid excretory duct contained many goblet cells which contribute a small amount of mucosubstance to the proteoserous secretion. Secretory endpieces of the mandibular gland were composed of mucous cells which were PAS, AY and weakly AB+ve and demilune cells which were PAS and AB+ve as well as acidophilic and pyroninophilic. Clumps of plasma cells were observed in the intralobular connective tissue. The effect of obstruction of chronic duct cannulation on the mandibular gland was to dilate <b>endpiece</b> and intralobular duct lumens, cause degenerative changes in mucous and demilune cells and increase the numbers of small lymphocytes, PMN neutrophils and mast cells in the connective tissues of the gland. By contrast with the excretory duct of the parotid, that of the mandibular contained no goblet cells but simply a stratified columnar epithelium. Mucous cells of the sublingual gland were PAS+ve, AY+ve and weakly AB+ve and arranged into long tubular endpieces. The demilune cells contained abundant PAS+ve, AB+ve, AY-ve granules. Many plasma cells were present in the connective tissue between the secretory endpieces and around the intralobular and interlobular ducts. In animals with chronic cannulations of parotid and mandibular glands the ispilateral sublingual gland weighed less than the contralateral gland. The posterior tongue, soft palate, pharynx and the lingual aspect of the epiglottis contained extensive areas of glandular tissue. The secretory endpieces consisted of a high proportion of mucous cells and a few scattered proteoserous demilune cells. The glandular tissue of the epiglottis contained abundant plasma cells in the intralobular connective tissue. Based on their histochemical reactivity the demilune cells of the intermediate buccal glands produced a purely serous secretion. In addition, the intermediate and dorsal buccal glands contained many AB, AY and PAS+ve mucous producing cells. The labial glands were small, scattered lobules of secretory tissue found at the labial commisures. The glandular lobules were composed of tubular secretory endpieces capped with large proteoserous demilune cells which were AY-ve, PAS+ve, strongly acidophilic and pyroninophilic. Large numbers of plasma cells were found in the connective tissues within and around the secretory tissue...|$|E
40|$|Submandibular glands of {{two male}} and two female adult ferrets were {{examined}} using electron microscopy. The secretory <b>endpiece</b> consisted of mucous acini and seromucous demilunes.

Two types of demilune cells could be identified, based on the differing electron density of their secretion granules. In some cells the granules were more electron-dense than in others. These granules may contain {{the two types of}} mucosubstances identified in an earlier study. The demilunes probably drained into the intercellular canaliculi present in between them and eventually into the acinar lumen through a demilune projecting into it. The intercalated ducts were shorter compared to those of the parotid glands. Many of the striated duct cells contained electron-dense secretion granules. The basal plasmalemma of these cells was invaginated to form linear folds. Few agranular cells were interspersed among the granulated cells of the striated ducts...|$|E

40|$|By SEM we have {{investigated}} the human minor salivary glands using the NaOH method for the visualization of <b>endpieces</b> and myoepithelial cells, and the osmium maceration technique that reveals membranous intracellular structures. With the former method all minor glands, including the posterior deep (Ebner's) lingual glands, consist of tubules sometimes dilated into alveoli, while true acini of the kind observed in human major salivary glands, are absent. Tubules of the posterior deep lingual gland exhibit stellate myoepitelial cells that leave {{a substantial part of}} the secretory cells uncovered. The latter cells, at variance with serous cells of major glands, do not show basal folds. In contrast, tubules of the other minor glands, like the mucous ones of major glands, are covered almost completely by band-like myoepithelial cells. The osmium maceration method clearly demonstrates that posterior deep lingual glands are serous in character and that all the other minor glands, together with the predominant mucous cells, possess a variable number of seromucous cells that, despite variations among individuals, increase in order from palatine and posterior superficial lingual (Weber's), to minor sublingual, labial, anterior lingual (Blandin and Nuhn's), and buccal glands...|$|R
