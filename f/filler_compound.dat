40|$|Abstract: We {{assessed}} {{the use of}} a <b>filler</b> <b>compound</b> together with the osteoinductive demineralized bone matrix (DBM), Colloss E. The filler was comprised of carboxymethyl-cellulose and collagen type 1. The {{purpose of the study was}} to see if the <b>filler</b> <b>compound</b> would enhance the bone formation and distribute the osteoinductive stimulus throughout the bone defect. Six sheep underwent a bilateral humerus drill defect. The drill hole was filled with a compound consisting of 100 mg CMC, 100 mg collagen powder, and 1 ccm autologous full blood in one side, and a combination of this <b>filler</b> <b>compound</b> and 20 mg Colloss E in the other. The animals were divided into three groups of two animals and observed for 8, 12 and 16 weeks. Drill holes was evaluated using quantitative computed tomography (QCT), micro computed tomography (�CT) and histomorphometry. Mean total bone mineral density (BMD) of each implantation site was calculated with both QCT and �CT. Bone volume to total volume (BV/TV) was analyzed using �CT and histomorphometry. Although not statistically significant, results showed increased bone BMD after 16 weeks in �CT data and an increased BV/TV after 16 weeks in both �CT and histology. Correlation between QCT and �CT was R 2 = 0. 804. Correlation between histomorphometry and �CT BV/TV data was R 2 = 0. 8935 and with an average overrepresentation of 8. 2 % in histomorphometry. In conclusion the CMC-Collagen + Colloss E filler seems like a viable osteogenic bone filler mid- to long term. A correlation was found between the analytical methods used in this study...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. The optimal granulometric {{composition}} of <b>filler</b> <b>compound</b> ensures the production of concrete having improved  physical and mechanical characteristics, {{as well as}} minimal binder  consumption. The properties of heat-resistant concrete largely  depend on the type and the ratio of its components. Taking this into  account, {{the aim of the}} study is to determine the optimal grain {{composition of}} heat-resistant concrete. Methods. Methods for optimising the properties of heatresistant basaltic concrete with a composite binder and  mechanochemical activation of the filler grains were used during the  course of the research. A simplex-centroid experiment design is  applied for this purpose. The composite binder was subjected to  mechanochemical activation. Samples were made by vibration-pressing from a concrete mix with a cone draught of 2 cm. Results. The grain composition of heat-resistant concrete is proved  {{to be the most important}} variable factor, regulating which the  properties of concrete can be varied. The compositions of heat- resistant basaltic concrete with activated composite binder having a  maximum application temperature of 700 ºС are developed.  The  influence of the grain composition of the basaltic filler on the  properties of basaltic concrete using mathematical experiment planning methods is determined. The regression equations for the ultimate tensile strength and bending stress of basaltic concrete are  obtained for heating temperature of 700 ºC. Conclusion. The granulometric composition of heat-resistant basaltic concrete based on the activated binder is optimised for basic physical and technical properties. The optimal granulometric  design of the composition of heat-resistant concrete indicates that as the coarse fraction (particles greater than  0. 63 mm) in the filler  composition increases, the ultimate tensile strength and bending  stress of heatresistant basaltic concrete is increased when heated to  a temperature of 700 ºС. This is due to a more compact arrangement of sand grains. </p...|$|E
40|$|Zinc air {{batteries}} {{have great}} promise {{as a new}} age energy storage device due to their environmental benignity, high energy density {{in terms of both}} mass and volume, and low cost Zinc air batteries get their high energy density by using oxygen from the air as the active material. This means that all the mass and volume that are normally required for active material in a battery are replaced by a thin gas diffusion electrode which allows for oxygen from the air to diffuse into the cell. Although this seems ideal, there are many technical challenges associated with the cell being open to the atmosphere. Some of these issues include electrolyte and electrode drying out, poor reaction kinetics involving sluggish reaction, the need for bifunctional catalysts to charge and discharge, and durability of the gas diffusion electrode itself. The bifuntional catalysts used in these systems are often platinum or other precious metals since these are commonly known to have the highest performance, however the inherent cost of these materials limits the feasibility of zinc air systems. Thus, {{there is a need to}} limit or remove the necessity for platinum carbon catalysts. There are many types of non precious metal catalysts which can be used in place of platinum, however their performance is often not as high, and the durability of these catalysts is also weak. Similar limitations on feasibility are invoked by the poor durability of the gas diffusion electrodes. Carbon corrosion occurs at the harsh caustic conditions present at the gas diffusion electrodes, and this corrosion causes catalyst dissolution. Moreover, many issues with zinc electrode fabrication limit durability and usable anode surface area within these systems. There is a need for a stable, porous, high surface area anode with good structural integrity. These issues are addressed in this work by three studies which each focuses on solving some of the issues pertaining to a crucial component of zinc air batteries, those being the gas diffusion electrode, the zinc electrode, and the bifunctional catalyst necessary for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). The first study addresses the need for improvements to the zinc anode electrode. A new process is proposed for the production of porous zinc electrodes in which the porosity can be easily controlled. This process involves the mixing of atomized zinc powder with a <b>filler</b> <b>compound</b> such as ammonium chloride. The mixture is then pressed into a pellet and heat treated to a temperature which simultaneously sublimes/decomposes the <b>filler</b> <b>compound,</b> and anneals the zinc structure to improve structural integrity. The resultant porous anode showed significantly charge and discharge potentials over the solid plate anode, while allowing for increased control of porosity over other porous electrodes due to the ability to adjust pore size based on the <b>filler</b> <b>compound</b> particle size. The discharge potentials observed from these porous anodes were 20 % greater than zinc plate anodes at 100 mA, but up to 200 % greater at elevated currents of 200 mA. Similarly the charging potentials were 53. 8 % lower at 100 mA, and 55. 5 % lower at 200 mA., suggesting greatly improved performance by the porous anode. The second study addresses the need for more durable gas diffusion electrodes. In this study, the bifunctional catalyst was bound directly to a stainless steel current collector via polymer binding in an attempt to remove the possibility of carbon corrosion and catalyst dissolution. The new gas diffusion electrode was successful in eliminating carbon corrosion, wherein, the durability of cells which incorporate this type of electrode was significantly increased. The durability of cell was increased to a point where little to no degradation occurred over 1000 cycles of full cell testing, showing great promise for future use and commercial viability. The final study addresses the need for durable and high performance non precious metal catalysts. The effects of catalyst morphology were studied wherein various morphologies of spinel type cobalt oxide were synthesized and compared. Cobalt oxide nanosheets were successfully synthesized and compared to nanoparticles of comparable size. The cobalt oxide nanosheets showed better charge and discharge potentials as well as durability of the nanoparticles. Impedance analyses showed reduced charge transfer and cell component resistances associated with the nanosheet morphology. Cobalt oxide nanosheets were further compared against platinum carbon. Cobalt oxide nanosheets showed significantly better durability as well as lower charging potentials and higher discharge potentials over 75 cycles. After 75 cycles the platinum carbon had lost 55. 7 % of its discharge potential wherein cobalt oxide nanosheets lost none of its discharge potential. Three issues pertaining to three major cell components a zinc air were addressed with promising solutions proposed for each. This work provides a basis for advanced zinc electrode fabrication in which further improvements can be incorporated to address other issues pertaining to zinc electrode use. This work set up a basis for electrode design which focuses on non carbon supported catalysts, eliminating the issue of carbon corrosion and associated catalyst dissolution. Finally, the results from the morphology study elucidate the benefits of controlled morphology for bifunctional catalysts, showing how morphology can be adjusted to improve performance by improving cell and charge transfer resistances. 1 yea...|$|E

Gate chip off, which occurs during the degating process in transfer molding {{is one of the}} common defects which contributes to the failure in the proper functioning of the package. During the degating process, surface contact between two solid bodies (degating blade and gate) generate a high shear stress on package, thus creating a high potential for the incidence of gate chip of.

This study showed that upon irradiation, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene (LDPE-g-MAH) addition as coupling agent to the LDPE/fillers, improved processing and mechanical properties of compounds at each irradiation dosage (0110 kGy). A gradual increase in gel content (GC) and tensile strength (TS) with a concomitant decline in elongation at break (EB), hot set (HS) and densities of compounds were observed upon irradiation of the blends.

Filled rubber composites of car tyres are a prime example, as {{improvement of the}} material properties and reduction in the carbon footprint are both of interest. However, even with continued research into this subject, questions remain concerning {{the causes of the}} observed properties of these composites, namely the non-linear reinforcement and the presence of significant strain softening. This report documents the examination of polybutadiene rubber composites with multiple techniques to characterise and determine the cause of the non-linear phenomena. The macroscopic material properties were characterised with rheological measurements, while the nanoscale composite structure and polymer dynamics were examined with small angle neutron scattering and quasi-elastic neutron scattering, respectively. Different <b>filler</b> <b>compounds,</b> carbon black, precipitated silica, and Stöber silica, were utilized to provide additional data to build an improved picture of the composite systems. A hydroxyl end functionalised polybutadiene chain known to segregate to silica substrates was used for examination of polymer interfacial dynamics and changes to composite material properties when used as an additive. Reinforcement of the rubber with the addition of all the fillers was noted and analysed to determine the causes. A significant observation was the change in the mechanical properties of the silica filler composite with the presence of the end functionalised polybutadiene; decreased reinforcement and changes to behaviour under significant strains were noted. Changes to the nanoscale correlations of the silica filler with the presence of the end functionalised polybutadiene was observed with small angle neutron scattering, and determined to be from steric stabilisation of the silica particles. Hindered polymer dynamics near the silica filler surface were noted with quasi elastic neutron scattering. Neither the particle correlations nor the polymer dynamics were found to shift with the application of strain to the composite samples, in contrast to the alterations noted in the mechanical properties. From the information gathered on the composite microscopic and macroscopic properties a model for the composite behaviour was devised. The reinforcement of the rubber with the addition of filler material was determined to be a result of the networking of the filler particles.

Carbon nano tube, nano silica, nano clay, nano CaCO 3, etc. are the some commonly used nano <b>fillers</b> for rubber <b>compounds.</b> But in the present time, nano CaCO 3 has gained great attention of a modern researcher {{as it is the}} cheapest commercially available nano filler. Furthermore, nano CaCO 3 has some additional advantages like low toxicity level, less polluting nature and white color [8]. Thus, nano CaCO 3 is an appropriate filler for the property enhancement of rubber nanocomposites from both environmental and economic point of view. The utilization of nano CaCO 3 as filler for the improvement of performance of rubber nanocomposites has been reported in the literature [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A low-friction {{coefficient}} {{material with}} color based on proper selection of polar conditions of pigment and liquid lubricant was developed. Bush-type bearings {{were made from}} poly oxymethylene reinforced with inorganic <b>fillers,</b> including polar <b>compounds</b> of white carbon and glass powder, and nonpolar compounds of carbon black and graphite. The fillers were coated with different levels of titanate, and with polar lubricants such as cetyl alcohol and palmitic acid, and nonpolar lubricants of motor oil, and paraffin. The frictional properties at constant velocity and at constant loading, and the relationships between materials polarity are discussed. An excellent self-lubricat-ing material of frictional coefficient less than 0. 02 was obtained. That is superior to the most current commercial products claiming m 5 0. 05; 0. 06. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons...|$|R
