5|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient times as a durable, {{corrosion}} resistant, and weatherproof architectural material. Roofs, <b>flashings,</b> rain gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from copper for {{hundreds or thousands of}} years. Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and recyclability.|$|E
5|$|Weisman {{explains}} that a common house {{would begin to}} fall apart as water eventually leaks into the roof around the <b>flashings,</b> erodes the wood and rusts the nails, leading to sagging walls and eventual collapse. After 500 years, all that would be left would be aluminum dishwasher parts, stainless steel cookware, and plastic handles. The longest-lasting evidence on Earth of a human presence would be radioactive materials, ceramics, bronze statues, and Mount Rushmore. In space, the Pioneer plaques, the Voyager Golden Record, and radio waves would outlast the Earth itself.|$|E

25|$|Architects often look to {{architectural}} copper for {{continuity in}} design elements. For example, a copper roofing {{system may be}} designed with copper <b>flashings,</b> weatherings, vents, gutters, and downpipes. Cover details may include cornices, moldings, finials and sculptures.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{has earned}} a {{respected}} place in the related fields of architecture, building construction, and interior design. From cathedrals to castles and from homes to offices, copper is used {{for a variety of}} architectural elements, including roofs, <b>flashings,</b> gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, wall cladding, and building expansion joints.|$|E
25|$|Cold rolled 1/8"-hard temper copper is {{recommended}} for most flashing applications. This material offers more resistance than soft copper to the stresses of expansion and contraction. Soft copper can be specified where extreme forming is required, such as in complicated roof shapes. Thermal movement in <b>flashings</b> is prevented or is permitted only at predetermined locations.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{architectural}} copper {{is used in}} roofing systems, <b>flashings</b> and copings, rain gutters and downspouts, building expansion joints, wall cladding, domes, spires, vaults, {{and various}} other design elements. Simultaneously, the metal has evolved from a weather barrier and exterior design element into indoor building environments where it is changing the way commercial and residential interiors are decorated.|$|E
25|$|Craftsmen and {{designers}} utilize copper’s inherent benefits to build aesthetically pleasing and long-lasting building systems. From cathedrals to castles and from homes to offices, copper {{is used in}} many products: low-sloped and pitched roofs, soffits, fascias, <b>flashings,</b> gutters, downspouts, building expansion joints, domes, spires, and vaults. Copper {{is also used to}} clad walls and other surfaces in the exterior and interior environment.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{is one of}} {{the most}} noble metals. It will not be harmed by contact with other metals but it will cause {{corrosion}} to some other metals if contacted directly. The principal metals of concern regarding direct contact with copper are aluminum, light-gauge steel, and zinc. Aluminum and steel <b>flashings</b> and galvanized steel fasteners should not be used with copper. Runoff from a copper roof corrodes aluminum and steel guttering. It is not necessary to isolate copper from lead, tin or many stainless steels under most circumstances.|$|E
500|$|Tabley House was {{designated}} as a GradeI listed building on 5March 1959. [...] Its architectural style is Palladian, the only 18th-century Palladian country house in Cheshire. [...] The house has three storeys; the bottom storey is constructed in rusticated stone, with the upper storeys in Flemish bond brick with stone dressings. [...] A Doric frieze runs around the whole building below the eaves. [...] The roofs are in green slate with lead <b>flashings.</b> [...] The south front has nine bays, the central three bays projecting forward. [...] On {{each side of the}} central projection is a semi-circular stairway leading to the middle floor. [...] The stairway is built in rusticated stone and it has a moulded balustrade. [...] From the top of the stairway a portico rises through the top two storeys. [...] It consists of four columns in Doric style constructed from red Runcorn sandstone. [...] Its tympanum contains the arms of Sir Peter Byrne Leicester and his wife, Catherine. [...] All the windows in the ground floor are sashes with 3x2 panes and over each window there are splayed voussoirs. [...] The central bay of the middle storey contains a doorway with an architrave and a segmental pediment carried on brackets. [...] On each side of the door is a window with similar architraves and segmental pediments, but not carried on brackets. [...] In the lateral three bays on each side are sash windows with 3x5 panes over which are architraves and triangular pediments. [...] The top floor windows are also sashes, these having 3x3 panes, and architraves with scrolls at the top and bottom.|$|E
2500|$|Abney Park was {{included}} on the Heritage at Risk Register in 2009, as one of Britain's historic parks and gardens at risk from neglect and decay. Although the level of malicious damage is kept low by the conspicuous presence of staff and volunteers of the Abney Park Trust when maintaining the park; by frequent arts and environmental events promoted by the trust; and by community safety initiatives involving the police and their community support officers; nevertheless, over time it has taken its toll, leading to the current 'at risk' designation. The roof slates and roof <b>flashings</b> of the Abney Park Chapel have been damaged by unauthorised climbing and theft at times when the park was left unsupervised and unlocked overnight, and this has resulted in water seepage into the chapel walls which is now causing serious problems to the whole building. Similarly, from time to time, some sections of boundary wall become too weak due to people climbing over them, and decay has set in. However these matters could be put right and the park is a popular place to visit, {{with a range of}} educational, training and cultural events and an annual summer open day. It is a designated Local Nature Reserve and Conservation Area. Apart from the South Lodge extension on the forecourt, Abney Park's freehold is owned by the London Borough of Hackney. The park is situated near Stoke Newington High Street, London N16, and it is leased to the [...] It occupies , which includes a nature reserve, a classroom, a visitor's centre and a central chapel which is disused.

6000|$|And then, with <b>flashings</b> of light, I was off and away. At a bound I had vaulted prison {{roof and}} California sky, and {{was among the}} stars. I say [...] "stars" [...] advisedly. I walked among the stars. I was a child. I was clad in frail, fleece-like, delicate-coloured robes that shimmered in the cool starlight. These robes, of course, were based upon my boyhood {{observance}} of circus actors and my boyhood conception of the garb of young angels.|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} my {{experience}} differs from Morrell's. Still willing automatically, I {{began to grow}} dreamy, as one does in that borderland between sleeping and waking. Also, {{it seemed as if}} a prodigious enlargement of my brain was taking place within the skull itself that did not enlarge. There were occasional glintings and <b>flashings</b> of light as if even I, the overlord, had ceased for a moment and the next moment was again myself, still the tenant of the fleshly tenement that I was making to die.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, {{the note}} of Mr. Scribe, so strangely recalling {{the memory of}} my kinsman, very {{naturally}} chimed in with what had been mysterious, or at least unexplained, about him; vague <b>flashings</b> of ingots united in my mind with vague gleamings of skulls. But the first cool thought soon dismissed such chimeras; and, with a calm smile, I turned towards my wife, who, meantime, had been sitting nearby, impatient enough, I dare say, to know who could have taken it into his head to write me a letter.|$|E
60|$|In a taxi, and away, {{heading for}} the Barbary Coast, Harry Del Mar saw visions that were golden. They took on the semblance of yellow, twenty- dollar gold pieces, of yellow-backed paper bills of the {{government}} stamping of the United States, of bank books, and of rich coupons ripe for the clipping--and all shot through the <b>flashings</b> of {{the form of a}} rough-coated Irish terrier, on a galaxy of brilliantly-lighted stages, mouth open, nose upward to the drops, singing, ever singing, as no dog had ever been known to sing in the world before.|$|E
60|$|The quick ear of Ruth had not deceived her. The tumult of {{the assault}} was {{gradually}} receding from the works, and though the <b>flashings</b> of the muskets and the bellowing reports that rang in the surrounding forest were not less frequent than before, it was plain that the critical moment of the onset was already past. In place of the fierce effort to carry the place by surprise, the savages had now resorted to means that were more methodical, and which, though not so appalling in appearance, were perhaps quite as certain of final success. Ruth profited by a momentary cessation in the flight of the missiles, to seek those in whose welfare she had placed her chief concern.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pitt's Speeches, as I spell {{them from}} Walpole {{and the other}} faint tracings left, are full of genius in the vocal kind, far beyond any Speeches {{delivered}} in Parliament: serious always, and the very truth, such as he has it; but going in many dialects and modes; full of airy <b>flashings,</b> twinkles and coruscations. Sport, as of sheet-lightning glancing about, the bolt lying under the horizon; bolt HIDDEN, as is fit, under such a horizon as he had. A singularly radiant man. Could have been a Poet, too, in some small measure, had he gone on that line. There are many touches of genius, comic, tragic, lyric, something of humor even, to be read in those Shadows of Speeches taken down for us by Walpole....|$|E
6000|$|As we drew {{nearer the}} land, I hailed with delight the {{appearance}} of innumerable sea-fowl. Screaming and whirling in spiral tracks, they would accompany the vessel, and at times alight on our yards and stays. That piratical-looking fellow, appropriately named the man-of-war’s-hawk, with his blood-red bill and raven plumage, would come sweeping round us in gradually diminishing circles, till you could distinctly mark the strange <b>flashings</b> of his eye; and then, as if satisfied with his observation, would sail {{up into the air}} and disappear from the view. Soon, other evidences of our vicinity to the land were apparent, and it was not long before the glad announcement of it being in sight was heard from aloft,—given with that peculiar prolongation of sound that a sailor loves—“Land ho!” ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the evening}} of our arrival at Muka I {{observed}} what appeared like a display of Aurora Borealis, though I could hardly {{believe that this was}} possible at a point a little south of the equator. The night was clear and calm, and the northern sky presented a diffused light, with a constant succession of faint vertical <b>flashings</b> or flickerings, exactly similar to an ordinary aurora in England. The next day was fine, but after that the weather was unprecedentedly bad, considering that it ought to have been the dry monsoon. For near a month we had wet weather; the sun either not appearing at all, or only {{for an hour or two}} about noon. Morning and evening, as well as nearly all night, it rained or drizzled, and boisterous winds, with dark clouds, formed the daily programme. With the exception that it was never cold, it was just such weather as a very bad English November or February.|$|E
6000|$|But imagine now a King and his Voltaire doing witty {{discourse}} {{over their}} Supper {{of the gods}} (as, on the set days, is duly the case); with such a consciousness, burning like Bude light, though close veiled, {{on the part of}} Host and Guest! The Friedrich-Voltaire relation is evidently under sore stress of weather, in those winter-autumn months of 1752,--brown leaves, splashy rains and winds moaning outwardly withal. And, alas, the irrepressibly electric Voltaire, still far from having ended, still only just beginning his Anti-Maupertuis discharges, has, in the interim, privately got his DOCTOR AKAKIA ready. Compared to which, the former missile is as a popgun to a park of artillery shotted with old nails and broken glass!--Such a constraint, at the Royal dinner-table, amid wine and wit, could not continue. The credible account is, it soon cracked asunder; and, after the conceivable sputterings, sparklings and <b>flashings</b> of various complexion, issued in lambent airs of [...] "tacit mutual understanding; and in reading of AKAKIA together,--with peals of laughter from the King," [...] as the common French Biographers assert.|$|E
60|$|The two chiefs {{were now}} armed alike. Each had his spear, his bow, his quiver, his little battle-axe, and his knife; and each had, also, a shield of hides, which {{might serve as}} a means of defence against a {{surprise}} from any of these weapons. The Sioux no longer hesitated, but advanced deeper into the stream, and soon landed on a point of the island which his courteous adversary had left free for that purpose. Had one been there to watch the countenance of Mahtoree, as he crossed the water that separated him from the most formidable and the most hated of all his rivals, he might have fancied that he could trace the gleamings of a secret joy, breaking through the cloud which deep cunning and heartless treachery had drawn before his swarthy visage; and yet there would have been moments, when he might have believed that the <b>flashings</b> of the Teton's eye and the expansion of his nostrils, had their origin in a nobler sentiment, and one more worthy of an Indian chief.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Polly, undeterred by a {{sense of}} grave damage done to his nose, pressed the attack in front, the two young men in violet and blue skirmished on Uncle Jim's flanks, the man in white and black checks sought still further {{outflanking}} possibilities, and two of the apprentice boys ran for oars. The gold-spectacled gentleman, as if inspired, came down the wooden steps again, seized the tablecloth of the jam and egg party, lugged it from under the crockery with inadequate precautions against breakage, and advanced with compressed lips, curious lateral crouching movements, swift <b>flashings</b> of his glasses, and a general suggestion of bull-fighting in his pose and gestures. Uncle Jim was kept busy, and unable to plan his retreat with any strategic soundness. He was moreover manifestly a little nervous about the river in his rear. He gave ground in a curve, and so came right across the rapidly abandoned camp of the family in mourning, crunching a teacup under his heel, oversetting the teapot, and finally tripping backwards over the hamper. The eel flew out at a tangent from his hand and became a mere looping relic on the sward.|$|E
6000|$|From {{about the}} end of June, the Reichs Army kept {{dribbling}} in: the most inferior Army in the world; no part of it well drilled, most of it not drilled at all; and for variety in color, condition, method, and military and pecuniary and other outfit, beggaring description. Hildburghausen does his utmost; Kaiser the like. The number should have far exceeded 50,000; but was not, on the field, of above half that number: 25,000; add at least 8,000 Austrian troops, two regiments of them cavalry; good these 8,000, the rest bad,--that was the Reichs Execution Army; most inferior among Armies; and considerable part of it, all the Protestant part, privately wishing well to Friedrich, they say. Drills itself multifariously in that Camp between Furth and Farrenbach, {{on the east side of}} Regnitz River. Fancy what a sight to Wilhelmina, if she ever drove that way; which I think she hardly would. The Baireuth contingent itself is there; the Margraf would have held out stiff on that point; but Friedrich himself advised compliance. Margraf of Anspach--perverse tippling creature, ill with his Wife, I doubt--has joyfully sent his legal hundreds; will vote for the Reichs Ban against this worst of Germans, whom he has for Brother-in-law. Dark days in the heart of Wilhelmina, those of the Camp at Furth. Days which grow ever darker, with strange <b>flashings</b> out of empyrean lightning from that shrill true heart; no peace more, till the noble heroine die!-- ...|$|E

But now--why, now it is full of interest; yes, and of a sort to break a body's heart. It's a bag of gold that has turned to dirt and ashes in my hands. It could save me, and save me so easily, and yet I've got to go to ruin. It's like drowning with a life preserver in my reach. All the hard luck comes to me, and all the good luck goes to other people--Pudd'nhead Wilson, for instance; even his career has got a sort of a little start at last, and what has he done to deserve it, I should like to know? Yes, he has opened his own road, but he isn't content with that, but must block mine. It's a sordid, selfish world, and I wish I was out of it." [...] He allowed the light of the candle to play upon the jewels of the sheath, but the <b>flashings</b> and sparklings had no charm for his eye; they were only just so many pangs to his heart. [...] "I must not say anything to Roxy about this thing," [...] he said. [...] "She is too daring. She would be for digging these stones out and selling them, and then--why, she would be arrested and the stones traced, and then--" [...] The thought made him quake, and he hid the knife away, trembling all over and glancing furtively about, like a criminal who fancies that the accuser is already at hand.|$|E
