5|$|In January 2001, {{plans were}} drawn up {{to move to}} a 55,000-seat {{purpose-built}} arena {{on the site of the}} King's Dock in Liverpool. The proposed stadium would have had a retractable roof enabling it to be used for concerts and chairman Bill Kenwright had hoped to have <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> for the 2005–06 season.|$|E
5|$|Purnell, Parsons, Tibbets, Spaatz, and LeMay met on Guam {{that same}} day to discuss {{what should be done}} next. Since there was no {{indication}} of Japan surrendering, they decided to proceed with dropping another bomb. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> by August 11, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if the bomb could be readied by August 9. Parsons agreed to try to do so.|$|E
5|$|Another {{story of}} the poem's origin claimed that Helmer's funeral was held {{on the morning of}} May 2, after which McCrae wrote the poem in 20 minutes. A third claim, by Morrison, was that McCrae worked on the poem as time allowed between arrivals of wounded {{soldiers}} in need of medical attention. Regardless of its true origin, McCrae worked on the poem for months before considering <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> for publication. He submitted it to The Spectator in London but it was rejected. It was then sent to Punch, where it was published on December 8, 1915. It was published anonymously, but Punch attributed the poem to McCrae in its year-end index.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the damage}} caused by the cannon, the castle escaped the slighting, or {{deliberate}} damaging, that occurred to many other castles {{at the end of the}} civil war. Nonetheless, Richard Prater was forbidden to return to the castle, despite his promises to support Parliament, and his son, George Prater, only recovered Nunney from its interim owners after Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660. The castle declined and was sold by the Praters to William Whitchurch around 1700. During the 18th century the building was still in a reasonable condition and in 1789 an order was received make <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> to receive French prisoners, although it is unlikely they ever arrived.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{had long}} wanted {{to develop a}} book of nursery rhymes, but such a project left Warne cold. Rhymes were already well {{represented}} in the firm's catalogue, and Warne felt Potter's unbridled enthusiasm for the genre would make the project a headache for him. In the past, {{he had tried to}} discourage Potter's interest in rhymes, believing her own stories superior, but she persisted. He reluctantly agreed to a book of rhymes for 1905, but Potter did not have <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> at the end of 1904, so he accepted the tea party tale instead. Early in 1905, it was decided the book would be published {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|The British mission {{consisting}} of Akers and fifteen British experts arrived in December 1943. This {{was a critical}} time. Severe problems had been encountered with the Norris-Adler barrier. Nickel powder and electro-deposited nickel mesh diffusion barriers were pioneered by American chemist Edward Adler and British interior decorator Edward Norris at the SAM Laboratories. A decision {{had to be made}} whether to persevere with it or switch to a powdered nickel barrier based upon British technology that had been developed by Kellex. Up to this point, both were under development. The SAM Laboratory had 700 people working on gaseous diffusion and Kellex had about 900. The British experts conducted a thorough review, and agreed that the Kellex barrier was superior, but felt that it would be unlikely to be ready in time. Kellex's technical director, Percival C. Keith, disagreed, arguing that his company could get <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> and produce it more quickly than the Norris-Adler barrier. Groves listened to the British experts before he formally adopted the Kellex barrier on 5 January 1944.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} feature of this stadium is the rainwater drainage system. Often, matches are abandoned due to heavy downpour. To overcome this problem, MCA opted for sand-based outfield developed departmentally with technical assistance from STRI Limited, UK. Due to this technology, even during heavy showers, water on the outfield drained out fast making <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> for play again just in few minutes.|$|E

25|$|The Type 1942 {{destroyer}} {{marked a}} major change from previous destroyer concepts made by the Kriegsmarine, {{as it was the}} first concept to be given diesel propulsion. This was done because of the longer endurance offered by diesel, and likely also because diesel fuel was more easily obtainable for Nazi Germany. Only one ship of the type was ever laid down, Z51. The laid down ship was modified heavily, so as to make <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> for service as quickly as possible. The planned six MAN type 12Z32/34, 24-cylinder, two-stroke, 'V'-form diesel engines were replaced by only four such engines.|$|E
25|$|The PHVA {{deliberations}} {{were followed}} by visits to the three most promising site, viz Kuno, Darrah-Jawaharsagar and Sitamata WLS by a survey team of WII headed by Dr Ravi Chellam. The team evaluated sites over various parameters and compared the same with respect to Gir Forest for determining the suitability of sites. They presented their findings in 1995 to the Government of India and the state forest departments. WII researchers confirmed that the Palpur-Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary was the most promising location to re-establish a free ranging population of the Asiatic lions and in 2007 certified <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> to receive its first batch of translocated lions.|$|E

25|$|In March 1943, Lieutenant Colonel John Bishop, {{a former}} staff officer, {{took over as}} {{commanding}} officer, replacing Cooper who had been wounded at Gona in late 1942. The battalion was rebuilt on the Atherton Tablelands as part of preparations to make <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> for further operations in New Guinea. A period of rest and reorganisation followed, during which a batch of over 100 reinforcements was received from the 16th Motor Regiment. As part of the battalion's reorganisation under the Jungle divisional establishment, its authorised strength fell to 803 men many of its vehicles and heavy equipment were returned as the Australian Army was restructured to focus upon operations in the Pacific.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} Gannet AEW.3 first flew in August 1958, {{with carrier}} trials taking place using HMS Centaur in November, {{and the first}} production aircraft delivered in December. By August 1959, 700G Naval Air Squadron was formed as the Trials Unit for the new Gannet. This unit put the aircraft through an intensive test programme to make <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> for operation service, a process that lasted until January 1960, {{at which point the}} unit was renamed as 'A' Flight of 849 Naval Air Squadron. 849A Flight was then declared operational and was embarked {{for the first time in}} HMS Ark Royal. A total of 44 Gannets were ordered for the Royal Navy to replace the Skyraider.|$|E
25|$|At 20:30, just {{a half-hour}} {{after it had}} {{completed}} the crossing of the Umi, the 2/16th received orders from Dougherty to pull back. With considerable lack of enthusiasm, the 2/16th re-crossed the Umi, {{this time in the}} dark. Re-crossing commenced at 03:00 and was completed by 08:00. Lieutenant R. G. Crombie's 11 Platoon was left behind on the high ground overlooking Sagerak. It entered Sagerak that morning, and found it deserted. About 16 Japanese soldiers fled when upon their approach, leaving behind their documents, medical stores and equipment. Lieutenant Everette E. Frazier, an American aviation engineer, pegged out a landing strip nearby and had <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> to receive C-47s in four hours.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) {{sought the}} ability to pack up an MQ-9 in less than eight hours, fly it {{anywhere}} in the world aboard a C-17 Globemaster III, and then have <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> to fly in another eight hours to support special operations teams at places with no infrastructure. MQ-1 and MQ-9 drones must fly aboard cargo aircraft to travel long distances as they lack the refueling technology or speed to travel themselves; the C-17 is large enough to carry the aircraft and support systems and can land on short runways. Pilots traveling with the Reaper will use the ground control station to launch and land the aircraft, while most of the flying will be done by US-based pilots.|$|E
25|$|On October 28, 2014, the Los Angeles-based {{production}} company Royal Road Entertainment {{announced that it}} had negotiated an agreement, {{with the assistance of}} producer Frank Marshall, and would purchase the rights to complete and release The Other Side of the Wind. Bogdanovich and Marshall will complete Welles's nearly finished film in Los Angeles, aiming to have <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> for screening May 6, 2015, the 100th anniversary of Welles's birth. Royal Road Entertainment and German producer Jens Koethner Kaul acquired the rights held by Les Films de l'Astrophore and the late Mehdi Boushehri. They reached an agreement with Oja Kodar, who inherited Welles's ownership of the film, and Beatrice Welles, manager of the Welles estate; {{but at the end of}} 2015, efforts to complete the film were at an impasse.|$|E
25|$|This {{building}} was a 1918 motor car garage. At one end it contains restored horse-drawn vehicles. There is {{a reproduction of}} an 1890 garden seat omnibus, with wooden, slatted seats on top, like garden seats. These vehicles have not {{been used in the}} UK since 1931. This reproduction has hydraulic disc brakes for safety. There is a brougham, a 19th-century gentleman's light one-horse carriage. This design {{is said to have been}} named after Lord Chancellor Brougham in the early 19th century. There is also a steamer, or Shand Mason steam fire pump of ca.1880. A team of horses pulled it, and steam powered it, at 250 gallons per minute. Firemen could get <b>it</b> <b>ready</b> in 7 minutes. It was successful enough for the manufacturers to export it worldwide - for example to the Warsaw Fire Guard - but it was expensive in coal and horses, and was superseded by motor pumps in ca.1900.|$|E
