5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) whose job <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> drive the patients {{from place to}} place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, {{although it may be}} acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{sometimes}} {{affected by a}} grey, fuzzy mold called botrytis. Under humid conditions, it is often found growing on the older flowers. Treatment <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> remove the old flowers, so the mold does not spread to the new flowers.|$|E
25|$|One common {{suggestion}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> {{look out}} of the window of the moving vehicle and to gaze towards the horizon in the direction of travel. This helps to re-orient the inner sense of balance by providing a visual reaffirmation of motion.|$|E

25|$|This can be {{attempted}} {{through several}} mechanisms. The most direct strategy <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> buy {{up a large}} percentage of the available commodity offered for sale in some spot market and hoard it. With the advent of futures trading, a cornerer may buy a large number of futures contracts on a commodity and then sell them at a profit after inflating the price.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{the general}} rule for truckers in a right hand driving country is to raise the left hand and to simply open the hand with all fingers {{extended}} without waving it at all with the palm facing forward, known as 'the flat hand'. Or a shorter version <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> extend the fingers while still keeping the palm {{in contact with the}} steering wheel. Raising the right hand is also used in the same way but very rare.|$|E

25|$|Another {{method of}} {{overcoming}} the free rider problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> eliminate the profit incentive for free riding by buying {{out all the}} potential free riders. A property developer that owned an entire city street, for instance, would not {{need to worry about}} free riders when erecting street lights since he owns every business that could benefit from the street light without paying. Implicitly, then, the property developer would erect street lights until the marginal social benefit met the marginal social cost. In this case, they are equivalent to the private marginal benefits and costs.|$|E
25|$|One way to {{represent}} permutations of n is by an integer N with 0nbsp&≤nbsp&Nnbsp&<nbsp&n!, provided convenient methods {{are given to}} convert between the number and the representation of a permutation as an ordered arrangement (sequence). This gives the most compact representation of arbitrary permutations, and in computing is particularly attractive when n is small enough that N can be held in a machine word; for 32-bit words this means nnbsp&≤nbsp&12, and for 64-bit words this means nnbsp&≤nbsp&20. The conversion can be done via the intermediate form of a sequence of numbers d'n, d'n−1, …, d2, d1, where d'i is a non-negative integer less than i (one may omit d1, as it is always 0, but its presence makes the subsequent conversion to a permutation easier to describe). The first step then <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> express N in the factorial number system, {{which is just a}} particular mixed radix representation, where for numbers up to n! the bases for successive digits are n, , …, 2, 1. The second step interprets this sequence as a Lehmer code or (almost equivalently) as an inversion table.|$|E
500|$|In Sonic Boom, {{although}} the two have very strong and obvious feelings for each other, they attempt to conceal them at every possibility. Sonic has a framed portrait of Amy in his home, while Amy carries a picture of Sonic in her purse. Whenever {{one of the two}} shows even the slightest attraction towards anyone else, the other becomes immensely jealous. These hidden feelings are often played with and made to be points of humor and entertainment in the series. In the episode [...] "Tails' Crush", Sonic reveals to Tails that his strategy to attract potential romantic interests <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> act aloof and disinterested, while Amy tells Tails that she's partial to knightly and chivalrous behavior (and thus is likely waiting for Sonic to make the first move). Hence, the two have yet to make their feelings evident.|$|E

2500|$|Cleaning, however, {{can only}} be done {{a certain number of}} times before the ballast is damaged {{to the point that it}} cannot be re-used; furthermore, track ballast that is {{completely}} fouled can not be corrected by shoulder cleaning. [...] In such cases, it is necessary to replace the ballast altogether. One method of [...] "replacing" [...] ballast, if necessity demands, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> dump fresh ballast on the track, jack the whole track on top of it, and then tamp it down; alternatively, the ballast underneath the track can be removed with an undercutter, which does not require removing or lifting the track.|$|E
2500|$|The {{appropriate}} [...] "reference" [...] {{depends on}} the measurement and its goal. The simplest reference measurement <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> remove the sample (replacing it by air). However, sometimes a different reference is more useful. For example, if the sample is a dilute solute dissolved in water in a beaker, then a good reference measurement might be to measure pure water in the same beaker. Then the reference measurement would cancel out not only all the instrumental properties (like what light source is used), but also the light-absorbing and light-reflecting properties {{of the water and}} beaker, and the final result would just show the properties of the solute (at least approximately).|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two main}} methods of obtaining blood from a donor. [...] The most {{frequent}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> take the blood from a vein as whole blood. [...] This blood is typically separated into parts, usually red blood cells and plasma, since most recipients need only a specific component for transfusions. [...] A typical donation is 450 millilitres (or approximately one U.S. pint) of whole blood, though 500 millilitre donations are also common. [...] Historically, blood donors in India would donate only 250 or 350 millilitre and donors in the People's Republic of China would donate only 200 millilitres, though larger 300 and 400 millilitre donations have become more common.|$|E

2500|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, many cyclists choose to convert {{freewheel}} bicycles to fixed gear. Frames with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another {{is to use a}} hub designed for use with a threaded multi-speed freewheel. [...] Such a hub only has the normal right-handed threads for the cog and not the reverse threads for the lockrings used on track/fixed hubs. [...] The sprocket on a hub without a lockring may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket lockring is threaded onto the hub, along with a track sprocket, because the bottom-bracket lockring is not reverse threaded, the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and locknut can unscrew. [...] Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted freewheel hub in case the cog unscrews while back pedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the cog and bottom bracket locking. The rotafix (or [...] "frame whipping") method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket.|$|E
