40|$|Spinity and impelity (Momentity) in {{universe}} Frame dragging {{force is}} a newly identified force. Here, I rename this force “spinity ” or “spinnism ” because this force {{is generated by}} spinning mass. I propose here that “rest mass produces gravity, spinning mass produces spinity; rest charge produces Coulomb electric force, spinning and moving charge produces magnetism”. Frame dragging effect was derived by Dr. Lense and Thirring to describe the procession of an orbiting object using general relativity 1. Nobel prize winner Dr. LD Landau also derived orbiting object’s lagrangian around central spinning mass using general relativity 2. However, these professors didn’t point out that frame dragging is actually a new basic force which has a close relation with gravity. When an object has mass, it will have gravity to attract its parts to the center. In order to overcome this continuously centripetal force, the object needs to spin to produce centrifugal force to balance gravity. When the object spins, spinity occurs. I propose to call this new force “spinity ” {{because it is a}} combination of “spin ” meaning origin of this force and “ity ” meaning basic force. Frame <b>dragging</b> <b>means</b> a spinning mass can drag nearby space-time to rotate around the mass, so it is actually a force which can cause peripheral smaller object to orbit around the central mass according to the basic concept of general relativity. Below is the summary of Professor Landau’s derivation from general relativity: (J:central mass angular momentum,r’=unit vector, vector g direction=Jxr’, vector g is spinity field...|$|E

40|$|The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) {{has been}} seen as an {{alternative}} tool for the computational simulation of fluid dynamics. In this study, we use the LBM with Single-Relaxation-Time (SRT) collision model to simulate two-dimensional (2 D) laminar flow past a square cylinder. The main aim of the study is to systematically investigate the influences of the locations of the inflow, outflow and side walls boundaries, where Reynolds number is kept at 100 for all calculations. The side wall boundary locations will be analyzed using the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions. Analyses of the relaxation time parameter also have been investigated. Some physical quantities, such as the <b>drag</b> coefficient, <b>mean</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient, root <b>mean</b> square values of lift coefficient and the Strouhal number are examined for the purpose. We also examined the vortex shedding formation which provides an excellent means of visualizing the von Karman vortex street. We found that there is a certain range for inflow, outflow and side wall boundaries where physical quantities such as <b>drag</b> and <b>mean</b> <b>drag</b> coefficients, root <b>mean</b> square value of lift coefficient and the Strouhal number show some changes. Results also show that, there is a change for physical quantities when the relaxation time parameter is changed from certain range and also effect the computational time.

It can also affect alfalfa, oats, beans and asparagus crops. The species features strap-like wings edged with long hairs, a design which increases aerodynamic efficiency in very small arthropods; the reduced <b>drag</b> <b>means</b> the insect uses less energy.

Filamentous algae streamers up to 200 mm long have also been observed in the canal. A recirculating water tunnel was used to measure the characteristics of the boundary layer flow over a 997 mm x 597 mm test plate covered with a biofilm grown in the field in an attempt to better understand the mechanisms for the increase in <b>drag.</b> <b>Mean</b> velocity profiles for the fouled test plate have been compared with results for a smooth test plate...|$|R

5000|$|One goal of {{automotive}} aerodynamics {{is to reduce}} the air turbulence, or drag, caused by the shape of the automobile. Aerodynamic drag may be reduced either by reduction of frontal area or by reduction of drag coefficient. In bodies such as automobiles and airships, drag decreases after the rear of a car's cross-sectional area is reduced to fifty percent of the car's maximum cross section; [...] "the best position is nearer 45 per cent of the length, and ... to have this maximum cross- section nearer the rear end than the front, and its drag has proved even less". There are other aspects of the car's design such as keeping the flow of air attached to the body far {{to the back of the}} car as possible to minimize pressure drag (the Bernoulli relationship). A design with less <b>drag</b> <b>means</b> higher efficiency and an increased maximum velocity, given the same powertrain.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the propulsive forces in front crawl arm swimming, {{derived from a}} three-dimensional kinematic analysis, these values were compared with <b>mean</b> <b>drag</b> forces. The propulsive forces during front crawl swimming using the arms only were calculated using three-dimensional kinematic analysis combined with lift and drag coefficients obtained in fluid laboratories. Since, for any constant swimming speed, the mean propulsive force should be equal to the <b>mean</b> <b>drag</b> force acting {{on the body of}} the swimmer, mean values of the calculated propulsive forces were compared with the <b>mean</b> <b>drag</b> forces obtained from measurements on a Measuring Active Drag (MAD) system. The two methods yielded comparable results, the mean difference between them being only 5 % (2 N). We conclude that propulsive forces obtained from three-dimensional kinematic analysis provide realistic values. The calculation of the propulsive force appears to be rather sensitive to the point on the hand at which the velocity is estimated and less sensitive to the orientation of the hand...|$|R
40|$|The near-wake of a vertical-axis {{cross-flow}} turbine (CFT) {{was modeled}} numerically via blade-resolved k-ω SST and Spalart-Allmaras RANS models {{in two and}} three dimensions. Results for each case are compared with experimental measurements of the turbine shaft power, overall <b>drag,</b> <b>mean</b> velocity, turbulence kinetic energy, and momentum transport terms in the near-wake at one diameter downstream. It was shown that 2 -D simulations overpredict turbine loading and do not resolve mean vertical momentum transport, which {{plays an important role}} in the near-wake's momentum balance. The 3 -D simulations fared better at predicting performance, with the Spalart-Allmaras model predictions being closest to the experiments. The SST model more accurately predicted the turbulence kinetic energy while the Spalart-Allmaras model more closely matched the momentum transport terms in the near-wake. These results show the potential of blade-resolved RANS as a design tool and a way to "extrapolate" experimental flow field measurements. Comment: 22 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
50|$|Now {{consider}} the horizontal motion. At the instant {{it leaves the}} shackles, the bomb carries the forward speed of the aircraft with it. This motion is countered solely by drag, which starts to slow the forward motion. As the forward motion slows, the drag force drops and this deceleration diminishes. The forward speed is never reduced entirely to zero. If the bomb was not subject to drag, its path would be purely ballistic and it would impact at an easily calculable point, the vacuum range. In practice, <b>drag</b> <b>means</b> that the impact point is short of the vacuum range, and this real-world distance between dropping and impact is known simply as the range. The difference between the vacuum range and actual range {{is known as the}} trail because the bomb appears to trail behind the aircraft as it falls. The trail and range differ for different bombs due to their individual aerodynamics, and typically have to be measured on a bombing range.|$|R

40|$|The major {{features}} and {{physics of the}} aerodynamic interactions between various main components of a generic four-wheel landing gear are studied. The study was conducted {{as a part of}} the UK ATI ALGAAP (Advanced Landing Gear Aero-loads and Aero-noise Prediction) project. Delayed Detached-Eddy Simulations with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model with fixed laminar-turbulent transition are performed to compare three configurations of landing-gear components. The wheel geometry is the same as in the tandem-wheel configuration that was previously studied for the ALGAAP project. For this geometry both simulations and experiments are available for validation and comparison with the current results on the four-wheel bogie. The effect of the fixed transition are also assessed on the four-wheel geometry and compared with the tandem wheels. The results show strong effects of the axles and the bogie beam on the low past the wheels. The axles generate a wide low-pressure wake in the aft part of the front wheels, which increases the <b>mean</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient of the front wheels. The flow features observed on the three configurations show some similarities with the flow features that were reported on tandem wheels, with a few differences. Adding axles and bogie beam increases the <b>mean</b> <b>drag</b> significantly on the front wheels, and slightly on the downstream wheels. Adding a main strut reduces the <b>mean</b> <b>drag</b> of the downstream wheels, but the <b>mean</b> <b>drag</b> of the front wheels slightly increases. A similar trend is seen with the RMS.

40|$|We {{study the}} drag force {{experienced}} by an object slowly moving at constant velocity through a 2 D granular material consisting of bidisperse disks. The drag force {{is dominated by}} force chain structures in {{the bulk of the}} system, thus showing strong fluctuations. We consider the effect of three important control parameters for the system: the packing fraction, the drag velocity {{and the size of the}} tracer particle. We find that the <b>mean</b> <b>drag</b> force increases as a power-law (exponent of 1. 5) in the reduced packing fraction, (γ - γ_c) /γ_c, as γ passes through a critical packing fraction, γ_c. By comparison, the <b>mean</b> <b>drag</b> grows slowly (basically logarithmic) with the drag velocity, showing a weak rate-dependence. However, the system nevertheless exhibits strong statistical invariance in the sense that many physical quantities collapse onto a single curve under appropriate scaling. We also show that the system can be understood using simple failure models, which reproduce many experimental observations. These experimental data and simulations indicate that fluctuations in the drag force seem to be associated with the force chain formation and breaking in the system. Moreover, our simulations suggest that the logarithmic increase of the <b>mean</b> <b>drag</b> force with rate can be accounted for if slow relaxation of the force chain networks is included.

40|$|Poynting-Robertson drag {{has been}} {{considered}} an ineffective mechanism for delivering dust to regions interior to the cool Kuiper belt analogues seen around other Sun-like stars. This conclusion is however based on the very large contrast in dust optical depth between the parent belt and the interior regions that results from the dominance of collisions over drag in systems with detectable cool belts. Here, we show that the levels of habitable zone dust arising from detectable Kuiper belt analogues can be tens to a few hundreds of {{times greater than the}} optical depth in the Solar Zodiacal cloud. Dust enhancements of more than a few tens of `zodi' are expected to hinder future Earth-imaging missions, but relatively few undetectable Kuiper belts result in such levels, particularly around stars older than a few Gyr. Thus, current mid to far-IR photometric surveys have already identified most of the 20 - 25 % of nearby stars where P-R drag from outer belts could seriously impact Earth-imaging. The LBTI should easily detect such warm dust around many nearby stars with outer belts, and will provide insight into currently unclear details of the competition between P-R drag and collisions. Given sufficient confidence in future models, the inevitability of P-R <b>drag</b> <b>means</b> that the non-detection of warm dust where detectable levels were expected could be used to infer additional dust removal process, the most likely being the presence of intervening planets.

40|$|The mean drag–wind {{relationship}} is usually investigated assuming that field data {{are representative of}} spatially-averaged metrics of statistically stationary flow within and above a horizontally homogeneous canopy. Even if these conditions are satisfied, large-eddy simulation (LES) data suggest two major issues {{in the analysis of}} observational data. Firstly, the streamwise mean pressure gradient is usually neglected in the analysis of data from terrestrial canopies, which compromises the estimates of <b>mean</b> canopy <b>drag</b> and provides misleading information for the dependence of local <b>mean</b> <b>drag</b> coefficients on local velocity scales. Secondly, no standard approach has been proposed to investigate the instantaneous drag–wind relationship, a critical component of canopy representation in LES. Here, a practical approach is proposed to fit the streamwise mean pressure gradient using observed profiles of the mean vertical momentum flux within the canopy. Inclusion of the fitted mean pressure gradient enables reliable estimates of the mean drag–wind relationship. LES data show that a local <b>mean</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient that characterizes the relationship between <b>mean</b> canopy <b>drag</b> and the velocity scale associated with total kinetic energy can be used to identify the dependence of the local instantaneous drag coefficient on instantaneous velocity. Iterative approaches are proposed to fit specific models of velocity-dependent instantaneous drag coefficients that represent the effects of viscous drag and the reconfiguration of flexible canopy elements. LES data are used to verify the assumptions and algorithms employed by these new approaches. The relationship between <b>mean</b> canopy <b>drag</b> and <b>mean</b> velocity, which is needed in models based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, is parametrized to account for both the dependence on velocity and the contribution from velocity variances.
