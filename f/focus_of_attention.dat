5|$|The latter mode {{actually}} is reserved specifically for solo agung contest. Unlike other Southern Filipino groups {{who participate in}} group contest, the Maguindanao are unique in that they also hold solo agung contest {{to find out who}} in the community is the best papagagung (expert agung player). Tidto is prefect for such contest since the agung is often the <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> the focal point during the ensemble during this mode. Players normally perform two or more versions playing the three types of techniques discussed above.|$|E
5|$|Badmotorfinger was {{released}} on September 24, 1991 through A Records. The album peaked at number 39 on the Billboard 200 album chart on February 29, 1992. It {{was released}} nearly one month after Pearl Jam's Ten and {{on the same day}} as Nirvana's Nevermind, all of which helped to break alternative rock and grunge into the mainstream. Although overshadowed {{at the time of its}} release by the sudden popularity of Nirvana's Nevermind, the <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> brought by Nevermind to the Seattle scene helped Soundgarden gain wider attention. Badmotorfinger was among the 100 top selling albums of 1992. Badmotorfinger sold a million copies in the early 1990's, was certified platinum by the RIAA in January 1993 and certified double platinum in April 1996, signifying two million shipped copies.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{praised the}} manga for its {{creativity}} and {{described it as}} a quintessential shōjo manga, as well as a critical work for manga in general. The manga series was awarded the Seiun Award for Best Manga in 2001. The anime television series was praised for transcending its target audience of young children and being enjoyable to older viewers. The artwork in the anime was also a <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> described as above average for a late-1990s TV series, and Sakura's magic-casting scenes were complimented for being nearly unique because of the regular costume changes. The anime television series won the Animage Grand Prix award for Best Anime in 1999. The American edit of Cardcaptors, however, was heavily panned by critics for cutting out character backgrounds essential to understanding the plot.|$|E
5|$|Individuals who are {{intentional}} {{in their}} actions display regularity in their behavior. Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the object, {{and then use}} hands {{to make contact with}} and manipulate the object. Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness. They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.|$|E
5|$|On Edward's {{death in}} 1648, Anthony Hungerford, his half-brother, {{inherited}} the castle. The north chapel was extensively renovated {{during this period}} by Edward's widow, Margaret Hungerford, who covered the walls with pictures of saints, cherubs, clouds, ribbons, crowns and heraldry, {{as part of an}} elaborate tomb for her and Edward which cost £1,100 (£136,000 in 2009 terms). The renovation effectively blocked most of the access into the north chapel, making the new tomb the <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> for any visitor or religious activity. A number of lead, anthropomorphic coffins, some with moulded faces or death masks, were laid down in the crypt in the mid- to late-17th century. Four men, two women and two children were embalmed in the castle in this way, probably including Edward and Margaret, as well as the final Sir Edward Hungerford, his wife, son and daughter-in-law. Such lead coffins were extremely expensive during the period and reserved for the wealthiest in society. Originally the lead coffins would have been encased in wood, but this outer casing has since been lost.|$|E

25|$|The Communists resumed {{development}} of the island along the lines established by the Japanese, but the results were limited by the island's isolation, its humid and typhoon-prone climate, and its continuing reputation {{as a place of}} danger and exile by mainland Chinese.

30|$|This {{distinction}} between perfective and imperfective/future contexts demonstrates that a TOP event must be completed {{for it to}} make the Goal heavily salient for subsequent pronominal reference.

25|$|Recently, eye {{tracking}} {{has been used}} to study online language processing. Beginning with Rayner (1978) the importance and informativity of eye-movements during reading was established. Later, Tanenhaus et al. (1995) used the visual-world paradigm to study the cognitive processes related to spoken language. Assuming that eye movements are closely linked to the current <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> language processing can be studied by monitoring eye movements while a subject is presented auditorily with linguistic input.|$|E

25|$|After his release, Shalit {{returned}} to his parents' home in Mitzpe Hila. His release, the <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> in Israel and abroad, attracted many media outlets and ordinary citizens to Mitzpe Hila. Out of courtesy to Shalit, and given {{the sensitivity of the}} issue, many Israeli media outlets pledged to avoid intensive coverage that may compromise his privacy. Nevertheless, during the days after his release, many reports appeared about him. Shalit was also visited at his home by Israeli President Shimon Peres and French Ambassador Christophe Bigot.|$|E

40|$|Binding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} cognitive functions, how to find the correspondence of sensations between different modalities such as vision and touch. Without a priori knowledge on this correspondence, binding is regarded to be a formidable issue for a robot since it often perceives multiple physical phenomena in its different modal sensors, therefore it should correctly match the <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> in different modalities that may have multiple correspondences each other. We suppose that learning the multimodal representation of the body should be the first step toward binding since the morphological constraints in self-body-observation would make the binding problem tractable. The multimodal sensations are expected to be constrained in perceiving own body so as to configurate the unique parts of the multiple correspondence reflecting its morphology. In this paper, we propose a method to match the <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> in vision and touch through the unique association by cross-anchoring different modalities. Simple experiments show the validity of the proposed method...|$|R

25|$|The insular cortex, in {{particular}} its most anterior portion, {{is considered a}} limbic-related cortex. The insula has increasingly become the <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> for its role in body representation and subjective emotional experience. In particular, Antonio Damasio has proposed that this region {{plays a role in}} mapping visceral states that are associated with emotional experience, giving rise to conscious feelings. This is in essence a neurobiological formulation of the ideas of William James, who first proposed that subjective emotional experience (i.e., feelings) arise from our brain's interpretation of bodily states that are elicited by emotional events. This is an example of embodied cognition.|$|E
25|$|During negotiations, anger {{disrupts}} {{the process by}} reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side. Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains. Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their preferences, it {{increases the likelihood that}} they will reject profitable offers. Opponents who get really angry (or cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors: make sure they are in your favor.|$|E
