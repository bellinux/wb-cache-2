While the focus will largely be on migration patterns in recent decades, it will first be necessary to review earlier patterns of mobility which have {{had a role in}} shaping current routes and modes of migration. I use two concepts to frame my discussion: Foucault 2 ̆ 7 s concept of 2 ̆ 2 biopower 2 ̆ 2 and an adaptation of Connell 2 ̆ 7 s concept of the 2 ̆ 2 <b>global</b> <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> 2 ̆ 2, which I will reframe as 2 ̆ 2 the global order of difference 2 ̆ 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{signs of}} a {{transition}} in the <b>global</b> <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> appear, in part, {{to be linked to}} the conjunctural shift in the global capitalist accumulation process. The main observation is that men’s traditional roles in the workplace, at home and in school have been eroding with the shift towards a knowledge-based and services world-economy. However, the transition in the gender order is more than merely a matter of economic adjustment and industrial respecialization. The transition {{has much to do with}} the impact of the antisystemic movements and changes in the politics of identity such as the rise of feminism and the women’s movement, the feminization of both male consumption culture and the workplace, the gay rights movement and the resistance to empire and racialized masculinities (Nurse 2004). These trends have evoked a counter-movement and a counter-discourse on male marginalization, demasculinization and the feminization of masculinity in core countries (Bly 1990) as well as in peripheral areas (Miller 1991). The erosion of the male superiority myth has specifically affected the hegemonic status of the white male subject. ...|$|E
40|$|Any {{observer}} of the recent politics and economics of Western democratic states will {{be familiar with the}} starting point of this collection: {{that there has been a}} significant shift in governing practices related to global economic restructuring, informed by a 2 ̆ 2 neo-liberal consensus 2 ̆ 2 that favors shrinking government and deregulating economies. This book tackles the implications of this trend in Canada, but with the specific aim of demonstrating the simultaneous 2 ̆ 2 gender erosion and intensification 2 ̆ 2 integral to restructuring. Isabella Bakker has assembled some of Canada 2 ̆ 7 s finest feminist scholars to explore the often contradictory effects of current political-economic strategies on the Canadian (and <b>global)</b> <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> and, as a result, provides a significant challenge to the assumptions underlying the 2 ̆ 2 neoliberal 2 ̆ 2 consensus. Bakker 2 ̆ 7 s excellent introduction sets out the epistemological presuppositions of a focus on gender as a category of analysis, offers an overview of key shifts in Canada 2 ̆ 7 s policy environment, and effectively contextualizes and previews the specific issues to be explored by the contributors to the collection...|$|E

30|$|The {{move from}} {{housewife}} to full-time wife signals the changing <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> in China. Housewife was a stigmatized label in the Maoist era, which emphasized gender equality, and where women {{were expected to}} take part in work rather than stay at home to be fed by others. At that time, the traditional <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> in the family was neglected and repressed. The term full-time wife embodies an acceptance of the traditional <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> in the family and also the gender inequality in the labor market, which reflects a combination of the traditional <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> in the private sphere and the market-constructed <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> in the public sphere.|$|R

30|$|Giddens (2003) {{advanced}} {{the concept of}} <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> but did not offer a precise definition. It is clearly related to concepts such as gender relations, gender inequality, gender differences, gender socialization, and masculinity and femininity. Based on these concepts, <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> may {{be defined as the}} different characters, roles, and modes of action for men and women that are specified by culture, customs, political economy, and the social structure, including social policy. In this paper, the term “gender order” is used specifically to highlight the female roles formed by culture, regulation, and access to resources. Four types of <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> are discussed in this paper: 1) traditional <b>gender</b> <b>order,</b> also called private patriarchy and constructed with reference to Confucianism, that advocates “man responsible for the outside, woman responsible for the inside” (Nan zhu wai, niu zhu nei, 男主外,女主内); 2) state-constructed <b>gender</b> <b>order,</b> also called state patriarchy, that advocates “woman exactly like man in public areas”; 3) market-constructed <b>gender</b> <b>order,</b> also called capitalist patriarchy, that is characterized by discrimination against women in paid employment; and 4) modern equal-gender order or equality based on woman’s subjectivity and constructed in terms of equality with difference. Thus, although similar to terms such as “gender inequality” and “gender hierarchy,” “gender order” comprises a multidimensional framework that identifies different social constructions of {{the role of women in}} relation to men.|$|R

30|$|The {{state did}} much to release Chinese women from the {{traditional}} <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> (kinship patriarchy) in the Maoist period, but women were pushed into the public sphere of labor and politics (Yang 1999). In the market transformation period, the state {{is still one of}} the most important sources of ensuring equality in the <b>gender</b> <b>order.</b> Instead of rolling back the state in this area, the state’s responsibility should be reemphasized. In the future women’s subjectivity, traditional culture, the state, and the market will further impact each other, and the state should be more active in constructing a new <b>gender</b> <b>order.</b>|$|R

50|$|The World Economic Forum's 2014 <b>Global</b> <b>Gender</b> Gap Report, {{measuring}} {{the allocation of}} resources {{between women and men}} in health, education, economy and politics, ranked Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark highest on their <b>Global</b> <b>Gender</b> Gap Index, while Yemen, Pakistan, Chad, Syria and Mali were among those ranked the lowest. Globally, the health and survival gap was 96% and the educational attainment gap was 94%, with some countries closing the gap entirely. However, the gap related to improvement for women in the workplace was found to be 60%, having closed by only 4% since 2006.

30|$|When a {{woman has}} a {{position}} in the labor market that matches that of her husband, what impact does the traditional <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> have on her job prospects? This type of forced resignation reflects the reemergence of the traditional <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> in the period of market transformation. Strong pressure is put on the woman to abandon her commitment to employment through a combination of complaints from her husband and her own feelings of guilt and anxiety. The result is that she gives up the pursuit of a career and submits to her family’s requirements. The woman’s employment-related goals are subordinated to the traditional <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> in the family.|$|R

30|$|Under {{the strong}} {{pressure}} of the traditional <b>gender</b> <b>order,</b> Mrs. Hu gave up her high-status job and hopes to find one that will allow her to {{take good care of}} her family: “Yes, I had a high salary at that period, but I thought it was not good for my family, especially given such machismo in my husband. I will take good care of my family, and I think I can spend less time on my son as he grows up” (Mrs. Hu). The traditional <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> created a paradox in this case: her husband was a university teacher but was unwilling to care for his family; however, she is expected to do so when she becomes a university teacher. It is likely that, even when both of them are university teachers, there will be different approaches to paid work because of the unequal <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> for men and women. The wife has {{to pay more attention to}} the family and give less attention to her job. This will create a barrier to women’s improvement in career terms and disadvantage women in the long term. The <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> in the labor market (capitalist patriarchy) was reinforced by traditional <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> in the family (private patriarchy).|$|R
30|$|The core issue {{discussed}} in the literature is how to balance work and family. The literature review is organized along two lines: one is the experience in Western countries, {{the other is the}} experience of Chinese women from 1949 to the economic transformation period. Using the core conception of <b>gender</b> <b>order,</b> the rest of this article examines the impact on women of social policy in China from the Maoist era to the market transformation. In the Maoist period, the state brought greatly improved equality to the public <b>gender</b> <b>order,</b> but the state’s strong intervention affected women’s choices and freedom. In the post-Maoist period, the state rolled back too many regulations that ensured gender fairness, which created difficulties for women in balancing work and family. This work presents the full-time wife’s situation in the context of <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> change and especially the reasons behind the choice. Based on an empirical study of the changes in <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> in present-day China, we argue that instead of holding back the policies that ensure gender equality, the state should remain the key guarantor of equality in the <b>gender</b> <b>order.</b> The question of how to reconcile family and paid work should be reconsidered in China. Lessons can be drawn from both the danwei system and family policies in Western countries.|$|R

30|$|Another {{respondent}} {{stated that}} “suppression of myself {{is the greatest}} impact brought by marriage. That is, sometimes you will transform your role slowly, feel you are a woman behind a man” (Ms. Liu). The disadvantaged {{role of women in}} the traditional <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> does not change because of improved economic conditions since women may no longer be disadvantaged in terms of material living standards (depending on the distribution of resources within the family), but are still inferior in terms of self-fulfillment. Women’s suppression resulting from the traditional <b>gender</b> <b>order</b> occurs independently of economic factors, and in the background of market transformation, economic factors sometimes become a powerful support of the traditional <b>gender</b> <b>order.</b>|$|R
