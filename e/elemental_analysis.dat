2500|$|A third {{step was}} the {{structure}} elucidation of organic substances: although the elemental composition of pure organic substances (irrespective {{of whether they}} were of natural or synthetic origin) could be determined fairly accurately, the molecular structure was still a problem. The urge to do structural elucidation resulted from a dispute between Friedrich Wöhler and Justus von Liebig, who both studied a silver salt of the same composition but had different properties. Wöhler studied silver cyanate, a harmless substance, while von Liebig investigated silver fulminate, a salt with explosive properties. The <b>elemental</b> <b>analysis</b> shows that both salts contain equal quantities of silver, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. According to the then prevailing ideas, both substances should possess the same properties, {{but this was not}} the case. This apparent contradiction was later solved by Berzelius's theory of isomers, whereby not only the number and type of elements are of importance to the properties and chemical reactivity, but also the position of atoms in within a compound. This was a direct cause for the development of structure theories, such as the radical theory of Jean-Baptiste Dumas and the substitution theory of Auguste Laurent. [...] However, it took until 1858 before by August Kekulé formulated a definite structure theory. He posited that carbon tetravalent ad can bind itself to carbon chains as they occur in natural products.|$|E
