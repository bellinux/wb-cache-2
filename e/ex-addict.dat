These familiars, animals that accompany the repentant criminal for life, also grant their host a magical power as a sort of reward for their processing of guilt. This externalization of guilt, however, results in the discrimination and ghettoisation of the individuals dubbed ‘animalled zoos’ in a way that inevitably recalls Apartheid. Beukes is herself a white writer whereas her protagonist, Zinzi December, is a black ex-journalist and <b>ex-addict,</b> ‘animalled’ for indirectly causing the death of her brother. Yet, comments on race are missing in the novel, in which characters are described with no reference at all to their skin colour and in which ‘racist’ is used meaning ‘anti-animalled. ’ This absence of comment is even stranger if we consider that the neighbourhood nicknamed ‘Zoo City’ in the novel is actually inner-city Hillbrow.

40|$|Background: Benzodiazepines (BZD) misuse is {{a serious}} public health problem, {{especially}} among opiatedependent patients with anxiety enrolled in methadone program because it puts patients at higher risk of lifethreatening multiple drug overdoses.

40|$|In a book sure {{to inspire}} controversy, Gene Heyman argues that {{conventional}} wisdom about addiction—that it is a disease, a compulsion beyond conscious control—is wrong. Drawing on psychiatric epidemiology, addicts’ autobiographies, treatment studies, and advances in behavioral economics, Heyman makes a powerful case that addiction is voluntary. He shows that drug use, like all choices, {{is influenced by}} preferences and goals. But {{just as there are}} successful dieters, there are successful <b>ex-addicts.</b> In fact, addiction is the psychiatric disorder with the highest rate of recovery. But what ends an addiction? At the heart of Heyman’s analysis is a startling view of choice and motivation that applies to all choices, not just the choice to use drugs. The conditions that promote quitting a drug addiction include new information, cultural values, and, of course, {{the costs and benefits of}} further drug use. Most of us avoid becoming drug dependent, not because we are especially rational, but because we loathe the idea of being an addict. Heyman’s analysis of well-established but frequently ignored research leads to unexpected insights into how we make choices—from obesity to McMansionization—all rooted in our deep-seated tendency to consume too much of whatever we like best. As wealth increases and technology advances, the dilemma posed by addictive drugs spreads to new products. However, this remarkable and radical book points to a solution. If drug addicts typically beat addiction, then non-addicts can learn to control their natural tendency to take too much...|$|R
40|$|Aims: It is {{the goal}} of this study to {{investigate}} the first development of the drug-free therapeutic community (TC) in Central, Northern and Southern Europe. The paper aims at systemizing information, scattered all over Europe and is the first stage in an ongoing study to record the development of the European TC movement and its influences. Design: After a study of grey (hidden) literature, TC pioneers and experts per country were contacted to further elaborate our first findings. Subsequently, a preliminary summary of our findings was published in the Newsletter of the European Federation of Therapeutic Communities (EFTC), inviting additional information and corrections. This led to a simple questionnaire, which was sent back to the original pioneers, experts and made electronically public to the larger TC forum. A series of interviews was scheduled with missing key figures and protagonists. Findings: This led to a systematic overview of facts concerning the foundation, networks, professional standards, ideological background and further dispersion of the TC in European countries and regions. Knowledge, up until now only orally communicated within the closed TC circles, and the – primarily in grey literature – sparsely distributed information was made public. As the pioneers grow older, it may be assumed that the findings of this article saved otherwise lost information for the future.

This study focuses on the reasons for, {{and the consequences of}} teenage drug abuse in one school in the Northern Areas of Port Elizabeth. The main aim {{of this study was to}} formulate strategies which school managers can use to alleviate the problem of drug abuse among learners. A naturalistic approach was followed to conduct qualitative research. The research design used is a case study. Data-collection techniques consisted of semi-structured and unstructured interviews, observations and questionnaires. Respondents consisted of 150 learners, 5 parents, 10 educators from the school, 2 social workers and 1 auxiliary social worker, 2 priests involved in Youth Ministry, 1 adult involved in running a drug rehabilitation centre, and 1 <b>ex-addict</b> who is involved in arranging drug awareness campaigns and rehabilitation programs. This study found family aspects and family dynamics, personal aspects and the self-concept of the teenager, and societal or environmental aspects to be the main reasons for teenage drug abuse. Drugs have an adverse effect on the community within which the abuse is occurring. It also has a negative effect on the health, psychological state, behaviour and the family of the teenager. Strategies to alleviate the problem emphasise the role which the school can play in terms of drug education for educators, learners and parents; the role of the Government in allocating additional funds for drug education; the role which the church can play in terms of drug education and providing opportunities for positive interactions with peers; and the role which the media can play in influencing the decisions of teenager...|$|E

The authors completed the results for this article with relevant first-hand information, obtained through interviews with European pioneers. Findings: The findings are summarized under three topics: chronology, interconnections and European identity. It was found that from 1968 until 1989, a new therapeutic approach arose all over Europe, modeled after Synanon, Daytop and Phoenix House, New York, through Phoenix House, London and Emiliehoeve in the Netherlands. Therapeutic communities were established in Belgium, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland as well.
