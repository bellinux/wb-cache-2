5|$|Iridium {{is used in}} {{particle}} physics {{for the production of}} antiprotons, a form of antimatter. Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a conversion target, which needs to be made from a very high density material. Although tungsten may be used instead, iridium has the advantage of better stability under the shock waves induced by the temperature rise due to the <b>incident</b> <b>beam.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Laue back {{reflection}} mode records X-rays scattered backwards {{from a broad}} spectrum source. This is useful if the sample is too thick for X-rays to transmit through it. The diffracting planes in the crystal are determined by knowing that the normal to the diffracting plane bisects the angle between the <b>incident</b> <b>beam</b> and the diffracted beam. A Greninger chart {{can be used to}} interpret the {{back reflection}} Laue photograph.|$|E
5|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the green}} part of the spectrum are widely available {{to the general public}} {{in a wide range of}} output powers. Green laser pointers outputting at 532nm (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state (DPSS) technology to create the green light. An infrared laser diode at 808nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the <b>incident</b> <b>beam</b> (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532nm ("green"). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501nm to 543nm. Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers, including the helium–neon laser (543nm), the Argon-ion laser (514nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521nm and 531nm), as well as liquid dye lasers. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, laser light shows, spectroscopy, interferometry, fluorescence, holography, machine vision, non-lethal weapons and bird control.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} microinterferometers {{and the application}} of such to profile surface geometries. A representative method for profiling a target surface of an object includes: illuminating the target surface with an <b>incident</b> light <b>beam</b> through a phase-sensitive, reflective diffraction grating, such that a first portion of the <b>incident</b> light <b>beam</b> is reflected and a second portion of the <b>incident</b> light <b>beam</b> is diffracted upon being transmitted through the diffraction grating; receiving interference patterns produced from the first portion of he <b>incident</b> light <b>beam</b> reflected from the diffraction grating interfering with the second portion of the <b>incident</b> light <b>beam</b> reflected from the target surface; measuring the intensity of the interference patterns to determine the distance to determine the distance between a reference point and the surface; varying the position of the object relative to the diffraction grating; and processing the measured distances to profile the surface of the object.

25|$|For a given {{metal and}} {{frequency}} of incident radiation, {{the rate at which}} photoelectrons are ejected is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident light. An increase in the intensity of the <b>incident</b> <b>beam</b> (keeping the frequency fixed) increases the magnitude of the photoelectric current, although the stopping voltage remains the same.|$|E
25|$|The {{incoming}} beam {{is shaped}} by slits of a few tens of micrometers such that the transverse coherence length {{is greater than the}} grating period. The interferometer consists of three parallel and equally spaced phase gratings, and an x-ray camera. The <b>incident</b> <b>beam</b> is diffracted by a first grating of period 2P into two beams. These are further diffracted by a second grating of period P into four beams. Two of the four merge at a third grating of period 2P. Each is further diffracted by the third grating. The multiple diffracted beams are allowed to propagate for sufficient distance such that the different diffraction orders are separated at the camera. There exists a pair of diffracted beams that co-propagate from the third grating to the camera. They interfere with each other to produce intensity fringes if the gratings are slightly misaligned with each other. The central pair of diffraction paths are always equal in length regardless of the x-ray energy or the angle of the <b>incident</b> <b>beam.</b> The interference patterns from different photon energes and incident angles are locked in phase.|$|E
50|$|Not only volume {{crystals}} can be imaged by topography, {{but also}} crystalline layers on a foreign substrate. For very thin layers, the scattering volume {{and thus the}} diffracted intensities are very low. In these cases, topographic imaging is therefore a rather demanding task, unless <b>incident</b> <b>beams</b> with very high intensities are available.|$|R

25|$|Electromagnetic waves {{which have}} a {{component}} of their electric fields aligned parallel to the wires will induce the movement of electrons {{along the length of}} the wires. Since the electrons are free to move in this direction, the polarizer behaves in a similar manner to the surface of a metal when reflecting light, and the wave is reflected backwards along the <b>incident</b> <b>beam</b> (minus a small amount of energy lost to Joule heating of the wire).|$|E
25|$|A {{more useful}} {{polarized}} beam {{can be obtained}} by tilting the pile of plates at a steeper angle to the <b>incident</b> <b>beam.</b> Counterintuitively, using incident angles greater than Brewster's angle yields a higher degree of polarization of the transmitted beam, at the expense of decreased overall transmission. For angles of incidence steeper than 80° the polarization of the transmitted beam can approach 100% with as few as four plates, although the transmitted intensity is very low in this case. Adding more plates and reducing the angle allows a better compromise between transmission and polarization to be achieved.|$|E
25|$|For a given metal, {{there exists}} a certain minimum {{frequency}} of incident radiation below which no photoelectrons are emitted. This frequency is called the threshold frequency. Increasing {{the frequency of the}} <b>incident</b> <b>beam,</b> keeping the number of incident photons fixed (this would result in a proportionate increase in energy) increases the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons emitted. Thus the stopping voltage increases. The number of electrons also changes because the probability that each photon results in an emitted electron is a function of photon energy. If the intensity of the incident radiation of a given frequency is increased, there is no effect on the kinetic energy of each photoelectron.|$|E

25|$|A simple linear {{polarizer}} {{can be made}} by tilting a stack of glass plates at Brewster's angle to the beam. Some of the s-polarized light is reflected from each surface of each plate. For a stack of plates, each reflection depletes the <b>incident</b> <b>beam</b> of s-polarized light, leaving a greater fraction of p-polarized light in the transmitted beam at each stage. For visible light in air and typical glass, Brewster's angle is about 57°, and about 16% of the s-polarized light present in the beam is reflected for each air-to-glass or glass-to-air transition. It takes many plates to achieve even mediocre polarization of the transmitted beam with this approach. For a stack of 10 plates (20 reflections), about 3% (=(1-0.16)20) of the s-polarized light is transmitted. The reflected beam, while fully polarized, is spread out and may not be very useful.|$|E
25|$|Crystal interferometry, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} X-ray interferometry, {{is the oldest}} but also the most complex method used for experimental realization.

The second crystal (T) acts as a transmission mirror and causes the beams to converge one towards another. The two beams meet at {{the plane of the}} third crystal (A), which is sometimes called, the analyzer crystal, and create an interference pattern the form of which depends on the optical path difference between the two beams caused by the sample. This interference pattern is detected with an X-ray detector behind the analyzer crystal.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} numerically {{the interactions}} of two in-phase and out-of-phase Airy beams and nonlinear accelerating beams in Kerr and saturable nonlinear media, in one transverse dimension. We find that bound and unbound soliton pairs, as well as single solitons, can form in such interactions. If the interval between two <b>incident</b> <b>beams</b> is large relative to the width of their first lobes, the generated soliton pairs just propagate individually and do not interact. However, if the interval {{is comparable to the}} widths of the maximum lobes, the pairs interact and display varied behavior.
