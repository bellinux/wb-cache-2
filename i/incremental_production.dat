5000|$|From 2001 through 2010, the Philippines {{production}} of abaca fiber (Manila hemp) averaged 65,701 mt {{per year and}} was decreasing {{at a rate of}} at least 0.8% per annum. The decrease was caused by the devastating typhoons in 2006, abaca viral diseases that continued to affect the plantations, and the dampened foreign demand brought about by the global economic recession beginning {{in the latter part of}} 2008, the most severe downturn since the Great Depression in the 1930s. Production reached its peak in 2008 at 77,387 mt as outputs of all producing regions, particularly Bicol, Davao Region and Caraga, substantially increased during the period. This was primarily the effect of the <b>incremental</b> <b>production</b> from the abaca plantations established in 2005 and 2006 under FIDA's program Goal I [...] "Development of New Agri-Business Lands" [...] and the continued strong demand and attractive prices offered for the fiber by local traders, processors/manufacturers, and exporters. The abaca industry, however, suffered a setback in 2009 when fiber yield slumped to its lowest level of 54,584 mt due to the weakened market demand and falling prices as a consequence of the worldwide financial crisis. Catanduanes Island is the native habitat of the endemic abaca plant (a banana relative) which is globally renowned for its strong fiber.

40|$|The {{choice of}} EOR {{techniques}} {{should be based}} on knowledge of prior efforts in similar settings. The Minnelusa Formation of Wyoming offers such an opportunity. The formation is a prolific producer with over 607 million barrels of oil cumulative to date from approximately 100 Minnelusa fields located in the Powder River basin. These fields are relatively small, eolian sandstone deposits with similar porosity and permeability, but have a wide range of production by field. About half of these fields have been subjected to some form of enhanced oil recovery, primarily with polymer floods. While some of these fields followed the traditional EOR sequence of primary, secondary and tertiary treatment, there were many cases where application of polymer was coincident with start of waterflooding. An evaluation of the effectiveness of all phases of recovery was performed using production data. The metric used was the <b>incremental</b> <b>production</b> after treatment where incremental was limited to that oil produced in addition to normal production activities. This metric provides the basis for estimating potential income to pay for the treatment. Almost all cases of water or chemical flooding produced positive results in terms of increased oil production.

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of infill well production is crucial since the expected amount of <b>incremental</b> <b>production</b> {{is used in}} the decision-making process to choose the best infill locations. Making a good decision requires taking into account all possible outcomes and so it is necessary to quantify the uncertainty in forecasts. Many researchers have addressed the infill well location selection problem previously.

In this study, a reservoir simulation based approach was used to select infill well locations. I used multiple reservoir realizations to take different possible outcomes into consideration, generated probabilistic distributions of incremental field production and, finally, used descriptive statistical analysis to evaluate results. I quantified the uncertainty associated with infill location selection in terms of incremental field production and validated the approach on a synthetic reservoir model.

The mature gas fields {{rehabilitation}} {{represents a}} permanent {{concern of the}} Romgaz technical management, being {{considered one of the}} major priority of the development strategy of our company. The most part of our gas fields located in the geological unit of Transylvanian Basin are characterized by an advanced stage of exploitation, with a long production history and high cumulatives, having a current recovery factors of more than 60 - 70 %. This status gives them the name "mature fields", or "brownfields" concepts logically associated with another notion, called "rehabilitation", also very frequently used in the world oil and gas industry. As the production decreasing became actually more obviously, due to the natural energetic decline of the reservoirs, the only viable solution to overcome this, consists in finding technical, commercial and operational best practices designed to develop <b>incremental</b> <b>production</b> and access additional reserves.

40|$|This investigative study {{presents}} {{results on}} the socioeconomic impact of infill drilling recovery from carbonate reservoirs in the Permian Basin. The amount of incremental {{oil and gas production}} from infill drilling in 37 carbonate reservoir units is established using decline curve analysis. The increase in incremental recovery is used to compute the amount of increased revenue and taxes (local, state and federal). A job market analysis is performed to determine the impact of these increased revenues on primary jobs in the oil industry and secondary jobs in the community. Secondary jobs are generated by oil industry workers spending money in the community. The appropriation of the estimated taxes is analyzed to determine which government agencies benefit most from the infill drilling. The observations from this research are that most of the San Andres and Clearfork carbonate reservoir units in the Permian Basin are potentially profitable to infill drill. The incremental oil and gas production from infill drilling could maintain or create many primary jobs within the local oil industry and also secondary jobs in the community.

40|$|Previous work on English {{suggests}} that accessibility of individual lexical items {{plays an important}} role in shaping speakers’ choice of sentence structure, providing evidence for lexically <b>incremental</b> <b>production.</b> In order to investigate the role of accessibility in cross-linguistic production, we manipulated accessibility in English and Korean via semantic priming in Experiment 1 and visual cueing in Experiment 2. We recorded English and Korean speakers’ speech and eye movements as they described pictured events. The production results show that English speakers’ choice of sentence structure was significantly affected by semantic priming or visual cueing, consistent with the findings of prior research: Priming the patient entity significantly increased the production of passive sentences. In contrast, Korean speakers’ choice of sentence structure was not influenced by accessibility of lexical items. Analyses of participants’ eye-movements are consistent with the production results. In Experiment 1, English speakers fixated the semantically primed entity in the visual scene, whereas Korean speakers did not. Even when the visual cueing manipulation drew Korean speakers’ focus of attention toward the cued entity in Experiment 2, Korean speakers’ choice of the first referent was not influenced by the lexical accessibility. These findings strongly suggest that lexically <b>incremental</b> <b>production</b> is not a universal production mechanism.

It suggests that when the conductivity of fracture network approaches 4 mD ft, any decrease in fracture conductivity would result in a well productivity reduction.|$|R

This approach is shown in Fig.  1 a. As the gas rate and the bottom hole flowing pressure values are stabilized, this method can provide the value of productivity accurately. Having a low-permeability gas reservoir, given that the gas flow rate increases in each working system, it requires a long time for stabilization and vents a large amount of gases, which is detrimental for the environment.
