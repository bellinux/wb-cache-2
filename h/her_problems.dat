Steph told Max that he and Tom were now her family, a family further bonded when he proposed marriage. Steph becomes friends with Niall, who fell for her, although she saw him more as someone to confide <b>her</b> <b>problems</b> in. Max began to see Steph as selfish and only interested in her career and money, which led to several arguments between the pair. One day, he caught her alone with Niall, wearing only a shirt. She'd spilled something on her dress, but he assumed the worst and they broke up. A few days later {{she went back to}} Niall's place and they kissed, but were interrupted by his room-mate.|$|E
5|$|To {{help with}} the {{stresses}} of her various issues – understanding her new relationship with Grayson, dealing with Travis leaving for college, and trying to fit Bobby into her life – Jules (Courteney Cox) has started {{to see a new}} therapist, Glenn (Jennifer Aniston). Jules is able to relate well to Glenn, particularly because Glenn seems to have a mother-son bond with her son, Gabriel, as close as Jules has with Travis. Ellie (Christa Miller) is skeptical about Glenn's qualifications, and jealous that Jules now prefers to talk about <b>her</b> <b>problems</b> with Glenn instead of her.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Monroe {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coaches—first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasberg—also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and stage fright; she disliked the lack of control she had on her work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated <b>her</b> <b>problems,</b> although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According to Sarah Churchwell, some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.|$|E

5|$|Ferdinando beseeched Louis XIV to do {{something}} about his daughter-in-law's behaviour; he sent the Comte de Saint Mêmê. Marguerite Louise wanted to return to France, and Mêmê sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he left without finding a solution to the heir's domestic disharmony, incensing both Ferdinando and Louis XIV. She humiliated Cosimo at every chance she got: she insisted on employing French cooks, as she feared the Medici would poison her. In September 1664 Marguerite Louise abandoned her apartments in the Pitti, the grand ducal palace. Cosimo moved her into Villa Lapeggi. Here, she was watched by forty soldiers, and six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere. The next year she reconciled with the grand ducal family, and gave birth to Anna Maria Luisa, future Electress Palatine, in August 1667. The delicate rapprochement that existed between Marguerite Louise {{and the rest of the}} family collapsed after Anna Maria Luisa's birth, when Marguerite Louise caught smallpox and decided to blame Cosimo for all <b>her</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E

25|$|Tsukuru stays {{alone with}} Kuro, now a {{successful}} pottery artist. Eri prefers {{to dispense with}} nicknames and explains that Yuzu was mentally ill. The rape accusation was a fabrication, but he was cut off {{as a way of}} not frontally contradicting Yuzu to enable her to deal with <b>her</b> <b>problems.</b> Eri reveals that {{she was in love with}} Tsukuru, which could have played a role in the accusation, but also that Yuzu was actually raped and had a miscarriage, then developed anorexia as a way of never being pregnant again. Eri told him nothing, maybe because he never noticed her love, but mostly to prevent a confrontation with Yuzu. Tsukuru was sacrificed to protect Yuzu because the group believed he was the strongest emotionally and could deal with the ban. These redemptive revelations give the lie to Tsukuru's own perception of himself as plain and colorless.|$|E

A psychiatrist from Glenside Mental Health Service, a campus of the Royal Adelaide Hospital, was told about Anna's behaviour, and said that <b>her</b> <b>problems</b> were behavioural, and not mental-health related. The Rural and Remote Mental Health Service (RRMHS) offered a videoconference, but Baxter officials instead wanted Anna to be admitted to a hospital, because they believed that she would not cooperate with a video assessment.
