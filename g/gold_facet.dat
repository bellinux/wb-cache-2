Using DFT periodic calculations in presence of adsorbed CO the segregation behavior of group 9 - 10 - 11 transition metals (Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni, Ir, Rh, Co) substituted in semi-infinite gold surfaces is investigated. Although, CO is found to be more strongly adsorbed on (100) than on the (111) surface, the segregation of M impurities is found to be more pronounced on the (111) surface. The results reveal two competitive effects: the effect of M on CO and the effect of CO on M. Thus, on one hand, if M exists on the (100) <b>gold</b> <b>facet,</b> CO would be strongly adsorbed on it. But if M is initially located in the bulk, it would segregate to the (111) facet instead of the (100) in order to bind to CO...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} activity of well-defined gold nanorods enclosed by Au(111) and Au(100) surfaces is investigated for the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction between phenylacetylene and 4 -iodoanisole, which {{gives rise to}} two homo-coupling products (diphenyldiacetylene, PhC C-C Ph and 4, 4 '-dimethox y- 1, 1 '-biphenyl, MeOC 6 H 4 -C 6 H 4 OMe) and a cross-coupling product (1 -methoxy- 4 -(2 -phenylethynyl) ben zene, Ph CC 6 H 4 OMe). This study shows that shorter nanorods (similar to 33 nm) with {{a higher percentage of}} Au(111) surface are considerably more selective toward the cross-coupling product (57 % conversion with 90 % selectivity). The selectivity of longer nanorods (e. g., 42 and 50 nm) with a higher percentage of Au(100) surface, as well as of corresponding shapeless gold nanoparticles (e. g., 2 - 4 and 20 nm), is found to be less than 59 %. The catalytic mechanism of the homo- and cross-coupling reactions, in particular, roles played by Au(100) and Au(111) surfaces, is examined via OFT simulation. It is found that iodobenzene adsorption, C-I bond dissociation, reactant surface diffusion, and coupling reactions are more favorable on Au(111) than on Au(100). This work demonstrates the <b>gold</b> <b>facet</b> effect on catalytic coupling reactions, and the combined approach of experiment and theory permits mechanistic understanding at the molecular level.

40|$|The RPAR peptide, a {{prototype}} C-end Rule (CendR) sequence that binds to neuropilin- 1 (NRP- 1), has potential therapeutic uses as internalization trigger in anticancer nanodevices. Recently, the functionalization of gold nanoparticles with CendR peptides {{has been proved}} to be a successful strategy to target the NRP- 1 receptor in prostate cancer cells. In this work, we investigate the influence of two <b>gold</b> surface <b>facets,</b> (100) and (111), on the conformational preferences of RPAR using molecular dynamics simulations. Both clustering and conformational analyses revealed that the peptide backbone becomes very rigid upon adsorption onto gold, which is a very fast and favored process, the only flexibility being attributed to the side chains of the two Arg residues. Thus, the different components of RPAR tend to adopt an elongated shape, which is characterized by the pseudo-extended conformation of both the backbone and the Arg side chains. This conformation {{is very different from the}} already known bioactive conformation, indicating that RPAR is drastically affected by the substrate. Interestingly, the preferred conformations of the peptide adsorbed onto <b>gold</b> <b>facets</b> are not stabilized by salt bridges and/or specific intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which represent an important difference with respect to the conformations found in other environments (e. g. the peptide in solution and interacting with NRP- 1 receptor). However, the conformational changes induced by the substrate are not detrimental for the use of gold nanoparticles as appropriate vehicles for the transport and targeted delivery of the RPAR. Thus, once their high affinity for the NRP- 1 receptor induces the targeted delivery of the elongated peptide molecules from the gold nanoparticles, the lack of intramolecular interactions facilitates their evolution towards the bioactive conformation, increasing the therapeutic efficacy of the peptide.

40|$|Peptide {{sequences}} {{that can}} discriminate between <b>gold</b> <b>facets</b> under aqueous conditions offer a promising route {{to control the}} growth and organisation of biomimetically-synthesised gold nanoparticles. Knowledge of the interplay between sequence, conformations and interfacial properties is essential for predictable manipulation of these biointerfaces, but the structural connections between a given peptide sequence and its binding affinity remain unclear, impeding practical advances in the field. These structural insights, at atomic-scale resolution, are not easily accessed with experimental approaches, but can be delivered via molecular simulation. A current unmet challenge lies in forging links between predicted adsorption free energies derived from enhanced sampling simulations with the conformational ensemble of the peptide and the water structure at the surface. To meet this challenge, here we use an in situ combination of Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering with Metadynamics simulations to predict the adsorption free energy of a gold-binding peptide sequence, AuBP 1, at the aqueous Au(111), Au(100) (1 × 1) and Au(100) (5 × 1) interfaces. We find adsorption to the Au(111) surface is stronger than to Au(100), irrespective of the reconstruction status of the latter. Our predicted free energies agree with experiment, and correlate with trends in interfacial water structuring. For gold, surface hydration is predicted as a chief determining factor in peptide-surface recognition. Our findings {{can be used to}} suggest how shaped seed-nanocrystals of Au, in partnership with AuBP 1, could be used to control AuNP nanoparticle morphology...|$|R

The surface dynamics is interpreted considering the anodic and cathodic reaction pathways recently proposed complemented with concurrent relaxation phenomena occurring after gold (111) lattice mild disruption (one gold atom deep) and moderate disruption (several atoms deep). The dynamics of both oxidized and reduced gold topographies {{depends on the}} potentiodynamic routine utilized to form OH/O surface species. The topography resulting from a mild oxidative disruption is dominated by quasi- 2 D holes and hillocks {{of the order of}} 5 nm, involving about 500 – 600 gold atoms each, and their coalescence. A cooperative turnover process at the O-layer, in which the anion ad-layer and interfacial water play a key role, determines the oxidized surface topography. The reduction of these O-layers results in gold clusters, their features depending on the applied potential routine. A moderate oxidative disruption produces a surface topography of hillocks and holes several gold atoms high and deep, respectively. The subsequent reduction leads to a spinodal gold pattern. Concurrent coalescence appears {{to be the result of}} an Ostwald ripening that involves the surface diffusion of both gold atoms and clusters. These processes produce an increase in surface roughness and an incipient <b>gold</b> <b>faceting.</b> The dynamics of different topographies can be qualitatively explained employing the arguments from colloidal science theory.

These structures are fabricated {{by a combination}} of self-assembly and microcontact printing techniques, and are characterized by electron microscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Selective binding of the S-BPP molecules to the gold nanoparticles through Au–S bonds is found, with no evidence for the formation of N–Au bonds between the pyridine or pyrazole groups of BPP and the gold surface. Subtle, but significant shifts with temperature of specific Raman S-BPP modes are also observed. We attribute these to dynamic changes in the orientation and/or increased mobility of the molecules on the <b>gold</b> nanoparticle <b>facets.</b> As for their conductance, the temperature-dependence for S-BPP networks differs significantly from standard alkanethiol-capped networks, especially above 220 K.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this dissertation is a composite of experiments {{in the growth of}} gold nanoparticles with specific optical properties of interest. The goal is to synthesize these gold nanoparticles using soybean extract for not only shape control, but for propensity as a biocompatible delivery system. The optical properties of these nanoparticles has found great application in coloring glass during the Roman empire and, over the centuries, has grown into its own research field in applications of nanoparticulate materials. Many of the current functions include use in biological systems as biosensors and therapeutic applications, thus making biocompatibility a necessity. Current use of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide leads to rod-shaped gold nanoparticles, however, the stability of these gold nanoparticles does not endure for extended periods of time in aqueous media. In my research, two important components were found to be necessary for stable, anisotropic growth of gold nanoparticles. In the first experiments, it was found that bromide {{played a key role in}} shape control. Bromide exchange on the gold atoms led to specific packing of the growing crystals, allowing for two-dimensional growth of gold nanoparticles. It was also discerned that soybean lecithin contained ligands that blocked specific <b>gold</b> <b>facets</b> leading to prismatic gold nanoparticle growth. These gold nanoprisms give a near infrared plasmon absorption similar to that of rod-shaped gold nanoparticles. These gold nanoprisms are discovered to be extremely stable in aqueous media and remain soluble for extended periods of time, far longer than that of gold nanoparticles grown using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Since soy lecithin has a plethora of compounds present, it became necessary to discover which compound was responsible for the shape control of the gold nanoprisms in order to optimize the synthesis and allow for a maximum yield of the gold nanoprisms. Many of these components were identified by high performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. However, re-spike of these components into growth solutions did not enhance the growth of gold nanoprisms. Upon separating the shapes of the gold nanoparticles using gel electrophoresis, addition of KCN to the separated gold nanoparticles allowed us to extract the culpable ligands for shape control. Analysis of these ligands by mass spectrometry elucidated the identity of PA and upon re-spike of the PA into a growth solution of PC 95, the growth of a near-infrared plasmon absorption was seen. The stability of these gold nanoparticles was tested with and without the addition of decane thiol and it was concluded that addition of the thiol allowed for improved stability of the gold nanoparticles towards cyanide. It was determined that at a concentration of 2 μM decanethiol, spherical gold nanoparticles remained stable to cyanide at the expense of the prismatic gold nanoparticles. However, at 5 μM decanethiol, both spherical and prismatic gold nanoparticles retained stability to cyanide in aqueous conditions...|$|R

We have used fully atomistic classical molecular dynamics simulations to obtain a quantitative estimate of this surface interaction using umbrella sampling (US) at various temperatures.

We observe a spontaneous adsorption of the protonated as well as nonprotonated PAMAM dendrimer on the AuNP surface. The adsorbed dendrimer on the nanoparticle surface strongly alters the interaction between the nanoparticles.

30|$|A {{method for}} growing in situ organic nanoflakes or nanofibers on a {{transistor}} platform was demonstrated in this work. The {{results show that}} the morphology of the nanostructures is strongly influenced by the drain and source electrodes width. When the gold electrodes are narrow, the p- 6 P molecules form high and narrow flake-like structures. This could be explained by topographical boundaries for p- 6 P diffusion on these substrates, which leads to more vertical aggregation. On wider gold electrodes, the larger surface diffusion areas lead to nanofiber growth, similar to growth on plane <b>gold</b> surfaces [21] (<b>faceted</b> morphology). The nanofibers start to conduct electrical current at lower VDS than the nanoflakes. The proposed explanation for this behavior is that the p- 6 P nanofibers have a bigger contact area with the electrodes, which reduces the contact resistance. Both kinds of structures present typical electrical characteristics of an organic semiconductor connected to a metal electrode in which a current starts to flow after application of a certain voltage.|$|R

40|$|Adsorption of Au on vicinal Si(001) {{results in}} {{faceting}} {{of the whole}} surface in the temperature regime between 700 C and 900 C. The initially regular double stepped surface decomposes into a ''hill and valley'' structure with (001) terraces and facets. Terrace widths from several nm to some #mu#m perpendicular to the step edges could be observed. In contrast the terraces extend up to several mm along the step edges. The transformation proceeds in several steps. Initially Au adsorbs on the surface as a lattice gas. After a critical coverage of roughly 1 / 3 monolayer is reached the lattice gas condensates and (001) terraces are formed which exhibit a complex (5 x 3 : 2) reconstruction. This reconstruction was shown to be the driving force for the faceting process and structural models are discussed using SPA-LEED and STM measurements. After nucleation terraces extend preferentially along the step edges with a speed of up to 100 #mu#m/s. Au necessary for this enlargement is collected from the lattice gas of the surrounding (XPEEM). Perpendicular to the step edges the evolution is much slower: steps of the initial surface are bunched into step bands to conservate the macroscopic miscut of the sample. A phase separation between Au rich terraces and low covered step bands is formed. This continues until the step bands reach an inclination angle of 15. With further deposition Au necessarily adsorbs on the step bands rearranging them to <b>gold</b> rich <b>facets.</b> Facet orientations like (113), (115) and (117) could be observed during deposition below 850 C, while above this temperature solely (119) facets are formed.

Chapter 2 discusses the post synthetic, solution based end to end assembly of CdS, CdTe and Ag 2 S nanorods via the addition of octylamine. This spontaneous room temperature reaction led to the ttachment of nanorods, which were a controlled multiple of the starting length, up to a maximum final length of 160 nm. Chapter 3 discusses rapid gold tip formation on CdS, CdSe and CdTe nanorods via a precursor modification to an established solution based technique. Controllable gold tip sizes from 1 to 40 nm were achieved on CdSe nanorods while tip sizes up to 15 nm were achievable onto CdS and CdTe nanorods.
