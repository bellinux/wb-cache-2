5|$|Homer ignores {{his studies}} and instead focuses on his preconceived notions of college life through {{adolescent}} movies and TV shows, {{such as the}} fictional The School of Hard <b>Knockers,</b> which stereotype college life as pranks, partying and rigid deans. He also insults the college dean, Dean Peterson, believing {{him to be a}} crusty, conservative administrator. In reality, Peterson relates well with the students and is relatively young. Homer acts like a know-it-all in class and is asked to demonstrate how a proton accelerator operates; consequently, he causes a nuclear meltdown in class. Dean Peterson takes him aside and recommends hiring a tutor. The tutors turn out to be three computer nerds named Benjamin, Doug, and Gary. The trio try to help Homer understand the material from his physics course, but he refuses to cooperate. Instead, he is determined to help them gain a social life by pulling a prank on rival college Springfield A University. The prank involves kidnapping the other school's mascot, a pig named Sir Oinks-a-lot. However, Homer causes the pig to become very ill after feeding it malt liquor, and Benjamin, Doug, and Gary are blamed for the incident.|$|E

60|$|But {{then it was}} SUCH a <b>knocker.</b> A wild, extravagant, {{and utterly}} incomprehensible <b>knocker.</b> A <b>knocker</b> so mysterious and {{suspicious}} that Policeman X 37, first coming upon it, felt inclined to take it instantly in custody, but compromised with his professional instincts by sharply and sternly noting it with an eye that admitted of no nonsense, but confidently expected to detect its secret yet. An ugly knocker; a <b>knocker</b> with a hard, human face, that was a type of the harder human face within. A human face that held between its teeth a brazen rod. So hereafter, in the mysterious future should be held, etc., etc.|$|R

500|$|When {{finished}} in 1743 the Exchange, as planned, had [...] "the outward appearance of one grand structure,” and the much-admired exterior remains today largely as built. The {{front of the}} building has Corinthian columns in the centre and pilasters to the sides. A central semicircular-arched doorway has cast-iron lion-head <b>knockers.</b> A frieze with human and animal heads symbolises trade, and a Royal Coat of Arms is displayed in the tympanum. The rear of the building is symmetrical with pedimented windows and semicircular ground-floor arches.|$|E
500|$|In the tin mines of Devon and Cornwall, pasties were {{associated}} with [...] "knockers", spirits said to create a knocking sound that was either supposed to indicate the location of rich veins of ore, or to warn of an impending tunnel collapse. To encourage the good will of the <b>knockers,</b> miners would leave {{a small part of}} the pasty within the mine for them to eat. Sailors and fisherman would likewise discard a crust to appease the spirits of dead mariners, though fishermen believed that it was bad luck to take a pasty aboard ship.|$|E
500|$|The {{shows at}} the club were choreographed by Larry Steele for many years, {{along with those of}} the nearby Paradise Club, and often {{featured}} [...] "comedians dressed like clowns, plantation hands, and frumpy old ladies [...] dirty jokes to start things off". A full chorus line called the Sepia Revue featured 12 showgirls dressed in [...] "black high heels, skimpy, sequined dresses, long boas and feathered headgear" [...] dancing with more and more abandon as the [...] "red hot" [...] house band backed them up. Another chorus line called Beige Beauties also performed artistic dance numbers. There was no applause at the club. Guests found long wooden sticks with wooden balls at the end called [...] "table knockers" [...] at their tables. [...] Patrons were to hit the table with their <b>knockers</b> to indicate their appreciation of performances.|$|E

500|$|There {{are only}} a handful of {{existing}} ceramic models of multi-story towers from pre-Han and Western Han eras; the bulk of the hundreds of towers found so far were made during the Eastern Han period. Model towers could be fired as one piece in the kiln or assembled from several different ceramic pieces to create the whole. No one tower is a duplicate of the other, yet they share common features. They often had a walled courtyard at the bottom, a balcony with balustrades and windows for every floor, roof tiles capping and concealing the ceiling rafters, human figures peering out the windows or standing on the balconies, door <b>knockers,</b> and pets such as dogs in the bottom courtyard. Perhaps the most direct pieces of evidence to suggest that miniature ceramic tower models are faithful representations of real-life Han timber towers are tile patterns. Artistic patterns found on the circular tiles that cap the eave-ends on the miniature models are exact matches of patterns found on real-life Han roof tiles excavated at sites such as the royal palaces in Chang'an and Luoyang, and even the tiles of the original White Horse Temple. The ceramic model towers featured below come from tombs of the Han dynasty: ...|$|E
500|$|Barker's {{material}} {{included the}} sketch {{which came to}} be known as [...] "Four Candles", airing in 1976, although in the original script it was entitled [...] "Annie Finkhouse". It sees a customer (Barker) ask for a series of things in a hardware store. The sketch's humour derives from similarities in word pronunciation, leading to confusion on the part of the store owner (Corbett). These misunderstandings include the confusion between [...] "four candles" [...] and [...] "fork handles". The idea for the sketch came from the owners of a hardware shop in Hayes, Hillingdon who wrote in to The Two Ronnies to describe some of the amusing events and misunderstandings in their store. Barker was never happy with the sketch's final line (a male assistant asking [...] "What sort of billhooks did you want?") and changed it (to a female assistant asking [...] "What sort of <b>knockers</b> were you looking for?") for the stage version of The Two Ronnies, although he was still not totally satisfied with it. Nevertheless, the sketch is considered the show's most famous one and was voted as the show's best in a TV special, while also placing fifth on Channel 4's 50 Greatest Comedy Sketches. The original script, hand-written by Barker, was sold for £48,500 at auction in 2007 after being featured on an episode of Antiques Roadshow the previous year.|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2009 {{interview}} with VIP magazine, Ahern spoke of how critics who blame the Government {{for the economic}} crisis should [...] "dig the garden or grow bluebells or do something useful". He continued, saying that the Irish property bubble was not the fault of his Government and that [...] "cynics and <b>knockers,</b> people who always see the glass as half empty. I can’t understand people who are always bitching, saying ‘It's the Government's fault, it's the doctor's fault, it's the cat's fault.’ It's everybody's fault except their own.".|$|E

2500|$|Multiple {{items of}} ecclesiastical nature {{were found in}} the structure. These include {{fragments}} of marble chancel screens, an altar table and a Second-Temple era stone ossuary in use as a reliquary and containing a skull. Crosses were ubiquitous, including on roof tiles, oil lamps, door <b>knockers,</b> and several bronze crosses, one of which was [...] in length. Several fragments of a chancel screen depict two deer, Christian symbols of faith and devotion mentioned in , facing a cross planted on the Hill of Golgotha. A stone lintel was found depicting a cross enclosed within a wreath.|$|E

6000|$|... "This {{house had}} a PIN or RISP at the door, {{instead of the}} more modern convenience--a knocker. The pin, {{rendered}} interesting by the figure which it makes in Scottish song, was formed of a small rod of iron, twisted or notched, which was placed perpendicularly, starting out a little from the door, and bore a small ring of the same metal, which an applicant for admittance drew rapidly {{up and down the}} NICKS, so as to produce a grating sound. Sometimes the rod was simply stretched across the VIZZYING hole, a convenient aperture through which the porter could take cognisance of the person applying; in which case it acted also as a stanchion. These were almost all disused about sixty years ago, when <b>knockers</b> were generally substituted as more genteel. But <b>knockers</b> at that time did not long remain in repute, though they have never been altogether superseded, even by bells, in the Old Town. The comparative merit of <b>knockers</b> and pins was for a long time a subject of doubt, and many <b>knockers</b> got their heads twisted off {{in the course of the}} dispute."--CHAMBERS'S TRADITIONS OF EDINBURGH.|$|E
