25|$|In the Septuagint, the Greek {{version of}} the Hebrew scriptures, the word Abyssos is treated as a noun of <b>feminine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> even though Greek nouns ending in -os are {{typically}} masculine. Abyssos is equivalent in meaning to Mesopotamian Abzu as the dark chaotic sea before Creation. The word also appears in the Christian scriptures, occurring six times in the Book of Revelation, where it is conventionally translated not as “the deep” but as “the bottomless pit” of Hell. Barb argues that in essence the Sumerian Abzu is the “grandmother” of the Christian Devil.|$|E
25|$|Under the Roman Empire, {{the city}} was known by its Greek name Τιβεριάς (Tiberiás, Modern Greek Τιβεριάδα Tiveriáda), an {{adaptation}} of the taw-suffixed Semitic form that preserved its <b>feminine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> In 61 CE Herod Agrippa II annexed the city to his kingdom whose capital was Caesarea Philippi. During the First Jewish–Roman War {{took control of the}} city and destroyed Herod's palace, but was able to stop the city from being pillaged by the army of the Jewish ruler who had remained loyal to Rome. While most other cities in the provinces of Judaea, Galilee and Idumea were razed, Tiberias was spared because its inhabitants remained loyal to Rome, after Josephus had surrendered the city to the future Roman emperor Vespasian. It became a mixed city after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE; with Judea subdued, the surviving southern Jewish population migrated to the Galilee.|$|E
50|$|Nouns {{have three}} <b>grammatical</b> <b>genders</b> ({{masculine}}, <b>feminine</b> and neuter) that correspond, {{to a certain}} extent, with the word ending so most nouns with -a are feminine, -o and -e neuter, and the rest mostly masculine but with some <b>feminine.</b> The <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of a noun affects the morphology of other parts of speech (adjectives, pronouns, and verbs) attached to it. Nouns are declined into seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental.|$|R
5000|$|In some languages, genders are {{assigned}} to nouns, such as masculine, feminine and neuter (or other combinations). The gender of a noun (as well as its number and case, where applicable) will often entail agreement in words that modify or are related to it. For example, in French, the singular form of the definite article is le with masculine nouns and la with feminines; adjectives and certain verb forms also change (with the addition of -e with <b>feminines).</b> <b>Grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> often correlates with {{the form of the}} noun and the inflection pattern it follows; for example, in both Italian and Russian most nouns ending -a are feminine. Gender can also correlate with the sex of the noun's referent, particularly in the case of nouns denoting people (and sometimes animals). Nouns arguably do not have gender in Modern English, although many of them denote people or animals of a specific sex, and pronouns that refer to nouns must take the appropriate gender for that noun. (The girl lost her spectacles.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Because of the {{similarities}} in morphology of <b>feminine</b> and masculine <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> inflections in Indo-European languages, {{there is a}} theory that in an early stage, the Proto-Indo-European language had only two grammatical genders: [...] "animate" [...] and [...] "inanimate/neuter". The distinction was preserved in Anatolian languages like Hittite, {{all of which are}} now extinct.|$|R
2500|$|The French and English-adopted terms [...] née and né ( [...] ; [...] , [...] ) {{are used}} to {{indicate}} the name at birth. [...] The term née, having <b>feminine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> {{can be applied to}} a woman's surname at birth that has been replaced or changed, most often (in English-speaking cultures) at marriage. The masculine form né, though uncommon, can likewise be applied in English or French to men's family names changed for any reason. The accent marks are significant to the spelling but sometimes omitted.|$|E

5000|$|... "Blond", {{with its}} {{continued}} gender-varied usage, {{is one of}} few adjectives in written English to retain separate masculine and <b>feminine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>genders.</b> Each of the two forms, however, is pronounced identically. American Heritage's Book of English Usage propounds that, insofar as [...] "a blonde" [...] {{can be used to}} describe a woman but not a man who is merely said to possess blond(e) hair, the term {{is an example of a}} [...] "sexist stereotype whereby women are primarily defined by their physical characteristics." [...] The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) records that the phrase [...] "big blond beast" [...] was used in the 20th century to refer specifically to men [...] "of the Nordic type" [...] (that is to say, blond-haired). The OED also records that blond as an adjective is especially used with reference to women, in which case it is likely to be spelt [...] "blonde", citing three Victorian usages of the term. The masculine version is used in the plural, in [...] "blonds of the European race", in a citation from 1833 Penny cyclopedia, which distinguishes genuine blondness as a Caucasian feature distinct from albinism.|$|R
50|$|Classical Latin {{typically}} made a <b>grammatical</b> <b>feminine</b> <b>gender</b> in “a” (silva - forest, aqua - water) {{and this}} was reflected in feminine names originating in that period, like Emilia. Romance languages preserved this characteristic. For example Spanish has approximately 89% feminine nouns with an “a” ending and 98% given names with the same ending.|$|R
5000|$|Every French noun has a <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> either {{masculine}} or <b>feminine.</b> The <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of a noun {{referring to}} a human usually corresponds to the noun's natural gender (i.e., its referent's sex or gender). For such nouns, there will very often be one noun of each gender, with the choice of noun being determined by the natural gender of the person described; for example, a male singer is a chanteur, while a female singer is a chanteuse. A plural noun that refers to {{both males and females}} is masculine. In some cases, the two nouns are identical in form, with the difference only being marked in neighbouring words (due to gender agreement; see below); a Catholic man is un catholique, while a Catholic woman is une catholique. Nonetheless, there are some such nouns that retain their <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> regardless of natural gender; personne 'person' is always feminine, while (at least in [...] "standard" [...] French) professeur 'teacher' is always masculine. In Canadian French, une professeure is the standard feminine form, which {{is becoming more and more}} common in European French.|$|R
50|$|The Latin word Vitis has <b>feminine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> and {{therefore}} species names with adjectival specific epithets take feminine forms, such as V. vinifera.|$|E

40|$|Language {{interacts with}} {{olfaction}} in exceptional ways. Olfaction {{is believed to}} be weakly linked with language, as demonstrated by our poor odor naming ability, yet olfaction seems to be particularly susceptible to linguistic descriptions. We tested the boundaries of the influence of language on olfaction by focusing on a non-lexical aspect of language (<b>grammatical</b> <b>gender).</b> We manipulated the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of fragrance descriptions to test whether the congruence with fragrance gender would affect the way fragrances were perceived and remembered. Native French and German speakers read descriptions of fragrances containing ingredients with <b>feminine</b> or masculine <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> and then smelled masculine or feminine fragrances and rated them on a number of dimensions (e. g., pleasantness). Participants then completed an odor recognition test. Fragrances were remembered better when presented with descriptions whose <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> matched the gender of the fragrance. Overall, results suggest grammatical manipulations of odor descriptions can affect odor cognitio...|$|R
2500|$|Colloquially, surname {{variants}} {{for women}} continue {{to appear in}} some German dialects. In Bavarian dialect surnames of women sometimes are formed by adding the ending [...] "-in", used in standard High German to indicate noun variants for women or items of <b>grammatical</b> <b>feminine</b> <b>gender,</b> such as Näherin (seamstress), with Näher (seamster) being the male form. In West Low German parlance the ending [...] "…sch(e)" [...] is sometimes added to surnames of women, related to the standard High German adjective ending [...] "…isch" [...] (cognitive to English [...] ""), suffixed to nouns or adjectives indicating belonging / pertaining to, being of the kind described by the suffixed word: for example, de Smidtsche, is Ms Schmidt (Smith), but literally about the Smithian (the woman pertaining to a man/family named Schmidt).|$|R
5000|$|The {{status of}} the poem as a lament spoken by a female protagonist is {{therefore}} fairly well established in criticism. Interpretations that attempt a treatment diverging from this, though diverse in their approach, bear a fairly heavy burden of proof. Thematic consistencies between the Wife's Lament and its close relative in the genre of the woman's song, as well as close neighbour in the Exeter Book, Wulf and Eadwacer, make unconventional treatments somewhat counterintuitive. A final point of divergence, however, between the conventional interpretation and variants proceeds from the similarity of the poem in some respects to elegiac poems in the Old English corpus that feature male protagonists. Similarities between the language and circumstances of the male protagonist of The Wanderer, for example, and the protagonist of the Wife's Lament have led other critics to argue, even more radically, that the protagonist of the poem (to which the attribution of the title [...] "the wife's lament" [...] is wholly apocryphal and fairly recent) {{may in fact be}} male. This interpretation, however, faces the almost insurmountable problem that adjectives and personal nouns occurring within the poem (geomorre, minre, sylfre) are <b>feminine</b> in <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> This interpretation is at the very least dependent therefore on a contention that perhaps a later Anglo-Saxon copyist has wrongly imposed feminine gender on the protagonist where this was not the original authorial intent, and such contentions almost wholly relegate discussion to the realm of the hypothetical. It is also thought by some that the Wife's Lament and the Husband's Message may be part of a larger work.|$|R

50|$|The genus {{name was}} {{established}} by Carl Linnaeus who used species epithets that are adjectives with <b>feminine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in Latin (e.g., C. trifoliata L.). This matches the pattern that names of trees ending in -us in Latin have feminine gender, although other plant names ending in -us are usually masculine.|$|E
50|$|Linnaeus {{assigned}} the Latin <b>feminine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> to the genus name Aleurites, as {{for example in}} the species name Aleurites moluccana. The current International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants has standardized all genus names ending in -ites to use the masculine gender, so the correct name of the species Aleurites moluccanus.|$|E
5000|$|In general, nouns, {{adjectives}} and determiners inflect only {{according to}} <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> (masculine or <b>feminine)</b> and <b>grammatical</b> number (singular or plural). Grammatical case is marked only on pronouns, as in English; case marking, as in English, {{is of the}} nominative-accusative type (rather than e.g. the ergative-absolutive marking of Basque or the split ergativity of Hindi). A significant exception, however, is Romanian, with two-case marking (nominative/accusative vs. genitive/dative) on nominal elements.|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that speakers of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> languages consider <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> arbitrary, but this assumption {{has never been}} tested. Research shows that the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of nouns can affect perceptions of the masculinity or femininity of the noun's referent in speakers of languages with masculine and feminine noun classes. However, bilingualism facilitates the development of lexical arbitrariness awareness, and could therefore affect awareness of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> arbitrariness. This study then compared three groups of young adult speakers of a <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> language: monolinguals, early bilinguals, and instructed second language learners. Participants evaluated the gender assignments of 25 nouns of entities (animals, abstract concepts, natural kinds, and artefacts), and answered open and closed questions about <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> Participants considered <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> as semantically motivated and mostly related gender assignments to perceived masculine or feminine connotations of referents. Knowledge of an additional <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> language was linked to increased awareness of the arbitrariness of first language gender assignments in both early bilinguals and later instructed learners. It is argued that <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> awareness deserves further investigation. Knowing more than one <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> language can increase awareness of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> arbitrariness. Implications are discussed for language teaching and language reform...|$|R
40|$|The {{selection}} of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in bare noun production is a controversial topic. In two experiments with the pictureword interference paradigm we confirmed a reliable effect of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> congruency in bare noun production in Italian and we replicated this effect in Spanish, another Romance language with a gender system {{analogous to the}} Italian one. In both Experiments, naming times were slower for pictureword pairs sharing <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> The {{results of the present}} study support the notion that <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is an intrinsic lexical property and not a pure syntactic feature selected only in noun phrase production. We assume that <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> selection is crucial in languages with a complex morphological structure, like Italian and Spanish, in which the ending vowel is itself marked for <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The terms [...] "masculine ending" [...] and [...] "feminine ending" [...] are {{not based}} on any {{cultural}} concept of [...] "masculinity" [...] or [...] "femininity". Rather, they originate from a grammatical pattern of French, in which words of <b>feminine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> typically end in a stressless syllable and words of masculine gender end in a stressed syllable.|$|E
50|$|Living beings of {{the same}} species usually are {{designed}} by two nouns: one of masculine grammatical gender for biologically male individuals, and one of <b>feminine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> for biologically female individuals. Both names, masculine and feminine, are usually only differentiated by their ending; sometimes the second is derived from the first or vice versa. Rarely, both come from different roots.|$|E
5000|$|The {{same word}} {{can refer to}} both {{masculine}} and feminine antecedents, while retaining its own, either masculine or <b>feminine,</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> For example, Classical Greek [...] hare is masculine, but can refer to male and female hares (he-hares and she-hares), and [...] fox is feminine, but can refer to male and female foxes (he-foxes and she-foxes). [...] For this meaning the term [...] "common" [...] is different from [...] "epicene".|$|E
40|$|In <b>Grammatical</b> <b>Gender</b> in Interaction: Cultural and Cognitive Aspects Angeliki Alvanoudi {{explores the}} {{relation}} between <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in person reference, culture and cognition in Modern Greek conversation. The author investigates the cultural and cognitive aspects of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> by drawing on feminist sociolinguistic and non-linguistic approaches, cognitive linguistics, research on linguistic relativity, studies on person reference in interaction and conversation analysis.

50|$|The chronicle {{from the}} {{original}} copied text through the continuations shows {{the history of the}} loss of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in West Saxon English, going from the copied portion which while mostly conforming to Old English <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> does have some discrepancies, through the first continuation in which modifiers are re-adapted to other functions and there is a large discrepancy with Old English <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> to the second continuation in which <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is completely lost or nearly so.|$|R
40|$|The <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> {{of a word}} is a lexical-syntactic {{property}} determining {{agreement among}} different sentence parts. Recent fMRI investigations identified the areas involved in the retrieval of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> near the left Broca´s area providing further evidence to confirm the preeminent syntactic role of this area. However, these studies employed categorical designs based on the controversial methodology of the cognitive subtraction of neural activations related to different tasks. In the present study we identified the neural substrates of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> assignment using an fMRI parametric study. Participants decided the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of visually presented Italian words whose gender-to-ending regularity varied. The results showed activation in left and right fronto-temporal areas suggesting an interplay of both hemispheres in the processing of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender...</b>|$|R

A rebuttal by Kølle was printed in both publications in 1797. He was a predecessor of later language reformers, including Rasmus Rask and Knud Knudsen. The letter å eventually became introduced in Norwegian in 1917, and written <b>feminine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> also became a reality.|$|E
5000|$|The genus was {{established}} by Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768. It was named after Hylas in Greek mythology, the companion of Hercules. The name is unusual in that - though Laurenti knew that Hylas was male - the name is unambiguously treated in the <b>feminine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> for reasons unknown. The etymology of the name is also often incorrectly given as being derived from the Greek word [...] ( [...] , [...] "forest" [...] or [...] "wood").|$|E

40|$|<b>Grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in French {{language}} {{is one of}} the biggest guessing games for a native English speaker. Why a table is feminine and a book is masculine is a question that plagues those learning French as a second language. In French, all nouns have gender, masculine and feminine. The complication: only a small percentage of the nouns are assigned gender semantically leaving the remaining which are assigned gender seemingly arbitrarily. For English native speakers, the distinction of these basic parts in a foreign {{language is}} not a natural skill. The simple fact that nouns are either feminine or masculine is troubling to students of the French language. This struggle of the English native speaker with French <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> presents a valuable opportunity to study how <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is acquired. This project is a study of French <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> acquisition of English native speakers. First, it examines the existing methods by which <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is acquired. The research then contrasts the acquisition of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in second language learning to the acquisition for native French speakers. This paper then factors in the different variables that affect how <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is learned as a second language. These variables include age, level of French, motivation, type and amount of explicit review, and positive and negative feedback. I created a survey of students from high school French levels 2, 3, 4, and 5 asking them to identify the gender of a series of French nouns, some of which can be determined by gender by general rules, some exceptions, and nouns that are typically used within various contexts. This project summarizes the results as well as compares them to the students’ responses to the following: How did you learn to decide between masculine and feminine nouns? How do you feel about how well you can distinguish M/F? and What do you know about masculine and feminine nouns in French? This research summarizes the pedagogy surrounding <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> and its effectiveness. Processing this study thus acts as a chance to improve personal acuity with <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> Furthermore, it provides a guide for how to communicate <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in French to students. Along with the research, I provide general curricula of how to communicate <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in the French foreign language classroom. This is accompanied by complete lesson plans highlighting <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> as either a focus completely on masculine vs feminine nouns, a review or frontloading activity. This paper and curricula represent the attempt to understand the many facets in the acquisition of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in order to apply a knowledgeable approach to the instruction of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in French...|$|R

Moreover, I argue that this social dimension of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is related to covert assumptions shared by participants about referents as women or men. I explore empirically the relation between <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> and culture by employing conversation analysis, in addition to the notion of the gender membership category...|$|R
40|$|This work, <b>Grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> - a Czech-Hungarian {{experimental}} comparison {{deals with}} {{the existence of the}} <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in language and its influence on the conceptualization of the inanimate objects of its speakers. Its goal is, through carrying out an experiment on Czech language (that means on a language with <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender)</b> and on Hungarian language (that means on a language without <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender)</b> to verify the assumption, that the Czech native speakers would focus on the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> while responding, unlike the Hungarian native speakers, whose language does not have <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> For this purpose, two methods are used. In one of them the respondents have to assign a voice to given inanimate objects (either male or female) or as the case may be, they have to assign a first name. The data was collected through an online questionary. The results of the research verified the previous assumption, that means the influence of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> on the responses of the Czech native speakers.
