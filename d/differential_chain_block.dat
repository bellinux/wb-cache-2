40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into three parts. In the first part, we give an {{introduction}} to J. Harrison's theory of <b>differential</b> <b>chains.</b> In the second part, we apply these tools to generalize the Cauchy theorems in complex analysis. Instead of requiring a piecewise smooth path over which to integrate, we can now do so over non- rectifiable curves and divergence-free vector fields supported away from the singularities of the holomorphic function in question. In the third part, we focus on applications to dynamics, in particular, flows on compact Riemannian manifolds. We prove that the asymptotic cycles are <b>differential</b> <b>chains,</b> and that for an ergodic measure, they are equal as <b>differential</b> <b>chains</b> to the <b>differential</b> <b>chain</b> associated to the vector field and the ergodic measure. The first part is expository, but the second and third parts contain new results...|$|R
50|$|As a {{graduate}} student at the University of Warwick, where Zeeman introduced her to Plateau's problem. She found a counterexample to the Seifert conjecture at Oxford. In a Berkeley seminar in 1983 she proposed the existence of a general theory linking these together, and the theory of <b>differential</b> <b>chains</b> began to evolve. Jenny Harrison and Harrison Pugh proved that the topological vector space of <b>differential</b> <b>chains</b> satisfies a universal property determined by two natural axioms. They have used the theory to provide the first universal solution to Plateau's problem, including soap film regularity, building upon Harrison's earlier paper. Recently, Fried and Seguin have found a broad generalization to Reynolds transport theorem using the methods of <b>differential</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|R

We show that 'B(U) is not generally reflexive, identifying a fundamental difference between currents and <b>differential</b> <b>chains.</b> We also give several new brief (though non-constructive) definitions of the space 'B(U), and prove {{that it is a}} separable ultrabornological (DF) -space. <b>Differential</b> <b>chains</b> are closed under dual versions of fundamental operators of the Cartan calculus on differential forms. The space has good properties some of which are not exhibited by currents B'(U) or D'(U).

40|$|Abstract. <b>Differential</b> {{addition}} <b>chains</b> (also {{known as}} strong addition chains, Lucas chains, and Chebyshev chains) are addition chains {{in which every}} sum is already accompanied by a difference. Low-cost <b>differential</b> addition <b>chains</b> are used to efficiently exponentiate in groups where the operation a, b, a/b ↦ → ab is fast: in particular, to perform x-coordinate scalar multiplication P ↦ → mP on an elliptic curve y 2 = x 3 + Ax 2 + x. Similarly, low-cost two-dimensional <b>differential</b> addition <b>chains</b> are used to efficiently compute the function P, Q, P −Q ↦ → mP +nQ on an elliptic curve. This paper presents two new constructive upper bounds on the costs of two-dimensional <b>differential</b> addition <b>chains.</b> The paper’s new “binary ” chain {{is very easy to}} compute and uses 3 additions (14 field multiplications in the elliptic-curve context) per exponent bit, with a uniform structure that helps protect against side-channel attacks. The paper’s new “extended-gcd ” chain takes more time to compute, does not have the uniform structure, and is not easy to analyze, but experiments show that it takes only about 1. 77 additions (9. 97 field multiplications) per exponent bit. 1 What is a <b>differential</b> addition <b>chain?</b> A <b>differential</b> addition <b>chain</b> is an addition chain in which each sum is already accompanied by a difference: i. e., whenever a new chain element P +Q is formed by adding P and Q, the difference P − Q was already in the chain.

5000|$|Harrison {{specializes in}} {{geometric}} analysis and {{areas in the}} intersection of algebra, geometry, and geometric measure theory. She introduced and developed with collaborators a theory of generalized functions called <b>differential</b> <b>chains</b> that unifies an infinitesimal calculus with the classical theory of the smooth continuum, a long outstanding problem. The infinitesimals are constructive and arise from methods of standard analysis, {{as opposed to the}} nonstandard analysis of Abraham Robinson. The methods apply equally well to domains such as soap films, fractals, charged particles, and Whitney stratified spaces, placing them on the same footing as smooth submanifolds in the resulting calculus. The results include optimal generalizations and simplifications of the theorems of Stokes, Gauss and Green. She has pioneered applications of <b>differential</b> <b>chains</b> to the calculus of variations, physics, and continuum mechanics. Her solution to Plateau's problem is the first proof of existence of a solution to a universal Plateau’s problem for finitely many boundary curves, taking into account all soap films arising in nature, including nonorientable films with triple junctions, as well as solutions of Jesse Douglas, [...] Herbert Federer and Wendell Fleming. Recently, she and Harrison Pugh have announced existence and soap film regularity of a solution to a universal Plateau's problem for codimension one surfaces using Hausdorff measure to define area.|$|R
