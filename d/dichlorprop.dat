40|$|Abstract. Potential {{exposure}} to pesticide residues resulting from burning wood treated with phenoxy and pyridine herbicides was assessed. Wood samples from trees treated with 2, 4 -D [2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy acetic acid], dicamba [3, 6 -dichloro-oanisic acid], <b>dichlorprop</b> [2 -(2, 4 -dichlorphenoxy) propionic acid], picloram [4 -amino- 3, 5,dtrichloropicolinic acid], and triclopyr (3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyri dinyl) oxy acetic acid contained variable amounts of parent compound residues at 4, 8, and 12 months after application. At {{the time of}} the latter sampling, residues of 2, 4 -D, dicamba, and picloram were ~ 2. 1 mg/kg on a fresh weight basis. Mean residue concentrations of triclopyr and <b>dichlorprop</b> were somewhat higher at 3. 5 and 13. 0 mg/kg, respectively. In a laboratory experiment, samples with known amounts of herbicide residue were subjected to either slow or rapidly burning conditions in a tube furnace. During slow combustion, relatively stable compounds such as 2, 4 -D, dicamba, and <b>dichlorprop</b> were released in significant amounts. Rapid combustion greatly enhanced decomposition of 2, 4 -D, dicamba, <b>dichlorprop,</b> picloram, and triclopyr. A well-developed fire in a wood stove or fireplace, with active flaming combustion, where temperatures commonly reach 800 - l,OOO”C, should result in greater than 95 % thermal decomposition of the herbicides examined in this study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present F and E study was to {{investigate}} the ecotoxicology of two pesticides in artificial aquatic open systems. The influence of the chemicals on the structural and functional parameters of the test systems as well as the persistency of the chemicals were recorded. In addition, it was also a goal of these investigations to solve problems in the method, including the following aspects: variations, i. e., reproducibility of the experimental results, the length of time between setting up the system and introduction of the pesticide, methods of evaluation and size of the system. In the open-microcosm-experiment, the addition of <b>dichlorprop,</b> in doses of 0. 1 mg/l and 2 mg/l, resulted in damage of the higher water plants. The damage to the water plants caused little change in the photosynthesis-dependent water chemical parameters. As a further secondary effect, there was a reduced abundance of libellen larvae in the year following pesticide application, especially in the compartments with higher levels of contamination. <b>Dichlorprop</b> proved to be relatively stable under the experimental conditions. The enrichment of <b>dichlorprop</b> in the macrophytes was minimal, and did not occur in the sediment. The addition of trifluralin, at concentrations of 0. 1 mg/l, 0. 3 mg/l, 1 mg/l and 3 mg/l, decreased the populations of phytoplankton, zooplankton and zoobenthon in the open microcosms. Investigations in the year following contamination showed that the damaged populations recovered. Approximately one year after the application, even the organism community in the compartment treated with 3 mg/l was again {{similar to that of the}} control. The active substance trifluralin disappeared relatively quickly from the water of the open microcosms, and there was only a slight enrichment of trifluralin in the sediment. In the macrophytes, however, trifluralin was enriched; this was especially strong for the snail Lymnaea stagnalis. (orig.)

The model was parameterised with site-specific degradation and sorption data to enable transport simulations. Local climatological data and a 21 -year record of agricultural pesticide use within the study area were used as boundary conditions. Model output was evaluated against a 7 -year long pesticide monitoring data-series from two monitoring wells within the study area. The model successfully predicts observed breakthrough of bentazone, <b>dichlorprop,</b> isoproturon and MCPA. However, it fails to simulate observed occurrences of glyphosate and metamitron. Glyphosate and metamitron exhibit relatively high sorption potential, and their occurrence is suggested {{to be the result of}} non-equilibrium preferential flow paths which the model cannot reproduce due the conceptualisation of the system as homogenous and isotropic. The results indicate a promising methodological approach applicable to groundwater contamination risk assessment, and demonstrate the potential for transport model calibration by means of tritium and helium- 3 data. Main constraints of the study relate to the relatively simple system conceptualisation, indicating a need for further consideration of physical and chemical heterogeneity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Initial uptake rates of cells grown on the respective substrate showed substrate saturation kinetics with apparent affinity constants (Kt) of 108, 93, and 117 μM and maximal velocities (Vmax) of 19, 10, and 21 nmol min− 1 mg of protein− 1 for (R) -dichlorprop, (S) -dichlorprop, and 2, 4 -D, respectively. Transport of (R) -dichlorprop, (S) -dichlorprop, and 2, 4 -D was completely inhibited by various uncouplers and by nigericin but was only marginally inhibited by valinomycin and by the ATPase inhibitor N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimine.

40|$|Drinking {{water quality}} reports have {{highlighted}} a persistent trend in pesticide detection in the Republic of Ireland. One {{of the main}} concerns of the drinking water industry is that consistent pesticide removal rates do not occur despite the existence of activated carbon (AC) treatment regimes in most plants. The present work examines the removal of three chlorophenoxy herbicides (MCPA, 2, 4 -D and <b>dichlorprop)</b> from aqueous solutions by AC adsorption and a novel liquid-core microcapsule perstraction system. Herbicide adsorption to three ACs used in the drinking water industry was dependant on the pH of the water. As pH increased, adsorption decreased. Herbicide adsorption to AC was further decreased when humic acid (HA) {{was added to the}} contacting system. HA uptake by AC was minimal, possibly due to the large molecular weight associated with HA. Herbicide adsorption to AC was hindered by the presence of HA in the sample solutions and by HA pre-saturated to the AC. The possible interaction between herbicides and HA was investigated by UV Visible and fluorescence spectroscopy to evaluate any potential interactions occurring during site competition. Weak spectral changes were observed and the florescence intensity was quenched by HA addition, suggesting that some form of interaction occurs. Capsular perstraction of MCPA, 2, 4 -D and <b>dichlorprop</b> by dibutyl sebacate liquid-core microcapsules (LCMs) was demonstrated. The use of LCMs results in between 9 and 18 % of the herbicides being extracted within 60 minutes of capsule addition. The quantity of LCMs added was equal to 1 g of oil core and could be increased to achieve higher levels of extraction. The results were compared to adsorption by 1 g of activated carbon (AquaSorb 2000) over the same time period of 100 minutes. Although the remediation of herbicides was more effective, AC equilibrium had not been reached after 100 minutes.

40|$|Prairie {{wetlands}} {{are affected}} by agricultural activities, in particular herbicide contamination of wetland ecosystems. The environmental fate of herbicides in wetlands is determined by their persistence and transport. Currently, {{little is known about}} the persistence of commonly used herbicides in wetland water and sediment. The objective of this dissertation was to determine the importance of wetland sediments in influencing the fate of commonly used herbicides in prairie wetlands. Sediment sorption is an important dissipation pathway for herbicides. The effects of land use on physicochemical properties of wetland sediment, and the associations between these properties and herbicide sorption characteristics for four herbicides (trifluralin, atrazine, 2, 4 -D and glyphosate), were examined for 17 wetlands. The sorption of herbicides in sediment increased in the order of 2, 4 -D < atrazine < glyphosate < trifluralin. Overall, sediments from wetlands that were recently cultivated had lower total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), electrical conductivity (EC), exchangeable cation (EXCAT), cation excheageable capacity (CEC), and sorption coefficient (Kd) values (2, 4 -D, trifluralin, and atrazine) than sediments from semi-permanent and riparian ephemeral wetlands. Although TOC content was correlated to the sorption of 2, 4 -D, trifluralin and atrazine, riparian wetland sediments despite having a lower TOC content than semi-permanent wetland sediments, had the highest herbicide sorption capacity for 2, 4 -D, trifluralin and atrazine. To further examine the link between land use and herbicide sorption by sediment, a multi-residue analytical method was developed to quantify seven sulfonylurea herbicides commonly used in crop production (thifensulfuron-methyl, tribenuron-methyl, ethametsulfuron-methyl, metsulfuron-methyl, rimsulfuron, nicosulfuron and sulfosulfuron) in sediment from 17 wetlands. Sediment was extracted with deionized water using pressurized liquid extraction and the resultant extracts were cleaned-up using Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction cartridges. Quantification and confirmation were performed using liquid chromatography interfaced with positive ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, and multiple reaction monitoring. Calibration curves were linear with correlation coefficients greater than 0. 994 and limits of quantification ranged from 1. 0 to 2. 0 µg kg- 1. Ethametsulfuron-methyl, sulfosulfuron and metsulfuron-methyl, the three most environmentally persistent of the seven sulfonylurea herbicides monitored in this study, were most frequently detected in wetland sediment. The concentrations of sulfonylurea herbicides were higher in sediments from the semi-permanent wetland, which received surface runoff from a larger catchment. To assess the relationship between herbicide dissipation and sorption to sediment, seven commonly used herbicides (glyphosate, dicamba, bromoxynil, 2, 4 -D, MCPA, mecoprop-P and <b>dichlorprop)</b> were applied to one half of an ephemeral (E) and a semi-permanent (SP) prairie wetland to mimic a direct overspray event, a worst-case scenario for wetland contamination. Water and sediment samples collected over a 77 -d study period (early June to late August) were analyzed for herbicide concentration; aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), the degradation product of glyphosate, was also monitored. Glyphosate dissipated rapidly in the water column of each wetland with DT 50 values of 3. 7 d for wetland E and 6. 9 d for wetland SP. The mass of AMPA in each wetland increased with a concomitant decrease in the mass of glyphosate, suggesting that glyphosate degradation was occurring in the water column. In addition, glyphosate was also lost from the water column via sorption to bottom sediment, as evidenced by its detection in sediment samples up to 42 -d post-treatment (39. 0 – 224. 5 µg kg- 1). The DT 50 of the other six acid herbicides ranged from 2. 3 d (bromoxynil) to 31 d (<b>dichlorprop).</b> The two chiral herbicides, mecoprop-P and <b>dichlorprop,</b> were the most persistent acid herbicides in the water column. Sorption to sediment was also an important dissipation route for these six herbicides in water, especially in wetland E. After 77 d in the semi-permanent wetland and 56 d in the ephemeral wetland, the concentrations of bromoxynil, dicamba and 2, 4 -D were below the Canadian Water Quality Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic Life. Concentrations of the more persistent herbicides (mecoprop-P and <b>dichlorprop)</b> remained at levels above the guidelines. Use of bromide ion as a conservative tracer indicated that some of the water loss from both wetlands was via infiltration. Because there was a strong correlation between the decrease in bromide ion and herbicide mass in the water column, it is possible some herbicides were lost from the water column along with the infiltrating water. Infiltration to wetland margins during this part of the growing season would have been largely driven by the riparian vegetation surrounding both wetlands. Overall, this thesis demonstrated the importance of sediment in the dissipation of currently used herbicides in wetland ecosystems. Both laboratory sorption studies and whole-wetland experiments provided insights on the sorptivity of herbicides in sediment as well as their persistence in water and sediment...|$|E

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy studies of the interaction of lipase with kaolinite provided insight into the molecular structure of the complex and offered explanation of the effects of kaolinite on enzymatic hydrolysis of 2, 4 -DPM.

40|$|Bioconcentration factors (BCF) are {{important}} parameters {{to assess the}} environmental fate of chemicals. In this report we describe the determination of BCF for Triclosan, a trichlorophenoxy phenol, for some dissociating herbicides like <b>Dichlorprop,</b> MCPA, Mecoprop, Triclopyr and Picloram {{as well as for}} selected pyrethroids like Cyfluthrin, Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin and Permethrin. It was shown that BCF and rate constants for the uptake of Triclosan are decreasing with an increasing pH of the test water. The BCF for the herbicides evaluated are all below 10, confirming data already reported for herbicides of similar structure. Thus, for these compounds there is no tendency to bioaccumulate. Furthermore, there was no correlation between BCF and n-octanol/water partition coefficients or dissociation constants. BCF of pyrethroids were between 860 and 2200. For the analysis of pyrenthroid metabolites a gas chromatographic method using daughter-ion mass spectrometry for detection was established. The detection limit of this method was 1 #mu#g/kg, but metabolites could not be detected in fish during the bioaccumulation experiments. The high toxicity of pyrethroids for fish was approved; LC 50 -values were between 1 and 5 #mu#g/l. To evaluate physiological effects in fish, produced by pyrethroids, EROD activities in preparations of trout liver were measured. No increase in activity could be detected, but there was a tendency to lower values. We think this to result from the high toxicity of pyrethroids that could have impaired this enzyme system. (orig.) Biokonzentrationsfaktoren (BCF) sind wichtige Parameter, mit Hilfe derer das Umweltverhalten von Chemikalien abgeschaetzt werden kann. Im Rahmen dieses Forschungsvorhabens wurden BCF-Werte fuer Triclosan, ein Trichlorphenoxyphenol, fuer einige dissoziierende Herbizide: <b>Dichlorprop,</b> MCPA, Mecoprop, Triclopyr und Picloram sowie fuer ausgewaehlte Pyrethroide: Cyfluthrin, Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin und Permethrin bestimmt. Es zeigte sich, dass die BCF-Werte und die Geschwindigkeitskonstanten der Aufnahme von Triclosan mit steigendem pH-Wert des Wassers abnahmen. Die BCF-Werte der untersuchten Herbizide bestaetigten die schon in vorherigen Forschungsvorhaben gefundenen Ergebnisse. Alle BCF-Werte lagen unter 10, d. h. diesen Verbindungen kann kein Bioakkumulationspotential zugeschrieben werden. Eine Korrelation zwischen den BCF-Werten und den n-Octanol/Wasser-Vertreilungskoeffizienten (P) sowie den Dissoziationskonstanten wurde nicht beobachtet. Die BCF-Werte der Pyrethroide lagen zwischen 860 und 2200. Aur Analytik von Pyrethroid-Metaboliten wurde eine gaschromatographische Methode mit Tochterionen-Massenspektrometrie zur Detektion ausgearbeitet. Bei einer Nachweisgrenze von ca. 1 #mu#g/kg konnten jedoch keine Pyrethroid-Metaboliten nachgewiesen werden. Die aus der Literatur bekannte hohe Toxizitaet von Pyrethroiden fuer Fische wurde bestaetigt. Alle LC 50 -Werte betrugen 1 - 5 #mu#g/l. Zur Untersuchung von stoffwechselphysiologischen Effekten, ausgeloest durch Pyrethroide, wurde die EROD-Aktivitaet in Forellenleber-Praeparationen in Einzelstoffversuchen gemessen. Es zeigte sich keine Erhoehung dieses Enzymsystems. Vielmehr ergaben sich tendenziell niedrigere Aktivitaeten. Wir fuehren dies auf die hohe Toxizitaet der Pyrethroide zurueck, die auch dieses Enzymsystem geschaedigt haben koennte. (orig.)

40|$|Analysis of ISCR 8 (ISPps 1) {{revealed}} {{that this group}} of insertion elements has to be subdivided into three subgroups: ISCR 8, ISCR 22, and ISCR 23. The distinction of three subgroups is supported by phylogenetic analysis of the transposase open reading frames (ORFs). Comparison of over 20 complete and partial ISCR 8 / 22 / 23 elements identified oriIS candidate sequences for all groups and a terIS candidate sequence for ISCR 8. The oriIS sequences, their distance to the transposase ORFs, and the sequence of this intervening region are group specific, further supporting the definition of two new ISCR elements. ISCR 8 / 22 / 23 have a very broad host range, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, among which are several (opportunistic) pathogens. The IS often resides on plasmids or {{in the vicinity of}} other mobile elements and is mostly associated with genes for the degradation of halo- or nitro-aromatics. However, in one case ISCR 8 was found in the neighborhood of an antibiotic resistance determinant in Klebsiella pneumoniae. ISCR 8 resembles other IS 91 family elements in mediating genetic rearrangements by homologous recombination between two copies. In Delftia acidovorans this led to the loss of the genes encoding <b>dichlorprop</b> cleavage. In conclusion, this study shows that ISCR 8 could be a fully functional and active member of the IS 91 family of insertion elements...|$|E
40|$|For {{the study}} of the {{stereoselective}} degradation of the herbicide 2 -aryloxipropionic acid <b>dichlorprop</b> (DCPP) in soil, a porous monolithic chiral column (100 μm id) was prepared by in situ copolymerization of glycidyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate in the presence of formamide and 1 -propanol as the porogen solvents. Subsequently, the epoxide groups at the surface of the monolith were reacted with (+) - 1 -(4 -aminobutyl) -(5 R, 8 S, 10 R) -terguride as the chiral selector. Optimum conditions for the herbicide resolution by CEC were found using mobile phases consisting of acetic acid/ triethylamine mixtures in ACN-methanol (9 : 1 v/v). Under these conditions fully separation of DCPP enantiomers in the presence of clofibric acid (internal standard) was achieved in about 5 min. Experiments on the incubation of rac-DCPP in soil at room temperature showed the herbicide undergone during 23 incubation days to a degradation to levels ≤ 20 % of the initial concentration, with rates for (R) -DCPP slower than (S) -DCPP. More interesting results were observed when herbicide enantiomers were individually incubated. In both the experiments, the formation of the opposite isomer {{in the presence of the}} initial one, and reversed enantiomeric interconversion in the case of (S) -DCPP was observed. (R) -DCPP was found to be the most persistent isomer after incubation. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|E

Persistent pesticide transformation products (TPs) are increasingly being detected among different environmental compartments, including groundwater and surface water. However, there is no sufficient experimental data on their toxicological potential to assess the risk associated with TPs, even if their occurrence is known. In this study, the interaction of chlorophenoxy herbicides (MCPA, mecoprop, 2, 4 -D and <b>dichlorprop)</b> and their main transformation products with calf thymus DNA by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy has been assessed. Additionally, the toxicity of the chlorophenoxy herbicides and TPs was also assessed evaluating the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity. On {{the basis of the}} results found, it seems that AChE is not the main target of chlorophenoxy herbicides and their TPs. However, the results found showed that the transformation products displayed a higher inhibitory activity when compared with the parent herbicides. The results obtained in the DNA interaction studies showed, in general, a slight effect on the stability of the double helix. However, the data found for 4 -chloro- 2 -methyl- 6 -nitrophenol suggest that this transformation product can interact with DNA through a noncovalent mode. 1...|$|E
40|$|Two racemic herbicides, {{mecoprop}} (R,S-MCPP) and <b>dichlorprop</b> (R,S-DCPP), as well {{as their}} enantiopure R-forms, were incubated in three calcareous soils at 15 °C and 80 % of their field capacity to try to elucidate their behaviour in soil and compare the dissipation rates when racemic and enantiopure compounds are used. Quantitation of pesticides is made by HPLC and the R/S ratio by GC-MS. The inactive S-enantiomer from the racemic forms persists longer than the R-forms in silt and sandy loam soils, but for shorter time in the clay loam soil. The pure R-enantiomers, both for MCPP and DCPP, after incubation in soil, are partially converted into their S-forms. In all cases, the dissipation of racemic and pure enatiomeric forms is lower in the clay loam soil than in the silt and sandy loam soils. The R-forms' peristence, in the three soils, is approximately two times lower when they are incubated alone than when they are incubated as racemic compounds. When peat is added, the persistence of these herbicides in the silt and sandy loam soils increases, while in the clay loam soil it decreases. Besides, in the clay loam soil, the enantiomeric ratio (ER) changes from its S-preferential degradation to a preferential degradation of its R-form, so an increase in the persistence of the inactive S-form occurs.

RdpA and SdpA are strictly enantiospecific, converting only the (R) or the (S) enantiomer, respectively. Homology models were generated for both enzymes {{on the basis of}} the structure of the related enzyme TauD (PDB code 1 OS 7). Docking was used to predict the orientation of the appropriate mecoprop enantiomer in each protein, and the predictions were tested by characterizing the activities of site-directed variants of the enzymes. Mutant proteins that changed at residues predicted to interact with (R) - or (S) -mecoprop exhibited significantly reduced activity, often accompanied by increased Km values, consistent with roles for these residues in substrate binding. Four of the designed SdpA variants were (slightly) active with (R) -mecoprop. The results of the kinetic investigations are consistent with the identification of key interactions in the structural models and demonstrate that enantiospecificity is coordinated by the interactions of a number of residues in RdpA and SdpA. Most significantly, residues Phe 171 in RdpA and Glu 69 in SdpA apparently act by hindering the binding of the wrong enantiomer more than the correct one, as judged by the observed decreases in Km when these side chains are replaced by Ala...|$|E
40|$|Rainwater, sampled over {{a period}} of 2 1 / 2 years in various regions of {{south-western}} Germany with different use of pesticides, was analyzed by GC and HPLC for 27 compounds and 3 metabolites. In total 10 herbicides (alachlor, atrazine, <b>dichlorprop,</b> MCPA, mecoprop, metamitron, pendimethalin, simazine, terbuthylazine and triallat), 1 insecticide (parathion), and 2 metabolites (desethylatrazine and desethylsimazine) were detected. Not detected were fungicides, most of the insecticides and the following herbicides: chloridazon, 2, 4 -D, metazachlor and trifluralin. Most of the positive results were in the range of 0. 1 #mu#g/l, and maximum concentrations were 1 - 2 #mu#g/l. The maximum deposition by precipitation was 0. 7 g/ha"* year for a single compound. The yearly deposition for the sum of all pesticides detected was between 0. 2 to 1. 6 g/ha. Wet deposition played the major role and dry deposition was of minor importance. For some pesticides there was a correlation between local use and amount of pesticide deposited by precipitation. In bioassays with duckweed (Lemna gibba), mustard (Sinapis alba), oats (Avena sativa) and Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) the effect of long-term exposure to sublethal concentrations of the pesticides was studied, and threshold levels were estimated.

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} during 1984 - 85 season at two experimental sites near Riyadh {{to evaluate the}} efficiency of some post-emergence herbicides in the control of weeds in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).

The bromoxynil-contained treatments (Brominal plus, Buctril M, Pardner and Brominal, each at 2. 5 l/ha) were effective in controlling broad-leaved weeds, improved wheat growth and yield besides being safe and selective. Bentazonldichlorprop (Basagran DP, at 1. 51 /ha) was almost similar in many aspects to those contained bromoxynil, but did not appreciably improve the wheat biological or grain yield. Dic-lofop- methyl (IlIoxane) and difenzoquat (Avenge) each at 4. 0 1 /ha, showed effective control for grasses, and insignificantly improved the wheat growth and yield. Slight symptoms of crop phytotoxicity appeared after their application, but rapidly recovered. 2, 4 -DIMCP A (U- 46 fluid Combi, at 1. 0 l/ha) showed good control of broad-leaved weeds with slight symptoms of crop phytotoxicity and did not improve the wheat growth or yield.

40|$|A new {{analytical}} procedure using a two-step sample preconcentration (solid-phase extraction (SPE) and field-amplified sample stacking) prior to separation by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography {{was developed for}} the determination of 14 pesticides such as aldicarb, carbofuran, isoproturon, chlorotoluron, metolachlor, mecoprop, <b>dichlorprop,</b> MCPA, 2, 4 -D, methoxychlor, TDE, DDT, dieldrin, and DDE in drinking water. Good recoveries of pesticides were obtained using SPE with sample pH adjusted to 2 - 3. Field-amplified sample stacking was found to give enrichment factors up to 30 -fold preconcentration of various pesticides under reversed polarity at - 2 kV for 50 s. The optimized background electrolyte (BGE) consisted of 50 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10 mM borate buffer, 15 mM β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), and 22 % acetonitrile at pH 9. 6, running was under 25 kV and detection at 202 nm. Good linearity was obtained for all pesticides with detection limits down to 0. 04 - 0. 46 ng/mL and a working range of 0. 1 - 40 ng/mL. The repeatabilities of migration time and peak area were satisfactory with relative standard deviations (RSDs) between 0. 66 and 13. 6 % and 4. 1 and 28 %, respectively.

40|$|Two novel genes, rdpA and sdpA, {{encoding}} the enantiospecific α-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenases catalyzing R,S-dichlorprop cleavage in Delftia acidovorans MC 1 were identified. Significant {{similarities to}} other known genes were not detected, but their deduced amino acid sequences {{were similar to those}} of other α-ketoglutarate dioxygenases. RdpA showed 35 % identity with TauD of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and SdpA showed 37 % identity with TfdA of Ralstonia eutropha JMP 134. The functionally important amino acid sequence motif HX(D/E) X 23 - 26 (T/S) X 114 - 183 HX 10 - 13 R/K, which is highly conserved in group II α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, was present in both dichlorprop-cleaving enzymes. Transposon mutagenesis of rdpA inactivated R-dichlorprop cleavage, indicating that it was a single-copy gene. Both rdpA and sdpA were located on the plasmid pMC 1 that also carries the lower pathway genes. Sequencing of a 25. 8 -kb fragment showed that the dioxygenase genes were separated by a 13. 6 -kb region mainly comprising a Tn 501 -like transposon. Furthermore, two copies of a sequence similar to IS 91 -like elements were identified. Hybridization studies comparing the wild-type plasmid and that of the mutant unable to cleave <b>dichlorprop</b> showed that rdpA and sdpA were deleted, whereas the lower pathway genes were unaffected, and that deletion may be caused by genetic rearrangements of the IS 91 -like elements. Two other dichlorprop-degrading bacterial strains, Rhodoferax sp. strain P 230 and Sphingobium herbicidovorans MH, were shown to carry rdpA genes of high similarity to rdpA from strain MC 1, but sdpA was not detected. This suggested that rdpA gene products are involved in the degradation of R-dichlorprop in these strains...|$|E

Solid phase extraction (SPE) was used to isolate the analytes from abiotic matrices containing large amounts of dissolved organic material. Atmospheric-pressure ionization (API) with electrospray ionization in negative mode (ESP-) in a Quadrupole Ion Trap mass spectrometer was used to perform the characterization of the herbicides of interest. ^ The application of Laser Ablation-ICP-MS methodology in the analysis of soils and sediments is reported in this study. The analytical performance of the method was evaluated on certified standards and real soil and sediment samples. Residential soils were analyzed to evaluate feasibility of using the powerful technique as a routine and rapid method to monitor potential contaminated sites. Forty eight sediments were also collected from semi pristine areas in South Florida to conduct screening of baseline levels of bioavailable elements in support of risk evaluation. The LA-ICP-MS data were used to perform a statistical evaluation of the elemental composition as a tool for environmental forensics. ^ A LA-ICP-MS protocol was also developed and optimized for the elemental analysis of a wide range of elements in polymeric filters containing atmospheric dust. A quantitative strategy based on internal and external standards allowed for a rapid determination of airborne trace elements in filters containing both contemporary African dust and local dust emissions. These distributions were used to qualitative and quantitative assess differences of composition and to establish provenance and fluxes to protected regional ecosystems such as coral reefs and national parks. ...|$|E
