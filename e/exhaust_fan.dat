25|$|The Epps 1907 Monoplane was a {{pioneering}} aircraft built and flown in 1907 by Ben T. Epps of Athens, Georgia from an original design. The aircraft consisted {{of an open}} framework suspended below a wire-braced monoplane wing. The undercarriage consisted of three bicycle wheels, one {{at the front of}} this frame, and two behind it. A buggy seat was located beneath the wing for the pilot. A 15-horsepower (11kW) two-cylinder Anzani motorcycle engine was mounted behind the seat and drove a two-bladed propeller from an <b>exhaust</b> <b>fan</b> mounted pusher-fashion behind the wing's trailing edge. A biplane elevator unit was carried on struts {{at the front of the}} aircraft, and a single rudder on struts to its rear. The airframe was made from scrap timber collected from a sawmill, with the flying surfaces covered in cotton. Only the undersurfaces of the wings were covered.|$|E

[...] The air is then drawn underneath the work surface and {{back up to the}} top of the cabinet where it passes through the HEPA filters. A column of HEPA filtered, sterile air is also blown downward, over products and processes to prevent contamination. Air is also exhausted through a HEPA filter, and depending on the Type of Class II BSC, the air is either recirculated back into the laboratory or pulled by an <b>exhaust</b> <b>fan,</b> through ductwork where it is expelled from the building.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate different minimum ventilation systems, in relation to air quality and thermal comfort using geostatistics in brooding phase. The minimum ventilation systems were: Blue House I: <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans</b> + curtain management (end of the building); Blue House II: <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans</b> + side curtain management; and Dark House: <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans</b> + flag. The climate variables evaluated were: dry bulb temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, carbon dioxide and ammonia concentration, during winter time, at 9 a. m., in 80 equidistant points in brooding area. Data were evaluated by geostatistic technique. The results indicate that Wider broiler houses (above 15. 0 m width) present the greatest ammonia and humidity concentration. Blue House II present the best results in relation to air quality. However, none of the studied broiler houses present an ideal thermal comfort...|$|R

5000|$|In {{many smaller}} buildings, 'forced' or 'mechanical' {{ventilation}} {{is not used}} to introduce ventilation air. Instead, natural ventilation, via openable windows and other openings, <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans,</b> and infiltration are used to provide ventilation air. Typically, at least one-third air change per hour is considered the minimum. ASHRAE Standard 62.2 was adopted in 2004; it clarifies the ventilation air requirements for low-rise residences. The Standard specifies that forced ventilation is required in houses with infiltration less than 0.35 ACH. [...] This is typically accomplished with heat recovery ventilation or <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans</b> running constantly or periodically.|$|R

Those are washing machines, flush toilets, air conditioners, refrigerators, ventilation <b>fan,</b> drains, <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans,</b> televisions and pumps. The sound pressure level of equipment noise indicates that <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans</b> at 75. 8 dB (A) have the highest levels, pumps have 74. 3 dB (A), ventilation fan have 65. 5 dB (A) and refrigerators are ranked the lowest one have 43 dB (A). Besides we discuss the influence degree of noise sources to residents by statistical method. The result shows flush toilets and televisions have the most annoying degrees, then <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans,</b> washing machines, window air conditioners, pumps are following in order.

50|$|Emissions from {{fossil fuel}} fired water heaters are {{expelled}} {{using a variety}} of venting technologies. Atmospheric vented systems use room air as combustion air and exhaust air. The exhaust air is expelled through the exhaust flue by buoyancy forces resulting from the combustion. Power vent models operate similarly to atmospheric vent systems, but an <b>exhaust</b> <b>fan</b> is added to aid in the expulsion of combustion gases. Direct vent systems do not use room air for combustion; instead, buoyancy forces air from the outside through the water heater combustion system and finally exhausts the combustion gases to the outside. Powered direct-vent systems include an <b>exhaust</b> <b>fan</b> to aid in the expulsion of combustion gasses.|$|E

5000|$|In the IBM {{compatible}} PC market, the computer's {{power supply}} unit (PSU) almost always uses an <b>exhaust</b> <b>fan</b> to expel warm air from the PSU. Active cooling on CPUs started {{to appear on the}} Intel 80486, and by 1997 was standard on all desktop processors. Chassis or case fans, usually one <b>exhaust</b> <b>fan</b> to expel heated air from the rear and optionally an intake fan to draw cooler air in through the front, became common {{with the arrival of the}} Pentium 4 in late 2000. A third vent fan in the side of the PC, often located over the CPU, is also common. The graphics processing unit (GPU) on most modern graphics cards also require a heatsink and one or more fans. In some cases, the northbridge chip on the motherboard has another heatsink and fan. Other components such as the hard drives and RAM may also be actively cooled, though [...] this remains relatively unusual. It is not uncommon to find five or more fans in a modern PC.|$|E
