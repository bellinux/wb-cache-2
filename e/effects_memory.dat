We show that <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> can be very pronounced deep inside the ordered phases and in regions close to first and second order phase transition boundaries.

Shape memory polymer composites (SMPCs) have further enhanced and broadened the applications of shape memory polymers. In addition to reinforcement, SMPCs can enable or enhance athermal stimuli-active <b>effects,</b> novel shape <b>memory</b> <b>effect,</b> and new functions. Many athermal stimuli-responsive effects have been achieved such as electroactive effect, magnetic-active effect, water-active effect, and photoactive effect.

To identify <b>memory</b> <b>effects,</b> we first show quasi-steady state currents form in finite, isolated Bose and Fermi Hubbard models driven by interaction imbalance and they become steady-state currents in the thermodynamic limit.

40|$|To {{be defined}} {{by a lack of}} {{something}} – homeless – creates problematic identity challenges and fundamentally ruptures a person’s sense of ontological security. Archaeology as a contemporary material and creative practice involves working back and forth between material culture (landscapes, places and things) and intangible heritage (memories, stories and experiences).

This thesis presents fieldwork conducted in the U.

Working collaboratively with archaeology students, homeless colleagues mapped and documented landscapes and undertook two archaeological excavations of homeless sites.
