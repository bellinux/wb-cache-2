Martin {{said he was in}} the best position that he had been in for several years to win the championship, and spoke of his waning interest in looking at race results. Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the Nextel Cup races, Earnhardt stated he need to secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle. Gordon had <b>driven</b> <b>well</b> at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car he drove to victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it would help him at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although he had a poor start in the chase, Kahne rectified this by finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.|$|E

As she entered she clothed her face with her sweetest smile. [...] "How is his own mother's dearest, dearest, darling duck?" [...] she said, putting out her arms and taking the boy from the nurse. The child was at this time about ten months old, and was a strong, hearty, happy infant, always laughing when he was awake and always sleeping when he did not laugh, because his little limbs were free from pain and his little stomach was not annoyed by internal troubles. He kicked, and crowed, and sputtered, when his mother took him, and put up his little fingers to clutch her hair, and was to her as a young god upon the earth. Nothing in the world had ever been created so beautiful, so joyous, so satisfactory, so divine! And they told her that this apple of her eye was to be taken away from her! No;--that must be impossible. [...] "I will take him into my own room, nurse, for a little while--you have had him all the morning," [...] she said; as though the [...] "having baby" [...] was a privilege over which there might almost be a quarrel. Then she took her boy away with her, and when she was alone with him, went through such a service in baby-worship as most mothers will understand. Divide these two! No; nobody should do that.

Montoya was 6 seconds behind in third, followed by Frentzen and Villeneuve. Panis went backwards on dry tyres, with the Renaults, Ralf Schumacher and Coulthard climbing quickly.

40|$|We study numerically the out-of-equilibrium {{dynamics}} of interfaces at finite temperatures when <b>driven</b> <b>well</b> below the zero-temperature depinning threshold.

We also study the instantaneous velocity signal in the low temperature regime and find long-range temporal correlations.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the flight mechanism of diptera. For many years it was thought that the flight mechanism incorporated a "click". In recent years, however, doubt has been cast as to whether this exists, or whether it is an artifact of experimental procedure. The aim {{of this paper is to}} contribute to this debate by presenting an investigation into the advantages or disadvantages of such a mechanism by conducting a dynamic analysis of a simplified model of such a mechanism. It is shown that, provided the mechanism is <b>driven</b> <b>well</b> below its resonance frequency and it is well-damped, i. e., it does a lot of work, then the flight mechanism with a "click" has distinct advantages over a system that does not have a "click" but is driven at its resonant frequency...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} shown, that classically chaotic kicked systems, whose unperturbed spectrum posseses one energy scale, admits a quantum anti-resonance (QAR) behavior. In this study we extend {{the conditions under which}} which this QAR occurs for the case of a two-sided kicked 1 D infinite potential well. It is then shown by a perturbative argument that this QAR effects the behavior of the equivalent <b>driven</b> <b>well,</b> i. e., the number of periods needed to leave the initial state has a sharp peak around the QAR. We give a numerical evidence that the anti resonance persists even for large values of the perturbation parameter. Comment: The first figure is available only via FAX.

40|$|Fluid motions {{are driven}} in a sphere by an applied body force. The fluid is {{electrically}} conducting and incompressible, and {{is surrounded by}} an insulator. The vorticity equation, in which inertial terms have been omitted but which includes magnetic forces, is solved {{in conjunction with the}} pre-Maxwell equations which govern the magnetic field. The model allows the magnetic field to grow to a finite limit. Some solutions are obtained when the body force is axisymmetric and drives fluid motions which are similar to those used in a previous kine-matic study. The time evolution of the magnetic field is calculated and in most cases the magnetic field is found to approach a steady state in an oscillatory fashion. There is a critical limit of forcing below which no magnetic field can be sustained. When the dynamo is <b>driven</b> <b>well</b> above this critical limit the magnetic field undergoes large oscillations which may ultimately lead to Geomagnetic-type reversal behaviour.
