50|$|A <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> {{is a tool}} used {{to measure}} gap widths. <b>Feeler</b> <b>gauges</b> are mostly used in {{engineering}} to measure the clearance between two parts.|$|R
50|$|A taper <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> is a <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> of tapered, {{as opposed}} to parallel, shape. The blade of the gauge is of a {{constant}} thickness, and {{the two types of}} gauge are used in a similar way.|$|R
50|$|A {{clearance}} gauge is a measurement instrument intended to adjust a double seamer. It replaces a filler gauge (also known as <b>feeler</b> <b>gauges</b> or gauge wires).|$|R
30|$|The {{elevation}} of slab {{was measured by}} electronic level (Leica DNA 03) and dial gauge, the horizontal and vertical deformation of mortar were measured by dial gauge, the width of gap was measured by <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge,</b> {{and the depth of}} gap was measured by steel ruler.|$|R
2500|$|However it is {{necessary}} to check periodically the maximum opening gap of the breaker(s), using a <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge,</b> since this mechanical adjustment affects the [...] "dwell" [...] time during which the coil charges, and breakers should be re-dressed or replaced when they have become pitted by electric arcing. This system was used almost universally until the late 1970s, when electronic ignition systems started to appear.|$|R
30|$|The rail can {{efficiently}} {{decrease the}} size of gap. Compared with the track slab without rail, the maximum elevation {{at the corners of}} track slab with rail measured by dial gauge decreases by 0.75  mm (46.6 %), the maximum width measured by <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> decreases by 0.45  mm (25.7 %), and the maximum depth measured by steel ruler decreases by 9.5  mm (59.4 %).|$|R
50|$|One {{important}} {{part is the}} seamer setup. This process is usually performed by an experienced technician. Amongst the parts that need setup are seamer rolls and chucks which have to be set in their exact position (using a <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> or a clearance gauge). The lifter pressure and position, roll and chuck designs, tooling wear, and bearing wear all contribute to a good double seam.|$|R

50|$|Some mass-market {{car engines}} from the 1960s {{replaced}} the rocker-end adjustment screw with a non-adjustable rocker pivoted on a central stud with a hemispherical nut. Tappet adjustment {{was made by}} moving the pivot nut up and down. Some of these designs also required the tappet clearance to be set with the engine running. As this rapidly wore out <b>feeler</b> <b>gauges,</b> long rolls of disposable feeler strip were needed instead.|$|R
5000|$|This {{long and}} widely used engine {{arrangement}} was adjusted by turning a screw {{set in the}} end of the rocker that pressed {{on the end of the}} pushrod. This adjustment was made by rotating the engine until the cam was at its lowest point, giving the widest gap, then adjusting the rocker until this gap was at the correct spacing, as measured with the use of a <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|R
50|$|Seamer {{setup is}} usually done by an {{experienced}} individual, typically using a lifter height gauge, lifter height pressure <b>gauge,</b> and <b>feeler</b> <b>gauges</b> (small {{pieces of metal}} for go/no go testing of the distances between the roll and chuck toolings). New products like the Clearance Gauge are able to let even novice users adjust seamers and optimize them, as well as locate problems with broken/damaged tooling, shank/bushing issues, seamer adjustment issues, or broken bearings.|$|R
50|$|Valve {{clearance}} {{refers to}} the small gap between a valve lifter and a valve stem that ensures that the valve completely closes. On engines with mechanical valve adjustment, excessive clearance causes noise from the valve train. A too small valve clearance can result in the valves not closing properly, {{this results in a}} loss of performance and possibly overheating of exhaust valves. Typically, the clearance must be readjusted each 20000 mi with a <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Worshipful Company of Scientific Instrument Makers is a {{community}} made up mostly of scientists and engineers. Some work in companies. Some are academics. Some work in the National Measurement Institutes. Most are involved somehow in making or using scientific instruments. This could be any kind of scientific instrument: a measuring instrument, like a <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> or an atomic clock, or an imaging instrument like a PET scanner. It might even {{be a piece of}} control engineering incorporating many instruments.|$|R
40|$|High {{fidelity}} computational {{models are}} developed {{to study the}} nonlinear structural dynamics of a plunging membrane airfoil, which is based upon previous experimental work. Two airfoil structures are investigated: a one-dimensional string and a three-dimensional <b>Feeler</b> <b>gauge.</b> Time-periodic flapping is assumed for both cases. The nonlinear equations of motion are semi-discretized in space using the finite element method, and then discretized in time using both a high dimensional harmonic balance approach and a standard finite differencing scheme. Solutions for both time-discretization methods are compared. For weak to moderately nonlinear string problems, the harmonic balance solution compares favorably with the finite difference solution, and is two to three orders of magnitude faster to compute. When the string exhibits stronger nonlinear behavior, the harmonic balance method yields results that diverge from the true solution when multiple harmonics are used. This is likely due {{to the presence of}} multiple subharmonics in the frequency response curve. The <b>Feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> problem is investigated to explore the possibility of unstable planar motion and chaotic vibrations during plunging. While the spectral contents of the response contain multiple frequencies, neither unstable planar dynamics nor chaotic vibrations were encountered within the range of parameters tested. Further investigation is needed to determine whether such a response is possible for the current model. I...|$|R

The {{automatic}} {{measuring instrument}} for the flatness error {{of the rail}} wagon is designed with carbon fiber and aluminium alloy, which makes the instrument handy with good stiffness. After the design for the main structure and arranging the position of sensing element, finite element analysis is used to guarantee that deformation of structure itself will not affect the measurement accuracy. The design of the automatic measuring instrument for the flatness error of the Rail wagon {{takes the place of}} tradional <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> measurement, raised the work efficiency and improves the measurement accuracy to 0. 1 mm...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of welding edge linearity error of the blank sheet {{is of great}} importance in tailored blank laser welding. However, because the blank sheets have characteristics of small thickness, large size, easy bending etc [...] {{so there is no}} better means for the measurement. In this case, we put forward three measuring methods: micrometer method, coordinate measuring machine method and <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> method. Analysis and experiment results have already demonstrated the effectiveness of the three methods. The details and the comparisons of these methods are discussed in this paper.

50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{method of}} mechanically calibrating a try square or similar {{is with a}} cylindrical master square sitting on a granite or cast iron surface plate that is flat. By nature of their construction a cylindrical master square cannot help but sit at a perfect 90 degree angle to the flat surface. A square to be tested can {{be presented to the}} master and <b>feeler</b> <b>gauges</b> used with a source of light behind the gap to get a reading of deviation. If done cleanly, correctly and accurately this method can find errors down to 10 µm, which is the limit of practical accuracy since thermal expansion from contact with the fingers will distort the blade by approximately that much.|$|R
30|$|In this work, {{in order}} to study the {{influence}} mechanism of rail on the gap, we selected CRTS I slab track in two different engineering conditions: track before laying rail and track after laying rail, as measuring objects. The following parameters were measured continuously over 24  h: (1) the temperature variation in {{different regions of the}} track slab by multi-channel wireless thermometers; (2) the elevation of track slab and the horizontal and vertical deformation of mortar by electronic level and dial gauge; and (3) the width and depth of the gap between track slab and mortar by <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> and steel ruler, respectively. By investigating the gap at the four corners, we analyzed the initiation of gap and offered advices and guidance for structural design and construction of CRTS I slab track.|$|R
5000|$|A {{spark plug}} gap gauge is a disc with a sloping edge, or with round wires of precise diameters, and is {{used to measure the}} gap. Use of a <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> with flat blades instead of round wires, as is used on {{distributor}} points or valve lash, will give erroneous results, due to the shape of spark plug electrodes. The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly. With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and breaker point distributors, to the extent that spark plug gauges from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars. [...] Vehicles using compressed natural gas generally require narrower gaps than vehicles using gasoline.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{interchangeable}} barrel revolvers produced {{were the}} Dan Wesson Models W8, W9, W11, and W12, all medium-frame size frame revolvers chambered in [...]38 Special or [...]357 Magnum. The W8 and W11 had either a fixed rear sight, or a rear sight adjustable only for windage, while the W9 and W12 featured a rear sight fully adjustable for both windage and elevation. The barrels and shrouds for both models were interchangeable {{and used a}} large externally mounted nut on the muzzle end to secure the barrel and shroud. The shrouds on these early models had an elongated flange (known to collectors as [...] "Pork Chop" [...] shrouds) which mated with {{the front of the}} revolver's frame. Initial barrel/shroud options were 2 1/2-inch, 4-inch, 6-inch, and 8-inches. A custom barrel nut wrench and <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> were supplied with each pistol, and barrel changes could be accomplished in two minutes or less.|$|R

40|$|Glued {{laminated}} timber (glulam) {{is known in}} timber constructions since more than 100 years. Glulam members can delaminate due to aging and excessive changes of temperature and humidity. This results in significantly reduced load bearing capability of the affected structural members. This contribution focuses on the ultrasonic point-contact inspection of gluing plane delamination as a nondestructive method. Ultrasonic measurements on a section of a 90 -year-old roofing glulam member are presented. The results are compared with manual detection and evaluation of delamination with a <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge,</b> with X-ray computed tomography analyses, and with numerical simulations. Appropriate data evaluation of the mechanized ultrasonic results allows the determination of material separation that are deeper than 20 mm in the signature of the surface wave and large-scale delamination (> 80 % of the complete bonding width) in the back-wall echo. Numerical simulations based on {{the finite-difference time-domain method}} shed light into the details of the wave propagation and support the experimental finding...|$|R

40|$|Lower Silesia {{was broken}} into {{numerous}} tectonic blocks, graben and horsts during late Alpine orogeny. These movements were {{at its peak}} in the Neogene. Througout the Quaternary till present times this activity wakened, nevertheless their existence is still felt as local earthquakes. The area of SW Poland is characterised by dense settlement and development resulting from favourable climatic and soil conditions and abundant mineral resources. Numerous engineering objects: water dams, mines, city agglomerations have been built. Some of water dams have been located in tectonic zones, whose activity was confirmed by geological studies. This creates possible threat for people living there. Within successive projects a geodetic monitoring system, based on satellite GPS, geodetic, gravimetric and relative (<b>feeler</b> <b>gauge)</b> observations, in “geodynamic profiles ” connected by means of GPS network, has been developed. Multiple measurements indicate differentiated crustal movements in the investigated area, particularly in young tectonic graben.

40|$|These {{studies are}} the {{continuation}} of previously conducted researches based on displacements of the Solina Dam. To support the monitoring of the dam, the EDF model were used. This model determines the dependence between displacements observed on {{the elements of the}} dam and the level of the upper water, cyclicality of temperatures and the impact of time. The use of model, in both the imaging of displacements of the Solina Dam and forecasts made for the benchmarks located on the crest of the dam, gave satisfactory results, therefore further analysis were undertaken. Displacement forecasting was made based on data from <b>feeler</b> <b>gauges</b> located at the pillars, retaining walls and four galleries. Analysis based on 4 different forecasting periods enabled for the conclusion that to obtain reliable forecasts, measurement data based on 10 years of operation with frequency of 1 per month is required.

40|$|Collaborative {{filtering}} (CF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular recommender system technologies, and utilizes the known preferences of a group of users to predict the unknown preference of a new user. However, the existing CF techniques has the drawback that it requires the entire existing data be maintained and analyzed repeatedly whenever new user ratings are added. To avoid such a problem, Eigentaste, a CF approach based on the principal component analysis (PCA), has been proposed. However, Eigentaste requires that each user rate every item in the so called <b>gauge</b> <b>set</b> for executing PCA, which may not be always feasible in practice. Developed in this article is an iterative PCA approach in which no <b>gauge</b> <b>set</b> is required, and singular value decomposition is employed for estimating missing ratings and dimensionality reduction. Principal component values for users in reduced dimension are used for clustering users. Then, the proposed approach is compared to Eigentaste in terms of the mean absolute error of prediction using the Jester, MovieLens, and EachMovie data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, even without a <b>gauge</b> <b>set,</b> performs slightly better than Eigentaste regardless of the data set and clustering method employed, implying that it can be used as a useful alternative when defining a <b>gauge</b> <b>set</b> is neither possible nor practical...|$|R

5000|$|The engine {{features}} four inline cylinders inclined {{at an angle}} of approximately 45 degrees (hence the name), and this is because Vauxhall had originally planned to develop a whole family of engines all built on the same production line. There was to be slant four and V8 versions in both petrol and diesel versions, designed {{under the guidance of}} Vauxhall's then chief engineer, John Alden. Although several diesel 4-cylinder and a V8 petrol engine prototypes were built only the 4-cylinder petrol made it to series production. There is a single overhead camshaft operating two valves per cylinder. An ingenious valve train design incorporating an inclined socket head cap screw, allowed valve clearances to be adjusted with a <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> and an Allen key. The block and crossflow head are both of cast iron. The layout makes good use of the cylinder inclination to lower the overall height of the engine, which allowed for more aerodynamic designs of cars to be achieved by lowering the bonnet line. It also means most of the engine is very easy to access for maintenance, {{with the exception of the}} exhaust manifold and spark plugs, which are [...] "underneath" [...] the slanted cylinders.|$|R

5000|$|When fitting new {{piston rings}} or {{breaking}} them in within an engine, {{the end gap}} is a crucial measurement. In order that a ring may be fitted into the [...] "grooves" [...] of the piston, it is not continuous but is broken at one point on its circumference. The ring gap may be checked by putting the ring into the bore/liner (squared to bore) and measuring with a <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge.</b> End gap should be within recommended limits for size of bore and intended [...] "load" [...] of engine. Metals expand with a rise in temperature, so too small a gap may result in overlapping or bending when used under hot running conditions (racing, heavy loads, towing) and, even at normal temperatures, a small ring gap may lead to ring gap closure, ring breakage, bore damage and possible seizure of the piston. Too large a gap may give unacceptable compression and levels of blow-by gases or oil consumption. When being measured in a used bore, it may indicate excessive bore wear or ring wear. (Radial wear on ring face reduces thickness of used/worn ring (face wear in bore) essentially decreasing face circumference of ring and thereby increasing size of ring end gap.) ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{surfaces}} which {{define the}} edges of the aperture are the anvils, which may be made of separate pieces of hard material such as tungsten carbide for wear resistance. Two apertures are frequently used to provide Go/No-Go testing and are often arranged such that a part being measured can pass through the two apertures in sequence; a part that is within tolerance will pass through the first maximum size limit aperture but {{will not be able to}} pass through the minimum size limit aperture. A snap gauge usually has a [...] "C" [...] shaped frame with the aperture(s) at the opening of the [...] "C". Snap gages may be machined and ground out of a single block of metal or adjustable snap gages, which have movable anvils that may be adjusted over a limited range of sizes, may be used. They may also be of built up construction in which one or more gage blocks or <b>feeler</b> <b>gauges</b> are sandwiched between two anvils. Adjustable snap gages may be reset to compensate for wear or re-tasked for measuring a different dimension and can be purchased off the shelf and set rather than needing to be fabricated from scratch when a new gage is needed. Gauge blocks would typically be used to initially set the width of the measuring aperture(s).|$|R
