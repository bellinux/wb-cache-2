5|$|After his exile, Larrea {{moved to}} Bordeaux in France, and did {{business}} {{with some of}} his old associates. He continued correspondence with Bernardino Rivadavia, and in 1818 he moved to Montevideo, under Brazilian control at that time, and strengthened his contacts in Buenos Aires from there. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>finally</b> able to return to Buenos Aires in 1822 due to the oblivion law.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>finally</b> able to {{gain access}} to the Adriatic by {{capturing}} Lissus and its seemingly impregnable citadel, after which the surrounding territories surrendered. Perhaps the capture of Lissus rekindled in Philip hopes of an Italian invasion. However the loss of his fleet meant that Philip would be dependent on Carthage for passage to and from Italy, making the prospect of invasion considerably less appealing.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the rebellion Henry le Despenser appointed John Derlington, the archdeacon of Norwich, as his vicar-general on 5 February 1400 and then submitted himself to the custody of Archbishop Arundel who accompanied him to Parliament on 20 January 1401. There his enemy Sir Thomas Erpingham falsely accused him of being involved in the plot. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>finally</b> reconciled to Henry IV when the king granted him a pardon in 1401.|$|E

5|$|After France surrendered, Marcinkus {{managed to}} make his way to the French colonies in Africa (Morocco and Algeria). He decided to go to Great Britain and {{continue}} fighting, but the French army's terms of armistice at Compiègne and tensions between Britain and France made this difficult. On 12 August 1940 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finally</b> demobilized from the French army. Marcinkus and some of his associates concocted a daring plan to commandeer several aircraft without authorization and fly to England. The plan was not executed due to increased security at airfields and other circumstances. He finally received the necessary documents enabling him to go to Britain in autumn of 1940.|$|E
5|$|Amid German defeats {{against the}} Russians on the Eastern Front after 1942, the King {{prepared}} {{for the end of}} the war. He ordered the preparation of a document, known as the Political Testament (Testament Politique), which would justify his behaviour under the occupation and detail his interventions on behalf of Belgian prisoners of war and deported workers. Leopold however continued to condemn the action of the Belgian government in exile (based in London after October 1940). On 7 June 1944, following D-Day, he was deported to Germany. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>finally</b> liberated by American forces on 7 May 1945.|$|E

5|$|Arundel's {{body was}} {{initially}} interred at the Franciscan church in Hereford. It {{had been his}} wish, however, to be buried at the family's traditional resting place of Haughmond Abbey in Shropshire, {{and this is where}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finally</b> buried. Though he was never canonised, a cult emerged around the late earl in the 1390s, associating him with the 9th-century martyr king St Edmund. This veneration may have been inspired by a similar cult around his grandson, Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel, who was executed by Richard II in 1397.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlin {{attended}} the Army War College from July 1932 to June 1933. Upon graduation, he was posted {{to the staff}} of the Army's Hawaiian Division at Fort Shafter, Hawaii, serving as Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3.

5|$|Despite his {{military}} background, Andronikos failed {{to deal with}} Isaac Komnenos, Béla III of Hungary (r. 1172–1196) who reincorporated Croatian territories into Hungary, and Stephen Nemanja of Serbia (r. 1166–1196) who declared his independence from the Byzantine Empire. Yet, none of these troubles would compare to William II of Sicily's (r. 1166–1189) invasion force of 300 ships and 80,000 men, arriving in 1185. Andronikos mobilised a small fleet of 100 ships to defend the capital, {{but other than that}} he was indifferent to the populace. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>finally</b> overthrown when Isaac Angelos, surviving an imperial assassination attempt, seized power with the aid of the people and had Andronikos killed.|$|E

5|$|Diefenbaker {{was born}} in southwestern Ontario {{in the small town}} of Neustadt, Ontario in 1895. In 1903, his family {{migrated}} west to the portion of the North-West Territories which would shortly thereafter become the province of Saskatchewan. He grew up in the province, and was interested in politics from a young age. After brief service in World War I, Diefenbaker became a noted criminal defence lawyer. He contested elections through the 1920s and 1930s with little success until <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finally</b> elected to the House of Commons in 1940.|$|E
5|$|During his quest, the Kid meets {{two more}} survivors: Zulf, an {{ambassador}} from the Ura, underground-dwelling {{people with whom}} Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl {{who was raised in}} Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal that the Kid discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists ("Mancers") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, so that when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finally</b> forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well.|$|E
5|$|Edward made {{alliances with}} the German king, the Counts of Flanders and Guelders, and the Burgundians, who would attack France from the north. The alliances proved volatile, however, and Edward was facing trouble {{at home at}} the time, both in Wales and Scotland. It was not until August 1297 that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finally</b> able to sail for Flanders, at which time his allies there had already {{suffered}} defeat. The support from Germany never materialised, and Edward was forced to seek peace. His marriage to Margaret in 1299 ended the war, but the whole affair had proven both costly and fruitless for the English.|$|E

5|$|Gjems-Onstad's {{cooperation}} with Hagen was however not to last. In early 1976 Gjems-Onstad voiced his discontent with the ever-ongoing conflicts within the party, {{and he had}} by mid-year not decided {{whether or not he}} wanted to run for re-election. He eventually felt squeezed out of the party, and wanted no part in the intriguing he considered Hagen to represent. He was replaced as parliamentary leader of the party at the start of October. After he in turn recommended voters to rather vote for the Conservative Party in an interview with Aftenposten, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finally</b> expelled from the party by a unanimously approved motion put forward by Carl I. Hagen later the same month. Gjems-Onstad finished his term as an independent.|$|E
5|$|He {{appealed to}} the House of Lords, who decided (led by Lord Birkenhead) {{that they did not}} have the {{jurisdiction}} to hear the appeal, since a rule of English law specifies that once a writ of habeas corpus is issued (as it was by the Court of Appeal) no superior court can overrule it. After a further attempt to keep O'Brien in custody (simply by not letting him out of prison) <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finally</b> released on 16 May.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{succession}} {{plans were}} thrown into chaos by {{the sinking of}} the White Ship on 25 November 1120. Henry had left the port of Barfleur for England in the early evening, leaving William Adelin and many of the younger members of the court to follow on that night in a separate vessel, the White Ship. Both the crew and passengers were drunk and, just outside the harbour, the ship hit a submerged rock. The ship sank, killing as many as 300 people, with only one survivor, a butcher from Rouen. Henry's court was initially too scared to report William's death to the King. When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finally</b> told, he collapsed with grief.|$|E

50|$|While never {{mentioned}} by name, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>finally</b> revealed to <b>be</b> of a dubious character. He voted against Smith and later Westerby thereby voting {{them out of}} the race for the Mastership. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> also said to be involved in inappropriate dealings about examination results.|$|R
5|$|Norman Uprichard (20 April 1928 – 31 January 2011) was a goalkeeper {{who began}} his career playing Gaelic Football with St. Peter's GAC.

He went on to play for Swindon Town, Portsmouth and Southend United at club level, and won 18 caps for Northern Ireland at international level.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 1956, Bánáthy was {{naturalized}} as a United States citizen. After {{nine years}} of separation, and repeated failures to get his sons repatriated from behind the Iron Curtain, Bánáthy obtained help from Dr. Eugene Blake, President of the National Council of Churches; Representative Charles M. Teague; Ernest Nagy, Vice Consul in the U.S. Legation in Budapest; Hulda Neiburh of the McCormick Theological Seminary; and Howard Pyle, deputy assistant to President Dwight D.

5|$|On May 19, 1865, Davis {{was imprisoned}} in a casemate at Fortress Monroe {{on the coast}} of Virginia. Irons were riveted to his ankles at the order of General Nelson Miles {{who was in charge of}} the fort. Davis was allowed no visitors, and no books except the Bible. He became sicker, and the {{attending}} physician warned that his life was in danger, but this treatment continued for some months until late autumn when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finally</b> given better quarters. General Miles was transferred in mid-1866, and Davis's treatment continued to improve.|$|E
