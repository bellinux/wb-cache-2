5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the <b>Gigafactory</b> 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Tesla makes {{electric}} induction motors with three phase, four pole AC and copper rotor. Motors for the Model S and Model X are made at Tesla Factory, while motors for Model 3 are made at <b>Gigafactory</b> 1.|$|E
25|$|Tesla {{stated that}} its {{automotive}} branch had a gross margin of 23.1% as of 2Q2016, and {{has generally been}} above 20%. However, expenditures for expanding future production (such as <b>Gigafactory</b> 1 and Model 3) are bigger than product profit, resulting in a net loss.|$|E
25|$|In May 2013 Tesla raised $1.02 billion ($660m from bonds) {{partially}} {{to repay}} the DOE loans (early) after their first profitable quarter. In February 2014 the company sold $2 billion in bonds (to build <b>GigaFactory</b> 1). In August 2015 Tesla sold $738 million in stock (for the Model X) and in May 2016 $1.46 billion in stock ($1.26 billion for the Model 3). As of January 29, 2016, Musk owned about 28.9 million Tesla shares, or about 22% of the total.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other automakers, Tesla {{does not}} use {{individual}} large battery cells, but thousands of small, cylindrical, lithium-ion commodity cells like those used in consumer electronics. It uses a version of these cells {{that is designed to}} be cheaper to manufacture and lighter than standard cells by removing some safety features. According to Tesla, these features are redundant because of the advanced thermal management system and an intumescent chemical in the battery to prevent fires. Panasonic is the sole supplier of the cells and cooperates with Tesla in the <b>Gigafactory</b> 1's '21-70' cells.|$|E
25|$|Buffalo's {{economic}} sectors include industrial, light manufacturing, high technology and services. The State of New York, with over 15,000 employees, is the city's largest employer. Other major employers include the United States government, Kaleida Health, M Bank (which is headquartered in Buffalo), the University at Buffalo, General Motors, Time Warner Cable and Tops Friendly Markets. Buffalo {{is home to}} Rich Products, Canadian brewer Labatt, cheese company Sorrento Lactalis, Delaware North Companies and New Era Cap Company. More recently, the Tesla <b>Gigafactory</b> 2 opened in South Buffalo in summer 2017, {{as a result of}} the Buffalo Billion program.|$|E

2500|$|Morningstar analyst David Whiston foresaw a revised, slower {{timetable}} for the Model 3 and a company acknowledgement {{of problems with}} building battery packs for its cars. In 2016 Musk predicted 100,000 Model 3 units would be sold in 2017, but that production may reach only 20,000 by December. Axel Schmidt, a managing director at consulting firm Accenture, said that Tesla’s problems with <b>Gigafactory</b> 1 prove that increasing Model 3 production [...] "remains a huge challenge".|$|E
2500|$|Tesla {{opened its}} first European store in June 2009 in London. Tesla's European {{headquarters}} are in Amsterdam.

2500|$|The {{batteries}} are {{placed under the}} vehicle floor. This saves interior and trunk space but increases risk of battery damage by debris or impact. The Model S has [...] aluminum-alloy armor plate. CTO Straubel expected batteries to last 10–15 years, and discounts using electric cars to charge the grid (V2G) because the related battery wear outweighs economic benefit. He also prefers recycling over re-use for grid once they {{reach the end of}} their useful life for vehicles. Since 2008, Tesla has worked with ToxCo/Kinsbursky to recycle worn out RoHS batteries, which will {{be an integral part of}} <b>GigaFactory.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Tesla's {{lithium-ion}} batteries contain {{small amounts of}} nickel and cobalt, the extraction and refining {{of which has been}} identified by the EPA as having a high potential for environmental impact due to the toxicity of the refining processes. Tesla claims to recycle all the battery packs that are returned to the company, and is optimistic that its <b>Gigafactory</b> 1, once fully operational, will be capable of recycling {{a significant part of the}} elements from old batteries, approaching a [...] "closed loop" [...] in which old batteries are turned into new batteries. Tesla has worked with ToxCo/Kinsbursky in the US since 2008 and Umicore in Europe to recycle worn out RoHS batteries, which will be performed at the new factory. While ToxCo/Kinsbursky uses a hydro-metallurgical process to recover lithium from the battery, Umicore only recovers nickel and cobalt for reuse in new batteries and turns approximately 30% of the battery, including the battery's lithium, into slag that is sold to steel refiners and cement manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|Tesla <b>Gigafactory</b> Europe is a {{proposed}} manufacturing plant for Tesla, Inc. {{to be located}} in Europe.

[...] The factory was previously referred to as <b>Gigafactory</b> 2 until 22 February 2017, which Tesla began to refer to the SolarCity <b>Gigafactory</b> in Buffalo, New York as <b>Gigafactory</b> 2. The Europe <b>Gigafactory</b> will be named either <b>Gigafactory</b> 3, 4, or 5.|$|E

After receiving $800M of orders ($179M PowerWall, $625M PowerPack) within 1 week of unveiling, Musk estimated that the <b>Gigafactory</b> 1 is not enough to supply demand.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Gigafactory</b> is {{intended}} to produce battery packs for Model 3, but it was announced at the Nevada State of the State Address in January 2017 that Tesla will also manufacture drive units at the <b>Gigafactory.</b> In February 2017, Tesla said that installation of Model 3 manufacturing equipment is underway in the Fremont factory and at <b>Gigafactory</b> 1, where in January, production of battery cells for energy storage products began, which have the same form-factor as the cells {{that will be used}} in Model 3.|$|E

50|$|Initial public {{mention of}} the <b>gigafactory</b> concept was made in November 2013, {{although}} Tesla's internal plans predated that; Tesla had investigated almost 100 sites.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{building}} of more gigafactories (see below), Tesla may expand and potentially double the size of <b>Gigafactory</b> 1.

[...] "The purchase gives us the opportunity for future growth." [...] In Tesla's dealings {{with the state of}} Nevada expanding the size was always an option should the company choose to do so, said Steve Hill, director of the Governor's Office of Economic Development. [...] "Tesla had said that the factory will be up to 10 million square feet million square meters in one or two stories," [...] Hill said.
