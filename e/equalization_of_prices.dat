Under the {{gold standard}}, each countrys money supply consisted of either gold or paper currency backed by gold. Money supply would hence fall in the deficit nation and rise in the surplus nation. Consequently, internal prices would fall in the deficit nation and rise in the surplus nation, making the exports of the deficit nation more competitive {{than those of the}} surplus nations. The deficit nations exports would be encouraged and the imports would be discouraged till the deficit in the balance of payments was eliminated.|$|E

30|$|In a 3 -period {{overlapping}} generations {{model with}} two countries, this paper proposed an alternative theory of international migration. Indeed, {{contrary to the}} traditional literature on international migration, in this model, international migrations cease due to the optimal legal system each social planner implements in his country. Differences in social planners’ decisions are {{due to differences in}} the return to education across countries. As a consequence, each social planer does not chose the same level of migrants in each country. Thus, an optimal legal system for migration emerges and generates endogenous two sided borders across countries. Even if each country uses the same method for designing its optimal international migration policy, the optimal level of migration flows varies across countries. The first natural consequences are the non <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> and there always remains wage differentials and an interest rate differentials across countries in the post-migration steady-state equilibrium with optimal legal systems of international migration. Since migration flows are unilateral, a second natural consequence of the non-equalization of the steady-states is that incentives for illegal migration always exists.|$|E
40|$|Almost 80 {{percent of}} capital goods {{production}} {{in the world is}} concentrated in 10 countries. Poor countries import most of their capital goods. We argue that interna-tional trade in capital goods has quantitatively important effects on economic develop-ment through two channels: (i) capital formation and (ii) aggregate TFP. We embed a multi country, multi sector Ricardian model of trade into a neoclassical growth model. Barriers to trade result in a misallocation of factors both within and across countries. We calibrate the model to bilateral trade flows, prices, and income per worker. Our model matches several trade and development facts within a unified framework. It is consistent with the world distribution of capital goods production, cross-country dif-ferences in investment rate and <b>price</b> <b>of</b> final goods, and cross-country <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> capital goods and marginal product of capital. The cross-country income dif-ferences decline by more than 50 percent when distortions to trade are eliminated, with 80 percent of the change in each country’s income attributable to change in capital. Autarky in capital goods results in an income loss of 17 percent for poor countries...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of many previously-closed low-income countries {{into the world}} economy, starting around 1980, {{has been referred to}} as the Third Wave of Globalization. Large low-wage economies that opened to trade such as China, India, and Mexico led to an unprecedented <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> goods <b>prices</b> between rich and poor countries during this time. The Factor-Price Equalization Theorem, a standard part of modern trade theory, predicts that <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> goods <b>prices</b> should lead to an <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> factor <b>prices</b> between high-wage countries such as the United States, and low-wage countries like India and China. Unlike the Second Wave of Globalization, 1945 - 1980, which was primarily among rich countries with similar factor prices ex ante, the Third Wave of Globalization between rich and poor countries should lead to a much greater adjustment in factor prices. Gains in U. S. real compensation during the Second Wave period were nearly equal to gains in productivity, as compensation of factors moved proportionally to their marginal products. However, in the 1980 - 2003 period, real compensation in the non-farm business sector grew at only 52 percent of the rate at which labor productivity increased. For the non-financial corporate sector, labor compensation grew at only 36 percent of the growth rate of labor productivity. The purpose of our paper is to explain the breakdown in the relationship between labor productivity and compensation gains in the United States during the Third Wave period, and to consider who may be capturing those gains. We examine the possibilities that the gains may have been captured by capital in the U. S., or my have been transferred abroad to U. S. trading partners by movements in the terms of trade, and to present evidence relating to both. It appears that neither U. S. labor nor U. S. capital are fully capturing those gains and that a portion of U. S. productivity benefits are leaking out of the United States...|$|R
30|$|Since some {{countries}} adopt implicit legal systems of migration to avoid brain waste, {{we choose to}} build a model where only young individuals are allowed to permanently migrate. The reason is that sending countries loose their human capital throughout the migrant’s life-cycle, as mentioned above. Subsection 8.4 discusses the possibility of return migrations. For now, immigrants will obtain a high education degree in the destination country and get the return to education in this country. The post-migration steady-state equilibrium {{is a function of}} the flow of migrants, which is an instrument for the domestic migration policy. Since countries differ with respect to their return to education, incentives for migration exist. The way migration ceases is not a pure market mechanism but the result of the social planner’s decision. The social planner chooses the level of migrants that leads his country to the post-migration static welfare optimum. Due to differences in the return to education, social planners choose different migration flows. Closing borders also means preventing market <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> in the long run, contrary toGalor (1986).|$|E

We establish the existence of two country balanced growth equilibria in which physical and human capital grow {{at the same rate}} in each country but physical/human capital ratios differ across countries. These balanced growth equilibria satisfy a static and dynamic version of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem. We also show the existence of unbalanced growth equilibria in which the static and dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin theorems can be violated. The multiplicity of paths with international trade results from the intertemporal no arbitrage condition in cases where trade results in an <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> factor <b>prices</b> across countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} results of Neary (1979) where it was shown that, when an {{appropriate}} aggregation procedure is adopted, many of {{the properties of the}} two-factor, two-commodity Heckscher-Ohlin model continue to hold in a general production model with any numbers of goods and factors. In the present paper it is shown that, if the number of goods and factors are the same (though still arbitrarily large) and if joint production and intermediate goods are ruled out, then the parallel between the properties of the standard Heckscher-Ohlin model and the aggregated model is greatly strenghtened. In particular, the <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> factor <b>prices</b> between "similiar" free-trading economies and, with some additional restrictions, the "magnification" effects associated with the Rybczynski and Stolper-Samuelson theorems are shown to hold in the aggregated model.

40|$|We outline six {{facts that}} should be {{explained}} by an international growth model: 1) Conditional convergence; 2) cross-country dispersion of growth rates; 3) cross-country dispersion of per capita income levels; 4) cross-country dispersion of savings rates; 5) within country correlation of savings and investment and 6) cross-country equality of real rates of interest. We argue that the neoclassical model performs poorly in several dimensions and we provide an alternative two-sector endogenous growth model {{based on the work}} of Lucas and Romer that can account for all of our stylized facts. Our model accounts for the observation that poor countries grow faster than rich ones (fact number 1) as a consequence of the transitional dynamics of the ratio of physical to human capital. We show that opening capital mobility across countries does not necessarily equate the physical to human capital ratios across countries despite the resultant <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> factor <b>prices.</b> endogenous growth; interdependent world economy...|$|R
40|$|I use the STAN {{database}} of the OECD and different econometric methods {{to investigate the}} effects of exports towards the EU- 15 on wages in the Visegrad countries (CEEC- 4; Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia). The results do not allow to draw any definite statements about this effect. While the impact of exports towards the EU- 15 on wages in the countries investigated {{is likely to be}} negative in the short run (1 - 2 years), it seems to be positive in the medium and long run, at least for Hungary and Poland. Nevertheless, {{it is clear that the}} pattern of the CEEC- 4 exports towards the EU- 15 does not correspond with the predictions of the Heckscher-Ohlin model. Therefore, also the theorems of Stolper and Samuelson (1941) and concerning the <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> factor <b>prices,</b> which are based on the Heckscher-Ohlin model, do not seem accurate to describe the underlying forces linking trade with factor prices. I argue that missing regional and related inter-sectoral labor mobility might be a potential factor preventing employees from taking advantage of trade liberalization.

40|$|Abstract: The {{origins of}} the Marxian Transformation Problem lie in the {{differences}} between two central abstractions of classical political economy, the labour theory of value and the <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> the rate of profit through competition among capitals. Marx proposed that these two principles could be reconciled by distinguishing the production of surplus-value through the exploitation of labour {{in the process of}} production from the realization of surplus-value through the price system, and claimed that the <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> the rate of profit could be viewed as a redistribution of a given surplus-value among sectors. Marx's treatment {{can be seen as a}} generalization of the discussion of this problem in Smith and Ricardo. Modern criticisms of Marx's discussion claim that the labour theory of value is an unnecessary detour to the determination <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> and profit rates, and that Marx's claims that total value and surplus-value are conserved when prices equalize profit rates is unfounded. The Single-System Labour Theory of Value (SS-LTV) interpretation maintains Marx’s two fundamental claims in the following formulations: (1) the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> the net product is the expression in <b>prices</b> (<b>price</b> form) <b>of</b> the total value-creating labour expanded during the period, and (2) total profits are the <b>price</b> form <b>of</b> surplus-value, determining the value of labour-power a...|$|R
