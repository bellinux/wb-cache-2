Inedible <b>egg</b> <b>product</b> did not improve growth or feed efficiency of pigs compared with those fed the control diet during the 2 -week treatment period. However, SDP increased body weight gain and feed efficiency during the treatment period. The improved performance over the control group that resulted from feeding a combination of SDP and <b>egg</b> <b>product</b> was primarily dependent upon the SDP.

40|$|This {{work has}} been {{supported}} by the grant Reducing Egg Susceptibility to Contamination in Avian Production in Europe (RESCAPE) from the European Commission (FOOD-CT- 2006 - 036018). Bacillus cereus group bacteria are opportunistically pathogenic spore-forming microorganisms {{well known in the}} sector of pasteurized food products because of their involvement in spoilage events. In the sector of <b>egg</b> <b>product</b> processing, these bacteria may lead to important economic losses. It seemed then relevant to study their behavior in egg white, a widely used <b>egg</b> <b>product</b> usually recognized as developing different levels of antimicrobial activities depending on the environmental conditions. A strong bactericidal effect (decrease in the bacterial population of 6. 1 ± 0. 2 log CFU/ml) was observed for 68 B. cereus group isolates, independently incubated at 30 °C in egg white at pH 9. 3 (natural egg white pH). To determine which components could explain such a strong bactericidal effect, an experimental strategy was carried out, based on egg white fractionation by ultrafiltration and by anion-exchange liquid chromatography. The role of the protein fraction was thus demonstrated, and subsequent nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses allowed identification of ovotransferrin as a major protein involved. The strong bactericidal effect was confirmed in the presence of commercial ovotransferrin. Such a bactericidal effect (i. e., a decrease in the bacterial population through cell death) had never been described because ovotransferrin is known for its bacteriostatic effect (i. e., inhibition of growth) due to its ability to chelate iron. Surprisingly, the addition of iron did not reverse the bactericidal effect of ovotransferrin under alkaline conditions (pH 9. 3), whereas it completely reversed this effect at pH 7. 3. Ovotransferrin was shown to provoke a perturbation of the electrochemical potential of the cytoplasmic membrane. A membrane disturbance mechanism could, hence, be involved, leading to the lysis of B. cereus group bacteria incubated in egg white...|$|E

In the pure egg systems, the water activity (a(,w)) lowering ability of egg white was the highest, followed in order by whole egg and egg yolk. However, the sorption pattern was reversed when the food humectants were employed as the a(,w) controlling agents. Of the five humectants, sodium chloride exhibited the highest a(,w) depressing effect in all the egg systems followed by glycerol, propylene glycol, glucose and sucrose in order of effectiveness.

However, there are few studies investigating this ability for Salmonella Typhimurium. The hypothesis of this study was that the Salmonella Typhimurium can colonise the gut for a prolonged period of time and that horizontal infection through feces is the main route of egg contamination. At 14 weeks of age hens were orally infected with either S. Typhimurium PT 9 or S. Typhimurium PT 9 and Salmonella Mbandaka. Salmonella shedding in feces and eggs was monitored for 15 weeks post infection. Egg shell surface and internal contents of eggs laid by infected hens were cultured independently for detection of Salmonella spp. The mean Salmonella load in feces ranged from 1. 54 to 63. 35 and 0. 31 to 98. 38 most probable number/g (MPN/g) in the S.
