5|$|Much of {{the growth}} of Portishead's {{population}} {{can be attributed to the}} development of the former docks into a vibrant community. The former deep-water dock, used to supply coal and <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> the power stations, has been fully redeveloped into a modern marina with 250 pontoon berths.|$|E
5|$|Part of modern-day NY311 {{from the}} NY292 {{intersection}} to the route's ending terminus was {{once part of}} the Philipstown Turnpike.

5|$|Spain {{discouraged}} {{manufacturing in}} its colonies and limited trade to Spanish goods handled by Spanish merchants and carried on Spanish vessels. Most of the ports, including {{all of those}} in Texas, were closed to commercial vessels {{in the hopes of}} dissuading smugglers. By law, all goods bound for Texas had to be shipped to Veracruz and then transported over the mountains to Mexico City before being sent to Texas. This caused the <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> be very expensive in the Texas settlements. Settlers were often forced to turn to the French for supplies, as the fort at Natchitoches was well-stocked and goods did not have to travel as far. Without many <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> trade, however, the remaining Spanish missionaries and colonists had little to offer the Indians, who remained loyal to the French traders.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Honduras used one helicopter to deliver relief <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> stranded residents on roofs.

5|$|The {{high levels}} of poverty in the East End have, {{throughout}} history, corresponded with {{a high incidence of}} crime. From earliest times, crime depended, as did labour, on the importing of <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> London, and their interception in transit. Theft occurred in the river, on the quayside and in transit to the City warehouses. This was why, in the 17th century, the East India Company built high-walled docks at Blackwall and had them guarded to minimise the vulnerability of their cargoes. Armed convoys would then take the <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> the company's secure compound in the City. The practice {{led to the creation of}} ever-larger docks throughout the area, and large roads to drive through the crowded 19th century slums to carry goods from the docks.|$|E

5|$|Armenia {{announced}} {{its decision to}} join the Eurasian Customs Union in September 2013. President Serj Sargsyan announced the decision after talks with his Russian counterpart President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The treaty enlarging the EEU to Armenia was signed on 9 October 2014. Armenia {{is the only country}} of the EEU that has no common border with the other member states of the union. Georgia guaranteed a free transit corridor for exporting its <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> the Eurasian Economic Union, Armenian deputy economy minister Emil Tarasyan said.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{was also}} {{concerned}} with easing overland transport of <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> Virginia. In mid-1795, he, Robert Barr, Elijah Craig, and Harry Toulmin formed {{a committee to}} raise funds for a road connecting the Cumberland Gap to central Kentucky. Breckinridge was disappointed with the quality of the route, which was finished in late 1796, concluding that the individual maintaining it was keeping most of the tolls instead of using them for the road's upkeep.|$|E

5|$|Carroll {{improved}} his fortunes through a judicious marriage. In November 1689, he wed Martha Ridgely Underwood, a widow whose two former husbands {{had left her}} a small fortune. Carroll inherited a portion of this fortune after Martha's death in 1690 in childbirth. The child, named Anthony in honor of Carroll's brother, also died. Restricted in his law practice by the new Protestant government, Carroll used the inheritance to begin importing <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> the colony. He also purchased a store {{in the town of}} Annapolis.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{opposition}} the Coffin family's {{desire to help}} the runaway slaves only increased. Coffin's wife, Catharine, who was also dedicated to the effort, organized a sewing society that met at their home to produce clothing {{to give to the}} runaways. She also provided meals and shelter to runaway slaves in the Coffin home. Other aid was obtained from neighbors and others sympathetic to the cause, but were unwilling take the fugitives into their homes. Through these activities Coffin was able to secure a steady supply of <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> assist in the ongoing operations.|$|E
5|$|During the 58-day voyage, twopeople died {{of illness}} and onewoman {{gave birth to a}} child. The voyage to Santo Domingo had lasted longer than expected, and {{provisions}} ran low, especially after the loss of the St. Fran√ßois. La Salle had little money with which to replenish supplies, and finally two of the merchants aboard the expedition sold some of their trade <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> the islanders, and lent their profits to La Salle. To fill the gaps left after several men deserted, La Salle recruited a few islanders to join the expedition.|$|E

5|$|Having {{learned about}} the block-booking studio system that almost {{guaranteed}} the studios huge profits, Cagney was determined to spread the wealth. He regularly sent money and <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> old friends from his neighborhood, {{though he did not}} generally make this known. His insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors‚Äîeven teenagers‚Äîregularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films. This experience was an integral reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{commercial}} activity {{shifted from the}} major trade routes of the Old World to newer routes between modern nation-states. This activity was sometimes carried out without traditional protection of trade and under international free-trade agreements, which allowed commercial <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> cross borders with relaxed restrictions. Innovative transportation of modern times includes pipeline transport and the relatively well-known trade involving rail routes, automobiles, and cargo airlines.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, Banagher was {{the centre}} of a flourishing woollen trade.

In 1780, the British Parliament withdrew all these restrictions and Banagher's economy began to improve rapidly.|$|E
