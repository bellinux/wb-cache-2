40|$|The {{operating}} factors were studied for an axial-flow corn shelling unit that affected losses and power consumption. The shelling unit was 0. 90  m long, with a diameter {{toward the end}} of the peg tooth of 0. 30  m. The factors comprised three levels of moisture content (MC), three levels of feed rate (FR), and three levels of rotor speed (RS). The experiments were conducted based on response surface methodology and 23 factorial designs. The results of this study indicated that the MC significantly affected <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> and power consumption, but did not affect shelling unit losses. Increasing the MC increased both the <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> and power consumption. The FR affected the power consumption but did not affect shelling unit losses and <b>grain</b> <b>breakage.</b> Increasing the FR increased the power consumption. The RS had a significant impact on the shelling unit losses, <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> and power consumption. Increasing the RS increased the <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> and power consumption, but decreased the shelling unit losses. Empirical models were formulated based on multiple linear models...|$|E

40|$|International audienceVarious {{mechanisms}} {{can affect}} the permeability of dense unconsolidated sands: Volumetric dilation can lead to permeability increase, whereas strain localization in shear bands may increase or decrease the permeability depending {{on the state of}} compaction and on the level of <b>grains</b> <b>breakage</b> inside the band. To investigate these various mechanisms, an experimental study has been performed to explore the effect of different factors such as grain size and grain shape, confining pressure, level of shear, stress path, and formation of one or several shear bands on the permeability of dense sands under triaxial loading. The experimental results show a reduction of permeability during the consolidation phase and during the volumetric contraction phase of shear loading, which can be related to the decrease of porosity. The experimental results also show that, depending on the confining pressure, the permeability remains stable or decreases during the volumetric dilation phase despite the increase of total porosity. This permeability reduction is attributed to the presence of fine particles, which result from grains attrition during pre-localization and <b>grains</b> <b>breakage</b> inside the shear band during the post-localization phase...|$|R

40|$|The {{mathematical}} relationship (breakage equation) {{between the}} inlet and outlet particle-size distributions of a roller milling operation is described, and the breakage function linking {{the two is}} defined. The forms of the breakage equation and the breakage function are different for roller milling than for other comminution operations, such as hammer milling or ball milling. The breakage equation is discretised to give a matrix form, from which it is demonstrated that during roller milling of wheat, particles break independently of one another. This is an important assumption of breakage equations for many comminution operations and experimental results are presented, which confirm its applicability to the roller milling of wheat <b>grains.</b> <b>Breakage</b> matrices are successfully used to predict the outlet particle-size distributions from First Break milling of wheat.

40|$|International audienceA novel {{approach}} has been developed to predict the mechanical behavior of very coarse granular materials with a constitutive model, which considers both <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> and size effect. The behavior of granular assemblies is significantly influenced by particle breakage. A critical-state double-yield-surface model incorporating {{the change in the}} critical-state line and in elastic stiffness caused by <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> during loading has been adopted. The amount of <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> was estimated by extending the size effect theory on individual grains to granular assemblies. The results from earlier studies on granular materials with parallel gradations have been usefully exploited to calibrate and to validate the model.

40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the potential for selection of maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes that produce grain resistant to physical injury. The materials evaluated were S 1 and S 2 lines derived from BS 17 and BS 1 (HS) C 1 and S 2 lines derived from BS 1 (HS) C 1 in hybrid combinations with B 73 and MO 17. Eight plant and grain traits (kernel shear strength, visual endosperm rating, date of anthesis, harvest moisture, <b>grain</b> <b>breakage,</b> 300 -kernel weight, 300 -kernel volume, and kernel density) were evaluated for the S 1 and S 2 lines from BS 17 and BS 1 (HS) C 1. Also, five plant and grain traits (root lodging, stalk lodging, <b>grain</b> <b>breakage,</b> harvest moisture, and grain yield) of BS 1 (HS) C 1 S 2 lines and S 2 line testcross hybrids were evaluated. All materials were grown at two locations, one year for each generation (visual endosperm rating and date of anthesis were evaluated only at Ames);Statistical analyses revealed significant genetic variability in BS 17 and BS 1 (HS) C 1 for all traits. Estimated genotype-by-environment variance components for physical grain quality traits were 0 to 66 % as large as the estimated genotypic variance components. Heritability estimates (entry mean basis) for <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> ranged from 0. 48 to 0. 67. Nonadditive gene action for <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> was indicated by a highly significant S 2 line-by-tester interaction. Because the means of S 2 lines and S 2 line testcross hybrids for <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> were similar in magnitude, the presence of nonadditive gene action may be the consequence of bi-directional dominance;The optimum harvest moisture range for physical grain quality preservation was 19 to 26 %. Increasing deviations from this optimum range resulted in increasing <b>grain</b> <b>breakage.</b> Grain resistant to breakage tended to be smaller, denser, and higher in shear strength. Correlations of the same traits between generations indicated that S 1 and S 2 line means would have predictive value for S 2 line and S 2 line testcross hybrid means, respectively. The data indicated that selection of S 1 lines with breakage-resistant grain would result in earlier flowering S 2 lines with smaller kernels. A small, positive correlation between S 2 line <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> and S 2 line testcross hybrid yield revealed that selection of S 2 lines with superior physical grain quality could result in lower yielding S 2 line testcross hybrids...|$|E

40|$|Two {{kinds of}} shear tests, the Iosipescu shear {{test and the}} torsion test were used for {{studying}} the shear damage of aluminium alloy 2024 T 3. In the Iosipescu test, a specially designed shear fixture was used. The Iosipescu specimen was deformed under simple shear. After shear fracture, the Iosipescu specimen was polished and etched for microscopic examination. In the torsion test, the curve surface Moiré method was applied to determine the shear damage variable of the aluminium alloy. The results of the microscopic examination show that rotation and distortion of <b>grains,</b> <b>breakage</b> of particles and microcracks occurred in the shear band.

40|$|Copyright © 2017 by the American Rock Mechanics Association. ARMA 17 - 470 During the {{confined}} comminution of granular materials, {{the work}} input {{is transformed into}} elastic energy stored in the <b>grains,</b> <b>breakage</b> energy used to generate new surfaces, energy dissipated by friction between grains in contact, and redistribution energy dissipated by the relative movement of crushed fragments. We assume that the expression of Particle Size Distribution (PSD) in a crushed sample {{is a function of}} a fractal distribution and a uniform distribution. This allows calculating the breakage parameter, the increase of surface energy, and finally the energy dissipated by breakage. By summing the contact energy at all the contacts within a sample, we calculate the elastic energy stored. The calculation of friction-dissipated energy requires calculating relative movements of contacts, which are highly unpredictable especially when crushing is involved. Thus we include the dissipation that results from the relative displacement of grains in contact (including both crushed fragments and surrounding intact grains) in the friction-dissipated energy. We obtain the friction-dissipated energy by subtracting the elastic energy stored in the <b>grains</b> and the <b>breakage</b> energy from the input energy. The results show that the energy distribution is stress sensitive and changes a lot with the increase of compressive stress. Energy dissipation by friction plays a major role during confined comminution...|$|R
40|$|Severe plastic {{deformation}} techniques are acknowledged to produce elongated grains during fabrication of nanostructured materials. Previous models relating grain size to mechanical properties considered only equivalent radius, thus ignoring other approaches of measuring grain sizes such as semiminor axis, semimajor axis, and major axis radii that determine true grain shape. In this paper, stochastic models of nanomaterials mechanical properties {{that include the}} ignored parameters have been proposed. The proposed models are tested with data from nanocrystalline aluminum samples. The following facts were experimentally observed and also revealed by the models. Grain elongates to a maximum value and then decreases with further grain refinement due to <b>grain</b> <b>breakages.</b> Materials yield stress increases with elongation to a maximum and then decreases continuously. The varying approaches of measuring grain radius reveal a common trend of Hall-Petch and Reverse Hall-Petch Relationship but with different critical grain sizes. Materials with high curvature grains have more enhanced yield stress. Reducing strain rates leads to materials with more enhanced yield stress, with critical strain rates values beyond which further reductions do not lead to yield stress enhancement. It can be concluded that, by considering different approaches of measuring grain sizes, reasons for different yield stress for nanomaterials that were observed but could not be explained have been dealt with...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} some {{conditions which}} cause <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> and grain loss during harvesting process of horizontal roller corn harvester. If the transmission rate between two snapping rollers can be changed, the <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> and grain loss {{can be solved}} at a certain level. So a pair of differential speed snapping rollers for horizontal roller corn harvester was designed, and the work effects between the constant speed snapping rollers and the differential speed snapping rollers were compared by using software CATIA and ADAMS, {{and found that the}} rolling speed of inner snapping roller is 500 r/min, and the outer snapping roller is 460 r/min are the best transmission rate. Finally, a physical experiment was conducted to certificate the simulation effect. In or-der to avoid some disadvantages of field experiment and soil bin experiment in laboratory, half laboratory and half field environment were used in this physical experiment. As a result, the physical experiment confirmed that the analyses above and the simulation by ADAMS were valid.

40|$|International audienceGranular {{materials}} are constituted of an assembly of particles. In {{spite of the}} simplicity of this assembly, its mechanical behaviour is complex. In the first stage we propose a framework to establish correlations between parameters of the supposedly continuous medium and grain properties which {{are assumed to be}} constant. However, this hypothesis is no longer valid in the case where physical (shape, size…) or mechanical properties (Young modulus Eg, Poisson's ratio νg…) of grains evolve during loading, causing the behaviour of the assembly to modify. We study the influence of the physical and mechanical parameters on <b>grain</b> <b>breakage.</b> We subsequently propose a way to model the influence of the <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> on granular materials and we introduce this influence in an elastoplastic constitutive model. Validations are made on two kinds of sands under isotropic and triaxial loading. Since the results of numerical computations corresponded well with the experimental data, we believe that the new model is capable of accurately simulating the behaviour of granular materials under a wide range of stresses and of taking into account, through new parameters, the individual strength of grains...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} metalliferous grains on {{electrical}} comminution efficiency was investigated by comparative experiments using natural rocks and synthetic samples. The result {{indicated that the}} existence of metalliferous <b>grains</b> affects the <b>breakage</b> probability and product size distribution of electrical comminution. On average, metalliferous <b>grains</b> increased the <b>breakage</b> probability of particle in the first pulse discharge by 55 % and generated finer product at the coarse end. As a result, particles with metalliferous grains exhibited higher energy efficiency than that without metalliferous grain in electrical comminution. A positive linear relation between product fineness and specific energy in electrical comminution was observed. With the assistance of numerical simulation on the electrical field distribution of ore particle, the role of metalliferous grains in electrical comminution is confirmed and the mechanism of metalliferous grains effect is elucidated. Understanding of the effect of metalliferous grains on electrical comminution is important to evaluate the feasibility of applying electrical comminution to ores with different mineral composition, and to understand the breakage behavior in electrical comminution...|$|R

40|$|Presented at Mechanical Behavior of Salt VIII, Rapid City, South Dakota, 26 - 28 May 2015. Underground salt {{cavities}} {{used for}} {{compressed air energy storage}} undergo cyclic loads and {{are subject to}} a fatigue phenomenon that reduces rock strength and stiffness. Understanding such behaviors and developing relevant constitutive models require a micro-mechanical analysis. This study investigates damage and fatigue in salt rock, the extent of which is influenced by its polycrystalline nature, on the basis of self-consistent upscaling approaches for viscous heterogeneous materials. We develop a model that treats monocrystals as spherical inclusions embedded in an infinite homogeneous matrix with purely elastic inclusion-matrix interactions. To predict <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> and its subsequent impact, we also introduce a failure criterion. The model provides micro-mechanical interpretations of the common viscoplastic and fatigue behavior of salt such as damage and accelerated creep from <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> and the shakedown effect observed in elastoplastic media. Finite element (FE) simulations confirmed the macrostrain and microstress predictions obtained by homogenization. The FE program will be used in future studies to simulate inter-granular fracture propagation.

40|$|We {{describe}} the shear flow of a disordered granular {{material in the}} presence of grain fracture using the shear-transformation-zone (STZ) theory of amorphous plasticity adapted to systems with a hard-core inter-particle interaction. To this end, we develop the equations of motion for this system within a statistical-thermodynamic framework analogous to that used in the analysis of molecular glasses. For hard-core systems, the amount of internal, configurational disorder is characterized by the compactivity X = ∂ V / ∂ S_C, where V and S_C are respectively the volume and configurational entropy. <b>Grain</b> <b>breakage</b> is described by a constitutive equation for the temporal evolution of a characteristic grain size a, based on fracture mechanics. We show that <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> is a weakening mechanism, significantly lowering the flow stress at large strain rates, if the material is rate-strengthening in character. We show in addition that if the granular material is sufficiently aged, spatial inhomogeneity in configurational disorder results in strain localization.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to explain the origin of fatigue observed in salt rock subject to cyclic loading. We used a self-consistent homogenization scheme to upscale the viscoplastic and damage behavior of halite polycrystals from mono-crystal viscous glide and breakage mechanisms. We modeled mono-crystals as spherical inclusions embedded in an infinite homogeneous matrix, and we assumed purely elastic inclusion/matrix interactions. We introduced a failure criterion at the mono-crystal scale in order to predict <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> and the subsequent damage effects on salt rock elastic moduli. We wrote an algorithm that allows computing macroscopic and microscopic stresses and strains during creep and cyclic axial loading.

40|$|Abstract: The creep {{behavior}} of two series of magnesium alloys, Mg- 4 Al based alloys with strontium addition and binary Mg-Nd alloys, has been studied. Results {{show that the}} high creep properties achieved by the Mg-Nd alloys are attributed to the precipitation of tiny dispersed β’ particles, which form and effectively restrict the dislocation slipping and climb during creep deformation. In terms of values of the stress exponent and apparent activation energy gained from systematic creep tests, the mechanism responsible for creep deformation of the Mg-Nd alloys is inferred as dislocation climb, which is supported by TEM observations performed on the Mg- 2 Nd alloy after creep test. For the Mg- 4 Al based alloys, however, microstructural observations reveal that the significant improvement on creep properties caused by Sr addition is accounted {{for the formation of}} an interphase network consisting of Al 4 Sr and a Mg-Al-Sr ternary compound distributing at <b>grain</b> boundaries. The <b>breakage</b> of the interphase network after extrusion results in a sharp drop of creep properties, indicating the creep deformation of the alloy is controlled mainly by grain boundary sliding, which is in contradiction to the mechanism for creep of the alloys inferred by the classical criterions based on the values of stress exponent and apparent activation energy. 1...|$|R
40|$|Stress {{cracking}} due to {{high temperature}} drying has been of concern to the maize industry because {{it can lead to}} increases in broken grain and fine material during subsequent handling. In this study, several factors affecting physical characteristics of maize grain, particularly those related to stress cracking, were investigated. In the first year (1995 - 1996), the effects of several preharvest factors; hybrid, nitrogen, harvest grain moisture content, and postharvest drying factors including drying temperature and relative cooling rate on physical attributes and stress cracking in grain were investigated. Grain hardness (hard to soft endosperm ratio (H/S ratio)) was significantly affected by the interaction between hybrid and nitrogen. The effect of drying temperature and harvest moisture on drying time was dominant, while drying rate was significantly affected by hybrid and drying temperature. The effect of cooling rate on stress cracking and stress crack index (SCI) stood out among the main effects. At the lowest cooling rate of 0. 23 (°C/°C/min.) • 10 - 2, checked stress cracking (checking) was minimal, and SCI was less than 100. However, at higher cooling rates from 0. 55 to 1. 11 (°C/°C/min.) • 10 - 2, grains had more than 25 % multiple stress cracking, regardless of the levels of hybrid, nitrogen, harvest moisture and drying temperature. The predicted SCI for the three hybrids reached a maximum around at 0. 75 (°C/°C/min.) • 10 - 2, cooling rate, irrespective of levels of nitrogen and drying temperature. In the second experiment (1996 - 1997), the effects of grain hardness and morphological factors (grain size and shape) at a single grain drying rate and the development stress cracking over time were investigated. The re-parameterized Morgan-Mercer-Flodin (MMF) model successfully predicted the increasing rate (κ) and the maximum value (α) of percentage checking in various sizes, shapes and hardness of grains time after drying. From the data analysis, the maximum value of checking (α) showed a significant correlation with grain length (r = - 0. 707), thickness (r = 0. 620), roundness (r = 0. 703) and the shortest diffusion pathway (SDP; r = 0. 627). While, the increasing rate (κ) of percentage checking with time after drying was significantly correlated with grain bulk density (r = - 0. 564), hardness ratio (r = - 0. 611) and drying rate (r = 0. 551), {{and to a lesser extent}} (r > 0. 35), with the grain size parameters including hundred-grain weight, grain length, and width. Based on this result, it was suggested that removing small and rounded grains could reduce checked stress cracking by up to 40 to 50 % in some dent maize hybrids. In addition, the standardized multiple regression for single grain drying rate according to H/S ratio and grain weight accounted for from 65 to 74 % of the variation. Tempering grain at high temperatures reduced stress-cracked grains significantly. However, the effect of tempering on stress cracking in the hard grain hybrid was small. In the 1997 - 1998 experiment, a breakage tester (HT-I drop tester) was developed and single <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> at various grain temperatures and times after drying was determined. Both hard and soft maize hybrids had minimal breakage at high grain temperatures (78 to 110 °C), while decreasing grain temperature increased breakage exponentially. This indicated that grain temperature should be considered as a co-factor for measuring <b>grain</b> <b>breakage.</b> After drying at both 60 °C and 120 °C, the percentage breakage measured at ambient temperature increased rapidly during cooling in air at an ambient temperature of 20 °C and a relative humidity around 65 - 70 %. Breakage reached a maximum after about 10 minutes from the start of cooling. A Mitscherlich function was used to describe the chronological development of percent <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> and the analysis of the function parameters for the extent (maximum) and rate of breakage indicated that there was a significant interaction between hybrid and drying temperature for the development of <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> after drying. In conclusion, the MMF and Mitscherlich models described stress cracking and <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> during drying and cooling of maize grain. These studies provide valuable information to grain industries to assist with minimizing grain damage during drying...|$|E
40|$|Rice <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> during milling is {{a problem}} in many parts of Asia. It has been {{suggested}} that nitrogen (N) fertilizer can improve the milling quality of rice. Therefore, this study investigates effects of N fertilization on grain N concentration, endosperm storage protein distribution, and milling quality of rice. Four Thai extra long grain commercial rice cultivars (KDML 105, KLG 1, PTT 1, and CNT 1) were grown at Chiang Mai University in the wet season of 2001 with 0 or 120 kg of N/ha at flowering. Anatomical sections showed that there was more storage protein accumulated in the lateral regions of polished grain of high N concentration than in grain of low N concentration. Percent (%) unbroken rice was positively correlated with relative abundance of storage protein in the lateral region of the endosperm in all cultivars. Applying N increased head rice N concentration in all cultivars, whereas % unbroken rice was increased in KLG 1 and CNT 1. KDML 105 cultivar, on the other hand, already had high % unbroken rice and more abundant storage protein in the lateral region with the grain of low N concentration. It is hypothesized that high density of storage protein in the lateral region of the endosperm provides resilience and lessens <b>grain</b> <b>breakage</b> during milling. The additional protein may increase hardness in rice grains and thus could make the rice more resistant to breakage during milling. Furthermore, N fertilization may enhance the nutritional quality of rice grain by increasing the glutelin content, which is rich in lysine...|$|E

When these correspond to a scale that has been imaged at high spatial resolution, high-quality measurements can be obtained (e. g. 3 D displacements and rotations of individual grains of sand sample under load). However, there are issues when the scale of interest is smaller, for example the characterisation of grain-to-grain contacts (their orientations and evolution) or production of fines by <b>grain</b> <b>breakage.</b> This paper presents a short selection of new grain-scale measurements obtained using existing techniques. The challenges associated with smaller scale measurements on the same images are also discussed through a few examples from ongoing work...|$|E
40|$|Ballasted {{rail tracks}} {{offer the most}} {{important}} means of transporting bulk freight and passengers {{in terms of the}} sheer tonnage of traffic. Ballast is a prominent component of conventional rail infrastructure because it controls the stability and performance of track. Repetitive train loads degrade ballast <b>grains</b> due to <b>breakage</b> and the progressive accumulation of external fines or mud-pumping from the softer subgrade. They decrease the shear strength and drainage capacity of track embankments, while adversely affecting its safety and efficiency as speed restrictions are imposed and track maintenance becomes more frequent. Although synthetic inclusions such as geogrids and rubber mats placed between the ballast and subballast definitely improve track performance, further study is needed before incorporating them into existing design routines catering for future high speed trains and heavier haul trains. This paper presents the very latest knowledge of rail track geomechanics, including several important concepts and topics related to laboratory testing and discrete element modelling approaches to study the load and deformation of ballast improved by rubber mats and synthetic geogrids. This paper focuses on studies carried out at the University of Wollongong on track infrastructure, and includes examples whereby innovation progresses from theory to practice. Discrete element modelling is also used to carry out a micromechanical analysis of the ballast and geogrid interface to provide further insight into ballast subjected to shearing...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} discrete-element method (DEM) {{simulations}} of the breakage of fragile particles under growing oedometric load, motivated by applications to clinker grinding {{processes in the}} cement industry. The use of a simplified model, in which spherical beads break into smaller spherical fragments with some loss of volume, enables us to perform a systematic parametric study and to investigate collective effects, as the transfer of load to other particles following one breakage event may entail large scale avalanches or cascades involving the rupture of many grains. Particles are attributed random strengths, chosen according to Weibull distributions of varying width, and rupture criteria are defined either in terms of contact forces or of average stresses within the grain. A dimensionless parameter, ?S, is defined, which combines the influence of particle strength and contact stiffness. ?S expresses the characteristic contact deflection, relative to the particle diameter, at rupture. Model materials range from stiff-fragile (large ?S) to soft-strong (small ?S). Initial packings also differ in solid fraction F 0. The energy efficiency, defined as the ratio to dissipated energy of elastic energy in each <b>grain</b> before its <b>breakage,</b> is strongly correlated {{to the importance of}} the cascading effect, either through the quantity of kinetic energy released in the system, or through the capacity to capture it back in the form of elastic energy without dissipation. It ranges from 1 % to 15 % in the simulation, an order of magnitude compatible with the efficiency claimed in the industrial processes. Energy efficiency is mainly determined, by order of decreasing importance, by ?S, F 0, distribution width and choice of rupture criterion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Granular soils can {{be found}} in natural slope, {{foundation}} base and embankments. It is subjected to static and dynamics loads and the loads can cause particle breakage. Particle breakage is a phenomenon where the soil particles transform to finer state due to slippage, dilation and creep. Particle breakage can affect the stress-strain curve and this is the main focus in this study. The behaviour of stress-strain curve is no more typical if particle breakage commence. The results of consolidation isotropically drained triaxial test of coarse grain sands are presented in this study. The aim of this research is to study on how particle breakage affects the stress-strain curve. The specimens are made of quartz sand with grain size 0. 6 mm, 1. 18 mm and 2 mm. There are 15 specimens presented with confining pressures 50 kPa, lOOkPa, 200 kPa, 300 kPa and 400 kPa are applied for each <b>grain</b> size. The <b>breakage</b> is detected using microphone and the sound recorded is analysed via Sony Sound Forge software. Moreover, dry sieve analysis is conducted before and after the test in order to justify whether breakage occur during shearing stage. From the results obtained, {{it can be seen that}} particle breakage has shifted the axial strain at failure. The peak strength at failure always coincide at the same axial strain but particle breakage cause the peak strength to shift to the right with increasing confining pressure. The effect on the Mohr circle shows that particle breakage causes the failure envelope to be curved at high pressure. Normally the test with no particle breakage results a straight failure envelope. The effect of particle breakage to strength is it will increase the deviator stress until a certain point which is abnormally higher than usual. Furthermore, the dense sand will exhibit behaviour like loose sand as the peak strength doesn't appear in stress-strain curve. It is because the effect of dilation is diminished while excessive breakage occurs...|$|R
