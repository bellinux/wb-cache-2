40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} {{an experiment in}} satellite radio-wave probing of the ionosphere, modified by powerful waves from the HF heating facility at Tromsø (Norway) in May 1995. Amplitude scintillations and variations of the phase of VHF signals from Russian navigational satellites passing over the heated region were observed. We show that both large-scale electron density irregularities (several tens of kilometers in size) and small-scale ones (from hundreds of meters to kilometers) can be generated by the HF radiation. Maximum effects caused by small-scale irregularities detected in the satellite signals are observed in the directions sector approximately parallel to the geomagnetic field lines although large-scale structures can be detected within a much larger area. The properties of small-scale irregularities (electron density fluctuations) are investigated by applying a statistical analysis and by studying experimental and model mean values of the logarithm of the relative amplitude of the signal.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the ultrasonic irradiation on the hydrolysis of magnesium hydride to enhance hydrogen generation; {{the effects of}} the ultrasonic frequency and the sample size on the hydrogen generation were mainly examined. In the experiments, three MgH 2 particle and nanofiber samples were soaked in distilled water and ultrasonically irradiated at frequencies of 28, 45, and 100 kHz. Then, the amount of hydrogen generated was measured. We found that the low frequency of ultrasonic irradiation and the relatively small sample size accelerated the hydrolysis reaction MgH 2 + 2 H(2) O = Mg(OH) (2) + 2 H(2) + 277 kJ. In particular, the MgH 2 nanofibers exhibited the maximum hydrogen storage capacity of 14. 4 mass% at room temperature at a frequency of 28 kHz (ultrasound irradiation). The results also experimentally validated that a combination of ultrasonic irradiation and MgH 2 hydrolysis is considerably effective for efficiently generating hydrogen without <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>adding</b> any agent.

25|$|The {{first law}} is usually {{formulated}} {{by saying that}} the change in the internal energy of a closed thermodynamic system is equal to the difference between the heat supplied to the system and the amount of work done by the system on its surroundings.

40|$|Plants, {{in common}} with all organisms, have evolved {{mechanisms}} {{to cope with the}} problems caused by high temperatures. We examined specifically the involvement of calcium, abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and salicylic acid (SA) in the protection against heat-induced oxidative damage in Arabidopsis. Heat caused increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels (an indicator of oxidative damage to membranes) and reduced survival. Both effects required light and were reduced in plants that had acquired thermotolerance through a mild heat pretreatment. Calcium channel blockers and calmodulin inhibitors increased these effects of <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>added</b> calcium reversed them, implying that protection against heat-induced oxidative damage in Arabidopsis requires calcium and calmodulin. Similar to calcium, SA, 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (a precursor to ethylene), <b>and</b> ABA <b>added</b> to plants protected them from heat-induced oxidative damage. In addition, the ethylene-insensitive mutant etr- 1, the ABA-insensitive mutant abi- 1, and a transgenic line expressing nahG (consequently inhibited in SA production) showed increased susceptibility to heat. These data suggest that protection against heat-induced oxidative damage in Arabidopsis also involves ethylene, ABA, and SA. Real time measurements of cytosolic calcium levels during heating in Arabidopsis detected no increases in response to heat per se, but showed transient elevations in response to recovery from heating. The magnitude of these calcium peaks was greater in thermotolerant plants, implying that these calcium signals might play a role in mediating the effects of acquired thermotolerance. Calcium channel blockers <b>and</b> calmodulin inhibitors <b>added</b> solely during the recovery phase suggest that this role for calcium is in protecting against oxidative damage specifically during/after recovery...|$|R

5000|$|Animal glue, {{especially}} hide glue, was {{the primary}} adhesive of choice for a great many types of woodworking, including furniture and lutherie, for many centuries. It is manufactured from rendered collagen from the skins (hides) of animals. It is chemically similar to edible gelatin and is non-toxic if ingested. Hide glue is still used today in specialized applications: musical instruments (lutherie), for replica furniture, and for conservation-grade repairs to antique woodwork. Hide glue is measured {{on the basis of}} its gel strength, a measure of how many grams of force it requires to depress a 1/2 in plunger 4 mm into a 12.5% protein solution of the glue at 10 C. Glue is manufactured in standard grades from 32 - 512 g. 192 g strength is the most commonly used for woodworking; 251 g is the highest normally used for instrument building; 135 g is the lowest used for general woodwork. Glue above 250 g strength requires excessive dilution and so leaves too little glue in joints for effective adhesion, so it is not commonly used. Liquid versions of hide glue are now available; typically they have urea added to keep the glue liquid at room temperature and to extend drying time. Examples of liquid hide glue are Old Brown Glue or Titebond Liquid Hide. Hide glue does not creep. Hide glue joints are easy to repair, by just <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>adding</b> more hide glue.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} intercoolers, it is common practice to add extra fuel to the intake air (known as [...] "running an engine rich") {{for the sole purpose of}} cooling. The amount of extra fuel varies, but typically reduces the air-fuel ratio to between 11 and 13, instead of the stoichiometric 14.7 (in petrol engines). The extra fuel is not burned (as there is insufficient oxygen to complete the chemical reaction), instead it undergoes a phase change from atomized (liquid) to gas. This phase change absorbs <b>heat,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>added</b> mass of the extra fuel reduces the average thermal energy of the charge and exhaust gas. Even when a catalytic converter is used, the practice of running an engine rich increases exhaust emissions.|$|R

He {{made several}} {{structural}} alterations, creating a reading room, improving the lighting <b>and</b> <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>adding</b> a hot water system. More significantly, {{in light of}} the sum of £200 to be spent on books annually, which Acland considered insufficient, he set out a detailed proposal to bring the Library under the leadership of the University. In 1856, he laid out his plan to the Trustees, at which point the Library contained between 14,000 and 15,000 volumes: [...] "fear the Library be found wanting in some standard work of reference or the ordinary Scientific Literature... while it is supposed by visitors... that the great collection of scientific works in Oxford {{is to be found in}} the Radcliffe Library... the Bodleian Library is far richer in scientific transactions and periodicals; it receives, or ought to receive, without cost all British books... the Radcliffe Library must be accounted to be, and will remain, of much less public utility than is generally supposed." [...] The Radcliffe Library building was to become a reading room of the Bodleian, and the collection transferred to the new 'Museum Library' being constructed (now the Radcliffe Science Library). The plan was accepted by both parties and on 23 October 1861 the keys to the Radcliffe Library building were handed to Bodley's Librarian. It took four more years to finalise everything. The Radcliffe Library building thus became the Radcliffe Camera as the Library ceased to be fully independent. The Trustees retained the freehold to the building, which was finally transferred to the University in 1927.|$|R
