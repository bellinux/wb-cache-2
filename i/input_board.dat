40|$|This {{paper will}} give an {{overview}} of the digital control laboratory developed at the University of Illinois Urbana/Champaign. First the laboratory equipment used in the experiments will be discussed. Specifically, the TI DSP system that was developed around the C 3 x DSK will be detailed. The DSP system uses the C 3 x DSK as a motherboard and in-house built daughter cards are used to give the system its I/O capability. Four daughter cards were built: 1) 16 K- 256 K external zero wait-state SRAM board, 2) LCD display controller board with additional 16 lines of TTL digital input and 16 lines of TTL digital output, 3) 4 channel ± 10 V DAC / 4 channel optical encoder <b>input</b> <b>board,</b> 4) 4 channel ± 10 V ADC board.

40|$|The SolarTrak{trademark} array {{tracking}} controller, {{originally developed}} and licensed by Sandia National Laboratories as a low-cost, high-accuracy, reliable controller for photovoltaic (PV) concentrator arrays, has undergone significant development to make tracking accessible {{to a much}} broader segment of the PV market. Hardware and software improvements (1) reduce power consumption for PV/battery- powered applications, (2) enable the controller to connect directly with low-cost, off-the-shelf, television satellite dish actuators, (3) enable on-site setup without an additional <b>input</b> <b>board,</b> (4) increase clock accuracy by providing daily and weekly adjustments to the on board clock, and (5) include a low-cost wind stow sensor. The result is a stand-alone tracking system sufficiently low cost and reliable to make 1 -kW tracking systems practical for flat plate and concentrating arrays. Results of a year of testing are presented showing clock accuracy better than a minute per year can be maintained...|$|E
30|$|A LabVIEW {{software}} controls spinning and translating the specimen, sets the furnace temperature through the thermocontroller, controls a direct current {{source for the}} solenoid coil, and obtains the signal from the fluxgate sensor. A digital input/output board CONTEC PIO 32 / 32 F(PCI), installed in a PCI bus of a personal computer, sends on/off signals to the spinning and translating motors, the solenoid coil, and a blower, whereas it receives signals from the photo-interrupters monitoring the position and angle of a specimen. The thermocontroller is operated through an RS 232 C port, and the current source is connected to a USB port. An analog <b>input</b> <b>board,</b> INTERFACE PCI- 3135, picks up the output voltage {{in the range of}} ± 10  V from the fluxgate sensor and converts it into a 16 -bit digital signal. Driver softwares that enable LabVIEW to communicate with the digital or analog boards are available from the respective manufacturer.|$|E

40|$|A set of {{experiments}} was designed at MIT's Man-Vehicle Laboratory {{in order to}} evaluate the effects of zero gravity on the human orientation system. During many of these experiments, {{the movements of the}} eyes are recorded on high quality video cassettes. The images must be analyzed off-line to calculate the position of the eyes at every moment in time. To this aim, I have implemented a simple inexpensive computerized system which measures the angle of rotation of the eye from digitized video images. The system is implemented on a desktop Macintosh computer, processes one play-back frame per second and exhibits adequate levels of accuracy and precision. The system uses LabVIEW, a digital output board, and a video <b>input</b> <b>board</b> to control a VCR, digitize video images, analyze them, and provide a user friendly interface for the various phases of the process. The system uses the Concept Vi LabVIEW library (Graftek's Image, Meudon la Foret, France) for image grabbing and displaying as well as translation to and from LabVIEW arrays. Graftek's software layer drives an Image Grabber board from Neotech (Eastleigh, United Kingdom). A Colour Adapter box from Neotech provides adequate video signal synchronization. The system also requires a LabVIEW driven digital output board (MacADIOS II from GW Instruments, Cambridge, MA) controlling a slightly modified VCR remote control used mainly to advance the video tape frame by frame...|$|E
40|$|Modern piloted flight {{simulators}} require detailed {{models of}} many aircraft components, {{such as the}} airframe, propulsion system, flight deck controls and instrumentation, as well as motion drive and visual display systems. The amount of computing power necessary to implement these systems can exceed that offered by dedicated mainframe computers. One approach to this problem is {{through the use of}} distributed computing, where parts of the simulation are assigned to computing subsystems, such as microcomputers. One such subsystem, such as microcomputers. One such subsystem, a real-time, portable, microcomputer-based jet engine simulator, is described in this paper. The simulator will be used at the NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator facility to perform calculations previously done on the facility's mainframe computer. The mainframe will continue to do all other system calculations and will interface to the engine simulator through analog I/ 0. The engine simulator hardware includes a 16 -bit microcomputer and floating-point coprocessor. There is an 8 channel analog <b>input</b> <b>board</b> and an 8 channel analog output board. A model of a small turboshaft engine/control is coded in floating-point FORTRAN. The FORTRAN code and a data monitoring program run under the control of an assembly language real-time executive. The monitoring program allows the user to isplay and/or modify simulator variables on-line through a data terminal. A dual disk drive system is used for mass storage of programs and data. The CP/M- 86 operating system provides file management and overall system control. The frame time for the simulator is 30 milliseconds, which includes all analog I/ 0 operations...|$|E
40|$|To {{reach the}} {{millimeter}} {{satellite laser ranging}} accuracy the Portable- Pico Event Timer [1, 2] has been upgraded in 2002. The main objectives of the upgrade were to achieve a timing jitter below 3 psec, to decrease the temperature and temporal drift of an entire device and to enable {{the operation of the}} Portable Calibration Standard based on an upgraded P-PET at the stations equipped with the multi kHz lasers. Within the upgrade, the P-PET has been equipped with the recent models of the Thales (Dassault) timing and frequency synthesis modules providing timing resolution of 1. 2 psec with the timing jitter below 2. 5 psec per channel. The new <b>input</b> <b>board</b> has been constructed, providing the advanced gating and arming options. This upgrade, together with the built in software modifications, gives to P-PET the possibility to cooperate with the high repetition rate laser ranging systems. The maximum rate is 100 P-PET measurements per second. If the laser system under test is operating at repetition rate higher than 100 Hz, the P-PET samples the measurements with the repetition rate of 100 measurements per second. The repetition rate of the laser system under test may be as high as 2 MHz. The timing linearity self test option has been included into the P-PET. In the self test operation mode, the lowest 12 bits of the epoch (corresponding to the interval 0 - 5 nsec) is output from both the timing modules. The dependence of the measured interval in the “cable ranging test ” on the reading of one of the timing modules gives an estimate of the timing modules linearity within the 5 nsec window. The master clock frequency of the timing modules is 200 MHz, thus the 5 nsec window is of the main concern for linearity. The non-linearity has been measured to be 2. 8 psec...|$|E

The technology provided an application programming interface that allowed Windows software developers to add the ability to play or manipulate digital video to their own applications. Lastly, it included a suite of software for playing and manipulating digital video.|$|R

40|$|The highly {{parallel}} 2 D-clustering FPGA implementation {{used for}} the input system of Fast TracKer (FTK) processor for the ATLAS experiment at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is presented. The LHC after the 2013 - 2014 shutdown periods {{is expected to increase}} the luminosity, which will make more difficult to have efficient online selection of rare events due to the increasing of the overlapping collisions.

40|$|A heavily {{instrumented}} and unoccupied research {{house is}} used to continuously monitor the temperature in each room, the supply and return ducts, HVAC thermostat location, attic and outdoors. Simultaneous measurements of the differential pressures have been performed across the house walls, indoorfattic zones, the house slab and the indoor zones. Indoor radon concentrations and meteorological conditions have also been monitored. Temperature measurements were conducted using thermocouple wires. All data were collected by computer-controlled data acquisition <b>input</b> <b>boards.</b> An analytical model was developed based on a linear approximation to the weakly exponentially dependent pressures between two temperature zones under hydrostatic equilibrium. The model is utilized to predict the temperature-induced pressure difference between two separated temperature zones. This model is then coupled with a semi-empirical formulation that utilizes pressure differences to predict radon entry into the structure and the air exchange rate across the house shell. The partial contributions of various temperatureinduced pressure differences are assessed on the model driving parameters. The contribution to the indoor radon concentrations are then obtained by incorporating the predicted changes in pressure differentials into the mass balance equation governing the time rate changes of the radon concentrations. It has been demonstrated that temperature differences associated with extreme weather conditions can generate pressure differences of several pascals that profoundly contribute to radon driving forces and indoor radon concentrations. The partial contributions of temperaturedriven radon entry rates and ventilation rates {{for a range of}} HVAC operation were also estimated...|$|R

40|$|Governance theory {{predicts that}} board composition, board size, diversity, and CEO duality {{will have a}} direct effect on {{organizational}} effectiveness. Nevertheless, previous empirical research has found equivocal results when testing these relationships. In addition, governance theorists have suggested that board process is an important determinant of organizational effectiveness, but rarely have process data been examined in the empirical research on boards of directors. Board decision making process has not been developed adequately nor tested, so that {{little is known about}} the specific dimensions of board decision making process and its affect on performance. This study develops a model of board influence on organizational effectiveness which details two types of intervening variables: activity and the exchange context. The primary activity of the board is strategic decision making and evaluation. The exchange context is developed by integrating a review of the decision making and groups literatures. The exchange context is comprised of interaction, information sharing, discussion style, and participation. A test of the model demonstrated direct positive relationships between the exchange context and organizational effectiveness. In addition, some tests demonstrated that the exchange context moderated the relationship between <b>board</b> <b>input</b> variables and organizational effectiveness. Thus, in addition to developing dimensions of board decision making process, the empirical results in this project provide some explanation for previous equivocal results in testing the relationships between <b>board</b> <b>input</b> variables and organizational effectiveness. ...|$|R
