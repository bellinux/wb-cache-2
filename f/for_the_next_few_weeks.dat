The single-disc edition also charted separately, {{reaching}} a peak of number 91. In Australia, the soundtrack debuted on the ARIA Charts at number six. After fluctuating down the charts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> it climbed into the top-ten in March 1997, and peaked at number five. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) certified the two-disc edition as gold and the singe-disc edition as platinum for shipment of 35,000 and 70,000 copies respectively.

5|$|The Flyers {{hosted a}} {{practice}} {{game against the}} Muncie Tigers on September 26, 1920, but {{the result of the}} game is unknown. The Flyers' first game of the season was against the Rock Island Independents. The Independents beat the Flyers 45–0. As a result, the Staleys, who were supposed to play the Flyers the next week, cancelled because they wanted to play a better team. The Flyers tried to schedule game <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> but were unsuccessful. Since there were no rules to keep players on teams, several Flyers' players left and played for other teams. The Flyers scheduled a game against the Cleveland Tigers three weeks later, but the game was cancelled because the Tigers decided to play against the Panhandles instead. The same result happened next week against the Dayton Triangles. The Flyers were challenged by the Gas City Tigers and Muncie Offers More AC—two teams of Muncie. These games are not counted in the APFA standings.|$|E

As they were not trained for direct combat, they were kept from direct engagement with the Germans. Bouck earned the Combat Infantryman Badge during this period. The platoon consisted of two nine-man reconnaissance squads and a seven-man headquarters section who worked in the 394th regimental S2 section. Their mission was to conduct reconnaissance up to and through the German lines, including missions to capture German soldiers, to obtain intelligence about the enemy forces' disposition.|$|E

25|$|Diana {{first met}} Charles, Prince of Wales, {{when she was}} 16 in November 1977; he was dating her older sister, Lady Sarah. They were guests at a country weekend {{during the summer of}} 1980 when she watched him play polo and he took a serious {{interest}} in Diana as a potential bride. The relationship progressed when he invited her for a sailing weekend to Cowes aboard the royal yacht Britannia. This was followed by an invitation to Balmoral (the Royal Family's Scottish residence) to meet his family one weekend in November 1980. Lady Diana was well received by the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Charles subsequently courted Diana in London.

25|$|Operation Coronado IX was a {{riverine}} {{military operation}} {{conducted by the}} Mobile Riverine Force of the United States and elements of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam from November 1967 to January 1968 {{in an attempt to}} dismantle communist strongholds in the Mekong Delta. In the middle of November, clashes resulted in the capture of communist supplies and hideouts. During this period, the communists lost 178 men but killed only 26. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> there was little contact, although some abandoned communist bunkers were destroyed and supplies captured. On 4 December, large engagement occurred when a communist battalion encountered a battalion of South Vietnamese marines. There were 266 Vietcong killed, mostly by South Vietnamese marines. The South Vietnamese Marines lost 40 killed, while the Americans suffered 9 dead. Over the next month and the Christmas period, there was only sproadic skirmishes, but {{at the start of the}} new year, there were some medium size battles in which the Americans killed a few dozen communists. After this there was little contact.|$|E
25|$|In early April 1943, sixteen {{months after}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941 and the {{subsequent}} German declaration of war on the United States, four days later, which brought the United States into World War II, the 36th Division, commanded by Major General Fred L. Walker, a distinguished World War I veteran, was shipped from New York Harbor to Oran, Algeria, and was then stationed in Rabat in Morocco. The division, originally slated to participate in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, although in the event never used, was kept in reserve until September 9, when it landed on Red Beach near the ancient city of Paestum in the Campania region of Italy as part of Operation Avalanche, the Allied invasion of Italy. The 36th Division {{was part of the}} U.S. Fifth Army. Waskow saw combat {{for the first time in}} the struggle to hold and enlarge the Salerno beachhead and for the Chiunzi Pass, where he commanded Company 'B'. His brother August was wounded during the battle and sent home. The 36th Division sustained very heavy casualties in the battle, and was held in Fifth Army reserve <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> absorbing replacements and training for future combat operations.|$|E

25|$|The 4th Division, {{suffering}} {{heavy losses}} in Tunisia, was rested for the Sicilian campaign but in late August Hawkesworth {{took over as}} GOC of the 46th Infantry Division, a Territorial Army (TA) formation that had seen service in Tunisia alongside his 4th Division, after the division's former GOC, Major General Harold Freeman-Attwood was relieved and arrested for a security violation. The 46th Division {{took part in the}} Allied invasion of Italy on 9 September as part of the British X Corps, under Lieutenant General Richard McCreery, then serving under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark's US Fifth Army and, repelling numerous fierce counterattacks, suffered very heavy casualties (including Hawkesworth's senior brigade commander, Brigadier M. A. James of the 128th (Hampshire) Brigade). After the capture of Naples in early October the division crossed the Volturno Line, with X Corps forming the left flank of the Fifth Army's advance to the Winter Line (also known as the Gustav Line). During the First Battle of Monte Cassino in January 1944 the division made an assault crossing of the Garigliano river. Lack of assault boats and heavy German resistance condemned it to failure, with heavy losses, mainly to the 128th (Hampshire) Brigade. The 46th Division's failure was to have serious repercussions for the US 36th (Texas) Division, {{to the right of the}} 46th, when it attempted to cross the Rapido River a few days later. After holding the line <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> in March the division was relieved by Hawkesworth's old command, the 4th Division (now commanded by Major General Dudley Ward), and withdrawn to Egypt and Palestine to rest and refit, having sustained more than 5,000 casualties since landing at Salerno some six months prior.|$|E

It was a short-lived marriage, however, because on 18 August 1885 Maria died of tuberculosis.|$|E
500|$|The {{troops of}} the 99th Infantry Division, who lacked battle experience, were {{deployed}} to the Ardennes in November 1944, with the 394th Regiment relieving the 60th Regiment of the 9th Infantry Division. Among the units was the 394th I platoon consisting of well-trained soldiers, who had been selected because they were expert marksmen and in peak physical condition. Some {{of the men were}} college-educated and were former members of the U.S. Army's abruptly terminated ASTP program. This platoon was led by 20-year-old Lt. Lyle Bouck, one of the youngest officers in the Army, and the second youngest man in the unit. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> his platoon [...] established and maintained regimental listening and observation posts, conducted patrols behind enemy lines, and gathered information.

The brigade marched the [...] in nine days, arrived on the 25 April and came under command of the Imperial Mounted Division. The division was the army reserve under orders to counter-attack the Turkish left flank. The expected attack never came, but instead of moving back to the canal, the brigade became lines of communication troops, based at Khan Yunis and Rafah. For the next three months, the brigade was deployed on rear area security and patrolling duties. In May 1917, the cavalry regiments received the Vickers machine-gun to replace their older Maxim Guns and all ranks were put through training courses on the Vickers and a newer version of the Lee–Enfield Rifle, which had also just been issued. In September, the cavalry regiments' pack horses started {{to be replaced by}} horse-drawn wagons and each of the regiments was issued with twelve Hotchkiss machine-guns; one per troop.|$|E

[...] On 19October, Lim told Lau that a ghost was haunting her, but he could exorcise it with his sex rituals. [...] She was unconvinced, but the medium persisted.
