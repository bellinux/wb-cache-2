None of the fish fillet samples had PFOA levels above the limit of detection (0.27 μg/kg); however, PFOS concentrations of 8.2 to 225 μg/kg fresh weight were measured in fish from densely populated regions. With regard to the TDI of 150 μg/kg BW/day [15] and assuming the consumption of fish on a regular basis, the PFC concentrations in 33 of the 112 fish examined represent a potential health risk to heavy consumers of fish [27].|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} {{for this}} study was to evaluate the influence of preindustrial and expected future atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (280 µatm and 700 µatm pCO 2, respectively) on different life-cycle stages of the kelp Laminaria hyperborea from Helgoland (<b>Germany,</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea).</b> Zoospore germination, gametogenesis, vegetative growth, sorus formation and photosynthetic performance of vegetative and fertile tissue were examined. The contribution of external carbonic anhydrase (exCA) to C-supply for net-photosynthesis (net-PS) and the Chla- and phlorotannin content were investigated. Female gametogenesis and vegetative growth of sporophytes were significantly enhanced under the expected future pCO 2. rETR(max) and net-PS of young vegetative sporophytes tended to increase performance at higher pCO 2. The trend towards elevated net-PS vanished after inhibition of exCA. In vegetative sporophytes, phlorotannin content and Chla content were not significantly affected by pCO 2...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{intertidal}} macrophyte vegetation of {{the island}} of Helgoland (<b>Germany,</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea)</b> was recently mapped by applying the biotope concept developed by Connor and co-workers in the UK. Having defined the biotopes {{in the field and}} having developed a geographical information system, this is a useful method to do regular surveys of the area in order to record the spatial spread of relevant communities on a higher hierarchical level. Additionally, hyperspectral remote sensing methods were applied for the same area in order to develop a tool to receive synoptic spatial data of the whole area including inaccessible sites. This method is promising to detect the patchiness and spatial change of dominant intertidal macrophytes, but the method needs further development. Either of both approaches will be useful to complement the monitoring demands required for the EU WFD...|$|E

40|$|Hyperspectral {{airborne}} {{remote sensing}} provides time-efficient and high resolution data for middle-scale areas. Using the {{hyperspectral imaging sensor}} AISA Eagle attached to a motor-glider we observed the seasonal development of rocky intertidal macroalgal assemblages at the island of Helgoland (<b>Germany,</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea).</b> The image analysis consists of radiometric and geometric correction, and image data reduction, implemented by Minimum Noise Fraction and Pixel Purity Index. Parallel field spectroscopy during flight campaigns is used for atmospheric correction. Field spectroscopy was used to build a spectral library for supervised classification. The classification results were compared with intensive ground mapping for verification. The major challenge of the classification is to distinguish different algal species or genera and mixtures of them which are abundantly present in natural assemblages based on their spectral reflectance. Our results from field spectroscopy of dominant brown algae of the order Fucales and Laminariales indicate that species of the same genus are indistinguishable while differentiation between brown algal genera (Fucus, Sargassum, Laminaria) is possible. We present an approach that uses a Gaussian Mixture Model as probabilistic classifier based on the spectral peak ratios of selected wavelengths...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the concern}} about {{potential}} effects on marine pile driving, the industry is developing silent marine pile driving concepts. One of the new concepts, which has been engineered by IHC Hydrohammer in the Netherlands, is {{the application of a}} steel Noise Mitigation Screen (NMS) around the pile with the option of an additional confined air bubble layer. Initially, this mitigation measure was tested on a relatively small scale in shallow water (6 - 7 m depth), see [1]. The first results looked promising. In October 2011, IHC Hydrohammer and TNO tested a full-scale NMS in deeper water (25 m) during the pile driving of the foundations of two new meteo-masts (MM) with an IHC S- 800 hammer (maximal blow energy: 800 kJ). Geometrical properties of the piles can be found in table 1. The two identical masts were installed at two different locations. One in <b>Germany,</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> Ost (MM-NO), and one in the Netherlands, off the IJmuiden shore (MM-IJM). At MM-IJM measurement were conducted during the complete piling process. At MM-NO, measurements were conducted during restrikes on a pile which had been installed several weeks earlier, at almost the required penetration. The objective of the measurements was to assess the acoustic insertion loss of the NMS in dB as a function of frequency in 1 / 3 octave bands. Further, the Sound Exposure Level (SEL) per strike in dB re Pa 2 s at 750 m range from pile driving was assessed to check compliance with German legislation (160 dB SEL, see [2]) ...|$|E
40|$|Kelp forests {{represent}} a major habitat type in coastal waters worldwide and their structure and distribution {{is predicted to}} change due to global warming. Despite their ecological and economical importance, {{there is still a}} lack of reliable spatial information on their abundance and distribution. In recent years, various hydroacoustic mapping techniques for sublittoral environments evolved. However, in turbid coastal waters, such as off the island of Helgoland (<b>Germany,</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea),</b> the kelp vegetation is present in shallow water depths normally excluded from hydroacoustic surveys. In this study, single beam survey data consisting of the two seafloor parameters roughness and hardness were obtained with RoxAnn from water depth between 2 and 18 m. Our primary aim was to reliably detect the kelp forest habitat with different densities and distinguish it from other vegetated zones. Five habitat classes were identified using underwater-video and were applied for classification of acoustic signatures. Subsequently, spatial prediction maps were produced via two classification approaches: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and manual classification routine (MC). LDA was able to distinguish dense kelp forest from other habitats (i. e. mixed seaweed vegetation, sand, and barren bedrock), but no variances in kelp density. In contrast, MC also provided information on medium dense kelp distribution which is characterized by intermediate roughness and hardness values evoked by reduced kelp abundances. The prediction maps reach accordance levels of 62 % (LDA) and 68 % (MC). The presence of vegetation (kelp and mixed seaweed vegetation) was determined with higher prediction abilities of 75 % (LDA) and 76 % (MC). Since the different habitat classes reveal acoustic signatures that strongly overlap, the manual classification method was more appropriate for separating different kelp forest densities and low-lying vegetation. It became evident that the occurrence of kelp in this area is not simply linked to water depth. Moreover, this study shows that the two seafloor parameters collected with RoxAnn are suitable indicators for the discrimination of different densely vegetated seafloor habitats in shallow environments...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Due to {{the strong}} {{evidence}} of global warming and climate change at a global scale, {{there is a need}} of studies that focus on the future impacts of climate change at a smaller scale and in a more regional context. Albeit the predicted changes in climate and i. g. water and ground surface temperatures in Western Europe may be less dramatic and extreme than in Southern Europe or Eastern North America, these changes shall induce adaptations of the natural and cultural, i. g. economic environments. In the rim areas of <b>Germany's</b> <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> coast, tourism is important for the regional economy, especially during the summer season. But for Germans and potential tourists from other European countries these <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> coast tourist destinations are currently secondary destinations; primary destinations are mainly located in the Mediterranean climate of Southern Europe.
