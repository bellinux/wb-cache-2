60|$|The effect {{which this}} {{petition}} produced does not appear. Some temporary relief was perhaps obtained. But, soon after, this daring adventurer {{was engaged in}} a very dark intrigue against an exile of his own country, and placed pretty nearly in his own circumstances. A remarkable Highland story must be here briefly alluded to. Mr. Campbell of Glenure, who had been named factor for Government on the forfeited estates of Stewart of Ardshiel, was shot dead by an assassin as he passed through the wood of Lettermore, after crossing the ferry of Ballachulish. A gentleman, named James Stewart, a natural brother of Ardshiel, the forfeited person, was tried as being accessory to the murder, and condemned and executed upon very doubtful evidence; the heaviest part of which only amounted to the accused person having assisted a nephew of his own, called Allan Breck Stewart, with money to escape after the deed was done. Not satisfied with this vengeance, which was obtained in a manner little to the honour of the dispensation of justice at the time, {{the friends of the}} deceased Glenure were equally desirous to obtain possession of the person of Allan Breck Stewart, supposed to be the actual homicide. James Mhor Drummond was secretly applied to to trepan Stewart to the sea-coast, and bring him over to Britain, to almost certain death. Drummond MacGregor had kindred connections with the slain Glenure; and, besides, the MacGregors and Campbells had been friends of late, while the former clan and the Stewarts had, as we have seen, been recently at feud; lastly, Robert Oig was now in custody at Edinburgh, and James was desirous to do some service by which his brother might be saved. The joint force of these motives may, in James's estimation of right and wrong, have been some vindication for engaging in such an enterprise, although, as must be necessarily supposed, it could only be executed by treachery of a <b>gross</b> <b>description.</b> MacGregor stipulated for a license to return to England, promising to bring Allan Breck thither along with him. But the intended victim was put upon his guard by two countrymen, who suspected James's intentions towards him. He escaped from his kidnapper, after, as MacGregor alleged, robbing his portmanteau of some clothes and four snuff-boxes. Such a charge, it may be observed, could scarce have been made unless the parties had been living on a footing of intimacy, and had access to each other's baggage.|$|E

Because its feeding also involves chemosensing of food items, a copepod’s observed inability to feed on small algae may also be the result of its inability to sense this potential food. The lack of sensory mechanisms to detect small organisms at a distance implies that the sensing of small organisms must, by default, involve physical contact.

40|$|Abstract. Representing object {{shape in}} two or three {{dimensions}} has typically involved the description of the object boundary. This paper proposes a means for characterizing object structure and shape that avoids the need to fmd an explicit boundary. Rather it operates directly from the image intensity distribution in the object and its background, using operators that do indeed respond to "boundariness". It produces a sort of medial axis description that recognizes that both axis location and object width must be defined according to a tolerance proportional to the object width. The generalized axis is called the multisca/e medial axis because it is defined as a curve in scale space. It has all of the advantages of the traditional medial axis: representation of protrusions and indentations in the object, decomposition of object curvature and object width properties, the identification of visually opposite points of the object, incorporation of size constancy and orientation independence, and association of boundary shape properties with medial locations. It also has significant new advantages: it does not require a predetennination of exactly what locations are included in the object, it provides <b>gross</b> <b>descriptions</b> that are stable against image detail, and {{it can be used to}} identify subobjects and regions of boundary detail and to characterize their shape properties...|$|R

The goals of this study were to describe the histo-pathologic features of EOTRH in 17 affected horses from the United States and to increase awareness of this condition. Samples ranged from affected tooth to the entire rostral mandible and maxilla. Affected teeth exhibited cemental hyperplasia and lysis. The marked proliferation of cementum in severe cases caused bulbous enlargement of the intra-alveolar portions of affected teeth. Several teeth contained necrotic debris, bacteria, and plant material in the regions of cemental lysis. All horses exhibited dentinal lysis in at least affected tooth, and several contained necrotic debris in these regions. Endodontic disease was often present with inflammation, lysis, necrotic debris, fibrosis, and/or a thin rim of atubular mineralized tissue in the pulp cavity.

40|$|BACKGROUND Rare {{diseases}} in livestock animals are traditionally poorly diagnosed. Other than clinical description and pathological examination, {{the underlying causes}} have, for the most part, remained unknown. A single case of congenital skin fragility in cattle was observed, necropsy, histological and ultrastructural examinations were carried out and whole genome sequencing was utilized to identify the causative mutation. RESULTS A single purebred female Charolais calf with severe skin lesions was delivered full-term and died spontaneously after birth. The clinical and pathological findings exactly matched the <b>gross</b> <b>description</b> given by previous reports on epitheliogenesis imperfecta and epidermolysis bullosa (EB) in cattle. Histological and ultrastructural changes were consistent with EB junctionalis (EBJ). Genetic analysis revealed a previously unpublished ITGB 4 loss-of-function mutation; the affected calf was homozygous for a 4. 4  kb deletion involving exons 17 to 22, and the dam carried a single copy of the deletion indicating recessive inheritance. The homozygous mutant genotype did not occur in healthy controls of various breeds but some heterozygous carriers were found among Charolais cattle belonging to the affected herd.

40|$|Abstract Background A novel {{descriptor}} (Complex Correlation Measure (CCM)) {{for measuring}} the variability in the temporal structure of Poincaré plot has been developed to characterize or distinguish between Poincaré plots with similar shapes. Methods This {{study was designed to}} assess the changes in temporal structure of the Poincaré plot using CCM during atropine infusion, 70 ° head-up tilt and scopolamine administration in healthy human subjects. CCM quantifies the point-to-point variation of the signal rather than <b>gross</b> <b>description</b> of the Poincaré plot. The physiological relevance of CCM was demonstrated by comparing the changes in CCM values with autonomic perturbation during all phases of the experiment. The sensitivities of short term variability (SD 1), long term variability (SD 2) and variability in temporal structure (CCM) were analyzed by changing the temporal structure by shuffling the sequences of points of the Poincaré plot. Surrogate analysis was used to show CCM as a measure of changes in temporal structure rather than random noise and sensitivity of CCM with changes in parasympathetic activity. Results CCM was found to be most sensitive to changes in temporal structure of the Poincaré plot as compared to SD 1 and SD 2. The values of all descriptors decreased with decrease in parasympathetic activity during atropine infusion and 70 ° head-up tilt phase. In contrast, values of all descriptors increased with increase in parasympathetic activity during scopolamine administration. Conclusions The concordant reduction and enhancement in CCM values with parasympathetic activity indicates that the temporal variability of Poincaré plot is modulated by the parasympathetic activity which correlates with changes in CCM values. CCM is more sensitive than SD 1 and SD 2 to changes of parasympathetic activity. </p...|$|E

Trinta e sete (82, 3 %) pacientes apresentaram lesões no tubo digestivo. O local mais freqüente de lesões foi a boca (73, 3 %), seguido do cólon (55, 5 %). Lesões múltiplas foram identificadas em 17 (37, 7 %) casos. O diagnóstico mais prevalente foi infecção pelo citomegalovírus (35, 7 %) identificado predominantemente no cólon. Candidíasefoi mais freqüente na boca (26, 6 %) e infecção herpética no esôfago (8, 8 %). Verificou-se leucoplasiapilosa oral em 16 (35, 5 %) eneoplasias emsete (15, 5 %). Asneoplasias incluíram quatro sarcomas de Kaposi, dois Carcinomas intramucosos anais e um linfoma gástrico. Os dados do presente estudo confirmam a importância do trato {{gastrointestinal}} como sede de alterações patológicas relacionadas à AIDS. This {{study was}} designed to evaluate restropectivefy the frequency and etiology of the gastrointestinal (GI) lesions in 45 consecutive necropsies of adult patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). <b>Gross</b> <b>descriptions</b> and histological sections of the GI tract, from mouth to anus, were reviewed. The slides were H&E stained, and when necessary special stains and immunohistochemicalmethods were also employed. There were lesions in GI tract in 37 (82. 3 %) patients; the mouth was the segment mostfrequently involved (73. 3 % of the cases), followed by the colon (55. 5 %). Multiple lesions occurred in 17 (37. 7 %) cases. Cytomegalovirus caused colonic lesions in 35. 7 % of the cases. Candidiasis was observed in 26. 6 % mainly in the mouth and herpes simplex (8. 8 %) was the important agent of esophageal lesions. Oral hairy leukoplasia associated with HPV was found in 16 (35. 5 %) cases. Neoplasia was diagnosed in 7 (15. 5 %) cases: four Kaposi's sarcoma, two anal intramucosal carcinomas and one gastric lymphoma. Our data confirm the high frequency and variety of GI tract alterations in AIDS...|$|R
