5|$|In {{designing}} the 777 {{as its first}} fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system</b> also incorporates flight envelope protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, acting to prevent stalls, overspeeds, and excessively stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary. The <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system</b> is supplemented by mechanical backup.|$|E
5|$|The A320 was {{the first}} civil {{airliner}} to include a full digital fly-by-wire flight control system. At {{the time of the}} aircraft's introduction, the behaviour of the <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system</b> equipped with full flight envelope protection was a new experience for many pilots.|$|E
5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system</b> reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E
25|$|The AGC {{formed the}} basis of an {{experimental}} <b>fly-by-wire</b> (FBW) <b>system</b> installed into an F-8 Crusader to demonstrate the practicality of computer driven FBW. The AGC used in {{the first phase of the}} program was replaced with another machine in the second phase, and research done on the program led to the development of <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems</b> for the Space Shuttle. The AGC also led, albeit indirectly, to the development of <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems</b> for the generation of fighters that were being developed at the time.|$|R

50|$|The use {{of digital}} <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems</b> and relaxed static {{stability}} gave military aircraft increased manoeuvrability without sacrificing safety or flyability. Advanced tactical manoeuvres such as Pugachev's Cobra became possible.|$|R
5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Three {{independent}} {{hydraulic systems}} are {{installed on the}} 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using electric pumps. A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. A basic form of fly-by-wire facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system,</b> shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft's electronics bay.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the An-124, the An-70 design makes {{extensive}} use of titanium and composites to keep weight to a minimum and increase damage resistance. Approximately 25 percent of the airframe is made of carbon-fibre composites, which are primarily used on control surfaces and the tail assembly, while aluminium and steel alloys are used {{for the rest of}} the structure. The An-70 has a designed life of 45,000hours over 15,000flights. The prototypes had a fly-by-wire flight-control system that comprised three digital channels and six analog channels; it was expected that production aircraft would have a four-channel digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system.</b> Aircraft and system information are mainly relayed to the pilot and co-pilot via six large multi-function CRT displays, with secondary electro-mechanical instruments and head-up displays; a flight engineer position is also present on the prototypes.|$|E
5000|$|The Thales ATM (Air Traffic Management) {{solution}} is marketed {{under the name}} [...] "TopSky", previously named [...] "EuroCat". Thales supplies avionics to civil aircraft manufacturers, including <b>Fly-By-Wire</b> <b>systems,</b> cockpit systems, navigation computers, satellite communication, inflight entertainment and electrical systems.|$|R
50|$|Digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems</b> {{allow an}} {{aircraft}} {{to be designed}} with relaxed static stability. Initially used to increase the manoeuvrability of military aircraft such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, this is now being used to reduce drag on commercial airliners.|$|R
50|$|Wiring adds a {{considerable}} amount of weight to an aircraft; therefore, researchers are exploring implementing fly-by-wireless solutions. Fly-by-wireless systems are very similar to <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems,</b> however, instead of using a wired protocol for the physical layer a wireless protocol is employed.|$|R
5|$|The A330 {{shares the}} same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and A340, {{featuring}} electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead {{of a conventional}} control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, {{as well as the}} Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the flight deck, the A330 also has the <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system</b> common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents manoeuvres from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and structural limits.|$|E
5|$|The Panavia Tornado is a multirole, twin-engined {{aircraft}} {{designed to}} excel at low-level penetration of enemy defences. The mission envisaged during the Cold War was {{the delivery of}} conventional and nuclear ordnance on the invading forces of the Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe; this dictated several significant features of the design. Variable wing geometry, allowing for minimal drag during the critical low-level dash towards a well-prepared enemy, had been desired from the project's start. Advanced navigation and flight computers, including the then-innovative <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system,</b> greatly reduced the workload of the pilot during low-level flight and eased control of the aircraft. For long range bombing missions, the Tornado has a retractable refuelling probe.|$|E

5000|$|The {{main concern}} with <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems</b> is reliability. While {{traditional}} mechanical or hydraulic control systems usually fail gradually, {{the loss of}} all flight control computers could immediately render the aircraft uncontrollable. For this reason, most <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems</b> incorporate either redundant computers (triplex, quadruplex etc.), some kind of mechanical or hydraulic backup {{or a combination of}} both. A [...] "mixed" [...] control system such as the latter is not desirable and modern FBW aircraft normally avoid it by having more independent FBW channels, thereby reducing the possibility of overall failure to minuscule levels that are acceptable to the independent regulatory and safety authority responsible for aircraft design, testing and certification before operational service.|$|R
25|$|In September 2007, Airbus {{rolled out}} new design {{advances}} to {{a gathering of}} 100 representatives from existing and potential XWB customers. The A350 XWB {{is based on the}} technologies developed for Airbus A380 and includes a similar cockpit and <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems</b> layout.|$|R
50|$|Powered by four FRJ710 {{turbofan}} {{engines and}} {{making use of}} the CoandÄƒ effect. It was built to research STOL using upper surface blowing, aircraft noise reduction, <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems</b> and composite materials construction. The only example built is currently on display in Kakamigahara Aviation Museum in Gifu, Japan.|$|R
25|$|In 2015 Bombardier {{decided to}} {{redesign}} its wing, and along other development challenges it has delayed the programme by over two years. The redesign {{goal was to}} reduce its weight without altering its aerodynamic profile. The aircraft <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system</b> architecture {{is based on the}} CSeries one. Its airframe will use Aluminium-lithium alloys like the new airliner.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the Super Hornet's {{avionics}} {{and software}} had a 90% commonality {{with that of}} the F/A-18C/D fleet at the time. Differences include an up-front Touchscreen control display; a large multipurpose color liquid-crystal display; and a fuel display. The Super Hornet has a quadruplex digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system,</b> as well as a digital flight-control system that detects and corrects for battle damage. Initial production models used the APG-73 radar, later replaced by the AN/APG-79 active electronically scanned array (AESA). The AN/ASQ-228 ATFLIR (Advanced Targeting Forward Looking InfraRed), is the main electro-optical sensor and laser designator pod for the Super Hornet. The communications equipment consist of an AN/ARC-210 VHF/UHF radio and a MIDS-JTRS low volume terminal for HAVE QUICK, SINCGARS and Link 16 connectivity.|$|E
25|$|Early on, IAI {{decided to}} adopt a delta wing configuration, of which the company was already {{familiar}} with through its work on the earlier Kfir, which was paired with large, steerable canards situated forward of the wing. The delta wing arrangement was relatively low-weight, provided space for considerable fuel capacity, a smooth low-altitude fight attitude, {{and high levels of}} directional stability while flown at high angles of attack (AOA). The canard generated additional lift and positive control when at high AOAs. While this configuration afforded excellent maneuverability, it also exhibited natural instability during flight. To compensate, the Lavi was fitted with a sophisticated digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system</b> which allowed the aircraft {{to take advantage of this}} particular wing design while eliminating this shortcoming. The Lavi was one of the first aircraft to feature this type of configuration, which has since become more commonplace amongst fighter aircraft.|$|E
50|$|It has quadruple-redundant {{fly-by-wire}} flight controls. To lower development costs, the avionics, <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems,</b> {{and other}} parts were derived from the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle. The parts were originally described as spares on budgets for these aircraft, to keep the F-117 project secret.|$|R
40|$|Using the ultra-reliable Apollo Guidance Computer {{that enabled}} the Apollo Moon missions, Dryden Flight Research Center engineers, in {{partnership}} with industry leaders such as Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Draper Laboratory, demonstrated that digital computers {{could be used to}} fly aircraft. Digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems</b> have since been incorporated into large airliners, military jets, revolutionary new aircraft, and even cars and submarines...|$|R

25|$|One key {{innovation}} of the rotorcraft is the four-channel fly-by-wire {{control system}} employed; the NH90 {{is the first}} helicopter {{in the world to}} be equipped with full fly-by-wire flight controls. A four-axis autopilot is also integrated with the <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system,</b> as are mission and navigation systems to enable greater autonomy during operations and to reduce pilot workload. The flight envelope of the NH90 is capable of all-weather day-and-night operations, ship-borne operations during high sea states, across a temperature range from âˆ’40Â°C to +50Â°C, and up to a maximum altitude of 20,000 feet. Power is provided by a pair of turboshaft engines, dependent on customer selection, the NH90 is either fitted with Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 or General Electric T700E powerplants; exhaust gases from the engines are filtered through an infrared suppression system for decreased sensory visibility. According to Airbus Helicopters, the NH90 possesses the lowest radar signature in its class, principally due to its diamond-shaped composite fuselage.|$|E
500|$|The primary flight {{controls}} {{are compatible with}} the Hands On Throttle-And-Stick (HOTAS) control principleâ€“ the centrally mounted stick, in addition to flying the aircraft, also controls the cockpit displays and weapon systems. A triplex, digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system</b> is employed on the Gripen's {{flight controls}}, with a mechanical backup for the throttle. Additional functions, such as communications, navigational and decision support data, can be accessed via the up front control panel, directly above the central cockpit display. The Gripen includes the EP-17 cockpit display system, developed by Saab to provide pilots {{with a high level}} of situational awareness and reduces pilot workload through intelligent information management. [...] The Gripen features a sensor fusion capability, information from onboard sensors and databases is combined, automatically analysed, and useful data is presented to the pilot via a wide field-of-view head-up display, three large multi-function colour displays, and optionally a helmet mounted display system (HMDS).|$|E
500|$|The Arrow's thin wing {{required}} aviation's first [...] {{hydraulic system}} to supply enough {{force to the}} control surfaces, while using small actuators and piping. A rudimentary <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system</b> was employed, in which the pilot's input was detected {{by a series of}} pressure-sensitive transducers in the stick, and their signal was sent to an electronic control servo that operated the valves in the hydraulic system to move the various flight controls. This resulted in a lack of control feel; because the control stick input was not mechanically connected to the hydraulic system, the variations in back-pressure from the flight control surfaces that would normally be felt by the pilot could no longer be transmitted back into the stick. To re-create a sense of feel, the same electronic control box rapidly responded to the hydraulic back-pressure fluctuations and triggered actuators in the stick, making it move slightly; this system, called [...] "artificial feel", was also a first.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, the top {{concern for}} computerized, digital, <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems</b> is reliability, {{even more so}} than for analog {{electronic}} control systems. This is because the digital computers that are running software are often the only control path between the pilot and aircraft's flight control surfaces. If the computer software crashes for any reason, the pilot may be unable to control an aircraft. Hence virtually all <b>fly-by-wire</b> flight control <b>systems</b> are either triply or quadruply redundant in their computers and electronics. These have three or four flight-control computers operating in parallel, and three or four separate data buses connecting them with each control surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was reportedly designed with extra stability {{and so does}} not need a <b>fly-by-wire</b> (FBW) <b>system.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly common in civil transport aircraft due to the economic and technological benefits that this technology provides. These <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems</b> are comprised of two major components; the flight control laws, which govern the aircraftâ€™s handling characteristics, and the flight control system architecture, or the hardware, {{which is used to}} implement the control laws. This report will primarily consider the design of the flight control hardware, although control laws will be briefly examined for current civil fly-by-wire aircraft. The background to the architecture is presented, along with relevant issues such as processing distribution and the requirements for system synchronisation. The flight control systems for current civil aircraft are described in detail, and these systems are compared to detailed certification, maintenance and functional requirements. The findings of the analysis are used to propose a <b>fly-by-wire</b> flight control <b>system</b> architecture for a Generic Regional Aircraft. This architecture is not complex, only uses existing technology and meets the requirements previously determined. It has a capability for deferred maintenance sing it is shown that the aircraft can be dispatched with one flight control computer failed and still meet the mandatory reliability requirements defined by the national airworthiness authorities. Control laws are not proposed. The Universit...|$|R

2500|$|It was envisioned {{that the}} Lavi's {{lifecycle}} {{costs would be}} considerably beneath those of the F-16, efforts were also made to achieve a lower procurement cost as well. Like the F-16, the Lavi was an aerodynamically unstable aircraft, employing a quadruplex-redundant [...] digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>system</b> {{in order to provide}} stability and control; {{this was one of the}} aircraft's more innovative features.|$|E
50|$|A {{concern with}} using digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems</b> on the Shuttle was reliability. Considerable {{research}} {{went into the}} Shuttle computer system. The Shuttle used five identical redundant IBM 32-bit general purpose computers (GPCs), model AP-101, constituting a type of embedded system. Four computers ran specialized software called the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS). A fifth backup computer ran separate software called the Backup Flight System (BFS). Collectively they were called the Data Processing System (DPS).|$|R
50|$|Launched into {{production}} during 1984, the Airbus Industries Airbus A320 {{became the first}} airliner to fly with an all-digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> control <b>system.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electronic <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>systems</b> {{can respond}} {{flexibly}} to changing aerodynamic conditions, by tailoring {{flight control surface}} movements so that aircraft response to control inputs is appropriate to flight conditions. Electronic systems require less maintenance, whereas mechanical and hydraulic systems require lubrication, tension adjustments, leak checks, fluid changes, etc. Placing circuitry between pilot and aircraft can enhance safety. For example, the control system can try to prevent a stall, or it can stop the pilot from over stressing the airframe.|$|R
