5|$|Bulbs are {{harvested}} for {{market in the}} summer, sorted, stored for 2 – 3 weeks, and then further disinfected by a hot (43.5°C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes. The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5°C. The initiation of new flower <b>development</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bulb takes place in late spring before the bulbs are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage. The optimal temperature for initiation is 20°C followed by cooling to 13°C.|$|E

5|$|Copenhagen's urban <b>development</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{first half}} of the 20th century was heavily {{influenced}} by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted Fordism and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication. Copenhagen’s spacial planning in this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.|$|E

A retort builder like red-rumped swallow starts {{with an open}} cup, closes it, and then builds the entrance tunnel. Winkler and Sheldon propose {{that the development of}} closed nests reduced competition between males for copulations with the females. Since mating occurs inside the nest, the difficulty of access means other males are excluded. This reduction in competition permits the dense breeding colonies typical of the Delichon martins.|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{concerning}} {{the scope and}} nature of base <b>development</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Admiralty Islands were held in early February between representatives of SWPA and Admiral William Halsey, Jr.'s neighbouring South Pacific Area (SOPAC). The original intention was forces from SWPA would capture the islands and construct the airbase, while SOPAC {{would be responsible for}} the development of the naval base. The SOPAC representatives indicated they would not be able to supply troops or materials in the early stages, so it was resolved SWPA would also undertake the initial stages of naval base development.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, {{aircraft}} development became increasingly expensive, resulting in major projects often becoming mired in {{political and economic}} concerns. The development of TSR-2 saw increasing cost overruns, combined {{with the presence of}} a potentially cheaper alternative then under <b>development</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, the F-111. The P.1154 was subject to the ongoing inter-service rivalry between the Royal Navy and RAF, which led to two wildly differing specifications being submitted for the aircraft that were impossible to fulfill with a single airframe.|$|E

Tropical Storm Allison's <b>development</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico was partially related to residual conditions from Cosme's remnants.|$|E
