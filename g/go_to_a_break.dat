50|$|RedZone {{operates}} as a commercial-free service; as such, whenever a game taking primary focus <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> broadcaster-designated commercial <b>break</b> or other stoppage (such as timeout, instant replay challenge or an injury timeout), the feed will immediately switch to the next most-interesting game in-progress at the moment. Despite the network's commercial-free commitment, commercials are not completely avoided as sometimes the network coverage may take <b>a</b> <b>break</b> faster than expected, and broadcast network promotions of their programming will be shown as {{a natural part of}} the coverage.|$|R

Kip and BG appeared in an internet video on TNA's website where they addressed the owner of WWE Vince McMahon.|$|R
50|$|Mafi's first {{appearance}} in a Munster jersey came during the close, hard fought win against Leicester Tigers at Welford Road in Round 1 of the 2006-07 Heineken Cup. Mafi was only on the pitch for a few minutes, but during that time he found himself at {{the wrong end of}} a trademark hit from Fijian centre Seru Rabeni. However, Mafi's home debut in Thomond Park, in the trouncing of French outfit Bourgoin, was more impressive. Sprung from the bench with 10 minutes <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>a</b> scintillating <b>break</b> and hand-off resulted in a try for substitute hooker Andy Kyriacou.|$|R
5000|$|Directed by Melina Matsoukas, {{the music}} video was shot on September 19 and September 20, 2008.

She is dressed in a dominatrix catsuit and thigh-high black stiletto boots. Then, Ciara jumps off the desk and does an immediate split, She and her dancers perform erotic choreography on the chairs. Second, Ciara walks into an elevator. She gets in and performs erratic choreography and shows her transforming. Then, she exits the elevator. She and her dancers make robotic movements and dance routines. Shortly after, T-Pain performs his verse and dances. Ciara in a different sexy robotic costume is sitting on a motorcycle with sparks shooting from the back. Next, the music video <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dance <b>break,</b> calling all the [...] "Go Girls" [...] to the dance floor. Ciara slides down a pole and starts performing intense choreography with several dancers. The video concludes with Ciara typing [...] "Go Girl" [...] on the typewriter.|$|R
50|$|During {{the last}} heated {{argument}} between {{the father and}} the son, Hiranyakasipu asked if Vishnu was present everywhere and <b>went</b> on <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>a</b> pillar with his weapon seeking to see Vishnu in it. Vishnu, pleased by the devotion of Prahalada, took the avatar of Narasimha and came out of the opening in the pillar. Narasimha's avatar was a lion-faced human and slayed Hiranyakasipu on an evening time in a doorway, which was neither land nor air. Ages passed by, when the sages were praying Narasimha to seek his blessings. They were guided by the pretext of Vishwamitra gaining the Rajarishi title with his prayers to Narasimha.|$|R
50|$|Should {{the top two}} or more contestants {{have the}} same score and same number of passes {{at the end of}} the contest then a tie-breaker is employed, in which the contenders are each asked the same five {{questions}} (one contender answers questions, while the others must leave the studio so that they may not able to hear). It is not clear what would happen should this fail <b>to</b> produce <b>a</b> clear winner, though it is implied that the process would simply be repeated as many times as necessary (and probably unsuccessful tie-breakers would be edited out of the programme, to save time). It is, however, very rare for the tie-break to be required. In the version of the show hosted by John Humphrys (2003 to present), it has appeared only five times in the main series and once in the Junior Mastermind spin-off, the latter being in the final broadcast on 26 February 2006. In 2016, the grand final <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tie <b>break</b> for the first time in the show's history, and also for the first time in the following series, there was a three-way tie finish.|$|R

The singer wanted to take more opportunities and learn more about herself, which she often let go when in a relationship, but felt that she was in a now-or-never situation. Milian described Lyon as an amazing guy, and said that although there was a chance for the couple in the future, she needed to focus on herself.|$|R
