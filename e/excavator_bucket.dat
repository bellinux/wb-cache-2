40|$|There are {{in excess}} of 20 million acres of bomb and {{artillery}} ranges {{under the control of}} the Department of Defense (DoD). Each year some 800, 000 to 2, 000, 000 km 2 are turned over to civilian (private or commercial) use. Some of this land is contaminated with buried unexploded ordnance (UXO). These UXOs present a safety hazard and raise many environmental concerns. In addition to inaccurate locating, one of the most difficult aspects for the operator of an excavator is the inability to see the target ordnance while it is covered with soil and debris. This paper presents a system which is mounted to the arm of an excavator and is capable of detecting a buried UXO located in the path of an <b>excavator's</b> <b>bucket.</b> Also, the system is able to determine the precise location of the ordnance relative to the <b>excavator's</b> <b>bucket.</b> This information will allow the operator not only to avoid striking the ordnance during the digging operation, but also to expose the object by removing the soil around it. This technology is also capable of locating small UXO which can be buried within the spoil material. This technology has the potential to result in savings of millions of dollars in operating costs and prevent the damage or loss of equipment. ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{tiltrotator}} (known under {{a number}} of trade names) is an hydraulic attachment/tool used on most excavators, and backhoes between 3-30 tons in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland, and Norway). A tiltrotator is mounted on the excavator such that the <b>excavator</b> <b>bucket</b> can be rotated through 360 degrees and one tilts +/- 45 degrees, {{in order to increase}} the flexibility and precision of the excavator. A tiltrotator can best be described as a wrist between the arm of the excavator and bucket, (or whatever other tool is fitted to the tiltrotator's quick coupler). With its integral quick coupler and rotary swivel, the tiltrotator can also use extra hydraulic functions to power and manipulate other worktools below it such as a breaker, grapple or an auger, which can be attached to the quickcoupler on the tiltrotator, for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the excavator's utilization on the jobsite. control systems which allows the operator to operate the machine fully through the joysticks.

Traverse hardening is used extensively {{in the production of}} shaft type components such as axle shafts, <b>excavator</b> <b>bucket</b> pins, steering components, power tool shafts and drive shafts. The component is fed through a ring type inductor which normally features a single turn. The width of the turn is dictated by the traverse speed, the available power and frequency of the generator. This creates a moving band of heat which when quenched creates the hardened surface layer. The quench ring can be either integral a following arrangement or a combination of both subject to the requirements of the application. By varying speed and power it is possible to create a shaft which is hardened along its whole length or just in specific areas and also to harden shafts with steps in diameter or splines. It is normal when hardening round shafts to rotate the part during the process to ensure any variations due to concentricity of the coil and the component are removed.|$|E
