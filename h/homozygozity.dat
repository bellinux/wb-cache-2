Both were diagnosed with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) after molecular genetic analysis of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. Since heFH by itself could {{not account for the}} massive xanthomas, the presence of an additional hereditary lipid or lipoprotein disorder was suspected. Further genetic analysis revealed <b>homozygozity</b> for mutations in the sterol 27 -hydroxylase gene, confirming the diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX).

40|$|International audienceA {{recent study}} of 17 men with decapitated {{spermatozoa}} found that 8 carried two rare SUN 5 alleles, and concluded that loss of SUN 5 function causes the acephalic spermatozoa syndrome. Consistent with this, the SUN 5 protein localises to the head-tail junction in normal spermatozoa, and SUN proteins are known to form links between the cytoskeleton and the nucleus. However, six of the ten SUN 5 variants reported were missense with an unknown effect on function, and only one man carried two high confidence loss-of-function (LOF) alleles: p. Ser 284 * <b>homozygozity.</b> One potential exonic splice mutation, homozygous variant p. Gly 114 Arg, was not tested experimentally. Thus, definitive proof that loss of SUN 5 function causes the acephalic spermatozoa syndrome is still lacking. Based on these findings, we determined the sequence of the SUN 5 gene in three related men of North African origin with decapitated spermatozoa. We found all three men to be homozygous for a deletioninsertion variant (GRCh 38 - chr 20 : 329957612990672 delinsTGGT) that removes 5090 base pairs including exon 8 of SUN 5, predicting the frameshift, p. (Leu 143 Serfs* 30), and the inactivation of SUN 5. We therefore present the second case where the acephalic spermatozoa syndrome is associated with two LOF alleles of SUN 5. We also show that the p. Gly 114 Arg variant has a strong inhibitory effect on splicing in HeLa cells, evidence that <b>homozygozity</b> for p. Gly 114 Arg causes acephalic spermatozoa syndrome through loss of SUN 5 function. Our results, together {{with those of the}} previous study, show that SUN 5 is required for the formation of the sperm head-tail junction and male fertility...|$|E
40|$|Recent use of genomic (marker-based) {{relationships}} {{shows that}} relationships exist {{within and across}} base population (breeds or lines). However, current treatment of pedigree relationships is unable to consider relationships within or across base populations, although such relationships must exist due to finite size of the ancestral population and connections between populations. This complicates the conciliation of both approaches and, in particular, combining pedigree with genomic relationships. We present a coherent theoretical framework to consider base population in pedigree relationships. We suggest a conceptual framework that considers each ancestral population as a finite-sized pool of gametes. This generates across-individual relationships and contrasts with the classical view which each population is considered as an infinite, unrelated pool. Several ancestral populations may be connected and therefore related. Each ancestral population can be represented as a “metafounder,” a pseudo-individual included as founder of the pedigree and similar to an “unknown parent group. ” Metafounders have self- and across relationships according {{to a set of}} parameters, which measure ancestral relationships, i. e., <b>homozygozities</b> within populations and relationships across populations. These parameters can be estimated from existing pedigree and marker genotypes using maximum likelihood or a method based on summary statistics, for arbitrarily complex pedigrees. Equivalences of genetic variance and variance components between the classical and this new parameterization are shown. Segregation variance on crosses of populations is modeled. Efficient algorithms for computation of relationship matrices, their inverses, and inbreeding coefficients are presented. Use of metafounders leads to compatibility of genomic and pedigree relationship matrices and to simple computing algorithms. Examples and code are given...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) genetic risk factors through {{identification of a}} functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and its disease association. We chose ERCC 6 because of its roles in the aging process, DNA repair, and ocular degeneration from the gene disruption. Bioinformatics indicated a putative binding-element alteration on the sequence containing C− 6530 >G SNP in the 5 ′ flanking region of ERCC 6 from Sp 1 on the C allele to SP 1, GATA- 1, and OCT- 1 on the G allele. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays displayed distinctive C and G allele-binding patterns to nuclear proteins. Luciferase expression was higher in the vector construct containing the G allele than that containing the C allele. A cohort of 460 advanced AMD cases and 269 age-matched controls was examined along with pathologically diagnosed 57 AMD and 18 age-matched non-AMD archived cases. ERCC 6 C− 6530 >G was associated with AMD susceptibility, both independently and through interaction with an SNP (rs 380390) in the complement factor H (CFH) intron reported to be highly associated with AMD. A disease odds ratio of 23 was conferred by <b>homozygozity</b> for risk alleles at both ERCC 6 and CFH compared with <b>homozygozity</b> for nonrisk alleles. Enhanced ERCC 6 expression was observed in lymphocytes from healthy donors bearing ERCC 6 C− 6530 >G alleles. Intense immunostaining of ERCC 6 was also found in AMD eyes from ERCC 6 C− 6530 >G carriers. The strong AMD predisposition conferred by the ERCC 6 and CFH SNPs may result from biological epistasis, because ERCC 6 functions in universal transcription {{as a component of}} RNA pol I transcription complex...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGeneralized peeling skin {{syndrome}} (PSS) is an {{autosomal recessive}} genodermatosis characterized by lifelong, continuous shedding {{of the upper}} epidermis. Using whole-genome <b>homozygozity</b> mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified a novel homozygous missense mutation (c. 229 C>T, R 77 W) within the CHST 8 gene, in a large consanguineous family with non-inflammatory PSS type A. CHST 8 encodes a Golgi transmembrane N-acetylgalactosamine- 4 -O-sulfotransferase (GalNAc 4 -ST 1), which we show by immunofluorescence staining to be expressed throughout normal epidermis. A colorimetric assay for total sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, comparing human keratinocytes (CCD 1106 KERTr) expressing wild type and mutant recombinant GalNAc 4 -ST 1, revealed decreased levels of total sulfated GAGs in cells expressing mutant GalNAc 4 -ST 1, suggesting loss of function. Western blotting revealed lower expression levels of mutant recombinant GalNAc 4 -ST 1 compared to wild type, suggesting that accelerated degradation may result in loss of function, leading to PSS type A. This is the first report describing a mutation {{as the cause of}} PSS type A...|$|E

40|$|A 60 -yr-old {{woman and}} her brother, {{products}} of a consanquinous mating, were chylomicronemic. The chylomicronemia in both subjects {{was found to be}} due to the absence of functional apoCII. A mutant form, designated apoCIISt. Michael (apoCIIs), was identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blot using anti-apoCII antiserum. The isoelectric point of apoCIIs was similar to that of normal apoCII, but its apparent molecular weight was 3, 000 greater. Tryptic peptides of apoCIIs were identified that had retention times in reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and amino acid compositions indistinguishable from that of residues 1 to 48 and 51 to 55 of normal apoCII. The complete sequence of apoCIIs was deduced from a combination of the sequence analysis of tryptic peptides corresponding to residues 56 through 96 and the known sequence of the apoCII gene. ApoCIIs differed from apoCII at residue 70 where Gln 70 was replaced by Pro 70 and the sequence terminated with Pro 96. This is consistent with a base insertion in the codon for Asp 69 or Gln 70 in the apoCII gene and a subsequent translation reading frame shift. Both patients were homozygous for apoE- 4. This and the absence of normal apoCII is consistent with <b>homozygozity</b> at the apoE-CII gene locus on chromosome 19.

The goal of this study was to analyze the role of Toll-like receptor 4 polymorphisms + 896 (rs 4986790) and + 1196 (rs 4986791) in the pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori related gastroduodenal diseases in relation to gastric secretion and inflammation. Toll-like receptor 4 polymorphisms, serum gastrin- 17 and pepsinogen I and II concentrations were determined, and gastroscopies with histopathological analyses were performed to 216 dyspeptic patients. As genotype controls, 179 controls and 61 gastric cancer patients were studied. In our study, the Toll-like receptor 4 + 896 and + 1196 polymorphisms were in total linkage disequilibrium. The homozygous wild types displayed higher gastrin- 17 serum concentrations than the mutants (p = 0. 001) and this effect was independent of Helicobacter pylori. The homozygous wild types also displayed an increased risk for peptic ulcers (OR: 4. 390). Toll-like receptor 4 genotypes did not show any association with Helicobacter pylori positivity or the features of gastric inflammation. Toll-like receptor 4 expression was seen in gastrin and somatostatin expressing cells of antral mucosa by immunohistochemistry. Our results suggest a role for Toll-like receptor 4 in gastric acid regulation and that the Toll-like receptor 4 + 896 and + 1196 wild type <b>homozygozity</b> increases peptic ulcer risk via gastrin secretion...|$|E
40|$|Orofaciodigital syndromes (OFDSs) {{consist of}} a group of {{heterogeneous}} disorders characterized by abnormalities in the oral cavity, face, and digits and associated phenotypic abnormalities that lead to the delineation of 13 OFDS subtypes. Here, by a combined approach of <b>homozygozity</b> mapping and exome ciliary sequencing, we identified truncating TCTN 3 mutations as the cause of an extreme form of OFD associated with bone dysplasia, tibial defect, cystic kidneys, and brain anomalies (OFD IV, Mohr-Majewski syndrome). Analysis of 184  individuals with various ciliopathies (OFD, Meckel, Joubert, and short rib polydactyly syndromes) led us to identify four additional truncating TCTN 3 mutations in unrelated fetal cases with overlapping Meckel and OFD IV syndromes and one homozygous missense mutation in a family with Joubert syndrome. By exploring roles of TCTN 3 in human ciliary related functions, we found that TCTN 3 is necessary for transduction of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, as revealed by abnormal processing of GLI 3 in patient cells. These results are consistent with the suggested role of its murine ortholog, which forms a complex at the ciliary transition zone with TCTN 1 and TCTN 2, both of which are also implicated in the transduction of SHH signaling. Overall, our data show the involvement of the transition zone protein TCTN 3 in the regulation of the key SHH signaling pathway and that its disruption causes a severe form of ciliopathy, combining features of Meckel and OFD IV syndromes...|$|E

R 72 P associations with specific cancer risk, particularly hematological malignancies, have been conflicting. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with chromosome 5 q deletion is characterized by erythroid hypoplasia arising from lineage-specific p 53 accumulation resulting from ribosomal insufficiency. We hypothesized that apoptotically diminished R 72 P C-allele may influence predisposition to del(5 q) MDS. Bone marrow and blood DNA was sequenced from 705 MDS cases (333 del(5 q), 372 non-del(5 q)) and 157 controls. Genotype distribution did not significantly differ between del(5 q) cases (12. 6 % CC, 38. 1 % CG, 49. 2 % GG), non-del(5 q) cases (9. 7 % CC, 44. 6 % CG, 45. 7 % GG) and controls (7. 6 % CC, 37. 6 % CG, 54. 8 % GG) (P = 0. 13).

40|$|Article purchased; Published online: 27 Aug 2017 Cultivated bananas (Musa spp.) have {{undergone}} domestication patterns involving crosses of wild progenitors followed by {{long periods of}} clonal propagation. Majority of cultivated bananas are polyploids with different constitutive subgenomes and knowledge on phylogenies to their progenitors at the species and subspecies levels is essential. Here, the mitochondrial (NAD 1) and nuclear (CENH 3) markers were used to phylogenetically position cultivated banana genotypes to diploid progenitors. The CENH 3 nuclear marker was used to identify a minimum representative haplotype number in polyploids and diploid bananas based on single nucleotide polymorphisms. The mitochondrial marker NAD 1 was observed to be ideal in differentiating bananas of different genomic constitutions based on size of amplicons as well as sequence. The genotypes phylogenetically segregated based on the dominant genome; AAB genotypes grouped with AA and AAA, and the ABB together with BB. Both markers differentiated banana sections, but could not differentiate subspecies within the A genomic group. On the basis of CENH 3 marker, a total of 13 haplotypes (five in both diploid and triploid, three in diploids, and rest unique to triploids) were identified from the genotypes tested. The presence of haplotypes, which were common in diploids and triploids, stipulate possibility of a shared ancestry in the genotypes involved in this study. Furthermore, the presence of multiple haplotypes in some diploid bananas indicates their being heterozygous. The haplotypes identified {{in this study are}} of importance because they can be used to check the level of <b>homozygozity</b> in breeding lines as well as to track segregation in progenies.

We aimed to study the associations of CD 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and their interaction with breast milk sCD 14, with atopy development until age two. In addition, we assessed whether levels of sCD 14 in breast milk associated with SNPs in CD 14. Four SNPs in CD 14 gene were investigated in 698 infants and 188 mothers. Associations between these SNPs, sCD 14 and atopy development were analyzed in multiple logistic or linear regression models. The CD 14 /- 1619 SNP was associated with eczema. CC homozygotes showed a lower risk of eczema vs. TT homozygotes (adjusted odds ratio = 0. 56, 95 % confidence interval 0. 33 - 0. 96) in a co-dominant model. Breast milk sCD 14 levels did not significantly modify the effect of the child's CD 14 genotype on atopy development (p interaction > or = 0. 10).

40|$|Background: A {{subset of}} {{hereditary}} cerebellar ataxias is inherited as autosomal recessive traits (ARCAs). Classification of recessive ataxias due to phenotypic {{differences in the}} cerebellum and cerebellar structures is constantly evolving due to new identified disease genes. Recently, reports have linked mutations in genes involved in ubiquitination (RNF 216, OTUD 4, STUB 1) to ARCA with hypogonadism. Methods and results: With a combination of <b>homozygozity</b> mapping and exome sequencing, we identified three mutations in STUB 1 in two families with ARCA and cognitive impairment; a homozygous missense variant (c. 194 A > G, p. Asn 65 Ser) that segregated in three affected siblings, and a missense change (c. 82 G > A, p. Glu 28 Lys) which was inherited in trans with a nonsense mutation (c. 430 A > T, p. Lys 144 Ter) in another patient. STUB 1 encodes CHIP (C-terminus of Heat shock protein 70 – Interacting Protein), a dual function protein with a role in ubiquitination as a co-chaperone with heat shock proteins, and as an E 3 ligase. We show that the p. Asn 65 Ser substitution impairs CHIP’s ability to ubiquitinate HSC 70 in vitro, despite being able to self-ubiquitinate. These {{results are consistent with}} previous studies highlighting this as a critical residue for the interaction between CHIP and its co-chaperones. Furthermore, we show that the levels of CHIP are strongly reduced in vivo in patients’ fibroblasts compared to controls.

Variables with a P-value[*]≤[*] 0.10 were considered as the candidate variables. Interactions between variables also were tested at P-value[*]≤[*]. 05. The final model included five candidate variables (age, smoking status, alcohol consumption status, family history of breast cancer, MetS and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the interaction between MetS and HRT. In our next analysis, we restricted the reference group to controls with no history of exposure to HRT or smoking and no clinical documentation of MetS The final model included age, family history of breast cancer, HRT, MetS and the interaction between HRT and MetS. The estimated risk of PMBC was not significantly different from our first approach where all controls were inclusive. Therefore, we use this reference group to estimate the relative risk contributions of genetic polymorphism to PMBC in presence of clinico-demographic risk factors. For each SNP, testing each SNP individually for its association with PMBC, we used the Cockerham genetic model additive coding scheme and dominant coding scheme (Cordell 2002). For the additive coding approach, we assigned the zero, one or two to each SNP genotype according to the number of copies of minor alleles. For the dominant coding scheme, we assigned the value of one for rare <b>homozygozity</b> and zero for the alternative homozygotes. The SNPs which showed significant association by either coding scheme, were selected (P-value[*]<[*] 0.1). The final multivariable model was restricted to the dominant coding scheme and was adjusted by age, family history of breast cancer, HRT, MetS and the interaction between HRT and MetS. Finally, we evaluated the risk prediction ability of the final model by plotting the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculated area under the curve (AUC), which was equivalent to c-statistics, and reported for each model.|$|E
