40|$|Does a stop a {{commuter}} makes {{on the way}} to or from work adversely affect peak-period traffic? This question is addressed by examining the effects of stops made as part of commute journeys upon daily, as well as peak-period, travel time and distance, using a six-week travel diary data set from Germany. Increments in travel time and distance due to stops made in commute journeys are evaluated and used in the study, and a panel regression analysis is performed to determine contributions of stops of different types to travel time and distance. Findings include: public transit commuters on average make more stops as part of their commute journeys than do auto or non-motorized commuters; the travel time and distance of a commute journey increase with the number of stops it contains; and incorporating stops as part of commute journeys tends to make daily travel more efficient with more distances traversed with relatively less time, compared with the case where the same number of stops are all made outside commute journeys. Nonetheless, stops in commute journeys do add to peak-period travel time and <b>distance.</b> <b>Stops</b> made before work do not produce very much incremental travel in the morning pea...|$|E

At present there are several calculation methods about them, but all these methods have large error. Based on the research of the existing calculation methods, this paper simplifies vessel resistance and calculates vessel’s <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> and crash <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> accurately by means of physical and mathematical methods. 1 forward Vessel’s <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> (VSD) and Vessel’s crash <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> (VCSD) are two important indexes measuring the braking performance of the vessel. They have very important influence on the vessel navigation safety. Calculation of them {{is one of the major}} problems in Marine research. As early as the 1970 s, Chinese scholars Wang FengChen and Liu ZhengJiang et al. began to make research on large vessel’s stopping performance. [1, 2, 3] These research mainly used regression method on the measured data of VCSD to get the VCSD calculation formula. Foreign scholars have carried out extensive research, such as Tani, Okamoto, Havald, respectively put forward their own views and methods about the calculation of the VCSD for different type of vessel...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. In {{the paper}} it is {{necessary}} to estimate the determination accuracy of a car <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> during the test by the method of sequential braking. The method of sequential braking is applied for experimental evaluation of the <b>stopping</b> <b>distances.</b> Unlike the abandonment method when a sample car is disconnected from the tractive connection and they record the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of a single car from the moment of uncoupling to the moment of stop, the method of sequential braking involves <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> measurement of the tractive connection, the integrity of which {{in the course of the}} test is not affected, but its set (locomotive, locomotive with the track test car or with a sample car) at the different stages of the test is changed. Direct measuring of the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of a sample car is not possible using this way, it requires calculating of the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> values of the tractive connection. This adversely affects the accuracy of the result, but it can increase the safety level of the test. Methodology. To evaluate the accuracy researches have conducted the numerical experiment, which simulated experimental processing of <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> values. An error was found by giving disturbance of basic data (<b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of tractive connection of different configuration) and analyzing the resulted scatter of readings (<b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of a single car). Findings. The study proved: 1) the relative error of car <b>stopping</b> <b>distances</b> value, with relative error of basic data 1 %, made 3. 3 - 19. 7 % (depending on the tractive connection variant). 2) the proposed ways of error reduction (without track test car, less-weighed-locomotive use) allowed declining the error to 2. 15 - 5. 1 %. Originality. The methodology of error estimation of car <b>stopping</b> <b>distances</b> determination under tests by the method of sequential braking was proposed. Practical value. Work results make it possible to replace the running brake tests by the abandonment method, under which the integrity of tractive connections is broken, with safer testing by the method of sequential braking, providing the level of result accuracy of 2 - 5 %...|$|R
40|$|When {{the city}} centre {{is the major}} {{destination}} of the passengers, public transport vehicles will get fuller as they approach it. The disadvantage of time loss due to stops {{on the way to}} the centre is thus experienced by an increasing number of travellers. We demonstrate that optimal <b>stop</b> <b>distances</b> increase as vehicles get closer to the centre. This is at variance with the usual assumption of constant <b>stop</b> <b>distances</b> employed in this type of models. A Countervailing force is that urban densities increase as one approaches the centre.

The <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of the car comprises the braking distance and the reaction distance. One of the causes of the unexpected prolongation of the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> is a lengthening of the reaction distance.

The result of the experiment showed that the mean RTs for driving conditions were larger than that of a stopping condition. There are no differences between the mean RT of each speed condition.

The result of other experiments showed that the RT while driving under hasty conditions was larger than that while driving under ordinary condition. Thus, the authors suggested that hasty driving must be deterred to avoid collisions...|$|R
