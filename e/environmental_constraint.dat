5|$|The carbon:nutrient balance {{hypothesis}}, {{also known}} as the <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint</b> hypothesis or Carbon Nutrient Balance Model (CNBM), states that the various types of plant defenses are responses to variations in the levels of nutrients in the environment. This hypothesis predicts the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio in plants determines which secondary metabolites will be synthesized. For example, plants growing in nitrogen-poor soils will use carbon-based defenses (mostly digestibility reducers), while those growing in low-carbon environments (such as shady conditions) are more likely to produce nitrogen-based toxins. The hypothesis further predicts that plants can change their defenses in response to changes in nutrients. For example, if plants are grown in low-nitrogen conditions, then these plants will implement a defensive strategy composed of constitutive carbon-based defenses. If nutrient levels subsequently increase, by for example the addition of fertilizers, these carbon-based defenses will decrease.|$|E

50|$|The pseudogenes {{mentioned}} earlier {{are produced by}} a number of gene silencing events, the rate of which is constant throughout primate species. Several of these pseudogenes do maintain a role in modulating taste response, however. By studying the silencing events in humans, it is possible to theorize the selective pressures on humans throughout their evolutionary history. As is the case with the usual distribution of human genetic variation, the highest rate of diversity in TAS2R pseudogenes was often found in African populations. This was not the case with two pseudogene loci: TAS2R6P and TAS2R18P, where the highest diversity was found in non-African populations. This suggests that the functional versions of these genes arose before the human migration out of Africa into an area where selective constraint did not remove non-functional versions of these gene loci. This allowed the pseudogene frequency to increase, creating genetic variance at those loci. This is an example of relaxed <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint</b> allowing silencing mutations to lead to pseudogenization of once important loci.|$|E

Slow-changing <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints</b> shape slow-changing evolutionary organismic constraints or traits (e.g., human structure and functions); relatively faster changing <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints</b> (e.g., fans’ support) shape faster changing organismic constraints or states (e.g., mood); and even faster changing <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints</b> (e.g., ball trajectory) shape the even faster organismic constraints (e.g., perceptions).

40|$|A {{scheduling}} {{method is}} reported to satisfy the reliability limit and the <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint</b> when a line fault is regarded as probabilistic. The reliability limit is satisfied by changing the thermal output power to probabilistically achieve every line’s capacity. NO_x emission from thermal stations is limited as a typical <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint.</b> These constraints are economically achieved. The LaGrange’s method and the Kuhn-Tucker conditions are used to satisfy both the line capacity and the emission constraint. The LaGrange’s multipliers are decided by solving the simultaneous equations. An economical method of achieving the reliability limit is described using the probability of the line fault and the increase of the operating cost. 　Simulating the proposed method by a model system, the results are variously investigated. The proposed method is concretely confirmed to estimate the optimum operation which can economically satisfy the reliability limits and the emission constraints at various values. It is also shown that the proposed method can improve reliability by more than 16 ％. ...|$|E

30|$|Based on genome {{comparisons}} (from prokaryotes and eukaryotes), {{it seems}} that the occurrence of a single duplication event is much more common (giving rise to di-domains) in protein genes than several duplication events (Apic et al. 2001; Björklund et al. 2005), except for protein genes that were already multi-domain. In this case the replication of several domains at once is usually the norm, producing domain repeats (Björklund et al. 2005).

40|$|Nowadays, {{environmental}} impacts {{are becoming more}} and more important in urban network traffic management. However, traditional urban traffic management approaches are predominantly geared towards satisfying the traffic demand, and do not consider the environmental effects in the design phase. Calculation of the generated emissions is usually foreseen after the calculation of traffic volume data via traffic assignment models. This paper describes a new methodology which uses the <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints</b> as key input for defining network wide traffic management strategies. Both flow and {{environmental impacts}} are calculated simultaneously instead of evaluating the environmental impacts for a given specific flow pattern. The methodology that allows integrating the traffic and emission models, including the inversion process of utilizing <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints</b> as input for the network traffic management, will be elaborated. On the link level this means that the suggested methodology will adjust the (flow) capacity of a link according to the various <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints</b> that apply. The subsequent flow pattern represents the basis for the design of an environment-friendly traffic network. The key element in the process is the development of a speed-flow diagram on each link based on the relevant <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints.</b> Combining the speed-flow diagrams related to the <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints</b> and the fundamental speed-flow diagram a new (integrated) speed flow diagram will be obtained, addressing all constraints simultaneously. Therefore, the maximum flow which is assigned to a link applying the new speed-flow diagram will satisfy both traffic capacity and <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints.</b> Applying this methodology to a network, the assignment results represent the capacities that meet the <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints</b> (the <b>environmental</b> capacities); this result can thus be obtained in one step avoiding a long iterative procedure of trial and error, involving the adjustment of the link capacities. A wide range of possible traffic management and capacity management measures that can be applied to accommodate differences between flow capacity and environmental capacity will be indentified in the last part of the paper. Further details, including the proposed traffic models, emission models and traffic variables, are discussed in the paper. status: publishe...|$|R
