He then read extracts from speeches by the King Kleagle of the Maine Ku Klux Klan, F. Eugene Farnsworth, calling him [...] "an ignorant demagogue". [...] In his 1925 speech against {{a new version of the}} same bill, Hale cited examples of recent intolerance in American political life, including the rejection of German language teaching during World War I and Tennessee's law against the teaching of evolution. Referring again to the Ku Klux Klan of Maine, who had demonstrated their strength during a recent Maine State Senate debate on the same bill, Hale said that only the defeat of the Barwise measure would [...] "appease this hysteria". Hale was a convincing champion of the Anti-Barwise forces because he was a Protestant Republican from Portland, a Klan <b>hotbed.</b> The <b>bill</b> was defeated, but Hale's opposition to it likely defeated his own initial bid to become Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives in 1926.

40|$|Today we {{have been}} living in the 21 century. Much has been debated and done for women's empowerment. But is he really empowered, safe and secure and has the right to live like a human being? Women are not safe in any country, in any society, even in own family. It's a shame and a matter of grave concern. It is one of the life's bitter ironies that rape victims who deserve empathy from society are ostracized in many cases and stigmatized {{to such an extent that}} there have been many {{instances}} where they have committed suicide out of sheer frustration. Even family members turn hostile at times and this adds to the desperation of those girls and women who eventually become depressed and lead sordid lives though they are hardly at fault as they have been brutalized against their will. Most cases of rape remain unreported worldwide and are more so in the nonwestern world like India. Rapes and sexual assaults against women is not a new story but the change in nature of these incidents and the forces behind them needs immediate investigation. It is time, society must change views on rape victims and the realization that they have been wronged and deserve to be rehabilitated should dawn on everyone. Rather than pounce on the innocent by branding them as fallen women. Society should shun the perpetrators of the crime and cooperate with the law-enforcing authorities in bringing them to book. More and more young men should come forward to marry young rape victims as that would give them a foothold in life and enable them to come out of their shell. After a paramedical student in December, 2012, died after she was gang-raped, beaten and thrown out of a moving bus along with a male friend in Delhi on December 16 last year, the government had promised to make the nation safer for women. In fact, a Rs. 1, 000 /- million sums was set aside in the Union Budget to create a fund for women safety. The anti-rape Bill can be misused as stalking is not done only by men, but by women also.
