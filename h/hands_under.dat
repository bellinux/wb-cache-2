5|$|Assaf Tarabay was not {{reinstated}} as governor, but Lajjun {{remained in}} Tarabay <b>hands,</b> <b>under</b> {{the rule of}} Governor Tarabay ibn Ali who was succeeded upon his death by his son Ahmad in 1601, who also ruled {{until his death in}} 1657. Ahmad, known for his courage and hospitality, helped the Ottomans defeat the rebel Janbulad and gave shelter to Yusuf Sayfa — Janbulad's principal rival. Ahmad, in coordination with the governors of Gaza (the Ridwan family) and Jerusalem (the Farrukh family), also fought against Fakhr ad-Din II in a prolonged series of battles, which ended with the victory of the Tarabay-Ridwan-Farrukh alliance after their forces routed Fakhr ad-Din's army at the al-Auja river in central Palestine in 1623.|$|E
5|$|Beli Orao (White Eagle) was a royal yacht {{built for}} the Royal Yugoslav Navy in 1939–1940, with the {{intention}} she would serve as an escort in wartime. She was captured by the Italians during the World War II Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, and was re-armed and saw service as a gunboat in the Royal Italian Navy, briefly as Alba then Zagabria, undertaking harbour protection and coastal escort duties. After the Italian armistice with the Allies in September 1943, she was handed back to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile in December of that year. After the war she remained in Yugoslav <b>hands</b> <b>under</b> the names Biokovo then Jadranka, serving as a naval yacht and as a presidential yacht for the President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito, and also as a dispatch boat. In 1978, {{she was still in}} service as a private yacht.|$|E
5|$|The {{events that}} would cost Cumanus his office began {{with the murder of}} one or more Galilean pilgrims who had been {{travelling}} through Samaria on their way to Jerusalem. A Galilean embassy asked Cumanus to investigate but received little attention; Josephus alleges that he had been bribed by the Samaritans to turn a blind eye. The result was that a crowd of Jews decided to take the law into their own <b>hands.</b> <b>Under</b> the leadership of two Zealots, Eleazar and Alexander, they invaded Samaria and began a massacre. Cumanus led most of his troops against the militants, killing many and taking others prisoner, and the Jewish leaders from Jerusalem were subsequently able to calm most of the others, but a state of guerrilla warfare persisted.|$|E

As a consequence, that part of the collection remained in Jordanian <b>hands</b> <b>under</b> their Department of Antiquities. In 2013 parts of this collection have been put on display at The Jordan Museum in Amman, to which they were moved from the Jordan Archaeological Museum. Among the display items are artifacts from the Qumran site and the Copper Scroll.|$|E

25|$|After the War of the Spanish Succession in {{the early}} 18th century, {{possession}} of the kingdom again changed <b>hands.</b> <b>Under</b> {{the terms of the}} Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, Naples was given to CharlesVI, the Holy Roman Emperor. He also gained control of Sicily in 1720, but Austrian rule did not last long. Both Naples and Sicily were conquered by a Spanish army during the War of the Polish Succession in 1734, and Charles, Duke of Parma, a younger son of King PhilipV of Spain was installed as King of Naples and Sicily from 1735. When Charles inherited the Spanish throne from his older half-brother in 1759, he left Naples and Sicily to his younger son, FerdinandIV. Despite the two kingdoms being in a personal union under the House of Bourbon from 1735 onwards, they remained constitutionally separated.|$|E

25|$|The Latter Days (Hodder & Stoughton, 1953), re{{published}} as Latter Days at Colditz, {{also published}} {{with the title}} Men of Colditz: Whilst his first book ended with Reid and Wardle shaking <b>hands</b> <b>under</b> the first Swiss lamp post, the sequel follows the trials and tribulations of the escape committee until the eventual liberation of the castle by U.S. troops on 15 April 1945. It gives even more anecdotal insight into the events following his escape, including the French Tunnel and the Colditz Glider, or the occasion when the entire Dutch contingent unhooked their P.O.W. railway carriage {{from the rest of}} the train unbeknownst to the German guards. This last part of the Dutch prisoners cannot be confirmed by any Dutch reference about PoWs. Reid probably refers to the mass escape of Dutch officers from train transports towards the end of the war when they were transported from Stanislau to Neubrandenburg.|$|E
25|$|The match {{had already}} had a moment of {{controversy}} earlier. During the Australian innings, Martin Snedden claimed a low outfield catch off the batting of Greg Chappell when Chappell was on 58. It was ruled not out by the umpires. It was some years before TV replays {{could be used in}} umpiring decisions. Viewers watching replays had divided opinions: some thought it was a clean catch, while others say it passed through the fielder's fingers to touch the grass before coming to rest in his hands. (If modern TV umpiring review had been in use, there was sufficient doubt to rule it not out.) Some commentators believed that Chappell should have taken Snedden's word that the catch was good, as had been a time honoured tradition. Chappell maintained he was not sure about the catch and was within his rights to wait for the umpires to rule. Chappell went on to score 90, before he was caught by Bruce Edgar in similar fashion. This time, Chappell walked after he clearly saw the fielder had cupped his <b>hands</b> <b>under</b> the ball.|$|E

Among the [...] of marble inside the Wells Fargo Building is the cream-colored terrazzo marble used throughout the banking hall. At the rear of the hall is a marble sculpture by the Piccirilli Brothers.

500|$|He {{was later}} hired by Jim Crockett {{and moved to}} the Carolinas to compete. While there, he began teaming with Rip Hawk to form a tag team known as the [...] "Blond Bombers". They competed as heels (villains) and were hated by the crowds. During appearances, fans would throw acid or {{threaten}} them with knives and guns. In one attack, Hanson was stabbed in the leg and required 72 stitches. Hawk taught Hanson a move called the reverse neckbreaker, which saw Hanson stand back-to-back with his opponent, clasp his <b>hands</b> <b>under</b> the opponent's chin, and fall to the ring floor while pulling the opponent with him. This became Hanson's signature manoeuvre that he used in most matches.|$|E
500|$|Considered {{a radical}} troublemaker by the GLC's Labour management, Livingstone was {{allocated}} the relatively unimportant position of Vice Chairman of the Film Viewing Board, monitoring {{the release of}} soft pornography. Like most Board members, Livingstone opposed cinematic censorship, a view he changed with the increasing availability of violent pornography. With growing support from Labour leftists, in March 1974 he was elected onto the executive of the Greater London Labour Party (GLLP), responsible for drawing up the manifesto for the GLC Labour group and the lists of candidates for council and parliamentary seats. Turning his attention once more to housing, he became Vice Chairman of the GLC's Housing Management Committee, however was sacked in April 1975 for his vocal opposition to the Goodwin administration's decision to cut £50,000,000 from the GLC's house-building budget. Coming up to the 1977 GLC elections, Livingstone recognised the difficulty of retaining his Norwood seat, instead being selected for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, a Labour safe seat, following the retirement of David Pitt. Accused of being a [...] "carpetbagger", it ensured {{he was one of}} the few leftist Labour councillors to remain on the GLC, which fell into Conservative <b>hands</b> <b>under</b> Horace Cutler.|$|E

2500|$|The Fort George {{plantation}} {{was sold}} soon after Kingsley's death. After the Civil War, the Freedmen's Bureau controlled the island until 1869, {{when it was}} purchased by another planter. The island changed <b>hands</b> <b>under</b> private ownership until 1955, when it was acquired by the Florida Park Service. Kingsley's house, [...] "the oldest standing plantation house in Florida"; Ma'am Anna House, and the barn survived the years relatively intact. Most of the slave quarters did as well. The National Park Service established the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve in 1988 and acquired [...] of land surrounding the Kingsley Plantation buildings in 1991.|$|E
2500|$|Roger left {{religious}} and judicial authority in local <b>hands,</b> <b>under</b> a local governor (‘āmil). In each town {{there was a}} Sicilian garrison under a Sicilian commander, and a poll tax (jizyah) was instituted on the Muslim communities, similar to that which they had until then exacted from Jews and Christians, but lighter than that which was demanded of Sicilian Muslims at the same time. The local Christian community, largely servile and enslaved, probably benefited from Roger's rule. Bishop Cosmas of Mahdia made a trip to Rome to be confirmed by Pope Eugene III and also to Palermo to visit his new sovereign. The anonymous continuator of Sigebert of Gembloux refers to Cosmas as returning to Africa [...] "a free man".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the mission}} in Jalpan [...] was {{established}} before Junípero Serra’s 1750 arrival into the region, Serra is {{given credit for}} building the five main missions of this area and completing the evangelization of the local people. In reality, the missions were built by Pame <b>hands,</b> <b>under</b> the direction of various Franciscan monks including José Antonio de Murguía in Concá, Juan Crispi in Tilaco, Juan Ramos de Lora in Tancoyol and Miguel de la Campa in Landa. However, the vision for {{the building of the}} missions was Serra’s, as he imagined a type of utopia based on Franciscan principles. Serra insisted that the missionaries learn the local languages and experience hunger {{along with the rest of}} the population. There was still hostility to the Spanish presence, and Serra’s response was economic as well as spiritual.|$|E

2500|$|With the Russian forces {{making more}} rapid {{advances}} into German-held territory than the Allies, {{there was a}} sudden public realisation that the Soviet Union was about to dominate large parts of eastern Europe. In fact, at the Cairo and Tehran Conferences in 1943 Britain and America had already agreed to allow Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary to fall under the Soviet sphere of influence after the war, with shared influence in Yugoslavia. The UK was to retain hegemony over Greece, although there had been no agreement over Poland, whose eastern territories were already in Soviet [...] <b>hands</b> <b>under</b> the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Germany, and which retained a government in exile in London. De Gaulle had not been invited to any of the 'Big Three' Conferences, although the decisions made by Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt in dividing up Europe were of huge importance to France.|$|E
2500|$|The {{marriage}} ceremony {{consisted of two}} parts. The Orthodox service took place first and was performed by the Metropolitans of St Petersburg, Moscow, and Kiev in the Imperial Chapel. Grand Dukes Vladimir, Alexis, and Sergei and the groom's brother Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, relieved each other taking turns holding the golden crowns {{over the head of}} the bride and groom. Maria wore a glittering coronet and a mantle of crimson velvet trimmed with ermine and a sprig of myrtle, specially sent by Queen Victoria. Alfred wore the uniform of the Royal Navy. The Tsar looked pale throughout the entire ceremony and said afterwards: [...] "It is for her happiness, but the light of my life has gone out." [...] After this, the bride and groom each drank thrice from a goblet of wine. The service concluded with the couple joining <b>hands</b> <b>under</b> the priest’s stole. Then they all proceeded to the Alexander Hall, where Arthur Stanley, Dean of Westminster, made Prince Alfred and Maria Alexandrovna man and wife according to the rites of the Church of England.|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{became aware}} of Tammy Wynette because their tours were booked by the same agency and their paths {{sometimes}} crossed after Wynette's first minor hit [...] "Apartment #9" [...] in 1966, which was written by Johnny Paycheck. Wynette was married to songwriter Don Chapel, who was also the opening act for her shows at the time. The three became friends but eventually Jones {{took more than a}} passing fancy to Wynette, who was 11 years his junior and grew up listening to all of his records. According to his autobiography, Jones went to their house for supper and while she was fixing the meal Wynette and Chapel got into a heated exchange with Chapel calling his wife [...] "a son of a bitch." [...] Jones wrote: [...] "I felt rage fly all over me. I jumped from my chair, put my <b>hands</b> <b>under</b> the dinner table, and flipped it over. Dishes, utensils, and glasses flew in all directions. [...] Don's and Tammy's eyes got about as big as the flying dinner plates." [...] Jones professed his love for Wynette on the spot and the couple were married in 1969.|$|E
