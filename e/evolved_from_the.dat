5|$|Archaea, a {{group of}} prokaryotes {{separate}} from bacteria, also feature flagella driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and evolutionarily distinct from bacterial flagella. Whereas bacterial flagella <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bacterial Type III secretion system, archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from Type IV pili.|$|E
5|$|As Biblical Hebrew <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Proto-Semitic {{language}} it {{underwent a}} number of consonantal mergers parallel with those in other Canaanite languages. There {{is no evidence that}} these mergers occurred after the adaptation of the Hebrew alphabet.|$|E
50|$|While {{the snow}} and the brig might appear closely related, this is in fact not the case. The two rigs {{developed}} <b>from</b> different directions, <b>the</b> brig <b>evolving</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> generally smaller brigantine, and the much older snow <b>evolving</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> larger three masted ship.|$|R

5|$|The {{groups are}} divided {{based on their}} {{alternative}} strategies of parasitizing its host colony (Myrmica ants). The predatory (in which the caterpillar preys on the host ants) and 'cuckoo' (in which the caterpillars feed off of the ants' regurgitation) strategies are derived characteristics from the alcon group, with the predatory strategy having <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> teleius group and the cuckoo strategy having <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> arion-Phengaris group. Another way these groups are categorized is by {{whether or not they}} release a certain chemical (dorsal nectary organ secretions) {{to attract the attention of}} the host ant. This trait is not as prominent in ancestors of the alcon group and in the M. nausithous, which is part of the teleius group.|$|E
5|$|A BLT (Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato) {{is a type}} {{of bacon}} sandwich. The {{standard}} BLT is made up of four ingredients: bacon, lettuce, tomato, and bread. The BLT <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tea sandwiches served at a similar time to the club sandwich, although it is unclear when the name BLT became the norm.|$|E

50|$|In {{the example}} of the double-slit experiment, the first state vector <b>evolves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{electron}} leaving its source, the second state vector <b>evolves</b> backwards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> final location of the electron on the detection screen, and the combination of forwards and backwards evolving state vectors determines what occurs when the electron passes the slits.|$|R
5|$|American {{football}} <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sports {{of association}} football (soccer) and rugby football. Rugby football, like American football, is a sport where two competing teams vie {{for control of}} a ball, which can be kicked {{through a set of}} goalposts or run into the opponent's goal area to score points.|$|E
5|$|Four super {{radiations}} {{of insects}} have occurred: beetles (evolved about 300 million years ago), flies (evolved about 250 million years ago), and moths and wasps (evolved about 150 million years ago). These four groups {{account for the}} majority of described species. The flies and moths along with the fleas <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mecoptera.|$|E
5|$|Hymenoptera in {{the form}} of Symphyta (Xyelidae) first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Lower Triassic. Apocrita, wasps in the broad sense, appeared in the Jurassic, and had diversified into many of the extant superfamilies by the Cretaceous; they appear to have <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Symphyta. Fig wasps with modern anatomical features first appeared in the Lower Cretaceous of the Crato Formation in Brazil, some 65 million years before the first fig trees.|$|E

5|$|Many later {{attempts}} to draft constitutional forms of government trace their lineage back to Magna Carta. The British dominions, Australia and New Zealand, Canada (except Quebec), and formerly the Union of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, reflected {{the influence of}} Magna Carta in their laws, and the Charter's effects {{can be seen in}} the laws of other states that <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British Empire.|$|E
5|$|Most of Bath's Grade I listed {{buildings}} {{are made from}} the local golden-coloured Bath Stone, and date from the 18th and 19th centuries. Their dominant architectural style is Georgian, which <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Palladian revival style that became popular during the early 18th century. This led to the entire city's designation as a World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian army {{units were}} skiing for sport (and prizes) in the 18th century. Starting {{in the latter}} part of the 20th century, {{technique}} <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> striding in-track classic technique to include skate-skiing, which occurs on courses that have been groomed with wide lanes for those using the technique. At the same time, equipment evolved from skis and poles that were made of wood and other natural materials to comprising such man-made materials as fiberglass, carbon fiber, and polyethylene plastics.|$|E

5|$|Standard Swedish, {{spoken by}} most Swedes, is the {{national}} language that <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established {{by the beginning of}} the 20th century.

5|$|The M19 <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 40mm Gun Motor Carriage T65 project, {{which was}} based on an Armored Force {{requirement}} for a light anti-aircraft vehicle based on the M5 light tank chassis. Although trials were successful and a production of 1,000 T65s had been requested, the project was stopped by the Ordnance Department since the M5A1 light tank chassis was being phased out of production.|$|E
5|$|The Sex Pistols <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Strand, a London band {{formed in}} 1972 by working-class {{teenagers}} Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar. According to a later account by Jones, {{both he and}} Cook played instruments they had stolen. They would go to concerts, and when these were over they would go up on stage and steal as much musical equipment as they could carry.|$|E

5|$|The curial {{office of}} Cardinal Secretary of State {{in many ways}} <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> roles {{formerly}} filled by cardinal-nephews. From 1644 to 1692, {{the power of the}} Cardinal Secretary of State was essentially inversely proportional to that of the Cardinal Nephew, to whom the Secretariat was subordinate. During some pontificates, for example that of Pope Pius V (1566–1572) and his nephew Michele Bonelli, the cardinal-nephew and secretary of state were one and the same.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} cat {{is believed}} to have <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Near Eastern wildcat, whose range covers vast portions of the Middle East westward to the Atlantic coast of Africa. Between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago the animal gave rise to the genetic lineage that eventually produced all domesticated cats, having diverged from the Near Eastern wildcat around 8,000 BC in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|The early {{development}} of cultigen taxonomy follows that of plant taxonomy in general {{as the early}} listing and documentation of plants made little distinction between those that were anthropogenic and those that were natural wild kinds. Formal botanical nomenclature and classification <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> simple binomial system of folk taxonomy {{and it was not}} until the mid-19th century that the nomenclatural path of cultigens began to diverge from mainstream plant taxonomy.|$|E
50|$|Carbodiimides {{are formed}} by {{dehydration}} of ureas or from thioureas. They are also formed by treating organic isocyanates with suitable catalysts (generally based on phosphine oxides); in this process, carbon dioxide <b>evolves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> isocyanate.|$|R

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{question}} of whether or not, for a given tessellationautomaton, there exists a finite pattern that cannot <b>evolve</b> <b>from</b> a given primitive pattern no matter what sequence of environmental input transformations are applied. This is closely related to Moore's Garden-of-Eden problem. We begin dealing with this question for the simplest nontrivial tessellation automata, namely, one-dimensional binary scope-n tessellation automata. We show that any finite pattern can <b>evolve</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> primitive pattern if the neighborhood scope is four or more. We show that there are finite patterns that cannot <b>evolve</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> primitive pattern for the scope-two case. Although some partial results are presented, the question is still open for the scope-three case. Some results for more general tessellation automata are also discussed...|$|R
