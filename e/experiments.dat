5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the Western media. Gandhi's public <b>experiments,</b> as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi {{said that if he}} would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his <b>experiments.</b> Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation <b>experiments</b> were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{advancing}} science, several <b>experiments</b> observing {{the reaction of}} frogs to slowly heated water {{took place in the}} 19th century. In 1869, while doing <b>experiments</b> searching for the location of the soul, German physiologist Friedrich Goltz demonstrated that a frog that has had its brain removed will remain in slowly heated water, but an intact frog attempted to escape the water when it reached 25°C.|$|E
