40|$|As {{part of a}} {{study of}} the {{charring}} rate of wood, I determined the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> values (gross heat of combustion) and the chemical composition of samples from four hardwoods and four softwoods. The <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of wood was correlated with lignin and extractive contents. There was a highly significant linear correlation between the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of the extractive-free wood and lignin content. Equations are presented {{that can be used to}} determine the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of extractive-free wood when the Klason lignin content is known.

An experimental study was carried out to obtain <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of a few waste samples. The <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value was obtained through calorimetric experiment using a bomb calorimeter.

[...] An 1890s-built two-storey terraced house with a drawing room, a dining room, a kitchen, a scullery, a bathroom, three bedrooms (there were actually four, but one {{was used as a}} safety room with a telephone) and an outside loo. To make it the 1900 house, all modern elements were removed, including electricity, insulation, indoor toilet, and central heating.

40|$|This {{research}} {{provides a}} novel approach for the determination of water content and <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis oil from Napier grass {{was used in this}} study. Water content was determined with pH adjustment using a Karl Fischer titration unit. An equation for actual water in the oil was developed and used, and the results were compared with the traditional Karl Fischer method. The oil was found to have between 42 and 64 % moisture under the same pyrolysis condition depending on the properties of the Napier grass prior to the pyrolysis. The <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of the pyrolysis oil was determined using an oil-diesel mixture, and 20 to 25 wt% of the oil in the mixture gave optimum and stable results. A new model was developed for evaluation of <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of dry pyrolysis oil. The dry oil has <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> values in the range between 19 and 26 MJ/kg. The developed protocols and equations may serve as a reliable alternative means for establishing the actual water content and the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of pyrolysis oil...|$|R
40|$|Acid- and rennet-induced {{gelation}} {{properties of}} milk with modified casein micelles, produced by partial renneting at 4 oC for 15 min, followed by inactivation of enzymes by heat at 60 oC/ 3 min (referred as low heat treatment milk) and 85 oC/ 30 min (<b>high</b> <b>heat</b> treatment milk), were investigated {{to provide a}} mechanistic understanding of gel formation from partially renneted milk. Acidification of low heat treatment milk gave firmer gel quality, this was reflected by its high elastic modulus (G′) and hardness. In addition, the <b>high</b> <b>heating</b> condition for enzyme inactivation of <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> treatment milk alone increased the elastic modulus of both the control and renneted milk samples. Gel development of the two milk types (low <b>heat</b> treatment and <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> treatment milks) was different. In contrast with acid gelation, rennet-induced gelation of partially pre-rennet treated milk had {{no impact on the}} elastic modulus of low heat treatment milk and the rennet gels were very weak. Similarly, the addition of rennet to pre-rennet treated <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> treatment milk did not produce “true gels,” most likely due to the effect of the heat treatment on impairing the rennet coagulation. The findings in this study confirmed that pre-rennet treated milk had positive effects on the end-product acid gels of low <b>heat</b> treatment and <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> treatment milk...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The great {{majority}} of investigations of thermal transport in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the open literature focus on low heat fluxes, that is, in the regime of validity of the Fourier heat conduction law. In this paper, by performing nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations we investigated thermal transport in a single-walled CNT bridging two Si slabs under constant <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> flux. An anomalous wave-like kinetic energy profile was observed, and a previously unexplored, wave-dominated energy transport mechanism is identified for <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> fluxes in CNTs, originated from excited low frequency transverse acoustic waves. The transported energy, {{in terms of a}} one-dimensional low frequency mechanical wave, is quantified {{as a function of the}} total heat flux applied and is compared to the energy transported by traditional Fourier heat conduction. The results show that the low frequency wave actually overtakes traditional Fourier heat conduction and efficiently transports the energy at <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> flux. Our findings reveal an important new mechanism for <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> flux energy transport in low-dimensional nanostructures, such as one-dimensional (1 -D) nanotubes and nanowires, which could be very relevant to <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> flux dissipation such as in micro/nanoelectronics applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the energy recovery potential of lignocellulosic crops as solid biofuel depends on various characteristics. One of the main characteristics in this field is the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value. It {{is defined as the}} amount of heat emitted by the combustion of a fuel, including the heat coming from the condensation of the water vapor. Its value depends on the content of main components of the lignocellulosic crops. Two models predicting the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value have been built based on the content of main components of the following lignocellulosic crops: miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus J. M. Greef & Deuter ex Hodk. & Renvoize), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), Jerusalem artichoke (aerial part) (Helianthus tuberosus L.), fiber sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), fiber corn (Zea mays L.) and hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) [trials made at Libramont (Belgium) in 2007 and 2008 J. The first model predicts the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of the lignocellulosic crops based on sum of the products between the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of each component and its amount. The second model predicts the <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of the lignocellulosic crop based on a multiple linear regression using step by step least mean squares...|$|R
50|$|Despite its strength, ramie has {{had limited}} {{acceptance}} for textile use. The fiber's extraction and cleaning are expensive, chiefly {{because of the}} several steps—involving scraping, pounding, <b>heating,</b> <b>washing,</b> or exposure to chemicals. Some or all are needed to separate the raw fiber from the adhesive gums or resins {{in which it is}} ensheathed. Spinning the fiber is made difficult by its brittle quality and low elasticity; and weaving is complicated by the hairy surface of the yarn, resulting from lack of cohesion between the fibers. The greater utilization of ramie depends upon the development of improved processing methods.|$|R

The physiochemical properties of fuel are important in design of fuel system for compression ignition engine run on diesel,biodiesel or biodiesel blend. The HHV is an important property which characterizes the energy content of a fuel such as solid, liquid and gaseous fuels. The biodiesels were characterized for their physical and main fuel properties including viscosity, density, flash point and <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value. The viscosities of biodiesels were much less than those of pure oils and their HHV’s of approximately 42 MJ/kg were 10 % less than those of petro diesel fuels. The HHVs of vegetable oils and their biodiesels were measured and correlated using linear least square regression analysis. An equation was developed relating HHV and thermal properties.
