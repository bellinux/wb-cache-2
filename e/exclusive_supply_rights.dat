40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} {{the ways in which}} {{intellectual}} property law can act as a barrier to data sharing. Intellectual property laws <b>supply</b> <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> that can enable a researcher, employer or funder to ‘own’ data; they can then bring legal claims against persons who access or reuse data without permission. Some of these rights attach automatically to data, data sets, or databases, and thus must be managed properly to enable robust data sharing in climate science. Other rights are created by contract, and the policies around such privately created rights must be understood and analyzed. This chapter briefly describes the variety of climate data needed by researchers and the role of intellectual property and related rights in governing access to and use of such data...|$|R

40|$|The author {{examines}} a {{link between}} downstream foreclosure and upstream innovation. The crucial ingredient of the model {{is the presence of}} dynamic economies of scale upstream in the form of competition in R&D. The reason an upstream supplier has a captive buyer is to force rival suppliers to incur the disadvantages of low-scale production and discourage them from innovating. The downstream buyer is offered favorable terms and is 'convinced' to sign an <b>exclusive</b> <b>supply</b> contract and accept captivity. In this context, downstream foreclosure may reduce consumer welfare. Copyright 1997 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

But the other control strategies {{are successful in}} the glucose normalization. In analogy to the hyperglycemic problems, Case c yields the desired state at fastest within 20 minutes. But certainly {{the composition of the}} controls is different: the enteral tube feeding plays here the major role. The parenteral nutrition is just applied as support within the first 30 minutes in combination with a little rate of insulin. Without the intravenous access (Case b) it takes longer to reach the desired state (more than 2 hours). The results are reasonable and show again a very stabilized blood glucose level {{at the end of the}} observation interval without any fluctuations. Repeating the computations for diabetes type 1 yields comparable results, but the supplies of enteral nutrition and insulin are longer and higher (Figure  6 (bottom)). Only the simulation of Case a raises questions as the <b>exclusive</b> <b>supply</b> of insulin causes an increase of the blood glucose concentration. This is unexpected and requires further investigations.|$|R

This arbitrage increases {{the overall cost}} of transporting gasoline from refinery to consumer by substituting high-cost truck transport for cheap bulk transportation. This paper provides a simple model of how arbitrage can lead either to a less dense terminal network or, in some instances, to a less dense network of dealers than refiners would prefer. Enforceable <b>exclusive</b> <b>supply</b> agreements can increase inventory holding, provide protection against excessive price volatility, and reduce transportation costs. An end to such agreements will likely impair the ability of branded dealers to differentiate themselves from unbranded rivals. Gasoline, Distribution, Inventories, Open Supply,...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis] In {{light of}} the expiry of the EU milk quota in April 2015, the German Federal Association of Dairy Farmers (Bundesverband Deutscher Milchviehhalter e. V. (BDM)) and the European Milk Board (EMB) have put forward a {{proposal}} for the future management of the dairy market. The central element of this proposal is a Monitoring Agency which will not only monitor the milk market on a permanent basis and analyse developments but also implement a Market Responsibility Programme {{in the event of}} a crisis. Both the number and amount of market adjustments should be carried out in a flexible manner, depending on the market situation. Based on the calculated milk production costs, a target price range is defined in which the average European milk producer price should move. This system requires the introduction of both a basic volume and <b>supply</b> <b>rights.</b> Depending on the market situation, <b>supply</b> <b>rights</b> amounting to 3 - 5 percent of the existing (basic) <b>supply</b> <b>rights</b> will be granted to or withdrawn from dairy farmers. As an additional intervention measure, a remunerated scheme for the voluntary suspension of production in the tendering or bidding process should be implemented, together with strategic storage. The costs of the instruments are to be covered from a market regulation fund Furthermore, in order for this system to function, the existing regulation on protection at the EU 2 ̆ 019 s external borders on the basis of the Uruguay Round must be maintained (Fink-Ke A 2013).

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} the rationality of an <b>exclusive</b> <b>supply</b> contract for Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) between {{one of the}} two largest aircraft manufacturers in the world, Boeing, and a Japanese CFRP supplier, Toray. It appears irrational that in 2004 Boeing dared to choose Toray as the sole CFRP supplier for their new B 787 aircraft, and exclude other CFRP suppliers for the next 18 years, instead of letting several suppliers compete on price. On the basis of game theory, we build a mathematical model of the market for CFRP comprising Toray and the oligopolistic market for aircraft, assuming the other huge aircraft manufacturer, Airbus, as Boeing's rival. Consequently, we derive subgame perfect Nash equilibria using backward induction and observe its outcome. The results show that under specific conditions, such a contract can be a rational strategy by both companies, Boeing and Toray. In the model, an aircraft is defined as a product consisting of two materials, CFRP and aluminum. Two decision stages about production by Boeing and Airbus are done sequentially. In each stage, the amount of CFRP is first determined by the market and then the manufacturer determines the amount of aluminum. However, in advance of this stage Toray has been given a chance to propose the amount of CFRP for the case of <b>exclusive</b> <b>supply.</b> In order to be chosen as the exclusive supplier, Toray should propose the total amount of CFRP which are produced by both suppliers in the Cournot competitive market. It implies that Toray has an incentive to discount the price of CFRP from desirable price for purely monopolized market. Thus, designating a supplier as the exclusive one is rational action for manufacturers because it creates the possibility to make the price of material lower...|$|R

50|$|The {{products}} and services offered by the fine chemical industry fall into two broad categories: (1) “Exclusives”, a.k.a. custom manufacturing (CM) and (2) “standard” or “catalogue” products. “Exclusives”, provided mostly under contract research or custom manufacturing arrangements, prevail in business with life science companies; “standards” prevail in other target markets. Service-intense custom manufacturing (CM) constitutes the most prominent activity of the fine chemical industry. CM is the antonym of outsourcing. In custom manufacturing, a specialty-chemicals company outsources the process development, pilot plant, and, finally, industrial-scale production of an active ingredient, or a predecessor thereof, to one, or a few, fine chemical companies. The intellectual property of the product, and generally also the manufacturing process, stay with the customer. The customer-supplier relationship is governed by an <b>exclusive</b> <b>supply</b> agreement.
