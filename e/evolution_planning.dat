The approach emphasizes the analysis of evolution paths, driven by specific user requirements, and evolution modes, i. e., the infrastructure required to support the evolution paths. The objective is to determine the near-term actions that must be taken to protect the future options. These include the identification of evolution 'hooks and scars' on the baseline Space Station and the establishment of an evolution advanced development program. The near term emphasis of the <b>evolution</b> <b>planning</b> is on methods of increasing the efficiency and productivity of the Space Station and on requirements to support new initiatives currently being studied by NASA...|$|E
40|$|Software {{architecture}} {{allows us}} to make many decisions about a software system and analyze it even before it has been implemented, {{so as to make}} planned development possible. Similarly, architecture-based software <b>evolution</b> <b>planning</b> makes planned evolution possible by allowing us to make many decisions about the evolution of a software system and to analyze its evolution at the level of architecture design before software evolution is realized. In this paper, we develop a framework for architecture-based software <b>evolution</b> <b>planning.</b> It is done by defining various foundational terms and concepts, providing a taxonomy of software evolution plans, and then showing how to calculate values for various types of plans. By identifying and defining constituent foundational concepts, this conceptual framework makes precise the notion of ‘architecture-based software planning’. By developing a value-calculation framework for software evolution plans, it also provides a basis for concret...|$|E

40|$|Companies {{successfully}} applying {{product line}} approaches often follow a long-term strategy {{and need to}} plan product portfolios years ahead. For instance in the automotive industry, managers constantly make decisions about future product evolution, like the LED tail lights will be introduced with the next facelift and the LED front lights two years later". With a raising number of features, feature changes, and evolution steps, a systematic approach for <b>evolution</b> <b>planning</b> becomes essential. However, there is only very little support for such evolution in model-based product line engineering so far. This paper presents an approach for extending modeldriven product line engineering towards automated and toolsupported techniques for product line evolution.

The present paper suggests a new assessment oriented model that takes into consideration all facets of each external quality feature. The proposed model, named RatQual, gives a hierarchical categorization for quality. RatQual is designed to quantify dependent-environment qualities by considering internal, external and in use aspects. This model is supported by a tool that automates the assessment process. This tool gives assistance in quality <b>evolution</b> <b>planning</b> and serves for periodical monitoring operations used to enhance and improve information system quality.

40|$|Cyber {{security}} {{is becoming more}} and more relevant with the advent of large-scale systems made of independent and autonomous constituent systems that interoperate to achieve complex goals. To ensure security of cyber-physical systems, it is important to analyze identified threats and their possible consequences. In case of smart grids as an example of a complex system, threats can result in power outages that damage the continuous supply of energy that is required from critical infrastructures. Therefore, city planners must take into account security requirements when organizing the power grid, including demand-side management techniques able to mitigate the adverse effects of outages, ultimately improving grid resilience. This paper presents a modeling framework developed within the IRENE project that brings together methodologies, policies and a toolset to evaluate and measure the resilience of the targeted smart grid. This will support stakeholders and city planners in their activities, specifically the resilient <b>evolution</b> <b>planning</b> of Smart Grids...|$|E

40|$|Product line {{engineering}} (PLE) needs to consider <b>evolution</b> and strategic <b>planning</b> of <b>evolution</b> steps {{right from the}} beginning. If evolution is not taken care of, the benefits of model-driven PLE (e. g., productivity gains, strategic reuse, complexity handling) {{will be difficult to}} achieve. In this paper we propose an approach for strategic planning and management of feature model evolution. Our approach includes a modelling framework that describes evolutionary changes of product lines using extended feature mod-els (called EvoFM), <b>evolution</b> <b>plans,</b> and fragments of models. Different versions of a feature model along the evolution path are considered to be “products ” that can be configured using the EvoFM. By using feature mod-els to document the <b>evolution</b> <b>plan</b> of feature models, we demonstrate an elegant solution to dealing with long term planning of changes to feature models. 1...|$|R

Though {{it is the most}} difficult sector in the Spanish economy to promote its involvement in research and innovation activities, i. e. because of having the lowest investing activity on the area, its atomisation, the use of ‘low-tech’ technologies and presence of dozens of public technological centres and research organisms; the work carried out confirms that enterprises prospered since they are based on the Social Learning Model, framed in the <b>Evolution</b> <b>Planning</b> Theory developed by Prof. Friedmann. The work includes a review of the academic doctrine on the economical effects of research and technology; an analysis of the Agri-Food R&D+I systems in USA, Holland, France and Spain.

40|$|Abstract. Software <b>evolution</b> <b>planning</b> {{involves}} a {{decision making process}} about which changes should be introduced and when. This process is informed by knowledge relating to the existing product and its environment. There will be new enhancements as well as corrections to known problems. There is also knowledge of operational risks in the system that could manifest as problems {{at some time in}} the future. To counter these, risk reduction actions may be recommended. These can be treated as candidate system changes, with their own costs and possibly extra benefits. Any system changes will also carry with them development risks. To mitigate these further risk reduction actions may be formulated, again with an associated cost. However, there is typically a limited budget for the next release of the software. This constraint, along with that of inter-dependencies between candidate changes and taking account of the stakeholders varying attitude to risk means that there is a complex decision to be made. Using the fact that systems changes are estimable in terms of cost and benefit and that risks are estimable in terms of probability and potential impact cost, an approach is described that combines software evolution with risk management, incorporating simulation and genetic algorithms to support the decision making process. The method links product and project management and provides support for those involved in planning system evolution and is evaluated here using a sample project. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{permanently}} manned presence in space {{has been recognized}} by the United States and its international partners for many years. The development of this capability was delayed due to the concurrent recognition that reusable earth-to-orbit transportation was also needed and should be developed first. While {{the decision to go}} ahead with a permanently manned Space Station was on hold, requirements {{for the use of the}} Station were accumulating as ground-based research and the data from unmanned spacecraft sparked the imagination of both scientists and entrepreneurs. Thus, by the time of the Space Station implementation decision in the early 1980 's, a variety of disciplines, with a variety of requirements, needed to be accommodated on one Space Station. Additional future requirements could be forecast for advanced missions that were still in the early planning stages. The logical response was the development of a multi-purpose Space Station with the ability to evolve on-orbit to new capabilities as required by user needs and national or international decisions, i. e., to build an evolutionary Space Station. Planning for evolution is conducted in parallel with the design and development of the baseline Space Station. <b>Evolution</b> <b>planning</b> is a strategic management process to facilitate change and protect future decisions. The objective is not to forecast the future, but to understand the future options and the implications of these on today's decisions. The major actions required now are: (1) the incorporation of evolution provisions (hooks and scars) in the baseline Space Station; and (2) the initiation of an evolution advanced development program...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the problem of}} runway incursions at the (OEP- 35) U. S. towered airports. According to the FAA Runway Safety Report (2004), vehicle deviations accounted for 20 % (291 events) of all runway incursions {{during the period of}} 2000 through 2003. The focus of this quantitative correlational study is whether demographic characteristics are a significant factor in the airport movement area driver training that employees receive at Operational <b>Evolution</b> <b>Plan</b> (OEP- 35) US towered airports. Airport driver training officials at the OEP- 35 airports were surveyed using a five-point Likert-type survey. The data from this study suggested that demographic characteristics are significant factors in the airport driver training that employees receive at Operational <b>Evolution</b> <b>Plan</b> (OEP- 35) US towered airports, and vary by geographic region, as well as ethnic and cultural influences prevalent in each region. The data from this study may assist airport operators in identifying significant demographic characteristics that affect the outcomes of their driver training programs, and potential improvements that may enhance airport movement area driver training programs in various geographic regions...|$|R
