40|$|We {{consider}} as endogenous {{the choice of}} the delegation' rule in a political integration process between two countries. We study three potential types of delegation: strong, weak or no delegation, this last case corresponding to a referendum. We show that populations decide to bind themselves by delegating the national policy decision to a "powerfull conservative representative", in order to improve their bargaining position. These non-cooperative behaviors of countries when they decide on their delegation rule induce negative political externalities between countries, which cancel the gains achieved by the internalization of economic externalities in the case of political integration. We then propose two extensions. First, we assume a pre-play game where the countries choose whether or not to initiate political integration. Secondly, we examine the consequences of ratification by referendum. We conclude that a Pareto improvement of the political integration process would be to specify within the international treaty itself the means for its ratification; more precisely, to incorporate a formal ratification procedure, corresponding to an ex post referendum. <b>Delegation,</b> International <b>Agreements,</b> Nash Bargaining Solution, Political Integration, Ratification, Referendum...|$|R

Electronic Commerce (EC) poses new challenges in the areas of Knowledge Representation (KR) and Formal Modeling. Indeed, a specific agent architecture is necessary as the basis for a more constructive approach to the problem which, in this work, will be based on the Experience-Based Mediator (EBM) agent concept. Argument-based negotiation among agents has much to gain from the use of logical mechanisms. Although logic has been successfully used in the areas of argumentation (specially, legal argumentation), the reasoning process that happens before such argumentation is rarely stated. In EC scenarios, such process takes into account features such as temporality, priorities, <b>delegation,</b> gratitude and <b>agreement,</b> leading to a feasible EC system...|$|R

On the other hand, the information society requires the development of new and more intelligent methods, tools and theories to analyse, define, model and specify agent-based systems. It is under this presupposition that in this work are introduced a pre-argumentative reasoning scheme, which {{need to be able to}} take into account, in a negotiation, factors such as temporality, priority, <b>delegation,</b> gratitude and <b>agreement,</b> enabling the agents to react and pro-act accordingly. This argument-based negotiation among agents has much to gain from the use of Extended Logic Programming and Incomplete Information, in terms of the argument’s evaluation. Indeed, it is based on this substratum that are presented the bases for a pre-contract negotiation via argumentation, where pre-contract negotiation will be defined as a protocol which, once enforced, will allow the exchange of messages containing proposals, counter-proposals, critiques, justifications or even explanations. The terms of a negotiation are also set, adjusting the contract according to the agent’s knowledge base. In fact, an important contribution of this work relies on the presentation of the basic definitions and the general model of pre-contract-based negotiations via argumentation...|$|R

In particular the Indonesian delegations were indignant at having to cover what it saw as the costs of Dutch military action against it. Finally, thanks to the intervention of the US member of the UN Commission on Indonesia, the Indonesian side came to realise that agreeing to pay part of the Dutch debt would be the price they would {{have to pay for the}} transfer of sovereignty. On 24 October, the Indonesian delegations agreed that Indonesia would take over approximately 4.3 billion Guilders of Dutch East Indies government debt.|$|R
