40|$|City authorities, {{community}} groups and retrofit installers {{need to identify}} suitable local areas and dwellings for installing energy retrofit measures. This paper presents a localised Geographical Information System (GIS) based approach that utilises publicly-available national and local datasets on housing and energy to provide targeted low carbon measures across UK cities. The study uses a rapid city-level energy assessment approach to spatially identify suitable neighbourhoods for particular retrofit measures, based on relative energy use and fuel poverty ratings. A GIS-based carbon mapping model (called DECoRuM) is then used to estimate energy use and potential for energy reduction on a house-by-house level. The improvement measures are aggregated to encourage bulk installations and drive <b>down</b> <b>installation</b> costs. To identify an appropriate neighbourhood case study area, publicly available datasets were assessed for the town of Bicester (Oxfordshire, UK), which included Ordnance Survey Mastermap, Energy Performance Certificate data (EPC) and sub-national energy statistics available at lower layer super output area (LSOA). When the EPC data for Bicester were compared with the sub-national statistics for Bicester, the average difference {{was found to be}} ~ 800 kWh. This is interesting as EPCs represent dwelling specific but modelled data whereas sub-national datasets represent actual but aggregated data. Superimposing the above datasets, a neighbourhood in southwest Bicester was selected as having the highest percentage of dwellings with energy consumption > 300 kWh/m 2 /yr (EPC), most dwellings in need of wall insulation (EPC), second highest mean total energy consumption (sub-national), and third highest percentage of fuel poor dwellings (sub-national). House-level energy assessment in the selected area using DECoRuM showed that a package based approach comprising fabric and heating system upgrade and solar PVs emerged as the most effective...|$|E

50|$|Banners {{are used}} in many {{business}} ventures, marketing to their potential audience. A number of British towns and cities have whole series of banners decorating their city centers, effectively advertising the town or its special features and attractions. Pre-printed banners, albeit commonly used, are simple and accessible. Banners can be printed in enormous formats, with {{a full range of}} rich colors. They can also be used in many different physical situations whether it be hanging from an existing fixture, fixed to a wall or even free standing. When an advertising banner is hung or suspended between posts, grommets or another method of attachment are necessary to prevent the banner from tearing or flying away. Aluminum grommets can be punched into the banner and used as secure entry points to tie the banner <b>down.</b> This <b>installation</b> method allows for more durable advertisements. Some vendors offer pre-installed grommets. Another common form of free standing banners are retractable displays.|$|R

With the oil revenues we could meet our entire budget and combat poverty, disease, and backwardness among our people. Another important consideration is that by {{the elimination of the}} power of the British company, we would also eliminate corruption and intrigue, by means of which the internal affairs of our country have been influenced. Once this tutelage has ceased, Iran will have achieved its economic and political independence. The Iranian state prefers to take over the production of petroleum itself. The company should do nothing else but return its property to the rightful owners. The nationalization law provide that 25% of the net profits on oil be set aside to meet all the legitimate claims of the company for compensation.

Successful management of invasive requires, at first, a {{quantitative assessment of}} invasion levels. Although European legislation has adopted an ambitious strategy against invasive species, {{there is still a}} lack of knowledge about their occurrence in quarries. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate occurrence rates of invasive plant species in limestone quarries throughout Wallonia (Southern Belgium) and identify high priority and emerging invasive plants for adapted management. During 2016 vegetation period, forty quarries were selected by stratified sampling, using abandoned and active quarries as strata. Within selected quarries, two-meter wide transects were established to cross all activity sectors. Transects were divided in 10 x 2 m plots, resulting in 2 % of total surface of each quarry being surveyed. Cover and number of individuals of invasive plants species were recorded in each plot. Species considered were those of Harmonia list (67 species), the reference at the Wallonia scale. More than 30 000 plots were surveyed. Results of our recent study are presented (occurrences rates by species, mean percentage cover per site). First results indicate that dominant invasive species originate from different introduction paths: (i) planted (Robinia pseudoacacia); (ii) ornamentals (Cotoneaster horizontalis) and (iii) spontaneous colonization (Senecio inaequidens) - and follow various invasion dynamics. We propose research and management methods to be directed towards limitation of top ten frequent species (e. g.

50|$|In 1969, Colonel Gaddafi orchestrated a coup in Libya, and duly {{took control}} of the country and proceeded, after negotiations, to close <b>down</b> British {{military}} <b>installations</b> located at El Adem and Tobruk, and additionally American installations located near Tripoli. This presented the UK with quite a dilemma as there were no suitably expansive areas to allow the British Army to undertake armoured warfare exercises on a suitably large scale in Europe.

In January 1972, the British Army Training Unit Suffield was formally established. In July, the first live rounds were fired by the 4th Royal Tank Regiment Battle Group. In 1981, the lease for Suffield was extended, and in 1991, the lease was again extended.

40|$|Seeking {{to play a}} {{pioneering}} role in climate protection, the European Union has decided to pursue a reduction of at least 20 % in greenhouse-gas emissions (on 1990 levels) by the year 2020. Moreover, Europe has declared its willingness to commit itself to emission reductions of 30 % {{over the same period}} if other developed countries commit themselves to similar targets and if developing countries also make an appropriate contribution. A fair distribution of the burden of emission reductions in Europe and a comprehensive package of climate protection measures in Germany could substantially reduce the cost of emission reductions for the German economy. If Germany succeeds at European level in pushing through a fair burden-sharing mechanism that takes into account the emission reductions achieved to date in the different member states, {{and at the same time}} implements a comprehensive package of climate protection measures at home, then climate protection costs can be kept low. It would be very difficult for Germany to achieve its reduction target only by shutting <b>down</b> nuclear <b>installations.</b> What are also needed, in particular, are increased exploitation of energy efficiency potentials, the further development of renewable energy sources, the improvement of the system of emissions trading, and the promotion of innovative energy technologies. If European burden-sharing were fairly distributed and if Germany were to exploit all its energy efficiency potentials, then, in order to achieve a 20 % reduction in current European emissions, Germany's climate protection costs would amount to total of around 1. 9 billion euro per annum up to 2020. In this case, Germany would have reduced its emissions by 31 % on 1990 levels.

Frequently visitors forgot to bring them back. Man Ray later remarked: [...] "Unnecessary to mention that the flashlights were pointed at the faces of the people rather than at the artworks themselves. As at every overcrowded vernissage, everyone wanted to know who else was around." [...] Some of the historians see the design of the main hall as a metaphor for the menaced situation of surrealism, mirrored in the harassment of the political situation before the war, as well as an outsized uterus as vade mecum against the deeper reasons for the crisis, which would originate in the paternalistic fixations of the whole epoch. Especially the biographer of Wolfgang Paalen, Andreas Neufert, represents the latter reading and wants to see the installation as a whole as symptom for an ideological shift inside surrealism away from Sigmund Freud´s rigid interpretation of the Oedipus complex towards Otto Rank´s theory of The Trauma of Birth with its recognition of the emotional nature of the child and its ties to the mother, which was represented at this time exclusively by Wolfgang Paalen and his wife, the poet Alice Rahon.|$|R
40|$|Above-The-Road (AbTR) radar is a {{new type}} of speed {{measurement}} device used in China for traffic speed enforcement. The antenna beamwidths in vertical and horizontal directions are critical parameters for AbTR radar because speed measurement accuracy partly depends on vertical beamwidth and speed measurement interference from adjacent lanes can be effectively minimized by appropriate choice of horizontal beamwidth. In this paper, the speed measurement principle of AbTR radar is introduced and the reason for field speed measurement error is presented. The speed measurement error is theoretically calculated in various combinations of different vertical beamwidths and possible installation angles. The requirement for horizontal beamwidth to operate with less interference from adjacent lanes is also theoretically laid <b>down</b> with different <b>installation</b> heights and angles. Field tests with three equal-distanced piezosensors each lane as triggering references have been performed on an AbTR radar sample with vertical beamwidth 5. 1 ° and horizontal beamwidth 5. 2 °.

Meanwhile, Deen's work in cutting more metal for the backsplash hits a snag when his angle grinder breaks <b>down.</b> The sink <b>installation</b> is further hampered by the fact that Simon had unwittingly also thrown out the sink's tiedowns three episodes ago along with the sink's instructions and template; they were finally given to Cory after Andrew had salvaged them from the garbage an episode ago, so that Cory could finally secure the sink in place.
