2500|$|In fact, the god (under {{the name}} Vetis) {{is placed in}} the last case (number 16) of the outer rim of the Piacenza Liver—before Cilens (Nocturnus), who ends (or begins in the Etruscan vision) the {{disposition}} of the gods. In Martianus Capella's division of heaven, he is found in region XV with the dii publici; as such, he numbers among the infernal (or antipodal) gods. The location of his two temples in Rome—near those of Jupiter (one on the Capitoline Hill, in the low between the arx and the Capitolium, between the two groves where the asylum founded by Romulus stood, the other on the Tiber Island near that of [...] Iuppiter Iurarius, later also known as temple of Aesculapius)—may be significant in this respect, along {{with the fact that he}} is considered the father of Apollo, perhaps because he was depicted carrying arrows. He is also considered to be the unbearded Jupiter. The dates of his festivals support the same conclusion: they fall on January 1, March 7 and May 21, the first date being the recurrence of the Agonalia, dedicated to Janus and celebrated by the king with the sacrifice of a ram. The nature of the sacrifice is debated; Gellius states capra, a <b>female</b> <b>goat,</b> although some scholars posit a ram. This sacrifice occurred rito humano, which may mean [...] "with the rite appropriate for human sacrifice". Gellius concludes by stating that this god is one of those who receive sacrifices so as to persuade them to refrain from causing harm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Twelve <b>female</b> <b>goats</b> {{were used}} in a 90 day trial to {{study the effects of}} dietary energy supplementation to grazing on feed intake, growth and {{reproductive}} performance of <b>female</b> <b>goats.</b> Animals were blocked according to live weight and blocked groups were assigned at random into three feeding regimes i. e. low, medium and high energy (10. 02, 11. 06 and 11. 98 MJ ME/kg DM). Each goat received 250 grams of supplemental diet in addition to grazing. Results showed that, daily average dry matter and crude protein intake significantly (P 0. 05) irrespective of level of energy supplementation. Average daily live weight gain increased (P> 0. 05) in a linear fashion and the mean values were 37. 7, 44. 4 and 52. 9 g/d for low, medium and high energy supplemented diets respectively.
