40|$|Introduction and Overview The goal of {{automatic}} programming is to create, in an automated way, {{a computer program}} that enables a computer to solve a problem. Ideally, an automatic programming system should require that the user pre-specify {{as little as possible}} about the problem environment.

The size and shape of the solution should be part of the answer provided by an automated machine learning technique, rather than part of the question supplied by the human user.
