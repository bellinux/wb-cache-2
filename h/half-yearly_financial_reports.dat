This study examines equity of access by identifying the <b>half-yearly</b> <b>financial</b> information, if any, voluntarily mailed out by Australian listed entities and associated stakeholder characteristics. We find that certain stakeholder characteristics (presence of audit committee and shareholder dispersion) are associated with voluntary mail-out of <b>half-yearly</b> <b>financial</b> information, along with certain control variables (size of entity, industry and audit opinion). This study further identifies that {{there are very few}} instances of the higher level of assurance (audit) being chosen, and where half-year information is disseminated there are very few instances of the level of assurance on this information being communicated to shareholders.

40|$|The current {{economic}} and financial crisis has had a very relevant impact upon companies worldwide. This paper aims at investigating effects produced upon the financial statements of a sample of 90 Italian listed companies with specific reference to the intangible assets and goodwill, which are in many cases crucial for listed companies’ performance and evaluation. Specifically, goodwill should reflect the forecast on future trends and be, if necessary, written-off. This paper examines the trend exposed in the analysed 2007 - 2009 annual and <b>half-yearly</b> <b>financial</b> statements. Under a technical point of view, International <b>Financial</b> <b>Reporting</b> Standards (IFRS) should represent an appropriate basis to evaluate whether the mentioned crisis has been “converted” into accounting data, as they are naturally destined to satisfy investors’ information needs and should support decision makers to express their judgement on companies’ future profitability.

40|$|Harmonization of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> {{standards}} {{is a goal}} shared by many countries around the world, {{with the aim of}} making companies’ financial information comparable. The view is that comparability between companies’ <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> will result in greater transparency and more efficient capital markets and will improve the quality of the <b>financial</b> <b>reports.</b> A major step in this harmonization work is that more than 120 countries now follow International <b>Financial</b> <b>Reporting</b> Standards (IFRS). The fact that many countries today follow the same set of accounting standards means that harmonization has taken place at a de jure level, but it is unclear whether harmonized standards have also led to harmonization in practice (de facto harmonization). The aim of comparable financial information will be achieved only when the standards are applied consistently. The study investigates the factors that influence how individuals apply <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> standards in practice and whether conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> vary between individuals. The investigation consists of a study of annual reports from the years 1930 to 2012, as well as interviews with a number of individuals responsible for <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> within the Volvo Group. The interviews were then analyzed using the phenomenographic research method with a view to identifying the different qualitative conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> The areas of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> that were the focus of the study are revenue and provisions. In addition to factors identified in prior literature, a finding of the study is that a significant factor in the application of the {{standards is}} individuals’ conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> For example, this includes views on who is the primary user of financial information, the fundamental principles that form the basis for <b>financial</b> <b>reporting,</b> how standards have been designed and how individual transactions are to be reflected in the <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> Five qualitatively different ways of looking at <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> are identified, indicating that conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> have not developed in harmony with the standards. Older approaches to <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> exist in parallel with new influences from global standards.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relation}} between <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality and investment efficiency on a sample of 38, 062 firm-year observations between 1980 and 2003. <b>Financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality has been posited to improve investment efficiency, but to date {{there has been little}} empirical evidence to support this claim. Consistent with this claim, I find that proxies for <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality are negatively associated with both firm underinvestment and overinvestment. The relation between <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality and underinvestment (overinvestment) is mainly driven by the innate (innate and discretionary) component of <b>reporting</b> quality. Further, <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality is more strongly associated with overinvestment for firms with large cash balances and dispersed ownership, which suggests that <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality mitigates information asymmetries arising from agency conflicts.

40|$|Purpose - {{this paper}} aims {{to focus on}} a number of {{unexpected}} disclosures by major Australian banks, to highlight the subjectivity of <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> and their failure to present an accurate portrayal of the underlying realities, and to propose that corporate governance disclosures are required to provide reassurance that <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> are trustworthy. Design/methodology/approach - Moouck's institutional framework of financial regulation portrays <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> as a "game" played within a set of rules. It provides insights about the subjectivity of <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> which are iillustrated with archival evidence from banks' reports and activities. Findings - The banks' <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> were shown, in the light of later revelations, to portray an unrealistic view of their operations. Disclosures about corporate governance practices play a strong legitimising role, enhancing perceptions that <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> correspond with organisational realities. Research limitations/implications - This study considers a narrow population of companies within one industry. By extending the focus, greater evidence could be provided that accountings tandards and <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> requirements have lost their connection with business practices. Practical implications - In spite of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> reforms, <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> are becoming less reflective of companies' activities and performance. This questions the usefulness of accounting standards, and the effectiveness of regulatory systems. Future reforms to accounting standards need to address these issues.
