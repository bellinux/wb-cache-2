Framlingham Castle escaped the slighting that occurred to many other English castles around this time.

40|$|Abstract We derive a {{generalized}} Bell inequality for N qubits which involves an arbitrary number of settings <b>for</b> each of <b>the</b> local measuring apparatuses. The inequality forms {{a necessary condition}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> existence of a local realistic model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> a correlation function, given in a n-setting Bell experiment. We show that a local realistic model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> a correlation function, given in a two-setting Bell experiment, cannot construct a local realistic model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> a correlation function, given in an arbitrary number of n-setting Bell experiment, even though there exist two-setting models <b>for</b> <b>the</b> n measurement directions chosen in the given n-setting experiment. Therefore, the property of two-setting model {{is different from the}} property of n-setting model. We discuss classification of local realistic theories in further detail more than the result presented in (J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 41 : 155308, 2008).

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown that an {{explicit}} local realistic model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> a correlation function, given in a two-setting Bell experiment (two-setting model), works only <b>for</b> <b>the</b> specific set of settings in the given experiment, but cannot construct a local realistic model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> a correlation function, given in a continuous-infinite settings Bell experiment (infinite-setting model), even though there exist two-setting models for all directions in space. Hence, the two-setting model does not have the property which the infinite-setting model has. Here, we show that an explicit two-setting model cannot construct a local realistic model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> a correlation function, given in an only discrete-three settings Bell experiment (three-setting model), even though there exist two-setting models <b>for</b> <b>the</b> three measurement directions chosen in the given three-setting experiment.

At the end of the century, the inner bailey was finally cleared of most of its buildings; the new lodgings were pulled down, along with most of the west range and the old Norman chapel, leaving only the ruined keep, alongside the latrines and the newer chapel, although what these last two were then used for is uncertain.
