5|$|Although {{best known}} as Night of January 16th, the play's title changed {{multiple}} times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand's working title was Penthouse Legend. When Clive picked up the play, he thought Rand's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons. The play was called The Verdict during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals, but opened there with the title Woman on Trial. When Woods took the play to Broadway, he insisted on a new title. He offered Rand a choice between The Black Sedan and Night of January 16th. Rand liked neither, but picked the latter. Woods later suggested two more name changes, but did not implement them. Prior to the opening, he considered renaming the play The Night <b>is</b> <b>Young.</b> After the play opened, he considered changing its name each day to match the current date.|$|E
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is a very}} {{bold and}} {{assertive}} wine that has potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes. The wine's high tannin content {{as well as the}} oak influences and high alcohol levels associated with many regional styles play important roles in influencing how well the wine matches with different foods. When Cabernet Sauvignon <b>is</b> <b>young,</b> all those elements are at their peak, but as the wine ages it mellows; possibilities for different food pairings open up. In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) of the wine to the heaviness of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to hotness levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating the bitterness of the tannins. Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due to their ability to minimize the perception of tannins—such as in the classic pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon with steak au poivre and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.|$|E
5|$|Carménère wine has a {{deep red}} color and aromas found in red fruits, spices and berries. The tannins are gentler and softer than those in Cabernet Sauvignon {{and it is a}} medium body wine. As a result many find it can be drunk easily with fish. Although mostly used as a {{blending}} grape, wineries do bottle a pure varietal Carménère which, when produced from grapes at optimal ripeness, imparts a cherry-like, fruity flavor with smoky, spicy and earthy notes and a deep crimson color. Its taste might also be reminiscent of dark chocolate, tobacco, and leather. The wine is best to drink while it <b>is</b> <b>young.</b>|$|E

50|$|Sun Huan {{had three}} sons: Sun Cheng, Sun Yi and Sun Feng. Sun Yi {{was born to}} Sun Huan's {{concubine}} and <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> than Sun Cheng. Sun Feng <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> than Sun Yi. Sun Huan also had two daughters who <b>were</b> <b>younger</b> than Sun Yi. One of the daughters married Teng Yin while the other married Lü Ju.|$|R
50|$|Norwegians in North Dakota <b>are</b> <b>younger</b> {{than the}} average {{population}}. 13.8% of the population <b>is</b> <b>younger</b> than 18 years old, while {{the state as a}} whole is 10.3%.|$|R
5|$|Other species also migrate shorter {{distances}} {{away from}} the breeding sites, their distribution at sea determined by the availability of food. If oceanic conditions are unsuitable, seabirds will emigrate to more productive areas, sometimes permanently if the bird <b>is</b> <b>young.</b> After fledging, juvenile birds often disperse further than adults, and to different areas, so are commonly sighted far from a species' normal range. Some species, such as the auks, {{do not have a}} concerted migration effort, but drift southwards as the winter approaches. Other species, such as some of the storm petrels, diving petrels and cormorants, never disperse at all, staying near their breeding colonies year round.|$|E
5|$|The {{style of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is {{strongly}} influenced by the ripeness of the grapes at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon <b>is</b> <b>young,</b> the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. The aroma of blackcurrants {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} <b>is</b> <b>young</b> and predominantly rural, with a density {{among the}} highest in Africa. Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the Banyarwanda, although within this group there are three subgroups: the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people descended from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social castes within a single people, while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is Kinyarwanda, spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as official languages. Rwanda has a presidential system of government. The president is Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), who took office in 2000. Rwanda today has low corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by an ordered administrative hierarchy since pre-colonial times; there are five provinces delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament.|$|E

25|$|From a {{geological}} standpoint, the Ohio River <b>is</b> <b>young.</b> The river {{formed on}} a piecemeal basis beginning between 2.5 and 3million years ago.

The modern Ohio River flows within segments of the ancient Teays. The ancient rivers were rearranged or consumed by glaciers and lakes.|$|E
