25|$|Cyclura ricordi, {{commonly}} known as the Hispaniolan ground iguana, Ricord's ground iguana, Ricord's <b>iguana,</b> or Ricord's <b>rock</b> <b>iguana,</b> is a critically endangered species of <b>rock</b> <b>iguana.</b> It is found on the island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and is the only known species of <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> to coexist with the rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta). Its natural habitat is dry savanna within three subpopulations in the southwestern Dominican Republic. It is threatened by habitat loss due to agricultural encroachment.|$|R
50|$|The Allen Cays <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> or Allen Cays iguana (Cyclura cychlura inornata) is an {{endangered}} subspecies {{of the northern}} Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> that is found on Allen's Cay in the Bahamas. Its status is Endangered, with a wild population of 1,000 animals, {{and it can be}} found on the IUCN Red List.|$|R
2500|$|Cyclura is a genus of lizards in {{the family}} Iguanidae. Member species of this genus are {{commonly}} known as [...] "cycluras" [...] or more commonly as <b>rock</b> <b>iguanas</b> and only occur on islands in the West Indies. <b>Rock</b> <b>iguanas</b> have a high degree of endemism, with a single species or subspecies restricted to individual islands.|$|R
50|$|Like all Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguanas,</b> {{this species}} is {{protected}} in the Bahamas under the Wild Animals Protection Act of 1968. In May 2012, Island Conservation and the Bahamas National Trust {{worked together to}} remove invasive house mice from Allen Cay to protect native species including the Allen Cay <b>Rock</b> <b>Iguana,</b> Audubon's Shearwater, and the Bahama Yellowthroat.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} <b>rock</b> <b>iguanas,</b> their habitat is in rapid decline due to {{development}} and logging.|$|R
500|$|The Cuban <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura nubila), {{also known}} as the Cuban ground iguana [...] or Cuban iguana, is a species of lizard of the iguana family. It is the largest of the West Indian <b>rock</b> <b>iguanas</b> (genus Cyclura), one of the most {{endangered}} groups of lizards. This herbivorous species with red eyes, a thick tail, and spiked jowls {{is one of the largest}} lizards in the Caribbean.|$|R
5000|$|The Allen Cays <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> {{is a large}} <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> which attains a {{total length}} of close to 1.5 meters. [...] Its {{coloration}} is dark-gray to black, with yellowish green or orange tinged scales on the legs, dorsal crest, and the head. When the animal matures, the yellow coloration changes to a bright reddish orange color {{in contrast to the}} animals darker striped body and black feet.|$|R
50|$|The Cuban <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura nubila), {{also known}} as the Cuban ground iguana or Cuban iguana, is a species of lizard of the iguana family. It is the largest of the West Indian <b>rock</b> <b>iguanas</b> (genus Cyclura), one of the most {{endangered}} groups of lizards. This herbivorous species with red eyes, a thick tail, and spiked jowls {{is one of the largest}} lizards in the Caribbean.|$|R
50|$|Like all Cyclura species, the Turks and Caicos <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> is {{primarily}} herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, and fruits from over 58 different plant species. This diet is very rarely supplemented with insects, mollusks, crustaceans, arachnids, lizards, and carrion. It {{has been noted}} that in captivity, it eats both animal and plant food. Gerber and Iverson write that the Turks and Caicos <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> may live at least 20 years.|$|R
5000|$|Cyclura rileyi, {{commonly}} known as the Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> or the San Salvador <b>rock</b> <b>iguana,</b> is a critically endangered species of lizard native to three island groups in the Bahamas. The species is in decline due to habitat encroachment by human development and predation by feral dogs and cats. There are three subspecies: the Acklins ground iguana (Cyclura rileyi nuchalis), the White Cay iguana (Cyclura rileyi cristata), in addition to the nominotypical subspecies (Cyclura rileyi rileyi [...] ).|$|R

50|$|The Turks and Caicos <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> inhabits small cays, but {{has been}} reduced to less than 5% of its {{original}} range largely due to the introduction of predators.|$|R
25|$|Like other herbivorous lizards, the <b>rock</b> <b>iguanas</b> are {{presented}} with a special problem for osmoregulation: plant matter contains more potassium and has less nutritional content per gram than meat so more must be eaten to meet the lizard's metabolic needs. Unlike mammals, reptile kidneys cannot concentrate urine to save on water intake. Instead reptiles excrete toxic nitrogenous wastes as solid uric acid through their cloaca. In {{the case of the}} <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> which consumes large amounts of vegetation, these excess salt ions are excreted through their salt gland {{in the same manner as}} birds.|$|R
5000|$|The Allen Cays <b>rock</b> <b>iguana,</b> Cyclura cychlura inornata, is {{endemic to}} Leaf Cay and {{southwest}} Allen's Cay {{in the northern}} Exuma Island chain in the Bahamas. [...] It {{is one of three}} subspecies of the Northern Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguana,</b> the others being the Andros Island iguana (Cyclura cychlura cychlura) and the Exuma Island iguana (Cyclura cychlura figginsi). [...] Its generic name (Cyclura) is derived from the Ancient Greek cyclos (κύκλος) meaning [...] "circular" [...] and ourá (οὐρά) meaning [...] "tail", after the thick-ringed tail characteristic of all Cyclura species.|$|R

5000|$|The San Salvador <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> is an {{endangered}} species of lizard of the genus Cyclura in the family Iguanidae. First described by Leonhard Stejneger in 1903, it is known commonly in the Bahamas as simply [...] "iguana".|$|R
5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of Cyclura nubila are the Grand Cayman blue iguana (Cyclura lewisi) and the Northern Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura cychlura); phylogenetic analysis indicates that these three species diverged {{from a common}} ancestor three million years ago.|$|R
50|$|Like all Cyclura species, the {{northern}} Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> is primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers and fruits from over 100 different plant species. This diet is very rarely supplemented with insect larvae, crabs, slugs, dead birds and fungi.|$|R
50|$|Popular meat {{dishes are}} made with chicken, pork, and goat (also {{referred}} to as mutton). Iguana is still hunted and eaten, especially in the outlying islands, although some species, such as the Northern Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguana,</b> are endangered.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} home to the native Turks & Caicos <b>Rock</b> <b>Iguana</b> (Cyclura carinata) which is {{critically}} endangered. The San Diego Zoo has been working to capture, relocate, and the subsequent examination of homing abilities to assess the viability of relocation.|$|R
50|$|Its closest {{relatives}} are the Cuban iguana (Cyclura nubila) and the Northern Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura cychlura), the three species having diverged {{from a common}} ancestor some three million years ago. The species has a low genetic diversity but {{does not seem to}} suffer the same lack of vitality that afflicts other such species of <b>rock</b> <b>iguana.</b> One theory is that the species evolved from a single female Cuban iguana (C. nubila nubila) with eggs inside her who drifted across the sea, perhaps during a storm. It is distinct from the subspecies found on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac known as C. nubila caymanensis, although it can breed with this subspecies and produce fertile offspring.|$|R
2500|$|Ricord's iguana {{is a large}} {{species of}} <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> with a head and body length in males of , and in females of , with an equally long tail. The toes of Ricord's iguana [...] are {{articulated}} to be efficient in digging and climbing trees.|$|R

50|$|Like all Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguanas,</b> {{this species}} is {{protected}} in the Bahamas under the Wild Animals Protection Act of 1968.

50|$|The Turks and Caicos <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> dwells {{in rocky}} areas and sandy {{habitats}} as sand {{is required for}} nesting. The Turks and Caicos iguana is diurnal and spends {{the night in the}} burrows it has dug or in natural retreats in or under the rocks.|$|R
