Having purchased the site, Parkview started work on a £1.1billion project to restore the building and to redevelop the site into a retail, housing and leisure complex.|$|E
5|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} bid to become Lord Mayor of Sydney that saw him {{defeated by the}} Labor Party's Pat Hills, Waddy {{was elected to the}} New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Liberal member for the newly created seat of Kirribilli, on Sydney's North Shore, in March 1962. He sold his interest in JohnL. Waddy Pty Ltd the same year. Appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education in 1967, he was an Assistant Minister from February 1969 until March 1971, when he became a Minister of the Crown in charge of Child Welfare and Social Welfare in Premier Robert Askin's cabinet, succeeding Frederick Hewitt. His portfolio included responsibility for Aboriginal affairs; in 1972 he founded the Aboriginal Lands Trust, staffed by a council of nine elected Indigenous Australians, to assume <b>freehold</b> <b>title</b> of former government reserves in New South Wales as a precursor to granting land rights.|$|E

25|$|Harry Johnston was {{appointed}} {{as the first}} Commissioner of the British Central Africa Protectorate in July 1891. Johnston did not consider that the Crown had a general claim to sovereignty over any land unless it had been expressly transferred by cession. Without sovereignty, the Crown {{had no right to}} alienate that land. However, some treaties made after July 1891 did cede sovereignty over land, but granted the communities involved the right to retain any land that they actually occupied as Crown tenants, leaving any vacant land free for the Crown to alienate. He also accepted that the treaties and agreements made {{before the start of the}} protectorate might be evidence of sales of land. Even though he accepted that the land belonged to its African communities, not the chiefs, Johnston proposed the legal fiction that the people had given their chiefs the right to sell it. This interpretation validated the chiefs’ sales and grants of unused land to Europeans. He also claimed that he was entitled to investigate whether these sales were valid and, if they were, to issue Certificates of Claim (in effect a registration of <b>freehold</b> <b>title</b> over the land to the new owners.|$|E
500|$|Land tenure {{has been}} an issue since first {{settlement}} as island residents repeatedly requested <b>freehold</b> <b>title</b> or an absolute gift of cultivated land. Original settlers were squatters. The granting of a [...] lease to Richard Armstrong in 1878 drew complaints and a few short-term leases ("permissive occupancies") were granted. In 1913, with {{the appointment of a}} Board of Control, permissive occupancies were revoked and the Board itself given permissive occupancy of the island. Then the Lord Howe Island Act 1953 made all land the property of the Crown. Direct descendants of islanders with permissive occupancies in 1913 were granted perpetual leases on blocks of up to [...] for residential purposes. Short-term special leases were granted for larger areas used for agriculture, so in 1955, fifty-five perpetual leases and 43 special leases were granted. The 1981 amendment to the act extended political and land rights to all residents of 10 years or more. There remains an active debate concerning the proportion of residents with tenure and the degree of influence on the Board of resident islanders in relation to long-term planning for visitors, and issues relating to the environment, amenity and global heritage.|$|E

5000|$|However, the {{principle}} of the owner of land owning the minerals within it has been virtually abolished by statute in Australia [...] The general rule is that the Crown (in right of the State) owns all minerals. This has been implemented by statute; initially by enacting that all future grants of land must contain a reservation to the Crown of all minerals. Now, all new grants of <b>freehold</b> <b>titles</b> in Australia have provided that all minerals were reserved to the Crown.|$|R
2500|$|The PNG {{legislature}} has enacted laws {{in which a}} type of tenure called [...] "customary land title" [...] is recognised, meaning that the traditional lands of the indigenous peoples have some legal basis to inalienable tenure. This customary land notionally covers most of the usable land in the country (some 97% of total land area); alienated land is either held privately under state lease or is government land. <b>Freehold</b> <b>title</b> (also known as fee simple) can only be held by Papua New Guinean citizens.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{component}} of assimilation was homesteading. The Homestead Act of 1862, was {{signed into law}} by President Abraham Lincoln. The Act gave an applicant <b>freehold</b> <b>title</b> to an area called a [...] "homestead" [...] – typically 160 acres (65 hectares or one-fourth section) of undeveloped federal land. Within Indian Territory, as lands were removed from communal tribal ownership, a land patent (or first-title deed) was given to tribal members. The remaining land was sold on a first-come basis (typically by land run, with settlers also receiving a land patent type deed. For these now former Indian lands, the General Land Office distributed the sales funds to the various tribal entities, according to previously negotiated terms.|$|E
50|$|The hopes dashed by {{the matter}} of the Graces were {{compounded}} by Wentworth's subsequent policies in Ireland. Particularly, he then challenged the <b>freehold</b> <b>titles</b> of many Old English families in Connacht that could be rectified only by the payment of large fines. The ensuing ill-feeling contributed in part to the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and the establishment of Confederate Ireland that led on, ultimately, to the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649-53. For English political reasons, Wentworth was tried by parliament and executed in May 1641.|$|R
5000|$|One {{consequence}} of the Land Registration Act 1925 was that only estates in land (freehold or leasehold) could be registered. Land held directly by the Crown, known as property in the [...] "royal demesne", is not held under any vestigial feudal tenure (the crown has no historical overlord other than, for brief periods, the papacy) and there is therefore no estate to register. This had the consequence that freeholds which escheated to the Crown ceased to be registrable. This created a slow drain of property out of registration, amounting to some hundreds of <b>freehold</b> <b>titles</b> in each year.|$|R

2500|$|The Western Australian Cricket Association {{was officially}} {{established}} on 25 November 1885 under the Presidency of JCH James. In 1893, the WACA ground was officially opened, occupying {{a site of}} old swamp land {{to the east of}} the city. The association has a 999-year lease over the land (which expires in 2888). The long term of the lease means that, effectively, the association has <b>freehold</b> <b>title</b> (save that it cannot divest itself of any part of the land without the state government's consent). [...] Originally, the title covered 29 acres (117,000m²), and took in what is now Gloucester Park. However, {{the latter part of the}} land was divested to the Trotting Association in the early 1920s. In a curious twist, between 1977 and 1979, (then-rebel) World Series Cricket matches were played at Gloucester Park because the Kerry Packer-led organisation was not granted access to the WACA.|$|E
2500|$|Migrant {{settlers}} received {{financial assistance}} {{for them and}} their families passage to Australia, and in return were required to work in small communities in undeveloped areas in the State's South West and Wheatbelt regions. [...] After often only one or two days of acclimatisation and processing on arrival, properties were allocated by ballot and the settlers transported to their selections. [...] After a period of establishment, the settlers were required to repay a 30-year loan (not exceeding £1,000) provided by the Agricultural Bank, and at the completion of the loan repayment the settler would have <b>freehold</b> <b>title</b> to the property. [...] They were paid 10 shillings per day during the land clearing phase and offered a £10 loan for the purchase of household and agricultural equipment. [...] The loan was interest-only for the first five years. [...] The communities (or groups) typically comprised between twelve and twenty families, and cleared land, built fences and established their farms in areas which had previously been unable to attract settlers.|$|E
2500|$|The Fraser Government won two {{subsequent}} elections. Fraser maintained some of {{the social}} reforms of the Whitlam era, while seeking increased fiscal restraint. His government included the first Aboriginal federal parliamentarian, Neville Bonner, and in 1976, Parliament passed the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976, which, while limited to the Northern Territory, affirmed [...] "inalienable" [...] <b>freehold</b> <b>title</b> to some traditional lands. Fraser established the multicultural broadcaster SBS, welcomed Vietnamese boat people refugees, opposed minority white rule in Apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia and opposed Soviet expansionism. A significant program of economic reform however was not pursued and, by 1983, the Australian economy was in recession, amidst {{the effects of a}} severe drought. Fraser had promoted [...] "states' rights" [...] and his government refused to use Commonwealth powers to stop the construction of the Franklin Dam in Tasmania in 1982. A Liberal minister, Don Chipp had split off from the party to form a new social liberal party, the Australian Democrats in 1977 and the Franklin Dam proposal contributed to the emergence of an influential Environmental movement in Australia, with branches including the Australian Greens, a political party which later emerged from Tasmania to pursue environmentalism as well as left-wing social and economic policies.|$|E

40|$|A Geographical Society Magazine article. Since their inception, {{purchase}} {{areas have}} been part of the Rhodesian government's policy to separate African from European farming areas. The first purchase areas were created in the early 1930 's after the Land Apportionment Act had been passed. Up to that time Africans had been free to buy land outside tribal areas on the same conditions as Europeans. As some Africans made use of this right, some European farmers became concerned at the presence of African-owned farms in their neighborhood and demanded separation. But other Europeans were motivated by the desire to assist a greater number of progressive African farmers to obtain <b>freehold</b> <b>titles</b> to farms large enough to enable the owners to reap a significant surplus.

50|$|Easements in English law are rights within English {{land law}} that one {{individual}} has over another's land. Rights recognised as easements most frequently include {{rights of way}} or light, and extend {{as far as the}} right to use a neighbour's lavatory, or to park a car on their land. The necessity of easements can be recognised by the Law Commission's recent findings that there are easements over at least 65% of registered <b>freehold</b> <b>titles.</b> In some circumstances for example, it may be impossible for one land owner to access a public highway without an easement of a right of way.

Weeroona Island beach wraps around the western half of the 1 km wide island for 1.6 km, the eastern half being surrounded by mangroves. While detached from the mainland at high tide, at low tide it is linked by tidal flats. Road vehicle access is provided by a 300 m long causeway. Beaches border the southern, western and northern shore and generally consist of a narrow high tide beach. 20 shacks line the southern shore, and larger <b>freehold</b> <b>titles</b> are privately owned along the northern shore. Shorelines are backed by grassy slopes which rise to a 30 m high island crest. The beaches are fronted by a narrow strip of sand, behind which vegetated tidal flats extend for hundreds of metres north and south. The western side is an exception to this, where the spread of tidal flat vegetation is limited by the tidal channel.|$|R
40|$|This study explores how City of Johannesburg came {{to adopt}} its Regularization of Informal Settlements Programme with {{permission}} to occupy as a preferred tenure option. Firstly, the study examines tenure issues and debates around tenure including {{different forms of}} tenure. Secondly, it explores the policy shift in City of Johannesburg towards regularisation and what this entails. It further reviews international forms of tenure with reference to Brazil and Namibia. The study argues {{that there is a}} need for improved intervention strategies that allow informal settlements to be recognised as part of the city in a manner that would consider their livelihoods. It also argues that <b>freehold</b> <b>titling</b> is not necessarily the best form of tenure for informal settlement residents. The study concludes that there is an acute need to recognise informal settlements as part of the City. Furthermore, City of Johannesburg had insufficient funding which limited them in their Regularization of Informal Settlements Programme. The Development Facilitation Act 67 of 1995, The Less Formal Township Establishment Act 113 of 1991 and the amendment of City of Johannesburg Town Planning Scheme influenced the City in their approach to issuing permits. City of Johannesburg can draw lessons from City of Windhoek’s approach to informal settlements...|$|R
