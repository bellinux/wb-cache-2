50|$|The Court of Appeals was {{reestablished}} in 1859, {{again with}} three judges (this time, one chief judge and two associate judges). The procedure {{was a bit}} more complex this time around: the Court of Appeals could issue final judgments in both law and equity, but in cases where a constitutional question or conflict of laws issue was presented, the judges of the courts of law and equity would convene along with the Court of Appeals in a Court of Errors. The Court of Errors' decisions were <b>final</b> <b>and</b> <b>unappealable.</b>|$|R

How to Clean Record Act says that anyone who is convicted of a collective body, even though there is possibility of resources, will become ineligible, the justices opposed to the constitutionality of the law deemed that section of the legislation as unconstitutional. However, justice Ricardo Lewandowski said the presumption of innocence applies to criminal cases, not being wide enough to reach the text of the Clean Record.|$|R

Moreover, it is feared that the legislation hurts the principle of [...] "presumption of innocence", becoming ineligible innocent people.|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} appointments a president makes are those to the Supreme Court of the United States. 1 While cabinet members come and go, serving {{as they do}} {{at the pleasure of}} the president, federal judges serve for life, {{and in the case of}} Supreme Court justices, their decisions are <b>final</b> <b>and</b> <b>unappealable.</b> One scholar calls Supreme Court justiceships, "next to the presidency, the most eminent public office in the United States. " 2 Twenty-five years after the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt, two of his justices were still serving on the Supreme Court. In our history, the Senate has shown much less deference to presidents in Supreme Court nominations than it has to either cabinet posts or lower federal judgeships; the 19 percent rejection rate of Supreme Court nominees (through 1991) is the highest for any national office. 3 Senate confirmation fights are costly in terms of political capital, public relations, and time. 4 The goal for the president then, is to start with a nominee for the Court who can be confirmed with as little expense of political capital as necessary. The decision is also a very personal one for the president. "Far more than any other nominations to the federal bench, " Abraham writes, "those to the highest tribunal in the land are not only theoretically, but by and large actually, made with...|$|R

5000|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century the French clergy {{presented}} frequent memorials against the encroachments made by their kings and parliaments through constant recourse to these [...] "appeals as from an abuse", which resulted in submitting to civil tribunals questions of definitions of faith, the proper administration of the sacraments, and the like. This brought confusion into the regulation of spiritual matters by encouraging ecclesiastics to rebel against their lawful ecclesiastical superiors. The lay tribunals undertook to adjudicate whether the ministers of the sacraments {{had a right to}} refuse them to those deemed unworthy, or the right to Christian burial of Catholics dying impenitent or under Church censures; whether interdicts or suspensions were valid; whether monastic professions should be annulled; whether the bishop's permission was necessary for preaching; whether a specified marriage was contrary or not to the Gospel; and also to decide the justice of canonical privations of benefices. Many other subjects intimately connected with the teaching of the Church were brought before lay tribunals, <b>and</b> <b>unappealable</b> decisions rendered in open contradiction to the canons, as can easily be surmised both from the absence of theological knowledge, and from the visible animus shown in decisions that undertook to subject the spiritual power of the Church to the dictates of transient politics.|$|R
