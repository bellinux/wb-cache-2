5000|$|The de-asphalter unit {{is usually}} placed after the vacuum {{distillation}} tower. It {{is usually a}} solvent de-asphalter unit, SDA. The SDA separates the asphalt from the feedstock because light hydrocarbons will dissolve aliphatic compounds but not asphaltenes.

40|$|Abstract. A 1000 hour {{hydrotreating}} {{experiment was}} performed to investigate the hydrotreating behavior of heteroatom compounds (first stage) and HDM catalyst deactivation (second stage) using Venezuela <b>De-Asphalted</b> Oil. The effect of reaction severity on impurities removal was the expected one, the deeper the hydrotreating degree, the higher the conversion of impurities. The Characterization of spent HDM catalyst shows that the content of coke deposition on spent HDM catalyst is only 4 wt % while that of metal is more than 30 wt%. Vanadium compounds in DAO with less diffusion resistance can deposit inside of the HDM catalyst grain. Lower coke formation also retard the HDM catalyst by keeping the diffusion pores and active cites. The removal of asphaltenes largely improved {{the stability of the}} HDM catalyst...|$|R

5000|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the {{refinery}} began a long-range modernization and expansion of its facilities to accommodate the new post-war consumer demands for petroleum products. The refinery constructed units that increased production of highly refined products for the postwar generation of higher-compression engines. In 1951, a [...] residuum stripper was constructed to convert heavy residual fuel oil into lighter products. In 1959, the company made a major breakthrough when it developed the Isocracking process which uses catalysts to rearrange the existing molecules of heavy fuel oils to remove sulfur and convert low-value fuel oils into higher-yield products such as gasoline. The company also completed a new fluid catalytic cracking unit capable of processing [...] daily of feed stock, further adding to the high-octane gasolines being demanded in rapidly increasing quantities by modern, high-compression automobile engines. In 1965, a breakthrough came when the Richmond refinery opened the world's largest Isomax hydrocracking complex. The unit converts heavy petroleum oils to lighter stocks for gasoline and other higher valued products. The -a-day unit increased the plant's gasoline output by 40%. A solvent <b>de-asphalting</b> plant and a hydrogen manufacturing plant were also constructed to support the Isomax and were the largest of their kind ever constructed.|$|E

Dibenzothiophene (DBT) and benzo[b]naphtho[1, 2 -d]thiophene (BNT 1) were selected as model sulfur compounds. The {{results show that}} the mixed culture was able to grow by utilizing DBT and BNT 1 as the sole sulfur source, while the cell density was higher using DBT than BNT 1 as the sulfur source. GC-MS analysis of their desulfurized metabolites indicates that both DBT and BNT 1 could be desulfurized through the sulfur-specific degradation pathway with the selective cleavage of carbon-sulfur bonds. When DBT and BNT 1 coexisted, the biodesulfurization efficiency of BNT 1 decreased significantly as the DBT concentrations increased (> 0. 1 mmol/L). BNT 1 desulfurization efficiency also decreased along with the increase of 2 -hydroxybiphenyl as the end product of DBT desulfurization. For real bunker oil, only 2. 8 % of sulfur was removed without <b>de-asphalting</b> after 7 days of biotreatment. After <b>de-asphalting,</b> the biodesulfurization efficiency was significantly improved (26. 2 - 36. 5 %), which is mainly attributed to fully mixing of the oil and water due to the decreased viscosity of bunker oil.

30|$|Asphaltene {{precipitation}} and {{its effects}} on the concentration of oil is another factor that has to be considered in evaluating oil composition variation as a function of PVI. This factor could be eliminated by <b>de-asphalting</b> the crude oil and re-running all the experiments and this situation does not exist in the field for this crude. Therefore, our conclusion regarding extracted components is a preliminary one and further work is needed {{to come up with a}} definite conclusion on this mechanism.|$|E
30|$|The {{separation}} of residues into two fractions asphaltenes and maltenes is {{brought about by}} means of low molecular weight paraffinic hydrocarbons, which have been recognized as possessing selective solvency for hydrocarbon systems and is known as solvent <b>de-asphalting.</b> The precipitation of insolubles from petroleum is known to follow a complex mechanism involving solubility equilibria, adsorption, and aggregation. Thus, the amounts and nature of insolubles precipitated by different hydrocarbon solvents will be different. Ethyl acetate {{has been used to}} eliminate both resins and asphaltenes from the oil in one step and thus improving the quality of de-asphalted oil (Catellanos et al. 1983).|$|E
30|$|The {{evaluation}} {{of the decline in}} crude oil quality associated with biodegradation has become critical in recent years as offshore drilling has progressed into deeper water horizons. Biodegradation is the most alteration process in hydrocarbon reservoirs in many areas, in addition to a number of other alteration processes, such as water washing, phase separation, gravity segregation and <b>de-asphalting.</b> It gradually destroys oil spills and oil seeps by the sequential metabolism of various classes of compounds present in the oil (Bence et al. 1996). When biodegradation occurs in an oil reservoir, the process dramatically affects the fluid properties (Miiller et al. 1987) and hence the value and producibility of an oil accumulation. Specifically, oil biodegradation typically raises oil viscosity that reduces oil producibility and reduces the API gravity, which reduces the value of the produced oil. It also increases the asphaltene content relative to the saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon contents, concentration of certain metals and increases the sulfur content of the oil.|$|E
30|$|There {{are several}} {{features}} {{associated with the}} VAPEX process which make it attractive to the petroleum industry. First, VAPEX is carried out at reservoir temperature, and therefore, the heat loss does not occur. The energy requirements of a VAPEX project {{are estimated to be}} approximately 3  % of those for a SAGD project (Upreti et al. 2007). Second, some portion of the injected solvent can be recovered with the use of typical separation facilities (Butler et al. 1995). In addition, the initial capital expenditure for a VAPEX process can be substantially less than a thermal project. Third, VAPEX boasts several benefits over thermal processes on the environmental side. During a pressure blowdown for solvent recovery, a gas must be injected to occupy the void left by the recovered solvent. A greenhouse gas such as CO 2 can be used for this purpose. This allows for the geological storage of significant amounts of CO 2 (Luhning et al. 2003). CO 2 can also be included {{as a part of the}} solvent. Finally, one of the most attractive features of VAPEX is the in situ upgrading of the oil, which occurs through asphaltene precipitation, or <b>de-asphalting.</b> The viscosity of the oil is drastically reduced by the removal of these components (Luo and Gu 2005; Luo et al. 2007).|$|E
