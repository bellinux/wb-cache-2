A loss to Marshall University in that second-to-last game, however, put ECU into second place in its division, and thus out of {{competition}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> USA Championship. After winning against conference foe Tulane in the final game of the season, the Pirates decided to travel to the Hawaii Bowl.

5|$|To {{co-ordinate}} {{planning for}} the proposed genocide, Heydrich hosted the Wannsee Conference, which brought together administrative leaders of the Nazi regime on 20 January 1942. In preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference,</b> Eichmann drafted for Heydrich {{a list of the}} numbers of Jews in various European countries and prepared statistics on emigration. Eichmann attended the conference, oversaw the stenographer who took the minutes, and prepared the official distributed record of the meeting. In his covering letter, Heydrich specified that Eichmann would act as his liaison with the departments involved. Under Eichmann's supervision, large-scale deportations began almost immediately to extermination camps at Bełżec, Sobibor, Treblinka and elsewhere. The genocide was code-named Operation Reinhard in honour of Heydrich, who died in Prague in early June from wounds suffered in an assassination attempt. Kaltenbrunner succeeded him as head of the RSHA.|$|E

5|$|E. J. Mather {{coached the}} team to three Big Ten titles in his nine seasons as coach. After inheriting Mitchell's team, which he led to a 10–13 overall (3–9, Big Ten) record during the 1919–20 season, he led {{the team to}} an 18–4 overall (8–4, Big Ten) record during the 1920–21 season. This 1921 team won its first eight and last eight games to tie the Wisconsin Badgers and Purdue Boilermakers for the Big Ten title. The team won {{back-to-back}} championships in 1925–26 and 1926–27. The 1926 squad, which was captained by Richard Doyle who became the team's first All-American, tied with Purdue, the Iowa Hawkeyes and Indiana Hoosiers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> championship. The 1927 team had a new All-American, Bennie Oosterbaan, and won the school's first back-to-back championships and first outright championship with a 14–3 overall (10–2, Big Ten) record. Mather died after a lengthy battle with cancer in August 1928.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{states had}} already seceded when Breckinridge took his seat as a senator, leaving the {{remaining}} Southern senators more outnumbered in their defense of slavery. Seeking {{to find a}} compromise that would reunite the states under constitutional principles, he urged Lincoln to withdraw federal forces from the Confederate states in order to avert war. The congressional session ended on March 28, and in an April 2 address to the Kentucky General Assembly, he continued to advocate peaceful reconciliation of the states and proposed a conference of border states to seek a solution. On April 12, Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter, ending plans <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference.</b> Breckinridge recommended that Governor Beriah Magoffin call a sovereignty convention to determine whether Kentucky would side with the Union or the Confederacy. On May 10, he was chosen by the legislature as one of six delegates to a conference to decide the state's next action. The states' rights delegates were Breckinridge, Magoffin, and Richard Hawes; the Unionist delegates were Crittenden, Archibald Dixon, and S.S. Nicholas. Unable to agree on substantial issues, the delegates recommended that Kentucky adopt a neutral stance in the Civil War and arm itself to prevent invasion by either federal or Confederate forces. Breckinridge did not support this recommendation, but he agreed to abide by it once it {{was approved by the}} legislature.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after, Roberts {{joined his}} {{hometown}} club Northwich Victoria on another loan deal. He made his debut for Northwich in a 3–1 away win at St Albans City at Clarence Park, and after playing {{in three games}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> National side, Roberts signed for the club on a permanent basis. He featured regularly {{during the second half}} of the 2006–07 season, which witnessed an up-turn in form for Northwich. As a result, Roberts returned to the Football League with Accrington Stanley in July 2007, joining the club for a fee set by a tribunal. Roberts started the first 30 games for the League Two side, whilst featuring in a further three as a substitute. However, he returned to Northwich Victoria on loan in March 2008. He helped Northwich to Conference Premier survival towards the end of the season, scoring his only goal in a crucial match against fellow relegation candidates Stafford Rangers, and played a total of nine times during the loan spell. Despite making a further brief appearance for Accrington towards the end of the season, Roberts re-joined Northwich on a permanent deal after his loan spell. During the 2008–09 season, Roberts continued to play regularly in the centre of Northwich's defence, scoring once in a 3–2 home defeat against Weymouth in September 2008. He made a total of twenty appearances for Northwich during the first half of the season.|$|E

5|$|The {{opportunity}} arose to join York City in June 2007, {{and despite}} the efforts of Northwich chairman Mike Connett, Elliott signed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> Premier club, along with former Northwich teammate Paul Brayson, on 25 June. He was sent off during his York debut, a 2–1 home defeat by Cambridge United on 11 August 2007, which resulted in him receiving a three-match ban. He was also sent off on 12 April 2008 against Woking along with Tom Evans and Darren Craddock; this proved to be his final appearance for York. Having made 46 appearances and scored three goals for York, Elliott was released at the end of 2007–08, after which he was signed by Conference Premier club Grays Athletic on 7 May 2008. He was booked on his debut, a 3–1 away defeat by Weymouth on the opening day of 2008–09 on 9 August 2008, and picked up yellow cards in the two following matches. However, he scored a goal from 25yards in the third match on 16 August 2008, which finished as a 2–1 home victory against Northwich Victoria. He picked up a hernia injury, which required him to undergo surgery in December 2008. He was transfer listed by the club in January 2009, with financial pressures and manager Wayne Burnett's plans cited as the reason. Following the departure of Burnett, Elliott took the role of assistant manager at Grays, alongside Jamie Stuart. He made his return from injury in a 2–1 home win over Altrincham on 7 March 2009. Elliott finished the season with 29 appearances and two goals.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{began the}} month {{with a loss}} to Indiana on February 2. The team rebounded against Nebraska on February 5 with its largest conference-game victory margin (79–50) under John Beilein and its largest conference-game victory margin since {{defeating}} Indiana 112–64 on February 22, 1998. On February 8 the Wolverines played poorly against (#17, #13) Iowa, losing 85–67 and surrendering the most points in a non-overtime game since December 12, 2007 (against Oakland). It was the team's biggest point deficit since its loss to Wisconsin by 18 on February 6, 2010. Michigan then defeated the (#22, 20) Ohio State Buckeyes at Value City Arena, the first Michigan victory at Ohio State since the 2002–03 team defeated the Buckeyes on January 15, 2003, and ending a nine-game losing streak at Ohio State. It was the first road sweep of Michigan State, Ohio State and Wisconsin since 1992–93. On February 16 Michigan lost to (#21, 21) Wisconsin. The Wolverines set a season low on February 23 with three turnovers and no turnover points against (#13, 14) Michigan State, rebounding from an early 22–11 deficit to win 79–70. Stauskas led the way with 25 points on 9-for-13 shooting, with 21 {{in the second half}} (including 10 which brought the score from a 48–43 deficit to a 53–51 lead). He had five assists, three rebounds and no fouls, and was Big Ten Player of the Week for the third time on February 24. It was the first time Michigan defeated the same ranked opponent twice in a season since the 2000–01 team defeated the 2000–01 Iowa Hawkeyes twice. The Wolverines (19–7, 11–3 Big Ten) regained first place in the Big Ten race, ahead of Michigan State (22–6, 11–4), gaining control of its destiny <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> title with four games remaining against teams in {{the bottom half of the}} standings averaging five conference wins. On February 26, Michigan defeated Purdue 77–76 with a buzzer beater by Robinson (against his father's alma mater) in overtime. Michigan trailed by 19 (27–8) in the first half and 13 (37–24) at halftime. The 19-point deficit was the largest overcome by the Wolverines that season, raising their overtime record to 13–3 under Beilein (including eight of their last nine and three straight). It was the team's first buzzer beater since DeShawn Sims' on November 29, 2008 against Savannah State.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Spanish playmaker Victor Vázquez in midfield at the {{beginning}} of the 2017 season saw less responsibility placed on Giovinco and captain Michael Bradley to create Toronto's goalscoring opportunities, and this in turn freed up the Italian, enabling him to focus more on his attacking game. Coach Greg Vanney also switched tactics from a 4–4–2 diamond to a 3–5–2 formation, benefiting Giovinco's and Altidore's attacking partnership by allowing them to play closer together, and with Vázquez supporting them as the team's main creator, the attacking duo began to demonstrate a deeper understanding and an increased awareness of each other's movements, which improved their link-up play, and saw an increase in Altidore's goalscoring output throughout the season. Giovinco scored his first goal of the season in a 2–2 home draw to expansion team Atlanta United, on 8 April 2017. On 27 June, Giovinco scored both goals in a 2–1 home win over Montreal in the 2017 Canadian Championship final second leg — edging Montreal 3–2 on aggregate; he also won the George Gross Memorial Trophy for the most valuable player of the tournament. On 30 July, Giovinco scored two goals and set up another in a 4–0 home win over New York City FC; his second goal of the match, which came from a free kick, was his 50th MLS goal, and his record-breaking 10th MLS goal from a free kick. While Giovinco was ruled out on injury, Toronto FC won the Supporters' Shield for most points in the league that season, following a 4–2 home win over New York Red Bulls on 30 September. In Toronto FC's last match of the regular season on 22 October, Giovinco scored from a free kick on his 100th appearance for the club in a 2–2 away draw to Atlanta; in doing so, Toronto FC broke the MLS regular season point record of 68 points, set by LA Galaxy in 1998, by one point. The goal was also Giovinco's sixth free kick goal of the season, which set the record for most free kicks scored in an MLS regular-season. On 30 October, in the first leg of the Eastern Conference Semi-finals in the 2017 MLS Cup Playoffs, Giovinco scored the match-winning goal from a free kick in a 2–1 away win over New York Red Bulls. Giovinco was subsequently included among the finalists for the 2017 MLS MVP award, after being omitted from the list of finalists for the award the previous season. On 5 November, in the second leg of the Eastern Conference Semi-finals, Giovinco received a booking for dissent in the 80th minute, causing his suspension <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> Finals as he also received a yellow in the first leg; Toronto lost the match 1–0 at home, but still advanced to the next round on away goals.|$|E
