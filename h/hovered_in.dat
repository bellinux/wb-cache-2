5|$|Ahead of the preseason, then interim-head coach Ben Olsen assumed head {{coaching}} duties, under {{a three-year contract}} for an undisclosed price. Olsen became the first head coach in franchise history to both play for and coach the squad. Upon retiring as a player on 24 November 2009 Olsen became an assistant coach under head coach Curt Onalfo. On 7 August 2010 Olsen was named interim head coach after Onalfo was fired. Olsen finished the 2010 season with a 3–8–1 record. Several major offseason acquisitions were made, in both the offense and defense. Notable signings included Charlie Davies on loan, Perry Kitchen, Dax McCarty and Josh Wolff. In the summer, a major trade was made when United traded McCarty to their Atlantic Cup rivals, New York Red Bulls, for Dwayne De Rosario. During the MLS regular season, United regularly <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of the}} league's overall table, frequently swapping positions barely in or outside of a berth in the MLS Cup Playoffs. Ultimately, their playoff run ended in the 33rd week of the campaign, culminating a six-match winless streak, that included five consecutive losses.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, Hughes {{introduced}} the slightly larger three-seat Model 269B which it marketed as the Hughes 300. That same year, the Hughes 269 set an endurance record of 101 hours. To set the record, two pilots took turns piloting the aircraft and <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> ground-effect for fueling. To ensure no cheating, eggs {{were attached to}} the bottom of the skid gear to register any record-ending landing.|$|E
25|$|The Chiefs {{hosted the}} 5–8 Chargers on December 14, hoping {{to end their}} slim playoff chances. Temperatures which <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> the low 60s when early-arriving fans first showed up plunged into the 20s {{by the end of}} the game. The Chiefs {{dominated}} the game early, leading 14–3 at halftime. Chiefs quarterback Tyler Thigpen threw for one touchdown and ran for another for the Chiefs and was 19-for-28 for 171yards.|$|E
25|$|Three {{red lights}} <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> a {{triangular}} formation were seen by several witnesses in Tinley Park and Oak Park on August 21, 2004, {{two months later}} on October 31, 2004, again on October 1, 2005 and once again on October 31, 2006. The lights were captured on video by some witnesses. According to some ufologists, the video {{evidence suggests that the}} lights kept the geometrical shape and moved as if they were attached to each other through a dark object. The incident was examinated in a Dateline NBC episode on May 18, 2008 and in the episode Invasion Illinois of the television serie UFO Hunters premiered on The History Channel on October 29, 2008.|$|E

25|$|At 18:00 two RAAF UH-1B Iroquois piloted by Flight Lieutenants Cliff Dohle and Frank Riley arrived over D Company's {{location}} {{with the}} ammunition resupply, and guided by red smoke thrown by the infantry, they <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> the heavy rain {{just above the}} rubber trees near a small clearing. Because {{they were to be}} dropped from some height, the wooden outer crates—which were still banded with metal straps—were wrapped in blankets for the wounded. Aboard the helicopters the 6 RAR Regimental Sergeant Major, Warrant Officer Class One George Chinn, and the officer commanding Administration Company, Major Owen O'Brien, pushed the crates out to the soldiers waiting below, many of whom were now very low on ammunition. The boxes landed in the centre of the position and the RAAF pilots were later praised for their skill and daring. Riley was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, while Dohle was mentioned in despatches (MiD). Yet, without tools to cut the straps, the infantry had to smash the crates open using machetes or the butts of their rifles to get to the inner metal boxes. Under heavy fire Warrant Officer Class Two Jack Kirby, the Company Sergeant Major, and Sergeant Neill Rankin, the 12 Platoon sergeant, began to distribute the ammunition. However, while the machine-gun rounds were pre-loaded in belts, the rifle rounds were still in bandoliers, complicating Kirby's job and forcing the soldiers to reload their own magazines as they struggled to keep the ammunition clean in the mud and rain. The resupply retrieved the situation for D Company. Prior to its arrival they had been down to their last 100 rounds, but with it complete the Australians resumed firing, forcing the Viet Cong back for a third time.|$|E
500|$|Polls {{conducted}} in 2006 showed {{an average of}} 37percent approval ratings for Bush, the lowest for any second-term president at that point of his term since Harry S. Truman in March 1951 (when Truman's approval rating was 28percent), which contributed to what Bush called the [...] "thumping" [...] of the Republican Party in the 2006 mid-term elections. Throughout most of 2007, Bush's approval rating <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> the mid-thirties; the average for his entire second term was 37percent, according to Gallup.|$|E
500|$|On July 31 at AT Park, in a 3-1 {{win over}} the Washington Nationals, Cain won his one-hundredth career game by tossing five no-hit innings on ninety-three pitches, making him the sixth pitcher in the San Francisco Era and the twenty-third pitcher in Giants {{franchise}} history to win at least one hundred games. Cain is the second Giant on the [...] season to earn his one-hundredth career victory after teammate Johnny Cueto won his on April 26. For the second straight season, Cain's ERA <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> the high 5, finishing with a 5.64 ERA while starting 17 games for the Giants.

500|$|By {{the time}} Diefenbaker called an {{election}} for June 18, 1962, {{the party had}} been damaged by loss of support in Quebec and in urban areas as voters grew disillusioned with Diefenbaker and the Tories. The PC campaign was hurt when the Bank of Canada was forced to devalue the Canadian dollar to US cents; it had previously <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> the range from 95cents to par with the United States dollar. Privately printed satirical [...] "Diefenbucks" [...] swept the country. On election day, the Progressive Conservatives lost 92 seats, but were still able to form a minority government.

2500|$|That evening, Bennigsen {{set up his}} {{headquarters}} at Heilingenthal with {{the bulk of his}} army nearby. Gorchakov took position at Guttstadt, while L'Estocq and Kamensky <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity of Mehlsack. According to historian Francis Loraine Petre, the Russian [...] "offensive had expended its force and come to a standstill". Napoleon immediately began assembling his forces for a counteroffensive. Bennigsen ordered his army to retreat on the evening of 7 June. The Russian commander repulsed Napoleon at the Battle of Heilsberg on 10 June. But at Friedland the French emperor won the decisive battle of the war on 14 June 1807, which led to the Peace of Tilsit.|$|E

2500|$|The Toda {{people are}} a small {{pastoral}} tribal community {{who live on the}} isolated Nilgiri plateau in hill country of Southern India. Before the 18th century and British colonisation, the Toda coexisted locally with other ethnic communities, including the Kota, Badaga and Kuruba, in a loose caste-like society, in which the Toda were the top ranking. During the 20th century, the Toda population has <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> the range 700 to 900. Although an insignificant fraction of the large population of India, since the early 19th century the Toda have attracted [...] "a most disproportionate amount of attention because of their ethnological aberrancy" [...] and [...] "their unlikeness to their neighbours in appearance, manners, and customs." [...] The study of their culture by anthropologists and linguists proved significant in developing the fields of social anthropology and ethnomusicology.|$|E
2500|$|Significant {{rainfall}} {{was recorded}} along the Palm Beach County coast between November 21 and November 26 during this event, with local amounts {{of up to}} [...] measured at West Palm Beach, Florida. [...] Surface temperatures <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> the middle 50s°F, or around 13°C, within the main region of impact. However, wind and high seas were the storm's main impact due to the strong pressure gradient between the cyclone's center and a 1040hPa surface high over the Ohio Valley. Winds as high as [...] with swells of up to [...] were reported by ships in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Along the Atlantic coast, winds reached [...] at Vero Beach, [...] at Melbourne, [...] at Titusville, and [...] at Cocoa Beach.

2500|$|In 1978, Gilliam {{published}} Animations of Mortality, an illustrated, tongue-in-cheek, semi-autobiographical how-to {{guide to}} his animation techniques {{and the visual}} language in them. Roughly 15 years later, between {{the release of the}} CD-ROM game Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time in 1994, which used many of Gilliam's animation templates, and the making of Gilliam's film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), Gilliam was in negotiations with Enteractive, a software company, to tentatively release in the autumn of 1996 a CD-ROM under the same title as his 1978 book, containing all of his thousands of 1970s animation templates as license-free clip arts for people to create their own flash animations, but the project <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> limbo for years, probably because Enteractive was about to downsize greatly in mid-1996 and changed its focus from CD-ROM multimedia presentations to internet business solutions and web hosting in 1997 (in the introduction to their 2004 book Terry Gilliam: Interviews, David Sterrit and Lucille Rhodes claimed that the internet had overwhelmed the [...] "computer-communications market" [...] and gave this as the reason that the Animations of Mortality CD-ROM never materialised). Around the time of Gilliam's film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009), the project had changed into the idea of releasing his 1970s animation templates as a license-free download of Adobe After Effects or similar files.|$|E

2500|$|At 11:30p.m. on April 5, 1934, before {{reaching}} Penang, Sato was found missing by his compatriot Jiro Yamagishi. The {{last time he}} was seen was at 8:30p.m. when he had dinner in his cabin. [...] He left two suicide notes, one to his Japanese tennis teammates expressing doubts that {{he would be able to}} help the team in the upcoming contest. He begged them to forgive him and do their best to prevail in the match. He promised he would be with his colleagues in spirit. [...] The other note was addressed to the ship's captain, apologizing for the inconveniences that his actions might cause. A search for him continued for seven more hours and the vessel <b>hovered</b> <b>in</b> the strait. Wireless messages were sent to nearby ships. Later further evidence was found which confirmed the suicide theory. Two iron davit-winding handles and a training skip-rope were missing, which Sato probably used to tie weights on himself to make sure he would drown. After discovery of the new evidence, the ship sent out a radio message stating that [...] "Japan's finest tennis player and national hero was believed to have committed suicide by throwing himself overboard". On April 6, a prayer was ministered by his friends who assembled on the deck of the ship. An altar was built on board with photographs and racquets of Sato around it. [...] Also a traditional Japanese [...] "cake offering" [...] ceremony was held. [...] It was speculated that the pressure on him came from the growing prestige of the Japanese Empire and from the Japanese Lawn Tennis Association who refused to allow the exhausted Sato to have a break from tennis and skip the 1934 season. He became depressed and concerned about his abilities.|$|E
