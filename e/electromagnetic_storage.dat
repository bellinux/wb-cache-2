5000|$|According to Woodward, a {{transient}} mass fluctuation arises in an object when it absorbs [...] "internal" [...] energy {{as it is}} accelerated. Several devices could be built to store internal energy during accelerations. A measurable effect needs to be driven at a high frequency, so macroscopic mechanical systems are out of question since {{the rate at which}} their internal energy could be modified is too limited. The only systems that could run at a high frequency are <b>electromagnetic</b> energy <b>storage</b> devices. For fast transient effects, batteries are ruled out. A magnetic energy storage device like an inductor using a high-permeability core material to transfer the magnetic energy could be especially built. But capacitors are preferable to inductors because compact devices storing energy at a very high energy density without electrical breakdown are readily available. Shielding electrical interferences are easier than shielding magnetic ones. Ferroelectric materials {{can be used to make}} high-frequency electro-mechanical actuators, and they are themselves capacitors so they can be used for both energy storage and acceleration. Finally, capacitors are cheap and available in various configurations. So Mach effect experiments have always relied on capacitors so far.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{particles}} {{have attracted}} increasing attention in fields ranging from separation processes to <b>electromagnetic</b> information <b>storage</b> an medical application. Various approaches for their synthesis {{have been developed}} and studied to satisfy the criteria of production. Improvement and optimization of size, stability, and functionality is of vital importance in biological applications. The main aspect of project, initially, was to study the application of aqueous functionalized magnetic nanoparticles coupled with high gradient magnetic separation technique {{for the removal of}} trace residue of organic contaminants from drinking water. However, the importance of synthesizing stable ferrofluid for this purpose became clear later and took precedence over the initial objective. Different approaches were adopted, such as the incorporation of poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate, ethylenediamine, and chitosan, to enhance the stability of magnetic particles. However, these surface modifications had unfavorable effect on the stability of initial particles. In accord with the initial objective of the project, the possibility of utilization of β-cyclodextrin, as organic pollutant entrapment agent, was investigated in preliminary studies conducted on its interaction with a model compound, procaine hydrochloride. The outcomes of these experiments suggest its potential as a biocompatible removal agent for the elimination of organic pollutant in drinking water system, or other applications that require selective separation of organic compounds...|$|R
40|$|The {{family of}} 2 D {{transition}} metal carbides, carbonitrides and nitrides (collectively {{referred to as}} MXenes) has expanded rapidly since the discovery of Ti 3 C 2 in 2011. The materials reported so far always have surface terminations, such as hydroxyl, oxygen or fluorine, which impart hydrophilicity to their surfaces. About 20 different MXenes have been synthesized, and the structures and properties of dozens more have been theoretically predicted. The availability of solid solutions, the control of surface terminations and a recent discovery of multi-transition-metal layered MXenes offer the potential for synthesis of many new structures. The versatile chemistry of MXenes allows the tuning of properties for applications including energy <b>storage,</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> interference shielding, reinforcement for composites, water purification, gas- and biosensors, lubrication, and photo-, electro- and chemical catalysis. Attractive electronic, optical, plasmonic and thermoelectric properties have also been shown. In this Review, we present the synthesis, structure and properties of MXenes, {{as well as their}} energy storage and related applications, and an outlook for future research...|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional (2 D) {{transition}} metal carbides, carbonitrides and nitrides (MXenes) {{were discovered in}} 2011. Since the original discovery, more than 20 different compositions have been synthesized by the selective etching of MAX phase and other precursors and many more theoretically predicted. They {{offer a variety of}} different properties, making the family promising candidates {{in a wide range of}} applications, such as energy <b>storage,</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> interference shielding, water purification, electrocatalysis and medicine. These solution-processable materials have the potential to be highly scalable, deposited by spin, spray or dip coating, painted or printed, or fabricated in a variety of ways. Due to this promise, the amount of research on MXenes has been increasing, and methods of synthesis and processing are expanding quickly. The fast evolution of the material can also be noticed in the wide range of synthesis and processing protocols that determine the yield of delamination, as well as the quality of the 2 D flakes produced. Here we describe the experimental methods and best practices we use to synthesize the most studied MXene, titanium carbide (Ti 3 C 2 Tx), using different etchants and delamination methods. We also explain effects of synthesis parameters on the size and quality of Ti 3 C 2 Tx and suggest the optimal processes for the desired application...|$|R
40|$|New {{experiment}} studying radioactive ion before K-capture weak decay provides {{new method}} for investigating creation of coherent final state producing ν oscillations. Single radioactive ion passes through known <b>electromagnetic</b> interactions in <b>storage</b> ring before decaying by first order weak interaction conserving momentum described by Fermi’s golden rule. Initial state must contain coherent linear combinations of two states with same momentum difference producing final state oscillations. Following passage of ion through storage ring provides information about ν masses and mixing without detecting ν. Observing every weak decay avoids suppression in conventional oscillation experiments by low ν absorption cross sections. Normally unobservable long wave lengths made observable by long distance circulation around storage ring. No oscillations {{can be observed}} in “missing mass ” experiment where both energy and momentum are conserved. Energy-time uncertainty allows decay into same final state of two initial state components with same momentum difference and slightly different energies. Relative phase of these two components changes with time and can produce oscillations between Dicke superradiant and subradiant states. Analysis of oscillations in simple model with no fudge factors gives value for the squared neutrino mass difference in the same ball park as the KAMLAND value. Treatment consistent with quantum mechanics and causality...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} orientation of beef ribs in an <b>electromagnetic</b> field and <b>storage</b> time on the prediction of rib composition, 64 ribs (IMPS 103) were scanned (2. 5 MHz) in three different orientations: posterior end first (POS), dorsal end first (DOR), and fat side first, blade end down (BLD). Scans were obtained after 1 and 5 d of storage. Scan peak, rib weight, 3 / 4 fat depth, length, and temperature were used to predict percentage and weight of dissectable and fat-free lean. The mean peak for the BLD scans was four to six {{times higher than the}} POS or DOR scans. Ribs scanned in the BLD orientation on d 5 had the highest coefficient of determination (CD; 94. 0) and the lowest residual standard deviation (RSD;. 22 kg) for prediction of lean weight. The POS and DOR scans were similar at d 5 (CD = 91. 4 and 90. 3, respectively) with RSD of. 30 and. 31 kg, respectively. Prediction of lean percentage resulted in lower CD than predicting lean weight. For percentage of lean, BLD scans at d 5 once again resulted in the best CD (8 1. 6) and lowest RSD (1. 5 %). Prediction of percentage lean using POS or DOR orientation resulted in CD of 71. 2 and 67. 1 and RSD of 2. 0 and 2. 1 %, respectively. The CD were similar for POS and DOR scans at d 1 and d 5. Predicting fat-free lean weight resulted in equal or lower CD than dissected lean and higher CD for lean percentage. It seems that orientation during scanning, when consistent, is not a major concern. As the time between scanning and dissection increases, dehydration weight loss may need to be measured...|$|R
