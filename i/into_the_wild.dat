5|$|As {{the number}} of condors grew, {{attention}} {{began to focus on}} releasing some back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild.</b> In 1988, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> in California. Only females were released, to eliminate the possibility of accidentally introducing a South American species into the United States. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America. California condors were released in 1991 and 1992 in California, and again in 1996 in Arizona near the Grand Canyon. Though the birth rate remains low in the wild, their numbers are increasing steadily through regular releases of captive-reared adolescents.|$|E

5|$|Various {{conservation}} {{techniques are}} employed {{to prevent these}} extinctions, including laws and regulations to control hunting pressure, the establishment of protected areas to prevent further habitat loss, the establishment of captive populations for reintroduction back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> (ex situ conservation), and the translocation of individuals to suitable habitats to create additional populations.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} vector control, {{a number of}} novel methods {{have been used to}} reduce {{mosquito}} numbers with some success including the placement of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) or copepods in standing water to eat the mosquito larvae.

50|$|He {{accompanied}} the Oxford University Expedition to Spitsbergen in 1921 and took many photographs there, but {{the birds of}} the Scottish mountains and glens were always his real passion.

5|$|An {{early success}} {{story in the}} 1950s was the saving of the nene (or Hawaiian goose) from extinction. Birds {{were brought to the}} site and {{breeding}} at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene's natural habitat was not protected from the predators that had been introduced to the islands by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.|$|E
5|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{is another}} method of stabilizing the bog turtles' numbers. The technique involves mating bog turtles indoors in controlled environments, where nutrition and mates are provided. Fred Wustholz and Richard J. Holub {{were the first}} to do this independently, during the 1960s and 1970s. They were interested in educating others about the bog turtle and in increasing its population, and over several years they released many healthy bog turtles <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild.</b> Various organizations, such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, have been permitted to breed bog turtles in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Captive lemur {{populations are}} {{maintained}} locally {{and outside of}} Madagascar in many zoos, although the diversity of species is limited. Sikafas, for instance, do not survive well in captivity, so few facilities have them. The largest captive lemur population {{can be found at}} the Duke Lemur Center (DLC), whose mission includes non-invasive research, conservation (e.g. captive breeding), and public education. Another large lemur colony the Myakka City Lemur Reserve run by the Lemur Conservation Foundation (LCF), which also hosts lemur research. In Madagascar, Lemurs' Park is a free-range, private facility southwest of Antananarivo that exhibits lemurs for the public while also rehabilitating captive-born lemurs for reintroduction <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild.</b>|$|E
