Lu Bu then defeats the Coalition at Hu Lao Gate, but they are not done for yet. Also, he finds that Dong Zhuo is truly a monster, and starts a revolt in Wan Castle and cuts him <b>down.</b> <b>Now</b> in charge of Dong Zhuo's army, he defeats Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Sun Jian in several campaigns, and takes over the land.|$|E
5|$|After the missed field goal, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on offense {{at its own}} 27-yard line. Running back Kenny Lewis, Jr., {{replacing}} the suspended Branden Ore, ran for a first down, and Tyrod Taylor connected on an 11-yard pass to Eddie Royal for another first <b>down.</b> <b>Now</b> inside Kansas territory, Taylor attempted another pass. Kansas All-American cornerback Aqib Talib jumped between Taylor's throw and the receiver, intercepting the ball. Talib returned the interception 60yards to the end zone for a Kansas touchdown—the first points of the game. An extra point kick by Scott Webb made the score 70 Kansas with 5:15 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Seminoles' second {{possession}} {{of the second half}} began with more success than their first possession. State gained a first down on two running plays, then Rix completed a 14-yard pass for another first <b>down.</b> <b>Now</b> at their 36-yard line, the Seminoles advanced the ball for short ground gains on the next two plays, then Rix completed a 30-yard pass to Bell. Following the pass and first down, the Seminoles were at the Tech 34-yard line. Two short gains and an incomplete pass failed to gain another first down, so State head coach Bobby Bowden ordered kicker Beitia into the game to attempt a 47-yard field goal. The kick attempt was successful, and Beitia gave Florida State a 1310 lead with 1:42 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Vick {{passed for}} six yards, then ran {{an option for}} 12yards and a first <b>down.</b> <b>Now</b> on State's side of the field, however, the Tech offense was unable to gain another first down and punted back to Florida State, which {{returned}} the kick to its 21-yard line. State was stopped short on consecutive plays, committed a five-yard false start penalty, then was stopped for no gain on third down. After going three and out, State punted back to the Hokies, who returned {{the ball to the}} Seminoles' 41-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Vick completed a 26-yard pass to the Tech fullback, Hawkins. After three rushes failed to pick up the first down at the Florida State five-yard line, Tech coach Frank Beamer sent in Graham to kick a 23-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and with 7:54 remaining in the quarter, Tech cut Florida State's lead to 2817.|$|E
5|$|With 9:28 {{remaining}} in the quarter, Nebraska's second possession of the game mirrored its first. The Cornhuskers picked up a first down on a Scott Frost throw, but were unable to gain another after being stopped for a loss on one play and had to punt. Following the kick, Virginia Tech took over at its 28-yard line. The Hokies performed better than their first possession, picking up a quick first down on two rushes by Oxendine. Druckenmiller then completed a first-down throw that pushed the Hokies into Nebraska territory for a second time. Druckenmiller rushed for eight yards on the next play, then ran an option with Oxendine that saw the players combine for 20 yards and a first <b>down.</b> <b>Now</b> at the Nebraska 20-yard line, Oxendine ran for a yard, pushing the Hokies into the red zone. On the first play inside the Nebraska red zone, Druckenmiller completed a 19-yard pass to Marcus Parker for a Virginia Tech touchdown—the game's first points. Virginia Tech placekicker Shayne Graham kicked the extra point, and Virginia Tech took a 70 lead with 3:14 {{remaining in}} the first quarter. The drive covered 72 yards and had taken eight plays and 4:06 of game time.|$|E

25|$|The Royalists quickly {{realised}} {{that this}} presented {{them with a}} great opportunity to capture important Parliamentarian-held towns in the south-west of England. Only two days after the battle, Prince Rupert marched from Oxford, the Royalists' wartime capital, with a large army. He also sent orders to the Royalist western army which had been victorious at Roundway <b>Down,</b> <b>now</b> under the command of his younger brother Prince Maurice, to march against Bristol from the south while he himself advanced on the city from the north.|$|E
25|$|With {{the capture}} of Fort Morgan, the {{campaign}} for the lower Mobile Bay was complete. Canby and Farragut had already decided before the first landings on Dauphin Island that the army could not provide enough men to attack Mobile itself; furthermore, the Dog River Bar that had impeded bringing Tennessee <b>down</b> <b>now</b> prevented Farragut's fleet from going up. Mobile did come under combined army-navy attack, but only in March and April 1865, after Farragut {{had been replaced by}} Rear Adm. Henry K. Thatcher. The city finally fell in {{the last days of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|Florida State {{continued}} to hold their touchdown lead through the third quarter when the Crimson Tide scored their first points on a 44-yard Berrey field goal. With just 1:27 left in the game, Seminoles head coach Darrell Mudra elected to take an intentional safety instead of attempting a punt out of the endzone. He made this decision as Alabama had been close {{on a couple of}} previous attempts to block punts during the game, and did not want a block to occur in the endzone. <b>Down</b> <b>now</b> 7–5, the Crimson Tide drove into field goal territory and Berrey hit the game winner from 36-yards out with only 0:33 left in the game. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Florida State to 2–0–1.|$|E

25|$|Start {{with one}} setting exactly {{opposite}} to the other. All the pairs of particles {{give the same}} outcome (each pair is either both spin up or both spin <b>down).</b> <b>Now</b> shift Alice's setting by one degree relative to Bob's. They are now one degree off being exactly opposite to one another. A {{small fraction of the}} pairs, say f, now give different outcomes. If instead we had left Alice's setting unchanged but shifted Bob's by one degree (in the opposite direction), then again a fraction f of the pairs of particles turns out to give different outcomes. Finally consider what happens when both shifts are implemented at the same time: the two settings are now exactly two degrees away from being opposite to one another. By the mismatch argument, the chance of a mismatch at two degrees can't be more than twice the chance of a mismatch at one degree: it cannot be more than 2f.|$|E

At first she excuses herself by saying she needs a strong male who can perform a solo. As a result, Puck sings [...] "Sweet Caroline" [...] as his first solo for the glee club, dedicating it to Rachel and sealing the relationship. The two ultimately break up as a result of Rachel's feelings for Finn and Puck's feelings for Quinn.|$|E

500|$|Blues {{historian}} Samuel Charters {{sees the}} song as having elements of protest and social commentary. [...] The second verse includes [...] "the sun goin' <b>down</b> <b>now</b> boy, dark gon' catch me here", {{a reference to}} the [...] "sundown laws" [...] or curfew during racial segregation in the United States. [...] Signs in the rural South advised [...] "Nigger, don't let the sun set on you here". [...] Johnson may be expressing a real fear of trumped up vagrancy charges or even lynchings that still took place. [...] Others suggest that the song is about a deeper and more personal loneliness. [...] Writers Barry Lee Pearson and Bill McCulloch argue that the fifth verse in the single version captures the essence of the song: [...] "left alone, abandoned, or mistreated, he stands at the crossroad, looking this way or that for his woman".|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Katherine and Jill were {{believed}} to be mother and daughter after Katherine's friend, Charlotte Ramsey, provided factual proof. Of the storyline, Walton stated: [...] "She's [...] going down a bad road. In looking back over the past 16 years, she's gone down a lot of bad roads, for a lot of different reasons. She'll survive this one and, hopefully, maybe this time she'll learn something from it." [...] She also described Jill as being in a [...] "soul-searching period" [...] during the storyline, saying: [...] "Now she's numbing herself with the alcohol because all those feelings of love are coming up for her mother, and she doesn't {{know how to deal with}} them." [...] Walton said she felt Jill had been [...] "shaken to the very foundation" [...] upon the revelation that Katherine is her mother, stating: [...] "A big part of who she has been all these years has to do with her anger towards Katherine. She always shoved any feeling of love <b>down.</b> <b>Now,</b> she's questioning everything about herself. That's why she is in such pain and why she is drinking. That hate thing is baseless now." [...] While admitting to having been surprised with the maternity revelation, Walton thought it was [...] "fabulous and rich, and it's opened up a whole new facet to the story". However, in 2009, the characters' history was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell; Charlotte had made up this information for revenge against Katherine, and they were not mother and daughter.|$|E
