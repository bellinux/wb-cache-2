[...] However, in practice Congress does not have the ability to defund DACA since the program is almost entirely funded by its own application fees rather than congressional appropriations.|$|E

5000|$|Kashmir is {{believed}} to be the seat of Shaivism, Himalayas and Mount Kailash as [...] "The massed laughter of Shiva." [...] It was from here that the sweet nectar of Shiva devotion spread in India and around the globe, by the spiritual works of saints like Adi Shankaracharya. Soundarya Lahari was composed by Adi Shankara atop the Gopadari Hill, after accepting the fact that the union of Shiva and Shakti, as in Shaktism, transpired into the Shakti-Shri Chakra, the symbol of Devi (Goddess), as Sri Yantra, as mentioned in 'Shankara Digvijay' - Life history of Shankaracharya, and only when Shiva is united with Shakti <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> power to create.|$|E
5000|$|Bigger Thomas: The {{protagonist of}} the novel, Bigger commits two ghastly crimes and {{is put on}} trial for his life. He is {{convicted and sentenced to}} the {{electric}} chair. His acts give the novel action but the real plot involves Bigger's reactions to his environment and his crime. Through it all, Bigger struggles to discuss his feelings, but he can neither find the words to fully express himself nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> time to say them. However, as they have been related through the narration, Bigger—typical of the [...] "outsider" [...] archetype—has finally discovered the only important and real thing: his life. Though too late, his realization that he is alive—and able to choose to befriend Mr. Max—creates some hope that men like him might be reached earlier.|$|E
50|$|After {{sixteen years}} of service he became assistant-resident of Blora (1890), and then swapped this {{district}} for the districts Berbek (1892), Toeban (1897) and Toeloeng Agoeng (1899). Mainly in the districts Blora and Toeban <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to show {{himself to be a}} good policeman. More than 28 years passed after his entrance into office before Boissevain got appointed resident of Madioen.

But Paula had her rights, and <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to go, after what had happened, unless ... unless she went with him? To go now was to kiss and ride away. Surely, since the world of sex decreed that often the same men should love the one woman, and therefore that perfidy should immediately enter into such a triangle--surely, it was the lesser evil to be perfidious to the man than to the woman.|$|R

5000|$|Morwood's {{work does}} {{not compete with}} Collard's: {{not only does he}} refer to recent studies which have made {{discussion}} about the play still richer over the last thirty years, but, more importantly, he has neither the same aim, nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same audience in mind. His book is a lot more accessible, and less technical, but also less comprehensive in its approach[...] [...] [...] The many qualities of this volume will enable numerous readers to enjoy the discovery of this magnificent play which, as James Morwood reminds us, has too long been considered as a minor work by Euripides, a play of political propaganda. Each part of the book, the Introduction, Translation and Commentary, aims to facilitate reading and stimulate interest, without drowning the reader in technical details concerning Euripides' language or the editing of his work.|$|E
5000|$|Grove {{was noted}} for {{making sure that}} {{important}} details were never missed, {{with one of his}} favorite sayings being, [...] "The devil is in the details." [...] Intel Vice President Dennis Carter states that [...] "Andy is very disciplined, precise, and detail oriented ... But at the same time, he has an element of intuition and creativity that is fundamental to Intel's innovation." [...] According to Industry Week magazine, Grove feared that the [...] "brilliance that sparked the creation of Intel" [...] during its early years, [...] "might come to nothing if somebody didn't pay attention to details." [...] Carter recalls that Grove would even correct his spelling errors: When he came to this country from Hungary in 1956, he didn't speak English. Yet I learned spelling from him. Not only <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> instincts of a teacher, but he also {{has a great deal of}} patience.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the post}} fight interviews, Marriaga praised Lomachenko, [...] "He {{dominated}} the fight. I connected with some good punches, but I couldn't get the result I was looking for. I {{wanted to continue}} the fight, but my corner stopped the fight. He basically overwhelmed me with pressure." [...] Bob Arum also showed his admiration of Lomachenko, comparing him to former heavyweight world champion and legend Muhammad Ali, who had 27 of his professional fight promoted by Arum. He said [...] "I never saw anything like this. He's unbelievable. Not only <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> knowledge, he has the skill set that I've never seen before. Fast, reflexes, everything and he really entertains. Who else did that? Muhammad Ali." [...] The fight averaged 728,000 viewers on ESPN. The move from HBO to ESPN was done to expose Lomachenko and gain more viewership, but was down by 104,000 compared to Lomachenko's last fight against Sosa on HBO. Viewership was adversely affected by a channel switch when the broadcast began and the time at which their main event started.|$|E
25|$|In {{the light}} of these potent signs of a great disturbance, the Criminal Investigation Department sent a memo to the Colonial Secretary {{suggesting}} moving Maria back to York Hill to avoid further inciting Muslim anger. The Secretary did not agree on grounds that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> received no such representations from Muslim leaders, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> authority to remove Maria without further court orders– weak excuses since Maria could be relocated with her mother's consent. Nonetheless, it cannot be said definitively that moving Maria out of the convent at such a late stage could <b>have</b> averted <b>the</b> riots.|$|R
50|$|No modern scholar, perhaps, has so nearly {{approached}} the linguistic omniscience of Mezzofanti; but, like Mezzofanti, Dr Malan {{was more of}} a linguist than a critic. He made himself conspicuous by the vehemence of his opposition to Westcott and Hort's text of the New Testament, and to the transliteration of Oriental languages, on neither of which points <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> general support of scholars. His extensive and valuable library, some special collections excepted, was presented by him in his lifetime to the Indian Institute at Oxford. He died at Bournemouth. His life has been written by his son.|$|R
