Arthur Conan Doyle's estate had some involvement in sorting out legal issues, although the stories are {{in the public domain}} in the United States.

When a child at boarding school, Ritchie and other pupils listened to the Holmes stories through dormitory loudspeakers. [...] "Holmes used to talk me to sleep every night when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> years old," [...] he said. Therefore, his image of Holmes differed from the films.

Ridgecrest {{is a small town}} in the California desert, {{composed}} mainly of what Hoppus later described as [...] "geniuses, scientists, physicists and then just complete strung-out meth-heads". Hoppus' Finnish paternal great-grandparents, Aaron and Lempi Orrenmaa, emigrated to the U.S. from Laihia. His father, like many in Ridgecrest, worked for the U.S. Department of Defense, designing missiles and bombs for the town's Navy testing center. Hoppus describes himself as [...] "pretty mellow" [...] until his parents divorced when he was eight, which had a [...] "drastic, unsettling effect" [...] on him. [...] "When my parents argued, it was always behind closed doors. I remember sitting outside my parents' room when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> years old, hearing the dulled voice of anger behind the door. It upset me a lot." [...] Following these events, he spent two years shuffling between his parents' homes with sister Anne, until he and his father moved to nearby Monterey. His father was often away earning a postgraduate degree in college. He later would describe his childhood as lonely, remarking, [...] " [...] was living by myself in the fifth grade." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) {{has been}} {{suspected}} of trafficking underage women across state lines, {{as well as}} across the US–Canada and US–Mexico borders, {{for the purpose of}} sometimes involuntary plural marriage and sexual abuse. The FLDS is suspected by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of having trafficked more than 30 under-age girls from Canada to the United States between the late 1990s and 2006 to be entered into polygamous marriages. RCMP spokesman Dan Moskaluk said of the FLDS's activities: [...] "In essence, it's human trafficking in connection with illicit sexual activity." [...] According to the Vancouver Sun, it's unclear whether or not Canada's anti-human trafficking statute can be effectively applied against the FLDS's pre-2005 activities, because the statute {{may not be able to}} be applied retroactively. An earlier three-year-long investigation by local authorities in British Columbia into allegations of sexual abuse, human trafficking, and forced marriages by the FLDS resulted in no charges, but did result in legislative change. Former FLDS members have also alleged that children belonging to the sect were forced to perform sexual acts as children upon older men while being unable to leave. This has been described by numerous former members as sexual slavery, and was reported as such by the Sydney Morning Herald, One former resident of Yearning for Zion, Kathleen Mackert, stated: [...] "I was required to perform oral sex on my father when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seven,</b> and it escalated from there." ...|$|E
