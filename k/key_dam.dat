40|$|Background: Although {{human and}} {{equipment}} resources, proper training, and the verification of endotracheal intubation are vital elements of difficult airway management (DAM), their availability in Japanese emergency departments (EDs) {{has not been}} determined. How ED type and patient volume affect DAM preparation is also unclear. We conducted the present survey to address this knowledge gaps. Methods: This nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted from April to September 2016. All EDs received a mailed questionnaire regarding their DAM resources, airway training methods, and capnometry use for tube placement. Outcome measures were the availability of: (1) 24 -h in-house back-up; (2) <b>key</b> <b>DAM</b> resources, including a supraglottic airway device (SGA), a dedicated DAM cart, surgical airway devices, and neuromuscular blocking agents; (3) anesthesiology rotation {{as part of an}} airway training program; and (4) the routine use of capnometry to verify tube placement. EDs were classified as academic, tertiary, high-volume (upper quartile of annual ambulance visits), and urban. Results: Of the 530 EDs, 324 (61. 1 %) returned completed questionnaires. The availability of in-house back-up coverage, surgical airway devices, and neuromuscular blocking agents was 69. 4, 95. 7, and 68. 5 %, respectively. SGAs and dedicated DAM carts were present in 51. 5 and 49. 7 % of the EDs. The rates of routine capnometry use (47. 8 %) and the availability of an anesthesiology rotation (38. 6 %) were low. The availability of 24 -h back-up coverage was significantly higher in academic EDs and tertiary EDs in both the crude and adjusted analysis. Similarly, neuromuscular blocking agents {{were more likely to be}} present in academic EDs, high-volume EDs, and tertiary EDs; and the rate of routine use of capnometry was significantly higher in tertiary EDs in both the crude and adjusted analysis. Conclusions: In Japanese EDs, the rates of both the availability of SGAs and DAM carts and the use of routine capnometry to confirm tube placement were approximately 50 %. These data demonstrate the lack of standard operating procedures for rescue ventilation and post-intubation care.

40|$|Abstract In any dam siting {{study in}} arid regions, {{rainfall}} records, runoff measurements and their greatest magnitudes are very important. Unfortunately, {{the data are}} scarce and, therefore, empirical approaches and charts obtained from similar regions {{in other parts of}} the world are necessary for complete applications. The lack of observed data presents the major problem tor runoff modelling in arid regions. These regions have characteristically high rainfall intensity and consequent flash floods with large amounts of sediments. Occurrence of rainfall is sporadic, both temporally and spatially, which makes the interpretation of the rainfall-runoff relationship quite difficult. Flood estimations play a significant role in dam siting from the point of view of water availability. This paper presents the basic calculations of floods and sediment amounts that are necessary in dam siting and construction in an arid area by considering the southwestern part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. <b>Key</b> words <b>dam</b> siting; flood estimation; hydrological observations; data scarcity; arid regions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Studies on spatial {{diversity}} in species composition, dominance patterns and abundance of malacocenoses in the Zegrzyñski Reservoir {{were carried out}} in the late 1990 s, and changes since the 80 s were assessed. The malacocenoses of the reservoir in the 90 s were characterized by a considerable structural diver-sity and varied abundance. The species diversity was higher in the littoral while the abundance was generally higher in habitats located farther from the shore. After a period of rapid development of the 80 s, in the 90 s the malacofauna stabilised at a lower level of abundance and species richness, while the dominance patterns became more pronounced. The phenomenon could be related to progressive eutrophication as well as ageing of the reservoir. Compared to other dam reservoirs the mollusc fauna of the Zegrzyñski Reservoir is still quite rich in terms of both abundance and number of species. <b>KEY</b> WORDS: <b>dam</b> reservoir, malacocenoses, long-term changes, spatial diversit...|$|R

The two embankment dams are 66, 56 meters high and 960, 1008 meters long respectively. One of the dams suffered from severe landslide because of the 1976 Tangshan Earthquake, the design PGA of this site is set to 0. 25 g. Because of the complexity, it is quite difficult to predict the dam earthquake response by numerical simulation, thus the recorded motion data will be very useful for the dam dynamic design and seismic safety assessment. In order to monitor the earthquake response of the two dams, two unique sets of new type earthquake monitoring system are developed and installed in February 2003. Each of the system consists of a Data Logger (16 bit resolution, synchronous 18 channels) and 16 Force Balanced Accelerometers (0 - 50 Hz, 120 dB). Accelerometers are installed at the bottom, middle {{as well as the}} top of the dams. Two gears of sensitivity are set for the accelerometers; one is for strong motion recording and the other for microtremor measurement.

That is, the floods resulted by dams break have caused the most hazardous disasters in last two centuries. During a dam break, financial loss is inevitable; however, the death tolls depend on drowned area, population of downstream and the available alarm time. The analysis of dam break is a 2 -step process. In the first step, they analyze the real break. Then, specific models will rout the outflow caused by the break and estimate it in populated areas. If the population exposed to danger, exactly resides downstream a dam, the details of dam break will not affect the results much; however, the flood duration and other key parameters will be significant. An equation with the least uncertainty and error average provides the break parameters i. e. peak flow, failure time and break width of Bidekan earth dam in western Iran.

Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet.

By substantially changing natural flow patterns and blocking movements of fish and other animals, large dams can severely disrupt natural riverine production systems – especially fisheries, flood-recession agriculture and dry-season grazing. We offer here the first global estimate of the number of river-dependent people potentially affected by dam-induced changes in river flows and other ecosystem conditions.
