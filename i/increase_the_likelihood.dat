5|$|DNA damage, due to {{environmental}} factors and normal metabolic processes inside the cell, occurs {{at a rate}} of 10,000 to 1,000,000 molecular lesions per cell per day. While this constitutes only 0.000165% of the human genome's approximately 6 billion bases (3 billion base pairs), unrepaired lesions in critical genes (such as tumor suppressor genes) can impede a cell's ability to carry out its function and appreciably <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> of tumor formation and contribute to tumour heterogeneity.|$|E
5|$|Many {{academics}} {{have discussed}} {{use of the}} Magic Wand to treat chronic anorgasmiaa type of sexual dysfunction {{in which a person}} cannot achieve orgasmand other sexual problems including female sexual arousal disorder. A study published in 1979 in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology analyzed the training of women in self-masturbation techniques in a sample of individuals who previously had difficulty experiencing orgasm. The researchers gave women the Magic Wand to help excite the clitoris and <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> they would experience an orgasm. They found self-administered treatment using the Magic Wand to be the most efficient option to address prior problems achieving orgasm.|$|E

5|$|Other {{possibilities}} exist, as well. For example, immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody {{to one or}} more proteins {{of interest}} that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood,</b> and is more amenable to large-scale studies.|$|E
5|$|Frog {{mutations}} {{and genetic}} defects have increased since the 1990s. These often include missing legs or extra legs. Various causes {{have been identified}} or hypothesized, including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn {{on the surface of}} ponds, chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, and parasites such as the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae. Probably all these are involved in a complex way as stressors, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. An {{increase in the number of}} frogs eaten by birds may actually <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> of parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode's complex lifecycle includes the ramshorn snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} success of implants is determined, in part, {{by the forces}} they have to support. As implants have no periodontal ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of implants must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support. Concentrated forces can result in fracture of the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant. The ultimate location of implants is based on both biologic (bone type, vital structures, health) and mechanical factors. Implants placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part of the bottom jaw have lower failure rates than implants placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the upper jaw. People who grind their teeth also increase the force on implants and <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> of failures.|$|E

5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with dantrolene or diazepam; diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. Outcomes are often difficult to predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.|$|E

40|$|The Texas Statewide Youth Leadership Forum (TXYLF) {{provides}} self-advocacy {{training to}} high school youths with disabilities. TXYLF is an enhanced version of the Youth Leadership Forum (YLF) that is comprised of an initial five day training, a nine month support phase, regional YLFs, and the opportunity for participants {{to return to the}} five day training to serve as a mentor to their peers. This study?s purpose was to examine the TXYLF participants? post-training outcomes and the relationships among advocacy involvement and adult outcomes. To achieve this purpose, former TXYLF participants were surveyed between one and six years after their participation in TXYLF. The correlational study analyzed descriptively the participants? outcomes and inferentially, through logistic regression, the relationships among participants? adult outcomes, self-advocacy involvement, and the various TXYLF participation components. The results demonstrated that TXYLF participants? post-training postsecondary education attendance was higher than the national average for adults with disabilities. Participants with low incidence disabilities were involved in inclusive employment more often than the national average. A minority status <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> of involvement in secondary education advocacy, having a high incident disability <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> of post-training employment, and being under 21 years old <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> of living independently post-training, involvement in postsecondary education advocacy, and involvement in employment advocacy. Involvement in TXYLF for one full year, including involvement as a mentor, <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> of post-training employment; involvement in TXYLF?s nine month support phase and involvement as a mentor <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> of post-training postsecondary education attendance, postsecondary education advocacy, and employment advocacy. Attending a regional YLF further <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> of postsecondary education and postsecondary education advocacy. Furthermore, involvement in TXYLF as a mentor <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> of post-training employment, postsecondary education, and independent living. No significant relationships were observed for self-advocacy and adult-outcomes.

40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{knowledge}} about effects of behaviors during online sexual solicitations. Our aims were to explore the prevalence of identity deception and wanting to keep the interaction a secret, and how these behaviors relate to the outcome of sexual interactions online. The participants were adults who self-reported online sexual interactions with a stranger during the last year. We separated them into groups based on the age of their contact: (1) those that interacted sexually with adults (n = 640) and (2) those that interacted sexually with a child or adolescent (n = 136). Neither the prevalence of identity deception, suggesting secrecy, nor the outcomes of the interactions differed between the two groups. Suggesting secrecy <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> of receiving a sexual picture with an adult contact, whereas using any identity deception <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> with a child or adolescent. Several deceptions as well as suggesting secrecy <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> of cybersex within both groups, while using identity deceptions mostly decreased <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> of meeting <b>the</b> contact offline in both groups.
