5|$|The South Tower has one freight {{and three}} {{passenger}} elevators. The elevators are the second fastest {{in the city}} of San Francisco, second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. The elevators of the South Tower can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. The elevators have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. The bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{completion}} of an overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard, Seahorse put to sea on 9 March 1945 for her seventh war patrol. Following patrol in the Tsushima Strait, she sank a small junk with gunfire on 8 April. On 18 April, {{an attack by}} two patrol boats left the submarine's interior a shambles of broken glass, smashed instruments, and spilled <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil.</b> Seahorse made hasty repairs and headed for Apra Harbor, Guam, and then to Pearl Harbor for overhaul.|$|E
25|$|Cutting fluids degrade {{over time}} due to {{contaminants}} entering the lubrication system. A {{common type of}} degradation is the formation of tramp oil, also known as sump oil, which is unwanted oil that has mixed with cutting fluid. It originates as lubrication oil that seeps out from the slideways and washes into the coolant mixture, as the protective film with which a steel supplier coats bar stock to prevent rusting, or as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> leaks. In extreme cases {{it can be seen}} as a film or skin on the surface of the coolant or as floating drops of oil.|$|E
25|$|The salvage {{operation}} {{was awarded to}} the Dutch salvage company Smit International. A team of five salvage experts boarded Kulluk on 2 January 2013 to assess the structural integrity of the grounded drilling barge. On 3 January, {{it was reported that}} Kulluk had suffered damage since the grounding but its structural integrity had not been compromised and there have been no leaks from the rig's fuel tanks. At the time of the grounding, Kulluk was carrying 139,000 gallons of diesel fuel and 12,000 gallons of lubricating and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil.</b> By 4 January, 14 vessels had been mobilized for the recovery operation and the United States Department of Defense provided two Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters to transport heavy salvage gear to the site.|$|E

30|$|Both {{windmill}} and <b>hydraulic</b> pressed <b>oils</b> {{have been}} used in the 19 th century. However, we preferred to use the water-washed windmill pressed <b>oil</b> above the <b>hydraulic</b> pressed <b>oil</b> for several reasons. Firstly, by using the windmill extraction method relative large amounts of linseed oil could be pressed at once; if we had used the hydraulic press at our disposal instead, the process would have been far more time consuming. Furthermore, the water-washed windmill oil has a somewhat lower quality—a higher acid value and a more yellow colour—than the <b>hydraulic</b> pressed <b>oil,</b> which is possibly what one might expect for a linseed oil produced in the 19 th century.|$|R

Industrially important impacts are on the maintenance of mariculture, membrane systems (e.g., membrane bioreactors and reverse osmosis spiral wound membranes) and cooling water cycles of large industrial equipment and power stations.

40|$|Agricultural and {{transport}} equipment is {{ideally suited to}} use <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oils.</b> After engine <b>oils,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fluids are {{the second most important}} group of lubricants. More than 85 % of these materials are currently mineral oil-based. In view of their high ecotoxicity and low biodegradability, mineral oil-based lubricants constitute a considerable threat to the environment. In contrast, most hydraulic fluids based on plant oils have a low environmental impact and are completely biodegradable. Moreover, lubricants based on plant oils display excellent tribological properties and generally have very high viscosity indices and flash points. For this reason, therefore, particularly soybean, sunflower and rapeseed seem to possess the relevant properties as a potential hydraulic fluid. There are several tribotechnical methods how to assess the current technical state of used lubricants (viscosity, water content, flash point, acidity). One of the modern methods how to detect wear particles is LaserNet Fines, which is a suitable technique for machine condition monitoring. The ageing of test oils is analysed by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR); for determining anti-wear properties of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oils,</b> the standard STN EN ISO 20623 : 2004 indicates 1 hour under an applied load of 150 N. The objective of the paper is to show the description and examples of modern tribotechnical methods used for determination of the technical state of used biolubricants utilized in agriculture {{and transport}} machinery...|$|R

It was later reported that according to DEC data which dates back to 1978, the substation involved had spilled 179 times previously, more than any other Con Ed facility.

2500|$|Final {{treatment}} {{of iron and}} steel products before onward sale into manufacturing includes pickling in strong mineral acid to remove rust and prepare the surface for tin or chromium plating or for other surface treatments such as galvanisation or painting. [...] The two acids commonly used are hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. Wastewaters include acidic rinse waters together with waste acid. Although many plants operate acid recovery plants (particularly those using hydrochloric acid), where the mineral acid is boiled away from the iron salts, there remains a large volume of highly acid ferrous sulfate or ferrous chloride to be disposed of. Many steel industry wastewaters are contaminated by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil,</b> also known as soluble oil.|$|E

Since {{the pressure in}} both expressing methods was the same, {{it seems likely that}} the colour difference is caused by the crushing of the seeds. P.F.

Therefore, we decided to scrutinize the seeds themselves.|$|R
