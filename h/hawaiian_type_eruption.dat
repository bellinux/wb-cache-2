5000|$|Also {{unlike other}} eruptive <b>types,</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>eruptions</b> often occur at {{decentralized}} fissure vents, beginning with large [...] "curtains of fire" [...] that quickly die down and concentrate at specific locations on the volcano's rift zones. Central-vent eruptions, meanwhile, often {{take the form}} of large lava fountains (both continuous and sporadic), which can reach heights of hundreds of meters or more. The particles from lava fountains usually cool in the air before hitting the ground, resulting in the accumulation of cindery scoria fragments; however, when the air is especially thick with clasts, they cannot cool off fast enough due to the surrounding heat, and hit the ground still hot, accumulating into spatter cones. If eruptive rates are high enough, they may even form splatter-fed lava flows. Hawaiian eruptions are often extremely long lived; Puʻu ʻŌʻō, a cinder cone of Kilauea, has been erupting continuously since 1983.|$|R
40|$|Cinder cones {{are common}} on Banks Peninsula and this study {{concentrates}} on eleven sites {{situated on the}} Lyttelton Volcano. The study focuses on the structure, petrology and geochemistry of cinder cones and discusses their eruptive history. Lyttelton volcanism began in the Miocene (10. 8 Ma) with early (L 1) activity centred near "Head of the Bay". Constant replenishment of the main chamber caused L 1 lavas to be dominantly basaltic with limited differentiation. The development of a large cone resulted in distension which caused the development of horizontally fed radial dikes. Initial dike activity was low and lavas were dominantly fed from the central conduit with little flank activity. As L 1 grew though, dikes became more common and so did cinder cone activity on the flanks. Cinder cones would have been fed by volatile rich magmas quickly reaching the surface via dikes and hence erupting explosively. The increase in dikes during L 1 also caused the increasing development of more evolved magmas that fed lavas. Then during a quiescent period there was large-scale collapse of the eastern flank, followed by erosion and weathering of the L 1 volcanic edifice during which activity shifted north-east to "Charteris Bay". Renewed (L 2) activity after the quiescent period gave rise to more evolved lavas due to the large increase in dike activity, caused by the large amounts of stress acting on the edifice. Hence cinder cone activity on the flanks was also very common. Cinder cone samples are dominated by phenocrysts of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, olivine and Ti-magnetite and show {{a wide range of}} mineral textures. This suggests that crystals have grown under a variety of temperatures and pressures and/or been derived from magmas of different compositions. Geochemically the cones are part of an alkaline basalt-hawaiite-mugearite- benmoreite-trachyte association. The deposits in this study are all inferred to have formed by Strombolian and <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>type</b> <b>eruptions</b> due to their small dispersal areas. These eruptions formed cinder cones whose morphology depended on numerous factors, all of which contributed to their overall development: In this study the deposits have been classified into four facies based on welding, dip direction, block and bomb size, colour and {{the presence or absence of}} some clasts. The Vent Facies consists of densely welded grey/black fused spatter and represents vent and early formed products. Vesicularity is 80 % flattened clasts with deposits inferred to be welded due to their flattened nature. Spatter flows are common in the facies due to the rapid accumulation of spatter and its flowage. The Medial Facies consist of crudely bedded bomb, block and lapilli beds. Clasts are undeformed and non-welded. The Distal Facies consist of lapilli, ash, and crystals. Rare bombs occasionally occur and the deposits are generally well sorted and bedded. Overall, throughout each of the facies, clast size and welding decreases with increasing distance from the vent area...|$|R

30|$|Strombolian eruptions are {{frequently}} {{associated with the}} release of low-viscosity magma with a composition of basalt to basaltic andesite (e.g., Houghton and Gonnermann 2008; Taddeucci et al. 2015). A burst of overpressurized gas slugs has been considered as a possible mechanism for triggering major Strombolian eruptions (e.g., Blackburn et al. 1976; Chouet et al. 2003; James et al. 2009; Parfitt 2004; Ripepe 1996; Vergniolle and Gaudemer 2015). Recently, a variety of eruption styles have been reported. For instance, at Stromboli Volcano, Italy, eruption styles are classified into three <b>types.</b> <b>Type</b> 0 <b>eruptions</b> are gas-dominated, <b>Type</b> 1 <b>eruptions</b> are dominated by coarse ballistic clasts, and <b>Type</b> 2 <b>eruptions</b> consist of an ash-rich plume (Leduc et al. 2015; Patrick et al. 2007). Some part of the ash emitted by a <b>Type</b> 2 <b>eruption</b> falls back to the vent, which covers the vent as debris. This recycling process has also been recognized through the morphological observation of ash grains (D’Oriano et al. 2014). Reheating causes groundmass crystallization, sintering/welding, and a color change (D’Oriano et al. 2013). Such debris prevents the gas and magma flows in the conduit and may contribute to the generation of a viscous plug at a shallow conduit, which in turn affects the eruption styles (Capponi et al. 2016; Gaudin et al. 2017). Although its origin is controversial, the existence of a viscous plug has been suggested by the textural, geochemical, and rheological analysis of ejected pyroclasts and bombs (e.g., Gurioli et al. 2014; Lautze and Houghton 2007; Leduc et al. 2015).|$|R
5|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} <b>types</b> of <b>eruptions.</b> The most well-observed are magmatic eruptions, which involve the decompression of gas within magma that propels it forward. Phreatomagmatic <b>eruptions</b> are another <b>type</b> of volcanic <b>eruption,</b> {{driven by the}} compression of gas within magma, the direct opposite of the process powering magmatic activity. The third eruptive type is the phreatic eruption, which {{is driven by the}} superheating of steam via contact with magma; these eruptive types often exhibit no magmatic release, instead causing the granulation of existing rock.|$|R
5|$|There are two <b>types</b> of <b>eruptions</b> {{in terms}} of activity, {{explosive}} eruptions and effusive eruptions.
