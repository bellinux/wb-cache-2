He believes in me that much. I'm really blessed ... It's the most incredible gift that Mr Gibson could have given me." [...] She acknowledged to the Herald Sun that it was helpful to have Gibson's production company assist with her music career, [...] "If you think about it, every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger, because it's pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry. So I've become very lucky, and I'm very grateful. You don't control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I'm <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> I've always been doing. It's not like I've changed my goals at all." ...|$|E
500|$|The album artwork for Irresistible {{was shot}} by Alberto Tolot in April 2001. The front sleeve cover shows Simpson, wearing heavy makeup and with blond hair, dressed in a semi-transparent shirt, raising it a bit to expose her navel. Simpson said [...] "God gave me my body, you know. I'm <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> I can {{to make it look}} good." [...] Later in an {{interview}} with the Orlando Sentinel, she said that the album art was [...] "a sign of confidence". However, the cover received negative attention from many critics, including the conservative Christian publication Plugged In, which was a strong supporter of Simpson and her virgin image, and Sweet Kisses. They stated, [...] "If anything, Irresistible copes with temptation by yielding to it which, in conjunction with Simpson's general immodesty, models a dubious sexual ethic." [...] Canadian music magazine Chart also gave a negative response, writing [...] "it takes more than wearing see-through clothes, with airbrushed, non-existent nipples, to show that you have matured." [...] A few critics criticized the art for being digitally edited, while others commented on Simpson's similarity to Spears. The Japanese version of the album has the same front sleeve artwork as that of [...] "Irresistible" [...] single.|$|E

[...] "Went to New York in 1929 from Boston all alone with very little money…this was the depression, and I soon discovered that most of these people were people out of work and <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> I was doing – sitting and figuring out what to do for food and a place to sleep." ...|$|E

Sam had {{the door to the}} control room open, and stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' We said, 'We don't know'. He said, 'Well, back up.

[...] The clip fulfilled the intention of [...] "creating a world around her," [...] desiring to have an [...] "iconic" [...] aura. Kahn exclaimed [...] "the great thing about Janet is that her videos go all out, and that's risk-taking. She's not <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> other people are doing, she's willing to go and try to create something new." [...] Jackson responded [...] "I enjoy trying different things, video wise as well as make-up and costuming, that's fun for me.

2500|$|In 1988, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were looking}} for a {{replacement}} for their drummer D.H. Peligro, who had recently been fired. Already into the process of working on their fourth studio album and hiring new guitarist, John Frusciante, the band held open auditions for a new drummer. Smith {{was one of the last}} drummers to audition for the band and the band felt that on looks alone, Smith would be the wrong fit as he looked more hair-metal than punk. Nonetheless, the band was blown away by his audition. Singer Anthony Kiedis admired Smith and found his persistence impressive. Smith joined the Chili Peppers in December 1988 and within a few months was recording his first album with the band, Mother's Milk. Smith reflected on joining the band in a 2012 interview by saying “I remember thinking, ‘Oh, cool, they have a record deal. Great! I’d love to be in a band that has a record deal. We started playing, and right away we just hit it off musically. I was like, ‘Man, this is a blast! These guys are great!’ ... We were <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> we do. We just jammed, which is what we still do today. It’s very similar.” ...|$|E

60|$|In {{spite of}} {{suffering}} because love {{was not the}} first emotion in his heart, the girl could only feel he was right not to be loving her; that she ought to be glad of what was eating up all else within him. It was ungenerous, unworthy, to want to be loved at such a moment. Yet she could not help it! This was her first experience of the eternal tug between self and the loved one pulled in the hearts of lovers. Would she ever come to feel happy when he was <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> he thought was right? And she drew a little away from him; then perceived that unwittingly she had done the right thing, for he at once tried to take her hand again. And this was her first lesson, too, in the nature of man. If she did not give her hand, he wanted it! But she was not one of those who calculate in love; so she gave him her hand at once. That went to his heart; and he put his arm round her, till he could feel the emotion under those stays that would not be drawn any closer. In this nest beneath the ash-tree they sat till they heard the organ wheeze and the furious sound of the last hymn, and saw the brisk coming-forth with its air of, 'Thank God! And now, to eat!' till at last there was no stir again about the little church--no stir at all save that of nature's ceaseless thanksgiving....|$|E
