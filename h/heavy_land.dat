Heavy soils usually have a system of permanent drains using either perforated plastic or clay pipes which discharge into a ditch. Mole ploughs are used to form small tunnels (mole drains) in the soil {{at a depth of}} up to 950mm (30in) at an angle to the pipe drains. Water from the mole drains seeps into the pipes and runs along them into a ditch.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>heavy</b> <b>land</b> {{defensive}} {{wall was}} built {{north and east}} to the city in 1800–1814 by Jazzar Pasha and his Jewish advisor, Haim Farhi. It consists of a modern counter artillery fortification which includes a thick defensive wall, a dry moat, cannon outposts and three burges (large defensive towers). Since then, no major modifications have taken place. The sea wall, which remains mostly complete, is the original wall built by Zahir that was reinforced by Jazzar Pasha. In 1910, two additional gates were set in the walls, one in the northern wall {{and one in the}} north-western corner of the city. In 1912, the Acre lighthouse was built on the south-western corner of the walls.|$|E

Loudon sailed from New York with six thousand men, and was joined at Halifax by Admiral Holborne with a fleet of eleven warships.

5000|$|This Canary Islands {{stonechat}} is {{now considered}} Endangered, as construction, mainly tourism-related, encroaches upon the best habitat (Illera et al., 2006).

In particular, <b>heavy</b> <b>land</b> clearance on the Jandía peninsula is isolating the local subpopulation and making it vulnerable to adverse effects of small population size.|$|E
