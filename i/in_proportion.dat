Briefly, the lipids with or without dapivirine were dissolved in methanol: dichloromethane 1 : 2 (v/v) at room temperature. The lipid mixtures were deposited on the side wall of a rotary glass vial by removing the solvent with nitrogen. The resulting dried lipid films were hydrated in 10 -mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4. This process led to the spontaneous formation of pegylated liposomes. The liposomes were then extruded through 0.2 or 0.1  μm Anotop 10 filters (Whatman). Excess dapivirine was removed on a Sephadex G 25 column [34].|$|R
