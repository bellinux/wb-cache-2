50|$|The <b>deepwater</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes mentella), {{also known}} as the beaked redfish, ocean perch, Atlantic redfish, Norway haddock, red perch, golden redfish, or hemdurgan, may reach a size of 55 - 70 cm, but is usually less than 45 cm. It lives in {{comparatively}} high concentrations in the North Atlantic, for example in the Irminger Sea where considerable numbers are fished. It occupies depths between 300 and 1000 m and is often pelagic, i.e. far off the bottom. The deep-sea redfish feeds on a variety of food organisms, for example small fishes. In contrast to most fishes that spawn unfertilised eggs, the <b>deepwater</b> <b>redfish</b> has internal fertilisation and spawns free-living larvae.|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} cruise {{was made}} in the Irminger Sea west and southwest of Iceland and adjacent waters on the Icelandic vessel Árni Friðriksson, from 03 Jun- 04 Jul 2003. The main purpose was to study distribution and abundance of <b>deepwater</b> <b>redfishes,</b> Sebastes mentella et sp., other pelagic fishes, zooplankton, phytoplankton and the hydrography of the area. Part of the cruise was devoted to a special study on community structure at transect over {{the northern part of the}} Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Reykjanes Ridge). In this paper, an overview is given on the composition of the pelagic fish community, both vertically and horizontally, over the northern part of the Reykjanes Ridge. In total, nine trawl hauls were made with a “GLORIA” midwater trawl outfitted with a small mesh size (9 -mm) cod-end. Three hauls were made at three different depths west of the Ridge, three above it and three East of the Ridge. A total of 230 nautical miles separated hauls taken west of the Ridge and east of it. A minimum total of 44 species were identified from 23 families. Lanternfishes (Myctophidae), pearlsides (Sternoptychidae), barracudinas (Paralepididae), dragonfishes (Stomiidae) and deep-sea smelts (Microstomatidae) dominated fish catches. Results show that the total number of fishes caught was lowest east of the Ridge, coinciding with warmer deep waters. At all positions both number of species and families increased with depth as the number of individuals decreased with depth...|$|R
40|$|In the early- 1960 s a <b>deepwater</b> form of <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes mentella Travin) {{was found}} at depths more than 500 m on the {{continental}} slopes of Labrador and North Newfoundland. This group differed from the beaked redfish commonly distributed in these areas by the biological peculiarities of non-developed reproductive organs and lack of sexual dimorphism. The results of nearly 30 -year observations showed that the form of non-maturing redfish had not changed. They were distributed along the continental slope northward of Div. 3 K and the fish size increased from north to south. The distribution of this form of redfish {{was similar to that}} of non-maturing roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris). The origin and causes which led to inhibition of gonadal development of both groups were considered to be analogous. The non-maturing group of redfish was thought to originate from partial eggs and larval drifts from the Irminger Sea to form a pseudo-population in the area studied. The need for studies of the population and its exploitation of this potentially commercially valuable group is emphasized...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Greenpeace International {{has added}} the <b>deepwater</b> <b>redfish</b> to its seafood red list.

50|$|The Acadian redfish is colored reddish-orange and {{can live}} up to 50 years or more and reach lengths up to 20 in. It is very similar in {{appearance}} to the <b>deepwater</b> <b>redfish</b> Sebastes mentella. The two species can be distinguished {{by the number of}} soft rays in the anal fin, internal examination of the gas bladder, or by genetic testing.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{majority}} of Greenland is covered by permanent glaciers, the sea is the source for most food. Seafood dishes include various fishes (often smoked), mussels, and shrimp. Ammassat or capelin, a fish in the salmon family is commonly eaten and can easily be dried. Atlantic halibut, redfish, <b>deepwater</b> <b>redfish,</b> Greenland halibut, and lumpfish are fished from the west coast, as are Greenland cod (Gadus ogac) and shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius), but these two are eaten {{only as a last}} resort. Arctic char is fished off the east coast. The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) is rarely eaten because it is poisonous but can be edible after a complicated preparation of either boiling the meat repeatedly or fermenting the meat.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the data}} from {{research}} in 1983 - 2002, {{the results from the}} study of <b>deepwater</b> <b>redfish</b> sexual maturation, of the annual cycle of gonad development, the sex ratio and reproduction of the deep-water redfish Sebastes mentella Travin 1951 occurring on the Flemish Cap Bank (Div. 3 M) are presented. It was established that males insignificantly prevailed over females in catches. The total sex ratio was close to 1. In the period of research all over the Flemish Cap Bank most of fish were immature. The greatest portion of mature redfish was registered in 1983 and amounted to 82. 0 %. The results of redfish sexual maturation rate study on Flemish Cap indicated that males with the length of 19 cm and females as long as 20 cm aged 5 were first occurring as mature individuals. Mass maturation of fish takes place under the length of 28 - 32 cm, when they are 9 - 12 years old. A complete maturation of redfish comes at age 18 and under the length of 39 cm. It is shown on the basis of analysis that the peak of larva extrusion is observed in March-April. The extrusion takes place on the Flemish Cap Bank slopes, at 300 - 750 m depths, with water temperature of 4 - 5 ºC. The mass copulation comes about in September-November, when the bulk of mature males are at maturity stages V and VI...|$|E
40|$|Data {{from the}} EU (Spain-Portugal) bottom trawl surveys in the Division 3 M of the NAFO Regulatory Area (2004 - 2013) were {{analyzed}} to examine patterns on this zone of groundfish assemblage structure and diversity {{in relation to}} depth. 1699 hauls between 129 and 1460 m in depth were carried out. We focused on the 29 most abundant species, which made up 87. 5 % of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 600 m. Three main assemblages were identified. A shallow assemblage {{was found in the}} shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 250 m and include American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Assemblage II (Intermediate) includes the strata with depths between 251 and 600 m and comprises Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulates), thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata), longfin hake (Phycis chesteri), <b>deepwater</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes mentella), spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) and Northern wolffish (Anarichas denticulatus). Three species are present in the two first assemblages: Atlantic wolffish (Anarichas lupus), golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) and spotted wolffish (Anarichas minor). Assemblage III (Deep) contains the depth strata greater than 601 m. Marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), scaly dragonfish (Stomias boa), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), sloane’s viperfish (Chaulonius sloani), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemitzii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), blue antimora (Antimora rostrata), threadfin rockling (Gaidropsarus ensis), bean’s sawtoothed eel (Serrivomer beanii), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), lanternfish (Lampanyctus sp), vahls’s eelpout (Lycodes vahlii), Arctic skate (Amblyraja hyperborea) and Demon catshark (Apristurus sp) formed Assemblage III. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the collapse. Extending depth range to 1460 m, no another boundaries were found. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacements of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. Acadian redfish and golden redfish appear to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the collapse in some species and the permanent fishing activity target to the North Shrimp (Pandalus borealis), redfish (Sebastes spp) and Greenland halibut, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|E
