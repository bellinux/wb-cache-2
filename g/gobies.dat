5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as <b>gobies</b> and wrasse, have the same colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile Caribbean reef {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger sharks {{such as the}} tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) and the bull shark (C. leucas). Few parasites are known for this species; one is a dark {{variegated}} leech often seen trailing from its first dorsal fin. Off northern Brazil, juveniles seek out cleaning stations occupied by yellownose <b>gobies</b> (Elacatinus randalli), which clean the sharks of parasites while they lie still on the bottom. Horse-eye jacks (Caranx latus) and bar jacks (Carangoides ruber) routinely school around Caribbean reef sharks.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the leopard}} shark {{consists}} of small benthic and littoral animals, most significantly crabs (Cancridae, Grapsidae, and Hippoidea), shrimp, bony fish (including anchovies, herring, topsmelt, croakers, surfperch, <b>gobies,</b> rockfish, sculpins, flatfish, and midshipmen), fish eggs, clams, and the echiurid fat innkeeper worm (Urechis caupo). This opportunistic hunter {{has also been}} known to eat ghost shrimp, polychaete worms, and the young of smoothhounds, shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), and bat rays (Myliobatis californicus). Eelgrass (Zostera) and algae may be swallowed incidentally.|$|E
50|$|Stonogobiops nematodes, the Filament-finned prawn-goby, the high-fin <b>goby,</b> the red-banded <b>goby,</b> the high-fin red-banded <b>goby,</b> {{the striped}} <b>goby,</b> the barber-pole <b>goby,</b> or the black-ray <b>Goby,</b> is {{a species of}} marine <b>goby</b> native to the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean from the Seychelles to the Philippines and Bali.|$|R
25|$|Pholidichthys leucotaenia is {{commonly}} called the engineer <b>goby</b> or convict <b>goby,</b> {{but is not}} a <b>goby.</b>|$|R
5|$|The ichthyofauna of {{the park}} is among the richest in Europe with 41 {{freshwater}} and brackish water species of fish, as well as 70 marine fish species. There are nine Ponto-Caspian and five boreal relict species. The Ponto-Caspian dates from the ancient Sarmatian Sea. The boreal dates from the epoch of Quaternary cooling. There are several species restricted to the Black Sea basin (vyrezub, mushroom <b>goby,</b> bighead <b>goby,</b> toad <b>goby,</b> tubenose <b>goby,</b> western tubenose <b>goby</b> and racer <b>goby).</b> The round <b>goby</b> and estuarine perch {{are found in the}} Caspian and Black Sea basins.|$|R
5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, <b>gobies</b> and flatfishes, the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Quite common {{within its}} small range, the {{sluggish}} and reclusive puffadder shyshark {{is often seen}} lying still on the sea floor. It is gregarious and several individuals may rest together. A generalist predator with grasping dentition, the puffadder shyshark is known to take a variety of small benthic prey: crustaceans (including crabs, shrimp, crayfish, mantis shrimp, and hermit crabs), annelid worms (including polychaetes), bony fishes (including anchovies, jack macherels, and <b>gobies),</b> cephalopods (including squid), and fish offal. Overall, the most important component of this shark's diet is crustaceans, followed by polychaetes and then fishes. Males seem to prefer polychaetes, while females prefer crustaceans. It has been observed attacking a common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) by tearing off an arm with a twisting motion.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, {{the common}} torpedo spends much time {{resting on the}} sea floor, often buried in sediment. It is an ambush {{predator}} that pounces onto prey and stuns them with electricity, the process taking {{only a fraction of}} a second. Once the prey is immobilized, it is manipulated to the mouth with motions of the disc, and swallowed whole. Adults feed almost entirely on small benthic bony fishes, including soles, herring, mullet, <b>gobies,</b> goatfishes, porgies, dragonets, and jack mackerels. Large decapod crustaceans are a minor secondary food source, while very rarely skates may be consumed. Juveniles are less exclusively piscivorous than the adults and feed on a variety of invertebrates as well. The most significant prey species differ between seasons and geographic regions. For example, in the Tyrrhenian Sea, juvenile common sole (Solea solea) are by far the most important prey item in autumn and winter, but in spring and summer they become less available and other fishes figure more prominently in the ray's diet. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Phyllobothrium lactuca, and the monogeneans Amphibdella paronaperugiae and Amphibdelloides benhassinae.|$|E
5000|$|Definitive hosts are Cobitis taenia, and gobies: toad <b>goby</b> (Mesogobius batrachocephalus), bighead <b>goby</b> (Ponticola kessleri) and monkey <b>goby</b> (Neogobius fluviatilis).|$|R
25|$|Ponticola kessleri, the bighead <b>goby</b> or Kessler's <b>goby,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>goby</b> native to Eurasia. The bighead <b>goby</b> is a Ponto-Caspian relict species. It inhabits the fresh and {{oligohaline}} waters, with mineralisation from 0-0.5‰ up to 1.5-3.0‰.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goby</b> and Moray - Two hogfish rustlers. <b>Goby</b> is beige and skinny, while Moray is {{dark brown}} and fat. Moray's {{job is to}} feed the hogfish (the hogfish hate his cooking), and <b>Goby's</b> job is to guard the hideout. Moray's shown to be smarter than <b>Goby.</b> <b>Goby</b> was voiced by David Gasman, and Moray was voiced by Christian Erickson.|$|R
25|$|Round <b>gobies</b> are small, soft-bodied fish, {{characterized}} by a distinctive black spot on the first dorsal fin. Their eyes are large and protrude slightly {{from the top of}} the head and, like most <b>gobies,</b> round <b>gobies</b> have pelvic fins that are fused to form a single disc on the belly of the fish shaped like a suction cup. Round <b>gobies</b> range in length from 4 to 10nbsp&inches (maximum of 9.7nbsp&inches (24.6nbsp&cm)), and in weight from 0.176 ounces to 2.816 ounces, increasing as they age. Male round <b>gobies</b> are larger than females. Juvenile round <b>gobies</b> (less than one year old) are grey. Upon maturation, round <b>gobies</b> become mottled with gray, black, brown, and olive green markings. Adult male round <b>gobies</b> turn inky black during the spawning season and develop swollen cheeks. Male and female round <b>gobies</b> are easily differentiated through the shape of their urogenital papilla, which is white to grey, long and pointed in males, and brown, short and blunt-tipped in females.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} <b>gobies</b> {{are kept in}} aquaria. Most captive <b>gobies</b> are marine. Perhaps the most popular is the small but {{colorful}} neon goby. Most <b>gobies</b> stay toward the lower portion of the aquarium, hiding in the rockwork, but some species (most notably the shrimp <b>gobies)</b> prefer to dig themselves little burrows. Aquarists typically {{provide them with a}} fine-grained substrate to prevent damage to their delicate undersides.|$|E
25|$|Members of the {{subfamily}} Amblyopinae are elongated mud-dwelling <b>gobies</b> {{commonly known}} as the eel <b>gobies</b> or worm <b>gobies.</b> Their two dorsal fins are connected by a membranous structure and their eyes are highly reduced. They are usually pink, red, or purple in coloration. Amblyopinae contain 12 genera and about 23 species.|$|E

This species inhabits coastal estuaries, lakes and {{freshwater}} streams. It can reach a length of 3.8 cm SL.|$|R
2500|$|The blackeye <b>goby</b> (Rhinogobiops nicholsii) is [...] {{monotypic}} in {{the genus}} Rhinogobiops. It {{is a true}} <b>goby,</b> belonging to the subfamily Gobiinae of the <b>goby</b> family Gobiidae.|$|R
40|$|Three of {{the four}} species of {{non-native}} gobiids currently reported in the Rhine basin were recently recorded in France: the Western tubenose <b>goby</b> in 2007, the bighead <b>goby</b> in 2010 and the round <b>goby</b> in 2011. The bighead <b>goby</b> and the round <b>goby</b> displayed a very high rate of range expansion, suggesting a human-assisted colonisation through inland navigation. An assessment of the invasiveness potential by the FISK (Fish Invasiveness Screening Kit) reveals a medium risk for the Western tubenose <b>goby,</b> while the bighead <b>goby</b> and the round <b>goby</b> {{are at high risk}} of becoming invasive in France. This assessment is consistent with our observations since there has been a steady increase in the range of the Western tubenose <b>goby,</b> although in low numbers, while the relative abundance of bighead <b>goby</b> and round <b>goby,</b> recently arrived in the French part of the Rhine River and Moselle River, can be high. Given their fast expansion, it can be assumed that these species will soon reach other French basins, particularly in the south (Rhône basin) and in the west (Seine basin), and the implementation of measures to limit their spread should be considered...|$|R
25|$|Sleeper <b>gobies</b> are {{a closely}} related family (Eleotridae) that lack the fused pelvic fin sucker typical of most <b>gobies,</b> but are {{otherwise}} very similar in size, shape, and ecology.|$|E
25|$|Members of Benthophilinae are {{endemic to}} the Ponto-Caspian region (including the Marmara, Black, Azov, Caspian, and Aral Seas). The {{representatives of the}} {{subfamily}} have fused pelvic fins and elongated dorsal and anal fins. They are distinguished from the closely related subfamily Gobiinae {{by the absence of}} a swimbladder in adults and location of the uppermost rays of the pectoral fins within the fin membrane. Its members include tadpole <b>gobies,</b> monkey <b>gobies,</b> and bighead <b>gobies...</b>|$|E
25|$|Round <b>gobies</b> {{actively}} feed both nocturnally and diurnally, and {{are believed}} to detect prey only while stationary. The primary diet of round <b>gobies</b> includes mollusks, crustaceans, worms, fish eggs, zebra mussels, small fish, and insect larvae.|$|E
50|$|Sufflogobius bibarbatus, the Bearded <b>Goby</b> or Pelagic <b>Goby,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>goby</b> native to the southeastern Atlantic Ocean. It is {{currently}} the only known member of its genus.|$|R
50|$|Valenciennea helsdingenii is {{a species}} of <b>goby</b> from the Indo-Pacific. It is {{commonly}} known as the twostripe <b>goby,</b> black-lined sleeper <b>goby,</b> or railway sleeper <b>goby.</b> It can grow up to a length of 25 cm and is distinguishable by two prominent orange to black lines running longitudinally through its body.|$|R
50|$|The blackeye <b>goby</b> (Rhinogobiops nicholsii) is {{the only}} species {{classified}} under the monotypic genus Rhinogobiops. It is a true <b>goby,</b> belonging to the subfamily Gobiinae of the <b>goby</b> family Gobiidae.|$|R
25|$|<b>Gobies</b> avoid predators by tucking {{themselves}} into coral crevices or partly burying themselves in sand. They continually scan for predators with eyes that swivel independently. The camouflage of the tassled scorpionfish can prevent <b>gobies</b> from seeing them until it's too late.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gobies</b> in warmer waters reach {{adulthood}} {{in a few}} months, while <b>gobies</b> in cooler environments reach adulthood in two years. The total lifespan of goby {{varies from}} one to ten years, again with the species in warmer waters generally living longer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gobies</b> {{are spread}} {{all over the world}} in {{tropical}} and temperate near shore-marine, brackish and freshwater environments. Their range extends from the Old World coral reefs to the seas of the New World, and includes the rivers and near-shore habitats of Europe and Asia. <b>Gobies</b> are generally bottom-dwellers. Although many live in borrows, a few species (in genera Caecogobius, Glossogobius and Luciogobius) are true cavefish. On coral reefs, <b>gobies</b> constitute 35% {{of the total number of}} fishes and 20% of the species diversity.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>gobies</b> {{remember}} landmarks {{that are}} within short distances, {{and use them}} to find their ways. Small frillfin <b>gobies</b> (Bathygobius soporator) live in intertidal zones. They swim through the pools during high tides and memorize how each pool connects to the others. Then, during low tides, they can exhibit accurate jumping behaviors, as they have memorized the paths. In a new environment, these <b>gobies</b> do not show jumping behaviors or jump into wrong pools. Nevertheless, after one night, they show the same accurate jumping behaviors.|$|E
