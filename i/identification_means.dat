During these tests, structural vibrations are evoked {{by a set}} of single exciters placed at suitable structural points. Multi-axis vibration facilities are recently utilized for the dynamic qualification of space structures performed for experimental dynamic load simulation. These facilities open up the possibility of performing structural dynamics <b>identification</b> by <b>means</b> of multiaxial base excitation. During the past few years, extensive research has been performed in this field at the Institute of Aeroelasticity. This report summarizes the results achieved up to now. Starting with the fundamentals, various methods of structural dynamics <b>identification</b> by <b>means</b> of multiaxial base excitation are explained including a variant of the phase resonance method, methods of phase separation in the frequency domain, as well as a method for analysis of transient vibrations in the time domain. The experimental application of these methods on a laboratory structure performed with DLR's multi-axis vibration simulator MAVIS is elucidated. The results are used to emphasize the specific features of the applied methods as well as the features of structural dynamics <b>identification</b> by <b>means</b> of multi-axial base excitation in general.

5000|$|Data {{identification}} {{is the process}} of identifying the subsets of available data to focus on for analysis. The data by itself is useless unless it's interpreted, once we start analyzing the data it begins to become useful as it conveys a message. Any data that conveys a meaningful message becomes information. On a high level, unprocessed data takes the following forms to translate into exact message: noisy data; relevant and irrelevant data, filtered data; only relevant data, information; data that conveys a vague message, knowledge; data that conveys a precise message, wisdom; data that conveys exact message and reason behind it. To derive wisdom from an unprocessed data, we need to start processing it, refine the dataset by including data that we want to focus on, and organize data to identify information.

40|$|We {{distinguish}} between identification and establishing causality. <b>Identification</b> <b>means</b> forming a unique mapping from features {{of data to}} quantities that are of interest to economists. Establishing causality is synonymous with finding sources of exogenous variation. These two issues are often confused. However, exogenous variation is only sometimes necessary and never sufficient to identify economically interesting parameters.

We illustrate these points by examining identification in two recent papers: one causal study relying on an entirely verbal model and one non-causal study relying on a formal mathematical model...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of characterizing and modeling large-scale networks using classes of range-dependent graphs which possess appropriate small-world properties. The application we have in mind is to bioinformatics, where methods of rapid protein <b>identification</b> <b>mean</b> that such proteome datasets, listing various observed protein-protein associations, will {{become more and more}} prevalent. We introduce a class of range-dependent graphs, governed by a power law relating intervertex range to edge probability, which are amenable to analysis, and for which macroscopic graph parameters are given by explicit forms. We show how these may be employed in representing a given network using a maximum likelihood approach. This in turn annotates every given edge with its range, representing the tendency for such an association to be transitive. We apply this technique to published proteome data, and demonstrate that known protein associations are thus identified. © 2002 The American Physical Society...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{identification}} arises whenever structural models are estimated. Lack of <b>identification</b> <b>means</b> that the empirical implications of some model parameters are either undetectable or {{indistinguishable from the}} implications of other parameters. Therefore, identifiability must be verified prior to estimation. This paper provides a simple method for conducting local identification analysis in linearized DSGE models, estimated in both full and limited information settings. In addition to establishing which parameters are locally identified and which are not, researchers can determine whether the identification failures are due to data limitations, such as lack of observations for some variables, or whether they are intrinsic {{to the structure of}} the model. The methodology is illustrated using a medium-scale DSGE model. DSGE models Identification...|$|E

We study an estimator which relies essentially on this model and not on the characteristics of the “irregular” variants.
