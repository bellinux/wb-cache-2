40|$|The land surface skin {{temperature}} diurnal cycle (LSTD) is {{very important}} for the understanding of surface climate and for evaluating climate models. This variable, however, cannot be obtained globally from polar-orbiting satellites because the satellites usually pass a given area twice per day and because their infrared channels cannot observe the surface when the sky is cloudy. In order to more optimally use the satellite data, this research is designed, for the first time, to solve the above two problems by advance use of remote sensing techniques and climate modeling. Specifically, this work is divided into <b>two</b> <b>parts.</b> Part one deals with obtaining the skin temperature diurnal cycle for cloud-free cases. We have developed a "cloud-free algorithm" to combine model results with satellite and surface-based observations, thus interpolating satellite twice-daily observations to the diurnal <b>cycle.</b> <b>Part</b> <b>two</b> studies the cloudy cases. The "cloudy-pixel treatment" presented here is a hybrid technique of "neighboring-pixel" and "surface air temperature" approaches. The whole algorithm has been tested against field experiments and climate model CCM 3 /BATS in global and single column mode simulations. It shows that this proposed algorithm can obtain skin temperature diurnal cycles with an accuracy of 1 - 2 K at the monthly pixel level...|$|R

It also sees a 1 mpg improvement. The Tribute Hybrid was dropped after the 2009 model year.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{attempts to}} integrate the household and children more fluidly into measures of well-being in the past. In part one, I develop a Monte Carlo simulation to test some of the assumptions of Allen’s welfare ratio methodology. These included his assumptions that family size was constant over time, {{that there were no}} female-headed households and that women and children did not participate in the labour force. After all of the adjustments, it appears that Allen’s welfare ratios underestimate the welfare ratios of a demographically representative group of families, especially if women and children’s labour force participation is included. However, the predicted distributions also highlight the struggles of agricultural labourers, who are given separate consideration. Even the average agricultural labourers’ family with women and children working would have had to rely of self- provisioning, gleaning, poor relief or the extension of the working year to make ends meet at the poorest point in their family life <b>cycle.</b> <b>Part</b> <b>two</b> adjusts Floud et al. ’s estimates of calorie availability in the English economy from 1700 to 1909 for the costs of digestion, pregnancy and lactation. Taken together, these three additional costs reduced the amount calories available by around 15 per cent in 1700 but only by 5 per cent in 1909 because of the changing composition of the English diet. Part three presents a new adaptive framework for studying changes in children’s growth patterns over time and a new methodology, longitudinal growth studies, for measuring gender disparities in health in the past. An adaptive framework for understanding growth provides a more parsimonious explanation for the vast catch-up growth achieved by slave children in the antebellum American South. The slave children were only able to achieve this catch-up growth because they were programmed for a tall height trajectory by relatively good conditions in utero. Finally, impoverished girls experienced greater catch-up growth than boys in two schools in late-nineteenth century Boston, USA and early-twentieth century London, suggesting that girls were deprived relative to boys before entering these institutions.

30|$|The {{test was}} carried out as a field study with twelve {{participants}} being passengers in an instrumented car. The test route included nine cycle crossings, that all were combined with pedestrian crossings. The participants individually pushed a noiseless button when they saw a dummy bicyclist standing still at a crossing, in part one, and when they saw a correctly marked <b>cycle</b> crossing in <b>part</b> <b>two.</b> Visibility distances to bicyclist dummies and cycle crossings were measured. Half of the participants experienced dry road surface {{and the other half}} wet road surface. An analysis of variance was conducted with a split plot design of group (wet / dry road surface) × target (bicyclist dummy / cycle crossing) × crossing (9 different cycle crossings).|$|R
30|$|After {{that and}} {{assuming}} that {{the capacity of the}} bins transported by the train is always 5 parts for all the types of parts, the demand of bins is calculated as in Table  2 b for the first 10  cycles and for the first 9 stations. For example at the first station, we need at the first <b>cycle</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts,</b> so we need a bin at this cycle. The bin must come one cycle earlier, which is cycle 0. The three remaining parts in the bin can satisfy the demand for the third cycle and also for the fifth cycle. However in the seventh cycle, we need a new bin. This way is followed for all the cycles and stations.|$|R

40|$|Purpose Currently, the {{reduction}} of weight in automotive {{is a very important}} topic in order to lower the air pollution. In this context, {{the purpose of the present}} paper was to analyze a real case study through a comparison of the environmental sustainability between a conventional steel crossbeam for light commercial vehicles and an innovative lightweight aluminum one. Methods For both scenarios, a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment methodology and a sensitivity analysis has been used through the study of the following phases: mineral extraction, component manufacturing, use on vehicle, and end of life. In particular, many primary data and a complete vehicle model simulation with three different European driving cycles have been used in order to reach the highest possible level of accuracy during the analysis. Results and discussion Regarding the manufacturing phase, the aluminum component’s production gave the highest impact because of the high energy required in the mineral reduction. Anyway, this stage of the analysis had a low effect on the entire LCA,becausethebenefitofweightreductionduringvehicleuseshowedastronglyhighercontribution. Theurbandrivingcycle had the most relevant impact, as a consequence of the frequent start and stop operations and the longest time with engine at idle speed, while the <b>extra-urban</b> <b>cycle</b> is the less demanding due to its higher average speed and no start and stop.

40|$|Developed Countries that {{signed the}} Kyoto Protocol are {{required}} to attain the established limits to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or to pay penalty for the exceeding amount. In order {{to comply with the}} Protocol, CEE strategy is based on capillary information of fuel consumption of motor vehicles, to be done by producers, coupled to economic incentives to users in order to encourage ecological choices. The need to standardize the measure of GHG emission, related to the fuel consumption of a vehicle, allowed the drawing up of a very detailed procedure that includes the choice of driving simulation on urban and <b>extra-urban</b> <b>cycles.</b> Many drivers claim that the difference between consumption of their own car and values declared by the producer is too high; tests performed by experts and published on trade journals such as Quattroruote (Italy) and Autobild (Germany), also demonstrate this datum; unfortunately nothing can be done to go against producers as such differences mainly depend on almost unrealistic car use simulations. Car producers fully respect the 98 / 69 /CE [1] while the 1999 / 94 /CE [2] is not so carefully followed. Moreover, the presented case study evidences that the board computer (BC), also currently equipping also small cars, furnishes false data aiming to convince driver of fuel consumption that is lower than the real one. Does this also happens on other cars? Is it correct that a consumer must pay an instrument to obtain misleading advertising...|$|R
