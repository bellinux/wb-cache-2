5|$|Skelton's artwork of clowns {{remained}} a hobby until 1964 {{when his wife}} Georgia convinced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> showing at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas while he was performing there. Sales of his originals were successful, and he also sold prints and lithographs of them, earning $2.5 million yearly on lithograph sales. At {{the time of his}} death, his art dealer believed that Skelton had earned more money through his paintings than from his television work.|$|E
5|$|Two new {{characters}} {{were introduced in}} this episode. The first, Nelson Muntz, remains a frequently used recurring character, while the second, Herman, has been used far less. The design of Herman, {{with the exception of}} his missing arm, was inspired by writer John Swartzwelder. His voice, as performed by Harry Shearer, was partly inspired by George H. W. Bush. The original idea for Herman was for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> differing story for the loss of his arm with every appearance.|$|E
5|$|Agents raid Modell's apartment, {{but find}} it empty. They find cans of protein drinks in the {{refrigerator}} and medicine for epilepsy. Mulder suspects that a brain tumor has given Modell his psychokinetic ability, but that using his power is physically exhausting, forcing him to constantly consume the energy drinks. Mulder believes that he is dying and wants {{to go out in}} a blaze of glory. Modell makes a taunting phone call to Agent Burst and causes <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fatal heart attack while they try to trace him. The agents track Modell down to a hospital, where he has compelled a guard to shoot an MRI technician and kill himself. Mulder ventures inside the hospital and is captured by Modell.|$|E
50|$|Halliburton {{died after}} falling ill on a holiday to Cornwall, which forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{unsuccessful}} operation at an Exeter clinic.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} scene Vale is seen hitch-hiking and {{picked up by a}} car-driver who presumes <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> long Halloween party night. The film ends while the car leaves.|$|R
50|$|While {{conceding that}} Marinol can be {{effective}} for treatment of hypertension and would allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> travel briefly without medical marijuana, it does not allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> acceptable quality of life, Kubby said.|$|R
5|$|One day, {{he returns}} to Panyeredan to visit his family with Anwar. While there, Anwar sees some night watchmen quivering in fear near a {{cemetery}}. When told that they had seen a ghost, Anwar enters the cemetery with Hasan to disprove its existence. However, Hasan thinks he sees a ghost and runs away frightened. When ridiculed for this by Anwar, Hasan's faith is broken. This leads <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> large fight with his family about their Islamic faith, which results in Hasan's family disowning him. Upon his return to Bandung, Hasan marries Kartini.|$|E
5|$|Driving on, Marion {{stops for}} {{the night at the}} Bates Motel. The proprietor, Norman Bates, invites her to a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts, but then hears an {{argument}} between Norman and his mother about bringing a woman into her house. They eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> life outside of her. Her sense of compassion and responsibility awakened by Norman's story, Marion decides to go back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, and prepares for bed. As she is showering, a shadowy figure comes in and stabs her to death with a chef's knife. Norman discovers the murder and assumes his mother is responsible. He meticulously cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions—including the embezzled money—into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.|$|E
25|$|Maududi's {{time spent}} in jail as a {{political}} prisoner led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> personal interest in individual rights, due process of law, and freedom of political expression.|$|E
50|$|Morgan was {{selected}} by the Dallas Cowboys in the tenth round (255th overall) of the 1974 NFL Draft. Known as “Strawberry” due to his red hair, his speed allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> early impact on special teams.|$|R
50|$|Baba was {{selected}} {{as part of the}} provincial 28-man Ghana World Cup Squad, but was controversially left out of the final 23-man Squad because of indiscipline, a trait that many believe caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> inconsistent Club and International career.|$|R
50|$|Anthony James Griffith (born 28 October 1986) is an English-born Montserrat {{international}} footballer {{who plays}} for Northern Premier League Division One North side Colwyn Bay. He is noted as a tough tackling defensive midfielder, though at times this <b>has</b> led <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> poor disciplinary record.|$|R
25|$|Miller {{was never}} a star pitcher, but his ability to fill in as a starter or reliever, as needed, allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> career that spanned 18years in Major League Baseball.|$|E
25|$|With {{his return}} at Flamengo after the loan period things {{improved}} and he fought himself {{back into the}} team. During that period in a Fla-Flu derby Feyenoord director Mark Wotte got interested in the player and shortly after Flamengo allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> trial in Rotterdam.|$|E
25|$|While not {{consistently}} regaining his former velocity, Kazmir's ability to better command his pitches helped <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> season that saw him come in {{third in the}} voting for the 2013 American League Comeback Player of the Year Kazmir started 29 games (his most since 2007), posted a 10–9 record (most wins since 2009), and had a career-best strikeout to walk ratio of 3.45.|$|E
50|$|On 10 March 1991, Quinn was {{observed}} by Gardaí driving erratically in the Clontarf area. At Clontarf Garda Station, Quinn provided a urine sample, which showed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> 202 mg of alcohol for 100 ml of urine. He was banned from driving {{for a year}} and fined £250.|$|R
50|$|Wedgwood was {{a friend}} of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge and {{arranged}} for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> annuity of £150 in 1798 so Coleridge could devote himself to philosophy and poetry. According to an 1803 letter, Coleridge even attempted to procure cannabis for Wedgwood to alleviate his chronic stomach aches.|$|R
50|$|He {{made about}} 40 {{gramophone}} recordings, which show <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> stylish and intelligent singer.|$|R
25|$|In late 2016, Eichenwald was {{intentionally}} sent epileptogenic GIFs over Twitter. He {{said the}} second attempt, in December, succeeded in causing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> seizure {{and that he}} would be taking a short break from Twitter while he pursued legal action against the user that sent the image. On March 17, 2017, a Maryland man was arrested in connection with the incident and charged with cyberstalking.|$|E
25|$|The plots {{occasionally}} are {{intricate and}} always farcical, involving coincidences, misunderstandings, cross-purposes and meetings both missed and accidental. The innuendo {{of the bedroom}} farce is sometimes present (often to the disgust of the socially conservative Basil) but it is his eccentricity, not his lust, that drives the plots. The events test {{to the breaking point}} what little patience Basil has, sometimes causing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> near breakdown {{by the end of the}} episode.|$|E
25|$|As the {{relocation}} progresses, three aliens — Christopher Johnson (Jason Cope), his son, {{and a friend}} — are seen scavenging pieces of alien technology, from which they distill a fluid which they collect in a small canister. During an inspection, Wikus discovers and confiscates the canister from the shack of Christopher's friend, but accidentally sprays some of the fluid onto his own face, which causes <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> momentary seizure. Christopher's friend is subsequently killed by Koobus Venter (David James), a sadistic mercenary soldier employed by MNU.|$|E
25|$|The whole do not amount, {{in point}} of evidence, to what we know {{ourselves}} of Banneker. We know he had spherical trigonometry enough to make almanacs, but not without the suspicion of aid from Ellicot, who was his neighbor and friend, and never missed an opportunity of puffing him. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> long letter from Banneker, which shows <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> mind of very common stature indeed.|$|R
50|$|He is Mayuki's father. He's {{the former}} head of the Hyuuga family before Mayuki. He's born in the Shinano family but because of his extrasensory perception, the Hyuga family adopted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> heir. After Mayuki was born, he became nothing. Because of that, he did bad things. He is jealous of Mayuki because he wanted Mayuki's power. He's Seiran and Shien's brother in reality. He's also a doll user.|$|R
5000|$|... (From {{all this}} {{it is tempting}} to imagine the {{invention}} of the bow: the Mongol warrior, having just used rosin on his equipment, idly stroked his harp or lyre with a rosin-dusted finger and produced a brief continuous sound, which caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> inspiration; whereupon he seized his bow, restrung it with horsehair, and so on. Obviously, the degree to which this fantasy is true will never be known.) ...|$|R
25|$|He wielded {{great power}} through this enterprise: in early 1992, after being shot during a pit-bull fight, doctors at Koševo {{hospital}} were hesitant {{to perform the}} necessary operation due to the great risk involved. In response, Prazina's small army besieged the hospital and forced the surgeons to attempt the job. Although a bullet remained (causing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> limp and reduced range of motion on his left hand {{for the rest of}} his life), Prazina ultimately survived and continued his activities. By the time the Yugoslav crisis was underway, Prazina had been arrested and jailed five times, and was a well-known figure in Sarajevo's underworld.|$|E
25|$|Murray The Monster- Murray {{is a human}} {{dressed as}} a monster who once had his own TV show. When Ickis, Oblina and Krumm saw him {{they thought he was}} a real monster betraying them. Tired of making them a {{laughing}} stock, Oblina caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> nightmare. She, Krumm and Ickis theatened him but he woke up. That's when they scared him for real during a stage show. Murray then retired and started working at a toy store. He also appeared on a talk show in another episode with Simon the monster hunter and two other characters and everyone laughed at him. This character was scrapped after season 1.|$|E
25|$|In {{his early}} career, Benaud was a batting all-rounder, {{marked by a}} looping backlift which made him suspect against fast bowling but allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wide attacking stroke range. At {{the start of the}} 1949–50 season, he was still in the Second XI, but when the Test players {{departed}} for a tour of South Africa soon afterwards, vacancies opened up. Benaud was recalled to the New South Wales First XI in late December for the Christmas and New Year's fixtures. With Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller and Ernie Toshack, three of Australia's leading four bowlers from the 1948 Invincibles tour of England unavailable, Benaud bowled heavily in some matches. However, he did not have much success in his five games, taking only five wickets at 54.00.|$|E
50|$|Ma Linfan, {{frustrated}} at losing to Fighting-Fish each time in fighting fish duels, decided to steal hers, but was caught red-handed and escaped. The second time, which could <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> success, {{he ended up}} with a tussle with Fighting-Fish, which had her brushing against him on the lower bodies, causing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> erection. Because of this, he believed that {{he fell in love with}} Fighting-Fish and went to great lengths to win her love.|$|R
25|$|Following his announcement, Rasmussen Reports had Barr polling at 6% {{nationwide}} against Barack Obama (42%), John McCain (38%), and Ralph Nader (4%). The study identified Barr as the Libertarian candidate, {{but most}} voters {{said they did}} not know enough about <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> opinion of <b>him</b> personally. Barr's support in the poll was a net drain on Republicans; he picked up 7% of the Republican vote, 5% of the Democratic vote, and 5% of the unaffiliated vote.|$|R
40|$|W S Prinsloo has convincingly {{proved that}} humbleness and surety is what Psalm 131 is all about. His "text-immanent" {{approach}} allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> excellent grasp of this text and all texts that he studies. Utilising a newcomer on the methodological scene, namely Robbins' socio-rhetorical analysis, {{it is remarkable}} how Prinsloo's insights into Psalm 131 {{could be used as}} basis for the "widening of interpretive horizons" on this psalm. Continued 2001 as 'Verbum et Ecclesia'[URL]...|$|R
25|$|His {{position}} in the ruling family gave him access to archival materials that were inaccessible to the public, {{and he had the}} privilege of having these items delivered from the state archives to his home where he could work on them in the comfort of his own study. He also accumulated an extensive library, both in his St Petersburg palace and in his rural estate, Borjomi, where he liked to work undisturbed. His great wealth enabled <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> number of research assistants, a luxury seldom available to most historians. His most valuable helper with his historical work was Constantine Brummer, his aide-de-camp since the earliest years of his military career who was his loyal friend until the end.|$|E
25|$|While {{on holiday}} in Burnham-on-Sea in 1937, Betty {{suffered}} an insect bite which became infected, {{and she died}} in her husband's arms from septicaemia following amputation of her leg. The loss devastated Montgomery, who was then serving as a brigadier, but he insisted on throwing himself back into his work immediately after the funeral. Montgomery's marriage had been extremely happy. Much of his correspondence with his wife was destroyed when his quarters at Portsmouth were bombed during the Second World War. After Montgomery's death, John Carver wrote {{that his mother had}} arguably done the country a favour by keeping his personal oddities – his extreme single-mindedness, and his intolerance of and suspicion of the motives of others – within reasonable bounds long enough for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance of attaining high command.|$|E
25|$|Dally {{comes to}} check on them and he reveals that the {{tensions}} between the Greasers and Socs have increased since Bob's death. Johnny decides to turn himself in and Dally agrees to take the boys back home. As they attempt to leave, they notice the church has caught fire and several children are trapped inside. The boys run inside the burning church to save them, but Ponyboy is rendered unconscious by the fumes. At the hospital he discovers that he and Dally are not badly injured, but {{a piece of the}} church roof fell on Johnny and broke his back. Sodapop and Darry come to the hospital; Darry breaks down and cries. Ponyboy then realizes that Darry cares about him, and is only hard on Ponyboy because he wants <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good future.|$|E
5|$|David, a Mecha {{that resembles}} a human child and is {{programmed}} to display love for its owners, is sent to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica {{as a replacement for}} their son Martin, who has been placed in suspended animation until he can be cured of a rare disease. Monica warms to David and activates his imprinting protocol, causing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> enduring childlike love for her. David is befriended by Teddy, a robotic teddy bear who cares for David's well-being.|$|R
2500|$|Moore {{was sacked}} from the cabinet in July 1989. Most {{commentators}} {{at the time}} considered <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> weak politician who had been promoted beyond his ability.|$|R
50|$|Shabhaye Barareh is the prequel to On Tiptoes. Shabhaye Barareh {{is set in}} Barareh and {{describes}} Farhad's family {{more than fifty years}} ago. The series also has many of the cast members from other Modiri works such as Noghtechin, and Jayezeye Bozorg. In On Tiptoes Modiri plays the role of Farhad, and Shir Farhad(Farhad's father). In Shabhaye Barareh, Modiri is playing the younger version of Shir Farhad. Shabhaye Barareh also features Toghrol, showing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> military career in his youth, hence his strict behaviour and attitude.|$|R
