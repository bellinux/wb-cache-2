He {{was initially}} hesitant to perform more surgeries, having had limited experience in ophthalmology, but began to treat more patients after {{a large number}} of blind individuals approached him for operations. Under Rambo's leadership, the hospital became well known for its work in restoring sight through the use of [...] "eye camps," [...] surgical teams from the hospital that traveled to villages and performed eye surgeries, often cataract removal surgeries. Rambo thought of the idea of an [...] "eye camp" [...] after speaking with a patient who suggested that <b>he</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the villages to perform operations, because he knew many individuals who had lost their vision and could not make the journey out to the distant mission hospital.

After consulting with Hira Lal, who suggested Rambo test the concept, he decided to go to a village about nineteen miles from Mungeli. When he arrived at the village, there were about fifty people waiting for him to begin operating.
