5|$|Before 2009, members {{received}} the same salary as members of their national parliament. However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of 8,020.53 euro each in 2014, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs {{are entitled to a}} pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to allowances for office costs and subsistence, and travelling expenses, based on actual cost. Besides their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and immunities. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and, by other state governments, the status of visiting foreign representatives. When in their own state, they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and, in other states, they have <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> detention and <b>legal</b> <b>proceedings.</b> However, immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.|$|R

500|$|King Charles II patronised Cresswell's establishments, as he {{did those}} of Madam Damaris Page; he {{declared}} Cresswell's to be [...] "a Sound organisation". She became as well known as the politicians of her time, largely shielded <b>from</b> <b>legal</b> <b>proceedings</b> by her extensive London network of clients across the court, the guilds and government. Her increasing <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> prosecution furthered her stature as a hate figure, particularly with the many thousands of London apprentices who could not afford her bawds, and bound {{by the terms of}} their contracts, were forbidden to marry. The houses of Cresswell and Page were a target for the 1668 Bawdy House Riots that swept London. Starting on Shrove Tuesday, the rioting lasted for five days, as young apprentices burnt and smashed the royally supported brothels. To some, the brothels symbolised Charles's continental style court: licentious and awash with unaffordable debauchery.

There are many differences between active measures and covert action.

Despite interagency coordination mechanisms, the United States is too pluralistic to achieve full coordination between all the overt and covert means of exercising influence abroad.

40|$|Did {{ordinary}} people in early modern England have any coherent {{sense of the}} past? Andy Wood’s pioneering new book charts how popular memory generated a kind of usable past that legitimated claims to rights, space and resources. He explores the genesis of customary law in the medieval period; the politics of popular memory; local identities and traditions; gender and custom; literacy, orality and memory; landscape, space and memory; {{and the legacy of}} this cultural world for later generations. Drawing from a wealth of sources ranging <b>from</b> <b>legal</b> <b>proceedings</b> and parochial writings to proverbs and estate papers, he shows how custom formed a body of ideas built up generation after generation from localized patterns of cooperation and conflict. This is a unique account of the intimate connection between landscape, place and identity and of how the poorer and middling sort felt about the world around them.

40|$|The MMPI- 2 is the {{psychological}} testing instrument {{most frequently used}} in forensic treatment and evaluation contexts. This practice mirrors use of its predecessor–the MMPI–in forensic settings and likely reflects the empirical derivation and rich research base of the instruments. Given its use and acceptance by psychologists, expert testimony based on the MMPI- 2 has rarely been excluded <b>from</b> <b>legal</b> <b>proceedings.</b> MMPI- 2 -based testimony has been excluded, however, when the instrument was used {{in ways that are}} not supported by the empirical literature. Thus, {{the question is not whether}} it is appropriate to use the MMPI- 2 in forensic settings, but rather, for what purposes may the MMPI- 2 be used in forensic settings?

40|$|This article {{draws on}} {{international}} evidence {{to propose a}} solution to a key problem affecting UK paediatricians and child protection. Disciplinary actions brought by the General Medical Council against doctors for their testimony in, and or reporting of, cases of suspected child abuse, have caused damaging consequences for the profession and, worse, for child protection. Because of these cases and mounting numbers of complaints, paediatricians {{are less likely to}} report suspected child abuse, and are less willing to accept leading child protection roles. This problem demands a solution. Informed by a comparative analysis, this article suggests that enacting a legislative <b>immunity</b> for paediatricians <b>from</b> <b>legal</b> and administrative <b>proceedings</b> where a report of suspected child abuse is made in good faith, is required to restore paediatricians’ willingness to report suspected child abuse and engage in child protection work...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model where groups attempt to exert {{influence}} on policies using both bribes (plata, Spanish for silver) {{and the threat}} of punishment (plomo, Spanish for lead). We then use it to make predictions about the quality of a country 2 ̆ 019 s public officials and to understand the role of institutions granting politicians with <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>legal</b> prosecution. The use of punishment lowers the returns from public office and reduces the incentives of high ability citizens to enter public life. Cheaper plomo and more resources subject to official discretion are associated with more frequent corruption and less able politicians. Moreover, the possibility of punishment changes the nature of the influence game, so that even cheaper plata can lower the ability of public officials. Protecting officials from accusations of corruption (immunity) will decrease the frequency of corruption and may increase the quality of politicians if the judiciary is weak. These predictions are the opposite to those emerging from a model where only bribes are used. 2 ̆ 013 lobbying; threats; quality of policymakers; official immunit...|$|R
