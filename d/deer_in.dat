5|$|Originally {{created for}} deer hunting, Richmond Park now has 630 red and fallow deer that roam freely within {{much of the}} park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Some deer are also killed in road accidents, through ingesting litter such as small items of plastic, or by dogs; three deer were killed by dogs in 2012. Many of the <b>deer</b> <b>in</b> Richmond Park are {{infected}} with a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi which can be transmitted to humans through a tick bite causing Lyme disease.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species have}} been reintroduced to the gorge. White-tailed deer were {{imported}} from Michigan and released throughout Pennsylvania to reestablish {{what had once been}} a thriving population. The current population of <b>deer</b> <b>in</b> Pennsylvania are descended from the original stock introduced beginning in 1906, after the lumberman had moved out of the area. The deer population has grown so much that today they exceed their carrying capacity in many areas. River otters were successfully reintroduced in 1983 and now breed in the gorge. Despite the fears of anglers, their diet is only 5percent trout.|$|E

He was the first modern Iranian monarch to visit Europe.|$|E
