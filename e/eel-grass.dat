60|$|Her final {{employment}} was {{to gather}} seaweed of various kinds, and make herself a scarf or mantle, and a head-dress, and thus assume {{the aspect of}} a little mermaid. She inherited her mother's gift for devising drapery and costume. As the last touch to her mermaid's garb, Pearl took some <b>eel-grass</b> and imitated, as best she could, on her own bosom the decoration with which she was so familiar on her mother's. A letter--the letter A--but freshly green instead of scarlet. The child bent her chin upon her breast, and contemplated this device with strange interest, even as if the one only thing for which she had been sent into the world was to make out its hidden import.|$|E
60|$|Salem, June 15, 1835.--A {{walk down}} to the Juniper. The shore of the coves strewn with bunches of sea-weed, driven in by recent winds. <b>Eel-grass,</b> rolled and bundled up, and {{entangled}} with it,--large marine vegetables, of an olive-color, with round, slender, snake-like stalks, four or five feet long, and nearly two feet broad: these are the herbage of the deep sea. Shoals of fishes, at a little distance from the shore, discernible by their fins out of water. Among the heaps of sea-weed there were sometimes small pieces of painted wood, bark, and other driftage. On the shore, with pebbles of granite, there were round or oval pieces of brick, which the waves had rolled about till they resembled a natural mineral. Huge stones tossed about, in every variety of confusion, some shagged all over with sea-weed, others only partly covered, others bare. The old ten-gun battery, at the outer angle of the Juniper, very verdant, and besprinkled with white-weed, clover, and buttercups. The juniper-trees are very aged and decayed and moss-grown. The grass about the hospital is rank, being trodden, probably, by nobody but myself. There is a representation of a vessel under sail, cut with a penknife, {{on the corner of the}} house.|$|E
60|$|Show me {{anything}} that would make an infant smile, and you shall behold a gleam of mirth over the hoary ruin of my visage. I can spend a pleasant hour in the sun watching the sports of the village children {{on the edge of}} the surf. Now they chase the retreating wave far down over the wet sand; now it steals softly up to kiss their naked feet; now it comes onward with threatening front, and roars after the laughing crew as they scamper beyond its reach. Why should not an old man be merry too, when the great sea is at play with those little children? I delight, also, to follow in the wake of a pleasure-party of young men and girls strolling along the beach after an early supper at the Point. Here, with handkerchiefs at nose, they bend over a heap of <b>eel-grass</b> entangled in which is a dead skate so oddly accoutred with two legs and a long tail that they mistake him for a drowned animal. A few steps farther the ladies scream, and the gentlemen make ready to protect them against a young shark of the dogfish kind rolling with a lifelike motion in the tide that has thrown him up. Next they are smit with wonder at the black shells of a wagon-load of live lobsters packed in rock-weed for the country-market. And when they reach the fleet of dories just hauled ashore after the day's fishing, how do I laugh in my sleeve, and sometimes roar outright, at the simplicity of these young folks and the sly humor of the fishermen! In winter, when our village is thrown into a bustle by the arrival of perhaps a score of country dealers bargaining for frozen fish to be transported hundreds of miles and eaten fresh in Vermont or Canada, I am a pleased but idle spectator in the throng. For I launch my boat no more.|$|E
6000|$|Many {{interesting}} discoveries {{may be made}} {{among these}} broken cliffs. Once, for example, I found a dead seal which a recent tempest had tossed into the nook of the rocks, where his shaggy carcase lay rolled in a heap of <b>eel-grass</b> as if the sea-monster sought to hide himself from my eye. Another time a shark seemed {{on the point of}} leaping from the surf to swallow me, nor did I wholly without dread approach near enough to ascertain that the man-eater had already met his own death from some fisherman in the bay. In the same ramble I encountered a bird--a large gray bird--but whether a loon or a wild goose or the identical albatross of the Ancient Mariner was beyond my ornithology to decide. It reposed so naturally on a bed of dry seaweed, with its head beside its wing, that I almost fancied it alive, and trod softly lest it should suddenly spread its wings skyward. But the sea-bird would soar among the clouds no more, nor ride upon its native waves; so I drew near and pulled out one of its mottled tail-feathers for a remembrance. Another day I discovered an immense bone wedged into a chasm of the rocks; it was at least ten feet long, curved like a scymitar, bejewelled with barnacles and small shellfish and partly covered with a growth of seaweed. Some leviathan of former ages had used this ponderous mass as a jaw-bone. Curiosities of a minuter order may be observed in a deep reservoir which is replenished with water at every tide, but becomes a lake among the crags save when the sea is at its height. At the bottom of this rocky basin grow marine plants, some of which tower high beneath the water and cast a shadow in the sunshine. Small fishes dart to and fro and hide themselves among the seaweed; there is also a solitary crab who appears to lead the life of a hermit, communing with none of the other denizens of the place, and likewise several five-fingers; for I know no other name than that which children give them. If your imagination be at all accustomed to such freaks, you may look down into the depths of this pool and fancy it the mysterious depth of ocean. But where are the hulks and scattered timbers of sunken ships? where the treasures that old Ocean hoards? where the corroded cannon? where the corpses and skeletons of seamen who went down in storm and battle? ...|$|E

50|$|It {{used to be}} a {{strictly}} coastal bird in winter, seldom leaving tidal estuaries, where it feeds on <b>eel-grass</b> (Zostera marina) and the seaweed, sea lettuce (Ulva). On the east coast of North America, the inclusion of sea lettuce is a recent change to their diet, brought about by a blight on eelgrass in 1931. This resulted in the near-extirpation of the brant. The few that survived changed their diet to include sea lettuce until the eelgrass eventually began to return. Brants have maintained this diet ever since as a survival strategy. In recent decades, it has started using agricultural land a short distance inland, feeding extensively on grass and winter-sown cereals. This may be behavior learned by following other species of geese. Food resource pressure may also be important in forcing this change, as the world population has risen over 10-fold to 400,000-500,000 by the mid-1980s, possibly reaching the carrying capacity of the estuaries. In the breeding season, it uses low-lying wet coastal tundra for both breeding and feeding. The nest is bowl-shaped, lined with grass and down, in an elevated location, often in a small pond.|$|E
40|$|At {{the time}} that this study was begun, mid-summer, 1933, an epidemic, wasting disease had almost entirely {{destroyed}} the normally dense beds of the common marine <b>eel-grass,</b> Zostera marina, along the Atlantic coasts of North America and Europe. Since the plant is a prominent member of the shallow water community, sheltering a variety of larval and small sea animals, serving substantially as food for migratory game birds, and checking erosion of the bottom, and because the leaves are used for packing, upholstering, insulating, and other commercial purposes {{for which they are}} often peculiarly de sirable, the disappearance of the <b>eel-grass</b> became a problem of prac tical concern. It was recognized, too, that the extensive and persistent wasting of Zostera might indicatephytopathological relationshipsin the sea as significant as the more evident conditions in land vegetation. A further impetus was given this investigation by the popularization of a number of physical and chemical hypotheses for the depletion, of restricted application, and usually of a prejudicial nature. In France,Holland,Denmark, and Canada investigationswere already in progress (6), (7), (11), (13), (18). The history of the disease here and abroad, the current condition of the <b>eel-grass</b> beds, and the economic and ecological implications of the wasting have been developed by a number of observers, and comprehensive summaries have been published from time to time by the U. S. Bureau of Bi...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1978 Natural {{abundance}} ¹³C/¹²C ratios {{provide a}} tracer for {{the origin of}} organic carbon in complex coastal marine food-webs and also appear to be useful for examining trophic organization and food transfer efficiencies in more strictly oceanic environments. The tracer approach proved useful for analyzing the role of <b>eel-grass</b> (Zostera marina) in the food-web of Izembek Lagoon, Alaska. Both eelgrass and phytoplankton contribute to the productivity of that community. That analysis was complicated by non-ideal tracer behavior, however. Animal ¹³C/¹²C ratios appeared to depend on biochemical composition, and {{ways to deal with}} this were investigated. Furthermore, animal metabolism tended to retain ¹³C relative to ¹²C, resulting in progressive elevation of ¹³C/¹²C ratios in higher trophic levels. By assuming a uniform relation between ¹³C enrichment and metabolic stoichiometry, it was possible to deduce animal 'trophic positions' and food transfer efficiencies from ¹³C/¹²C data taken from the Bering Se...|$|E
40|$|The species nigra was {{originally}} reported by me (BABA, 1937) {{on a single}} specimen towed in the Zostera zone in Tomioka Bay, Amakusa, with a presumption that it belonged to Alderia Allman, 1846, in the general organization (depressed body-form and radula) of the animal. At {{the same time it}} was noticed that nigra differed from modesta (Lovén, 1844), type of the genus, in a series of such characters as the formation of the rhinophores, the arrangement of the branchial papillae, and especially in the non-terminal position of the anus. The real situation of nigra in the systematics has been obliged to remain unclarified until now. Here I intend to refer to Dr. A. Inaba who kindly afforded me with chances to re-discover specimens of this rare species in fair numbers from among the bushes of Zostera {{in the vicinity of the}} Mukaishima Marine Biological Station. Immediately after the above finding the species was confirmed by me from above the leaves of this <b>eel-grass</b> in Osaka Bay. By examining the newly obtained material before me, I have been led to point out additional differences between nigra and modesta in the habitats, in the egg-masses, and in several points of the internal anatomy. Establishment of a new taxon of generic rank thus appeared to be necessary for the sake of the former species (cf. MARCUS & MARCUS, 1956, p. 16; HAND & STEINBERG, 1955, p. 26) ...|$|E
40|$|Between August 18 and September 5, 1950, Dr. C. Beets, {{geologist}} Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company, {{explored the}} aquatic fauna and flora of the Great Bitter Lake. In {{the course of}} this exploration dredge hauls were made at 47 stations, distributed all over the lake. An account of this work and a description of the stations were given by Dr. Beets in a previous volume of the present journal (1953). The Decapod Crustacea collected by Dr. Beets belong to twelve species, three of which have not been reported from the Suez Canal before. Apart from these additions to our knowledge of the fauna of the Suez Canal, the present collection is of great interest because of the extensive data provided by Dr. Beets on the ecology of the localities from which the material originates. Decapoda were collected at the following stations: Station 1. Depth 1 to 2. 7 m, bottom muddy/sandy though fairly firm, thickly covered with Halophila stipulacea (Forsk.) Aschers., also yielding some Sargassum prob. crispum (Forsk.) Ag. and Spirulina subsalsa Oerst. Fauna rich. Decapoda: Metapenaeus stebbingi, Periclimenes calmani, Diogenes pugilator, Ebalia granulata, Pilumnopeus vauquelini. Station 4. A shoal in a small embayment, 0. 2 to 0. 75 m deep, with patches of <b>eel-grass</b> and mussels, bottom consisting of somewhat muddy and sandy gravel deposits. Here and there a boulder beset with small sea anemones. Decapoda: Paguristes jousseaumei, Ebalia granulata, Pilumnopeus vauquelini. Station 5.
