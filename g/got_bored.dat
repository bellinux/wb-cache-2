[...] In his interview as part of the Chicago Architects Oral Histories Project, Nagle spoke of the work his office was doing at that time: [...] "I remember the reaction to of our projects was, Wow, these guys are changing; they're doing things that are different from what they did before; there's a new movement afoot. So we all got excited about moving on to something that was different. A lot of it really had to do with history. That's what the postmodernist movement was all about. The appreciation of history made us all much better architects. One of the things that I find from 1930s and 1940s architecture is that the people who have gone through the Beaux-Arts understand the history of architecture and for the good architects, such as Alvar Aalto and Corbusier, it probably made them better modernists because they didn’t learn through abstraction. Gropius was wrong. You should know your history and understand and be able to operate on those levels and then go on to do your own thing and presumably do something that’s original." ...|$|R
5000|$|Criticism of {{the game}} stemmed from its being easier to play and {{therefore}} less realistic than its predecessor. [...] An IGN review felt the game was {{not as good as}} the original. Some reviewers felt the steering was a little [...] "jerky," [...] and one went as far as to describe the graphical details as poor. Another issue was that the game required a fast computer at the time, to display the graphics at the highest setting. A reviewer for Computer and Video Games didn't appreciate the combination of super realist cars being driven on fantasy tracks and thought that the crashes [...] "look and feel wrong". The Official PlayStation Magazine said the game had [...] "atrocious handling" [...] and that it soon <b>got</b> <b>boring.</b>|$|R

The author notes that a theme of Morrison's youth was his appreciation of music and his pleasure of creating music influenced by gospel and love. He cites Morrison's cousin Jackie Stitt who said: [...] "He {{could have been a}} good sportsman but he had no interest in it at all.
