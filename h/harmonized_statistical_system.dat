This paper identifies EU islands and their main sustainability issues, and argues for a stronger awareness of island issues in EU policy processes. It notes in particular the current restrictive definition of islands, which excludes island states, {{and the fact that}} the issues of peripherality and insularity do not fit into any of the categories provided in the EU’s impact assessment guidelines. Moreover, since European islands are found at various administrative scales, there is a lack of <b>harmonized</b> <b>statistical</b> data on fundamental factors necessary for monitoring their sustainable development...|$|R

The partition function of the <b>statistical</b> <b>system</b> has a concise expression in terms of integrals, and has the same symmetries as the kinematical ones of the canonical tensor model. We consider the simplest non-trivial case of the <b>statistical</b> <b>system</b> corresponding to the Ising model on random networks, and find that its phase diagram agrees with what is implied by regrading the Hamiltonian vector field of the canonical tensor model with $N= 2 $ as a renormalization group flow. Along the way, we obtain an explicit exact expression of the free energy of the Ising model on random networks in the thermodynamic limit by the Laplace method.
