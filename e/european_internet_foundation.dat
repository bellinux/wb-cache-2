40|$|In this paper, the {{evolution}} of infrastructure networks is modelled as a preferential attachment process. It is assumed that geographical distance and country borders provide barriers to link formation in infrastructure networks. The model is validated against empirical data on the <b>European</b> <b>Internet</b> infrastructure network covering 209 cities. The average path length and average clustering coefficient of the observed network are successfully simulated. Furthermore, the simulated network shows a significant correlation with the observed <b>European</b> <b>Internet</b> infrastructure network. The paper ends with a discussion on the future uses of preferential attachment models {{in the light of}} the literature on world cities and global cities. ...|$|R
