40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a fuzzy based model {{reference}} adaptive controller for a waste heat recovery generation system using Power Turbine Generators (PTGs) on a shipboard grid system. The PTG system is a waste heat recovery type generation making use of exhaust gas from main shipboard diesel engines. Marine propulsion of the ship can be generated by means of main diesel engine. Onboard power management is one of the main issues in ships. For efficient management of onboard power supply PTG extract part of the exhaust gas from the main diesel engine.

The present paper substitutes isentropic expansion, throttling and constant-pressure cooling as being suitable ideal models for the actual processes. Equations are presented and sample calculations are given for the cylinder-to-cylinder part of an ideal cycle representing a four-stroke naturally aspirated engine.
