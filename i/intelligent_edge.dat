The method {{is based on}} fusing multiple edge detectors to enhance the edge detection capability and overcome each edge operator disadvantages. The fusion method is implemented via pattern recognition and machine learning techniques providing an <b>intelligent</b> <b>edge</b> detector. Two classifiers were adopted in the learning task, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Artificial Neural Network. The two classifiers were evaluated on artificial and real images. A simple class labelling system based on the output of all edge detectors is suggested to provide controllability between detection sensitivity and noise resistance.

Typical large Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) need large amounts of memory and computational power, and cannot be deployed on embedded devices efficiently. We present Two-Bit Networks (TBNs) for model compression of CNNs with edge weights constrained to (- 2, - 1, 1, 2), which can be encoded with two bits. Our approach can reduce the memory usage and improve computational efficiency significantly while achieving good performance in terms of classification accuracy, thus representing a reasonable tradeoff between model size and performance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: With {{the growing}} demand of {{bandwidth}} and the development being made in the optical components technology, the IP over DWDM using optical burst switching {{seems to be the}} best solution {{to take advantage of the}} huge capacity of the fiber and accommodate high traffic of information. In this architecture the optical network is seen as an optical cloud with <b>intelligent</b> <b>edges</b> capable to interpret the IP address and store the information in electronic domains as well as checking and correcting errors. Optical burst switching [1, 3] achieves better bandwidth exploitation because all the fiber wavelengths are shared among the bursts without resource pre-allocation and the whole wavelength capacity can be used by a burst. However with higher load, contention increases, and hence the number of dropped burst increases leading to a big lost of performance. Several methods can be used to lower the burst-dropping probability such as wavelength conversion [5] and the use of buffers [6], but these solutions are still not there due to the high cost and the immaturity of technology. In this paper we will propose another method where the burst is segmented into several parts of equal length and in case of contention only the parts at the beginning, causing the conflict, will be discarded. We will analyze and compare this method with other practical methods: delayed burst, deflection routing. The segments of burst can be used to carry different class of service since the dropping probability of each segment depends on its position in the burst. The parts at the end have the smallest probability to be dropped. We prove trough analysis and simulation that the segmented burst improves the performance and is more suitable for traffic with several class of service. Key words: optical network, Optical burst switching, contention resolution, segmented burst. 1 2 Abdelilah. Maach, Gregor v. Bochman...|$|R

40|$|World-class {{manufacturing}} paradigms {{emerge from}} {{specific types of}} manufacturing systems with which they remain associated until they are obsolete. Since its introduction the lean paradigm is almost exclusively implemented in repetitive manufacturing systems employing flow-shop layout configurations. Due to its inherent complexity and combinatorial nature, scheduling is one application domain whereby the implementation of manufacturing philosophies and best practices is particularly challenging. The study of the limited reported attempts to extend leanness into the scheduling of non-repetitive manufacturing systems with functional shop-floor configurations confirms that these works have adopted a similar approach which aims to transform the system mainly through reconfiguration {{in order to increase}} the degree of manufacturing repetitiveness and thus facilitate the adoption of leanness. This research proposes the use of leading <b>edge</b> <b>intelligent</b> agent simulation to extend the lean principles and techniques to the scheduling of non-repetitive production environments with functional layouts and no prior reconfiguration of any form.

40|$|A novel mean-median filter is {{proposed}} for the suppression of impulse noise and various artifacts from the digital images. Leading Diagonal Sorting Algorithm is used with the fixed 3 x 3 size working window to compute the median. Truncated mean is computed by defining the boundaries and truncating the pixel values in the filtering window that fall outside the defined boundary. Noise detection is carried in two steps: In the first step the ‘reference pixel ’ is tested {{for the presence of}} impulses with Min-Max detection strategy. In the second stage of detection, edge preserving unique criteria is employed to further classify the pixel under test as ‘noisy ’ or ‘edge belonged’.

In focus, quality control, on a daily basis, is just performed on selected samples which are thought to indicate the whole production trend. Therefore an automated solution should be used, which offers an inline monitoring protocol joined with more statistical measurement evaluation. Pasta {{is considered one of the}} typical food around the world, production quality of pasta have always been of concern to producers. Pasta, in order to meet the criteria and expectations of consumers, must avoid the production defects like crumbling during packaging, in-homogeneousness, unevenness in size, cracks due to extra dehydration, additionally must not be glutinous on the surface (stick together). Process analytical technology is a time saver, precise and economic solution which the industry can rely on.

40|$|Measurement of {{the extent}} of damage in a real {{structure}} is extremely important in terms of any maintenance strategy. However, this measurement often turns out to be difficult, time consuming and error – prone. The necessity of a simple, fast and relatively inexpensive damage monitoring system with reliable measurements is growing for quite sometime. The paper proposes a camera based image analysis technique to quantify and classify damage in structures at various levels of scale. The general method has been applied to corroded plate specimens in the laboratory with the aim to identify the affected areas on a steel pile due to pitting corrosion. The method depends on the contrast of the corroded region with respect to its surroundings, performs <b>intelligent</b> <b>edge</b> detection through image processing techniques and computes each affected and closed region to predict the total area of the affected part along with its spatial distribution on a two dimensional plane. Moreover the performance of the camera allows defining a detection threshold and the so-called probability of detection (PoD) and probability of false alarms (PFA). PoD are suggested as functions of the area of the pitting for the construction of Receiver-Operating-Characteristic (ROC) curves. The methodology {{can be used as a}} tool for the owners/managers of the structure for objectively quantifying and localising the extent of pitting corrosion, rather than providing information through a subjective visual assessment. Moreover, it allows introducing the probability of detection and probability of false alarms in the decision chain and in risk analysis.

40|$|The {{localisation}} and calibration {{of damage}} in a structure are often difficult, time consuming, subjective and error prone. The {{importance of a}} simple, fast and relatively inexpensive non-destructive technique (NDT) with reliable measurements is thus greatly felt. The usefulness and the efficiency of any such technique are often affected by environmental conditions. The definition of damage and the subsequent interpretation of the possible consequences due to the damage introduce subjectivity into an NDT technique and affect its performance. It is of great importance in terms of practical application {{to find out the}} efficiency of an NDT technique in a probabilistic way for various damage definitions and environmental conditions through the use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Such variations of performance of an NDT tool can be predicted through simulation processes, and the test conditions conducive to good detections can be isolated and ranked according to their relative efficiency. This paper considers a camera based image analysis technique to identify,quantify and classify damage in structures at various levels of scale. The general method has been applied to identify the affected areas on aluminium due to pitting corrosion. The method depends on the optical contrast of the corroded region with respect to its surroundings, performs <b>intelligent</b> <b>edge</b> detection through image processing techniques and computes each affected and closed region to predict the total area of the affected part, together with its spatial distribution on a two-dimensional plane. The effects of various environmental factors on the quality of such images are simulated from an original photograph. The objectivity and the amount of available information, quantification and localisation and the extent of pitting corrosion are observed, together with the various constructed ROC curves. The method provides the engineer, the owner of the structure and the end-user of the NDT technique with a tool to assess the performance of the structure in an as-built condition and decide on the appropriateness of a certain NDT, under a given environmental condition and a certain definition of damage. Moreover, it allows the findings of the NDT results to be introduced in the decision chain and risk analysis...|$|E
