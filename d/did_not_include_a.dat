By the mid-1940s, this route had shifted to roughly the present Interstate 35 alignment, serving Wichita. The only major difference from the present route was between Wichita and Emporia, where the highway ran north to Newton before turning northeast along U.S. Route 50.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Alexandre-Emile Béguyer de Chancourtois, a French geologist, {{published}} an early form of periodic table, {{which he called}} the telluric helix or screw. He {{was the first person}} to notice the periodicity of the elements. With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight, de Chancourtois showed that elements with similar properties seemed to occur at regular intervals. His chart included some ions and compounds in addition to elements. His paper also used geological rather than chemical terms and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> diagram; as a result, it received little attention until the work of Dmitri Mendeleev.|$|E

Trinsey,Jr., argued that the lack of a primary violated the Seventeenth Amendment and his right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Third Circuit rejected these arguments, ruling that the Seventeenth Amendment does not require primaries.|$|E

5|$|Baseball, {{widely known}} as America's pastime, is well {{established}} in several other countries as well. The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked {{with that of the}} sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both countries. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League. The Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, the first and still the only club from outside the United States to do so. After the 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated the Expos to Washington, D.C., where the team is now known as the Nationals.|$|E
5|$|Corzine, in {{attempting}} to pass his conceptual budget, came into conflict with fellow state Democrats in the New Jersey General Assembly, particularly over their refusal to implement his proposed increase of the state's sales tax from 6% to 7% to fill a $4.5 billion budget gap. Corzine maintained that the gap could not be filled by any other means due to the state's constitution and a ruling of New Jersey's Supreme Court. Long before the deadline date, Corzine had stated {{that he would not}} accept a budget that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> sales tax increase. Due to Corzine's insistence, the state's General Assembly, which was dominated by Democrats, refused to pass a budget before the deadline.|$|E

In {{contrast to his}} touring for The Way I See It, Saadiq <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> horn section for certain shows and played on guitar for a more rock-oriented sound. While travelling between concert dates, Saadiq and his bandmates watched music documentaries for inspiration, including a documentary on Bob Marley & The Wailers and the 1973 film Wattstax. He expanded his touring in promotion of the album into August 2011, with concerts alternating between North American headlining dates and European music festivals.|$|E
5|$|Planning for Metro {{began with}} the Mass Transportation Survey in 1955 which {{attempted}} to forecast both freeway and mass transit systems sufficient {{to meet the needs}} of 1980. In 1959, the study's final report included two rapid transit lines which anticipated subways in downtown Washington. Because the plan called for extensive freeway construction within the District of Columbia, alarmed residents lobbied for federal legislation creating a moratorium on freeway construction through July 1, 1962. The National Capital Transportation Agency's 1962 Transportation in the National Capital Region report anticipated much of the present Blue Line route in Virginia with the route following the railroad right-of-way inside Arlington and Alexandria to Springfield. It <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> route in Prince George's County. The route continued in rapid transit plans until the formation of WMATA.|$|E
5|$|Several {{theoretical}} {{objections to}} the claims of Fermi's paper were quickly raised; in particular, the exact process that took place when an atom captured a neutron was not well understood at the time. This and Fermi's accidental discovery three months later that nuclear reactions could be induced by slow neutrons cast further doubt {{in the minds of}} many scientists, notably Aristid von Grosse and Ida Noddack, that the experiment was creating element 93. While von Grosse's claim that Fermi was actually producing protactinium (element 91) was quickly tested and disproved, Noddack's proposal that the uranium had been shattered into two or more much smaller fragments was simply ignored by most because existing nuclear theory <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> way for this to be possible. Fermi and his team maintained that they were in fact synthesizing a new element, but the issue remained unresolved for several years.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Davis GAA club instituted {{judicial}} review proceedings in the High Court in May 2006. Their main argument was that {{the decision of the}} council on 13 February 2006 to revert to the original plans for the stadium, which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> senior GAA pitch, was unlawful. Their submission on the technical point was accompanied by cultural arguments that 'the youth of Tallaght will be restricted to a diet of Association football' and that a soccer-only ground would place the 'applicant at a severe disadvantage in attracting the youth of Tallaght to the club, the sport and the GAA culture. The stadium, however, with the original design, could accommodate junior GAA games as the pitch used at this level fits within the stadium's dimensions. It was only senior GAA games {{that would not have been}} facilitated.|$|E
5|$|When the {{nominations}} were announced on January 25, {{the field of}} Best Picture nominees <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> bona fide blockbuster at the U.S. box office. It {{was the first time}} since 1986 that none of the five films in that category were among the top ten releases in box office prior to {{the nominations}} announcement. Furthermore, before the ceremony, all five films sold the lowest cumulative number of tickets sold since 1984. Ray was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $73million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by The Aviator ($58.4million), Finding Neverland ($32.7million), Sideways ($32.4million), and finally Million Dollar Baby ($8.4million). The combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $205million with an average gross of $41.3million per film.|$|E
5|$|When the two {{companies}} were unable to reach a solution, Twin Books filed suit against Disney for copyright infringement. Disney argued that because Salten's original 1923 publication of the novel <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> copyright notice, by American law it was immediately considered a public domain work. It also argued that as the novel was published in 1923, Anna Wyler's 1954 renewal occurred after the deadline and was invalid. The case was reviewed by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which ruled that the novel was copyrighted upon its publication in 1923, and not a public domain work then. However, in validating 1923 as the publication date, this confirmed Disney's claim that the copyright renewal was filed too late and the novel became a public domain work in 1951.|$|E

5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> separate mechanism to lock the extended leading edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system. The NTSB {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing. In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of marking sacred areas began in Japan {{as early as}} the Yayoi period (from about 500BC to 300AD) originating from primal religious beliefs. Features in the landscape such as rocks, waterfalls, islands, and especially mountains, were places believed to be capable of attracting kami, and subsequently were worshiped as yorishiro. Originally, sacred places may have been simply marked with a surrounding fence and an entrance gate or torii. Later, temporary structures similar to present day portable shrines were constructed to welcome the gods to the sacred place, which eventually evolved into permanent buildings that were dedicated to the gods. Ancient shrines were constructed according to the style of dwellings (Izumo Taisha) or storehouses (Ise Grand Shrine). The buildings had gabled roofs, raised floors, plank walls, and were thatched with reed or covered with hinoki cypress bark. Such early shrines <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> space for worship. Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: taisha-zukuri, shinmei-zukuri and sumiyoshi-zukuri. They are exemplified by Izumo Taisha, Nishina Shinmei Shrine and Sumiyoshi Taisha, respectively, and date from before 552AD. According to the tradition of , the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals adhering to the original design. In this manner, ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day.|$|E
