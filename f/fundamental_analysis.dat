Further documents are held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives of the former Soviet Republics, now the 11 independent countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States or the three Baltic States (Baltics).|$|E

25|$|Although many {{companies}} offer courses in stock picking, and numerous experts report success through technical analysis and <b>fundamental</b> <b>analysis,</b> many economists and academics state {{that because of}} the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) it is unlikely that any amount of analysis can help an investor make any gains above the stock market itself. In the distribution of investors, many academics believe that the richest are simply outliers in such a distribution (i.e. in a game of chance, they have flipped heads twenty times in a row). When money is put into the stock market, it is done with the aim of generating a return on the capital invested. Many investors try not only to make a profitable return, but also to outperform, or beat, the market. However, market efficiency - championed in the EMH formulated by Eugene Fama in 1970, suggests that at any given time, prices fully reflect all available information on a particular stock and/or market.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} with mutual fund trading that cast market timing {{in a negative}} light occurred because the prospectuses written by the mutual fund companies strictly forbid short-term trading. Despite this prohibition, special clients were allowed to do it anyway. So, the problem was not with the trading strategy but rather with the unethical and unfair implementation of that strategy, which permitted some investors to engage in it while excluding others. All of the world's greatest investors rely, to some extent, on market timing for their success. Whether they base their buy-sell decisions on <b>fundamental</b> <b>analysis</b> of the markets, technical analysis of individual companies, personal intuition, {{or all of the}} above, the ultimate reason for their success involves making the right trades at the right time. In most cases, those decisions involve extended periods of time and are based on buy-and-hold investment strategies. Value investing is a clear example, as the strategy is based on buying stocks that trade for less than their intrinsic values and selling them when their value is recognized in the marketplace. Most value investors are known for their patience, as undervalued stocks often remain undervalued for significant periods of time.|$|E

2500|$|In semi-strong-form efficiency, it {{is implied}} that share prices adjust to {{publicly}} available new information very rapidly {{and in an}} unbiased fashion, such that no excess returns can be earned by trading on that information. Semi-strong-form efficiency implies that neither <b>fundamental</b> <b>analysis</b> nor technical analysis techniques {{will be able to}} reliably produce excess returns. To test for semi-strong-form efficiency, the adjustments to previously unknown news must be of a reasonable size and must be instantaneous. [...] To test for this, consistent upward or downward adjustments after the initial change must be looked for. [...] If there are any such adjustments it would suggest that investors had interpreted the information in a biased fashion and hence in an inefficient manner.|$|E
2500|$|In weak-form efficiency, future prices {{cannot be}} {{predicted}} by analyzing prices from the past. Excess returns cannot be earned {{in the long}} run by using investment strategies based on historical share prices or other historical data. Technical analysis techniques {{will not be able to}} consistently produce excess returns, though some forms of <b>fundamental</b> <b>analysis</b> may still provide excess returns. Share prices exhibit no serial dependencies, meaning that there are no [...] "patterns" [...] to asset prices. This implies that future price movements are determined entirely by information not contained in the price series. Hence, prices must follow a random walk. This 'soft' EMH does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants not be able to systematically profit from market 'inefficiencies'. However, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e., non-trending), many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock markets to trend over time periods of weeks or longer and that, moreover, there is a positive correlation between degree of trending and length of time period ...|$|E
2500|$|Stock speculators {{and investors}} usually need a stock broker {{such as a}} bank or a {{brokerage}} firm to access the stock market. [...] Since the advent of Internet banking, an Internet connection is commonly used to manage positions. Using the Internet, specialized software, and a personal computer, stock speculators/investors make use of technical and <b>fundamental</b> <b>analysis</b> to help them in making decisions. They may use several information resources, {{some of which are}} strictly technical. Using the pivot points calculated from a previous day's trading, they attempt to predict the buy and sell points of the current day's trading session. These points give a cue to speculators, as to where prices will head for the day, prompting each speculator where to enter his trade, and where to exit. An added tool for the stock picker is the use of [...] "stock screens". Stock screens allow the user to input specific parameters, based on technical and/or fundamental conditions, that he or she deems desirable. Primary benefit associated with stock screens is its ability to return a small group of stocks for further analysis, among tens of thousands, that fit the requirements requested. There is criticism on the validity of using these technical indicators in analysis, and many professional stock speculators do not use them. Many full-time stock speculators and stock investors, as well as most other people in finance, traditionally have a formal education and training in fields such as economics, finance, mathematics and computer science, which may be particularly relevant to this occupation – since stock trading is not an exact science, stock prices have in general a random or chaotic behaviour and there is no proven technique for trading stocks profitably, the degree of knowledge in those fields is ultimately neglectable.|$|E

Among the pioneers in this discussion was John Locke, the son of an English republican, an Oxford scholar who first directed his attention to chemistry and medicine. His treatises on government, toleration and education show a mind fully awake to the possibilities of social reconstruction. Parallel with and a little later than John Locke in England, Montesquieu (1689-1755) in France subjected social, political and religious institutions to a searching and <b>fundamental</b> <b>analysis.</b> He stripped the magical prestige from the absolutist monarchy in France.
