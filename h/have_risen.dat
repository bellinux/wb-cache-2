5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and {{start of the}} 21st century visitor numbers to the Western Front {{memorials}} <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> considerably, and Australian visitors to the memorials at Gallipoli have increased hugely in recent years; the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand opened a new memorial at the site in 2000.|$|E
5|$|It {{is still}} not certain how many people died on the inner German border or who they all were, as the GDR treated such {{information}} as a closely guarded secret. But estimates <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> steadily since unification, as evidence has been gathered from East German records. As of 2009, unofficial estimates are up to 1,100people, though officially released figures give a count from 270 up to 421 deaths.|$|E

The wage bill <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> by 30% to £481,859 and the police bill had quadrupled to £55,202 - described by Bill Bell as an 'absolutely crippling' cost. There was no bank overdraft, but debts <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> to £201,434. The club's shirt sponsors were ABC Minolta Copiers.|$|R
5|$|South Dakota's early economy {{relied heavily}} on the soil, {{minerals}} and ecology of the area, as {{nearly all of the}} earliest white settlers in the area were farmers, miners, or trappers. Although other economic sectors <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> in prominence in recent years, early dependence on the land laid the foundation for the future economic activity of the state.|$|E
5|$|Starting in April 2012, Iran's {{consumers}} {{have been hit}} {{with a wave of}} rising prices that has now touched laundry detergent and food items such as cooking oil, rice, eggs and dairy products. Since April 2012, the price of food and other consumer products <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> between 10 and 20% in some cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} boom in China and India {{has caused a}} massive increase in the demand for steel in recent years. Between 2000 and 2005, world steel demand increased by 6%. Since 2000, several Indian and Chinese steel firms <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> to prominence, such as Tata Steel (which bought Corus Group in 2007), Baosteel Group and Shagang Group. ArcelorMittal is however the world's largest steel producer.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of the Irish {{financial}} crisis, emigration from Ireland <b>has</b> <b>risen</b> significantly. Data published in June 2011 showed that Irish emigration to Britain <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> by 25 per cent to 13,920 in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|The {{events leading}} up to the 72% {{increase}} in customer's rates has been referred to by BGE executives, state commissioners, and state legislators as [...] "the perfect storm". In the years since rates were capped, fuel prices <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> dramatically. Natural gas prices <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> about 125%, regular gasoline prices <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> over 150%, and heating oil prices <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> almost 200%. Maryland region’s fuel prices are tied greatly to natural gas prices. Subsequently, when Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused major natural gas pipelines to shut down for a short period, natural gas prices skyrocketed. Therefore, when BGE went to the market to procure power, prices for power were abnormally high.|$|R
5|$|Today, {{nuclear fusion}} in the Sun's core has {{modified}} the composition by converting hydrogen into helium, so the innermost {{portion of the}} Sun is now roughly 60% helium, with the abundance of heavier elements unchanged. Because heat is transferred from the Sun's core by radiation rather than by convection (see Radiative zone below), none of the fusion products from the core <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> to the photosphere.|$|E
5|$|Claudius, {{the fourth}} Roman Emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, ruled the Roman Empire {{following}} Caligula's death in AD 41 {{until his death}} in AD 54. According to Suetonius, Claudius was extraordinarily fond of the games. He is said to <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> with the crowd after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to the fighters, and he was criticized for not leaving the arena during the executions as was the custom among the noble classes.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the mechanical ore crusher in 1804 the tasks traditionally carried out by bal maidens began to be mechanised. Despite this, the rapid growth of the mines in comparison to the slow spread of mechanisation meant the number of bal maidens appears to <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> steadily, although statistics for the number of women employed in the mines {{in the early days of}} industrialisation are incomplete and a few are contradictory.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} people killed by the ongoing eruptions <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> to 275 by 18 November. The National Disaster Management Agency {{announced}} the death toll had climbed {{after more than a}} dozen victims succumbed to their injuries, the majority of those being from severe burns. Most of the 275 people were reported as being killed by searing gas clouds and from respiratory complications, burns and other illnesses related to the eruptions. Some victims died in road and other accidents during the panicked exodus from the mountain. By 22 November, the death toll <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> to 304 and by 24 November the toll <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> to 324. Syamsul Maarif, head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) explained that the death toll <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> after a number of victims succumbed to severe burns and more bodies were found on the volcano's slopes. By 3 December the toll <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> to 353.|$|R

5|$|Gyeongju has a {{small but}} growing {{population}} of non-Koreans. In 2007, there were 4,671 foreigners living in Gyeongju. This number corresponds to 1.73% of the total population, more than double the figure from 2003. The growth was largely in immigrants from other Asian countries, many of whom are employed in the automotive parts industry. Countries of origin whose numbers <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> include the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The number of residents from Japan, the United States, and Canada fell significantly in the 2003–2007 period.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, endometrial cancers newly {{occurred}} in 320,000women and caused 76,000deaths. This {{makes it the}} third {{most common cause of}} death in cancers which only affect women, behind ovarian and cervical cancer. It is more common in the developed world and is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract in developed countries. Rates of endometrial cancer <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> in a number of countries between the 1980s and 2010. This is believed to be due to the increasing number of elderly people and increasing rates of obesity.|$|E
5|$|In other areas, Grameen has {{had very}} high payback rates—over 98 percent. However, {{according}} to the Wall Street Journal, in 2001 {{a fifth of the}} bank's loans were more than a year overdue. Grameen says {{that more than half of}} its borrowers in Bangladesh (close to 50 million) <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> out of acute poverty thanks to their loan, as measured by such standards as having all children of school age in school, all household members eating three meals a day, a sanitary toilet, a rainproof house, clean drinking water, and the ability to repay a 300 taka-a-week (around 4 USD) loan.|$|E

60|$|Through this {{delicate}} perception, {{through the}} tact {{with which it}} invariably seized it, and through the genius with which it always acted on it, the Circumlocution Office <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> to overtop all the public departments; and the public condition <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> to be--what it was.|$|R
5|$|Later, but not {{precisely}} dated, eruptions from the Lassen volcanic area have formed over 30 smaller steep-sided, mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called lava domes. Crescent Crater, which {{at first glance}} appears as a parasite on Lassen's northeast flank, has been more heavily glaciated and thus is older. Other dacite domes which rose on Tehama's flanks are Bumpass Mountain, Helen Ridge, Eagle Peak, Vulcan's Castle and Reading Peak. An upper limit of 10,000years has been set for the domes next to Lost Creek (north domes). All of these domes must <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> with great rapidity.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} of Littlewoods {{television}} advertisements featured Constantine and Woodall as themselves dressed as two agents trying to rob a Littlewoods designer warehouse, which {{was followed by}} Christmas adverts in 2007. The £12 million advertising campaign is one of largest ever for a home shopping and internet-based company. Since the campaign began, Littlewoods' sales <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> by 18 per cent, with brand awareness and customers visiting the website rising as well.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2003–04, Heskey {{signed for}} Birmingham City on 18 May 2004 on a five-year {{contract}} for an initial £3.5million fee, which could <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> to £6.25million, and would thus have become Birmingham's most expensive player. He suffered an ankle injury during a pre-season friendly against CA Osasuna, which put his Premier League debut against Portsmouth in doubt. He was eventually able to play against Portsmouth on 14 August, and the match ended as a 1–1 draw. His first goal came with a header in the eighth minute against Manchester City, which was enough to earn a 1–0 victory on 24 August. Despite Birmingham's mediocre 2004–05 season, Heskey was named as the club's Player's Player of the Season, Fan's Player of the Season, finished as top goalscorer with 11 goals and won most man of the match awards.|$|E

5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The decree {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would <b>have</b> <b>risen.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} {{from one of the}} F-16's original raison d'etre recent costs for both new and refurbished aircraft <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> significantly from its 1998 fly-away cost of $18.8 million. In 2011, Iraq ordered 18 F-16IQ (Block 52) for $3 billion, an average cost of $165 million per unit. In 2014, the United Arab Emirates ordered 30 F-16s Block 60 aircraft with the average cost of $200 million. In 2017, Romania purchased 12 refurbished used F-16A/Bs from Portugal for a total of €628 million, roughly $680 million, an average cost of $56 million. This cost led the Polish deputy minister for national defence Bartosz Kownacki to counsel against buying used F-16s, saying that buying a new F-35 would be better value. In March 2017, the US government released plans to sell 19 new F-16s with 23 engines, radars, and armament to Bahrain for total cost of $4.867 billion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, {{acquisitions}} {{have become increasingly}} difficult for the National Gallery as the prices for Old Masters – {{and even more so}} for the Impressionists and Post-impressionists – <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> beyond its means. Some of the Gallery's most significant purchases in this period would have been impossible without the major public appeals backing them, including The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist by Leonardo da Vinci (bought in 1962) and Titian’s Death of Actaeon (1972). The Gallery's purchase grant from the government was frozen in 1985, but later that year it received an endowment of £50 million from Sir Paul Getty, enabling many major purchases to be made. In April 1985 Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover and his brothers, the Hon. Simon Sainsbury and Sir Timothy Sainsbury, had made a donation that would enable the construction of the Sainsbury Wing.|$|E
