However, this energy attrition was absent both in the OPERA experiment and in the colocated ICARUS experiment, which uses the same CNGS beam as OPERA.

CLEO and CUSB published their first papers back-to-back, reporting observation of the first three Υ states. Earlier claims of the Υ(3S) relied on fits of one peak with three components; CLEO and CUSB's observation of three well separated peaks dispelled any remaining doubt about the existence of the Υ(3S). The Υ(4S) was discovered shortly after by CLEO and CUSB and was interpreted as decaying to B mesons because of its large decay width. An excess of <b>electrons</b> <b>and</b> <b>muons</b> [...] at the Υ(4S) demonstrated the existence of weak decays and confirmed the interpretation of the Υ(4S) decaying to B mesons.

50|$|Cornell University {{had built}} a series of {{synchrotron}}s since the 1940s. The 10 GeV synchrotron in operation during the 1970s had conducted a number of experiments, but it ran at much lower energy than the 20 GeV linear accelerator at SLAC. As late as October 1974, Cornell planned to upgrade the synchrotron to reach energies of 25 GeV and build a new synchrotron to reach 40 GeV. After {{the discovery of the}} J/&Psi; in November 1974 demonstrated that interesting physics could be done with an electron-positron collider, Cornell submitted a proposal in 1975 for an electron-positron collider operating up to center-of-mass energies of 16 GeV using the existing synchrotron tunnel. An accelerator at 16 GeV would explore the energy region between that of the SPEAR accelerator and the PEP and PETRA accelerators. CESR and CLEO were approved in 1977 and mostly finished by 1979. CLEO was built in the large experimental hall {{at the south end of}} CESR; a smaller detector named CUSB (for Columbia University-Stony Brook) was built at the north interaction region. Between the proposal for and construction of CESR and CLEO, Fermilab discovered the Υ resonances and suggested that as many as three states existed. The Υ(1S) and Υ(2S) were confirmed at the DORIS accelerator. The first order of business once CESR was running was to find the Υs. CLEO and CUSB found the Υ(1S) shortly after beginning to collect data, and used the mass difference from DORIS to quickly find the Υ(2S). CESR's higher beam energies allowed CLEO and CUSB to find the more massive Υ(3S) and discover the Υ(4S). Furthermore, the presence of an excess of <b>electrons</b> <b>and</b> <b>muons</b> at the Υ(4S) indicated that it decayed to B mesons. CLEO proceeded to publish over sixty papers using the original CLEO I configuration of the detector.|$|E

It lowers η_eμ and leads to the non-standard temperature behavior η_eμ∝ T^- 5 / 3.

Both viscosities, η_eμ and η_n, can be important, and both are calculated including the effects of proton superfluidity. They are presented in the form valid for any equation of state of nucleon dense matter. We analyze the density and temperature dependence of η for different equations of state in neutron star cores, and compare η with the bulk viscosity in the core and with the shear viscosity in the crust.
