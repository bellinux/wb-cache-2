5|$|Combinatorial {{game theory}} {{provides}} alternative reals as well, with infinite Blue-Red Hackenbush as one particularly relevant example. In 1974, Elwyn Berlekamp described a correspondence between Hackenbush strings and binary expansions of real numbers, {{motivated by the}} idea of data compression. For example, the value of the Hackenbush string LRRLRLRL... is 0.0101012...=. However, the value of LRLLL... (corresponding to 0.111...2) is infinitesimally less than 1. The <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> is the surreal number , where ω is the first infinite ordinal; the relevant game is LRRRR... or 0.000...2. follows directly from Berlekamp's Rule.|$|E

A floppy disk version was created to accommodate consumers that had yet to purchase CD-ROM drives. The CD-ROM format afforded the addition of audible dialog. The capacity <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> formats necessitated alterations to the floppy disk version. Grossman spent several weeks reducing files sizes and removing files such as the audio dialog to fit the game onto six diskettes.|$|E
5|$|In {{homodyne}} detection, {{the interference}} occurs between two beams {{at the same}} wavelength (or carrier frequency). The phase <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> beams results in {{a change in the}} intensity of the light on the detector. The resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded. Most of the interferometers discussed in this article fall into this category.|$|E
5|$|In the Milky Way it {{has been}} {{discovered}} that {{the large majority of}} the low metallicity clusters are aligned along a plane in the outer part of the galaxy's halo. This result argues in favor of the view that type II clusters in the galaxy were captured from a satellite galaxy, rather than being the oldest members of the Milky Way's globular cluster system as had been previously thought. The <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.|$|E

5|$|Inside the case, {{there were}} many more {{similarities}} with the ZX81. Like its successor, it used the Z80A microprocessor and had only 1KB of on-board RAM. It came with a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display. It relied on an ordinary cassette tape recorder for data storage. The main <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> machines lay in the internal software; when the ZX81 was released, ZX80 owners were able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of plugging a new ROM onto the circuit board.|$|E
5|$|Phreatomagmatic eruptions are eruptions {{that arise}} from {{interactions}} between water and magma. They are driven from thermal contraction (as opposed to magmatic eruptions, which are driven by thermal expansion) of magma when it comes in contact with water. This temperature <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> causes violent water-lava interactions {{that make up the}} eruption. The products of phreatomagmatic eruptions are believed to be more regular in shape and finer grained than the products of magmatic eruptions because of the differences in eruptive mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Some mycologists {{classify}} C.violaceus as {{two distinct}} species—Cortinarius violaceus and Cortinarius hercynicus, with hercynicus {{relating to the}} Hercynian Forest region of southern Germany. These species are differentiated morphologically by the latter population's rounder spores. Persoon had described C.hercynicus as a separate species in 1794, though Fries regarded it as conspecific with C.violaceus. Moser separated them once again as species in 1967, and Norwegian biologist Tor Erik Brandrud classified C.hercynicus as a subspecies of C.violaceus in 1983. However, Harrower and colleagues, on limited molecular testing, found no genetic or ecological <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> taxa.|$|E

5|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} {{was discovered}} by Heinrich Kuhl in Java, Indonesia. The population of this species is greatly debatable due to the five different species of rays in Indonesia. Also, {{there are two different}} subgroups: the Java and Bali form. The distinct <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> strains is their size, with the Bali being much larger than the Java. On the familial level, the family Dasyatidae is made up of 9 genera and 70 species. The genus of Neotrygon are called maskrays, because of the color pattern around their eyes.|$|E
5|$|The caracal {{is often}} {{confused}} with the lynx, as both cats have tufted ears. However, a notable point of <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> is that the lynx is spotted and blotched, while the caracal shows no such markings on the coat. The African golden cat has a similar build as the caracal's, but is darker and lacks the ear tufts. The sympatric serval can be told apart from the caracal by the former's lack of ear tufts, white spots behind the ears, spotted coat, longer legs, longer tail and smaller footprints.|$|E

In a report published in March 2008 by the Wales Audit Office, {{the reason for the}} <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> costs were that the original estimate of £12M was not based on any detailed design of the final requirements of the building. Extra costs of the building were due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks in the United States.|$|E

In 2006, Weksler and colleagues noted tail coloration as a <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> species of Transandinomys (bicolored in T.talamancae and unicolored in T.bolivaris), but in their 1998 study, Musser and colleagues could not find differences in tail coloration between their Panamanian samples of the two species.|$|E

The maximum temperature that the device heated up to was also less than original iPad 2, tests conducted by the same organisation revealed that the upgraded variant was able to operate at 1 degree lower when performing intensive tasks.

5|$|Durio {{sensu lato}} has 30 {{recognised}} species. Durio sensu stricto comprises 24 of these species. The 6 species included in Durio s.l. are now {{considered by some}} to comprise their own genus, Boschia. Durio s.s. and Boschia have indistinguishable vegetative characteristics and many shared floral characteristics. The crucial <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> is that anther locules open by apical pores in Boschia and by longitudinal slits in Durio s.s. These two genera form a clade that is sister to another genus in the tribe Durioneae, Cullenia. These three genera together form a clade that is characterized by highly modified (mono- and polythecate, as opposed to bithecate) anthers.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine waves {{in a way that will}} cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E
