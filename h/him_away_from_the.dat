Khánh, who had played a minor role in Diệm's overthrow, joined forces with Generals Trần Thiện Khiêm, Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, who felt they deserved better posts in the junta, and Colonels Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Đỗ Mậu, the latter being the director of military security under Diệm and an effective strategist.|$|E

5|$|Thomas {{failed in}} spite of his qualities and the {{widespread}} support he had gained, which brought him control of most of the empire. Lemerle holds that several factors played a role in his defeat: the Asian themes he did not subdue supplied reinforcements to Michael; Thomas's fleet performed badly; and the Bulgarian offensive diverted <b>him</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> capital and weakened his army. But the most decisive obstacles were the impregnable walls of Constantinople, which ensured that an emperor who controlled Constantinople could only be overthrown from within the city.|$|E
5|$|From his {{earliest}} involvement in politics, Cleveland {{aligned with the}} Democratic Party. He had a decided aversion to Republicans John Fremont and Abraham Lincoln, and {{the heads of the}} Rogers law firm were solid Democrats. In 1865, he ran for District Attorney, losing narrowly to his friend and roommate, Lyman K. Bass, the Republican nominee. In 1870, with the help of friend Oscar Folsom, Cleveland secured the Democratic nomination for Sheriff of Erie County, New York. He won the election by a 303-vote margin and took office on January 1, 1871 at age 33. While this new career took <b>him</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> practice of law, it was rewarding in other ways: the fees were said to yield up to $40,000 (US$ today) over the two-year term.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, Ramsey was {{approached}} by Robert Oppenheimer and Robert Bacher, who asked him to join the Manhattan Project. Ramsey agreed to do so, but {{the intervention of the}} Project director, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., was necessary in order to prise <b>him</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Secretary of War's office. A compromise was agreed to, whereby Ramsey remained on the payroll of the Secretary of War, and was merely seconded to the Manhattan Project. In October 1943, Group E-7 of the Ordnance Division was created at the Los Alamos Laboratory with Ramsey as group leader, with the task of integrating the design and delivery of the nuclear weapons being built by the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Neither Wetherby nor Clements {{enjoyed the}} support of Governor Chandler. Coupled with this, Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson {{suffered}} a heart attack during the campaign, and as majority whip, Clements assumed the role of acting majority leader. This took <b>him</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> campaign trail for extended periods of time. During the infrequent visits he was able to make to the state, he campaigned for his former lieutenant governor, Wetherby. In the general election, Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65,000 votes and Clements lost to Thruston Ballard Morton by about 7,000 votes. It was the first time Clements had lost a race in thirty years, and Kentucky Democrats would not elect a senator again for another sixteen years.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{pay-per-view}} {{opened with}} the Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) taking on Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster). The Legion of Doom used {{their size and}} power to wear down their opponents in the opening minutes of the match. Money Inc. gained the advantage when Hawk missed a flying clothesline. Hawk tried to tag in his partner but was unable for several minutes because Money Inc. kept <b>him</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> corner where Animal was standing. Eventually, Hawk and Schyster hit {{each other at the}} same time. Hawk tagged Animal in, and the Legion of Doom attempted the Doomsday device, their signature move. Schyster stopped them, but Animal hit Schyster in retaliation, causing Schyster to run into DiBiase. Animal then powerslammed DiBiase and pinned him to get the victory.|$|E

Returned to his own world, A You awakens in the tree he had taken shelter in and heads back to his house, where he finds his worried friends and family waiting for him. A You's experiences at Abi Port inspire him to work harder, and he eventually gets married to his co-worker and friend Su Fei. The two are shown years later at the grand opening of Grandpa Beard's Fun House, a restaurant themed after Grandpa Beard, where A You sees he will accomplish his dream and spread happiness.|$|E
5|$|Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (c. 1275 – 23 June 1324) was a Franco-English nobleman. Though {{primarily}} {{active in}} England, {{he also had}} strong connections with the French royal house. One of the wealthiest and most powerful men of his age, he was a central player in the conflicts between Edward II of England and his nobility, particularly Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster. Pembroke {{was one of the}} Lords Ordainers appointed to restrict the power of Edward II and his favourite Piers Gaveston. His position changed with the great insult he suffered when Gaveston, as a prisoner in his custody whom he had sworn to protect, was removed and beheaded on the instigation of Lancaster. This led Pembroke into close and lifelong cooperation with the King. Later in life, however, political circumstances combined with financial difficulties would cause him problems, driving <b>him</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> centre of power.|$|E
5|$|The growing family, {{which came}} to include eight children, spent its winters in Berlin and summers in Potsdam; the year also usually {{included}} a stay in the country, {{to the delight of}} the children. In 1863 Vicky and Frederick purchased a run-down property and refurbished it into a farm, allowing the family to periodically experience a simple country life. Frederick was a loving husband, but as an officer in the Prussian army, his duties increasingly pulled <b>him</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> home. Vicky was an intellectually demanding mother who expected her children to exhibit moral and political leadership, and in her husband's absence she carefully supervised their education and upbringing. Shortly after arriving in her new adopted country, Vicky observed the continuous arguments and intrigues within the Prussian royal family. This bolstered her belief in the superiority of English culture; she raised her children in English-style nurseries, and successfully fostered a love of her native country by incorporating aspects of English culture in the home and taking them on frequent trips to England.|$|E

5|$|The {{match between}} Jerry Lawler's team, known as The Royal Family (with Queasy, Sleazy, and Cheesy), and Doink's Clowns R' Us team (with Dink, Wink, and Pink) {{consisted}} of comedic action {{for much of}} the first ten minutes. Eventually, Doink attempted a crossbody, but Lawler reversed the move. He was able to pin Doink and eliminate him from the match. Lawler remained involved in the match and {{played a role in the}} elimination of two more members of Doink's team. When Wink attempted a monkey flip against Queasy, Lawler blocked the move and helped Queasy to pin Wink. Later in the match, Lawler threw Cheesy on top of Pink, which enabled Cheesy to eliminate another of Doink's teammates. After Wink and Pink were eliminated, however, they hid under the ring rather than returning backstage. The final member of Clowns R' Us was eliminated after Sleazy and Dink fought in the ring. Dink performed a crossbody on Sleazy and attempted to pin him. Queasy rolled the wrestlers over so that Sleazy was on top, however, and the referee made the three count and awarded the match to The Royal Family. As Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy celebrated after the match, Lawler criticized them for taking credit for the victory. Dink, Pink, and Wink emerged from under the ring. All six midgets turned against Lawler and chased <b>him</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ring. As Lawler tried to escape, Doink returned and hit him in the face with a pie.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} {{reactions to}} On the Origin of Species, {{the book in}} which Charles Darwin described evolution by natural selection, included international debate, though the heat of controversy was less than that over earlier works such as Vestiges of Creation.

While Darwin's illness kept <b>him</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> public debates, he read eagerly about them and mustered support through correspondence.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Graz {{took place}} on 24–26 June 1809 between an Austrian corps {{commanded}} by Ignaz Gyulai and a French division led by Jean-Baptiste Broussier. The French were soon reinforced by a corps under Auguste Marmont. The battle is considered a French victory though Gyulai was successful in getting supplies to the Austrian garrison of Graz before the two French forces drove <b>him</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city.

In Paris the grand duke excited public ridicule by the manifestation of his petty military fads.
