5|$|Scaly-breasted munias have {{variable}} competitive {{behaviors that}} allow them to exploit scarce resources. There are two foraging alternatives: producers that make the food available and scroungers that steal food found by the producers. Studies show that these choices lead to a stable equilibrium within a group. When individuals are free to choose between producer and scrounger, frequency dependent selection results in a stable mixture of both behaviors where each receives similar payoff. Studies indicate that if most of the population consists of producers, then scrounging behavior <b>is</b> <b>favored</b> by natural selection because there is plenty of food to steal. On the other hand, if most birds exhibit scrounging then the competition for stealing is so great that producing <b>is</b> <b>favored.</b>|$|E
5|$|While growing, Azotobacter {{produces}} flat, slimy, paste-like colonies with {{a diameter}} of 5–10mm, which may form films in liquid nutrient media. The colonies can be dark-brown, green, or other colors, or may be colorless, depending on the species. The growth <b>is</b> <b>favored</b> at a temperature of 20–30°C.|$|E
5|$|In the thelytokous ant Platythyrea punctata, colonies are clonal; therefore, {{workers are}} all equally related genetically, and worker {{policing}} {{is not expected}} {{as there is no}} genetic conflict. However, one would expect severe effects on the condition of the colony if reproductive workers were left unchecked. For example, more time spent on individual reproduction would be predicted to detract from care of the queen's offspring. In studies of these ants, workers did actually display worker policing, as evidenced by increased aggression towards reproductive workers. Worker policing here <b>is</b> <b>favored</b> for group efficiency.|$|E
50|$|This {{was just}} the fifth time in Super Bowl history when a lower-seeded team opened as the {{favorite}} to win; the previous occurrences were Super Bowls XXXIX (AFC second-seeded New England Patriots <b>were</b> <b>favored</b> by seven points over NFC top-seed Philadelphia Eagles), XXXV (AFC fourth-seeded Baltimore Ravens <b>were</b> <b>favored</b> by three points over NFC top-seed New York Giants), XXIII (NFC second-seeded San Francisco 49ers <b>were</b> <b>favored</b> by seven points over AFC first-seed Cincinnati Bengals), and XVII (AFC second-seeded Miami Dolphins <b>were</b> <b>favored</b> by three points over NFC top-seed Washington Redskins). In each but the last iteration, the lower-seeded and favored team won.|$|R

5000|$|As a rough {{generalization}} {{it can be}} {{said that}} stiff-but-light softwoods <b>are</b> <b>favored</b> for the soundboards or soundboard-like surface that transmits the vibrations of the strings to the ambient air. Hardwoods <b>are</b> <b>favored</b> for the body or framing element of an instrument.|$|R
5|$|The above {{cascade of}} (n,γ) {{reactions}} produces {{a mixture of}} different curium isotopes. Their post-synthesis separation is cumbersome, and therefore a selective synthesis is desired. Curium-248 <b>is</b> <b>favored</b> for research purposes because of its long half-life. The most efficient preparation method of this isotope is via α-decay of the californium isotope 252Cf, which is available in relatively large quantities due to its long half-life (2.65 years). About 35–50mg of 248Cm is being produced by this method every year. The associated reaction produces 248Cm with isotopic purity of 97%.|$|E
5|$|Jerold J. Abrams and Elizabeth F. Cooke, in {{the book}} The Philosophy of TV Noir argue that the episode {{stresses}} abductive reasoning, a type of logic that goes from data or a description of something to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data and seeks to explain relevant evidence. Abductive reasoning follows the logic: a surprising fact, C, is observed (Result); If A, the hypothesis, were true, C would make perfect sense (Rule); Thus, {{there is reason to}} suspect that A is true (Case). An example that has been given is: the lawn is wet. But if it is raining, then it would be unsurprising that the lawn is wet. Therefore, it is raining. This logical method <b>is</b> <b>favored</b> by Mulder throughout most of the show. In this episode, however, it is Scully who first uses the method. She takes three separate facts—the massive size of some types of mushrooms, the hallucinogenic properties of some fungi, and the carnivorous nature of certain types of plants—and formulates an abductive conclusion: she and Mulder are trapped underground, experiencing a hallucination, and slowly being digested.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{dry weather}} at McCarran allows {{operations}} under visual flying rules 99% of the time; visibility falls to marginal and instrument-only conditions less than 1% of the time. During {{most of the}} year (approximately 56% of the time), due to prevailing winds, the airport operates in Visual Configuration 1, which favors 19R and 26L for arrivals and 19L and 26R for departures. Airfield capacity in Configuration 1 is constrained by bordering military airspace, high terrain to the west of McCarran, and an uphill departure from 26R. Because of the heat, 26R <b>is</b> <b>favored</b> over 19L for departures. When the winds shift in the winter (approximately 13% of the year), the airfield adopts Visual Configuration 3, which favors 01L and 26L for arrivals and 01L and 01R for departures. Marginal flying conditions adopt the same Configuration 1/Configuration 3 split based on the prevailing winds. Under instrument flying conditions, arrivals are preferred on 26L, and departures take off from 19L and 26R.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{dispersal}} of seeds, or anemochory, {{is one of}} the more primitive means of dispersal. Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and maples (Acer (genus) spp., Sapindaceae), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or ruderal species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds. A related process to anemochory is anemophily, which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which <b>is</b> <b>favored</b> when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.|$|E
