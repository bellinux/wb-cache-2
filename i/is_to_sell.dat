5|$|REL intends {{ultimately}} {{to operate as}} a for-profit commercial enterprise which, upon the completion of development, shall manufacture Skylon vehicles for multiple international customers who shall operate their fleets directly, while being provided with support from REL. Skylon has been designed with the target of achieving no less than 200 flights per vehicle. According to the company, its business plan <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> vehicles for $1 billion each, for which it has forecast a market for at least 30 Skylons, while recurring costs of just $10 million per flight are predicted to be incurred by operators. While the REL intends to manufacture some components directly, such as the engine precooler, other components have been designed by partner companies and a consortium of various aerospace firms is expected to handle full production of Skylon.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other wine {{regions of}} France (such as Bordeaux), {{winemaking}} in the Cote de Nuits exist {{on a very}} small scale. The typical domaine estate produces from 50 to 1,000 cases of wine a year, {{in contrast to a}} Bordeaux chateau which often makes more than 20,000 cases annually. Vineyards in the area are highly fragmented, with multiple owners each owning pieces of a family. A producer may own only 2 to 3 rows of vines in a vineyard which they could either produce as a separate wine or blend with the production of other similarly small holdings in other vineyards in the region. These blended wines will generally take on a larger scale designation of a village or district-level wines. Those producers who keep the production separate and unblended (such as for a Grand cru or Premier cru level wine) will make several batches of very small quantities of wine that can fetch high prices due to demand for their limited supply. A third option <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the grapes or wine to a negociant who may be able to purchase similar lots from the same vineyard to produce more cases of that Grand cru or Premier cru level wine.|$|E
500|$|With {{regard to}} the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated, [...] "It is {{flawlessly}} crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well." [...] He credited the [...] "technical difficulties" [...] with being [...] "so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion" [...] and [...] "found [...] convinced by both the story and the sad saga". He named it his ninth best film of 1997. On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film received [...] "two thumbs up" [...] and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as [...] "a glorious Hollywood epic" [...] and [...] "well worth the wait," [...] and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio [...] "captivating". James Berardinelli stated, [...] "Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, Titanic {{is the kind of}} epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch Titanic, you experience it." [...] It was named his second best film of 1997. Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that [...] "the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy" [...] and that [...] "when you consider that [...] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron". Joseph McBride of Boxoffice Magazine concluded, [...] "To describe Titanic as the greatest disaster movie ever made <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner {{is one of the most}} magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ogilvy & Mather {{was built}} on David Ogilvy's principles; in particular, that the {{function}} of advertising <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> and that successful advertising for any product is based on information about its consumer.

In 1955, he coined the phrase, [...] "The customer is not a moron, she's your wife" [...] based on these values.|$|E

2500|$|As soon as Miriam leaves, {{the lights}} go out. Annabel stumbles over to the tennis court, and hears her father {{whispering}} [...] "Annabel ... Annabel ..." [...] before being pelted with tennis balls. Then, a soaking and bedraggled Alice emerges from the well. This is finally enough to give Annabel a fatal heart attack. Miriam comes back, checks Annabel's pulse, and she and Alice (or [...] "Lewis", as Miriam now calls her) celebrate {{the success of their}} plan to reclaim the inheritance. The father voice was just a tape recorder, the tennis balls came from a machine, the well was filled in years ago, and the two show every sign that they are in fact a lesbian couple.

2500|$|In his 1927 book, Laufer {{described}} seven {{species of}} crickets {{kept by the}} people of Beijing; Oecanthus rufescens and Homeogryllys japonicus were the favorites based on their [...] "singing" [...] rather than fighting qualities. The most common species sold by Chinese traders in the 21st century are Anaxipha pallidula, Homeoxipha lycoides, Gryllus bimaculatus. Velarifictorus micado from Shandong is especially prized. Ningjin peasants collect only the Velarifictorus species and discard the abundant Teleogryllus emma and Loxoblemmus doenitzii, which are not used in cricket fighting. Peasants usually cannot even remotely estimate the probable market value of the catch. At best, they can sort crickets by size; their objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the catch to the wholesalers as soon as possible. They offload their catch at the local roadside markets (daji) in the early morning, immediately after the night shift. They frequently overstate their selling skills: many crickets remain unsold and are discarded.|$|E
2500|$|Although DRM is {{prevalent}} for Internet music, some online music {{stores such as}} eMusic, Dogmazic, Amazon, and Beatport, do not use DRM despite encouraging {{users to}} avoid sharing music. Major labels have begun releasing more music without DRM. Eric Bangeman suggests in Ars Technica that {{this is because the}} record labels are [...] "slowly beginning to realize that they can't have DRMed music and complete control over the online music market at the same time... One way to break the cycle <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> music that is playable on any digital audio player. eMusic does exactly that, and their surprisingly extensive catalog of non-DRMed music has vaulted it into the number two online music store position behind the iTunes Store." [...] Apple's Steve Jobs called on the music industry to eliminate DRM in an open letter titled Thoughts on Music. Apple's iTunes Store will start to sell DRM-free 256 kbit/s (up from 128 kbit/s) AAC encoded music from EMI for a premium price (this has since reverted to the standard price).|$|E

2500|$|Another such episode {{details the}} boy's {{trip on the}} {{outskirts}} of the village, sent over to provide food for the Romani day laborers hired by Ștefan and Smaranda. This episode sees the boy's unsupervised encounter with the village hoopoe (or [...] "Armenian cuckoo"). Miserable over having to wake up early every morning to the sound of the bird, Nică exercises his revenge by trapping the bird inside her nest, a time-consuming process which drives the awaiting and isolated laborers to despair. Met with much hostility by his father's employees when he ultimately reaches his destination, the boy makes his way back to the hoopoe's lime tree and easily ties up the exhausted bird, hiding her in the attic of his house, where it no longer can sing. His deed proves detrimental to the entire community, deprived of its alarm clock, and rumors quickly spread that Nică is responsible. While Smaranda decides whether she should trust these reports, the boy assesses that the his best choice <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the hoopoe at the fair. He proceeds to do so, but his entire scheme crumbles once a sly old man, pretending to assess the bird, releases it from its bonds. As the bird flies back to her nest, Nică angrily demands reparation. He is instead ridiculed by the old man, who informs him that Ștefan is also attending the fair and might be interested in the conversation, thus exposing the boy and prompting him to rush out of the market in fear of more severe repercussion.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial venues {{may provide}} {{amenities}} such as bathrooms, picnic areas, lockers, equipment rentals, air refills and food service. Countries may have paintball sports guidelines, with rules on specific safety and insurance standards, and paid staff (including referees) who must ensure players are instructed in proper play to ensure participants' safety. Some fields are [...] "BYOP" [...] (Bring Your Own Paint), allowing players to buy paint at unrelated retail stores or online {{and use it}} at their field. However, most fields are FPO (Field Paint Only,) meaning players must buy paint at the venue or at a pro shop affiliated with the park. This is largely for revenue reasons; field and rental fees generally do not cover expenses of a paintball park. However, other reasons relating to player safety are generally cited and have some merit, as poor quality or poorly stored paint can cause gun failures or personal injury to targeted players. Other times, FPO policies are in keeping with municipal laws for wastewater and runoff; paintballs contain food dyes, and some formulations have metallic flakes and/or cornstarch {{to make them more}} visible, all of which can pose problems in water reservoirs and treatment plants. So, fields that must wash paintball paint into municipal wastewater facilities, or that have substantial rain runoff into bodies of water that are used as sources of drinking water, are generally required by the municipality to restrict players to only certain paint formulations; the easiest way to achieve this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> only approved paint and require that field paint be used.|$|E
