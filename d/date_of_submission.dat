After class, Edna and Principal Skinner's apple picking date is cancelled when Skinner's mother, Agnes, interrupts. At the Simpson house, Bart is distracted from writing his paper, {{and at the end}} of the three weeks, he still has not started the assignment. The day before the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>submission,</b> he asks Grampa for help. Edna rejects Bart's paper and tells him that he will have to do it correctly after school. As Bart finishes the assignment after school, supervised by Edna herself, he observes Skinner cancel a movie date with Edna when Agnes calls. Bart consoles Edna, and she reluctantly accepts his offer to accompany her to the movie.|$|E

60|$|Sir,--I {{told you}} in my last that the Consuls had tinkered up a treaty of peace with the rebels of Aána. A month has gone by, and I would not weary readers your with a story so {{intricate}} and purposeless. The Consuls seem to have gone backward and forward, to and fro. To periods of agitated activity, {{comparable to that of}} three ants about a broken nest, there succeeded seasons in which they rested from their labours and ruefully considered the result. I believe I am not overstating the case when I say that this treaty was at least twice rehandled, and the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>submission</b> changed, in the interval. And yesterday at length we beheld the first-fruits of the Consular diplomacy. A boat came in from Aána bearing the promised fifty stand of arms--in other words, a talking man, a young chief, and some boatmen in charge of a boat-load of broken ironmongery. The Government (well advised for once) had placed the Embassy under an escort of German blue-jackets, or I think it must have gone ill with the Ambassadors.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{analyzes}} {{the measure of}} academic procrastination among students and the measure of general procrastination among working population with a university degree. The thesis includes 3 studies. In study 1 an experiment was conducted on 33 students of the University of Economics in Prague. The results show, that students achieve better academic results given external, evenly distributed deadlines compared to when {{they are allowed to}} set the deadlines themselves. The second study analyses long-term data about 1909 students of the University of Economics and their academic results. The results show that procrastination can influence as much as 8 % of the final grade. Study 3 analyzes information about 2487 subjects and their tax-return forms. It puts into context the <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> the tax returns and personal characteristics of the submitters. The results show that procrastination declines with age.

40|$|Introduction: Neck pain {{is common}} {{and is a}} {{significant}} medical and socioeconomic problem in New Zealand. There are many treatments for neck pain, however the effectiveness of manual treatment for neck pain is poorly established. The aim {{of the present study}} is to document the effectiveness of an emergent manual therapeutic technique Simple Contact in five subjects suffering from chronic neck pain. Methods: A prospective single-system research design using an A-B-C protocol was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the intervention Simple Contact in reducing levels of pain intensity, disability due to neck pain and fear avoidance behaviour, and increasing functional status levels. Subjects satisfying the study inclusion and exclusion criteria commenced a 9 - 10 week study consisting of a 3 - 4 week baseline period followed by a 3 week intervention period and a 3 week follow-up period. Outcome measures used to record levels were Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale, Neck Disability Index, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire and Patient Specific Functional Scale. Results: Visual analysis of the data was used to attempt to identify any change in outcome measures that might be due to the intervention. Where relevant, trendlines were fitted to data from all three phases and to data from the intervention and followup phases. Variability of data and limited data points in the baseline phase make it difficult to conclude whether or not the intervention had an effect. Electronic <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> results by subjects allowed subject compliance to be checked. Poor compliance with scheduled <b>dates</b> for <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> data seriously weakens the integrity of the study and the ability to confidently draw conclusions from the results. This identifies a methodological weakness for studies reliant on self-report measures of change. Conclusions: The current research was not able to make conclusions as to the effectiveness of the intervention Simple Contact on reducing levels of chronic neck pain in the five subjects studied. However, visual analyses of the results suggest that the intervention was having no detectable effect on the outcomes measured. Future research in this area should attempt to obtain more baseline data and maximise compliance with scheduled <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> data by subjects...|$|R
