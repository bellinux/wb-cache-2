25|$|The {{existence}} of camels in Mesopotamia {{but not in}} Israel <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> idea. The historian Richard Bulliet {{did not think that}} the occasional mention of camels meant that the domestic camels were common in the Holy Land at that time. The archaeologist William F. Albright writing even earlier saw camels in the Bible as an anachronism.|$|E
25|$|Although {{melanoma}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> disease, {{evidence for}} its occurrence in antiquity is rather scarce. However, one example {{lies in a}} 1960s examination of nine Peruvian mummies, radiocarbon dated to be approximately 2400 years old, which showed apparent signs of melanoma: melanotic masses in the skin and diffuse metastases to the bones.|$|E
25|$|Notation <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{concept in}} Indian music. However, Carnatic music {{continued}} to be transmitted orally for centuries without being written down. The disadvantage with this system was that if one wanted to learn about a kriti composed, for example, by Purandara Dasa, it involved {{the difficult task of}} finding a person from Purandara Dasa's lineage of students.|$|E

25|$|The {{distinction}} between a county for purposes of the Lieutenancy and a county for administrative purposes <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> one: in some cases a county corporate {{that was part of}} a county was appointed its own Lieutenant (although the Lieutenant of the containing county would often be appointed to this position as well), and the three Ridings of Yorkshire had been treated as three counties for Lieutenancy purposes since the 17th century.|$|E

A 14th century plague epidemic in Asia Minor that eventually {{became known as}} the Black Death (carried by fleas) is one such event that has drawn attention from historians as a possible early incident of entomological warfare. That plague's spread over Europe may have been the result of a biological attack on the Crimean city of Kaffa.|$|E

Nanoparticles are typically smaller than 100 nanometres in diameter, yet most of the particles in food grade titanium dioxide are much larger.|$|E

25|$|The {{commuter}} ferry <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> idea. Tradition {{has it that}} Native Americans regularly {{crossed the}} Hudson River at the point between what is now Beacon and Newburgh, long before Europeans arrived in America. In 1743, an “official” ferry was established when Alexander Colden received a royal charter from King George II to carry passengers and goods for profit. The right to operate ferries between Beacon and Newburgh was bestowed upon the Ramsdell family by the heirs of Alexander Colden. They ran the ferry through the Steamboat Era until 1956 when NYSBA took over ferry services.|$|E
25|$|In {{the text}} an amulet is inscribed {{with the names}} of three angels (Senoy, Sansenoy, and Semangelof) and placed around the neck of newborn boys in order to protect them from the lilin until their circumcision. The amulets used against Lilith that were thought to derive from this {{tradition}} are, in fact, dated as being much older. The concept of Eve having a predecessor is not exclusive to the Alphabet, and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> concept, as it can be found in Genesis Rabbah. However, the idea that Lilith was the predecessor may be exclusive to the Alphabet.|$|E
25|$|Necessity. Corporate tree-planting <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> idea; farming {{operations}} {{have been used}} by companies making paper from trees for a long time. If farmed trees are replanted, and the products made from them are placed into landfills rather than recycled, a very safe, efficient, economical and time-proven method of geological sequestration of greenhouse carbon {{is the result of the}} paper product use cycle. This only holds if the paper in the land fill is not decomposted. In most landfills, this is the case and leads to the fact that more than half of the greenhouse gas emissions from the life cycle of paper products occur from landfill methane emissions.|$|E

Since 1820, however, dancing assemblies have {{been the focus of}} the society's annual events.|$|R
50|$|Flyers <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> medium: {{prior to}} the War of American Independence some colonists were outraged with the Stamp Act (1765) and {{gathered}} together in anti-stamp act congresses and meetings. In these congresses they had to win support, and issued handbills and leaflets, pamphlets, along with other written paraphernalia, to do so.|$|R
2500|$|Although his match {{cannot be}} traced, it is {{interesting}} that Beldham described the ground at White Conduit Fields as [...] "new" [...] because it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> venue, although perhaps <b>a</b> <b>new</b> area of it had been designated for use by the WCC.

25|$|While the {{possibility}} that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently. The {{study was conducted with}} a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper. Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, nor did she have any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard intelligence test, and her working memory was evaluated and found to be normal. However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years. Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, it sounds like noise and evokes a stressful response.|$|E
25|$|Biggeri and Mehrotra {{have studied}} the {{macroeconomic}} factors that encourage child labour. They focus their study on five Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines. They suggest that child labour {{is a serious problem}} in all five, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> problem. Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour supply side, they suggest that the growth of low-paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, sise of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.|$|E
25|$|Unions {{have made}} some {{attempts}} to organize across borders. Eder observes that transnational organizing <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> phenomenon but has been facilitated by technological change. Nevertheless, he claims that while unions pay lip service to global solidarity, they still act largely in their national self-interest. He argues that unions in the global North are becoming increasingly depoliticized while those in the South grow politically, and that global differentiation of production processes leads to divergent strategies and interests in {{different regions of the}} world. These structural differences tend to hinder effective global solidarity. However, in light of the weakness of international labor, Herod writes that globalization of production need not be met by a globalization of union strategies in order to be contained. Herod also points out that local strategies, such as the United Auto Workers' strike against General Motors in 1998, can sometimes effectively interrupt global production processes in ways that they could not before the advent of widespread market integration. Thus, workers need not be connected organizationally to others around the world to effectively influence the behavior of a transnational corporation.|$|E
