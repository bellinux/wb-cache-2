5|$|In 1982, the United States Football League {{formed as}} a spring league, and enjoyed {{moderate}} success during its first two seasons behind such stars as <b>Jim</b> <b>Kelly</b> and Herschel Walker. In 1985, the league, which lost {{a considerable amount of}} money due to overspending on players, opted to gamble on moving its schedule to fall in 1986 and filing a billion-dollar antitrust lawsuit against the NFL in an effort to stay afloat. When the lawsuit only drew a three-dollar judgment, the USFL folded.|$|E

5|$|The win set {{up another}} rematch for the Giants, {{this time in}} the Super Bowl against the Buffalo Bills. Throughout the 1990 season, the Bills' {{emergence}} as a championship caliber team {{had been one of the}} largest storylines. The Bills had a cutting edge, no-huddle offense, led by head coach Marv Levy, quarterback <b>Jim</b> <b>Kelly,</b> running back Thurman Thomas, wide receiver Andre Reed and an offensive line led by Kent Hull. They had also recorded a 13–3 record during the 1990 season, culminating with a 51–3 victory over the Los Angeles Raiders in the AFC Championship game. Heading into the game the Bills were installed as seven point favorites.|$|E
5|$|After the Virginia Tech kickoff {{and a short}} return, Miami {{began the}} first drive of the game at its 32-yard line. The game's first play was an {{incomplete}} pass from Miami quarterback <b>Jim</b> <b>Kelly.</b> After a one-yard rush, Kelly completed his first pass of the game, an 18-yard toss that drove Miami to the Tech 49-yard line and gave the Hurricanes a first down. Miami then committed a 15-yard penalty, pushing the Hurricanes back into {{their side of the}} field. On the second play after the penalty, Kelly completed a 29-yard pass that gave Miami a first down. The Hurricanes were further aided by a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty against Virginia Tech, giving Miami a first down at the Tech 20-yard line. From there, it took Miami just three plays to score a touchdown, the final play being a 15-yard pass from Kelly to Larry Brodsky. With 12:37 remaining in the quarter, Miami took a 70 lead.|$|E
5|$|The Patriots and the Bills {{were both}} charter {{members of the}} AFL, and even competed {{with each other in}} an AFL playoff game. They have {{remained}} divisional rivals since the NFL-AFL merger. Prior to the rise of Tom Brady, the two teams shared a mellow, yet occasionally competitive rivalry, featuring highlights from players such as O.J. Simpson, Steve Grogan, Joe Ferguson, <b>Jim</b> <b>Kelly,</b> and Drew Bledsoe. However, Brady has dominated the Bills ever since taking over as the Patriots' franchise quarterback, holding a 26-3 regular season record over them. Though Patriots fans usually feel apathetic towards the Bills, Bills fans have come to despise the Patriots more than any other rival. The rivalry has remained somewhat intense in recent years with multiple players having played for both teams, the Bills usually giving their all when playing the Patriots, and the presence of Rex Ryan, who coached both the Bills and Jets and was known for his trash-talk.|$|E
50|$|During halftime, {{longtime}} quarterback <b>Jim</b> <b>Kelly's</b> {{name was}} added to the Bills Wall of Fame, and his number 12 jersey was retired.
