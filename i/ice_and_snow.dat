5|$|On 16 February 1980, a Britannia 253F of Redcoat Air Cargo crashed at Billerica, Massachusetts, {{shortly after}} {{taking off from}} Boston. The {{probable}} cause of the accident was degraded aerodynamic performance beyond the flight capabilities of the aircraft resulting from an accumulation of <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> on the airframe before takeoff and a further accumulation of ice when the aircraft was flown into moderate to severe icing conditions following takeoff. Contributing {{to the cause of}} the accident were encounters with wind shear, downdrafts, and turbulence during the climb. Of eight crew and passengers on board, there were seven fatalities with one seriously injured.|$|E
5|$|As the {{secondary}} storm began to intensify offshore, precipitation rapidly expanded and tracked northward towards southern Virginia, eastern Maryland and Delaware, {{largely in the}} form of freezing rain, <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b> From 0200 UTC on December 30 to 1200 UTC, the cyclone intensified by 13 mbar, and continued to deepen for several more hours. Snowfall reached southern New Jersey between 0600 and 0800 UTC, and New York City at around 1000 UTC. Thundersnow developed within heavy bands in some areas. The significant snow was characterized by a sharp western cutoff; for example, in Chester County, accumulations ranged from around 6inches in the far eastern parts of the county to only an inch along its western border with Lancaster County.|$|E

5|$|Facing continual {{threats from}} the Acrocanthosaurus, Red, {{her sister and}} the chicks are forced up into the mountains. They {{encounter}} <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> for the first time, and kill a segnosaur in a cave, turning the den into their nest. The older chick accompanies the two adults on hunting expeditions. One day the raptors encounter a strange creature they have never seen—a whip-tailed diplodocid who inflicts wounds on Red and her sister; the older chick is forced to set off alone and find the pack's food. This calamity coincides {{with the arrival of}} a large pack of smaller raptors known as Deinonychus. Sensing the weakness of the Utahraptor pack, they surround the nest and wait for the wounded raptors to become weak enough to attack.|$|E
5|$|In Virginia, some Carolina wrens populations show {{high levels}} of mercury in their blood and this is {{acquired}} from feeding all-year-round on spiders. Spiders being at a higher trophic levels contain a higher concentrations of mercury (through biomagnification) than herbivorous invertebrates. As these wrens are year-round residents, they are at a higher risk than other species to acquire mercury in its blood. Nest abandonment and failure to raise young were more common with higher mercury content. Exposure, and prolonged periods of cold, <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> is thought to affect the wren nestling and adult populations, respectively. Wrens that outlast those winters reside in sheltered areas during the season.|$|E
5|$|Upper Paleolithic people {{specialized}} in organized, group hunting of large mammals; they sometimes pursued and drove entire herds into traps. Their nutritional needs were met largely by meat consumption, as the vegetation {{was limited to}} tundra and steppe and the land was covered by <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> (Vistula final glaciation) for long periods. More sophisticated tool making methods resulted {{in the production of}} long (some over two feet), narrow and sharp flintstone splits. In a cave near Nowy Targ (East-Gravettian culture), a 30,000-year-old boomerang, the world's oldest, was found. It is a crescent-shaped 70cm long object with a fine finish, made of mammoth tusk. Mammoths were hunted in the Kraków area during 25,000-20,000 BCE. Also 30,000 years old are the so-called Mladeč-type blades of the Aurignacian culture, made of bone, found in Wierzchowie, Kraków County.|$|E

50|$|Off-roading {{is always}} related to driving off the pavement, making it {{important}} to maintain proper traction in all road conditions such as mud, dirt, rocks, sand, ice or snow. It is recommended to use appropriate tires on each terrain type {{to get the most}} effective traction. Continuous track is often used in extreme road conditions when regular wheels can't provide enough traction for moving forward. Tracks may be used on sand, <b>ices</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b>|$|R

5|$|From 1932 to 1992, Birkebeinerrittet, a mass ski {{marathon}} between Rena and Lillehammer, {{has used}} Stampesletta as a start or goal area, depending on if the race ran from Lillehammer to Rena {{or in the}} opposite direction. Since 1992, the goal area was moved to Birkebeineren Ski Stadium. Birkebeinerrittet, a cycle version of the ski marathon, has its goal area at Stampesletta. The half-marathon terrain race Birkebeinerløpet uses Stampesletta as its start and goal area. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Stampesletta was used for medal ceremonies for all non-skating events. The backdrops for the podium was built using <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow,</b> with the podium itself being made from ice from the glacier Jostedalsbreen. This contrasted with the surrounding pine elements. Attendance was free, and between 25,000 and 30,000 people attended the medal ceremonies. Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics. The Stampesletta area {{will be used for}} the opening and closing ceremonies with a spectator capacity of 6,000 to 8,000; existing and new buildings nearby will be used for the Olympic Village.|$|E
5|$|Once in the Klondike, {{very few}} women—less than one percent—actually worked as miners. Many {{were married to}} miners; however, their lives as {{partners}} on the gold fields were still hard and often lonely. They had extensive domestic duties, including thawing <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> for water, breaking up frozen food, chopping wood and collecting wild foods. In Dawson and other towns, some women took in laundry to make money. This was a physically demanding job, but could be relatively easily combined with child care duties. Others took jobs in the service industry, for example as waitresses or seamstresses, which could pay well, but were often punctuated by periods of unemployment. Both men and women opened roadhouses, but women {{were considered to be}} better at running them. A few women worked in the packing trade, carrying goods on their backs, or became domestic servants.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake chase The Lich through a {{dimensional}} portal where they meet Prismo, a wish granter, who tells them that the Lich wished for the extinction of all life. This leads Finn to wish that the Lich had never existed. Finn is then transported to an alternate timeline, {{where he is a}} normal human living with his family and his dog, Jake, on a farm. In the alternate reality, Finn discovers a magical ice crown, which he attempts to use to repay his family's debt. After placing it on his head, he is magically imbued with power over <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b> Prismo tells Jake that if he can change The Lich's original wish, everything will go back to normal. Jake—with help from Prismo—eventually wishes that the Lich had actually desired for Finn and Jake to return home. Thus, the world is righted again.|$|E

5|$|Anna is {{the younger}} {{child in the}} royal family of Arendelle, whose older sister, Elsa is born {{with the power to}} create and control <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b> As children, they enjoy the life of princesses using Elsa's {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland for their enjoyment. After they create a snowman named Olaf in the throne room, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna unconscious with her magic. The king and queen hurriedly take Anna to the mountain trolls for help. The troll king, Pabbie, erases Anna's memory of her sister's magic, nulling Elsa's power, only leaving memory of the fun the sisters shared. Pabbie warns Elsa to control her powers—a strike to Anna's heart would have been fatal. In an effort to protect Anna, the king and queen lock the castle gates and generally restrict Elsa to her new separate bedroom. Confused by the sudden loss of contact by Elsa, Anna makes repeated failed attempts to draw her out of her room. Elsa cares too much for her sister, traumatized by the near-death experience and she resists reconnecting with Anna. Eventually, the younger sister ceases trying to rekindle their bond. The sisters become even more isolated from each other after their parents, the King and Queen of Arendelle, die in a shipwreck. Devastated by the news, Anna tries to reunite with her sister, looking for love and comfort in the tragedy. Elsa remains in her room, not attending her parents' funeral.|$|E
5|$|Elsa, {{princess of}} Arendelle and heiress to the throne, is {{born with the}} ability to create and control <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b> As a child, she uses her {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland to play in with her younger sister and best friend, Princess Anna. One night, Elsa accidentally harms Anna with her powers. The king and queen of Arendelle hurriedly take Anna to a tribe of mountain trolls to be healed. While healing Anna, the trolls inform the royals present that Elsa's abilities will grow, becoming both beautiful and very dangerous so she must learn to control them. While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident and of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event. The king and queen take steps to control and hide Elsa's ice powers: the castle gates are locked, Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most of the time, she is given gloves to help suppress her powers and is told to hold in her emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger and so she becomes fearful of harming those she cares about most. Meanwhile, her sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her elder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out of her room. When the sisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which the king and queen are sailing is capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more lonely.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> {{increase}} Earth's albedo, i.e. {{they make}} it reflect more of the sun's energy and absorb less. Hence, when the air temperature decreases, <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> fields grow, and this continues until competition with a negative feedback mechanism forces the system to an equilibrium. Also, the reduction in forests caused by the ice's expansion increases albedo.|$|E

25|$|Many {{possible}} triggering mechanisms {{could account}} for the beginning of a snowball Earth, such as the eruption of a supervolcano, a reduction in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases such as methane and/or carbon dioxide, changes in Solar energy output, or perturbations of Earth's orbit. Regardless of the trigger, initial cooling results in an increase in the area of Earth's surface covered by <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow,</b> and the additional <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> reflects more Solar energy back to space, further cooling Earth and further increasing the area of Earth's surface covered by <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>snow.</b> This positive feedback loop could eventually produce a frozen equator as cold as modern Antarctica.|$|E
