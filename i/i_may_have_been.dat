5|$|The {{magazine}} {{was produced by}} the English printers Hazell, Watson and Viney. One of its owners, Walter Hazell, was a social reformer and supporter of women's suffrage. A successful firm, Hazell, Watson and Viney also produced the Woman's Signal and the Woman's Gazette, which featured female political and economic topics. The success of The Lady's Realm allowed it to remain published for eighteen years, from 1896 to 1915, much longer than many other contemporary women's periodicals. Thirty-six volumes were produced, from November 1896 to October 1914 (a final volume may have been released in 1915). It is not known why it ended, though Versteeg and her colleagues speculate that World War <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a cause, {{as was the case}} for other contemporary publications like Young Woman (1891–1914) and The Girl’s Realm (1892–1915).|$|E
25|$|The period {{just after}} World War <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the Reading Company's best, with {{traffic on the}} Reading at its peacetime high. Annual volume was about 15 million tons of Anthracite, 25 million tons of Bituminous Coal, with a further 30 million tons of {{industrial}} traffic. The Reading had taken great strides to wean itself of anthracite dependency but it still relied heavily on coal revenue, and Pennsylvania anthracite production had peaked in 1917 with 99.7 million tons produced.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to {{the facts of life}} at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

2500|$|Demetrius I (Greek: [...] ) was a Greek king (reigned c. 200–180 BC) of Gandhara. He {{was the son}} of Euthydemus {{and succeeded}} him around 200 BC, after which he conquered {{extensive}} areas in what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan, thus creating an Indo-Greek Kingdom far from Hellenistic Greece. He was never defeated in battle and was posthumously qualified as the Invincible (Aniketos) on the pedigree coins of his successor Agathocles. Demetrius <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the initiator of the Yavana era, starting in 186-185 BC, which was used for several centuries thereafter.|$|E

2500|$|However, modern {{collectors}} and shooters {{have pointed out}} that no Jungle Carbine collector/shooter on any of the prominent internet military firearm collecting forums has reported a confirmed [...] "wandering zero" [...] on their No. 5 Mk I rifle, leading to speculation that the No. 5 Mk <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> phased out largely because the British military did not want a bolt-action rifle when most of the other major militaries were switching over to semi-automatic longarms such as the M1 Garand, SKS, FN Model 1949 and MAS-49. (Anecdotal evidence from shooters of military surplus firearms suggests that the wandering zero problem — if there is one — can be cured by free-floating the barrel and glass-bedding the action.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Cary wrote [...] "there was {{not doubt}} of the {{legality}} of the catch", Jack Fingleton called it [...] "one of the most unfortunate decisions {{in the history of the}} Tests." [...] and most English pressmen shared their view. However, E.W. Swanton reported [...] "The Don waited for the decision, confident that it was a bump ball, and the umpire Borwick, ruled 'not out'". In the Australian dressing rooms the players were divided as to whether he was out or not. When Bradman returned at the end of the session he said he had played down on a yorker and to Ray Lindwall there was no doubt as to his sincerity. In the end the batsman was given the benefit of the doubt, but it had repercussions. Bradman recovered his form and hit 159 runs in 160 minutes before he was out for 187, which set up Australia's victory in the First Test by an innings and 332 runs. This was a morale-booster for a young team with eight debutants, but if Bradman had been out the Australian total would have been less, England would have batted on a flat wicket and the thunderstorm that wrecked the wicket would have caught Australia in their second innings. 'As he walked past Bradman at the end of the over Hammond glared at Bradman and said tensely, [...] "That's a fine way to start a Test series"'. The England captain was furious that Bradman had not walked in what was supposed to be a post-war goodwill tour and refused to talk to him for the rest of the series except to call the toss. To the press he was more diplomatic [...] "I thought it was a catch but the umpire may have been right and <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> wrong" [...] Bradman, 38 years old and suffering from fibrositis, had been advised not to play by his doctor and a cheap dismissal might have made him retire, especially if he had been caught on a sticky wicket in the second innings. Keith Miller later wrote [...] "that decision was subsequently admitted in nearly every quarter to have been erroneous".|$|E
