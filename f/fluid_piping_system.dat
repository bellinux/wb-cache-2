40|$|AbstractThe {{plane wave}} {{assumption}} {{is key to}} the formulation of one dimensional (1 D) and quasi- 2 D water hammer models, which have been widely used in the design and evaluation of <b>fluid</b> <b>piping</b> <b>systems.</b> As transient analysis and utilization {{are becoming more and more}} popular and important to pipe system diagnosis such as pipe faults (leakage and blockage) detection, a better understanding of the influence of plane wave assumption on the transient responses is necessary and critical to the development and application of such innovative technologies. This study aims to (i) address the efficiency problem of existing 2 D scheme, and then extend the full- 2 D water hammer model to a classical reservoir-pipe-valve system so as to simulate the whole process of typical water hammer event; and (ii) estimate the accuracy of plane wave assumption for reproducing pressure histories under both low frequency wave (LFW) and high frequency wave (HFW) conditions. The results confirm that the plane wave assumption is invalid during the period shortly after valve closure, and the influence of radial pressure wave is evident when the incident wave frequency is larger than the radial wave frequency. Moreover, the radial wave dissipation and dispersion rates are highly dependent on the incident wave frequency. This result may provide implication to the utilization of different transient waves (LFW & HFW) for the pipeline assessment in this field...|$|R

The acoustic analysis {{results showed that the}} pulsation amplitudes of most nodes in the outlet <b>piping</b> <b>system</b> exceeded the allowable values. The results of mechanical vibration analyses indicated that the insufficient stiffness of the outlet <b>piping</b> <b>system</b> and the first-order structure resonance occurred on thermowells were also the key factors inducing vibration.

40|$|The Heavy Water Components Test Reactor (HWCTR) {{facility}} (Figure 1) {{was built}} in 1961, operated from 1962 to 1964, and {{is located in the}} northwest quadrant of the Savannah River Site (SRS) approximately three miles from the site boundary. The HWCTR facility is on high, well-drained ground, about 30 meters above the water table. The HWCTR was a pressurized heavy water test reactor used to develop candidate fuel designs for heavy water power reactors. It was not a defense-related facility like the materials production reactors at SRS. The reactor was moderated with heavy water and was rated at 50 megawatts thermal power. In December of 1964, operations were terminated and the facility was placed in a standby condition {{as a result of the}} decision by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission to redirect research and development work on heavy water power reactors to reactors cooled with organic materials. For about one year, site personnel maintained the facility in a standby status, and then retired the reactor in place. In 1965, fuel assemblies were removed, systems that contained heavy water were drained, <b>fluid</b> <b>piping</b> <b>systems</b> were drained, deenergized and disconnected and the spent fuel basin was drained and dried. The doors of the reactor facility were shut and it wasn't until 10 years later that decommissioning plans were considered and ultimately postponed due to budget constraints. In the early 1990 s, DOE began planning to decommission HWCTR again. Yet, in the face of new budget constraints, DOE deferred dismantlement and placed HWCTR in an extended surveillance and maintenance mode. The doors of the reactor facility were welded shut to protect workers and discourage intruders. The $ 1. 6 billion allocation from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to SRS for site clean up at SRS has opened the doors to the HWCTR again - this time for final decommissioning. During the lifetime of HWCTR, 36 different fuel assemblies were tested in the facility. Ten of these experienced cladding failures as operational capabilities of the different designs were being established. In addition, numerous spills of heavy water occurred within the facility. Currently, radiation and radioactive contamination levels are low within HWCTR with most of the radioactivity contained within the reactor vessel. There are no known insults to the environment, however with the increasing deterioration of the facility, the possibility exists that contamination could spread outside the facility if it is not decommissioned. An interior panoramic view of the ground floor elevation taken in August 2009 is shown in Figure 2. The foreground shows the transfer coffin followed by the reactor vessel and control rod drive platform in the center. Behind the reactor vessel is the fuel pool. Above the ground level are the polar crane and the emergency deluge tank at the top of the dome. Note the considerable rust and degradation of the components and the interior of the containment building. Alternative studies have concluded that the most environmentally safe, cost effective option for final decommissioning is to remove the reactor vessel, steam generators, and all equipment above grade including the dome. Characterization studies along with transport models have concluded that the remaining below grade equipment that is left in place including the transfer coffin will not contribute any significant contamination to the environment in the future. The below grade space will be grouted in place. A concrete cover will be placed over the remaining footprint and the groundwater will be monitored for an indefinite period to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. The schedule for completion of decommissioning is late FY 2011. This paper describes the concepts planned in order to remove the major components including the dome, the reactor vessel (RV), the two steam generators (SG), and relocating the transfer coffin (TC) ...|$|R
