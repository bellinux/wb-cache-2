40|$|Data {{from the}} UK Labour Force Survey (LFS) {{are used to}} examine two methodological issues in the {{analysis}} of the relationship between age and work-related health. First, the LFS is unusual in that it asks work-related <b>health</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> those who are not currently employed. This facilitates a more representative analysis than that which is constrained to focus only on those currently in work. Second, information in the LFS facilitates a comparison of work-related health problems that stem from current employment to a more encompassing measure that includes those related to a former job. We find that accounting for each of these sources of bias increases the age work-related health risk gradient, and suggest that ignoring such effects will underestimate the work-related health implications of current policies to extend working lives...|$|E
40|$|AIM/BACKGROUND: To {{describe}} the two-stage prioritization process {{being used by}} the UK National Institute for Health Research's Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care for the South-West Peninsula (or PenCLAHRC) - a joint health service and university partnership and reflect on implications for the wider context of priority setting in health-care research. METHOD: PenCLAHRC's process establishes the priorities of Stakeholders including service users across a regional health system for locally relevant health services research and implementation. Health research questions are collected from clinicians, academics and service users in Devon and Cornwall (UK) using a web-based question formulation tool. There is a two-stage prioritization process which uses explicit criteria and a wide Stakeholder group, including service users to identify important research questions relevant to the south-west peninsula locality. RESULTS: To date, a wide variety of health research topics have been prioritized by the PenCLAHRC Stakeholders. The research agenda reflects the interests of academics, clinicians and service users in the local area. Potential challenges to implementation of the process include time constraints, variable quality of questions (including the language of research) and initiating and maintaining engagement in the process. Shared prioritization of local health research needs can be achieved between Stakeholders {{from a wide range of}} perspectives. CONCLUSIONS: The processes developed have been successful and, with minor changes, will continue to be used during subsequent rounds of prioritization. Engagement of Stakeholders in establishing a research agenda encourages the most relevant <b>health</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> be asked and may improve implementation of research findings and take up by service users...|$|E

40|$|Background. The Expanded Program on Immunization Contact Method (EPI-CM) is a {{proposed}} monitoring and program management tool for developing countries. The method involves health workers tallying responses <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> about <b>health</b> behaviors during routine immunizations and providing targeted counseling. We evaluated whether asking caretakers about health behaviors during EPI visits led {{to changes in}} those behaviors. Methods. We worked in 2 districts in Mali: an intervention district where during immunization visits workers asked about 4 health behaviors related to bed net use, fever, respiratory disease, and diarrhea, and a control district where workers conducted routine immunization activities without <b>health</b> behavior <b>questions.</b> <b>To</b> evaluate the effect of EPI-CM, we conducted a cross-sectional household survey at baseline and 1 year postintervention. We used multivariate logistic regression to compare between districts the change over 1 year in 4 health behaviors: use of insecticide-treated nets, appropriate fever treatment, care-seeking for respiratory complaints, and appropriate diarrhea treatment. Results. There {{were no significant differences}} between the 2 districts in the change in the 4 health behaviors when controlling for age, sex, maternal education and occupation, immunization history, and wealth.

We conducted an online survey {{to get a better}} idea about research and production in Europe, focusing on five areas of aquaponics (i. e., demographics, facilities used, fish and crops produced, funding sources, and personal or company priorities for further development). The 68 respondents were distributed among 21 European countries, 43 % were working at a university, and 19 % were commercial producers. Only 11. 8 % of those surveyed had sold fish or plants in the past 12 months. Most respondents were male (66. 2 %) and had a post-graduate degree (91. 7 %). Facilities were generally new (74. 5 % constructed after 2010) and self-designed.

40|$|Introduction: The Ebola {{epidemic}} in West Africa sparked many ethical and polarizing public <b>health</b> <b>questions</b> on how <b>to</b> adequately control {{transmission of the}} virus. These deliberations had {{and will continue to}} influence patients, healthcare workers, public perceptions of disease, and governmental responses. Such extensive and potential ramifications warranted an analysis of prior epidemics to sufficiently inform policy makers and prepare them and other authorities for future epidemics. We analyzed how the general public, medical institutions, federal government, and patients themselves responded during {{the early stages of the}} AIDS pandemic in two different countries and cultures, the United States and India. Discussion: Our analysis identified four key findings pertaining to the human rights of patients and healthcare workers and to the crucial roles of the government and medical community. The first demands that authoritative officials acknowledge the presence of high-risk behaviors and properly educate the public without stigmatizing groups of individuals. For this task, the medical community and federal government must form and display to the public a respectful and collaborative partnership towards battling the epidemic. These two synergistic endeavors will then allow appropriate officials to implement effective, yet civil, interventions for limiting transmission. Finally, the same officials must ensure that their interventions maintain the human rights of high-risk populations and of healthcare workers. Conclusions: Applying these findings to future epidemics of infectious diseases can aid policy makers in navigating complicated ethical and public <b>health</b> <b>questions,</b> and help prevent them from repeating past mistakes in handling epidemics...|$|R
40|$|Background: Unofficial {{payments}} in health services {{around the world}} are widespread and as varied as the health systems in which they occur. We reviewed the main lessons from social audits of petty corruption in health services in South Asia (Bangladesh, Pakistan), Africa (Uganda and South Africa) and Europe (Baltic States). Methods: The social audits varied in purpose and scope. All covered representative sample communities and involved household interviews, focus group discussions, institutional reviews of health facilities, interviews with service providers and discussions with health authorities. Most audits questioned households about views on health services, perceived corruption in the services, and use of government and other <b>health</b> services. <b>Questions</b> <b>to</b> service users asked about making official and unofficial payments, amounts paid, service delivery indicators, and satisfaction with the service. Results: Contextual differences between the countries affected the forms of petty corruption and factors related to it. Most households in all countries held negative views about government health services and many perceived these services as corrupt. There was little evidence that better off service users were more likely to make an unofficial payment, or that making such a payment was associated with better or quicker service; those who paid unofficially to health care workers were not more satisfied with the service.

40|$|Background: A recent UK {{population}} {{survey of}} oral <b>health</b> included <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> assess dental anxiety to provide mean and prevalence estimates {{of this important}} psychological construct. Methods: A two-stage cluster sample {{was used for the}} survey across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The survey took place between October-December 2009, and January-April 2010. All interviewers were trained on survey procedures. Within the 7, 233 households sampled there were 13, 509 adults who were asked to participate in the survey and 11, 382 participated (84 %). Results: The scale was reliable and showed some evidence of unidimensionality. Estimated proportion of participants with high dental anxiety (cut-off score = 19) was 11. 6 %. Percentiles and confidence intervals were presented and can be estimated for individual patients across various age ranges and gender using an on-line tool. Conclusions: The largest reported data set on the MDAS from a representative UK sample was presented. The scale’s psychometrics is supportive for the routine assessment of patient dental anxiety to compare against a number of major demographic groups categorised by age and sex. Practitioners within the UK have a resource to estimate the rarity of a particular patient’s level of dental anxiety, with confidence intervals, when using the on-line percentile calculator.

40|$|Many {{cities are}} {{experiencing}} ongoing infectious disease epidemics and substantial community harm {{as a result}} of illicit drug use. In an effort to reduce these public order and public health concerns, consideration has been given to the opening in Vancouver of a safer smoking facility (SSF). The present review was conducted to examine if there is a rationale to support the evaluation of a SSF in the Canadian context. Available evidence suggests that conventional drug control strategies are insufficient to address the health and community harms of non-injection drug use, and that the public order benefits of supervised injection facilities may be relevant to SSFs. In addition, there is persuasive evidence to suggest there is potential for blood-borne disease transmission through the sharing of smoking paraphernalia, and the potential for SSFs to address this concern is a pressing public <b>health</b> <b>question.</b> Also relevant <b>to</b> this topic are interventions to prevent transition into injection drug use, and SSFs may also be evaluated as a potential strategy to address this concern.

40|$|Objective: A common {{measure of}} Internet search engine {{effectiveness}} {{is its ability}} to find documents that a user perceives as 'relevant'. This study sought to test whether user provided relevance ratings for documents retrieved by an Internet search engine correlate with the decision outcome after use of a search engine. Design: 227 university students were asked to answer four randomly assigned consumer <b>health</b> <b>questions,</b> then <b>to</b> conduct an Internet search on one of two randomly assigned search engines of different performance, and to again answer the question. Measurements: Participants were asked to provide a relevance score for each document retrieved as well as a pre and post search answer <b>to</b> each <b>question.</b> Results: User relevance rankings had little or no predictive power. Relevance rankings were unable to predict whether the user of a search engine could correctly answer a question after search and could not differentiate between two search engines with statistically different performance in the hands of users. Only when users had strong prior knowledge of the questions, and the decision task was of low complexity, did relevance appear to have modest predictive power. Conclusions: User provided relevance rankings taken in isolation seem to be of limited to no value when designing a search engine that will be used in a general-purpose setting. Relevance rankings may have a place in situations in which experts provide rankings, and decision tasks are of complexity commensurate with the abilities of the raters. A more natural metric of search engine performance may be a user's ability to accurately complete a task, as this removes the inherent subjectivity of relevance rankings, and provides a direct and repeatable outcome measure which directly correlates with the performance of the search technology in the hands of users. 4 page(s...|$|R

Longitudinal studies addressing clinical and public <b>health</b> <b>questions</b> related <b>to</b> HIV-HCV co-infection (HIV-HCV clinical progression and its determinants including genetic dimension, patients' experience with these two diseases and their treatments) are limited. The ANRS CO 13 HEPAVIH cohort was set up to explore these critical <b>questions.</b> <b>To</b> describe the cohort aims and organization, monitoring and data collection procedures, baseline characteristics, as well as follow-up findings to date. Methods Inclusion criteria in the cohort were: age > 18 years, HIV- 1 infection, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or sustained response to HCV treatment. A standardized medical questionnaire collecting socio-demographic, clinical, biological, therapeutic, histological, ultrasound and endoscopic data is administered at enrolment, then every six months for cirrhotic patients or yearly for non-cirrhotic patients. Also, a self-administered questionnaire documenting socio-behavioral data and adherence to HIV and/or HCV treatments is administered at enrolment and yearly thereafter. Results A total of 1, 175 patients were included from January 2006 to December 2008. Their median age at enrolment was 45 years and 70. 2 % were male. The median CD 4 cell count was 442 (IQR: 304 - 633) cells/μl and HIV RNA plasma viral load was undetectable in 68. 8 %. Most participants (71. 6 %) were on HAART. Among the 1, 048 HIV-HCV chronically co-infected patients, HCV genotype 1 was predominant (56 %) and cirrhosis was present in 25 %. As of January, 2010, after a median follow-up of 16. 7 months (IQR: 11. 3 - 25. 3), 13 new cases of decompensated cirrhosis, nine hepatocellular carcinomas and 20 HCV-related deaths were reported, resulting in a cumulative HCV-related severe event rate of 1. 9 / 100 person-years (95 % CI: 1. 3 - 2. 5). The rate of HCV-related severe events was higher in cirrhotic patients and those with a low CD 4 cells count, but did not differ according to sex, age, alcohol consumption, CDC clinical stage or HCV status. Conclusion The ANRS CO 13 HEPAVIH is a nation-wide cohort using a large network of HIV treatment, infectious diseases and internal medicine clinics in France, and thus is highly representative of the French population living with these two viruses and in care. </p...|$|R
