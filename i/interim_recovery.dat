[...] The <b>Interim</b> Haiti <b>Recovery</b> Commission, led by former US President Bill Clinton and Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, had been set up to facilitate the flow of funds toward reconstruction projects in April 2010, but as of January 2011, no major reconstruction had started.|$|R
40|$|Staged {{repair of}} {{extensive}} thoracic aortic aneurysms is complicated, {{with a high}} incidence of interval rupture between stages. We describe the systematic staged hybrid procedure of a previous endovascular repair of a descending aortic aneurysm and open surgical repair of an aortic arch aneurysm. In the second-stage arch repair, the stent graft was easily retracted and fixed, without dissection, around the aortic arch aneurysm distal side. Extensive thoracic aortic aneurysms were managed without interim rupture or neurologic deficits. This approach avoided the potential for <b>interim</b> rupture because <b>recovery</b> from the first-stage endovascular repair was shorter than that from open repair...|$|R

Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of State (State). In April 2010, the Haitian government created the <b>Interim</b> Haiti <b>Recovery</b> Commission (IHRC), a joint Haitian-international entity, for an 18 -month term to coordinate donors, conduct strategic planning, approve reconstruction projects, and provide accountability. In this report, GAO addresses (1) the planned uses for U. S. reconstruction assistance and the amounts provided so far, (2) USAID's internal controls for overseeing U. S. funds, and (3) IHRC's progress establishing governance and oversight structures. GAO interviewed U. S. government officials in Washington, D.

40|$|The Gulf is {{considered}} to be a young sea in decline, with poor prognosis for continuing production of abundant natural resources. We compare and contrast ‘monetary’ and ‘environmental’ compensation as mechanisms for addressing ecosystem damage in the Gulf. The 1992 International Oil Pollution Compensation Conventions settle claims financially, but only for certain categories of oil spills. For example, aside from inherent difficulties of valuing ecosystem services and their losses, ecological damage from the time of injury to <b>recovery</b> (<b>interim</b> losses) is not compensated. Another approach involves reimbursement for environmental action/projects to restore affected resources and offset impacts until recovery. In habitat equivalency analysis, mitigation requirements are calculated from the type(s), severity, duration and extent of resource impacts. This approach was utilized to resolve several claims for damage from the 1991 Gulf War oil spill. Various compensatory projects resulted, including direct oil spill remediation and other environmental projects such as the establishment of ≥ 1 protected area (x ha for y years). Besides compensation, in this paper we advocate setting threshold levels for the protection of different coastal and marine ecosystems. This could be achieved by a proportion (c. 30 %) of every major ecosystem becoming fully protected, through an expanded regional protected area network...|$|R
