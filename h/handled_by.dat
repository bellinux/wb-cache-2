5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the game}} was outsourced to a company called Bowne Global, and was <b>handled</b> <b>by</b> writer Alexander O.

They would normally have left the setting vague while adapting cultural differences that the target audience would not understand, but because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a lot about it. This became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious.
