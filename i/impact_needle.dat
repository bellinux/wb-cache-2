Due to differences in the high-frequency signal and mean sensitivity of needle parameters in Scots pine and Ponderosa pine revealed in previous investigations, variance caused by climate factors at a dry site {{in the northeast}} lowlands of Brandenburg was investigated. Although water is the general limiting factor for both tree species, there are evident differences in the climate-driven <b>impact</b> on individual <b>needle</b> parameters.

Physics theory suggests that the interaction between a non-coring needle (NCN, made of stainless steel) and a plastic base {{would lead to the}} stronger material (steel) altering the more malleable material (plastic). Objectives: To investigate whether <b>needle</b> <b>impacts</b> can alter a plastic base’s surface, thus potentially reducing flushing efficacy. Study design and methods: A Port made of POM was punctured 200 times with a 19 -gauge NCN. Following the existing guidelines, the needle tip pricked the base with each puncture. The Port’s base was then examined using a two-dimensional optical instrument, and a bi-dimensional numerical simulation using COMSOL® was performed to investigate potential surface irregularities and their impact on fluid flow. Results: Each <b>needle</b> <b>impact</b> created a hole (mean depth, 0. 12 mm) with a small bump beside it (mean height, 0. 02 mm) the Reynolds number Rek≈ 10. A numerical simulation of the one hole/bump set showed that the flushing efficacy was 60 % that of flushing along a flat surface. Discussion: In clinical practice, the number of times a Port is punctured depends on patient and treatment characteristics, but each <b>needle</b> <b>impact</b> on the plastic base may increase the risk of decreased flushing effectiveness. Therefore, the more a plastic Port is accessed, the greater the risk of microorganisms, blood products, and medication accumulation. Conclusions: Multiple <b>needle</b> <b>impacts</b> created an irregular surface on the Port’s base, which decreased flushing efficacy. Clinical investigation is needed to determine whether plastic base Ports are associated with an increased risk of Port infection and occlusion compared to titanium base Ports.

40|$|International audiencePrescribed burning (PB) {{is gaining}} {{popularity}} as a low-cost forest protection measure that efficiently reduces fuel build-up, but {{its effects on}} tree health and growth are poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the impact of PB on plant defenses in Mediterranean pine forests (Pinus halepensis andP. nigra ssp. laricio). These chemical defenses were estimated based on needle secondary metabolites (terpenes and phenolics including flavonoids) and {{discussed in terms of}} chlorophyll fluorescence and soil nutrients. Three treatments were applied: absence of burning (control plots); single burns (plots burned once); and repeated burns (plots burned twice). For single burns, we also explored changes over time. In P. laricio, PB tended to trigger only minor modifications consisting exclusively of shortlived increases (observed within 3 months after PB) in flavonoid index, possibly due to the leaf temperature increase during PB. In P. halepensis, PB had detrimental effects on physiological performance, consisting of (i) significant decreases in actual PSII efficiency (ΦPSII) in light-adapted conditions after repeated PB, and (ii) short-lived decreases in variable-to-maximum fluorescence ratio (Fv/Fm) after single PB, indicating that PB actually stressed P. halepensistrees. Repeated PB also promoted terpene-like metabolite production, which increased 2 to 3 -fold compared to control trees. Correlations between terpene metabolites and soil chemistry were found. These results suggest thatPB <b>impacts</b> <b>needle</b> secondary metabolism both directly (via a temperature impact) and indirectly (via soil nutrients), and that these impacts vary according to species/site location, frequency and time elapsed since last fire.

40|$|Part 1 of {{this paper}} {{presents}} the development and validation of a detailed dynamic model for the needle motion of a common hole‐type diesel fuel injector as used in a direct injection diesel engine. The injector needle motion {{is described as a}} two‐mass piece‐wise linear vibro‐impact system, unlike the conventional modelling techniques which use a single‐mass approach. The use of two masses permits analysis of both the <b>needle</b> <b>impact</b> behaviour and of the more general dynamics of the fuel injection process. Model parameters are derived from a combination of measurement and estimation, and the subsequent model is evaluated via direct measurement of the spring seat displacement. The opening and closing <b>needle</b> <b>impact</b> behaviour is shown to exhibit close correlation with key injection parameters, including fuel injection pressure, fuelling rate and timing. The model revealed that the <b>impact</b> of the <b>needle</b> when opening is found to exhibit lower amplitude but more high‐frequency components than the impact associated with the closing. The measurement of the injector body vibration response to these impacts is shown to enable non‐intrusive estimation of injection parameters, alleviating the problems associated with conventional intrusive needle‐lift measurement.

40|$|Environmental growth {{conditions}} and mechanisms involved in sediment transport by needle ice {{have historically been}} difficult to assess and are poorly documented. The spatial and temporal dynamics {{that relate to the}} environment, growth and decay of needle ice are not fully understood. This study monitored needle ice growth, melt and visually identified sediment displacement mechanisms by needle ice, with the aim of revealing environmental growth criteria, timing of growth/melt, ground-surface-air energy balance and sediment displacement mechanisms. Furthermore, the <b>impact</b> of <b>needle</b> ice displacement on vegetation and patterned ground formation was analysed. High-frequency visual monitoring, using three cameras, supplemented by high-frequency measurements of air temperature, soil moisture and wind speed was used to investigate needle ice growth and decay dynamics. Results from visual and environmental monitoring of needle ice growth, showed that the needle ice growing environment was more dynamic, especially in terms of surface temperature, than previously argued. Needle ice growth was observed to occur during surface temperatures from - 2. 0 °C to 2. 2 °C, soil moisture levels from 0. 4 % to 37. 4 % and in winds speeds of 0 m/s to 12. 6 m/s. Needle ice initiation was documented a few minutes to hours before or after the onset of surface temperature dropping to below 0 °C. Imagery displayed that the depth of ice nucleation was variable within the soil column, possibly relating to the energy balance of radiative cooling, convective heat loss, ground conductivity and latent heat release at the air-surface-ground boundary. Heaving and resettling, toppling and rolling were identified as slope displacement mechanisms when needle ice decayed. Animal trampling and hail were additionally documented as substantial surface altering processes. Furthermore, no <b>impact</b> of <b>needle</b> ice reducing vegetation stability was identified, although a tendency to hinder vegetation expansion was noted.

To achieve this, we conducted a review of reviews; a systematic and explicit method used to identify, select and critically appraise relevant findings from secondary level research (systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses) into an evidence briefing. In the absence of high-quality reviews, appraisal of the evidence was supplemented with a targeted review of the primary literature. We find that there is sufficient review-level evidence that OST reduces HIV transmission, while the {{evidence in support of}} NSPs reducing HIV transmission is more tentative, and for DCRs currently insufficient. There is tentative evidence that OST has limited effectiveness in reducing HCV transmission, and insufficient evidence to support or discount NSPs or DCRs' ability to reduce HCV transmission.

There is sufficient review evidence that OST reduces risk of overdose mortality, but insufficient evidence to support or discount the effect of DCRs or PND on overdose deaths at the community level.

30|$|Carbon {{stocks and}} stock changes in New Zealand’s exotic {{plantation}} forest area are estimated {{in order to}} meet international reporting commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol (IPCC 2003). Assessments of the regional performance {{of a wide range of}} exotic tree species planted in New Zealand (Beekhuis and Will 1965) revealed that Pinus radiata D.Don (radiata pine) performs well in most districts that are free of snow, which explains why this species is widely planted throughout New Zealand and currently comprises approximately 90 % of NZ’s exotic plantation forest area of 1.7 million ha. In contrast, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco (Douglas-fir), which currently comprises approximately only 6 % (NEFD 2016), performs best in southern and higher elevation areas where cold temperatures reduce the <b>impact</b> of <b>needle</b> diseases (Stone et al. 2007) on growth. Carbon stocks and stock changes over time are estimated for these species using yield tables derived from an inventory plot-based modelling system called the Forest Carbon Predictor (FCP). The FCP links stem gross and net annual volume increment predictions with estimates of wood density of annual growth sheaths (Beets et al. 2011). For radiata pine, growth sheath density is modelled as a function of site mean annual temperature, soil nitrogen fertility, and stocking (Beets et al. (2007). A growth sheath density model has not been developed for Douglas-fir. However, components of the model developed to predict the density of Douglas-fir log sections in relation to timber performance (Kimberley et al. 2017) are applicable for the estimation of carbon stock changes over time. This paper describes a model developed to predict variation in wood density of Douglas-fir growth sheaths from known drivers of wood density in New Zealand, identified previously by Kimberley et al. (2017), utilising a combination of new and existing sub-models.|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{estimate}} {{the effects of}} needle syringe programmes (NSP) and opioid substitution therapy (OST), alone or in combination, for preventing acquisition of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in people who inject drugs (PWID). METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Bibliographic databases were searched for studies measuring concurrent exposure to current OST (within last 6 months) and/or NSP and HCV incidence among PWID. High NSP coverage was defined as regular NSP attendance or ≥ 100 % coverage (receiving sufficient or greater number of needles/syringes per reported injecting frequency). Studies were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias in non-randomised studies tool. Random effects models were used in meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identified 28 studies (n= 6279) in North America (13), UK (5), Europe (4), Australia (5), and China (1). Studies were at moderate (2), serious (17) critical (7) and non-assessable risk of bias (2). Current OST is associated with 50 % (risk ratio (RR) 0. 50 95 % CI 0. 40 - 0. 63) reduction in HCV acquisition risk, consistent across region and with low heterogeneity (I(2) = 0, p= 0. 889). Weaker evidence was found for high NSP coverage (RR= 0. 79 95 % CI 0. 39 - 1. 61) with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 77 %, p= 0. 002). After stratifying by region, high NSP coverage in Europe {{was associated with a}} 56 % reduction in HCV acquisition risk (RR= 0. 44, 95 % CI 0. 24 - 0. 80) with low heterogeneity (I(2) = 12. 3 %, p= 0. 337) but not in North America (RR= 1. 58, I(2) = 89. 5 %, p=< 0. 001). Combined OST/NSP is associated with a 76 % reduction in HCV acquisition risk (RR= 0. 24 95 % CI= 0. 07 - 0. 89, I(2) = 80 % p= 0. 007). According to GRADE criteria, the evidence on OST and combined OST/NSP is low quality while NSP is very low.

40|$|Abstract Branches {{of adult}} Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees were sampled from boreal dry pine forests to study needle longevity, its {{variation}} {{and its relation}} to other shoot characteristics. The stands studied were located along transects from two smelters and one city, e. g. along gradients of pollution <b>impact.</b> Constant <b>needle</b> age structures were assumed and static life-tables generated. Mean needle longevity was calculated as the sum of the proportions of living needle fascicles on the successive annual shoots. It fully incorporated the information of the static life-tables and was preferred to median or maximum ages because of its significantly lower variation. The first half of the shedding span, the duration of the period when the needle survival gradually dropped from 90 to 50 %, proved to validly reflect the changes in the needle age structure. Needle longevity decreased 15 - 40 % towards the pollution sources along the transects studied. Near the smelters, needle longevity decreased with the increasing needle Fe, or Fe, Ni and Cu concentration that represented the main constituents of the airborne particle emissions. Near the city, needle longevity decreased with the increasing needle N and P concentrations, annual needle mass and needle mass packing and decreasing needle area packing. In the urban forests, needle Mg, P and K concentrations decreased linearly with the decreasing needle survival from the second to the fourth needle age class. Concentrations in the living needles of the fourth age class stayed over 80 % of the average for all the age classes, though needle survival dropped below 50 %. A decreasing needle Mn concentration was detected towards all the emission sources. Leaching, especially from the soil, as a possible cause was discussed. Needle longevity had the lowest variation among the shoot characteristics, which increases its value as a tool in ecological monitoring. Low plasticity in needle longevity could be an acclimation to the ambient environmental conditions and length of the growing season and to maximise the carbon gain per time. Needle longevity decreased and annual needle mass and leaf mass per area increased upwards in the crowns of mature Scots pines, reflecting the acclimation to irradiance...|$|R

MethodsWe used respondent-driven sampling to identify 408 participants, from whom we collected demographic data, information on sexual behaviours and injection drug practices, and blood samples for biological testing. ResultsPrevalence of hepatitis B surface antigenaemia, HCV, and HIV infection were 5. 9, 25. 4, and 11. 3 %, respectively. Of the participants who were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, 33. 5 % were infected with HCV and 18. 8 % were infected with HIV. Of the HCV-infected participants, 29. 3 % were infected with HIV. Of the participants who were infected with HIV, 9. 0 % were HBsAg positive, 66. 6 % had HCV and 8. 5 % had both. None of the potential risk factors we measured were associated with HBsAg positivity. In contrast, older age and longer duration of injection drug use were independently associated with HCV infection. HCV infection among people who inject drugs is lower in Zanzibar than in other countries, but could rise without proper interventions. ConclusionsThese findings underscore the importance of screening people who inject drugs for HIV, HBsAg, and HCV; providing HBV vaccination to those who are eligible; initiating antiretroviral therapy for those who are co-infected with HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV; and introducing interventions that have high <b>impact</b> on reducing <b>needle</b> sharing. 5 UGPS 002039 - 02 /U.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 A {{series of}} studies, in three western Oregon Douglas-fir plantations, was {{conducted}} to understand the physiological <b>impacts</b> of Swiss <b>needle</b> cast on Douglas-fir physiology. Four aspects of the disease complex were investigated: fungal colonization and assessment, plant-water relations, carbon assimilation and interaction with climate. Several techniques were developed and {{used to assess the}} colonization of Phaeocryptopus gaeumannii, the causal fungus, in foliage (i. e., ergosterol concentration, quantitative PCR, and visual estimates of fruiting bodies). All measures of fungal colonization were significantly correlated with each other (r [greater than or equal to] 0. 733) and with the amount of visible symptoms present (i. e., needle chlorosis and retention) (r [greater than or equal to] 0. 578). Furthermore, removal of P. gaeumannii with fungicide applications reduced visible symptoms and increased tree growth. Upon sporulation, P. gaeumannii produces fruiting bodies (pseudothecia) that emerge from needle stomata, significantly reducing gas exchange in Douglas-fir needles by physically impeding gaseous diffusion. Maximum rates of needle gas exchange (CO₂ and H₂O) were inversely proportional to the presence of P. gaeurnannii in needle stomata. Anatomical and biochemical changes, such as reduced sapwood permeability and reduced rubisco activity, associated with prolonged disease presence further reduced the capacity and duration of needle gas exchange. Climate was also shown to {{play a significant role in}} disease development. Differences associated with site topography (i. e., slope and aspect), influenced both fungal colonization and symptom development. For example, an increase in fungal colonization and symptom development was observed on foliage from south slopes, which typically experienced greater evaporative demands (i. e., increased temperature and/or 1 ower relative humidity). The cumulative effects of P. gaeumannii infection were integrated into a process-based model of photosynthesis. Modeled estimates of stomatal conductance and photosynthesis were well correlated with observed values (R²= 0. 777, R² = 0. 820, respectively). Yearly estimates of whole-canopy carbon assimilation, accounting for P. gaeumannii infection and site climate differences, were significantly correlated with tree height growth (R² = 0. 792) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} prediction of the mass injected by a gaseous fuel solenoid injector for spark ignition (SI) engines has been realized and validated through experimental data by the authors in a recent work [1]. The gas injector has been studied with particular reference to the complex needle motion during the opening and closing phases. Such motion may significantly affect the amount of injected fuel. When the injector nozzle is fully open, the mass flow depends only on the upstream fluid pressure and temperature. This phenomenon creates a linear relationship between the injected fuel mass and the injection time (i. e. {{the duration of the}} injection pulse), thus enabling efficient control of the injected fuel mass by simply acting on the injection time. However, a part of the injector flow chart characterized by strong nonlinearities has been experimentally observed by the authors [1]. Such nonlinearities may seriously compromise the air-fuel mixture quality control and thus increase both fuel consumption and pollutant emissions (SI engine catalytic conversion systems have very low efficiency for non-stoichiometric mixtures). These nonlinearities arise by the injector outflow area variation caused by <b>needle</b> <b>impacts</b> and bounces during the transient phenomena, which occur in the opening and closing phases of the injector. In this work, the {{mathematical model}} previously developed by the authors has been employed to study and optimize two appropriate injection strategies to linearize the injector flow chart to the greatest extent. The first strategy relies on injection pulse interruption and has been originally developed by the authors, whereas the second strategy is known in the automotive engine industry as the peak and hold injection. Both injection strategies have been optimized through minimum injection energy considerations and have been compared in terms of linearization effectiveness. Efficient linearization of the injector flow chart has been achieved with both injection strategies, and a similar increase in injector operating range has been observed. The main advantage of the pulse interruption strategy lies on its ease of implementation on existing injection systems because it only requires a simple engine electronic control unit software update. Meanwhile, the peak and hold strategy reveals a substantial lack of robustness and requires expressly designed injectors and electronic components to perform the necessary voltage commutation...|$|R
40|$|Experimental tests {{previously}} {{executed by}} the authors on the simultaneous combustion of gasoline and gaseous fuel in a spark ignition engine revealed the presence of strong nonlinearities in {{the lower part of}} the gas injector flow chart. These nonlinearities arise via the injector outflow area variation caused by the <b>needle</b> <b>impacts</b> and bounces during the transient phenomena that take place in the opening and closing phases of the injector and may seriously compromise the air-fuel mixture quality control for the lower injection times, thus increasing both fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. Despite the extensive literature about the operation and modelling of fuel injectors, there are no known studies focused on the nonlinearities of the gas injector flow chart and on the way they can be reduced or eliminated. The authors thus developed a mathematical model for the prediction of mass injected by a spark ignition (S. I.) engine gas injector, validated through experimental data. The gas injector has been studied with particular reference to the complex needle motion during the opening and closing phases, which may strongly affect the amount of fuel injected. In this work, the mathematical model previously developed has been employed to study and determine an appropriate injection strategy in order to linearize the injector flow chart to the greatest degree possible. The injection strategy proposed by the authors is based on minimum injection energy considerations and may be easily implemented in current engine control units (ECU) without any hardware modification or additional costs. Once calibrated by means of simulation, this strategy has been validated by experimental data acquired on an appropriately equipped injector test bench. As a result, the real injector flow chart has been substantially improved, reducing its deviation from linearity to one third of the original flow chart, which is an excellent result, especially if the typical measurement dispersion of the injected mass is taken into account. The injection strategy proposed by the authors could extend the linear behaviour of gas injectors and improve the fuel supply by means of a simple software update of the ECU, thus obtaining higher engine efficiency and lower pollutant emissions...|$|R
40|$|Short {{rotation}} plantation forestry {{based on}} exotic tree species (principally radiata pine (Pinus radiata)) {{is a major}} land use in New Zealand (1. 7 million ha, 7 % of total land area). The maintenance of primary production in such a plantation forest ecosystem depends upon {{a number of factors}} including replenishment of available nutrients removal in harvested biomass. Litterfall is a major pathway of nutrient return to the forest floor. In addition, understorey biomass and woody debris from thinning and pruning also contribute to nutrient and organic matter cycling in a managed forest. Needle litter, understorey litter and woody debris undergo decomposition to release nutrients and thereby maintain the integrity of the forest ecosystem. Substrate quality is an important factor that regulates the decomposition of litter and woody debris materials. Decomposition and associated nutrient release from selected above ground litter and woody debris components from radiata pine forests were investigated using a combination of controlled environment (microcosm) and field experiments. The principle objective {{of the study was to}} determine the influence of litter and woody debris quality on decomposition and associated nutrient release. The <b>impact</b> of green <b>needle</b> litter on senescent needle litter decomposition and nutrient turnover in the forest floor was investigated under controlled conditions (microcosm) and in the field. The results obtained indicated that green needle addition did not significantly affect organic matter and nutrient turnover. However, addition of green needles did affect short-term nutrient availability. Green needles lost 69, 87, 75, 72, and 79 % of the original nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, respectively after 10 months, while the corresponding data for senescent needles was 22, 71, 31, 4, and 38 %, respectively. The effect of selected understorey litters on decomposition and nutrient release from senescent pine needles was investigated in a microcosm experiment. After 10 months the weight loss of senescent pine needles (64 %) was significantly greater than bracken (Pteridium aquilinum- 26 %), gorse (Ulex europaeus- 30 %), broom (Cytisus scoparius- 30 %) and lotus (Lotus pedunculatus- 40 %) litter. Net release of all nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and potassium) occurred from decomposing senescent pine needles, although net immobilization of potassium was observed for all understorey litters. Mixing pine and understorey litter significantly influenced decomposition rate and associated nutrient release. Pine needles mixed with understorey litter decomposed slower than needles alone, but mixed understorey litter (except bracken) decomposed faster than understorey alone. Nutrient availability (especially magnesium and potassium) was found to be as important as energy availability in determining the overall rate of decomposition. A laboratory study on the biodegradability of dissolved organic carbon from radiata pine litter indicated that this was influenced by its quality as determined by the stage of decomposition. The aqueous extract of the litter (L) layer decomposed faster (38 %) than that of the fermented/humus (FH) layer (15 %) during 3 months of incubation. The inhibitory effects of polyphenols on the biodegradability of dissolved organic carbon was confirmed in this study. The ¹³C NMR technique was used to describe the DOC degradation. The NMR results complemented the results obtained through the proximate analyses and it gave better insights in to the pathways of Land FH DOC breakdown. A chronosequence study of woody debris decomposition over 13 years showed that the overall half- life was 14 years and decomposition of different components was clearly related to quality. Thus, log wood contained greater concentrations of carbohydrates (soluble and holocelluose) and decomposed faster than log bark and side branches. ¹³C NMR technique was used to study the decomposition of wood, bark and sidebranches over 13 years. The NMR spectra confirmed the results obtained through proximate analysis and proved to be an useful technique in understanding the process of litter decomposition. The slower decomposition rate of log bark was attributed to the higher polyphenol concentration, while higher lignin concentration and an unfavorable microclimate were the main reasons for slow decomposition of side branches. The mass and volume of woody debris was much lower than that of natural conifer forests due to the young age of woody debris (thinning slash) and net mineralization of nutrients from the decomposing woody debris was apparent during decomposition. Even after 13 years, woody debris contained considerable amounts of carbon (5. 5 t ha⁻¹) and nutrients (41, 2, 41, 8, 3 kg ha⁻¹ of nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and potassium, respectively). Therefore, management of woody debris (thinning residues) may be important for the long-term sustainability of forest soils...|$|R
